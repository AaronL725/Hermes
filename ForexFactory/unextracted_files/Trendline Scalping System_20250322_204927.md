Honestly the Fxglow rsi and mfi is better in terms of visuals.  
It makes it easier for to find setups rather than reading the graphs.  
  
But nice new thread, i will be posting here too.

"trading is so easy" as a title  
"only $30 and you have the secret indicator with ea" as a delicious line  
"a simple chart" as a trap

well on reality you will just lose ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
  
the only chance for us to win a little is to open orders randomly,  
because their main system is easy, they just move the price up when theres more sellers than buyers and when the buyers are more than the sellers they just move the price down, but when the buyers and sellers are everywhere they will get confused because if they go up some will win if they go down some will win too and that is a big problem for them, because they make the game to win money not to lose it to you ppl

i'll give you a trading secret "but not like george's fantasy secret" ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
  
when you see a strategy or an indicator or an ea that has a good potential and it get spreaded widely on the net, try in these days "preferably the first days when it get announced/posted" to take the opposite of that stra/indi or ea, you will win always because the main system of the market makers is "on" on that strategy etc... entries which is when theres more sellers than buyers the price will go up, if you do this and it doesn't work know that you are too late because the herd stop following their leaders ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) or the stra/indi/ea wasn't that popular

No RSI and MFI, it uses the default indicators found on your MT4  
  
But i still prefer the FxGlow Indicators, it is better in my opinion

i cant, i just ignore it, i still use the fxglow rsi and mfi because colors are easier.  
  
I will post my charts here sometimes but i will use the standard rsi and mfi to follow the thread rules.

Hi Swilliam,  
just a quick one, you are entering the trade on the candle on the right of the red arrow, right? Cos it says wait the close of the bar, but the red arrow was confusing me.

The candle on the right is the daily candle. Enter the trade on the close of the bar on M1/M5/M15.  
  
Obviously the daily candle is still not closed until the end of the day.

Hello everybody and thanks for your wonderful contributions to making this thread a great success. I have a suggestion which is to make a single indicator comprising of the rsi and mfi with alert to show when the agree. This i think will simplify the system.

yes, the fxglow does not give any info, but is is just better in visuals... that's all.  
  
The standard is better for in depth analysis, but in my case, my concern is if it is below or above 50%.  
So colors are more convenient ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Do you have preference of which market to trade, London and on or NYS? or it does not matter as long as the strength and volatility is there?  
for example your daily candle could be bullish from London time and then comes NYS where things could change rather quickly but you still got your d1 candle bullish.. so in such case dose your other indicator rsi or mti etc, save you from false signal.. in more or less words anything in place to detect exhaustion.  
Thx.  
(I apologize if my question is elementary, i just took a quick glance of your thread, I appreciate your time for a quick reply.)

there is daily candle indicator. See the chart above, it is a green daily candle  
  
OR just look at your D1 time frame chart.  
  
If it is green, only buy on small timeframe, red only sell

The original thread is the first few threads that I chanced upon and read, months back when I started learning about forex.  
  
I have similar indicators as the bar/histogram MFI/RSI. I can do a quick conversion and put it up here if there's any interest. Or combine both into 1 subwindow, might be unsightly though.  
  
I think the Trend Pro Scanner is the reason for the original thread to be moved to commercial since its pretty big on the chart and proprietary unlike the MFI/RSI bars which is really just a different way of presentation.

We are not sure, but the trend pro has no commercial links.  
And it is a very popular indicator that many people here in the forum use including me.  
  
The fxglow has a website attached to it and the fxglow indicators alerts on a website link  
That is most probably why.

You are entirely correct to suggest EURUSD and GBPUSD since they both have low [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide"). On the other hand the EURUSD has been terrible lately with a very low ATR; only 48 yesterday. We can only hope that it will increase next week.

Most prefer the london time.  
  
trade the direction of the daily candle on THIS time, plain and simple.  
  
Indicator that detects exhaustion no needed here, but you can add if you want

@swilliam  
Many thanks to present this strategy with such a simplicity and effective indicator, especially Daily Candle is very helpful.  
Is it possible to change the setting for the Daily candle according to specific open time?

I'm currently backtesting something similar with good success on EUR/USD. I'm not using the indicators though, just trendlines and price action.

Hello swilliam,  
  
very nice and clear PA system ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f4aa.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
Here is a Trendline alert indicator for your system, just in case subs need one. Hope it is ok to post it.  
  
By changing the trendline "name", more than one can be used and of course as a horizontal alert line too, if needed. Popup message and email alert included.

It was totally insane for the analysts to think that the RBA would lower the interest rate since it's already very low at 1.5%. Notwithstanding the market reacted negatively.

Hi lupus89, I don't know if there is a usage guide.  
The trend magic just leave "Inputs" as they come pre set.   
With the histograms, It's foreign language to me but pretty easy to guess. Here is a screenshot.

When you rely on a indicator to show you a trading opportunity, you rely on trading knowledge of it's creator. So, if they are not making money why do you think their indicators will do better? 

Money moves the market, not an indicator.

How to determine what tf to use ? If I cannot find a setup in m15, changing to m5 or m1 make sense ?

If you want a filter then get a Renko indicator with no repaint. It's the best "filter" available as a indicator. 

Money moves the market, not an indicator.

Whether an indicator repaints or not is not that relevant with Renko as long as the current data is valid. We trade in the present not the past. The trendline fast indicator repaints when you close and reopen the chart but the signals remain the same. Here is an example with the DAX. Red vertical line you sell, blue you buy and yellow you close the trade.

It's a good system for reviewing history. I would need unambiguous rules when to enter and when to step out on the right side of the chart. Best with alerts.

In the first post of this thread, download the "TMT UPDATE.zip" swilliam posted and in the indicator section you will find "TMT - Daily Candle".

You live with a eronated ideea! You need the past to make a ideea about the future. Not only in trading but in real life too. You need the spring from last year to know this year will be again a spring. I think it is enough with this example and I'll not go in polemics further. Just use your brain .

My contribution to the tread. Simple systems will work well. I will share a indicator that will alert you when trend line break by a candle. It will notify you. This will help you to focus more, make some of this strategy semi automate.

I agree with you but repainters are not all the same. Nothing worse than an indicator that repaints after you already entered into a trade but this has never happened to me with the trendline fast indicator.

TMT (Trend-Momentum-Trendline) is a trend scalping trading system based on a set of trend indicators and oscillators. It is developed for MetaTrader 4 for working on short timeframes. The system is founded on a trendline breakthrough in the direction of trend and market momentum.

TMT is a trend scalping system with one purpose only.....and that is to promote the hell out of the Trend pro products that Pollen is doing with his posts. The original TMT thread was made commercial because FF finally caught on to what these guys were doing... A few days later Swilliam creates this thread with trend line breaks so pollen can make more posts with those products on his screenshots.  
  
Pollen is being careful not to make too many posts on this thread in case it becomes commercial again....![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f600.png?v=15.1)

sadly, that's the case. after years of successful trading and sharing numerous winning trades, pollen is trading at 0.2 lots. not sure if hes trolling or not, but even my children trades at a minimum 1 lot.

Pollen teaching your children how to properly trade forex is the best education that you can give them. This is because they are learning a business so they won't have to look tor work to make a living. I hope they succeed in making a good living out of it like many of us here ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Since im fulltime, i only trade when im on the screen.  
I have alerts, but dont need them necessarily  
  
The important alerts to consider to TMT is the daily candle and the trend.

A good job is great...trading is not for everybody.  
But later they might consider once they retire.  
  
Anyway, congrats to your kids for having good jobs. Usually kids these days are broke because of too much social media

You all are welcome guys. Happy to feel it worthy.  
  
@Refilla  
  
01\. if this indi works on HTF like H4 an D1?  
  
Yes of course this works in anytime frame.  
  
02\. why is it valid until 19.12.30 ?  
  
Usually i do this because when testing we are able to find bugs. if there were, i need to update. So when there is a expiry this will not spread more and more. I experienced this. When i use some indicators those are full of bugs but still they are spreading although there are new updated versions. That is why i usually put a expiry.When expires specially me inspire to see new updated versions. I like to feel i do best although i cannot perfect 100%. Sometimes this may be a crazy idea of myself ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f602.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f602.png?v=15.1). I will post later without expiry. Thanks

Thank you I will tell them ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) I fully paid for their university education and with good degrees they both got a good job in their chosen field. Unfortunately this is not the case for everyone and kids finish university with a degree and lots of debt. In many countries student loans can be wiped out by going bankrupt but it's not the case in the US. All student loans must be repaid and even going bankrupt will not erase that debt. Young people with student debt are stuck because they cannot progress quickly in life like prior generations did.

Usually i do this because when testing we are able to find bugs. if there were, i need to update. So when there is a expiry this will not spread more and more. I experienced this. When i use some indicators those are full of bugs but still they are spreading although there are new updated versions. That is why i usually put a expiry.When expires specially...

Thanks for the Indicator Bro. Did you consider all the rules for the alert? or is it just alert when price breaks the trend-line?  
I have used this yesterday for M15 timeframes in different pairs. However I got just one alert. Am I missing something here?

Alwin

Unfortunately this is not the case for everyone and kids finish university with a degree and lots of debt. In many countries student loans can be wiped out by going bankrupt but it's not the case in the US. All student loans must be repaid and even going bankrupt will not erase that debt. Young people with student debt are stuck because they cannot progress quickly in life like prior generations...

You are welcome Alwin. **Not all the rules** only when **candle break trend line** it will alert. ( Candle close break outside the trend line not even by the wick )

I made a another simple indicator assist to this strategy traders. It will show clearly when 7 EMA < 20 EMA = Bearish and 7 EMA > 20 EMA = Bullish. This will help you.  
Thanks.

Hello. It looks like you forced the 3rd and 4th setups, because your trendlines are ignoring the candles in between to draw it and even cutting some. Any reason to do it that way?  
  
May i take a look to your last week history using this system please?, i would like to see how profitable it is to an active member that's used to it. Thanks.

usually you don't need to wait for a trend line , you can use even support and resistance

this is the best EA for trading trend lines , just draw the trend line and name it (buy) or (sell).. for example it will open a trade when candle close below the trend line if its sell .. it gives notification and take orders

yes , because the price at least will back for retest for many pips which will allow you to gain some pips

tried to shoot early on the ey and the eu. went against the daily candle looking to break the 100 and 50 marks. daily was flicking on the eu but not the ey. both failed. stops were kept tight so I only lost a little. still holding an ozzie at even. against the daily as well. long wick at the top so went for it.

again against the daily candle because of long upper wick pending sell limit on swissy. all other rules comply. switched from using my OHLC heiken ashi alert to ema crossover. alert . less noise. long ema set to 12 so its right in between the 7 and 20 TMT emas.. sell limit has hit. sitting at even right now with ozzie 1 pip in the green.

swissy, is not complying. serves me right going against daily candle. not stopped out yet but close. looking to make my life easier so using crossover as a heads up. then adding trendline with alert for the final confirmation. This in turn will help with chart watching. ozzie still holding at +or-1. chop chop chop

Please confirm RSI and MFI rules  
  
They should be above/below 50 on trend line break only ? because before break of trend line they can go sideway.  
  
If trend line is break and we should wait until RSI and MFI for entry ??

above 50 for buy bel;ow 50 for sell. I set mine at RSI 8 and MFI for 14.  
  
I am still testing and learning. it seems that we are looking for "fast longer candle on break which would correspond to a jump of both RSI and MFI.   
  
I am finding the m5 noisy and may switch to m15. it looks quieter and less false signals. It also very choppy this morning. this system works best when a clear direction forms. basically its just entering on the pullbacks. a 123 pattern

Its a moving Average crossover. Fast MA is set to 1 (line chart) and slow MA is set to 12 to be between my 7EMA and my 20 EMA. Its just alerts me that price is inbetween the moving averages. it does not give me a signal.  
  
  
The trendline break is the signal to get ready but Im finding it to be a little late. but thats ok.

I have my trade manager on my trades now and am in positive territory on three of the 4 so I can write a little bit on how to optimize this system.  
  
below is the M15 of the ozzie. Y0ou can see the long banner spreading over several days. this is a good time to us m5 and realize your tp will be small.   
  
the market does this about 70% of the time.  
  
In contrast you have days like the blue square.   
  
Here is where you need to keep patient and trail your stop. Today is a banner day. Tomorrow might be a runner. just remember that runners are less likely..   
  
Keep your stops tight. if you are wrong you are wrong. document it and move on. it will help you if you journal it.   
  
Never move a stop to give a trade "room to breathe" . only a big loss can hurt you.

Im holding a buy from an m5 signal a while back but now on m15 its showing almost a sell signal. The MFI is still above 50 and the daily candle is green. but all the other elements are there. maybe time to tighten the stop and move on. chop chop chop

eu and ey buys banked 9 pips profit at 80z% letting the remaining 20% ride and squeeze the stop while raising the Take profit. free and clear trade at this pooint. worse case scenario I break even with the 20% plus spread. Being a banner day, Im not expecting much. Once my trades are free and clear I start looking at swing positions. To either let my remainders ride or to hang on to a runner.   
  
The euro is still ooking strong on the h1. The ozzie has bottomed out so I will be setting that TP at the bottom and waiitn for a bounce. The cable is also looking strong so Im still holding that with a 2 pip loss as of now.

That swissy is being a turd! Chop chop chop. If you are still holding it its the right position in swing position. My sell was stopped out. Banner days suck.

I have been asked to upload the EMA crossover signal.. RemeMber that this is ONLY to alert you that price is inside the MAs. I reset it on my template with the fast MA set to 1 and slow MA set to 7 to let me know there is a pullback. I changed it from 12 because I noticed when price was moving fast the MA would not retreat enough to generate a pullback signal.  
  
THIS IS ONLY A HEADS UP INDICATOR! IS IS NOT A SIGNAL TO BUY OR SELL. THE TRENDLINE BREAK IS THE SIGNAL. THIS IS ONLY TO LET YOU KNOW TO PAY ATTENTION TO THAT CHART AND DRAW YOUR TRENDLINE.

yup that was a good one. Missed it. had to run out to the bank. I'm starting to get the hang of it now. Nice pull back system. Could rack up some pips in a run.   
  
My eu and ey remainders are stopped out. Draghi draggin the euro down after a bad Empire state report.. I'm still practicing and saving up to go live. I can save faster than I can trade for now so when I know I can trade faster than I save I will go live. Great system. thanks!

looking at adding these instead of the commercial trend indicator. the first pullback is the best and I went looking for a supertrend indicator that would alert to trend changes, this has it all. not as simple as trend pro but looks just as effective. I will set it up tonight. my time is still limited so I may only get one trade in before work. work keeps getting in the way of making pips.

I used the super trend before and the halftrend, but i prefer the trend pro.  
  
Trend Pro is more profitable in my experience with TMT Scalping ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
But we are not allowed to talk commercial things here, might get ignored.

Hey Guys, interesting thread. I tried to recreate the old "bar style" MFI and RSI indicators because it is easier to look at than a line, I have attached them, feel free to use them if you like. You can test if they match(they should) by lining them up with the RSI and MFI and comparing.

I know beggars cant be choosers but could you have a color change for over bought and oversold as well? I think that could be used for help with exits. They don't have to be different colors. Just a third color when RSI>70 or <30\. I could try and tinker with it but not sure where to put the else statement.

Pollen. If you right click the chart and go to Objects list ---list all

The blue and red line on your is called what indicator ? That indicator is good to determine the market trend.

Buy on gu. it was slow breaking the line. I waited for MFI on this one to catch up . Partial TP at 15 remainder riding to Monthly resistance.

Looks good. depending on the timing. I saw the uy take a plunge later this morning so Im sure there was green .  
  
Trade manager is on my gu so I have to work now. Not the momentum I was hoping for because of tough resistance ahead. but went right inot the green. halfway to BE.

My last trade broke even. But I tend to cover my trades quickly. BE trades are win trades IMO when scalping. Unfortunately, my time is limited and Im only home and awake during the slowest session. If you follow the rules, this is a good system.   
  
Some of the enhancements beyond the rules I recommend.  
Wait for an excited candle to break the trendline. If its just drifting its probably a false start but the MFI may filter it out. redraw your line.  
Trade after London open. There is a thing called the "franki Fake" As frankfurt opens China and Japan are closing up so there is a lot of indecsion in the hour before London.   
Try to get the First signal on a trend change. These are the most probable to run. the second has less pips available.   
  
I'm keeping this book marked and going up to daily TF for something else. Pullback trading is a time tested pattern that works. With these filters and the rules I venture to guess your win rate could get as high as 70%. But 60% is more than adequate.

in on the gu. More downside. The frankie fake will probably take me out but that's the way it goes when you can only trade before it. added super trend MTF. set to 60 and m5 for better confirmation. The 60 will be my alert to longer term trends. the five will heelp with confirmation. BE at 7 Partial TP at 15 Final at hourl;y support. Stop loss 10

Does it matter if the D1 candle does not close??   
  
For example. if the D1 candle indicator shows bull bar but the candle isnt close yet .. follow that direction for a buy?

halo, attached below is a modified file of rsi-filter that i downloaded free from <https://www.best-metatrader-indicators.com/rsi-filter/>  
the original code doesnt function like what this thread intends to..  
  
since i want it to function like what this thread system which is to show rsi(8) >50 (one colour) and <50 (another colour), i modified the code a little..  
n from there i modified again for mfi(14) to show again >50 and <50 conditions..  
  
note: i'm not a programmer, just someone who understands codes a little and since the codes are not complex n free, why not changed it a little.. hope it is useful and error free..  
  
oh if the indicators does not function as stated, do tell me, i will delete the post.. thx

Hi Sr. Pollen,  
  
I've a question about the Targets for profit in the 5M timeframe. If we decide to divide the trade in 3 exit points, TP1, TP2 and TP3, the 1st point (TP1) it would be about how many pips in general? 10 pips? 1 x ATR? and the other 2 points, TP2 and TP3?  
  
Understanding the money management has been the difficult part for me in Forex.

Hello Everyone,  
  
I have a suggestion for you to give more probability to this system.  
  
Examine your H4 candlestick patterns and the 'recent' price levels those patterns are bouncing of. For example, scan the market for a H4 bullish/bearish engulfing pattern and it has to be on a previous S/R. This will give you an edge in trading the 5 min chart.  
  
Yesterday, I made 50+ pips on three trades: Long USDCAD (12 pips) , Long GBPJPY (36 pips), Long EURCHF (16 pips). Check your charts every three or four or 5 hours to scan good looking and textbook candlestick formations (You can use a period converter to get custom TFs). I scanned yesterday every four hours and found a couple of good looking bullish engulfing patterns. But be mindful with how big the candle is, how much price has moved. Is there room for some more pips. There is a lot of commonsense and how you feel the trade.  
  
Now, on the M5 and M15 and M1 charts, you can definitely use your system in this thread and you can add some basic PA common sense. For example, false breaks on LTFs in the opposite direction for good stop-loss positioning, tops, bottoms, wedges, divergences, etc. Wait for some form of PA building on the LTFs in addition to the 7,21 EMAs pullback used in this thread.  
  
I would avoid H1 candles as they may mislead you and concentrate on four-hour candles to get the very immediate bias/momentum and trade accordingly.  
  
\------  
  
First pic is H4  
Second is M5

Another example with GBPNZD.  
  
In this one, I will use the setting you are following here in this nice thread and I will apply my own analysis or the way I trade these small TFs of M5 and M1 with regard to the overall relevant PA. I hope you all do.

Entry chart could be M5 or M1 or M2 or even Range/Renko bars. M1 is used here with your template.  
We will notice that waiting for the right PA on M1 (the bottoming) timed very well with the entry conditions of the system.

Note that when I trade, I do not really like the incomplete Head and shoulder patterns because of what I mentioned before in the M30 chart. It is tricky to find the true level for the second shoulder.

> Hello Everyone, I have a suggestion for you to give more probability to this system. Examine your H4 candlestick patterns and the 'recent' price levels those patterns are bouncing of. For example, scan the market for a H4 bullish/bearish engulfing pattern and it has to be on a previous S/R. This will give you an edge in trading the 5 min chart. Yesterday, I made 50+ pips on three trades: Long USDCAD (12 pips) , Long GBPJPY (36 pips), Long EURCHF (16 pips). Check your charts every three or four or 5 hours to scan good looking and textbook candlestick...

Similar trend line approach - extract the essential from Itchimoku and use that one line as a trend line:

Sure thing.  
  
First of all, it is all about the bigger picture with this GBPCAD short trade that netted around 18/19 pips.  
  
On H what can we see? We have an S/R Level. We have an incomplete or immature inverse head and Shoulder forming. We have the first shoulder, bottoming of the pattern and the second shoulder is where we are shorting. What significance would this make to our M5 scalp? Well, Identify your territory. What are our borders? How big the move to expect?   
  
We are purely inside a range at the time of entry in the right shoulder.  
  
The second thing on H4, price is clearly rejecting the Level and here we plan for the entry immediately after the red candle that closed on the same level of the green one. There was also a shooting star H4 candle before that as well. Anyway we have a confirmation there is a fall and we need to find entries on M5/M15 or M1.

On M5, we had a break out south and I put my target above a daily pivot line and 38.2 fib retracement. Price went 30 pips further south.

10 pips should have been fine but I set a target by observing a key level on 15 min timeframe so my target was approx 16 pips

i did not include rules for wick length. you can follow the rules on the main thread.  
Add others if you want

good start of the day; was almost late to react on this one but rejection of the pullback gave a good entry opportunity

AUD USD +7, pretty straightforward

I have two weeks vacation so I will be able to test some new ideas I have for this system. I have incorporated Precision money Management and an updated version of what I call For sure trades whereby you can amp up Money management.

The red lines are where I was stopped out. The green lines are where I took profits. However I used 2% MM on first trade so as of right now I am only up .75% on the day because I lowered my risk to 1%. I have some errands to run so Ill be back later with more details.

Hey guys, first of all, nice thread, just out of curiosity, a question for the long term traders of this method, what winrate are you guys experiencing given a 1:1 RR?

2 trades from today - Loss and a win  
  
Made a mistake on this GA trade.  
From my experience- the best setups are those that are poised to make a new high/low of the day. Middle can be an uncertain ground.

Hello guys!) I’ll insert my five cents.  
Firstly, the DailyCande indicator does not take into account the time of the terminal. And this, in turn, is very important. After all, the strategy is based on the assumption that the movement begun in the Asian session will continue in the London and American sessions. You can see this in the attached images. On my terminal, broker time + 3GMT. One indicator does not take into account the time of the broker, the other takes into account.

Secondly, this trading system is not completely independent.  
The signals of the system must be strictly filtered on higher timeframes. And probably the most important thing is to be able to build trend lines. And understand where to build them is not necessary. If anyone is interested, you can verify this by running the adviser. In general, it fully works according to the rules of the system.

actually the daily candle can vary a bit depending on broker GMT offset.  
I have been using a broker with +3. System works good.

This is a very good system if it is part of another system. Perhaps in conjunction with your tools, it gives good results. But based only on the files of the first post, it will obviously lead to a loss of money. I will make my small contribution to this thread). Maybe someone will be useful. In the attachment is the DailyCandle indicator, in it you can set the time for the start of trading.

looking at how a larger sample starts to look, this is probably correct  
  
however, if you introduce a discretionary filtering system the whole thing becomes a discretionary system; therefore any possible filtering on a higher timeframe needs to be non-discretionary as well  
  
I will post results once I hit like 75 trades or something

Hi,  
  
do you mind other timeframes at all when you evaluate your trades?  
  
because in your recent buy on EU almost every higher TF shows a downtrend.

I agree with the Eur/Usd being in a downtrend on all the Higher timeframes, but I think because it's scalping the HTFs are less important, because you don't want to be in the trade for very long but maybe @pollen can shed some light here. Thanks

i was just curious because on his images it shows this "trend pro scanner" thing and that indicates his general interest in looking what the price does in higher timeframes.  
  
would be nice if you can clarify Mr. Pollen ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

just the current timeframe. Just follow the rules mentioned on the first post.  
  
You can use higher Timeframe on some instances, and it can help you get more profit per trade.  
  
Usually when counter trend, i get only 10pips max.  
  
When with the trend, i can extend further

You dont need to use the trend pro scanner.  
Its just my personal taste to add to TMT and been using it for more than 1 year.  
Keeps trend filtering simple and stress free and fast.  
  
You can just follow the rules on the first post and add any indicator you want. Im not here to discuss about commercial stuff, there is a commercial thread.  
  
  
Buy +12 pips, Sell +20pips. Both followed TMT rules.  
  
**BUT Obviously Sell was with the trend (higher TF trend) so i decided to ride it**

To those who are new to this system. All the rules are outlined on the first post.  
Don't complicate things. You can add some filters as long as the principle is intact.  
  
**First experience the system before asking things such as modifying it.**  
**Later you will know what needs to be added depending on your trading style and risk tolerance**  
  
  
**Have a good weekend**

Profit is on the other side of your mind

For the sake of those of us who wont do the trend line thing, maybe this would help.

With GBP down more than 20% since BREXIT was announced my favorite trades is to sell anything with GBP in it the best being GBPNZD. Nice trade Pollen but I would not have taken it since shorts have been better over the last 3 years ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Thanks for posting and the indis, Intrepidpips. Cannot figure out how to remove the buy/sell function in the right upper corner - do not see it in the indies list.

It's the panel for the Ding Dong Order EA, attach the EA to the Experts Folder and load the template again, then you'd be able to use the panel. however I will make a new post without the EA shortly.

It helps to know or at least gauge the likelihood of which pairs will have uni-directional movement and wait for them.  
  
That is what I've attempted to put together here.  
  
The ADR indicator highlights the the pairs that have moved the highest in the past 5 days and the Currency strength indicator gives the relative strength of the individual currencies.  
  
I did not include the Ding Dong order EA so you can add that at your choosing.

I hate NFP because all brokers increase their [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") before the news comes out.

@Pollen - many thanks for posting your screenshots, however I do have one little gripe: they don't contain the original system's 7 and 20 EMAs and as I don't have the indicators you're using, and don't understand what they are showing, I'm finding it a little difficult to follow how you identified the signal.  
  
Would you be able to post screenshots without the Trend Pro stuff and show the EMAs instead in future? Alternatively, could you point me to a source for a description of how to read the indicators you're using please? Please feel free to PM me if that would be easier.  
  
Cheers,  
Paul.

For the people looking for the TLP scanner, I believe it’s available in mql5. Search for it in the market.  
(Side note, I do not have/ own it myself)

do not waste time, because for the pro scanner indicator, you need an email and password to be able to use it.  
email and password obtained when you buy from the owner.

I havent been trading this lately because I am busy having a great quarter with stocks  
  
Just wanted to share my results which I logged in from Sep 1 to Oct 10  
  
Total 54 trades  
31 wins - 23 loss  
  
Net Pips (ECN account) - 110  
  
days traded -21  
most trades per day - 5  
  
Overall it works if you are aware of the higher time frame and able to read price action, but the average of cca 5 pips per day is not enough for me

I aim for 20 pips a day and when this is achieved I close my MT4. Trading a few lots you can make a living with 20 pips a day.

you cannot plan how much you are going to make tomorrow, but you can plan how much you can make on average over the next, lets say..quarter  
  
Few pips per day does not justify my time as my opportunity cost is much higher

20pips a day consistently takes years of practice...

If you do this blindly you get burned pretty fast! Also if you do it with Currency strength and daily candle you get burned. Do Technical Analysis correctly, _combined_ with this Strategy and you could see some Profits.

You are right saying that it takes years of practice to consistently make 20 pips a day. I have been trading forex since 2006 and I don't make 20 pips every day; sometimes more sometimes less and I also have my fair share of losing trades. 20 pips a day is an achievable goal but is somewhat optimistic, better would have been to state 100 pips a week except for the summer months and between 15 December and 15 January when the market slows down. One important thing is to never stop learning even when using an excellent system ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

you can set your SL and TP on that range and leave your chart. No need to wait if you are busy ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Even very good systems will give bad results from time to time even if you followed the rules religiously. This is because systems depends on the market but the market is totally independent and often likes to fool even the best system ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Please read the first post. As you can see the system works best on the break of the trendline. No trendline break = no trade.  
You might want to try the TMT Scalping System at <https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=577639> since it is the same but for some people it's easier to use.  
Here is a copy of the system that you will find on the first page of that thread.

i have noticed that when the indicator goes horizontal (reflecting consolidation), one can start drawing the trend line and trade in direction of the color.

This is because Pollen is using two paid indicators that are not part of the original strategy.

all the indicators are found on the first post. i just changed the MA to another trend indicator which is more reliable for me  
  
You need to use the original indicators and get used to it before using other indicators

TMT scanner is just a tool that can help you to find the signals.  
  
No, you cannot change the settings of 'super trend candles'.

Hi BP  
  
thanks for your awesome work with the scanner.  
  
I have a little issue, every time i change currency the alerts goes from on to off in the button on the charts and I get no alerts.  
  
Is this a bug or?  
  
Thanks again

You are less pip hungry than me but you probably get better results in the long term.

I posted this indicator in TMT since it can be used as a trend filter but it can also be used as a good trend indicator.

No, this is not a bug.  
I turn it OFF when you changed the symbols. (please read 'ReadMe' file)  
If I don't turn it OFF, you will get many alerts again and again when you changed the symbols.

Nice trades you've been busy today. Your chart shows an ideal trade on GBPCHF. I can't say if you get a better signal when the price touches MA20 since it could also be a reversal signal.

Hey m8 awesome work as always would you mind to share a screen with the setting that you are using? For example u set inner trend filter to true and touch ma20 to true right? What about currency filter do we set it to true or not?

There are many signals comes a day. Is there anything to filter the trade? is There are any special rules with Pivot point? I mean under Pivot point sell entry and above pivot point buy entry?

If we set all the filters to true there are way less signals so that should be the filters that we need.

Hello [ bp2000, thank U for Ur effort. Do U think would be reasonable to add mtf function to U scanner, also horisontal and verical align](https://www.forexfactory.com/bp2000).  
The ide is put few scanner indi to one window chart M1 and change mtf to currency - this way we could have some kind of dashboard.  
Thank U.

Hey I’m looking into buying pipfinite trendpro. I see you use it on your charts. Is it a decent indicator? Do you use it for entires or do you use it only for the visual aid?   
  
thanks!

Hi. How do you manage your trading frequency with such strategy? Trade every setup? Which trading hours? Maybe a fixed max. hours per day rule? A fixed profit or loss limit for a day, week, month?

No man go look bp post he is not using pipfnite only pollen is posting chart with pipfnite but before asking about Indi learn the basic rule go first post study the system and try it on demo than if you think it's a good system you can think about adding new filters.

Here is the setting How to catch this signal:  
MaTrendFilter = true  
InnerTrendFilter = true  
MFIFilter = true

A setting about TMT-Scanner you must to know:  
  
**TrendLineA, TrendLineB, TrendLineC, InnerSignal** is a **GROUP**  
  
Example 1:  
TrendLineA = true  
TrendLineB = true  
TrendLineC = true  
InnerSignal = true  
Any **ONE** of them are matched means "Matching"  
  
Example 2:  
TrendLineA = false  
TrendLineB = false  
TrendLineC = false  
InnerSignal = true  
That means "InnerSignal" **must** be matched.

Look like stumbled upon something big. This way of trading, SCALPING, and this Strategy already proving its usefulness even in Indian Derivative market.   
But one must remember it is SCALPING strategy, shoot and scoot.

Would you mind to explain what are TrendLineA, TrendLineB, and TrendLineC? I couldn't find it anywhere in this Thread.  
  
By the way, what indicator do you use to show the blue and red dots？  
  
Thanks

TrendLineA is trendline from swing point to second high/low.  
TrendLineB is trendline from swing point to last high/low.  
  
Here is the two indicators I call it TrendLineC and InnerTrend

Hi BP,  
Sorry newbie question...  
So this EA will trade automatically? Or you have to enter manually?  
Or this is a different EA from the one that shows on your MT4 screen? Thx

does anyone know any arrow indicator or signal that emits only signals in favor of the trend not against the trend? or that serves to inhibit signals from other indicators against the trend, such as a trend filter. or a trend tracker ...  
if there are any, could you send me or at least the name of that indicator? I’m not trying to assemble a template with confluence of signals and I would like to have a trend filter ... just select the signals in favor of the trend

Hi bp2000,  
You are doing amazing job to the community. Can you please explain your charts a bit more. Trendline A, B, C and inner trendline is very confusing. If you have time, please consider to explain your indicators and method. Thankyou very much.

horizontal lines are also good, but my experience gives less reward.Unless you caught a strong breakout.

I think filtering breakouts with Bollinger bands will reduce your profit while you will miss many profitable trades. Bands are good only in range market

Filtering breakouts with Bollinger Bands (InnerTrendBB) and first MFI+RSI met after ZZ (InnerSignal) may miss some profitable trades in STRONG TREND.  
  
Here are some example.  
  
So, you can try to switch it ON or OFF.

Thank you for the new version TMT-Scalper v1.70 that produced these great trades. Keep on trucking ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) In case you don't know it means continue to do well.

Version 1.70 seems have a bug.  
  
Signal on scanner was visible only for short period maybe is wrong signal.

Thank's for your job.  
I would like to ask you two questions:  
1) Is the system just an indicator or have you also done an EA?  
2) Does the system trace the visible trend line?  
  
Sorry for my questions but I have everything installed now and the market is closed.

Hi bp,  
Here is the indi I was talking about. It is a version of the Alma that was modified by Hayseed.  
It has the zigzag built into it and provides alerts when in the direction or not in the direction of zz.  
The only problem is the alerts are none stop. Super annoying.  
If we could limit the alerts to only 1 occurrence and make them user input of yes/no.   
Then I think it something could provide further confirmation.  
  
Let me know what you think.  
  
tks,  
cdk

Does your broker allow trading 24/7? For those that don't BTCUSD will open with a gap.

Hi Pollen,  
how do you check all the currencies?  
I understood your system and I think it is very interesting but working manually.  
How do you understand when a currency starts to have the right conditions?  
Do you get help from some alert?  
  
Thanks for your help

Alert setting is in "Input" tap  
and you also need to turn the button as "Alert ON" (red color)

Hi,  
I have been watching this thread and wanted to ask if it is effective on higher timeframes?  
  
I watch support and resistance, then candle action for entering a trade.  
  
This trendline approach could be good to support my trading ideas?  
  
I thought trendlines were too difficult to get correct often enough to be effective, but your thread has helped.

The Trendline Scalping System is good on any timeframes. If you use the fxglow MFI and RSI they were not designed to be used above the M15 timeframe.

Did you draw this line by yourself? I am using TMT to test, but there is no line in my template. Is it hand-drawn according to the price?

I think we should open two chars.  
One is for TMT-Scanner only. One is full of indicators and a simple "Symbol Changer".  
Because TMT-Scanner is based on "Symbols Changer", when we change the symbol, we need calculate all symbol's signal. It is too slow when we change the symbol.  
  
But in this case we cannot draw trendline.

What settings do you use on TMT Scanner?  
You get signals with "Inner trend filter" set on ?

Dear Pollen.. i am new one of this trading method. so thanks a lot for sharing of this system. so i have to verify some thing with you about this system.  
  
shall i use this system in manually (that mean draw a trend line in manually)  
  
other thing is before closing of the day how can we confirm the daily candle is green or red (because the color can be change very immediately)  
  
as a experience person of this method ,do you have to wait with the PC much more time when you doing the trading ? (having very stress )  
  
so some time i am can be wrong ,but if you have a free time please write me to clarify the above issue  
  
regards

Honestly the Fxglow rsi and mfi is better in terms of visuals. It makes it easier for to find setups rather than reading the graphs. But nice new thread, i will be posting here too. **But the OLD thread is like home for me!!!**

Pollen would you mind sharing some information around how you manage your positions? Its difficult to see as you haven't posted any loosing trades. Do you move your stop to BE at a certain point? Or if a trade starts going against you do you just let it do its thing until it either stops you out or goes back into profit? More information around this would be much appreciated.

Hi Pollen,  
  
Interesting strategy. Do you enter trade after candle closed beyond the trend line or once it cross the trendline you drawn?

Hello, I have already heard this post.  
I am trading this strategy today.  
So far it looks very personal contacts.  
I already have a lot of strategic ones, this one of my own inspires me.  
Before each day I have one or the other trade to exchange personal rights with you, whether this trade is a wise investment war or not.   
I heard her that I heard myself. Because I heard mine before trading. Please blame my English, it's not that good.  
  
Greetings 77LK

Hi bp2000,  
It's good to see you!  
How about sharing what you have and maybe we can assist with a filter?  
I am using your initial system everyday with good results.  
  
tks,

Nice Trade again.  
  
Those who use this strategy, which exit strategy do you use?  
That would be interesting.  
  
Do you work with partial closings or RR = 1: 1?

Hi to everyone,  
I just discovered this wonderful thread only yesterday![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f625.png?v=15.1) and I like it very much for its simplicity. I started testing it based on bp2000's latest scanner with very good results and I would like to add maybe one good filter to it - Auto Fibonacci trading zones - see attached picture, where there is a Buy signal now, but it is in Red zone means possible trend reversal to sell, so I will not take it. So basically buy rule in Blue zone or near it and sell in Red zone or near it. Easy. If you think it is interesting I can post this indicator or you can google for it, its free on net.  
Thanks.  
Regards,  
Tea

One more example with nice current trade based on AutoFibonacciTradingZone TP is positioned on 61,8% line - around 19 pips profit. see picture.

back to my 1st post where I described the basics of AFTZ - there were a Buy signal and see it turned to opposite so it was good that I do not take this Buy signal

Dear bp2000 could you please check the scanner as I found some limitations regarding symbols using suffix as I can put manually only 23-24 instead of 28 without suffix.  
Thanks a lot.

Max symbols is 30

Excellent, that's the default. I've been trying that today paper trading with a model where longs were taken either above 50% or when the price was in the buy zone (or had touched it in the last 5 candles) and vice versa for shorts. 0.2% risk for initial trades and 0.1% for continuation trades from 09:00-14:00.  
  
Would be a healthy 1.1% up with 0.3% still in play ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Ideal targets are support and resistance or recent swings. Filter trades based on the risk reward ratios of your SL and TP

Hello, thank you for the back test, do you mind sharing what was the RR in this series of trades and did you manually trade these or used a script? Thank you.

Thank you, I will back test 1:1 first and of course it all depends on setup thats why its dynamic, I was just curious if you used ATR or any signal based on indicator for SL.

OK. But what if the daily candle is green like doji. You do not know how will the candle look like. Can someone explain how to decide about the candle red or green, or what he does then daily price is mostly ranging.

I agree 100% with Pollen. If you aim for a few pips of between 7-12 and all the rules observed, you most often win the game.

In this approach, trend line are best drawn manually because you get to learn the system in a traders point of view.  
Not relying to indicators to draw trend lines and support resistance levels is must have skill any traders should learn.

It says in the first post stop loss 10-30 pips. How do you decide your stop loss and take profit? Do you go for 1:1 0r 1:2 risk reward? Or do you you use support and resistance?  
  
Thank you,  
Yana

Hello, Pollen! How much do you set take profit in points in a trade? Do you have a fixed take profit?

This is dynamic and depends on market structure. If you are starting, you can use SL and TP 12 pips which is 1:1

my tp is usually 5 to 15pips, unless i caught a big breakout.  
  
If your starting out, try to use 10-12pips on London session only

As per the rules aren't the histograms below supposed to be blue when you taking a buy?   
And price be between moving averages but you don't use the moving averages at all?  
  
Seems like you are trading your own trendline strategy because it looks nothing like the initial rules.

You must be new. Well see the histograms here on the entry point??? They are Blue  
  
I mentioned that i dont use moving averages. I replaced them with a better trend filter of my preference.  
But those who begin the system need to use MA first and see what works for them.  
  
The core of the system is Drawing Trendlines

I'm not exactly new, I used to follow the original TMT system, I was just wondering that if you don't use the rules intended for the strategy and use your own tools instead which no one else has, then I really don't see how your posts help anyway else to be honest since no one else uses the indicator you use.   
And I'm yet to see a single losing post from you aswell.  
  
Im saying this because too many times threads die because people start changing the original method and start putting their own indicators instead of just opening a new thread of their own.

All I'm saying is it would be nice if people followed the rules of the thread so that everyone is trading the same way with the same indicators and exiting the same way aswell so that everyone learns ,  
Because I don't see how the group grows or anyone else learns by modifying the rules and using paid Indicators and having your own exit which is totally different from the strategy. Atleast post losing trades so that people learn, I haven't seen a single losing trade.  
  
I'm not being negative, his method might work very well actually, but I just think people should stick to the thread rules or if they want to modify the strategy they should also change the rules in the 1st page or just make a different thread instead so that we can see consistency.   
  
Its just constructive criticism, don't mean to offend anyone.

@Pollen  
  
@swilliam  
  
Wanted to as you both about using the daily candle direction as confirmation. Trading on such a small timeframe using daily candle as direction seems pointless since lets say the daily candle can be 100 pips bullish and it can keep going down to turn red but you're still trying to buy as it goes down.   
  
Wouldn't a better alternative to use 4hr or 1hr as a filter?  
  
Just curious to see if you tried other alternatives and why daily is best.

@swilliam,  
  
Just wanted to make sure you see message above ^, really interested in your thoughts if 4hr could work better then daily. i noticed using daily as direction you miss lots of profitable trades, lets say daily candle has big wick up top and starting to move down but still bullish, you would miss sell trades. but with 4 hour you can catch them.

Pollen had severally said that it is not a free indicator. You can only buy it, so he is unable to share it

You can use the MA indicator to start. Using special trend indicators wont help if trendlines are not drawn correctly.  
After you familiarized the system, then you can change some indicators to your liking

Using daily candle in my point of view is a safer option. H4 candle can give too many trades per day. Better to find the best ones

Oh OK  
It is better to take them early?  
I will keep that in mind.  
  
Today seem not good, not too volatile.  
Or what's your opinion Sir?

its OK, but sometimes signals at the end of US ranges. So better to grab less than 10 pips in my opinion.  
That is not always the case, but you can test out

Happy new year everybody!  
  
Swilliam: thank you for thoughtfully sharing your system and keeping the two threads active and clean.   
  
Pollen: really appreciate your consistent posts showing visually what this system can do.   
  
I've reviewed at least 500 posts... Quick clarifying questions:

  1. Do you only trade in the direction of the daily candle? Is that the daily candle starting with the with Asian session open (a few hours after NY close)?
  2. Are you trading primarily London and NY? I have seen some Asian session trades too.
  3. Is there a time that you try to avoid? For example a lot of daily candles have long wicks that mean during the last parts of the NY session price went counter to the daily candle color. This means that trading in the direction of the daily candle would have a statistical disadvantage.
  4. How do you use the scanner? Do you look for MTF confirmation (e.g. on M15 and H1) or do you just focus on the M5?

1\. Yes, direction of the candle, mostly london session.  
2\. Yes, somtimes on Asia when i see a good setup and clear candle direction  
3\. Not filtering daily candles. I trade when there is a good trendline break and has space from s/r levels  
4\. Scanner not a part of the system. I just use it to check higher TF trends and confluence

Hey all,   
  
been lurking for a while but started testing this and I'm enjoying it...  
  
Q's  
\- How do you handle days like what we had yesterday? USD pairs spent about half the day fighting against the daily trend and there was quite a few fakeouts.  
\- How do you not overtrade with a strategy like this? I know its psychological but do you have set daily targets / limits to achieve?  
\- Has anyone had success with smaller TP/SL? (5pip TP, 3.5pip SL)  
\- Do you recommend just looking for pairs that are strong and weak or do you focus on a select few all the time?  
  
Many thanks - E

> Hey all, been lurking for a while but started testing this and I'm enjoying it... Q's - How do you handle days like what we had yesterday? USD pairs spent about half the day fighting against the daily trend and there was quite a few fakeouts. - How do you not overtrade with a strategy like this? I know its psychological but do you have set daily targets / limits to achieve? - Has anyone had success with smaller TP/SL? (5pip TP, 3.5pip SL) - Do you recommend just looking for pairs that are strong and weak or do you focus on a select few all the time?...

> Ignored

1\. fakeouts cannot be avoided. You will avoid most if you correctly draw trendlines and follow direction of daily candle on london  
2\. this only you can answer  
3\. too small, specially SL. Dont get caught in tight SL  
4\. No

the system can be downloaded on the start. You can also search the TMT scalping just uses other indicator with different version. This uses standard metatrader ones. The other uses histogram colored versions

Place indicators on MT4 folder, you use the standard MT4 indicators like RSI and MFI

Simple monday morning trade.  
  
I follow original rules. Difference is that i take partial at tp1, and trail until major S/R, in this case ADR.  
  
Go in a continuation trade aswell.

USDCAD 5M  
  
SL 1.5 ATR - TP1 1ATR  
  
Partial at 1 ATR, trail rest untill major S/R area, in this case higher ADR.  
  
  
And its last trade of the day, atm with 5.27% on the day, which i think its not bad for such a simple strategy.  
  
  
Have a nice day.

Well, i saw this really nice setup and couldn't go away without taking this trade.  
  
Rules are the same, and my rules aswell.  
  
SL 1.5ATR, TP1 1ATR.  
  
Forgot to say, trade at BE+1 pip for [spreads](https://www.forexfactory.com/brokers#spreads)+commissions, when hit TP1.  
  
Partial at 1ATR, trail rest until major S/R area, in this case lower ADR.  
  
  
USDCAD 5M  
  
Running risk free, trailing price. 6.77% for today and 1 trade running risk free.   
  
  
Have a nice day.

There is no trendline indicator included on the download. You can use any trendline indicator you like... Although most draw them on naked charts  
Hope that helps

using the mt4 fractals to drw the trendlines. the fractals draw after 3rd bar from high. the ones in MT4 repaint when high broken. Anyone has fractals that only draw on 3rd bar and dont repaint?

Hey Ajentha, good setup but since you have added an extra MA to your setup, I would suggest instead add only the 200 ma as a long trend guide(only) if you notice at the time of your entry the 200 was just below and the price action has been respecting the 200ma as support which would hold this trade as a short or wait for a break of the 200, also (as my own opinion) the mfi is rising near the cross (50) which added the 200ma in the way wouldn't take the trade.   
  
Just my humble input.  
  
Take care!

The best approach to SL and TP is support and resistance levels.  
If you are new, you can start with a constant value and adjust as needed.  
Try SL and TP around 10-20 pips depending on pair volatility and session.  
I usually set my TP around 7-10pips on Asia time and 10-12pips on London time.  
My SL, ranges from 10-20pips.

I dont think this system is good. I think no one can earn with that money management. You need 1:3 risk . You cant go 1:1 risk . I always using 1:3 or bigger 1:6. Try to think . If you are using 8 pips sl then you need 20 - 30 pips profit. Just do your best . Good luck

this depends. 1:1 is already good for scalping  
If you target 1:2 or more, scalping is not the system you need

i have question, the rules say for a daily candle sell position must be red and buy a daily candle must be green, my question is, the daily candle that we see only the candle that is running at that time, or the previous candle too? for example, when we want to sell, the previous 1 bar daily candle must also be red...? or it doesn't matter if we open a sell position when the daily candle goes red, but candle before it's green...?

My new version of the scanner retains the original strategy, but adds some filters. I won’t say what filter it is.  
After these days of testing, I personally think it is profitable.

Now that we have a basic trading system, the next step is to filter out bad signals, which is also the most important part. What I think of now is to filter out the signals with big move and the signals at the beginning of the moving average line crossed

The plan for this EA is the same as my other EAs on my website. You can use it for free, but you must update the code once a month.  
In fact, the signal of TMT Scanner is the same as the EA.  
I will update the TMT Scanner and add some filter conditions until it is profitable or give up....

If you used TMT Scanner yesterday, you should see this bad signal (1). I have filtered out this signal in the next version of TMT Scanner, but I will not release it until after the test on Monday.

TMT-Scanner is an indicator, not an EA, and no orders can be placed.  
If you want the TMT automated trading system, I will sort it out and it will be available on my website in a few days.

Use TMT-Scanner well, so that you can understand the advantages and disadvantages of this TMT system (strategy)?  
If everyone only uses EA to place orders, this system cannot be improved.

As a contribution, let me tell you that these results are due to trade against the real trend. Your Emas does not tell you the real trend. I use your great indicator with an EMA 200 or above. Good results.

Hi bp2000, great job and congratulations.  
  
To improve the quality of the signal, it would be useful for the indicator to leave the brakout signals in the history of chart.  
This thing would allow to understand with other indicators if the losing signals can be filtered  
  
Thanks

The big move filter does not seem to be very good, it will miss some good signals, and maybe need to be adjusted.

It's finally done.  
  
I have put RapidBot (EA) and TMT Trading System on my website.  
  
Note: Those who want to use EA to place orders, please pay attention, please read the content of the webpage carefully before downloading EA, do not rush to download and install it on the platform, thinking that you can make stable profits and make money.  
  
My website link is in the "About" tab of TMT-Scanner.ex4.

Actually there were a lot of USD currency pair signals yesterday, but there was a USD news release, and EA did not place an order (all are profitable).  
So should we use news filters?

TMT-Scanner 是 TMT-Scanner.  
RapidBot 是用相同的原理計算出信號，然後自動下單的EA.  
如果你想用手動下單，也想用EA自動下單，你需要打開二個Windows的。  
不然你只需要一个Windows.

Not in my opinion. And your results indicate it’s probably not a necessity.

on 14.05.2021 you show an operation for Buy of EUR / YPJ at a price of 132.534 at 07:45 and a hit stoploss at 09:45 at the level of 132.389. There is no such entrance on my Admiral's mt4 then. I guess others. I looked at the inputs to find out how to help increase the success of the system. And so I ask why there is an entrance into nothingness.

OK got it . In the picture you can see that I use a total of 4 EMAs. This is the system I'm working on. It covers in part  
and your system from which I receive an early signal with 1 candle. I use 7,21,84 and 336 EMA on M15. I use EMA21 as the axis of rotation for the moment. And the other EMAs are EMA21 on M5 = 7, M15 = 21, on H1 = 84 and on H4 = 336, When I see the trends of M5-EMA7 (3 five minute candles make 15 minutes EMA21 / 3 = EMA7), H1-EMA84 (21 on M15 x 4 candles = 60) and H4 -EMA336 (21X16- H4 = 16 15-minute candles and 21x16 = 336). And based on this picture I determine my daily direction of play. If they are useful to you, use them. And the picture below shows that for the day I have to eliminate all village signals and play only bye as it is with you for this day, but it is not always so because the current candle is a very short period for trend and saves you only the small stop moose. I eliminate it with supporting operations at a certain distance until the price closes a 15-minute candle <Ema336 and reverse the operation with lot = the sum of all closed operations + the initial lot (for the new operation). But this is another way out without a minus. It's off topic, so have a nice day

Could you test the inputs for the TP and SL using ATR period instead of 15pips. So TP could be 2 X ATR value, Stop could be 3 X ATR value. Might add more accuracy especially with the variants of each pair.

Hey @bp2000, Ive been using your scanner for couple of day and finding quite handy to track the pairs, got 2 queries for you though:  
  
1\. Alert button keeps switching to OFF when we swap pairs, does that happen to you also, could you check that?  
2\. I see you coded the EA for MT5 as well, any chance we could get the scanner for MT5 too? I am a M10 trader  
and find this Strategy to work better than 5/15 for more frequent and clearer signals.   
  
Thank you in advance and great work!!

1\. This is normal. If the alarm is not automatically turned off, you will be repeatedly notified when you switch to another currency pair.  
  
Solution: You can open two windows, one to install only the scanner, the other to install the trading system plus Symbol Changer, or you can also use the EA to receive notifications.  
  
2\. This will take some time.

The broker you use seems to be informal.  
The candlesticks of your H1 timeframe. It doesn't start with integers.  
It was 10 minutes late. Because your "Server GMT Offset" is +02:10  
  
2\. I don't know how much your funds are. Please try to change the lot size to 0.1 lot fixed.

你先不要修改参数，请先用TMT-SCanner，看看是否有T，A或B的信号。如果有信号，EA应该也有相同的信号才对。  
你正在修改的参数的意思是关於交易的启始时间，希望你能明白

Like the picture I attached, TMT-Scanner has two signals (B*), and these two signals can also appear on the EA's panel.

Each indicator or EA has an "About" tab, and the developer's contact information is usually contained in this tab.

You can select signal A or B,  
If you don't want signal B, just remove it from the list.  
Signal C and D, no use, just for reserve

To those who use EA without any trading orders:  
Please check the "**Experts** " tab first to see if there are any error messages.  
Is there a signal but no order? Or is there no signal at all? How long has there been no signal?  
Is the funding sufficient? What is the minimum lot size?  
Are there other EAs using the same Magic Number?  
Are there any changes to the EA settings?  
If it still doesn't work after the inspection, I suggest not to use EA. It is also good to use TMT-Scanner.

> To those who use EA without any trading orders: Please check the "Experts" tab first to see if there are any error messages. Is there a signal but no order? Or is there no signal at all? How long has there been no signal? Is the funding sufficient? What is the minimum lot size? Are there other EAs using the same Magic Number? Are there any changes to the EA settings? If it still doesn't work after the inspection, I suggest not to use EA. It is also good to use TMT-Scanner. {image} {image}

I am using default settings with trading enabled and 0.1 lot, no trades at all for the whole day, no error messages in logs, but maybe its related that my broker using suffix, so now I changed the pairs with suffix will see if this help. Will update you

Hi, what can I do to make the scanner work, can anyone advise me ??? At my broker, for example, EURUSD has a "+" suffix, so EURUSD + and maybe there is a problem here ?? Do you know how to fix it so that the scanner works?

Scanner has a bug.  
Scanner automatically detects the prefix and suffix.  
You cannot modify currency pairs in the current version (4.16).  
I will update it.

I had exactly same problem. No errors in expert log, but no trades. Added the suffix to EA pairs, and working fine now. I haven't updated to new version yet

I have always had the scanner signal A and B set to YES. I started to get trades immediately after adding the suffix to the EA.

Getting some nice trades tonight still using v10.01. I'll update later.  
Wondering what the Auto TP and SL based on ?ATR. Most of the trades I had would have made more pips past 15.

Thank you for this scanner.  
My problem is I don't get any alerts. And when I change the chart Alerts button turns to "OFF"  
What could be the problem?

I guess I got lucky.   
M5   
TP 15  
SL 15  
Maxorder 5  
  
The two losses below from just before NYO. First image AU B signal. Second image EU A signal.  
@ bp2000 Is it possible to try to filter the EU signal. That candle was 11 pips and almost 7 pips below the C line. The setup looked alright but the break was too far and a manual trader wouldn't have taken this trade.  
Does the AU look correct? I have my maxorders set to 5. If say the AU setup occurred, but I already had five orders open, then one closed. Would the AU then be initiated, but late?

seems like what other members told was true, bp2000 using this forum to sell his EA  
and you bought one with a license key on your screenshot.

If you want the Fxglow indicators, check the TMT Scalping System to download  
  
My system follows the Trend Line Scalping System Manual, but only replaced my trend filter to a better one in my experience  
You should use the moving average if you are a newbie here

Nobody here is discussing paid indicators. Showing charts with other added indicators are not a problem as different traders have different set of indicators to use, as long as you follow the main principle of Trendline Scalping System, Which is manual trading with price action analysis of setups.  
What is wrong is other members sharing unrelated systems like EA in efforts to get monetary donations from other members. THIS THREAD IS NOT A DONATION PROJECT. So i ignored them. Trolling on this thread is also not allowed.

Yes definitely .Actually for scalping 10 -20 pips with GU & GY pairs you dont need to even look at chart. Just look at the price the range,high low and round number.Thats it.

The trendline fast indicator repaints when you close and reopen the chart but the signals remain the same. Here is an example with the DAX.

Where do you get the day bar (candle on the right - MT4?) showing daily price direction? Is it a free indicator?  
Found this one: [https://www.mql5.com/en/market/produ...Profile+Seller](https://www.mql5.com/en/market/product/3808?source=Site+Profile+Seller) but it just shows a bunch of green all over the chart (and no candle).

Every MA crosing based System works in a solid Trend. SO yuo have to do more than simply follow the indicators.  
Watching highs and lows to avoid being catched in a Range or consolidation  
If in a Trend this System works fine and it is very easy to use

Do you enter as soon as the break candle closes, or wait till price break the top/bottom of that candle?

Scalping dax with tmt works, but mabee it's not such a good idee using tfs like m1 or m5  
DAX Spikes 7 pips and then a fast backmove taken out you SL if to tight. This happens in volatil Times again and again.   
So the Most dificult Part of your trading is the handling of the stoplosses. If to tight or Set to break even to early, you can not gainn 10 or more pips, yuo must be satisfied with 5 pips. So next month I go back to Forex Eurusd or cable like I dit Before. I feel much more save trading forex..  
But that is me, everybody has to do what suits best for him

These are great setups. Was the EJ sell based on the 4H?

quite right, H4 showed the start of the setup, then zoom in with lower TF (H1, M30, M15..) and M5 was the trigger on a pullback, the exit was on the first RSI reversal. If I zoomed out to higher TF I could have stayed a bit longer, but it doesn't matter, maybe next time I will confirm with higher TF.

do you look for the same pullback setup on the H4 as the M5? also, why do you prefer H4 over D1?

I would if my setup TF is D1, then my pullback would be a lower TF like H4 or H1. H4 presents more opportunities than D1.

Do you use SR on the higher time frames? I was planning on following the first post, trade in the direction of the daily candle and trade the pullbacks on M5 but use H1 for SR.

SR are useful for entry points of price rejection on resistance or bounce off support and also for target projection. I use PVSRA or SonicR Access panel which provide all what I need, you can choose which type of SR you want to display.

No, I'm still using M5 but this chart illustrates what I said earlier.

1\. check direction of d1 candle  
2\. look for entry points on h1/h4 based on trend direction and SR  
3\. look for trades on m5  
  
Am I understanding correctly?

yes, check direction of D1,  
wait for setups on H4 in the same direction,  
zoom down to H1 and check the RSI changing color, (I'm using the histogram but you can use the original above /below 50) if price already ahead of you don't run after it, zoom further down until you get a better entry on a pullback.  
once you place your trade and SL plan your exit on a near by S/R or on the next change in RSI color (if you got out too soon it's ok, you can wait for re-entry on the next change in color provided the trend is still valid) if you see more than three pullbacks on the M5 be very careful of a reversal, zoom back up and see what's happening, look at the daily wick, is it getting longer.... I keep the H4 and D1 candles on the same chart (you can get the last three candles by applying Anycandlegroup.mq4 twice and choose the H4 and D for TF and shift them apart to get adequate space between them).  
I think its very important NOT to take all setups, and trade in high volatility sessions like London start or NY start. Exit at London close if price is going no where and your target is not reached.  
I also find ForextrenHero very useful in watching for new setups on different TF, you can choose 4 different TF.

Guys, when u look at the D1 Candle do u pay attention to size and shape of the candle( for example hammer or shooting star) or only RED or GREEN for Sell or Buy ?

The D1 candle is a dynamic price action in progress, unless you’re talking about the previous day candle which is already set and closed. Take a look at the D candle below, at the open and until the NY open it was red, then after NY open it reversed. So before that you would have taken sell trades if the RSI was below 50, I took two sell trades, then after that the candle became green and RSI was above 50 so I took a long trade exited when the rsi histo changed color. By that time the D candle started to have a longer upper wick and there was an opportunity to take a short trade but I did not take it coz too close to LC.

it looks like most of your trades are reversals after the MAs cross back over into the direction of the daily candle rather than pull backs into an ongoing trend. is this a different type of entry than the entry in the first post?  
  
I missed the trade in the attached image today as I am also working but it looks like a good example of the type of pull back we are looking for, though the MFI is not ideal at the time of the break.

How is it different if I'm taking my trades in the same direction of the daily candle, do you think that D1 starts red and stays red all the time? or vice versa? sometimes like the example I showed it starts red and the trades were short, then it turned green and so what am I supposed to do? wait for it to become red again? I'm not looking at higher TF to see what the trend is, if the trend is up or down for several days in a row then yes I would ride the trend and enter on pullbacks, but days like this one you have mini trends which you can ride and also enter on pullbacks.  
In the example that you showed, the daily candle was green at the open all the way until 1 hour after NY open, then it turned red, and you have your 3 pullbacks, one before and two after![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f600.png?v=15.1)  
I find the MFI is misleading sometimes, that's why I combined the RSI and MFI in one histo by adding the RSI on top of the MFI, much cleaner signal in and out, but that's me.  
  
PS: I find 6 opportunities in today's range not just 3

Thank you so much.  
What about pair selection, when u see FAT candle on EURUSD as example do u stay in that pair for the rest of the day if all day green candle will stay or u look for more pair and trade multiply pair in the same time. Im trying to get myself discipline, need advise please ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Not sure what you mean by FAT, but yes if the trend remains valid then I will stay in. I've yet to find a good exit indicator that will not take me out prematurely. Most of the time if the RSI indicates exit and the trend still valid then re-entry on pullback is few candles away.  
I try to concentrate on one or two pairs, I do not trade all day and try to look for setups around LO or NYO.

quick one. i did also lose one earlier, though.   
  
it does seem like london open has the best trade opportunities, at least on the few pairs i follow.

For your last GU sell, my indicator did not show a red bar yet. Based on the MFI, it's not below the 50 line. But on yours it's red. How are you calculating the RSI and MFI?

I am using the RSI and MFI bar, overlaid on top of each othe in one window. If you do that you will find that the RSI overpowers the MFI bar which I find useful and less confusing.

If that's the case, then the MFI isn't really being used.

I think so, yes, I just kept is because I did not do any testing without it and did not want to change the original recommendations from the creator.  
  
  
PS: I just checked the settings of my MFI and found that the default is 15 not 14, try it and see if it will show red for you too.  
The RSI default is 7 not 8, I did not not change them from whoever uploaded them so I assumed they're the same.

I changed MFI to 15 and now it's red. Interesting

problem solved? you also need to change the RSI to 7 not 8. Whoever changed those settings must have done some testing and found the right settings.

I don't want to change the system yet as I'm still learning and I may be missing something but it seems as though MFI is unnecessary. I will likely remove it in the future if I do not see a use for it but I'm keeping it as I gain experience. I've made one trade today and MFI was not in confluence – see attached image.

Entry on the break. I started trading M15 instead of M5 and I'm having more success. Trying SL 20 pips and TP 20 pips on M15.

Just two days but I've only been trading this system for about one business week so it's probably not best to base anything on my trades.   
  
I made another trade on the GBPUSD for 8 or 9 pips only. Wasn't really a trade based on the system, price was just leaving the pullback zone. I sold once price started ranging after a few bars.

I agree, I have not found the MFI useful myself and that's why I combined the RSI and MFI in one window. I find M5 TF to be more accurate for entry as it can show you a retrace for a better price, and since you already set your SL and profit then the exit TF will not matter.

I've been monitoring the thread "1 Minute Pullback System" which has been very popular on FF these days. After analyzing that I applied those concepts to this system in a different way. Ultimately I came to the conclusion that in an ever expanding and contracting market, mean reversion is a very strong concept.  
  
This is my interpretation of this system. Context - I like to scalp volatile indices on short time frames so I usually exit after a bar or two of profit.  
  
The indicator that I'm using to identify the trend is called Half-Trend, it's a very popular and widely used indicator. The logic I'm applying to the system is along the lines of some kind of mean reversion. Essentially, if price has moved "really"(subjective) far from the Half-Trend and Half-Trend has not changed color(trend) then I'm assuming price will pull back to it's mean. I'm using the tried-and-true MACD as an extra layer of validation and confirmation. I'm only entering when the MACD shows weakness and price is relatively far from the Half Trend. We could also use volume in confluence with both indicators for even further filtering.  
  
For the time being this system proves to be very accurate, however I just started back testing today and will do some small forward testing tomorrow.  
  
some examples exemplifying my reasoning

Hey peachblast, nice scalping you got there, I believe entries here are with the trend (the 7 & 20 EMA) which is the essence of this thread "Trendline Scalping System" (please refer to the first page for more details). Trades are initiated upon break of the trendline and upon continuation after pullback towards the line, however I think you are doing counter trend entries or am I mistaken?. Please state your entries clearly i.e what are your conditions for long and short entries using the indicators you mentioned.  
  
Regards LB

Hope all is well  
  
Are you using the standard macd correct? Not mt4  
  
Are you find it better entries with the macd and rsi. It has been mentioned that mfi does not provide any edge I agree

What is here the clear rule for that trendline?  
For me I can not see that line you post at that place. Trade is working that is not the point. Can you define a routine for drawing your lines?  
  
Thanks. 

Market is more simple as you think.

connecting highs to form a trendline for buy  
  
connecting lows for a trendline for sell.  
  
its a bit subjective but i use small trendlines for scalping. Big trendlines are for main trend

hi, i just trying to create my EA. I cannot create new threads so, sorry for me to post my question here.   
i create a grid ea. It can work on the stratetry tester. But when i run on realtime, it cannot place order.   
My script to calculate value:   

Inserted Code
    
    
    void CalculateTradeParameters() {
        double grid_range = NormalizeDouble(MarketInfo(Symbol(), MODE_BID) * GridPercentage / 100 / 10 * 100 * _Point, Digits);
        double start_sell_price = MarketInfo(Symbol(), MODE_BID);
        double start_buy_price = MarketInfo(Symbol(), MODE_ASK);
        S1 = NormalizeDouble(start_sell_price + 1 * grid_range * _Point * 100, Digits);
        S2 = NormalizeDouble(start_sell_price + 2 * grid_range * _Point * 100, Digits);
        TP_S1 = NormalizeDouble(start_sell_price + (1 - 1) * grid_range*0.99 * _Point * 100, Digits);
        TP_S2 = NormalizeDouble(start_sell_price + (2 - 1) * grid_range*0.99 * _Point * 100, Digits);
    
        B1 = NormalizeDouble(start_buy_price - 1 * grid_range * _Point * 100, Digits);
        B2 = NormalizeDouble(start_buy_price - 2 * grid_range * _Point * 100, Digits);
        TP_B1 = NormalizeDouble(start_buy_price - (1 - 1) * grid_range*1.01 * _Point * 100, Digits);
        TP_B2 = NormalizeDouble(start_buy_price - (2 - 1) * grid_range*1.01 * _Point * 100, Digits);

My Place order:  

Inserted Code
    
    
    void PlaceTradeOrders() {
        stopLevel = NormalizeDouble(MarketInfo(_Symbol, MODE_STOPLEVEL) * Point, Digits);
        
        
        if (signal=="start") {
            // Place Buy Orders
            if (!DoesOrderExistWithComment("B1")) {
                  RefreshRates();
                if (TP_B1-B1<=stopLevel)
                OrderSend(_Symbol, OP_BUYLIMIT, 1*Lots, B1, slippage, 0, TP_B1 + stopLevel, "B1", MagicNumber, 0, Red);
                else OrderSend(_Symbol, OP_BUYLIMIT, 1*Lots, B1, slippage, 0, TP_B1, "B1", MagicNumber, 0, Red);
            }  
            if (!DoesOrderExistWithComment("B2")) {
                  RefreshRates();
                if (TP_B2-B2<=stopLevel)            
                OrderSend(_Symbol, OP_BUYLIMIT, 2*Lots, B2, slippage, 0, TP_B2 + stopLevel, "B2", MagicNumber, 0, Red);
                else OrderSend(_Symbol, OP_BUYLIMIT, 2*Lots, B2, slippage, 0, TP_B2, "B2", MagicNumber, 0, Red);
            }  
           
        if (signal=="start" ) {   
            // Place Sell Orders
            if (!DoesOrderExistWithComment("S1")) {
                  RefreshRates();
                if (S1-TP_S1<=stopLevel)
                OrderSend(_Symbol, OP_SELLLIMIT, 1*Lots, S1, slippage, 0, TP_S1 - stopLevel, "S1", MagicNumber, 0, Blue);
                else OrderSend(_Symbol, OP_SELLLIMIT, 1*Lots, S1, slippage, 0, TP_S1, "S1", MagicNumber, 0, Blue);
            }  
            if (!DoesOrderExistWithComment("S2")) {      RefreshRates();
                if (S2-TP_S2<=stopLevel)
                OrderSend(_Symbol, OP_SELLLIMIT, 2*Lots, S2, slippage, 0, TP_S2 - stopLevel, "S2", MagicNumber, 0, Blue);
                else OrderSend(_Symbol, OP_SELLLIMIT, 2*Lots, S2, slippage, 0, TP_S2, "S2", MagicNumber, 0, Blue);
            }

  
I can run this script in stratetry tester. But in realtime, it cannot place order with this error:  
2023.08.30 16:50:52.799 '2102522041': order buy limit 0.40 BTCUSD opening at 26791.39 sl: 0.00 tp: 26915.13 failed [Trade is disabled]

I tried to another broker then get this error: Invalid TP or SL   
Please help me. Many thanks

Love the simplicity of this system!   
  
Here's my input:  
Add MA Sabres by LuxAlgo (Free TradingView indicator) - The "MA Sabres" indicator highlights potential trend reversals based on a moving average direction. Detected reversals are accompanied by an extrapolated "Sabre" looking shape that can be used as support/resistance and as a source of breakouts.  
The indicator will look for a change in direction after the MA went in the same direction during x consecutive bars (settings: "_Reversal after x bars in the same direction_ "). Then a circle-shaped drawing will be drawn 1 bar back, at the previous high/low, dependable of the previous direction. From there originates a sabre-shaped figure where the tip lies as far as the user-set MA length.  
  
Some of the founding fathers of this system, used indicators which was a representation of the mean of two MA's, like, TrendMagic, or HalfTrend.   
I Found using HalfTrend, is better than an arbitrary "pullback". If HalfTrend is bullish, then one could equate this to price being above a set of MAs. (similar to 9, and 20) If a frowning sabre is produced WHILE the halftrend is bullish, AND price crosses it, this would trigger the entry. (see screen print)

Hi Team,   
  
I am new to this strategy.   
  
I am just wondering how do I know when to enter my trade, is it when the line cross the trendline or do we need to wait for EMA?  
  
Also for profit is there any range we take like 1:2 and how do we determine SL and TP?  
  
Thanks again

Hello Bramking08.  
  
In the first post you have all the necessary info to answer your questions. My recommendation is that you read the entire thread. Reading every page of this thread isn't a waste of time but an investment.

> Hi Team, I am new to this strategy. I am just wondering how do I know when to enter my trade, is it when the line cross the trendline or do we need to wait for EMA? Also for profit is there any range we take like 1:2 and how do we determine SL and TP? Thanks again

all setups need to conform on the bar close, but the trend line break anytime on the current bar. the previous bar mus satisfy all the conditions before the break.  
Risk reward is dynamic, no such thing as 1:2 all the time. Start with 1:1 and feel free to adjust.

Hi guys, I'm just starting to use this system (my first time doing intraday trading of any sort!) really like it for its simplicity, just one question; when you're drawing your trendline from the 'most recent swing high', how far back do you tend to look for this swing high? I read earlier in the thread that drawing the trendline is left up to the individual's discretion but I'm just looking for a gauge on what other users are doing. I personally have been looking for the recent swing high since the 7EMA last crossed over the 20EMA, which in choppier markets can sometimes be quite recently and lead to a very steep trendline. Let me know if you've got any tips, cheers and happy scalping!

it depends, you will get a feel of it as you get used to the system. The drawing depends how the trendline looks. But in terms of how many bars back. I usually limit to 20 bars.

These trend lines are so subjective, can hardly call this a system as the trend lines which are integral to the system can’t not be replicated trade to trade

Here's my input: Add MA Sabres by LuxAlgo (Free TradingView indicator) - The "MA Sabres" indicator highlights potential trend reversals based on a moving average direction. Detected reversals are accompanied by an extrapolated "Sabre" looking shape that can be used as support/resistance and as a source of breakouts. The indicator will look for a change in direction after the MA went in the same direction during x consecutive bars (settings: "Reversal after x bars in the same direction"). Then a circle-shaped drawing...

That makes sense, cheers. I'm trying to get 100 trades with the system in a demo account under my belt before I take it to a live account. I am starting to get a feel for the lines though, like you said. Happy scalping!

I have a trendline and a resistance level that tells me sell GU is more likely.

History shows that it got up, so yes, it is easy for me to say.  
  
But you MA's were in the process of ordering nicely, so that would be an up signal. And a resistance is not necessarily the same as a bounce.

yes, in the bigger picture, glad there was no signal to buy.

Thank you for sharing your strategy. I wrote a MT5 version of TMT - Daily Candle indicator. I hope it can help people who use MT5.

This is very useful. Thank you.   
  
I would ask though.....Is it possible to add maybe 1 or 2 candles for the previous days. ?  
I have overlay candles but they make the charts too messy....

Swilliam is the Trendline scalping strategy still working? I am doing a full week testing and if i see something that is good to chanage i will post here. So far from my backtest the results are amazing! You can easly make between 1-2% a day ONLY if market structure allows it and have the patience to take 10-15 trades a day! Plus on 1min TF

ATR Based Trendlines (TradingView)  
This script draws trendlines from the pivot points in the price chart.  
  
The angle of the trendlines is determined by (a percentage of) the atr.  
  
The angle follows the change in price, dictated by the atr at the moment where the pivot point is detected.  
  
The atr percentage determines if the trendline follows the rate of change of the atr or a fraction ( value < 100) or a multiple ( value > 100) of that

Hi there!  
I am a new guy for this strategy, it looks like that setup on EURUSD was not formed?

I am pretty sure it is. I use very similar approach. I just put RoundNumbers levels and don't trade if the price is about to reach it.

This system works well. The trend lines are quite arbitrary but the concept is very solid.  
  
I'm really enjoying the daily candle and oscillator synergy. I also have been enjoying the simple 8-10 pip fixed TP/SL.  
  
For a buy I use; Price is above the daily open, Oscillators are above 50, and a simple trend line is broken. Fixed 1:1  
  
Currently 6W 1L, cheers

Which Oscillator are you talking about Machine?  
  
Sorry, I should read the whole thread as I normally does, but it is very long.
