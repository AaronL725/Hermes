Today i am sharing one old post /analysis by ATA ..i think it is really informative and good to learn  
shark pattern rules and nice clear analysis  
[https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...6#post10054306](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=10054306#post10054306)  
  
  
SHARK PATTERN ANALYIS BY ATA  
**EURUSD Weekly Analysis**  
  
The weekly chart is currently slowing PA down because we are at the potential C leg of a Shark Pattern. (Additionally if you look left to past candles you will see what was support earlier becomes resistance now).  
  
The current weekly candle actually pierced a little higher through that level **1.0873** but did not close above it yet which leaves the Shark pattern still in play.  
  
Another nearby pattern is the AB=CD pattern waiting at 1.0984 but since there are 100 pips inbetween I prefer to rely on the shark pattern and look for sell opportunities on smaller timeframes.  
  
I am looking for sell opportunities with tight SL and if 1.09-1.0915 zone breaks then bulls might have a final run limited with 100-120 pips.  
  
My conclusion is that somewhere inside these 100-120 pips the paused weekly bearish trend will continue to complete any of these patterns. Especially the shark pattern can push price at least down to D point: 1.0236 and even lower to its maximum range to D-max: 0.998

**Take note of individual days of the week. This is usually how a week goes:**  
**Monday – investors get back to work and perform initial analysis (possible low dynamics).**  
**Tuesday – an exchange of information between banks and investors gets underway, movement becomes more dynamic.**  
**Wednesday – the market has settled for a direction and follows it.**  
**Thursday – movement reaches its maximum level, everyone attempts to join it.**  
**Friday – profit realization and partial position closure before the weekend (possible sudden and unpredictable movements).**  
**(collected)**

so you are supposed to take shorts when price reaches the 78.6 fib retracement...I like this fib very much and have been using it in some of my trades, but on g/u I had taken the entries way before this fib...I guess I got lucky..anyway,we do what work for ourselves..

Hi classy,  
  
attached are 3 sets of scripts which will draw those fib nodes when drop onto your chart.  
  
each script to draw the new fib nodes with unique ID and will delete old ones.  
  
why 3 sets? I think you would normally need to draw 3 fib nodes for those harmonics patterns, right?   
  
try them and let me know if these are correct.  
  
PM me if you want the mq4 source files.   
  
kind regards,

> Hi classy, attached are 3 sets of scripts which will draw those fib nodes when drop onto your chart. each script to draw the new fib nodes with unique ID and will delete old ones. why 3 sets? I think you would normally need to draw 3 fib nodes for those harmonics patterns, right? try them and let me know if these are correct. PM me if you want the mq4 source files. kind regards, {file} {file} {file}

Sure will do, i had started completely from zero when it comes to these types of indicators  
I always trades **Auto** or **Pivot** , but it is good to see your success with it and hopefully  
i will learn more _ as soon as i get settled and confident with Harmonic will share trades OK ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/270c-fe0f.png?v=15.1)

Nice one mate !   
I am practicing and find the different indicators sometime match signals   
and some other times they don't on the same time frame   
Here on Usd Jpy i have compared the zup v135All and the 150   
.. i am getting used and feel better to start drawing these Fib entrancement lines manually Abcd

Hello Classy,  
  
I've just started reading "Trade what you see" by Larry Pesavento & Leslie Jouflas and came across your thread here. Learning Harmonics can be quiet overwhelming...  
Anyway I hope to participate here in the future if you do not mind. Also I am a little lost with regards to the Fib Retracement tool and how you got the Extension numbers above zero in post #211. I tried many combinations and only managed to get the E113.0 @ -0.113. Could you please shed some light on the matter?  
  
Thank you very much man!

HI Classy the zup tool i downloaded from here kindly shared by you   
it is working finely and i am still experimenting with it   
and i have seen it is much better and reassuring to double check on chart   
with the fibo retracements from XA/AB_ ... each leg one by one ...   
Thanx for the advise ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44c.png?v=15.1)

The arriving better than the arrival, the journey has just started

nice jen it is the only way to trade harmonic pattern(confirm manually with fibo)you use indicators just to see pattern than confirmed than trade according to your own trading set up ..looking forward to see your actions ....soon.we need participation ,sharing for long lasting thread ...................

Classy, I like your evaluation of USDCHF. I'm watching this too for a long entry. I Was looking for a drop to 0.94275 but just missed as the last 4 hour candle didn't quite make it. I will wait now till open Sydney and have another look.

s you can see here are areas that have been rejected  
on the right the 3-series typically for purchase  
to the blue-embossed these are all val of november 2017  
that is the volume will be more it will take  
until the ranges 133.70-134.00 are met  
long term long  
best buy would be 131.20-131.68

Use pz in h1 and h4  
mp multi m30

Look this image, the candle high is 7 candle behind and the candle low 16. I change the name of the line to "Classy", change the color, change the timeframe, text distance. with this lines you can find the % ratio of any point in your chart.

With the Type_Lines= true, you can use as 1 pivot levels starting from the open week in this case, put the same timeframe for the 3 lines and change the values of ratios and the name of lines.

I think, this other indi will be useful for you know how much percent the price is going from the top or bottom.  
  
High lines = true, show the lines from the top.  
  
High lines = false, show the lines from the bottom.  
\-----------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
EURUSD - Weekly - Starting from the top - High lines = true

The current candle is the value=0, look your image, so you have in your image the LastCandle1_High = 3, and the LastCandle1_Low = 1. Change for this values and you will see the 50% as you want. While you leave the value of the LastCandle1_High=4 and LastCandle1_Low=4, the indi not will change the position of the line.  
  
I posted another indicator above, and it will help you to find the LastCandle_High and LastCandle_Low.

You want something like an box, and ion this case you need to use the indicator from the candle open , put the same timeframe for the lines and change the % ratio.

Coded for classy - see the brief video below as it shows how the indicator works as it has a drag and drop feature which makes it able to be set to any number of candles on any timeframe, if you want to show a certain timeframe for a set of lines use the "Timeframe Label " input to set the TF label on the lines. The number of Bars/Candles back is displayed at the 0.00 line.  
  
NOTE IMPORTANT :  
1/ The name of the indicator cannot be changed or it will not work.  
2/ A password must be used - password = **FREE_FF_indicator**

cja ,please correct me if i am doing anything wrong ? here is high to low drag 7 bar but showing/counting 4 bar so i am confuse about 50% ?  
is it 50% of 7 bar or 4 bar ?  
if it is possible and not bother you too much than default high to low any time frame before drag set 6 bars or last swing high to low .

If you set the High to Low on a M30 chart at 10/7 candles then change to a H1 chart the candle count then becomes 5/4 if you go to a M15 chart the bar count becomes 20/14, to avoid confusion on what timeframe you are looking at use the "Timeframe Label " input and it will show which timeframe you set the high/low on regardless of which timeframe you display on the chart. See below screenshots with High/Low originally set on H1. The default bars back is set to 10 bars/candles.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

cja master, many many thanks for your time and explain. my humble request is it possible to change default bar number 6 or last swing high-low for any time frame or pair i change .i know you are busy and already you create an awesome indicator/tool for me so if it too much bothering to modify just ignore my request.

sorry for delay ,this is not order book .i called it order block .it is difficult to express in 1/2 words.i show only ptz(potental trading zone/level/key area but not traditional so called support/resistance /trends...etc i search /show in my way)i use price actions+patterns+fib ratios +mt4 tools like Andrew pitchfork ,equidistant channel (not all this for every pair )hope it helps.

1/ **pair change indicator** What is this indicator???  
2/ **i can't create any template** You cannot make a template of this indicator if you think about it then it becomes very obvious.

When the indicator is dragged onto a chart it sets the levels based on the high low for that Symbol of course if you drag another Symbol/chart onto that existing chart then the price range is going to be completely different, for example set the indicator up on the EURUSD chart and lets say for the sake of simplicity the high= 1.18000 and the Low = 1.17000 then drag the GBPUSD chart onto the EUR chart changing it to a GBPUSD chart, compress the chart and you will see the indicator set to the 1.18000/1.17000 levels on the GBPUSD chart. This is the problem when people do not give all the information when requesting an indicator, at no point did you ever explain how you were attempting to use this indicator so your method of use was never considered when the indicator was coded. When a coder asks for ALL the INFORMATION they mean ALL! This may come as a surprise but I cannot read your mind!!!![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)  
The only way around it with this indicator is to save it as a **set file** and load that set file for each different chart.

Hi classy,  
As I have said previously I encourage you to ask questions, this latest problem has made me think ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1) and I have coded a script which you can use to reset the indicator for each new chart, the only issue is that the script will delete any other trend lines on the chart but has the advantage that it will work if several  
Numbered Candle Breakout indicators are loaded on the same chart regardless of the different magic numbers.  
You can either drag the script out of the navigator window onto the new chart or setup a hot key ( I think a hot key is quickest ) and the script will reset the indicator onto the new chart with the previous indicator settings intact. To setup a hot key **right click the script** in the list and select **Set hotkey** then choose the control of **ctrl or alt** and then choose the key which is **any letter** off your keyboard.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

This script works **without deleting trend lines** but will only work if the indicator is loaded on the chart with the**default magic number "12345"** but this is probably the best option if only one Numbered Candle Breakout indicator is used and loaded on a chart.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Please note these scripts are to refresh the Numbered Candle Breakout indicator so it resets to the new pair price levels when a new pair chart is dragged onto an existing chart from the navigator window.

Do you mean that you want to be able to remove or show ALL the labels??? One input ON/OFF???![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
You cannot have looked at the indicator very hard it already has that input.

I am really interested in the way you analyse those charts. I also really admire your passion.  
I am just a newbie, and on my way looking for "holy grail" in trading. Will follow this thread. I will try to post my analysis in case I feel more confident.

Could you share your experience about how to define pattern quickly, please?   
For me, it's quite difficult to recognize the pattern...

IT IS Difficult to teach because it need a lot of practice and back test.you prepare or train your self to read chart/patterns at a glance and i think it is possible when you give effort/time and practice.

Thanks for good questions and interest to learn.currency correlation and intra market or macro economy is huge subject ,it is so difficult to understand 2/3 sentence. 1st of all you should learn "currency correlation" and "intra market relation or impact "on "macro economy".you just search Google or you tube you will find a lot of videos and all information.  
For your convenience i used "" for keyword or search ..thanks

Hi there, I am a little confused on the difference between futures and current spot rates on the 10-yr treasury. Are these simply inversely related bond prices to yields that you have posted? I am using this to better understand USD forex spot rates so any help is appreciated. I have never seen any treasury charts before. What platform do you view them on? Last question I promise, why is the 10-yr such a valuable tool in determining future rates over other time-frame based bonds? Is it a human subconscious phenomenon or simply a good predictor in relation to short term bonds based on the yield curve? Thanks for the insight!

welcome ,many many thanks for visit and interest about my post.in short 10 yrs bond yield and bond correlations is reverse (normally but some time we see divergence or anomaly)if yield rate increase than we see udx or dollar index rise or bullish and when usdx bullish than currency ,gold price decrease or bearish.i check all this pair index ,stocks,bund to understand liquidity i mean where is money in or out .i think intra market correlations is so important for trading.all links are given 1st page.i hope it helps. please keep visit and share your trading analysis,idea/stg too.thanks again.

tpo = how often a price was traded  
vpo = VOLUMEN I do not know if it is real, there is one direction  
H4 the smallest value shows buying interest from below  
the same is from the top selling interest  
can the lines on the left show you where you are in the moment

hi pips mate nice see you share your experience too.....i tried to match with smart money who are like big/monster chu force so i tried to spot trap like sun tzu with my orderblock /smart money understanding .sun tzu said avoid strong and attack weak so before any trade decision i check currency strength weakness ,correlations and cot and volume spread analysis (my way).sun tzu always entice and i see 100/1000 times smart money entice retail trader/herd before move .sun tzu said all warfare is deceive and smart money always deceive/traped herd. in my trading and life suntzus impact a lot.sun tzu said be like your enemy so i want think ,plan.like smart money who move /controlled Forex market. sun ztu, philosophy,courage,planning,strategy ,idea,concept,perceptions is outstanding extra ordinary after 2500 years applicable in forex trading,business ,war,sports and individuals life.

Sun tzu Said "If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle."  
  
In a **trading** context: If you know the **market** and know yourself, you will consistently profit  
In My PTZ We Follow Smart Money And order block  
  
Sun Tzu Said"  
He who knows when he can fight, and when he cannot, will be victorious.  
In My PTz Some time no Trading is Good Trading.  
Sun Tzu said All war is based on deception.  
In My PTZ We believe Smart money always deceive us(retail traders)

Eur Aud Top-Down PTZ. some friends asked me to describe how i analyze my ptz. let's get started.  
Let's start with month ptz. we can a line which is our main focus .now we will try to more clear ptz  
in weekly ptz we can see some buy pressure in current candle /price(we always focus on current price/ptz/smart money's movement)  
For clear ptz we can zoom in/out our chart.  
In Daily PTz we used Fibonacci here .some time use equidistance channel ED /harmonic pattern/can/chart pattern /fibo fan(i mean wee need to confirm, to go buy or sell evidence) can see more clearly our buy ptz or sell ptz to take our trading decision. Now we know we should go for short.  
we can check 4h/1h ptz for our set up/ptz too .If you have any questions, please let me know. Share your views too.  
This my top-down process.we can follow this step to analyze any pair/index/metal any time frame.

Nice setup with the USDCAD.   
  
But with oil still falling and USD being strong is it wise to short it? Won't it be better for it to take out the psychological level of 1.40 and then short it on the retest of 1.40?

Hello Classy  
  
I have noticed that you are having trouble on another thread regarding an expert/indicator that shows the High[1] or something I have an expert that does something like that, if you could include a drawing or a screen shot of what you want I will see if mine can help maybe change a few things to my expert to do what you want... No promises as I am not a coder I just screw around with code to see what I can do.'  
  
OK! If I can help I will try.  
  
Cheers  
Rod

This is what I have.  
  
I'll attach the ex4 file if is any good as it is I'll email you the mq4 file as people tend to grab file and screw with them.  
Maybe I could massage it a bit to fit your needs.  
  
Let me know.

What is PTZ?  
My Trading Strategy based on smart money but i use a lots of weapons to catch smart moves, tricks, manipulation,trapped,buy-sell liquidity, false ,deceive stop run , break out,fake out which i mixed and synchronize with , My creation, My creation, My PTZ, in my way.To Deal with smart money ,bank ,instititute properly you should focus on supply demand specially Wyckoff method ,accumulation ,re-accumulation, Distribution .re-distribution , schematic rules . i believe combination of supply demand Wyckoff method smart money concept work like a charm. If it is possible than learn some buy-sell patterns like Quasimodo ,Flag limit, SR ,flip,3 drive, cap ,engulf ,decision point dp, Fail to return FTR , First time back FTB, Compression etc than it will be superb.

hi classy  
  
You are welcome always.  
  
Sorry this will take some time as I am busy this week to setup new server hardware to be re-located datacenter. It will take a few more days till this weekend to get all the testing done and verified.  
  
But so far, I manage this below:  
  
1) to show the previous D1 hi-lo with 50% (indicator)   
  
2) to show previous Week high-low (indicator)  
  
3) a script to manual plot the Fib 50% on any selected swing.

Hi Classy, I recently came across the numbered candle breakout indicator that you took your precious time to get coded, I use order locks and market structure but I am in desperate need of an indicator that can plot out the zones for me with and I was going to go through the stress of getting it coded but I trust @Cja came up with excellent codes for it, I tried to load it on my charts but it required a password so I figured you are the first person I can ask if you can kindly share it with me ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f64f.png?v=15.1)  
,,Many many thanks in installment.

thank you.  
  
I seems to start to retrace, but some force still push it up strong ly, large range candle on low volume pull it back and higher, it does not make sense, Oil price can not stay high like this for long, so why UC going weak and CAD so strong  
  
If retracement, you talk from H4, D1 or only H1? Before it could "go higher..." ??? How much sure are you with higher?

no worry classy.  
I try to understand the reason impossible GJ keep getting higher why the reality in UK economy is not so impeccable. Food shortage, ppl suffers ... before switch to price action and join the buyers what I do not like is buy at_the_top price, without a proper retracement, and creeping up on very thin volume is there something in techn. analysis I missed which explains the going up, or it is a trap?  
  
Personally fundamental there could be a reason came across some mysterious big traders other financial sites, appeared shortly seemed not to care the loss when GBP going down and kept warning not short on GBP as it would be great, break all limit big about this Xmast, they kept long multi lots like 25 lots bragging ... Why Big at Xmast? win a euro million lottery or what. Those words lingered in my mind

look how smart money create illusion, manipulation, deceive, trap and tricks us before start original move. Check your 1hour chart and ask your self gold buy or sell? this chart was posted my friend titu reza in facebook last evening when gold was stalling and collecting liquidity from weak hand creating illusion, tarp.

OMG, this is very interesting ... Do not know that you created this thread for more than 4 years now ???  
I like your stuffs in this thread, like : Pattern (harmonics), TZ, Subply & demand, etc ... Market of forex, stocks, gold, bonds, crypto etc, all are uncertain ... but i believe there is some thing we can get from the history like : Foot print, Structure, and so on, if i am not wrong.... i hope i can learn new stuffs here to improve my trading ability, because i am always loooossssss until now ... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1) may be this is not my world to get some money (my character is not good for doing this ?? ... i do not know...) , but i will give myself a last chance, before i really quit , as so many people said that i am just wasting my time on this.... ??? still trying to grasp some thing here and there if possible for this last try ... hopefully can see some light soon ...  
Have a nice day

Hi Classy,  
any idea on this ? [https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...t-way-to-trade](https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/402253-ratios-harmonics-a-different-way-to-trade)  
i read it some time ago, and i think mr pip makes some small optimized (?) rule of his harmonic pattern.  
i don't know how to calculate the pattern exactly, but it is interesting.  
i tried to modify ZUP to implement mr pips rule, but still failed until now ... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1) ... (as i am not a good coder .. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) ...  
if you have any information about it, it will be great. i will always hope your idea on this harmonic "pattern" ,  
and how to apply it to trading ... thank you in advance.  
Have a nice day ....

Hi Classy,  
I am still learning about VSA, some times ago i read some text about it, but still can not grasp the essence of it, still trying ... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
Two make sure about this (i hope i am on the right path about this volume stuff), i read some links, for example :  
[https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...a-with-malcolm](https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/241760-vsa-with-malcolm)  
[https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...ading-with-vsa](https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/1109845-trend-trading-with-vsa)  
and some other links ...  
  
Above are just some of the stuffs i am trying to understand too at the moment (not intensively reading it yet), and may be in the future. i am still trying to find an indicator or ideas by one of best good old friend of mine, about averaging the volume, but still can not find it.  
i am sure it can be used not only for forex, but also for other instrument: Gold as example. if you have any information about it, please share. i will try my best ... have a nice &good day, Classy.

most of the trader not like like volume very much they say like not real volume ,not right info ... actual fact is you have learn to read volume and price properly or it is better to leave pva ..imho . as i told you earlier ,for you just see how smart money accumulated . price volume anomaly , low volume no supply .no demand on up fractal. running eur gbp example

> {quote} hi classy You are welcome always. Sorry this will take some time as I am busy this week to setup new server hardware to be re-located datacenter. It will take a few more days till this weekend to get all the testing done and verified. But so far, I manage this below: 1) to show the previous D1 hi-lo with 50% (indicator) 2) to show previous Week high-low (indicator) 3) a script to manual plot the Fib 50% on any selected swing. {image}

hi mate bigemm ,would you please check indicator . if i drag and drop your fibo 50% script than default fibo ratios or any fibo indicator ratios conflict and gone and turn to your fibo 50% ratios only. i need both fibo one is for smart money optimal entry and your script to measure orderblock or any swing /high-low . if it is not too much bother you please fix it (check image)  
  
i tried to use fibo3 tools indicator but same all ratios gone

Hi Classy,  
one simple question to your system, logic, idea/PA in this case. is it also work for big TF like W1... and above ? or better just look for D1,H4, and below ? is it also work fine for other pairs? or at least all majors? like: AU & NU , UCAD for example ? I am not so sure about this ... Any clue ? thanks a lot.

Hi Classy  
  
This guy offers some good advice about the way people make mistakes like holding trades etc but imo he makes a dumbass comment about pessimism and optimism.  
  
"Become optimistic about winning trades, let them run and become pessimistic about losing trades". In my book this comment has 2 flaws.  
  
1\. Using this philosophy in trading is reinforcing the Fear and Greed monster to surface. Letting trades run because you are optimistic they are winning is just bad form and you will likely see your profits wither away when the market corrects. Pessimism for losing trades will encourage you to cut short trades that could follow your plan to return to a winning status.  
  
2\. Encouraging any sort of emotional response imo is detrimental to a good trader. A losing trade and a winning trade are just two numbers that encompass the whole within your trading plan.  
  
I liked the video above this one however.  
  
Thanks for the postings.   
Matt.

My first post so be nice but this is how I see the GU doing. It appears we are going to go up, possibly to 1.34. This is a daily chart and based on the pattern will take approx 20-22 days to get to 1.26 so 1.34 maybe by end of the year which is my guess.  
  
Hopefully my thought process is mildly interesting to you.

FIBO SECRET IS ONE OF MY TRUSTED WEAPON, MY SECRET OF STRESS FREE TRADING...  
Trust  
How many times have you not taken a trade simply because you hesitated? I am guilty of this too. Upon closer inspection and deeper reflections, it dawned upon me that I didn’t trust my trading system entirely. Stick to your system and you will be rewarded in due time. Of course, make sure your system has been backtested and know the conditions that it works best in.

There was a weis wave indicator for mt4 and mt5 that had pullback levels,  
support and resistance levels. Does anybody still have a copy of that exact   
version of the weis wave indicator? I lost mine. The levels were very useful.

Thank you. However, the other Weis wave indicator was different...the best I had ever used. There were 2 versions of it. One came with levels.
