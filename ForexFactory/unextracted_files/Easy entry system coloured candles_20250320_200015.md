Here's a nice simple system.  
  
It was passed onto me, I take NO CREDIT for it (well maybe a little). Nore do I know where it originated. however I have changed and added a few things.  
  
My normal trading style means that i am often looking at my screen waiting for trades which can take days to arrive. So i decided to try something while waiting and decided on this. i have only been demo-ing this for a couple of weeks but it has performed very well. Now I'm no fan of lots of indicators however this is a very simple trend following system.  
  
open a 15m chart and open 4hr chart (add templates)  
  
Buy Entry: look for long term trend on 4hr chart, make sure we have green candles and green dots  
go to 15m look for the arrow to be Green, look for the candle to be Green, look for the ultra-signal dots to be Green....enter at the Break of that candle........vice versa for sells.  
  
Take profit is up to you, I look at 'trendsqueezer' percentage, if it's low it signals the trend is getting weak so it could be time to exit.  
For SL I often put it at the bottom of the signal candle  
  
doesn't repaint, nice and simple.  
  
I have been trying this on EU at 15m and 4hr. however there's no reason why it can't be used on other pairs and used for scalping or long term trades. Just pick a longer term trend and enter using smaller TF. I believe on the original they just used a single TF and entered in all directions.

think that's all  
  
I've included an ADR indi (always good to know if we have exceed the average days pips) and news indi (always important to know if news is due)  
  
  
additional things to look for....  
trendsqueeze giving a high percentage will help determing strength of trend,   
look to see what has happened earlier that day on lower TF, higher TF may be green but has lower TF been mainly red?  
is Ultra-signal dots flat or trending at a nice angle? If flat still take trade but maybe be quicker to exit.  
remember all trades are different and should be treated that way  
  
Try it, it's nice and simple.

fx baraka yes it would end up a good trade, but you can see all the arrows in a small area. typing an explanation on a chart in a small area would have been messy. so in, out, in, out, in sort of thing.

I don't think so...once their painted that's it. Could be wrong but I've placed lines on entries and exits, closed MT4 and re-opend to find it's still the same. never tried it on 1min chart and watched though.  
However if you open up to a 1min chart you will find a number of single coloured 'dots' and candles'...normaly when something repaints these single anomalies would be re-painted.

This system is very simple and kraven demonstrates his skill by checking the larger time frame. Bravo. I have no doubt this is a profitable system. I might like to make a suggestion or two that would increase profits: if the dotted line crosses up your original entry (lending support to your long trade) , if price comes back and bounces (giving another valid entry) you could make an additional entry that will double down on the deal and hence the profits. You could also use entries on multiple timeframes to do this: kraven is saying the 15M, and 4Hr, but you could time multiple entries on anything in between adding positions all the way. so the idea I have is to try a small exploratory position to establish a first position, once another entry is confirmed you can add more positions using multiple timeframes as and if they achieve entrys on higher timeframes all the way to the daily. The only thing this system lacks now is a monitor program for multiple currencies and timeframes..... Am not a coder though. Good luck master kraven

It crashes mine too. One of them does anyway.  
  
Eight or ten indicators on one chart would be hard on any platform.

stumpy as I said originaly I don't give a TP. every trade is different. do what you feel comfortable with. the trendsqueezer if below 50% trend is weakening and reversing, wait until that candle forms, if the next candle surpasses it and the % gets less think about getting out.  
  
lazylobster I agree with this 'you could time multiple entries on anything in between adding positions all the way', but again I'm just keeping it simple.  
  
Sorry about the crashing guys. it works fine on my platform, doesn't slow it down at all. If it's ultra trend maybe a coder could see why.

This is because some of you uses another MT4 build then the Threadstarter.  
if kravens MT4 build is 419 and others uses an older MT4 build then it crashes.  
to fix this is only possible if the .mq4 file will provided or if everyone uses the same MT4 build.  
  
  
Cheers

Hi Kraven,  
how about if we get an entry after all requirements are met but the 'trendsqueezer' percentage is below 50%, do we take the trade or leave it?  
Thanks

For those having problems with platform crashes, just put a CCI(45) on your chart. It's the same thing as the UltraTrend. Just watch for zero line crosses.

MT4 build 419 works just fine, update your MT4 and problems should go away.

sorry guys can't help with the MT4 crashing, but mine is the updated version. updated last week and have no problems.  
  
CCI set at 45 is not the same..that is the same as the arrows  
  
Kasapreko yes you could use arrow to exit but you would loose a lot of profit, it could be used as the last resort get out though. I take entry even though trendsqueeze is low, may be the start of the trend.  
  
this is my chart. i just switched it on. so if someone has been running theirs for a while today then they can compare for repaints.  
shortly we will get all red on 4hr. I wait for a pullback on the 15min, at least 1 new signal to enter (candle changes green then red, red arrow appears etc)

Important to know, if by comparing the 4h chart is, that every broker may have different candles, because of their server timezone.  
  
The same is with daily candles, but every chart is mostly identical in the H1 and smaller timeframes.

Kraven, can you suggest any other way of exiting other than the trendsqueeze cause I'm seeing it move too much below and above 50% but price still goes the same direction   
Thanks

Kraven - looks like a simple idiot-proof method - backtesting now.  
  
silly question, where do i see the trendsqueeze u are referring to on the actual screen?

the percentage figures on top of the screen just seem to refer to the amount of time left in the current candle, or am i missing something?!

the trendsqueeze indi is new to me and I was told it was the strength of trend %. however, I've only had it my charts for a day or so and haven't had time to study it. if it is candle time then there's no need for it as i added candletime indi.

thanks for pointing that out guys.  
as i said I've been demo accounting this for a week only, some of the indi's got added along the way and I haven't had a lot of time to screen watch. But from what i have seen using it in conjuction with a higher TF it fairs very well.

Actually, the indicator code is based on CCI(45). There is a decompiled version in this thread: <http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=214889>. Seems this is a commercially available indicator that is sold online. You can easily search and find it.

Hi Kraven,  
  
Did entry is according to the rules right? or do you only trade the London session?

No I tend to trade US/Asia now, but it's like other systems you have to expect it slower at that time due to the markets  
I actualy would have entered at the first new red arrow at 19:00 (i mentioned this in an earlier post about just looking for 1 new indicator when in a trend) also i tend to be cautious around round numbers and your right on one. good luck with the trade

Please do not slay me: Which file has the arrow indicator? And into while folder should it go in MT4? I am clearly doing something wrong because I have beautiful dots and colors, but no arrows. Help from anyone appreciated.  
Thanks!

hadley: arrow is CCIarrow indi, put it in experts: then idicators, with the others  
  
Forex Girl: I use the 4hr for overall trend. I wait until all red on 4hr, then go to 15m, then wait, we often get a pullback then another signal in the direction of the 4hr (always a dot plus either a red arrow or candle)  
  
thanks pudsybear i'll take a look.

yes it is Kfx, however the candle you point out on your chart has an additional 2 candles to mine. this is were the CCI is bouncing around the center line (could repaint these candles?)

Do you mean the arrow indi? ...  
  
I just check the CCI 45 and all it's ok. When the line cross the 0 level, a new arrow appears.

In your MT4 click on "help" then "about", your build number will be there. Top of your screen.  
  
Normally MT4 will alert you to a new version, if it hasn't you'll probably have to check your broker and see what version they are currently running, If they have 419 you'll have to do a download and reinstall, you'll also have to set up your indicators again though.  
  
  
Watching this thread also, I like the easy stuff ^_^ I'm using heiken ashi with levels and a stochastic myself at this time. 

&amp;quot;You know what needs to be addressed , completely completely reverse that&amp;quot;.

Here's what I did...  
  
Right click on your platform's icon and select "Run As Administrator." Once it is opened, it should automatically alert you of a live update. Run the live update, close your platform, and then reopen your platform as you normally would. Once you open it, click on the "about" tab to see if it was updated.

Does it matter that there wasn't a red candle nor a red dot to go with the red arrow? I thought that all needed to line up for it to be a valid signal. Do you just wait for a red dot and red candle (for a short signal) on the 15m if everything doesn't line up when the arrow appears?

I think isn't necessary candle or dot indis line up with the arrow. Maybe kraven can clarify.

hope some of you got into the EU signal, i wasn't around but it looks good..  
  
seems a bit of confusion about how i do re-entries..  
  
imagine we had a big move down like on 2nd may. because we wait until the 4hr shows a down trend (all signals are red) we will miss that move on the 15min. So now we look fo a re-entry.  
  
what i look for is a red dot (always) plus 1 other signal. sometimes we'll have a change of colour candle, but as long as the dots red as soon as candle changes to red or i have a red arrow i'll re-enter. Most of the time all are red (ideal) but not always...see pics, all circles are entries

this is how i'd have played this if i had got in...often using the 4hr to pick a TP, every trade exit is different.  
  
even though we have a red arrow on the 15m on the prior candle we have no red dot until the next candle....nice and simple.  
  
were in a downtrend on 4hr, we look for it to continue on 15m or we wait until an uptrend forms on the 4hr and then vice versa  
  
ed. my sl would now be at .3103 locking in about 15pips....this is purely how i'd do this, if your in your about 40pips up so your call anyway good luck for any who got this.

IBFX Aus haven't upgraded their platform to latest build yet. Try another broker like Alpari

I am so sorry to ask again, but I have put the mq4 file in experts>indicators and still do not get arrows. The mq4 file just shows as a text file but doesn't show up in indicators and doesn't execute.  
  
I am sure I am an idiot, but if anyone could help me understand what I am doing wrong, I'd be most appreciative.  
  
Thanks,  
Hadley

remove the file.  
  
download new one from my first post.  
  
put it in experts:indicators  
  
then start up your MT4 and see if that works, the arrows are basicaly CCI set at 45 when it crosses over.

Still no go.  
  
I'm updated to v419 of metatrader. I'm wondering if it has something to do with the file being an mq4txt rather than an exe4  
  
There's a way to convert mq's to exe's in meta-editor but i'm pretty unsophisticated and couldn't make it work when I followed the directions.  
  
I did do exactly what you said- deleted, installed to experts>indicators but it doesn't show up in my indicators file and the only thing i can think of is that i's the MQ4 extension.  
  
Maybe eventually someone geekier than me will read this and save the idiot! ;-)  
  
Meanwhile I set the CCI at 45 and made the zero line yellow and am using vertical lines. We'll see how that goes!  
  
I greatly appreciate your efforts, and your willingness to share and help.   
  
Thank you!  
Hadley

Hi txt file is not good i think. Try not to take from the thread post but take from the paperclip on top right. This i know to work sometimes with this error.

driftwoods suggest is what i was going to suggest next. sometimes taking the indi straight from the post for some reason leads to faults. go to paperclip on the top right corner where the page number is and download from there. thanks driftwood

i've been semi paper trading and demo running this now since the 20th (not long). and before i throw out my piece of paper that i've been scribbling down the entries and possible exits i seen down i thought i'd post them here..this is not super accurate, just the entries i picked up looking at the chart.   
first number is the SL size (often i've included a couple of pips for spread and 1 pip over entry) the last number is possible/max take profit (before it drops again and gets another entry). pretty simple cross and drag stuff.  
  
8-32, 22-43, 10-17, (choppy 4am losses 7 and 10) 20-28,12-16,13-18,9-36,11-8,19-41,10-18,7-37,8-29,12-20,20-32, 8 loss, 17-23,22-40  
  
we've been fairly trending, which is what this systems about. this is EU (don't see the point of doing more then 1 or 2 pairs, if you can't make it work on 1 you ain't going to on others). see if you can KIND OF replicate what i got as it's rough.

I've figured out the problem with the crashing. It's the Fxultra Trend indicator. Replace with the one i've uploaded & your good to go ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) I'm running the 409 metatrader version with no problem now .

possibly Kfx I only been checking as i've been running (no back checking). how far did you go back? did you only check the 15m trades in the 4hr direction? it's possible late march was flat, as with any trend following system this would lead to some false signals.

Just from march to now ... And yes, looking at 15m and following the trend in 4h.  
  
I think some days in March and April, some banks close. Maybe this is the reasons of false signals. Low liquidity.

i've had a quick look from March 20 to end of March (buys only) and there are a few losses, these are small and often happen through early Asian session. I feel the wins potential is far greater. again, just a quick scan as i prefer to realtime test.  
just a note: If i get an arrow for my entry my sl goes to the bottom of the arrow (it tends to add about 2-3pips on)

just trying to get to the root of this system... what makes the CCI arrows pop up?? which indicators are they based on?

LOL, it's in the title Yisaiah. CCI arrows is based on the CCI indicator (basic indicator in any mt4 pack). if CCI passes throught the centre an arrow appears.  
  
be careful using so many pair, pretty much all pairs work in conjuction with each other. I'd just stick with 1 or 2.

Hi all,  
  
Newbie here (demo trading for a few weeks only), and thought I'd post.  
  
Love the simplicity of this system!!  
  
I'm at work typing this, so can't post screenies. Set this up yesterday morning, despite it being a UK Bank Holiday, and watched it throughout the day. Eventually placed some trades late last night and went to bed....  
  
Woke up to:  
  
USDCAD - Buy - +100 pips  
EURNZD - Buy - +50 pips  
AUDCAD - Sell - +100 pips  
  
Set up two more orders this morning before work...showing slight profit loss, but moving in the right direction.  
  
Thanks for sharing Kraven....  
  
Regards  
Ath

This system will not work on the long term, guys. I'm just letting you know. It's similar to my old PArbolic SAR and also the BBStop system. Like most indicator systems, this will look great in trends and then wipe you out in the ranges. Forget it and move on. Trust me.

Roofx you are possibly correct, i don't promise holy grail, just a nice straight forwards trend follower system

before i switch off and because i have set a large TP I've decided to take half (+35) leaving the rest to either BE or hit the 1.2905. this would be the 3rd successful trade on EU today with 1 loss. again just demo for now.

Kraven,  
  
This was my second trade with this system, 2 winners, the first was posted a few posts back, this one ended with +26pips with a SL of 9 pips, nice ratio ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1). This trade was made on my live account, I was more than willing to risk the 9pips  
  
thank you

GBPJPY - Sell - -50 pips ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f62b.png?v=15.1)  
  
Went back in on AUDNZD when I got home - Buy - another +50 pips  
  
Set some last night before bed, and results as follows:  
  
EURGBP - Sell - +50 pips  
EURUSD - Sell - +100 pips

sounds like he's picking TP off 4hr chart. however a 50pip loss on 1 bet also seems he's using 4hr for SL. I am only using this one EU.  
  
still in EU (sl 9 pips) currently up +64 (i'd normally settle for this)

I realise I'm jumping around the pairs a fair bit looking for opportunities. I am, however, using my discretion on the 15m chart, coupled with looking for **strong** trends on the 4hr chart.  
  
Question for Kraven:  
Do you think this system has any merit moving up the timeframes? Do you think it would work using a Daily/1hr frame rather than 4hr/15m?  
  
I'm new to indicators and wondered if these would need changing to accomodate?

For me 25pip tp is good. So far 2 trades 2 wins = 50pip ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) Thx kraven.

@Driftwood  
  
I'm not being terribly scientific at this stage about my TP. I realise this is a bad habit to get into, so as of next week I will be working my MM out correctly.  
  
I have been careful to trade into strong trends on both charts, and I've simply set TP @ 100 (or 50) by gauging the strength of the move on the bars.  
  
I'm trying to take the emotion out of it and be as mechanical as possible. I'm trying to 'trust the system'....  
  
I will be increasing my risk next week, and hence be more careful with my TP!  
  
I hope that makes sense?!

I am curious to know, did you found any system that works for a long term? and what is it BBStop system ?

no reason why it wouldn't work on higher TF's  
  
  
I find 15m give more reliable entries plus more entries in total. I original tried this on 5mins without the bigger TF for trend but I was in and out all of the time.  
  
I have had outstanding results the weeks i've been testing and improving this. This may get choppy in flat situations and we'll sufferer a number of small losses (normaly in early Asian time for me), but if do as Athraven is doing and try to see good trends in the 4hr then this will help also going for a good R:R and early BE.  
  
I'm still in the other trade at one point it was 1:11 R:R. (if i was around I'd have taken this) we've had 1 loss, and 2 positive re-entries since.

The reason I was asking about the Daily/1hr timeframe was hopefully to see if we could make the ranging sessions easier to manage.  
  
I am new to this, so I may be talking rubbish, so please let me know if I am...  
  
It seems to me that this system is good for strong trending movements, and we will likely suffer in a ranging market. I think there are enough currency pairs to look at - I can't believe they would all range at the same time? Does this happen?  
  
If it is ranging, should we move up the timeframes to look for longer terms pips before moving down when it trends again?

Ath

Kraven,  
  
is it possible to have an email notification when all conditions are meet to have a probably trade? what do you think it needs to be done?  
  
I am missing almost all trades, currently I am 3 winners at EURUSD and 1 loser at GBPUSD, the loser at GBPUSD was my fault due to the tigh SL  
  
Thank you

sorry migmac i have zero programming skills. I am missing a lot of the trades too, most of mine have been on paper while monitoring.  
  
Athravan you can't avoid ranging markets, it can range on any TF. pretty much all strategies will get caught in ranges (apart from scalping) It's part of trading. We'd all be rich if we new when it was about to range..'it's trending today i'll enter, but tommorrow it'll range so i'll stay in bed'.   
You need to realise as soon as you hit the order button you have no control or forwards knowledge where the price will go. We can try to use signals and signs to give us an 'edge' or 'heads up' like trending markets, news, candle formations, S&R. but if these were 100% reliable we would have no losses.  
What you need to think about is not the loses, but the win ratio and the reward ratio. If you have 10 bets per week and you win 4, and you R:R is 1:2 you'll still be on top. If it's 1:4 and we win 2, but move to BE after 1:1 is hit and as a result lose 4...then if your sl is 10, you lose 40pips..but your 2 wins get you 80pips, the rest BE.  
  
from the short time i've studied this system it has produced 80%+ positive results. and an average R:R of 1:3..if it stopped like this then i'm charging all you guy's $5k for it lol. All the banks etc will install it. But it will not stay this way, ranging is due and so are loses. you can stop with it for a while (i will) or move to another system (like so many do, and keep moving, not getting anywhere). Sorry for lecture.

Only had an hour to look for opportunities last night and found these:  
  
EURUSD - Sell - +150 pips  
CHFJPY - Sell - +101 pips (my entry pipped up 1 after setting TP at 100!)

on EU through Asian session we had one small false entry for about 6 pips and we have an entry now. there is a lot of news today which is good for movement, however for me this is the time for caution as market has moved sharply lower over the last few days so it's due a correction or consolidation, again we don't know this for sure.

@robuk  
  
I'm in the UK and work fulltime 8.30-5.30. I occasionally get to look at trades before 8am (end of Tokyo session) but usually look for a couple of hours in the evening around 8pm-10pm (end of NY, beginning of Sydney).  
  
Its early days in my trading career - still on demo account - and I'm trying to establish an emotionless approach. I like to pick a trade, set TP and then walk away. Some have closed while I watch, others I have left to run overnight (like the last CHFJPY one).

If someone will specify **EXACTLY **what conditions need to be met , I will have a go at programming it for you.  
I'm finding this quite an interesting thread, however I too have reservations about ranging periods, I guess time will tell!

well, it seems to be working out very well for you so far , i hope it continues in the same vein .  
i am from uk but now live in thailand , so to trade your times it would be 2am to 4 am , but if i could get results half as good as yours it would be worth it !!   
have you tried the daily/i hour idea ?  
good luck

@robuk  
  
I hope it continues this way too!! I will continue to demo, as I am aware that there is a lot of movement at the moment.  
  
Over the weekend I will be looking at historical Daily/1hr timeframes to see if this still works as well, and will let the forum know on Mon/Tue next week.  
  
@everyone lurking  
  
Can someone advise me please on taking screenshots so I can show actual results to people?

Kraven,  
  
Steve is going to help us! Where do you think an email alert will be great to have? what conditions do you think are the best to have a possible trade soon and that will give us some time to analyse the trade before entering? maybe when ultra-signal and cci arrow are on the same color?

I've just noticed "FXultratrend.edu" has a built in alert, seems to do the job?

well the conditions i look for:  
  
4hr red or green everything (ultra-signal dot, cci arrow, ultratrend candle)this to me means trend has been established for a short time.  
  
15min (ultra-signal dot...plus either one of the arrow or candle, i prefer both but using just one has let me get in earlier)  
  
as Steve said ultrratrend has an alert..  
  
'....this is the time for caution as market has moved sharply lower over the last few days so it's due a correction or consolidation, again we don't know this for sure.'   
this appears to be true for today. we may get a move up then a red continuation, or we may have to wait a day or so for a green trend to begin..hopefully it'll not be flat for to long.  
If you look at your 4hr chart and skim through you nsee we have had some great runs lately, medium trends which have lasted.

hi Kraven  
firstly , thanks very much for all the time and effort you've put into thread for others to benefit .  
? if (say) a red arrow appears above a blue candle and then a couple of bars later bars and dots turn red , is that a sell signal.  
regards ,Rob

Morning all,  
  
I was kicking myself last night - had a bad day at work and got in late. When I'd eaten and put the kids to bed, I sat in front of my PC and had a look for possible trades.  
  
Found three, BUT I was tired and not concentrating:  
  
1\. Not all the indicators were there - the trend looked good and the prices had just started moving  
2\. I forgot - yes forgot - to set SL  
  
The prices started going the wrong way, and I realised what I'd done wrong. I hadn't stuck to my plan. and this could bite me.  
  
So, I thought, there's a lesson to be learnt here, and in the words of Morpheus - 'lets see how deep the rabbit hole goes'.  
  
I figured I ought to let it run anyway and see what the punishment could look like.  
  
I turned off and went to bed...  
  
Switched PC on this morning before work to see what had happened and **LUCKILY** the trades had made their way to my TPs - so I still won out.  
  
The point of this ramble, I guess, is to point out that you can't be lucky in this game. You have to stick to your plan, and I didn't.

Ath

Yesterday's trades were:  
  
EURUSD - Sell - +103 pips (took 3.5 hours to hit)  
AUDCHF - Sell - +101 pips (took 3 hours to hit)  
EURNZD - Buy - +99 pips (took 2.5 hours to hit)  
  
The charts on these weren't necessarily the best setups as I said, so you may not learn a lot from these.

That may be right,  
not that its a big downer,   
you can do a lot with 30 pips a day

Absolutely, consistently getting 30 pips a day is more than enough ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

All,  
  
My sincerest apologies - I have confused pips and pipettes while I have been posting.  
  
I did say I was a newbie (!) - so in reality all my results need to be divided by 10 (is that right?).  
  
I really hope I haven't mislead anyone into thinking this is a 'super system'.  
  
I'm at work at the moment, but I will upload some charts when I get home, and you can put me back on the right track again.  
  
Regards  
Ath

yes luck can go far in this game.  
  
i got in early my trade and got out with 15pips, it was 40pips up   
  
sorry Rob never seen your post, the order doesn't matter. if you get an arrow first....then you wait for the dot then enter(by this time candle will prob change colour too)   
  
we just had a good example of a no entry..red dot but no candle or arrow.

lol.  
  
anthraven i was thinking that because you were letting them run you were riding through all the in's and outs. e.g. if you entered EU late on the 8th and let it run you'd be over 100pips up.

No problem. some nice moves on the GU and AU  
  
  
I have been testing this on EU now for a little over 3 weeks and it has been excellent. Hopefully this will continue with the 4hr/15min combo. my main problem is missing most of the entries so i might open another pair or 2 for next week. See how that goes, then i have a small account to go live

I have never had so much trouble loading indicators even though I have Build 419. I can't get the CCI "dots" to show on the chart. Where do I find it and where does it go: experts > indicators? I think I have all of the other basics but can't get the dots up. I would appreciate some help, thnk you.

Hi Kraven  
Looking for multiple time frame confirmation is a great way to go. Having an indi to define your trend is also fine, otherwise you'd also be chucking out virtually every other methodology e.g. trading above below a ma. That's exactly the same concept i.e. using an indi to define trend.  
  
A 45 CCI on a 4hr chart is much higher than the typical 14 setting. The only issue you have is when the market might be turning and taking a few days to sort itself out (so lets describe that as ranging).   
  
If you want to see how system performs look at X days in uptrend, downtrend and yes when market is ranging. On D chart 27 Mar-2 April was horrible. On 4hr it was solid green so that takes out a whole load of counter trend 15 min sells. I also see a lot of none rules compliant buys = no trades.  
  
Whilst I have to do a lot more investigation having an indi definition of trend is fine, having MTF check is fine, having entry from pullback on LTF is fine.  
  
I've shown 4hr for the above period and an example of 15 min. Watch for times of news, previous proven SR levels, space between entry and next SR level and other basic trading requirements and ask would any other method have performed better.  
  
All the best. Definitely worth watching.  
  
Regards

@robuk  
  
I agree it worked out well in the end, but the point I was trying to make in post 125, was that I had ignored the rules of entry.  
  
In all three instances the market almost immediately turned against me, and I could have panicked and pulled my orders. I needed to see what happened next; either I would get my arse kicked by the market, or the trend would follow through and I would get my profit...  
  
@Vantage  
  
I'm not sure I understand - I may be mistaken (and Kraven may need to correct me here as well!), but the rules of the system would have meant that I would have only taken a buy trade on the very last green arrow on your M15 chart (the one just below the 61.8 line).  
  
Are you saying that there were more trades available then the rules allow you to take? If so, does this system only allow you to take the 'safest' ones?

Ath

I belive on the vantage graphs, that the first green arrow is a valid losing trade, since on the h4 the trend was up and the price broke up the signal candle correct?

@migmac  
  
On Vantage's graph I can see 11 arrows after the (almost) vertical red dotted line...  
  
I really need Kraven to confirm I have interpreted the rules correctly, but here is how I see it:  
  
I can see three arrows where all the colours match up correctly:  
  
Arrow 4 (red arrow, red trend dot, red candle)  
Arrow 8 (red arrow, red trend dot, red candle)  
Arrow 11 (green arrow, green trend dot, green candle)  
  
Arrows 4 and 8 are against the H4 trend so I wouldn't have entered, but Arrow 11 is with the H4 trend, so I would enter.  
  
All the other arrows are a mix of colours...  
  
You could argue that arrow 5 was a good place to enter, as the red trend was weakening and S&R came into play, but I really need to learn a lot more about S&R before I try...  
  
Does that help?  
  
Regards  
Ath

Ath,  
  
I agree with all what you just said, on the arrow 5 I will had placed a pending order at the break of the candle which will not have been filled and I will have deleted before the weekand  
  
But I was refering to the first green arrow just on the second candle in the M5 graph, I would have enter there and lost, if the graph was just intended to show the arrows after the fibs them sorry my mistake

Sorry mig - I'm with you now - I was only looking at the fib area that Vantage had highlighted.  
  
Looking at the candle you highlighted, then I guess it depends on your TP, as I would have entered on that arrow as well.  
  
I have been setting mine to 10 pips (mistakenly thinking this was 100 if you read my earlier posts ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f62b.png?v=15.1)), and that would have been profit.  
  
Even letting it run for 3 hours, you could have taken approximately 30 pips from that run.

So one thing I'm unclear on. You get your H4 trend. 15M dot, arrow and candle agree. Stop order at break of that candle.   
  
But how long is that break order good for. How many candles do you wait before that setup is no longer valid?  
  
Thanks

@robuk  
  
So was I! I don't understand what you're asking - as I wouldn't normally have entered as the colours weren't all lined up. I thought it would go wrong but it didn't....  
  
@spyderman  
  
Good question - would take someone more experienced than me to help I think. I'm intending to go longer on the timeframes, and see if I can adopt a 'set and forget' mentality. I've seen some EAs around that will move your SL and TP as the trend continues - I might experiment with those when I can figure out how to use them.  
  
I'm still on demo - still finding my feet.

I'm not sure you understood my question. My bad. I wasn't referring to an exit strategy. I was referring to the entry.   
  
How long do we wait for the signal bar high/low to be broken before cancelling the entry?

Kraven by his own admission is fairly new to this method and without seeing where the system came from a healthy dose of checkthisoutitis is called for.   
  
2 questions. It looks pretty good at first glance in trend so the obvious thing is to have a careful look at times when market has proved to be ranging. A quick look suggests in that short ranging period I looked at it didn't do a lot of damage. If your method stands/doesn't nail you too badly in those circumstances you should be ahead of the game.  
  
Then can the settings be reasonably improved? Or does it have a good enough win/reward ratio without this.  
  
A 45 CCI on 4hr is roughly equal to a quick cci on D and same thing on 15 min, its roughly equal to a normal cci on 1hr. Basically you are trading then with D and 1hr in agreement as both colours must agree.  
  
I think there are potentially more trades but only investigation will tell.

I like to look at a method and see if its an improvement on what I have now. 21 Feb a decent evening star pattern on D below a previous R level 5900. On 22nd I'd need a hell of a lot of convincing to be buying. 4hr misses this move but 1hr clear. 15 min has had 38% retrace so should be decent sell chance.  
  
Picking 1 set up and moaning is not fair I agree, but there are several others I could post. I do know I'd want my method to catch this kind of move.   
  
I don't know whats the answer as yet, 4hr/15 min, 1hr/15 min. I do know I'm interested and willing to see if it stands up as is or needs tweaking. it might just be a case of trading as normal and see if this provides additional opportunities down the road.  
  
Will still be investigating and watching with interest.

I guess I may be missing your point Vantage. Are you saying we wouldn't have gotten an entry here. It would seem, based on your vertical lines, that we would have gotten an entry on the 15m. 4h shows red dot. 15 min. gets an arrow/candle, but no dot. But next candle we get the dot. I think Kraven would classify this as an entry candle and we would have gotten quite a ride down.

spydy for me I will wait a couple of hours if the entry hasn't been triggered i'll cancel as it's obviously ranging...again you'll find it's a flip of the coin, you could leave it and find it goes against you, you could cancel and find 3hrs later it plummets like a stone and your pips up. I tend to look at the SL, if it's 10 i'll chance my arm, if it's large i'll play safe.  
  
hello Vantage, we've both been trading different systems now long enough to know nothings perfect or ever will be. we could try changing settings and find the bad entries you have seen will go for us....but one's which have went for us or kept us out of false trades with a different setting will then go against us (you know what I mean). But your input and findings will be welcome.  
  
I've found so far i've found this to be true   
"It looks pretty good at first glance in trend so the obvious thing is to have a careful look at times when market has proved to be ranging. A quick look suggests in that short ranging period I looked at it didn't do a lot of damage. If your method stands/doesn't nail you too badly in those circumstances you should be ahead of the game."  
  
but we will hit times were we will get several losses in a row, after all this is a trend following system and if the market fails to trend then it's choppy. this applies to all TF's. I find the 15m keeps these losses down and remember you pick your exit.  
  
hell i've even been looking at just trading the 4hr, enter at the break when candle and dot match..give SL 50pips, take half at 50, sl to BE, TP 150????

The 8am 4hr candle closed when the move had almost finished, the 10am 1hr close was clear and 15 min move happened after that.  
  
Kraven is right no system will get everything and I know we both have other methods that would have signalled that 1hr move, so I'll also focus on looking at what other solid opportunities this gives. Theres lots to like about the concept.

Vantage I don't know if you believe in leaving a bet open over the weekend but lately i've recorded that gap often follows our entry, and if it doesn't it tends to close again before it goes in the wrong direction.  
  
Take this friday. 18:45 entry GMT, my min SL of 10, then a continued drop of 95. Same thing last week. 20-22nd gives an example of it going against us then classic gap closing so it would still be a 12/70 bet.

I've only had a brief look through, i'm sure there's one's that didn't work this well.

Given the number and type of MTF indis out there it shouldn't be difficult to code that so you can see multiple time frames as a bar on the one chart. Of course I speak as a non-coder.

Hi Kraven  
  
We are strictly in and out. Would never leave a trade open under current conditions i.e. euro zone mess but selling at the moment and leaving prob a safer option.  
  
If news was to come out though that Greece managed to get some kind of agreement going forward (2 chances slim and none?) the gap up could be significant.  
  
We prefer to take our 20-30 pips which relates to 2-3% and be done. Its our personality as traders so we stick to it.

Hi Vantage,   
  
I am totally sold on 20-30 pips a day, that soon ads up given enough discipline and time.  
  
This looks a very simple way to achieve that, combined with some lower time frame PA

i personaly like higher TF SR using lower TF entry.  
  
have started watching GU as well now and had 2 good entries on both. missed the big GU entry but caught the EU. On this one i waited until .2800 became Resistance before i got in and had a 20pip SL, letting it run(tp at .2710)   
still only demo, need to see some choppier climate to really evaluate. however if i had jumped in i'd be a very happy man over the last 4 weeks with the results.  
  
****hit tp this morning for 1:4 rr

for SL first i always take a look at our entry cande, if it has an arrow above/below i will include this too, normaly adds 2 pips. I also give a pip or 2 for breakout. As a general rule on SL I normaly go for a min of 10, I also prefer to use a max of 20 however if i feel a few more pips will decrease the risk of getting stopped out then i'll do that.  
  
TP is up to the user. I know a few just look for 20-30 pips. I like to look at SR levels on 4hr or daily to pick a target. Once i'm comfortable in profit i like to move to BE. My aim isn't just to make pips, it's also to not loose any.

my TP got hit for +23 also got the next entry originaly 18 pip SL, it went 20, I've moved to BE. TP 1.2637.  
  
Below is the recent GU move. this is why I'm trying a trend following system using different TF's. Smaller SL from smaller TF, bigger TP from bigger TF. Would have been nice to catch this early, even from today.

Hi wrapocs... could you please only add the required indicators inside the zip file instead of the whole Indicator folder of your MT4 ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
or you can simply attached the indi with your post rather than a zip file.

Hi Kraven,   
  
I agree the 5 min can be choppy, I have been using it as a tool to enter having taken the signal on the 15 min.   
  
Just thought I would post this chart, 5min that does look good today.  
  
I have been out today hope some one got some pips.

question is if you used it in conjunction with a higher TF like 4hr there is one entry that loses.  
  
I beieve the founder of most of this system used the 5min and just went in and out of entries. apparently he did ok doing this.

migmac my first post says it all. All I know is he used it on 5m and took all trades. claims he/she? did well just doing that. I added a few things but nothing that will interfere with the original concept. Main difference is I use 4hr for trend and 15m for entry.  
I tried the 5m first, works ok, found i was in and out a lot though.

Alright I finally upgraded my MT4 platform and all the indicators are working good. Im just confused about candle break. What is that, that shows us when to enter and not to enter if there hasn't been any candle break. Thank you

a candle break is when we have a set-up candle and the next candle surpasses it....so the entry candle is a sell and the bottom of that candle is 100, if the next candle goes to 101 we enter the trade.

Dear Albertdkpllh: if you only demo traded for 2 days I'd like to say that it might be a little too early to go live unless you been on demo longer and been at least through simple forex school. This is my honest advice.

Kraven thank you so much for explanation. I watched the charts and it seemed like there was no signal yet until I saw some charts that you posted. That made more sense. Thank you so much.

no problem.  
  
Albertdkpllh I have been demo and paper trading the EU now for around 5 weeks and the results have been nothing short of fantastic (a simple back check will show this). I was planning on live trading this week myself but decided to wait a while longer.

Kraven I think I am still missing something out. Im sorry to ask you again. I tried to search some examples on google about candle break but didn't find any.   
  
I looked again at charts in post 3 where you marked candles that were no break and again looked at trades that you took and seems like there is something that Im not catching. Please show example. Thank you.

it's really quite simple. To Sell: We have our red Dot and red signal candle, for an entry the price of the next candle must go lower by a pip for us to enter. if it doesn't go lower we do not enter (like in the pic below).  
a lot of trading systems rely on the same way to enter.

Great explanation Kraven. Thank you. I understand it now.  
Now on the chart we have small and big arrows. Do you focus more on the big arrows or you look at small ones too? Its just all of a sudden I did something and I can't see small arrows anymore only big so I was wondering if that's gonna affect anything following this system. Thank you .

ultra signal shows dots  
  
well the trend is once again intact and the system (again) performed well. last entry on EU went over 100 and over 60 on GU. I'll go live next week, My main concern is I miss a lot of the entries as I trade mainly US and Asian open now.

You know at first when I lunched the indicators yes I did have big and small arrows. Then I played around with other currencies and small arrows were gone. I tried to fix it but was unable to. But since I compared your charts and arrows with mine looks like I have no mistake. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1) Thank you.

Yes I understand, thank you. The stops are way smaller then the targets so that is the best part of the system.

when you posted this i didn't have my charts on, I thought i'd lost. I opened my charts now to find my GU was successful (i had TP of .5674 low of day for +16) since then 2 more helthy trades going +16 and +40 on GU. the EU was a loss, next one went 1:1 the next +50...  
  
just entered GU before news. **not smart as it lost lol.

the last signal on both EU and GU worked out well (and still are). on EU just exited with +32 (sl was 10). only entered EU.

You wrote that you use stop loss the bottom of signal candle for buy and for sell the top of signal candle is that correct?  
  
Please explain the signals that appeared on the chart below. Thanks.

hopefully the pic will show you how I seen it today. I just looking at the day as a hole. the white lines are where I'd place SL, as I've said many times 'above the arrow if applicable'. the yellow lines are entry, about 1pip below our signal candle.  
Now the blue arrows are our entries...sometimes there are entries after these, BUT if you got in the first entry you'd still be in the bet. the numbers are max TP's.  
  
......so if you just look for a set number when taking TP (of about 20-25pips) you'd still be up 50. ASSUMING you were up for all the entries....if you took them from 8am GMT, you'd be fine to.

no problem Pip M.  
  
The main thing is I have monitored this live (or as live as i could) over the past 5 weeks and it has performed amazingly...Yes we have been in a 'trend market', but thats the point of the system to catch and keep you in the trend....yes we have had some losses, but we have had 4x the wins and it has kept us out of a few false signals too.

Can you please suggest more ways to stay longer in the trade or to regulate our TP.  
  
Do you use S/R, fibs, stochs, RSI or anything to help with the TP? I can go with 10 pips from every trade but what if I will have some losses and it won't be very good in a long run.

i look for recent lows or RN's.  
  
when the market moves as much as it has you have to go to middle of last year to see when it was there last on EU. I look at day chart and see if we have any confluence, basicaly the high,low, open or close of daily candles...around 1.2467 stands out to me, so 2460-70.

Kraven, this method is so close to the grail. i realise if i am to take all trade signals, i win a lot more than i loose. the indicators truely do not repaint and this makes backtesting a bit more reliable. I am building up my faith and courage.   
  
Pls. Kraven, assuming we have 20 entry signals and the smart money boys decide to manupulate the market and plant about 6 bad trades. how do we get out of such trades. Personally it think placing a sizable SL should take care of that. Now what SL from all our studies would u say is appropriate.   
  
Again there are periods when the market seems to be consolidating in the 4h and that reflects in the 15, especially when there is abt to be an general trend reversal in the 4hr. how do we get out of bad trades.   
  
Thanks 

My help is in the name of the Lord who made heaven and earth.

[quote=Roofx;5647769]This system will not work on the long term, guys. I'm just letting you know. It's similar to my old PArbolic SAR and also the BBStop system. Like most indicator systems, this will look great in trends and then wipe you out in the ranges. Forget it and move on. Trust me.[/quote  
  
You may be right, but can you explain how it will wipe you out in ranging markets??? The rules are pretty clear. you should be able to determine the general trend from your 4hr. then you take entries in the 15min. Occasionally when the consolidations start, you will have less confirmed entries and the few that turn out bad trades, u have your SL to take care of. Besides, the wins by far over shadow the loss and my aim is to maximize my wins and minimize my loss.   
  
This system in my demo gives me over 100 pips a day,   
Waiting to go live soon, Great Systems!!!!   
Thanks!!!!!

Albertdkpllh it's simple...you take the losses. it's all part of trading.   
  
you can use common sense though..for example the last entry the market had moved 60pips already before we get an entry, that's to much. A lot of 15min swings are around 50-80 before it comes back..see pic.

yes. very well......the GU and EU both had signals today and both are still running at profits. I did not take either though as the moves were quite big before a clear signal had been given (similar to the pic in my last post)

This is a great system - have been following it from beginning and have put it into practice now with very good success - just as you have explained it.  
  
I am in New Zealand and see you are currently live on FF so you must be close to me. Plus you have said you trade Asian Session as I do - If one is careful you can do quite well in this session on 15m TF.  
  
Cheers and thanks for your ongoing help in this forum.

Once again 2 good trades..GU sl was 25 for me, bailed at +50 (still going down) EU sl was 28, price is bouncing around 1.2400 area so bailed +45  
  
Roels a few less arrows then me, don't know why. Are you not using the coloured candles?

Kraven there is lots of people following the thread. Not everybody is involved in the thread because signals appear at various times and not everybody can watch the charts and wait because we all have jobs ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1). The last 2 trades that we had I missed the chance again. Im a bit dissapointed, but what I wanna do is check different currencies maybe I will be catching some signals.   
  
Thanks again Kraven ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)...  
  
Oh by the way I wanted to discuss something here on this thread about this system. What if one day one of the indicators stop working or Mt4 will not be able to lunch it anymore or another weird reason that will not allow us to use one of the indicators and we won't be able to use this system anymore. So while we have chance I wanted to focus what this system is build on.   
  
I understand we are trading by the trend only on 15TM checking the trend direction at a higher timeframe. I imagine this dotted line as an ema. Sometimes price touches it and then reverses back and thats when most of the time we have a sell or buy signal. Sometimes when this happens there is no sell or buy signal or arrow appears. I wanted to know why is that. What is exactly that tells it when to enter and when to not. Any ideas? Thank you...

Been busy in the last couple of weeks - took some trades over the last few days, but didn't really make the best of them:  
  
AUDUSD - sell order for 5 pips  
AUDCHF - buy order for -5 pips ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1)  
AUDUSD - sell order for 15 pips  
USDCAD - buy order for 12 pips  
  
I'm finding this system easy to use, and like Pipmaker, I'd like to understand the principles behind the indicators used.  
  
If anyone has any experience of Trade Management EAs that would be great! Been trying to use MPTM, and I think its more complicated than I actually need.  
  
Any recommendations would be gratefully received, and some guidance on settings too...  
  
Stick with it Kraven - I suspect there's a lot of lurkers using this but just not posting....

Hi Rastlin,  
  
Assuming you have used default installation folders, you need to drop the Templates in here:  
  
MetaTrader/experts/templates  
  
And the Indicators in here:  
  
MetaTrader/experts/indicators  
  
The templates will then be available from either the drop down menu at the top, or from the 'right-click' context menu on each chart. The indicators will appear in the bottom left corner of the screen under 'custom indicators' for you to drag and drop onto the charts.  
  
Regards  
Ath

Thanx Athravan. So the template doesn't include the indicators? We needs to drag the indicators to the template?

If you load up the template it will pull the indicators into the chart for you.  
  
If you want to bring extra indicators in (not needed for this system) then you can drag them from the list in the corner.  
  
That was simply for future reference....

Nice to see some traders around. 2:45 signal on GU was a bit big for me, candle about 45, the move down was already 60pips. I waited to see if we had a smaller entry and support at 1.5450, we seemed to so i entered entered at .54280 sl 28 and bailed at .54000 for +28 i bailed too early (it went 70pips) but i figured the move had already ran. On EU my entry went +20, i went to BE then, should have took it but got stopped for 0.

Hi Kraven thank you so much for this system.Would you mind posting your GU chart as I would like to check your entry from this morning.Made a mistake last night on the AUS and EU I entered and then realised I was against the 4 hr trend they both went for 30 pips I guess I got lucky.

Updating at work, so no pictures - let me know if you want me to post them when I get home again.  
  
Last night:  
NZDUSD - Sell order -10 pips ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1)  
AUDUSD - Sell order +25 pips  
  
Before work this morning:  
EURGBP - Buy order +10 pips  
NZDUSD - Sell order - still open but partially closed 2 out of 3 steps to TP  
  
As of last night I've started using **CL_M_02 Complete Trade Manager v2** from <http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=352163>  
  
Really simple to setup, and I can now walk away from the trades and let them run their course.

And NZDUSD just closed 3 out of 3 for +14 pips...  
  
The Trade Management tool I'm using allows you to set SL and TP based on multiples of the ATR (you can tell it the ATR period you want to use).  
  
While I'm experimenting with it, I'm being conservative with the multiples, but the intention is go long for where the price may run, and then set partial close levels for really safe pips...

Missed both trades today. GU would have been 32pip SL trade but went over +100, EU was 39 sl, max TP 38. don't think i've seen a bad day in eight weeks with this system.

I too missed GU and EU thanks to work - and it was dead today because of the upcoming bank holidays here in the UK.  
  
Its amazing how just when you think you've nailed something - the market bites you and you learn something else!  
  
Got a sell signal on AUDJPY at 17:30 and took it. Got stopped out as it reversed - stupidly I'd ignored the fact that the ADR low was so close, and it bounced almost exactly off the line:  
  
At the same time got a sell signal on AUDUSD and took that too. Again - the ADR low was close - it didn't reach it, but still reversed fairly quickly to hit my SL:  
  
Maybe it's because it's Friday afternoon/evening - is this a bad time to trade?

Hi, Do you all get those audible alerts which comes up in an alert box giving you signals to go long or short as it is a bit perplexing for me.I will get an alert and go and have a look to see if it is viable or not and mostly it is not as it it at times goes against the longer trend.What parameters is it based on or is it something that should be ignored.If it was coded to the parameters of this systems setup it might be possible not to miss those trades that people are speaking of.Anyone who can enlighten me ??????

ultratrend has an alarm function. so if a candle changes colour you get an alarm. this doesn't mean you have a 'full set' of signals. but it's a good heads up to check.   
  
Athravan i only use this on GU and EU...EU being my fav. and yes take note of ADR, still enter but maybe be quicker to exit if bet goes against you.

i tend to go for round numbers or previous lows on a higher TF. remember not to get to greedy though. give yourself 5pips off the low etc.  
as humans we always see the wrong picture..you might catch 25pips but the full move goes 40. we don't celerbrate the 25, we regret not getting the full 40. it's just as important not to loose. if you have a bet and it goes +7 then START to consider moving to BE. yes you will loose a couple, you will BE a lot, but you will win a fair few.

Hi Kraven  
  
Just another word of encouragement.   
  
The last few weeks have been trending strongly so this method like many has done well. I had a look at GU 2 recent periods when price went generally nowhere, 5-16 April and 4-10 May.  
  
When good moves happened it pretty much caught them and the downside was limited, you can't ask for much more than that.  
  
All the best.

I agree Vantage. I back checked before releasing this system on here and when we have a consistant trend we will catch it with little downside (as we will not be entering counter trend unless 4hr changes).  
  
In flat periods again we take 4hr direction, and enter using 15m. So even if the 4hr is flat we still have movement potential on the smaller TF. with smart MM, moving to BE and setting realistic TP's you can still do well.  
  
It's a sound system. as good as anything out there and better then most.

Hi Kraven, nice works.....  
Have you implement this system into your Live Acc trade?  
  
I would give my thought here for Take Profit.....If this system can produce 95% hit rate on just 15 pips (with Max TP 20 pips).....We could take 2 trades simultanously using correlation EU-UCHF at one time.....That 30 pips a day and 600 pips a month.....you can add 1 more pair like EJPY.....and that would be 900 pips a month (of course the time to trade is after London Open).....![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

And, behold, with every hardship comes ease:

yes i'm using an old live spreadbetting account now.  
  
although the results have been fantastic. I don't think i've recorded a loosing day. I'm still apprehensive about putting to many positions on, plus the acount i'm using is small. But i see your logic.  
I realy want to see a big choppy situation...maybe we have had one but the system keeps us out e.g. yesterday morning asian session, that's why i incorporated the higher TP for trend.  
  
I'm in EU now, wanted to bail for 20 and have missed 2 chances..should have put in an auto tp, have now...ended up with +5

hi kraven, do you have an EA that you use? This seems like a fairly easy system to determine entry.

No unfortunately i don't have an EA. An EA would be handy however although this system gives clear indication as were to enter I also advise judgement on your own behalf. there was _NEARLY_ an entry on the EU today but because the move from the red arrow to the low of the entry candle was close to 70pips I wouldn't have entered

Took two more trades today:  
  
EURUSD - sell order for +5 pips (see first red arrow in middle of screen below)  
  
USDCHF - buy order for +5 pips (see first green arrown in middle of screen below)  
  
I've gotten a grip of the Ultrasignal and FXUltratrend indicators should they go wrong in the future.  
  
However, they make the visualisation so easy - no sense in changing them!!

Athravan neither of them should have been entries. the entry was the bottom and top of the next candles, that when your dots appear. the price didnot pass either of the entry candles so there was no entry.

looking for buys now on EU. entered one this morning SL 23, ended up at BE (it went about +15). Re-entered later but the SL was going to be 35 in a tight range, instead entered about todays open .2572 with a SL of 16, we'll see what happens

Kraven  
  
.2572 was not a buy signal since it was not after the break of the signal candle but on the middle of the signal candle, right?

see my last post didn't get on due to high volume on site.  
  
as i mentioned migmac the real entry would have been 35pip SL, in a tight range with yesterdays high, todays open inbetween and some news coming out. so I improvised a bit. i'm at BE now, bet went +30 i have tp of +40 (.2613ish)

That would be the Ultra-Signal which is attached to Kraven's second post.

Dear Kraven. In the first post you wrote that we only enter the trade when the trend is up on 4h for example and on 15 m arrow is green, candles r green and dots are green. I think while posting some profitable trades that you had you entered at the time when it was not ok to enter by the trading rules. Yes the trade was profitable but the dots were red and candle was green for example. Can you please explain why you entered or at what times can we enter the market or for best results we just have to wait for everything to be just one color. I hope you understand what I mean. Thank you.

I still think it's an exceptional way to trade if you want clear entry signals trading with medium term trend. I haven't managed to be around to get into many trades this week but the indi's don't re-paint and back testing is easy. I was keeping an accurate paper trade going but stopped.  
on the GU we have an entry at 8:45 and another at 15:45 (although this candle is to big for me at 35 SL so I wouldn't enter there)  
On EU I thought we would have an entry arrow at 14:45 as we had a pullback that went right to the dots (i was watching and was tempted to enter at the break of the candle but didn't, shame).

I think since the market is ranging its harder to get clear signals and more pips from the market. Now we can see the difference with this system between when the market is in clear trend or ranging. I hope market will find a trend soon and we'll be back to normal trading ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1). Because there is even less signals during the trend, realize how many signals appear right now on 15m during flat market on 4h.  
  
I think when market will start reversing and we will see an up trend, if we will, we might have a long ride up, we can bank a lot of pips.

I like to use some sense when it goes flat. We can see now that the 4hr dots are flat e.g something like the last 30 4hr dots have ranged between them about 23 pips and wev'e had a few colour changes.  
  
When i enter on the 15min I look for small SL's which i move quickly to BE

For such scenario, is a plus to use broker with lower spread. I have 3 pips on eur/usd and 4-5 pips on gbp/usd thinking to transfer to [oanda](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile").

Mine is 1 for EU, 2 for GU at GKFX (don't recommend them though as their execution is terrible)  
  
Just thought I'd post to show how I approach flat trading....remember it how **I** approach it.  
  
I look for smaller entry/SL. and as i've mentioned a few times before move to BE pretty quick, about 5-8pips in profit. If you look at EU and GU today you will see the trades that 'fly' tend not to come back after moving 5-8pips.  
  
If there's an entry that's big I don't enter, I wait for a pullback and a small candle to be 'broken'. If that doesn't happen and it 'rockets' then tough, i missed it.  
  
If you go to post 296 you will see I talk about the pullback to the dotted line. in the pic i show some.  
  
The pic is GU, yet the same concepts can be applied to the EU. looking for small candles to enter..about 15 pips max. Infact the EU was the last i entered at 14:30, SL was 15, I bailed with 30 yet it ran 60. I had one other bet (1st yellow one shown on pic) where i lost 3 pips.

Kraven thank you so much for your last post with picture. You just opened my eyes on something I didn't know that I didn't know ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1).  
  
What I thought is that if there is a signal for long for example and you are waiting for a candle break even if you have to wait for 5 candle bars, I thought if there is no break on second candle bar then forget about the trade. And on pullback you opened my eyes. Thank you so much. You mentioned few times about 3 profitable trades in a row when I had a loss and no trade and I thought how were you able to make profit out of those trades. Now the picture is more clearer to me, thank you Kraven ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)... Im still testing it and when I will be more braver with this system I will be trading 200 lots per pip ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1) so I will only hunt for 40 pips a week and rest the rest time ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)...

yes i would have, but all these entries happened so close to 1.5550 area so I'd be extra careful  
  
in your pic first entry is the red candle with green arrow..it went about 8pips so i would be at BE.  
next little red candle + green arrow, sl about 9pips it went 9pips so BE  
  
after that my charts abit different to yours, in the last one you circled my my green arrow is on the next candle along which wasn't quite broken.

well done driftwood, looks like you enter the same trade as me. I have just bailed at 1.5647 (near RN). because entry was big i played it like this...next candle retraces slightly before breaking above the entry candle, the retrace of that candle (+ a pip or so) is now my SL. One it goes about 8pips set to BE, as it shoots away it doesn't retrace.

Kraven did you mention anywhere in this thread which is the best time to use this system for example London open or US that way we catch few signals, we escape fakeys, we won't have to watch the screen 24 hours non stop. Any ideas?  
  
Im changing my broker to 1 pips spread and will be avoiding ranging periods to be on the safer side.

well the best time to trade is always london open to close as it's the most active. However there is no way to avoid fakey's no mater what system or strategy you use. if you could then you would have the 'holy grail' as you would never loose, you'd be the riches guy on the planet.   
You always get traders asking 'how do we avoid losses', the answer is you don't, you accept them. this is why traders move from one system to another and never get anywhere because they can't take a hit.

Yes Kraven I agree with you, my point was to escape fakey's as much as possible which means we can change the system or time here and there.  
  
I often see sell signal on one candle and when next candle builds up there is a buy signal even tho it was a break candle. So like I mentioned before, before trading on live account I want to be as much comfortable as possible ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

again it would be london time, the busiest time, so if you get a signal hopefully high volume will follow. however you'll still get false signals at anytime and the chances are the signal candle/SL will also be bigger at this time.  
The art is to take as many as you can (with some trading sense).

Thanks Kraven for sharing your system. I have been following it with interest from when you first posted it. I have been waiting for a ranging period to see what it would do, so thanks for addressing that now that we were in one. It would be great if someone would be able to make an indicator/ adjust the current one to show the long term trend in the same window as the 15M to make backtesting easier. I would like to look more in depth into what to do in ranging periods. Looks like the system performs beautifully in trending markets.

With low spread like Kraven has it's safe with ranging periods but I have 3 pips spread on eur/usd and 2 extra pips makes a big difference. Means I have to move my stop higher 2 pips and when Kraven is at break even I will be in 2 pips loss at least.

When did you get the signal? I don't see it on my charts. I had one a while ago.

For the sake of learning: Kraven, how would you have traded this? H4 trend is long.  
Have I got the entry and SL points right?  
The way I understand it, there might be one BE, one loss and one no entry because of too long candle (for the time of day - Asian session)?

yes it was a few hrs ago. I switched my charts off but I've set to BE and TP so don't know how it's gone...or going?  
  
Jostein your chart looks good, don't forget a pip or 2 above candle for the breakout. First entry looks like 1:1 or BE, seconds an unlucky loss by about 2pips, the last looks to big for me.

Kraven I have a question about this trade. Looks like your take profit was set at 4h resistance is that correct? Its 2 pips close to round number. Why wouldn't you make your TP 5690 and be sure it hits ur target because sometimes it won't touch it by a pip or two ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1). Please explain. Thank you...

Brother I just found one simple thing that we can to do escape entering the bad trade. You wrote enter the trade when candle break 1-2 pips but most of the time when there is a bad trade there is still brake occurs as low as 1 pips never seen 2 pips so far so I wanted to take in consideration that and follow these trades and enter the trade after 3 pips brake. We can get 1 pip less from market but that 1 pip will make so much difference and keep us from non profit trades. Any suggestions?

possibly pipmaker. I like to enter when I can. like i mentioned before..  
  
"just quickly switched on charts..see there is a posible EU set-up happening. I'll get in if it breaks. but i'll put a big TP on of around 70pips+...and see what happens??"  
  
well on this trade i set a pending order and i got stopped out for -16 (tp was just under 1.27100). however I re-entered at 10am and put my SL under the RN, same TP which just got hit.  
  
I didn't trade the GU but the entry was at the .57000 area so i thought it was best to stop out.

I got the EU as well. Also had the SL a couple pips under the RN. I didn't move SL when I was in profit by 10-12 pips as I felt the RN provided some support for it to take off some more. Bailed for 25 pips - should have left half to run I see....

Jostein that was the same thinking as myself with the RN giving some SL protection. however i **would** have moved to BE I just didn't set it up.  
once the third candle found some support there it gave me some confidence in the trade.

Check this thread out, it is the same system we are using here but this guy is not just following the arrow signals, he has some other indicators that he uses that system, maybe it is your friend Kraven that gave you this system ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1). There is something we can use to avoid false signals using his method.

pipmaker this guy only started posting this 11 days ago so the chances are he got most of the indi's off this thread.  
  
the added indi's may keep you out of some bad trades but it's likely to keep you out of some good ones and also get you in late on some too, making them bad.unfortunately you can't avoid false signals. no matter what you do. you really need to realise this, i wish you could but then you'd have the holy grail.  
  
remember, the added indi on my system is trading with the 4hr trend.

No pipmaker keep the link on. I'm fine with that.  
  
And i don't mean to lecture. I just want anyone reading this who maybe fairly new to trading to realise as quick as possible that nothing is perfect. no trading style or system. And the quicker traders come to terms with that, the less time they'll spend searching, the more time they'll actualy have trading and learning.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/270c-fe0f.png?v=15.1)

think of it this way...  
  
we use an indi, something simple like a 20SMA. why 20? why not. now we pick a timeframe....15mins. buy if price is above, sell below.now this would work great if **everyone** used it. but they don't. others use 21sma, 10sma, 50sma...13EMA, 21EMA...21EMA shift2...some use 2, 3 even 20 different MA's crossing...on a 1hr or a 4ht TF on different brokers.  
  
Now thats only a few variations using MA's..what about stoch's, RSI, MACD..and what settings do we use RSI 3, 7, 21??, how about Stoch and RSI and look for divergence too.now we have turtletrading channels, colour filter...Ultra Signal (lol)  
  
The variation's of indicators is huge.  
  
candle patterns too, different brokers have different candle finish times..also you look for a candle pattern on a 1hr chart...that pattern doesn't exist on any other TF at that time.  
  
All i'm doing by putting this system here is giving a very good way of entering a higher TF's trend, using a lower TF. if the trend truely is our friend then using a lower TF to follow a bigger trend is a good way to ride it.

I don't know how to solve your platform issue robuk, but if everything else fails - you can always use a Linear Weighted Moving Average of 84 applied to close. All the dots do is show you when it goes from a negative to a positive slope. For all you who don't have access to MT4 and are stuck with e.g. [oanda](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile") (maybe during work hours or similar), add the CCI 45 and you are all set. It isn't as easy to see the entries, but it does work the same.  
  
Nice entry on E/U from when markets opened last night. Caught half at 12 pips and the rest at 50 pips with SL at break even.

Hi Kraven,  
Eventhough this is my first post in this forum, i am looking it for quite some time. Yesterday I entered a trade in AU. Red dotted line is the entry line and the white arrow indicates the candle which i chose to enter. It went against me, hit the sl. Since you are more familiar with the method could you shed some light.

Nothing to do with the method which had several retraces and opp's to enter the trend during the last few days. More a general trading thing, in and around London close where (tradeable under different methods) reversals to trend often occur.

why did you enter at that candle? you can see the move had already been in play for quite some time, there was no great pullback, just a small retracement when you entered.  
I could understand if you entered on the candle that pulled up to the dots (red candle + red dot + pullback). see my next post for example

GU no bets today, 4hr flat with mixed candles to dots and no entries on 15min however EU has been a good trading pair again today. Nice steady down move on 4hr so sells only.  
I've mentioned before about re-entering when candles pullback to dots. today was a good example.  
first entry I was hasty and lost -17pips, the second I just wanted my pips back and got +16 which was a good call in hindsight, the third (good example of a re-entry to the dots) got me +27 (although the move went over 40) and I missed the re-entry to dots circled

Yes, that was a good entry on E/U. I also entered a bit early in anticipation of a drop from the RN after a very quiet European session. I've taken 2/4 at 16 pips, 1/4 at 39 and 1/4 is still floating.

No entries on E/U or G/U for me today. They had both gone too far when I got on the computer. I tried one entry on U/J, but it didn't go anywhere so I bailed at BE. I see it is setting up again, but as I don't know this pair too well and it looks like most of the move is over, I think I will stay out.

GU flat, slightly up, EU down. when the GU is going one way and EU the other I get extremely cautious. I entered last GU signal, when it hit .57000 straight to BE, which is what I got stopped at.

some great entries on GU and EU, enough pips for the week. ON EU +20pips from 8am signal, then re-entry at 12:30 (12:00 candle hit dots but didn't break) out for +105   
GU entered 12:45, made SL 20 up 67 and still in but ready to exit as SL now at +60

running a nice profit from the EU entry (sl15 up +60) and i'm in on the GU, thought it had broke yesterdays lows and the .5500 area but it hasn't so am adjusting sl from 22 to 15. as it'll prbably bounce back  
  
*as i type EU hit tp of +70.

thank you Vantage.  
  
I actualy sold myself short on the EU as it's continued further but it's Friday I'm happy with what I got. I was tempted to leave it open, I have noticed **most times** the Sunday gap follows Fridays direction.  
  
Although the GU would have stopped me out at my original SL22 (just) it has continued following the 4hr trend down (shame, a pip or 2 can make all the difference)

Just watched this go about +10 pips so i went to BE which has just been hit at 2190. still feel this could bounce back down from here but don't want to give any pips back today.

I just want to thank you for this brilliant set up.  
I have been using with much success specially in scalping 5 min  
I love how everything is just obvious.  
For new traders to this set up I am going to post my chart.Notice how price  
for 6hrs stayed under red dotted line which is basically a moving average (50 MA matches closest and looks like it smooths out a bit).  
No set up is perfect but I feel confident on this one.  
  
I am going to post my results after few weeks and account statement.Hopefully I can succeed since this is just brilliant in my opinion.

Kraven,  
Have you ever gone live with this? Even on a micro account?  
I'm going to start demoing it on 1H TF, using Daily trend as the filter.  
  
Will let the thread know how it goes. 

Disregard all prognostications.

Kraven  
I am glad you are around.Picked up +80 pips shorting GU on live account so far outstanding.  
I am however little more aggressive.I don't wait until candle break+1pip by then the meat of the move is gone.  
For example entries closer to trend line rewards most pips.  
Just for rookies No system is perfect.I still use my Fib lines.Chart my own S/R levels hence this system is used only to reinforce my outlook.So far trend line is very powerful.Closest MA to this is 50MA and I am impressed how accurately it bounces off from it.  
This is ideal system for scalping in ranging market since one could get in and out of position.

Hey guys,  
  
New here, thanks for the post Kraven.   
  
I was trying to backtest this manually on M1 and it stopped letting me go back from July 12, 2012. I wanted to go back to Jan 2012 on M1. However, Every other TF is fine I can go back to Jan.  
  
Any thoughts?  
  
Thanks!

it's just the smaller the TF the less you can go back. it's probably the huge ammount of data it would take for 1m charts to go back a few years.  
  
like a lot of trend systems this performed very well again this week.  
on the 4hr we have been in BUY mode on the GU since the 31/8 and on the EU 5/9.  
Now below is a _**VERY, very rough**_ , quick check on the EU buy entries from the 9th of this month from 7am till 10pm euro time. i basicaly just clicked and dragged to the highest point so all the numbers below are the max possible profit (something we'll never achieve). I just posted this to see what was possible on 1 pair last week.  
  
6th: +23, +20 to 35, +22.   
7th: +178, -18  
10: nothing really  
11: +11, +83  
12: an entry around 16:45 goes to +35 eventualy  
13: -20, -10, +224 (into the next day and still going)

open a 15m chart and add the template, then open a 4hr chart and add template

on the Eu we had one bet today at 14:15 (gmt) nice short SL of 12. took half at +30 (yesterdays high) bailed the rest at +10 as it came down.  
  
GU entry at 13:30 had SL of 20, this one went +30 but i failed to bail and got out for +12 (as it dropped under yesterdays high)

So since charts on lower TF can only go so far back (M15 --> March '11, etc) there is no real way to back test strategies right?

well that allows you to look back about 18months. No system is perfect though.  
  
i didn't trade today. if you were up a nice trade at low risk at 4:15 also a rr: 15/22 pip trade at 15:30.

Does anyone know where I can find the source file for the Ultra Signal indicator Kraven uses on this system. I also use it on a 4 hour system, and I don't want to get up at 3am to put a trade on anymore. I was going to have someone make an EA for me just for the 3 O'clock candle, but I need the MQ4 file.  
  
Thanks Much,  
Freddie

I found it. It's called RitaLasker.mq4, if anyone is interested. It's a LWMA with a period of 80, both of which can be modified from your indicators folder. It seems more stable than most coloured MAs I've used. Good luck with Coloured Candles everyone.

Old thread, but still an interesting read/system.  
  
Roofx, no system will work long term if one isn't disciplined enough to stick to its rules - taking too many (revenge) trades, especially when the market is ranging, for instance. It takes a lot of screen time to develop the necessary patience, confidence, discipline and 'feel' for how price behaves in general and, more specifically, around sensitive areas like pivots, big numbers, etc. Also, it's kind of a bummer to state that this system won't work in the long run, without showing a system that does (I suppose you have one that works in the long run, otherwise you would have quit forex trading already and wouldn't be here, reading this thread and trying to discourage your fellow members of the forexfactory community, would ya?!)... 

95% of the people don't believe 100% they can win, that's why they lose

Hi Kraven,  
  
I am using your indicators on my chart and its a charm. only thing is that it does not alert me/pop up when the trend(Ultra signal) changes? I need to keep monitoring the comp. Too old and eyes are sore![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) Any idea how i can install an alert for this?
