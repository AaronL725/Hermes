Greetings to all traders,  
  
As we know that as beginners, we are often trapped in complicated situations in reading charts so that the hope of getting a profit turns out to be a loss. For that, I advise you to follow the directions of several important indicators and not rely on your own hunches.  
  
I suggest you to use the following indicators:  
  
1\. Awesome  
2\. Fibonacci in the form of Moving Average  
3\. Daily pivots with S / R  
  
Time frame is 1 hour, stop loss is 30 pips and Target is between 30 to 70 pips. Please avoid setting very large daily targets such as 100 pips or greater as this can be a dangerous trap. I suggest that you use Euro / USD or USD / CHF because they are both more stable.  
  
You also have to recognize candle formations before entering. For example, all indicators have given orders to buy, so you need to see whether the market is ranging in the last 3 or 5 hours, if 'yes' then you need to start entry buy at lower support. It will be clearer after you look through the picture.  
  
Please use a Demo account as long as you learn this method or use a small amount of capital to open a position for real account.  
  
Thank you  
Bale

On a light hearted note, as it is a boring Aussie Monday Asian session, and I don't trade Mondays until about 4pm, I think a test to see if you are allowed to even trade currency/forex is if you can't read the first initial post properly! lol....couldn't resist!

This is just an idea that aims to take advantage of the functionality of AWESOME and Fibo so that beginners can avoid losing streaks in transactions. Please use a domo account as long as you try it. Thank you

Sorry I was away, indeed AWESOME has given confirmation to buy but I still have to wait for confirmation from the Fibo retracement and after that I will make a decision. This method really tests patience and that is what is needed to avoid losing and maximizing the profits to be achieved. This USD / CHF pair will provide an initial entry which will give a substantial profit, especially after being followed by a Re-enter signal as in the example of the image that I have shown earlier. Thank you very much for your confirmation.

thank you for replying . Do you find it hard to keep up with the 1h charts while busy/out /at work ? I assume you check the close of all 1h candles . Most movement London and NY

USD/CHF  
Awesome has agreed, but I still have to wait for the Fibo retracement to provide more strength to the initial entry I will take.

Yes you are right I follow every movement in the EU and UC every candle is closed and will pay special attention after AWESOME and Fibo give approval. The situation will be very pleasant if the initial entry appears especially if there is support from UL or LL. Thank you very much

As seen in the image below, all indicators agree to buy, so I just need to wait for the Lower limit to be met to start making Initial entries. Maybe around the NY session.

but WHY do you feel the indication is to go long ? Is it because the Fib lines have now aligned in order, or do you feel the fractional move in AO is likely to strengthen ?  
  
I am not saying you are wrong - just trying to get a handle on your observations. For my part - I don't see any reliable bias at this moment.

As I said before, if AWESOME and Fibonacci have shown the same direction, then I have to see whether it is an Initial entry or not, so I just need to see if there is a Lower limit to wait for or enter right away. I can't analyze charts outside of the indicators I understand. thanks.

Hopefully the EU continues to fall and this entry will become an Initial entry. Unfortunately I was taking a nap when the USD/CHF started to creep up , wait and see

Most likely USD / CHF will make an Initial Entry around 0.9115, because AWESOME and Fibonacci are very supportive

If it becomes true in the next few hours then this Initial entry will be followed by a Re-enter which will be very long and satisfying.

Please are these 2 indicators the same: Awesome and Awesome Oscillator?  
  
Fibonacci in the form of Moving Average - How does this one work? Is this a stand-alone indicator  
and where can it be found?  
  
Thank you for a job well done.

You called that right for sure. In your setup I don't see what you are seeing but I cannot argue with your result. I will set up a couple of additional charts and watch what happens - maybe the penny will drop. :-)

As I said in post # 1, the target is between 30 to 70 pips, but usually if it's an Initial entry then the target can be S3 or R3. Thank you

It looks like the entry should be between pivot and s1 but I don't trade NZDCAD. Thanks

Advice for new users of Metatrader, learn what it means when you sign up for **Community,** it gives you access to hundreds of **FREE** indicators, utilities, scripts, and EA's at <https://www.mql5.com/>  
  
Don't be put off by the "5" plenty there for MT 4  
  
Here is one for a start, Round Numbers. Can you be bothered to waste hours placing Support & Resistance lines on Weekly, Monthly, Daily charts for every pair like they tell you in a Youtube video? Or in that $500 course, you bought?  
  
<https://www.mql5.com/en/market/product/27658>  
  
With this one, you can isolate the 100 numbers to the daily, the 50 numbers to 4 Hour, and the 25 numbers to 1 Hour and lower of course.  
  
Can you tell the difference between S&R? Does it matter? See 3 charts of GBPJPY below.  
  
The next best thing to learn is the **MARKET tab** , and the **Codebase tab** too, right within Metatrader; here you can find the very same **FREE** items mentioned as being on MQL5.com. Use the Free as **Filter** and the **Search** is easy  
  
Good luck ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

This UCHF chart shows that AWESOME won't change easily every time it supports each other with Fibonacci. In a situation like this, our only task is to apply re-entry from the Lower limit. Happy learning for you to get more and more understanding.

Have any of you from Indonesia used the $ 100 [FBS](/brokers/fbs "View FBS Broker Profile") bonus? I tried yesterday, with a capital of $ 100 a profit of $ 15. Unfortunately you can only use 0.01 per entry. This is even a lesson that AWESOME and Fibonacci are a compatible indicator pair.

It's actually very easy, please follow these instructions:  
1\. Open a new EU chart  
2\. Select Moving Average Exponential (EMA) 50, close.  
3.EMA 38  
3.EMA 23  
4.EMA 13  
5\. EMA 5  
Numbers 2 to 5 are called the **Fibonacci retracements** in the Moving Average format  
  
After that,  
click**Awesome**  
  
After that, add **pivot_daily1.ex4** and enter it into the indicator list on your chart. Googling on FF to get it.  
  
It's easy, right?

Fibonacci in the EU is getting more perfect, please prepare your mentally and do a Re-enter only from the Upper limit.  
For those who have not mastered this method, please use a Demo account.

Hi Glorybound,  
  
I already check the template and indi once again but no problem.  
I don't know which part is your problem.  
Awesome and Moving Average are MT4 indi.  
Only the pivot will be added and I already give to you.  
What can I show is the pivot setting in case you need to adjust.  
  
Wish you all the best.

Trades using [FBS](/brokers/fbs "View FBS Broker Profile") bonus money today generate 23% profit. This is a lesson learned that in trading on the forex market sometimes there will be a correction.

> Greetings to all traders, As we know that as beginners, we are often trapped in complicated situations in reading charts so that the hope of getting a profit turns out to be a loss.

Sorry bro, AO indi are created default.  
We cannot change anything.  
  
Maybe you can use CCI.  
They can get similar formation with AO.  
  
Wish you all the best.

Awesome cut 0 upwards, all MAs are in their respective positions, then the price will be stuck at LL aka Lower Low aka the lowest bottom of the last few candles. BUY immediately around this when the price is closed.

Having indicators or no indicator make no different because this all are called Technical Analysis.  
Unless if you are SCAMMER, then the trading can be useless and nonsense.  
  
best or worst is only depends on individual.  
Look like you are newbie and know nothing about trading. 

You do good, Good will come to you. Self deception never succeed.

Sorry Bale, I still don't get what do you mean by an upper limit and lower limit? .. is it the pivot line you refer it as the upper limit and lower limit or is it the high and low of the consolidation range?

1\. Starting Monday 16 Nov 2020, I will give an example of how to apply this method in real trading so that beginners will see how the development of small capital can become large in a month.For example a $ 100 capital will be $ 200 or $ 250.  
  
2\. I will use the $ 100 BONUS money I received from [FBS](/brokers/fbs "View FBS Broker Profile"). So if you beginners also want to use cash then please register for free at FBS or another broker that offers the same program.  
  
3\. Don't try to use cash for beginners who don't have Bonus money from FBS. **Please use a DEMO account.**

4\. I have mentioned all the indicators and how to apply them in the chart, so that all beginners will understand the teaching. This thread is only 6 pages long so it is mandatory for beginners to read from pages 1 to 6 so there is no need to ask very simple basic questions. Please learn to read and learn to understand.

5\. Believe me beginners that I will be very focused on reading political and market news on FF, and will follow the price movements very closely before I give any signal in this thread. That's why I won't have time to answer basic questions.

> Greetings to all traders, As we know that as beginners, we are often trapped in complicated situations in reading charts so that the hope of getting a profit turns out to be a loss. For that, I advise you to follow the directions of several important indicators and not rely on your own hunches. I suggest you to use the following indicators: 1. Awesome 2. Fibonacci in the form of Moving Average 3. Daily pivots with S / R Time frame is 1 hour, stop loss is 30 pips and Target is between 30 to 70 pips. Please avoid setting very large daily targets such...

USDCHF is stable? I sure don't see it. I do however like your use of the trends. I use EMA 15, 30 and 50 in M5, M15, H1 for support and resistance entry once there is some movement in a direction.

A chart will guarantee direction?   
  
Maybe think of your system and you want it to go up before going down. It would be a higher probability of going down if it goes up and touches the EMA or your upper limit.   
  
91380 or so would provide confirmation if it dropped back after getting there. ie the bears are in charge.  
  
My point was that USDCHF is far from stable in my observation. But that can be played as well. Always will have a large corrective move to any large move up or down. Breakouts will have a large correction. I never chase this pair and wait for that big reversal to get on board. But it does hold the EMA's and your limit lines when it does move. Finding the pairs that hold them is important.

I do have the ability to analyze GJ's behavior better than other pairs. That's why I entered at 6.20 this morning because I saw an opportunity for GJ to go up. Unfortunately the conditions weren't so good that GJ just walked sideways and I was forced to close it with a little profit.  
At first I thought the GJ pair was not suitable for beginners so I only gave signals on EU and UCH but it turns out that this thread is followed by experienced traders, so I will no longer hesitate to discuss GJ.  
This pair of GJ is indeed lazy and boring but strangely he is able to run faster than Timo Werner the Chelsea striker, because GJ is able to run 150 pips per hour to 300 pips.

In a few hours I will buy gj because I see that this pair is still determined to move upwards. Indeed, right now he was catching his breath and would soon be flying at almost maximum speed.

if I get this system correctly, you take a trade when the candle stick rests on the lower limit in an uptrend?

Yes, perfect. I love seeing how you understand this method.  
  
The results that I will achieve from the transaction will be the same as the results you will receive on the condition that you also make an entry after I give a call to the GJ pair and also set a target and stop loss.

That's GJ's strength, like biting in a blanket. He moved at unexpected times.

Good day RoshanS. Please what is that information towards the right edge of your chart - the one containing MACD, STR, and EMA? Below it is 1.32426; Spread 16.0, PIPS to open, 517, High to Low, 835, and Daily Av. 1097.0. What indicator is responsible for this date. Just learning and curious to know. Thank you for being so helpful.

Today GJ is a bit tired and it is better for him to rest first to recover his strength.

i think it is a good indicator for beginners to define trends better. it is not repainted and also customizable that we can find a better setting for our trading purposes.

It's too risky to go back in because the timing isn't right. Even though there will be a Lower Low in the New York session, I will not enter again.

Actually, I can also sell from the Upper limit, but I chose to buy because the range is very narrow, only 28 pips, while we have to pay a spread of 5pips x 2 for each transaction. very risky. Thanks

Today we are trying to catch a snapper due to uncertain market conditions. These are the market conditions that GJ loves so much and we hope to be successful.

Our trading method, on average, earns 3,000 pips in 6 months, but that doesn't mean we will earn 500 pips per month. Sometimes it's only 350 pips, 88 pips, 350 pips, 545 pips or 1,230 pips. It all depends on market conditions.

Down arrow means sell and up arrow means buy. Green means winning and red means losing.

There is no single indicator or combination of indicators that will stop you from losing or enable you to win if you do not have the knowledge of price movement to enable you to read the markets with clarity, and this, unless you are some kind of special genius, takes years. To assume that an indicator can provide a short cut to success is as delusional as looking for an off the shelf winning system on the internet. Trial and error based knowledge is the only way anyone can succeed in this business, and losing over and over, not trying to avoid losing, is the best way to eventually achieve it.

Bale why you took longs? Indicators show SELL. Did your broke or change your rules?

I agree and disagree. If you know what the indicators are telling you, then they can be used to trade off. A simple moving average for example can tell not only which way a trend is but also its rate of movement. A stochastic can give you a low risk entry point if used in conjunction with the trend. Just one example.   
You are right in that you need to study and try these things out as really there is more than one way to trade. Could go on but time is of the essence.

The indicator does not belong to me it belongs to MetaQuotes.  
Therefore I do not want to pass on an indicator that I have changed 4me. How you can adapt it for yourself is described above. Very simple, takes only a few seconds.  
I use the indicator only for my own use. Have fun.

Starting from today I have made a few changes and you will see the results in the next 10 days. If the results are good then I will share them. Again, I remind you to use **a demo account** as long as you follow my method until you feel confident.

I call this new method " The Cowboy Method" because of its principle of chasing cows from the backs and herding them into the pen. My hope is that with this Cowboy method, we can get 200 to 300 pips in a week.  
In a few hours this method will be in action.

Rules that need to be followed:  
1\. The first target is S1 or R1 or a minimum of 30 pips.  
2\. The second entry target is of course S2 or R2 to R3 in a very trending market condition.  
3\. Stop loss is -30  
4\. Apply Locked profit +2 during **the first transaction** to protect your account.  
5\. Never try to stop a train even though the price has entered the area for entry.

For that, I advise you to follow the directions of several important indicators and not rely on your own hunches. I suggest you to use the following indicators: 1. Awesome 2. Fibonacci in the form of Moving Average 3. Daily pivots with S / R Time frame is 1 hour, stop loss is 30 pips and Target is between 30 to 70 pips.

By looking at the positions of all indicators, it can be concluded that the EU will also rise in the near future.

A safe place to start shooting is between the tall grass, at 1.1849 to 1.1862. Watch out, so you don't fire now, okay? The target is of course the farthest cattle market on R3. SL 30 pips

Prepare your horses, we will try to escort these cows to cross the wide river R1 first before we reach the second river. If we succeed in crossing the river R3 then I will buy you a free bier and grilled meat ..

Sir idiot,KopraTasa....lmao...  
  
i dont know if you were trying to sound "cool",or "clever" but the more you talk the more i realise how clueless you are.  
  
Go learn from the bankers/pple who create the market and trade large volumes,pple who actually hold the majority of the FX bag,they will all tell you how useless all those macds ,ichomukos,moving averages etc are!  
  
Everytime they line up and tell your idiotic pompous self its ok to buy/sell the market makers pullback and or consolidate.(70  
% of the time).  
  
I dont expect you to understand me at all....after all you are just and average joe trading some account equivalent to some guys lunch money out there.  
  
So take a breath and respect your elders.Been doing this since you were an inch in you daddys pants.  
  
Go find some average dick head to play with.  
  
Most of the retail traders are hard headed,learn from each other and think you the best thing since slice bread...and none of you are holding large impactful volumes or participation in the markets...let alone make any impacts in your life using trading....  
  
Meaning,the banks hold the majority of volume,yet statistically they constitute the minority in numbers of paritcipants...On the other hand the retail sector holds a large number of pariticipants and very little volume....so why in the heck would anyone in their right mind learn,take advice or take notes from the no money participants.-doesnt make sense at all.  
  
If you think i am talking bullshit,PLEASE PLEASE show me indicator that has made you a consistent trader AKA helped you minimise losses!!!(ill be waiting).  
haha,some flipping idiots in here.shaking my head(lmao).  
  
So Traopaza...you are the one who woke up this dragon,how do you like me now!!!?  
  
Bears make money,Bulls make money-and the pigs get slaughtered...Gordon G.

Unfortunately the distance is too short to buy from the pivot

Why in those 9 days, only the best 2 days for entry? Newbies will see a new method of transacting with GJ, EJ and AJ to be able to generate profits on time.

Why did I choose to trade only with these 3 pairs? Because they often make happy surprises.

It means that in the period 7-11 Sept 2020 only GJ gave a happy surprise, EJ donated a little and AJ was just silent. So why do I still use AJ for transactions? Because there are times when this pair goes crazy alone, leaving its competitors far behind.

Hahaha, of course I'm just kidding, what I mean is GA and this pair is one of our mainstays in future transactions. Let you see how great GA is in making profits in the same period.

We will focus on transactions on **GJ, EJ and GA.**  
  
Starting tomorrow we will focus on getting 150 - 200 pips per week from these 3 pairs.

GA will prepare for a duel and indeed this one enemy is a bit tough. I've never been able to shoot his shadow, but he's also required to give a minimum of 150 pips this week.

I don’t think there is anything like the best indicator for beginners. The one that suits your trading requirements the best is obviously the best one for you.

Hello dude, I've taught about all the required indicators and how to apply them, and repeated it many times.  
  
There is no need to teach the same things over and over to a beginner who just comes without going through the first page. Thanks

It seems that the economic news that will be released today will press GA, so I will sell GA for today.  
  
Unusually, I want this thread to be more active in asking questions about why I made the decision to sell or buy and why I set a target at a certain price, so I will trade on a 4 hour time frame instead of daily.  
  
Each candle changes, I will have the option to continue or close the current transaction, so those of you who are interested in participating can do it on 4 occasions.

We have to be careful because in less than an hour the bad news of Astralia will be out, so we have to prepare to buy GA .  
Check market conditions:  
1\. The news will be bad, the effect of GA will go up.  
2\. The EMA14 indicator is already below the EMA5, the effect is that GA will rise.  
3\. H1 price is trying to go to the pivot, the effect is GA will go up.  
4\. I am mentally good, the effect is I will win this transaction.

Yes, you are right, this transaction is the first time today until 09 am, and there will indeed be a whipsaw after the NY session. Thank you for your comments

Cowboy members should recognize this formation as a starting point for buying. Watch for the previous hummer in a bullish condition as a signal from other buyers to enter.

In a bearish situation, after the first transaction is closed at least +50 pips, then we will wait for the Morning Star to appear to carry out the second transaction.

Is this a proper entry for buy? There is a slight range and the indicators line up. Thanks!

It turns out that GA is perfect for Asian traders because the time is suitable for trading on a 4 hour time frame.  
  
As you can see from the morning, the first result I got was +53, the second result was -36 and the third result was +105.  
  
Total +122 pips for today.

The first GA transaction has generated +84 pips, and I still have another chance to open a new transaction. This week, GA has contributed more than 200 pips, thank you GA.

GJ H4, be careful with GJ's moves on H4 today, he can boil alive the results we've gathered.  
But, there is a great opportunity for entry when the NY session opens tonight.

Cowboys, I purposely train you to read charts so you can predict the market by uploading as many charts as possible when I open a transaction. I hope that you are increasingly able to read it so now rarely ask questions. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)

You are right, when I took the transaction, EMA5 was still> EMA14 on TF H4. If I wait for a new candle to open, it means I will miss the train because Big News will come out in 1 hour aka 07.30. That's why I saw the situation on H1 TF because the previous night I won 105 pips and there is no way that GA will make a correction in the situation Big News will come out in 1 hour. Incidentally, the price is slightly above the pivot, which means I will take a short position with the S2 target. Why Short? because the news for Australia will be good. Proven right? I got another +84 pips

GA and GJ are 2 crosses that we really rely on to contribute 200 to 300 pips every week. But between the two, GJ is sometimes a bit naughty because it often makes corrections when the profit is still around 60 pips and it will make us disappointed. To outsmart it, when we transact with GJ for the first time (there are 3 opportunities in 24 hours) then we can close the transaction when the profit reaches +50 or at R1 / S1.**Please don't forget this secret** , and we will continue the transaction at the opening of the next candle.

I also have pivot points on my charts but just to identify if the price is high or low, nothing else. Not to directly trade them, well because i've seen couple of expanding markets piercing through all the resistances or supports of the day in couple of hours and expanding hundres of pips away from them, so how would that make any sense to buy Support 4? or sell the highest resistance directly etc.  
  
Thanks in advance.

I totally agree with your comment, the S / R pivot is only an indication of where the price will start moving and where the possible limit will be.   
  
Due to the reason I sold GA yesterday from around the pivot, it was only because the price happened to be around the pivot when I had to enter because News would be out in 30 minutes. Thank you

> Greetings to all traders, As we know that as beginners, we are often trapped in complicated situations in reading charts so that the hope of getting a profit turns out to be a loss. For that, I advise you to follow the directions of several important indicators and not rely on your own hunches. I suggest you to use the following indicators: 1. Awesome 2.

Cowboys,   
I will practice my sharpness in shooting skills using a **EuroH4** type gun. While the market is quiet.  
If you are interested then I will be happy to teach you.  
This method can also make 200 to 250 pips a week.

Please explain - Aqua being bigger than yellow, do you mean aqua being above the yellow line?

Even though I have taught you how to enter and take the first profit, I will still give the signal if I take a transaction. Only in this way will we get the same pips result.

It seems I answer questions politely and never get angry, but only 2 people asked me.  
  
Remember, if you often ask questions then you will also be able to fish and be independent one time later, don't just want to be given fish.  
  
In this cowboy thread I love to answer questions and the question and answer will keep you active because I am preparing you to earn 200 - 300 every week. That's what happiness means to me, helping as many people as possible to make money according to their needs.

Thanks bro, I am happy to see your comments and I agree that we cannot force other people to ask. That's why I'll keep on providing signals.

This gun can be used for other pairs, thank you. All markets are lazy to move because they are waiting for news.

So the entry can only be made when the price pulls back to the ema5?

We must get in the habit of analyzing all the achievements we have made in live trading as correction material for wrong transactions and as things that must be repeated for positive results.

From 30 Nov to 4 Dec we only use 2 currencies to transact, they are GA and EU pairs.  
  
As our target for each currency pair they must contribute 150 pips to 200 pips in a week.  
  
Did they fulfill their obligations?

If GA or the EU succeeds in fulfilling its obligation to contribute 150-200 pips a week, then we must respect these two currencies. We must read 5 times back and forth about the news about both of them in the FF calendar about the events that will occur and adjust it to the strategy we have mastered.

GA managed to complete its task by giving +206 pips and it was very happy.

The EU also managed to complete its task successfully and gave a return of 270 pips. A very proud achievement.

Hi Balle Can you please clarify the entry rule of circled candle, here EMA5 is already above EMA13.

Good question, this was live trading a few days ago. When I took the decision to sell, it was still influenced by the previous conditions where I won 105 pips, and when EMA5 and MACD gave a signal, I immediately sold. Another consideration at the time was that Australian news would come out good while Poud's news was bad. Thanks.

In addition, EMA5 and MACD 121 are very ideal pairs and they both react very quickly to all changes that occur in the 4 hour time frame.

Sometimes the market is preparing to satisfy us and fortunately we use this method to take all the profits the market provides.  
  
Similar to the condition where someone is trying to fish next to you who is fishing with a net.  
  
Take a look at this market.

In this market condition, the Euro alone has contributed 300 pips in a week, what about the additional pips from GA and GJ? You will be proud of your own ability to make a profit.

In this condition we need to monitor the pair continuously instead of looking it 4 hourly.

Yes, we should still monitor price movements so we can get out around 50 pips on the first transaction of the day {please check the rules}

I have read the news about the Euro next week, 3 times back and forth, I hope that we will have an encouraging result of between 200 and 250 pips from the EU next week.  
  
Don't forget to limit tp to 50 pips for the FIRST transaction every day, aka the first candle of 5 candles, ok?

GA will also try to provide the best for us. We hope to earn between 150-200 pips from this pair next week.

We must pay attention to the movement of Cable because this is the center of the forex market movement. Hopefully we can also get 150 -200 pips from GU next week.

Congratulations, I just focused on the EU earlier and I didn't realize that there was a signal in GU.

I also lost -22 pips because I only focused on EU, and I didn't realize that there was a signal in GU.

You're absolutely right, I should have followed the signal in GU. I am too complacent about the EU results so far.

Bro, I've given all the secrets about this strategy, there are 10 rules that must be followed, and I've also shown how to transact based on this strategy. When I make a profit of 50 pips, 105 pips or 84 pips I accept it happily and when the time comes to lose 22 pips I also accept it gracefully. So if we have entered according to the rules and it turns out the market is against the direction, then we have to accept it. That's what we use a stop loss for.   
  
The only way not to lose real money is to use a demo account. Thanks.

I Hope you guys get used to reading the news and see how it affects the pairs you will take. We already have clear entry rules, stop loss and target, so you can enter without fear as long as it follows the rules of this method.

The best indicator is you! You should learn some price action and everything will change.  
Why will you use indicators? Indicators are delayed price action... if you learn price action. you will be the indicator and you will remove the lagging indicator.

EJ pair, the last 2 candles tend to go down, where EMA 5 is already below Ema 10 and MACD 1,2,1 is below 0. This means that the indicator has given a sell signal so that EJ may be sold if the price returns to EMA5. Please watch the News now, will the Euro news weaken? or the Yen will be strong? Newbies should use a demo account.

Wondering why you missed the GBP drop? The insiders, hedge-funds, and political elite already knew the drop was coming. Look at my chart and you can see the setup completely. The un-trained eye can see beyond using a ton of indicators. You really think the Central Banks not telling their friends which way they will move the market. You better think again. You really think they trade on M15,M30,H1,H4 timeframes. No, they trade on information before the world knows. You can track their footprints on offline charts. I use the M10.

You have nice template but believe me it is the mindset which takes you to profitability. Would you mind sharing how you scan pairs to trade, what are the rules you are considering while opening and closing the trades.

Im sorry but my template will not be shared. I spent quite some time understanding coding to perfect my cloud indicator. The other indicator is available freely which is TMA-CG by Mladen. I will just post which direction the market is headed for three pairs I focus on. GBPUSD,EURUSD, and GOLD.

See how the Elite and Insiders already knew the news before the world. Better understand how this game is played or get left behind. Smart Money have eyes and ears in every government. There's no fair play when trading; all about the money grab from government Central Banks....

ok, I personally don't think it's nice, because we're all here to support each other, but everyone has to know how and what they are doing themselves. But then I hope that you can be asked questions, for example i have one, what kind of cloud is that on the chart, is it Ichimoku?

I understand. Trading is not fair. If so, everybody would be Millionaires. I have given this forum plenty free systems over the years. Check under systems and you will see how much I gave. This system will only be given to private lessons to serious traders. However, I'm giving free market direction to help beginners least make a buck or two.

Leave him alone, he just wants to make himself important and unfortunately there are a lot of them in this forum, what he posted is nothing special and maybe he just wants to lure people to do something else, we have already had that here very often.

3 The market is ranging, so the entry from the EMA4 after MACD 2,3,1 agrees, with a target of 20-25 pips and sl 23 pips. This condition usually occurs during Asian markets.

4\. The market is trending, so after 50 pips is reached you can add lots and the next target is 40-50 pips. This condition occurs after the London market opens until midnight Jakarta time.

Hello Bale,  
  
I am a beginner trader living in France. I am reviewing your different methods of trading which I find very instructive. I am currently trying to elaborate a trading system with a reasonable win rate, but I am hesitating between scalping trading, day trading, swing trading or a mix.  
  
I can see that you trade in one hour time frame which can be considered as day trading (with Awesome and Fibonacci in the form of Moving Average indicators) and also scalp (with EMA and MACD indicators)(which time frame?).  
  
As a beginner, what advice would you give me in terms of starting trading scalping or day trade? Are your methods applicable with commodities and indices? Are they successful in long run without adding any other technical analysis?  
  
Regards

The advantages of scalping are a small stop loss and we can even exit if the last candle is engulfed.

Hi pegase, As a beginner, I suggest that you trade on M15 and for the time being you can follow all the signals from me until you can do it yourself. Only in this way can you learn well. Regards,  ,

Hi all  
I think the Saturation Zone Indicator is a great indicator for both newcomers and professionals.  
And I got very good signals in combination with price action.  
I take the image of my analysis of Gold H4 with this indicator, the super trend indicator (for candle power) and master trend indicator (for predicting candles movements) are also in the chart.

For that, I advise you to follow the directions of several important indicators and not rely on your own hunches. I suggest you to use the following indicators: 1. Awesome 2. Fibonacci in the form of Moving Average 3. Daily pivots with S / R Time frame is 1 hour, stop loss is 30 pips and Target is between 30 to 70 pips.

you are right. My observation is that it is not a valid setup to take a trade. Moreover below 4hr TF nothing works.
