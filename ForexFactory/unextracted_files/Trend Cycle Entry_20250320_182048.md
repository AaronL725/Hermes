So many years away and now returning as a mature trader. I read a couple of my old posts/replies and realize the journey. In my time away, I developed various systems, turned charts into bowls of spaghetti and traded naked charts as well. I developed intricate indicators that use the same data every indicator uses - price and time. I failed, I learned, I failed, I learned. I stopped failing. After a period of success and at the request of friends, I jumped through all the government and financial regulatory hoops and founded an alternative investment firm - A CTA (Commodities Trading Advisor) firm. I used my, now proven method and made some rich people richer. I also hated the business. So I exited and returned to my home office, my sanctuary, and independent trading.  
  
My method is not sophisticated. I use a few standard indicators with no customization. I have a few iron-clad rules and I follow them without fail. With this method, I do not trade everyday (I have others for intraday trading) but the method I will describe is what I used to build an incredible business and it is still my priority method for creating the majority of my income. I call it "Trend Cycle Entry".  
  
The below chart is a Daily.  
Indicators:

  1. Heikin Ashi Candles
  2. 15 period EMA (White)
  3. 50 period SMA (Green)
  4. Bollinger Bands - 20/2 (Blue)
  5. StochasticRSI - Stochastic=10, K=3, D=3, RSI=13 (Lower Pane)

The trade is to wait until the 15 EMA crosses the 50 SMA. Once this happens, you are waiting for a reverse cycle (a retrace) in which the candles move to the opposite Bollinger Band and then disconnect from it. The 15 EMA needs to retain separation from the 50 SMA. The StochasticRSI also needs to be the opposite cycle of the preceding price action (above/below 80/20) - again, first cycle in unison with the price action. The trigger candle is the one that changes color from those of the retrace upon its close. The entry is on the open of the following candle.  
  
Rules:

  1. Only the first cycle after the cross is executed - 2nd and 3rd cycles are more risky
  2. Price must intersect the BB
  3. Price must disengage from the BB
  4. Separation maintained by 15 EMA and 50 SMA
  5. Candles must change from green to red / red to green
  6. StochasticRSI must be in its first cycle above or below 80/20 OR crossing 80/20 in support of the trade direction.

The trade furthest to the Left (White arrow) on the chart is an example of a long trade entry:

  1. 15 EMA crossed up over 50 SMA
  2. Price retraced and intersected the BB
  3. Price disengaged the BB
  4. That candle remained green. The next candle closed red
  5. Stochastic RSI below 20% and rising
  6. Good MA separation

I entered at the open of the candle following the closed red candle. I ran a trailing stop that I tightened as the trade progressed. Closed for 528 pips. The other arrows are shorts.   
  
I couple of the example trades occurred on the 2nd cycle of the StochasticRSI. This goes against the "first cycle" rule and is a slightly riskier trade. But I shown them as examples anyway.  
  
I'm not in this forum every day but I will answer questions as they arise, when I am here. I do not have MT4 files for this. I use Trading View. I also use these standard indicators because, believe it or not, standard indicators are what most institutional professionals use. The simpler, the better. I don't use stops other than a trailing stop once the trade is in profit.  
  
This method can be used on smaller timeframes. It becomes even more important to follow the rules, respect higher timeframe trends, and expect smaller runs that need to be managed more closely.  
  
Enjoy!

What we need is an alert system or even backtesting arrows like you said and we will see how profitable it is.  
  
You didn't say which tf do you trade? But I think its D1 right? 

Anything above the line is an uptrend, below the line is a downtrend.

I have an alert set in Trading View that tells me when the 15 has crossed the 50. Sends me a text. I have other alerts that tell me when the candles have disengaged from the BB, HA color change, etc. These allow me to know what is going on without having to be in front of charts.  
  
Profitability is a matter of trade exit. Each trade is unique so I determine the exit based on the conditions at the time. But for what it's worth, I have not had a losing trade with this method since I finalized my rule base and executed it - several years ago. Keep in mind, I don't use stops. Definitely not for everyone.  
  
Daily is my TF of preference. But I have adopted it to shorter TFs for occasional day trading if there is nothing else to do (rare).

Hi there,  
  
your strategy seems interesting. I like the simplicity of it. I would like to use this on 4H TF, I hope I don't have to change any settings or anything else. I will let you know how everything goes.  
Also you said you don't like to use stop loss, when will you like to get out of the trade if it is going against you? I know you said you have not lost a trade yet but I guess you will have a back up plan for a worse case scenario.  
  
Thank you for giving back to the community, definitely helps people like us grinding.  
By the way what's up with your name WickedDaddy haha sounds like porn actor's nickname...no offence yeah, just laughs

Thakri,  
  
No changes need to be made for application to any timeframe, so 4HR will work fine. Make sure you pay attention to the higher timeframe trend. It's always best to trade with the wind at your back.  
  
I do have a mental stop that I am comfortable with. It varies based on what is happening in the market. For example; if I have a trade running and some idiot politician says something to manipulate the market, I probably would not care. But if a sudden change to a country's financial position were to occur, I may get out of the trade (if it was going against me) to wait for things to settle down and a possible new direction to be established.  
  
I also view my account as both my money and the market's money. Let's say I opened an account with $100,000. I will not let the account fall below that amount. That is my money. But a few wins increase the account to $110,000. $10,000 is the market's money and I so I set my mental stop within that range. As the account grows, I raise the amount that I consider "mine" and adjust my expectations, lot sizes, and trade aggressiveness accordingly. I am not a good loser. Many traders accept loss as a part of the business. I respect their ability to do so. But I also accept my inability to deal with losses in a positive way. So my only other alternative is to trade based on a method that I have proven to be effective, trade its rules without fail, and preserve "my" capital as it increases.  
  
One of my kids gave me that name. I like building custom cars and motorcycles. Some years ago I had finished a motorcycle that I had painted with flames that had skulls in the flames, all on fire and laughing. My oldest daughter really liked it and said it was "wicked". My other daughter than said, that's because Dad is wicked... They laughed and said "You're a wicked daddy, Dad."

That's a good way to protect your money, I am a bad looser too and it makes me loose more haha I have to be on the winning side as soon as I can.  
  
About higher time frame trend, how do you identify higher TF trend? Market Structure (HH, LL/HL, LH) or 4H TF Ema cross, go down to 1H TF and look for trading setup there? This is simple but at the same time a bit confusing because sometimes I find it stopping me from taking a trade thinking it might reverse on HTF. Any advice would be helpful.  
  
Your name is a bit meaningful then. I am excited to know you like to build custom cars and bikes, I am guessing choppers. I love riding bikes but don't know anything about building them, it would be great to learn that. May one day when I became a trader like you, I will get into learning how to build bikes.   
  
Thank you for replying WickedDaddy

I don't use stops. I do occasionally use a trailing stop once the trade is sufficiently profitable. TP's are unique to each trade. In tight/ranging markets, I'll take small profits and the S/R levels, time of day, trade session, my bedtime, etc., determine my comfort. In well established trends, I'll mostly use a trailing stop but I also will arbitrarily decide "enough is enough" and get out so I can go have fun without thinking about trading.  
  
I don't try to pick tops and bottoms. I'm not greedy. If I feel a trade has made enough money (whatever that is) I'll pull out. Yes, I leave money on the table often. That's fine. Profits are happiness and I don't need that many pips to live the way I want. Sometimes I nail the top and/or bottom and nail the reverse on exit. Those are fun. Sometimes I'll get in something that just refuses to move, I get impatient and pull out while it's profitable, even if by a couple pips. Then wait for a better situation.  
  
I think of trading like a spider. Just sit quietly and let the food come to you.

The higher time frame trend is typically at least 4 times the chart you are focusing on. So, if you are on a 1 HR chart, look at the 4 HR chart for the dominate trend. I don't worry about any indicators on that HTF chart. I'm only interested in the overall direction of the market. If the 4HR chart shows that price is in a downward trend, then I am only looking for selling opportunities on my 1 HR chart. If trading a 4 HR chart, I will look at the 1D chart for trend direction.  
  
The caveat:  
I trade 1D timeframes mostly. I don't need to look at the weekly for reference, although I'll check it sometimes just for reference. Compressing the 1D chart will easily reveal the trend. You can always put a 50 or 100 MA on it if you like and trade according to that: if candles are above the MA, look for long trades. If candles are below the MA, look for short trades. I think you will notice that once price moves above or below a trend line, it tends to stay above or below it for at least a few cycles.  
  
Trading longer timeframes also means allowing more room for the trade to breathe. Sure, you can make a a couple hundred pips in a trade on a 1D chart. But you will also need to get comfortable with 30 to 50 pips of movement either direction on it's way. For some, that is a test of their resolve.

There are not many pairs that RSI will break 20 /80. on Daily. Currently AJ shows a past break - haven't looked further yet. However, WD is not showing the RSI at all so ??? Let's wait and see what his response is. Looks like a very easy relaxed trade method though - I am about to look for a BB break alert etc.

I believe he is using a stochrsi indicator, not a stoch + rsi. Search for a stochrsi and attach that.

Thank you for sharing.  
But there are a few questions you need to explain in more detail.  
1) Indicators  
About 50 moving average mode, is it EMA, SMA, or others?  
Stochasticrsi indicator, is it a special indicator or a standard indicator? If it is standard, how to set it on the chart?  
2) Rules  
Price must intersect the BB -- does the highest and lowest price of a candle intersect the boundary of BB? Or the opening price or the closing price?  
Price must disengage from the BB -- it means that after the previous candle intersects, the next candle reversely separates from the boundary of BB?  
Separation maintained by 15 EMA and 50 MA -- is there a quantitative standard for the distance between two moving averages?  
Candles must change from green to red / red to green-- meaning intersecting candles and disengaging candles color change? Can you mark on the chart?  
3）The trade furthest to the left (white arrow) on the chart is an example of a long trade entry -- "2.price retracted and intersected the BB.", But it doesn't feel intersected? " 4.That candle remained green. The next candle closed red."， It's not clear which candle you're pointing to.  
  
Thanks。

I have attached an example of a GBPUSD trade, as I interpret the instructions. If you take a pair and backtest it visually you will see how it works. A lot of times the piercing of the BB edge will come during a narrowing of the bands (Asian session) setting up the move in the direction of the trend for the London session. Hope this helps.

That's a good looking set-up. Wait for a green candle to close, then enter on the open of the next.  
  
**Important note:**  
  
Today the U.S. Fed releases it's minutes from their most recent meeting. There will be a press conference as well. Regardless of how perfect the set-up looks, I avoid these events and if the market settles down afterward, and conditions are still intact, then I will continue with my trade, but only if the direction is still in favor of the original set-up.

Beautiful. A "textbook" trade executed flawlessly.  
  
As you become accustomed to the process, you may decide that BB intersection is not always necessary. Intersection with the 50 is also a strong set-up but not quite as reliable. I don't support "adjusting" the rules until you really have a feel for it.  
  
Well done!

The Stochastic and the RSI are not exclusive of each other in my method. There is an indicator that combines the parameters of both in a single process. It is the StochasticRSI. It should be readily available on most platforms.  
  
Pakeha posted an MT4 version in Post 22 above. (Thanks Pakeha)

That's what we needed, thank you! 

Anything above the line is an uptrend, below the line is a downtrend.

Nothing to do with this system, but I must disagree.  
  
**RSI** breaking 20 / 80 will depend on the settings.  
  
Try **7** as shown, you might be amazed.

Well, if you want to be picky about it, have another read of Post #1  
  
Specifically the part where he mentions to use **Stochastic-RSI**  
  
And especially study the chart; look at how it oscillates between 20 and 80 constantly.  
  
It was you that first mentioned RSI, so I shared a good setting for that indicator with you.

NO. But I would watch it closely. If you entered at .83500, there would be approximately 20 pips of profit in that trade right now (current price .83284 when I wrote this)  
  
I don't know about you but 20 pips of profit is enough for me on a daily basis. Not counting my long term holds, my daily, intraday goal is 10 pips. For me, that is a comfortable living. But all things considered, that is a small trade.  
  
I think at this point, I may think about putting a break even stop behind it and see where it goes. Worst case, it bounces and you've lost nothing. That said, I like profits so in all honesty, I would probably close it and enjoy the rest of my day doing anything other than trading.

There are a couple issues with this trade.  
  
1\. It seems you are not using HA candles. Conventional candles do not produce the proper response to the rule structure.  
  
2\. The 15 EMA is very close and perhaps intersecting the 50 SMA when the trade was taken. While this is not necessarily a problem every time, it does weaken the strength of the trade. Something to consider. Good separation strengthens the trade considerably.  
  
Looking at the higher time frame (daily), I see that EURCHF has had a pretty good run downward and appears to have formed a base in the 1.0350 area. I would strongly consider that in my decision to short EURCHF at this time.

If it's OK for StochRSI to cross 20 when the candle turns the right colour, it could be a rules-based entry.

Absolutely and actually gives strength to the trade. I'm updating my first post because I failed to mention it.

HA = Heikin Ashi   
  
It's a variation of the Japanese candlestick.

There have been a few requests for how to apply this strategy to shorter timeframes. So here we go...  
  
First, the core rules have not changed. See Post #1 for those.  
  
The shortest TF I will trade is 1HR. Thus, I have included a 1HR chart below with some trade examples in it. Anything shorter is noise and I'm too laid back to stare at 1 minute charts, getting in and out of 2-3 pip trades until my eyes bleed.  
  
For trend reference, I add a 100 SMA (yellow) and a 200 SMA (red) to the chart. The only purpose of these is to provide trend reference. Think of them like a traffic signal: the green 50 SMA completes the picture of "go", "caution" and "stop".  
  
A Note:  
Most of the professional institutional traders that I know use a 1HR chart to determine entry. They use a daily to determine what they want to be in and generally when, then use a 1HR to determine actual entry when making investment decisions. The only purpose of this is an attempt to have the investment producing results immediately. Clients get frustrated when you buy a large chunk of something and it immediately goes negative. So the goal is to build immediate confidence in the investment decision. It can fluctuate later and clients will generally understand if it started out well.  
  
I digress...  
  
You will also notice the yellow line in the pane above the StochasticRSI. That is a 34 SMA of a 13 RSI. Some of you may be familiar with Dean Malone's Trader's Dynamic Index (TDI). This is a piece of that: the 34 SMA of the underling 13 RSI. I noticed some years ago that it crossed its 50% line almost in sync with my 15 EMA/50 SMA cross. Actually, a little afterward. I don't really use it anymore but it does provide a level of confirmation. In earlier years, as I was developing my method, it provided an additional feeling of confidence. I don't have rules around using it. I have actually removed the MAs in the chart and only used this hybrid TDI as my guide and it works well. So the choice is yours.  
  
I have placed a white box around each cross of the 15 EMA/50SMA. The arrow that follows points to the trigger candle that has changed color after the one(s) before it intersected and possibly disengaged from the BB. Often the color changed candle is also the disengagement candle and that is fine.  
  
Remember that one of the rules of the trade is the FIRST retrace cycle only. Second and third cycles are an option but those are more risky and that's up to you. Are you a gambler or a sniper? Do you notice the 3rd cycle after the cross down? Tempting with 3 triggers occurring. That one would have been frustrating and while it ultimately produced, I don't have that kind of patience when it comes profit production. Know thyself.

How do you get large gains, as shown in the first post using a daily time-frame, if you don't hold trades over the weekend? Do you close and re-enter, or something else?

Hi WickedDaddy,  
Thank you for your sharing.  
It seems be not much set up for Daily TF. How many trade you get per month and risk per trade?  
When I back test, I only get about 6 trades per year for E/U pair.

Exactly. I exit on a 1 HR chart on a Friday, sometimes Thursday if I'm taking Friday off or it will be NFP, etc. Then I re-enter on Monday morning or set an entry to trigger during the London open if I think I can get a better price for my continuation.

True, My daily TF trades are few, but I hold them for their extended trends and often add to them as they retrace during the trend. I only trade 3 pairs: EU, AU, and UJ. I choose these based on their direction. When USD is strong, I short EU and long UJ. When dollar is weak, I long AU. This is to take advantage of the carry. Why not get paid to hold a trade open? Ha ha.  
  
These are the trades that pay big and I have large sums invested. They are the core of my income. I think it better to focus expertise on as few things as possible. That way, each get an effective level of concentration and higher level of expertise is gained. During decent trends, I can expect a trade or two a month and hold it for 2 to 3 weeks, then maybe no big trade for a month. In choppy markets, I take more trades but hold them shorter and I also adjust my entry and exit rules accordingly. Keep in mind, I created this system for myself and I have traded it for many years. So I can bend the rules because I've learned when and when not to do so. For those starting out (and this is true with any method) it's best to follow the rules exactly until you get a feel for it.   
  
My only risk rule is how many lots I trade per available cash. Being in the U.S. and having 50:1 margin means that rule designates approximately 12% of available cash to any one trade. I don't use stop loss orders other than trailing stops that are in profit. I have mental stops that if hit, I will close the trade manually. That said, I have no problem applying a Martingale technique to a trade because I still have plenty of available cash. I don't suggest that for inexperienced traders and have very rarely done it myself, but that technique has worked very well for me in the few instances where I deduced that my timing was too early and so I build the trade as it goes against me. Then let it cycle in my direction for an overall profit. Large institutions do this as a matter of general practice. But they can because they have the cash on hand to do so.   
  
I also trade shorter time frames in a separate account so that I can take generate "living" cash - for the normal expenses of daily life, and fun of course.  
  
Trading is my only income and has been since 2014.

7 is indeed a good setting for RSI on the Daily. The only problem is price tends to hangout in oversold or overbought for quite a while.

Two scalps I took this morning. Both for 10 pips each and up 2% for the day. Good stuff! Never been a fan of indicators and always tried to trade with naked charts. Always felt like I should be able to read the charts and know exactly what is happening. Using this template and set of rules makes things a lot easier and stops me second guessing/doubting all the time. Will also be using this on the daily chart too for swing trades ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1) Thank you WD for providing the info. Much appreciated!

It looks good - text book entry. Manage this one carefully. Price is flirting with the 100 day moving average and that cold cause either some stagnation of the trade or volatility that tests your nerve.

Took this trade on AUDUSD last night on a 1 HR chart. Textbook perfect set-up. Set a TP order at the 200 SMA (Red Line) and closed it for 53 pips.

The daily and 4HR charts provide a greater level of probability and pip count per trade. But the opportunities are fewer. It depends on your trading style and the pairs you choose. I only trade 3 pairs and mostly only 2 - EU and AU and sometimes UJ (rarely).  
  
I have run this method on minor pairs/cross pairs and it does not work as well due to the volatility within typically choppy trends.   
  
See my post (#78) above: That was a 1HR chart trade and it was perfect.

hello wickeddaddy, here's a question, how could i handle drawdown in the event that the heiken ashi colors change back against me in a trade? i know that you have a mental stop loss but from visual backtesting the heiken ashi candles will change colors back and forth sometimes before the trade goes into profit. how do you deal with that?

On average how many trades will you have in a week following only EU-AU-UJ in your opinion?

In a week? I think it's more in terms of months, or better, years, to be honest, when trading the daily timeframe.

All time frames included, I probably knock out 3-4 trades a week on average. I have an account in which I trade 1 HR and 4HR charts. I have another account for 1D trades. I'm in the U.S. and the asinine rules prohibit hedging and require FIFO of orders/trades. So I could not have a long term 1D trade open while also trading the same pair on a 1 HR TF. Therefore, 2 accounts.  
  
I am EXTREMELY selective.

Thank you WickedDaddy for this simply but very effective strategy. I have a couple of questions, lets say that price is moving upwards on the D1, we have a candle that intersects with the BB, then disengages and changes color on the same candle, can we buy on the open of next down candle according to your rules ?? Many times I see that the MA's cross way before the trade happens, is there a max number of candles that you wait for after a MA crossover ??

No. I know it looks like one but let's review:  
  
You are looking for the first cycle up after the cross of the 15 EMA under the 50 SMA. That first cycle needs to contact the BB, release and switch to a negative HA candle.  
  
The entry you point at is the 4th cycle of retraces and that is an extremely weak entry.   
  
There has been some confusion about the the price touching the BB as being the only qualifying parameter. But as I state in my original post, you want the FIRST cycle after the cross. If it doesn't happen - no trade. Those are the rules.  
  
I bend my rules and I take trades that did not touch the BB. I take trades that perhaps only made it as far as touching the 15 EMA, with all other rules being met. I take 2nd cycle trades - but never the 4th. But I can do that because I have mastered the method I created. Another trader on this forum (Robinhood) said it best - It's like learning to ride a bike. Start with the training wheels on (the rules). As you get a feel for it and become proficient, you can take off the training wheels (bend the rules).

Hi Pips...  
  
I'm not sure I understand your question. If you have a chart that shows this, that would be great. However, based on what I think you are saying:  
  
If a candle intersects the BB, it can not then disengage. Once a wick touches the BB, it remains. The shape of the candle my change, as the body may shrink and pull away, but the wick can only get longer, not shorter. So even after that candle closes, it remains connected to the BB by its wick. It is true that sometimes the candle can change color to the direction you are looking to enter while remaining connected to the BB. Entry IS possible on the open of the next candle but that would be bending the rules and therefore lowering the probability of a successful trade. That is up to you.  
  
On the MA cross: Check the rules again. You want the first completed cycle (retrace) after the cross. Yes, this is X number of candles after the cross - it doesn't matter how many. The essence of this method is to establish a change in direction (MA cross), and then enter after the first retrace to take advantage of a continuance of the new trend at it's beginning.  
  
The principle is derived from the most basic of trading fundamentals that are standard operating procedure at many of the biggest asset management firms. It is to   
1\. Establish trend  
2\. Enter on a pull back  
  
The method I have developed is to identify when that pull back has ended and the trend will resume. I like the first pull back because even in choppy markets, I have found that you'll get at least one continuation out of even a short term trend change.

Thank you for clearing that up. By cycles I thought you meant each time it touched the BB and disengaged, so I'm glad I asked now. Will make a note of that and will be sticking to the rules as strictly as possible. Cheers!

That's tough to answer. I treat each trade as an individual situation with its own parameters for exit. But here are few basics:

  1. If there are no other mitigating conditions, I'll exit on the first color change of a candle. So, if I'm long, the candles are green, I'll exit on a red at it's close. Opposite for shorts. That's probably the easiest rule to follow.

  1. Mitigating conditions are things like: strong S/R zones, influential news is scheduled (NFP, Rate announcements), extended periods of the StochasticRSI at extremes (signaling an imminent change) or extended periods of price riding the BB (I'll exit when the price finally pulls away)

    1. Multiple of these conditions can set-up that will motivate a decision to exit.

  1. If I take a trade in the evening (during the Asian session for me) I will set a TP order for whatever I am comfortable with. It usually does not exceed 30 pips and is usually more like 20. But this means I can go to bed with a high level of confidence that even light volatility during the morning London session will trigger my TP and I'll make a healthy profit. This method is only when I'm trading short timeframes, like 1 HR.

  1. Trailing stops: I typically put these behind my longer trades, such as on a 1D chart. Once the trade has around 50+ pips of profit, I'll put a trailing stop behind it, starting at slightly above breakeven, for an average of 50 pips to start. As the trade progresses, I will adjust the trail tighter. It's very seldom that my trail gets hit. I usually exit manually before that happens. If the trade has made more profit than I anticipated, has a big day, sudden pump in my direction, or the mitigating conditions I mentioned are or will occur, I'll take the money. I hate seeing my trail get hit because, psychologically, it feels like I lost some money that I had at one point.

Once in a while I nail a trade and exit right at the turn for maximum amazingness. That feels good. But more often than not, I leave money on the table. And that is OK. I don't lose money and that is far more important.  
  
Caveat:  
So many traders count pips as a way to determine success. I don't. I use pips in my above explanations because that is universally understood. But I count dollars. My lifestyle and household budget does not run on pips. I know what I would like to generate in income on a monthly basis and that is what drives how I trade. Often, when I've exceeded my expectations for a given month, I'll take the rest of the month off, close all trades no matter where they are and just enjoy not thinking about trading. Trading done well is an intensely focused endeavor and takes a lot of energy and grit. It's nice to walk away from it as often as possible.

Hello WickedDaddy!  
Do I get it right that this kind of multiple touches of BB are disqualified?

It does not matter how many times price intersects the BB. The trigger is the candle that pulls away AND changes color (HA) thereafter.

I stay in it unless the loss exceeds my tolerance. I don't use so of my account on a trade that I can't tolerate some drawdown. But it's rare and has not been enough to coax me out of the trade.

One of them did and asked me to teach him. I spent a lot of time teaching him, starting with the basics. He very quickly decided he was an expert, dumped a load of money in an account and lost it all in a matter of days.  
  
That was the end of that.

I had an impression from previous discussion that price consolidating at BB (touching it more than once) would count as more than 1 touch, whereas rules say that trade should be after the 1st touch only. But I could be wrong.

I see. "First touch" means the first time price intersects the BB after the 15/50 cross in unison with that touch being the first cycle down/up (retrace).  
  
Remember, the set-up to enter is the candle that 1. changes color AND 2. has pulled away from the BB. Enter on the next candle. See my next post for a refresh...

Here is a trade I took yesterday at 0900 Central Time (U.S.) on a 1 HR chart. It is "Textbook" perfect. Let's review:  
  
1\. 15 EMA crosses 50 SMA up (first arrow)  
2\. Price retraces and touches the BB (second arrow)  
3\. StochasticRSI cycles down below 20%  
4\. Candle following the red candle that touches the BB is green and is NOT touching the BB (set-up)  
5\. Enter on next candle (white crosshair)  
  
Added bonuses:

  1. good separation of the 15 over the 50
  2. Price has broken above the 100 SMA and is bouncing on it for support
  3. StochasticRSI is rising

I held this trade for the day and set a TP for 40 pips, expecting it to continue after I went to bed, but experience some volatility and possibly a retrace at the London open. It closed at 2200 Central Time - just before I went to bed. It has continued to run to the upside today but 40 pips is a stellar trade in my book.  
  
One thing that I do that helps me focus on the rules is to save a picture of a trade like this, print it out and have it on my desk. when I see a trade setting up, I look at my "textbook" trade and ask myself, "does it look like this?" It's a good tool for a quick, visual check.

**Trade Journal:**  
  
In my first couple years of trading, I did not keep a journal. Like most, I searched for the holy grail, the bulletproof method that would fast track my trading success and make me rich. I was trying to take short cuts. I didn't believe a journal was valuable - I'll just remember stuff.  
  
I lost a lot money for all the same reasons everyone else does: anxious trading, revenge trading, changing methods every time I lost, having a method but not following it - not trusting it. Setting stops too close, too far, getting nervous and exiting with tiny profits while letting losers run wild, convinced that it will return and at least breakeven. Etc Etc Etc...  
  
I developed my method through all that experience. I read books about how indicators actually work, so I could understand that they are more than just a squiggly line on a chart, but what the math is and how it works. I tested methods live with real money so that I could strengthen my confidence as opposed to using a demo account that gives (IMO) a false sense of safety. I traded tiny making only pennies and sometimes a dollar or two, also losing those amounts. It taught me patience. I sought to simplify as mush as possible, so there would be only a few solid rules to follow, with minimal analysis and confusion.  
  
Even when I started doing well I still refused to keep a journal. There was no record of my trades other than my account statement. No record of why I entered, what the conditions were, why I exited or why the trade succeeded or failed. Finally, when my rules were "set" I decided to make a checklist. I would check the list for each trade and keep that checklist for the results. That was the beginning of a journal. I have since created a journal that incorporates the rules checklist that I have to fill out for each trade, all the details of the trade conditions, results and notes of the why, what and any factors that were influential (including dumb decisions).  
  
It has become the MAJOR difference in my trading success. The "Trend Cycle Entry" method works well. But only because I have a detailed, mechanical procedure for every trade that I take and a detailed history of each as well.  
  
If you are not keeping a trade journal, I strongly suggest it. It will change the way you think about trading.

Thank you WickedDaddy!  
I think I understand your approach. There was a nice trade recently on Charles Schwab, so it works with stocks too.  
  
What I asked a few posts above is whether price touching the BB several times in a consolidation phase is alright. From my short experience and what I've read above it is not a safe trade. That's what I was willing to confirm.

Multiple touches to the BB are perfectly OK. Ideally each of those candles that are touching are the same color and the reverse of the trade you want to take. I have included a picture of this: 

  1. After the cross of the 15/50 there is a retrace (cycle down)
  2. The red HA candles intersect the BB and remain intersected for 2 candles. It's OK if it were 3, 4, etc
  3. Then a green candle forms and it IS NOT intersecting the BB. This sets up the end of the retrace and you would enter on the open of the next candle.
  4. The StochasticRSI shows the bottom of the cycle as well and has began to rise at the point of your entry.

Often you will see that when price stays attached to the BB for more than just a few candles headed in a direction (up or down), it will negate your trade because the 15 will cross back over the 50 and nullify the rule. But if contact is consistent over several candles during a consolidation and all other rules are met as well, that is a strong trade.  
  
BTW, nice trade in your post. Yes, the method is based on market behavior, which is relatively the same for every market.

Wicked Daddy, sorry I didnt reply to your last post from a few days ago as I was traveling, but you did answer my question in other newer posts.  
  
1\. Its very obvious that this is a 100% mechanical system, and in light of that fact why dont you automate it ??  
  
2\. Because you dont use a stop loss as per say, roughly how many pips do you let trades go against you on an average, 40-60, 80-100 or more ?? I am trying to get an idea as to what your risk tolerence is.  
  
3\. What would be the percentage of all your trades break down be (476 trades) for D1, H4 and H1 be ?? For example, would 50% come from the D1 chart or would it be greater than than 50% ??  
  
4\. You also mentioned that most of the time you only trade the EU & AU, and sometimes the UJ. Have you tried any other pairs like Gold or GBPJPY or GBPUSD ??

First of all, I'm not that smart. I'm not a programmer. But even if I was, the only mechanical part is the entry rules. What happens after that is individual to the market conditions of the trade. The variables are many and I treat each trade according to the market dynamics, schedule (including mine), and other influential conditions at the time. I have seen many automated systems in which the exit criteria is the flaw that ultimately causes losses when there could have been profits.  
  
Besides, I enjoy trading and like being in control and having that feeling of winning every time I bank profits. Why spoil the fun?

I think the deepest I have a let a trade go against me was ~200 pips. It was a good trade but I pulled the trigger too early, had to deal with some political rhetoric, compliments of our former President, and had to wait it out. It took a few days to break even and I exited the trade at a tiny profit only because I was emotionally exhausted at that point and wanted to take a break from trading, reassess my strategy and execution errors, and get my head straight. Typically I am comfortable with 10 to 50 pips, depending on the timeframe.

A glance at my journal reveals approximately 20% daily, 40% 4HR, and 40% 1HR. This is not planned this way. It just so happens to be a rhythm I seem to have adopted naturally. BTW, that was 467, but it's 471 now.

I've traded GBPUSD a few times but I have not taken the time to really learn its "personality". I don't need to so why dedicate the time? When I had my CTA business, I traded S&P futures for my clientele. I still do in my IRA account. I've only been curious about the rest but again, not smart enough or perhaps too lazy to always have to figure out exchange rates for pip values of the trade. USD backed pairs are easy.

Hi WickedDaddy.  
Does it bother you when I want to ask a question? Why don't you make a trade at arrow number 1 (yellow). I see that the 1st arrow is very similar to the 2nd arrow trade you made.  
Is the trade with arrow number 3 valid?

Good day WickedDaddy,  
  
Do you trade 4h exactly the same as Daily chart or do you add any confirmation (sort of MAs) as you do for 1h chart?

Hello Wickeddaddy, Could you tell us which timeframe(s) are you trading?,  
  
EDIT..I read above

OK, Thanks, now we know..  
Also..  
"Finally, when my rules were "set" I decided to make a checklist. I would check the list for each trade and keep that checklist for the results. That was the beginning of a journal. I have since created a journal that incorporates the rules checklist that I have to fill out for each trade, all the details of the trade conditions, results and notes of the why, what and any factors that were influential (including dumb decisions)."  
  
Could you share it?  
Thank You

I only casually lurk on this thread so I may be wrong, but, it would appear your arrow location is incorrect. If long, price has to engage with the lower Bollinger Band (blue), then disengage, wait for a candle colour change and then buy at the open of the next candle. You appear to be using the Bollinger's MA middle line (white).

Where the arrow is should be where the continuation of the downtrend comes in since the averages are crossed downward. Also price has spiked the outer upper band. He removed the middle line on the bb

No prob - it's not a grail. My main question is howTo without a SL?  
Will wait for [WickedDaddy](https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/post/13890076#post13890076) kindly answer.

> Hi WickedDaddy. Does it bother you when I want to ask a question? Why don't you make a trade at arrow number 1 (yellow). I see that the 1st arrow is very similar to the 2nd arrow trade you made. Is the trade with arrow number 3 valid? {image}
> 
> Ignored

Questions, as long as they are relevant to the strategy don't bother me at all. Your question is a good one:  
  
Arrow 1 does show the proper entry criteria, although the cycle (StochasticRSI) is the 2nd and I prefer the 1st (see first post). When I marked this chart, I marked the trades I actually took. I looked back over my journal, as I also log trades that have proper entries but that I don't take. My notes say that I did not like the trade at arrow 1 because the short term trend was overdone and I thought the trade would not produce well... My assumption at the time was that it would most likely consolidate for a while and I try to stay out of those periods. In this case, I feel I was right. I'm not always right and miss some good opportunities but I'd rather miss opportunities than sit in a trade that is going nowhere or possibly loses.   
  
Arrow 2, while almost identical to conditions of arrow 1 (also a StochasticRSI 2nd cycle) was more in line with the direction of the Euro at the time. The 2nd cycle also was much stronger than the 1st and could actually be counted as the 1st because the previous cycle only barely touched 80%. (see first post) Also, purely based on my opinion, I expected further downside and I was right. But as you can see, if I had stayed in that trade for too long, price returned to the original entry point and would have erased all profits.   
  
My method is very mechanical. But it is not the only way I make trading decisions. A comprehensive trader pays attention to central bank strategies, geopolitics, economic conditions, etc. No chart is going to reveal those conditions. No mechanical method, no matter how amazing, is going to determine the future of price action while CBs are competing for currency weakness, politicians are attempting to manipulate market outcomes or staging fights over political territory, and economies hang in the balance while a virus threatens supply chain havoc.  
  
When the mechanical conditions line up, you still need to ask yourself; "will all other conditions support my trade?"

I use my 1 HR chart (with 100 and 200 SMA) for 4 HR as well. If price is above the SMAs, I am generally looking for long positions, and vice-versa for the opposite.

I notice you are on a 1 HR chart and not using the 1 HR chart set-up (includes 100 and 200 SMA).  
  
That trade sat right on the 200 SMA during an uptrend. I would be looking for long entries during an uptrend.

wd I do not remember. IMHO It is better to post charts showing which pair or stock is used and the time unit so that we can reproduce the configuration on our platform for a better understanding. TIA

Could we use the stochastic as a guide? For instance when the lines come out of the ob/os territory? I don't have as much trust in the Heiken ashi candles as you do. I'm sorry

That looks like a very tempting trade. However, it is occurring on the 2nd cycle of the downward cross (count the number of times the StochasticRSI cycled above 80% after the 15 EMA crossed below the 50 SMA). So that breaks rule #1.  
  
The 15 EMA is intersecting the 50 SMA at the close of the set-up candle (first red,your arrow). That negates the trade. I would not have taken this trade - so I would not be needing a SL. Here is how it looks on my chart:

I have not traded since late last week. This Ukraine situation needs to be at least somewhat resolved before I trust the typical market dynamics.  
  
I don't need stop losses because I don't force the trades or take risks on trades that are "just OK". They have to be perfect or I don't enter.  
  
PATIENCE and DISCIPLINE are the holy grail of trading. No method will ever replace those.

Here is a screen shot of the Performance Analytics of one of my accounts. You will see that I have placed 16 trades so far this year in that account with 0 losers. Unfortunately, the system does not compute performance because there are no losers to compare to. Thus, no risk/reward or disposition either because it needs at least 1 losing trade to compute those metrics.

Thank you for so many details in your answers!  
Have you some more filters|points of attention in your analysis or they all are described in your first post (and addition for 1HR TF some posts later)?

They work together. To your point, a turnover in the StochasticRSI indicates a stronger probability than it just being at its extremes. It just depends on how conservative you want to be. Being more conservative means taking fewer trades, which means being even more patient.

I lied, I actually did have a losing trade. I have a test account in which I trade a small amount for the purpose of testing slight variations of my method. I remembered that I caused a trade to lose in October of last year because I clicked on the wrong button. Stooooopid mistake! I was going to add to a short trade and when I decided to click on the "sell" button to add to the trade, I clicked on the "buy" button and that closed the trade at a 3 pip loss. I still don't know what I was thinking to do such a dumb thing... but oh well. Ugh!   
  
So here is a better representation of trading results with all the scorecard BS calculated:

I recently posted this in an answer to Drsun:  
  
My method is very mechanical. But it is not the only way I make trading decisions. A comprehensive trader pays attention to central bank strategies, geopolitics, economic conditions, etc. No chart is going to reveal those conditions. No mechanical method, no matter how amazing, is going to determine the future of price action while CBs are competing for currency weakness, politicians are attempting to manipulate market outcomes or staging fights over political territory, and economies hang in the balance while a virus threatens supply chain havoc.  
  
When the mechanical conditions line up, you still need to ask yourself; "will all other conditions support my trade?"

Review this post: [https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...6#post13890076](https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/post/13890076#post13890076)  
  
It shows a perfect set-up and reviews the rules.  
  
Secondly, My system has only been used consistently on EURUSD, AUDUSD and occasionally USDJPY. I have not used it consistently on any other pair. If you are trying to employ this system on CADJPY (your chart), you are in unchartered territory and in my opinion, risking the unknown.

I only trade 3 pairs: EURUSD, AUDUSD and occasionally USDJPY. I have chosen the first two for ease of pip value calculation and trade volume. 1 pip at 1 lot = $10 US. Easy. (I'm in the US). I trade EU when the US dollar is strong (short EU) for the carry. I trade AU when the dollar is weak (long AU) for the carry. I occasionally look for long trades in UJ, also to capture the positive carry when dollar is strong.   
  
Why not get paid to hold a trade open?  
  
It is important to build focused expertise. Trading a dozen different pairs does not build that level of expertise on any one of them. I know professional stock traders that are in and out of the same one company. They have learned the flow of money in that one company so well that it's damn near like insider trading. That's the level of focused expertise you want to achieve.  
  
My system may not work that well on other, minor pairs or exotics. I wouldn't know for sure. It has failed on GBPUSD during the Brexit debacle and every now and then GU gets wild swings for unknown reasons. So I stopped trading it years ago.   
  
You don't need to trade everything. You need one, maybe two instruments that you learn and know deeply. You can make a good living this way. There is a reason neurosurgeons make more money than general practitioners. They specialize. They don't give flu shots and diagnose runny noses while also trying to diagnose and fix other ailments. Neurosurgeons fix brains and that's it. I choose to specialize.

Agree GBP pairs get some crazy swings, probably perfect for scalpers, but intraday should stick to calmer pairs like EU and AU, I also like NZD/USD sometimes when is stronger or weaker than AUD, it makes some crazy dips.

WickedDaddy, thank you for answering same questions again and again. Though questions are similar and you seem to say the same things over and over again, you often add details and important angles, which contribute to a better understanding.  
  
For me, it was important that you remarked that StochRSI also needs to have the 1st cycle for the setup to be most reliable (although I see from your examples it's not always the case). The way I see it, it is no less important than for the BB to have only the 1st touch to proceed with the rest of conditions.

Agreed on NZDUSD. I have traded it during times of geopolitical mayhem, such as what is happening with Ukraine. NZD seems unaffected and most likely due to it being too small and insignificant on the world stage for anyone to be concerned about it being affected by war. I'm watching it but have not traded it recently.

Ha ha... yes, it seems the same questions keep popping up but in slightly different context. And yes, the answers are similar because the rules are the rules. I have said before that I occasionally bend my rules. But that is due to my familiarity and comfort with my system as well as my risk tolerance. Anytime a trader begins to work a system that is new to them, he/she should stick like glue to the rules. Over time, they will become familiar with them so well that they will "see" when a trade is good, even if one of the rules is not exactly met, but close.   
  
Look back on my post that displays the perfect trade (post 108). This is what you want and you don't need that many of them to see your account grow.

**NO STOP LOSS ORDERS**  
  
Some of you may have read in 1 or 2 of my posts that I don't use stops. To be clear, I don't use stops that would result in a loss to my trade.  
  
When I first started trading, I traded stock options (20+years ago). I used stops. Option prices can be very volatile and as a result, my stops were hit more often than not. So of course I made them wider. They would still get hit. I think most traders can relate to this: you create or follow a method, everything looks great to enter an order so you pull the trigger, set your stop, and watch it like a dog watching its master prepare its meal. Then the trade becomes profitable and your excitement builds. Then the trade reverses, hits your stop, and you've lost money only to watch it reverse again and become what would have been a profitable trade. There you sit, frustrated to the point of absolute madness. I have been there. I have smashed coffee cups, thrown my chair across the room, screamed at God, cried, and blamed the evil institutions for stop hunting my trade. And of course... changed methods a hundred times in my search for trading nirvana.  
  
I bet some of you are laughing at this because you know exactly what I'm talking about.  
  
At one point I resolved that I needed to figure out how to trade without using stops. I decided that the only solution was a lot of what I have been talking about in previous posts:

  1. Develop a system and TEST THE HELL OUT IT (scroll way back on a chart, mark every instance, count up winners and losers of at least 100 trades)
  2. Document how often it results in a good trade and a bad trade - document the percentage of success
  3. Look at every losing trade to determine what factors played a role - build the repetitive factors into the rule base - Test again, repeat, test again
  4. Test what you think is your final system against different instruments to see which one produces the most consistent results - why does it win more on one than the other?
  5. Test different time frames for the same reason
  6. During all this, simplify, simplify, simplify

Obviously this took a lot of time and effort. But what is worse; losing money in mere minutes or investing your time to become proficient at making money?  
  
I became satisfied with my system and I traded without stops as way to force my discipline. At first, it was nerve wracking. But I knew my system (at the time) had an 87% success rate at becoming profitable. I had also documented the conditions that resulted in losses the other 13% of the trades. So I felt in control. Over time, I have become comfortable with "no stop" trading.  
  
I tell this story to qualify my personal choice to trade without stops. My choice was mainly to satisfy my psychological need to pressure myself into creating a system that I believe so strongly in and know so well that using stops would be introducing a fear that I should not have. It's more about my confidence than some reckless approach to trading. It's a mindset. I don't suggest it for everyone and especially not for new traders. But if you want to force yourself to trade as disciplined and diligently as truly successful trading requires, I challenge you figure out what that trigger is for you and work it into your mindset.  
  
I've not thrown a coffee cup at the wall since 2014.

How did you locked those 13% without SL? Manual closing?  
And what about a high volatility moments (like first COVID monthes in 2020 and, sorry for this example, something like 11sep2001)?

Thank You for all your effort to enlighten us , great thread, I'm going to use this "system' in the lower timeframes, polishing it a little, but following most of the rules, using Mt4, and interested in your indicator that ". I have other alerts that tell me when the candles have disengaged from the BB",  could you tell us about it?, where we can get it", if somebody have it?(Mt4), can you share it?

The percentages were established through manual back testing. (review my post) I scroll way back on the chart and then mark each place where a trade would be entered as well as observe whether that entry would result in a profitable trade. I logged each one into a spreadsheet and analyzed them accordingly.  
  
Trading View has a useful tool for this called "Replay".

As far as events like covid: I did not trade until trends were established. I stopped trading Forex at the beginning of February 2020. That said, I did place a rather large short on the S&P 500 just prior to its crash due to covid. A big part of trading is keeping abreast of influential events. We were hearing about covid in China at least a few weeks before the first cases hit the U.S.. China is a huge supplier of goods to the US. I deduced that an epidemic in China that was already shutting down factories and shipping ports would have a ripple effect on the U.S. economy due to supply chain interruptions. The S&P was at all time highs and there was a weakening of buying volume that was happening even before covid became a pandemic. So I shorted it with futures contracts. I was right and about a week later, the first covid cases hit the U.S. west coast, China was in full lockdown and the stock market went off the cliff. It turned out to be an incredible trade. But I stayed out of Forex until mid April of 2020.

Alerts can be set in Trading View for almost any kind of condition. Have you heard of, seen Trading View? There is a free subscription but the better tools are in the paid version. Still, it's inexpensive and a very good tool. I don't use MT4 so I don't know how to set that up. Perhaps someone here that is an MT4 wizard can help with that.

I know that you use Heiken Ashi candle (HA). But Bar Replay is not available for this chart type.

Do you reckon this could of been a potential losing trade WD? I know you said AUDUSD was one of your main trading pairs so thought you might have an opinion on this setup. Just wondering if there was anything that would of made you avoid taking this?

Price retraces and touches the BB (second arrow) 3. StochasticRSI cycles down below 20% 4. Candle following the red candle that touches the BB is green and is NOT touching the BB (set-up) 5.

Hello WD, my observation is regarding your entry from the stochasticRSI emanating from the oversold region with all conditions satisfied for a buy trade. The "entry point" seems to be the Second cycle of the stochRsi which negates your rule. I see the entry as BB entry( bounced as explained) in unison with the second cycle cos the 1st cycle was half completed before going to the oversold region for the next one you chose as your point of entry. Pls clarify, thanks.

I am sorry, according to WD's rules, I dont even see a sell trade set up here at your red arrow because candles did not breach or disengage from the top BBands, which is the first rule in his set ups.

That's because I'm asking if it would of been a buy, not a sell.   
  
MA's at the time of candles were still a buy, had touched and disengaged bottom of BB, stochrsi moving up from below 20 zone and the HA candles had changed to a buy also.   
  
Ticked all the boxes for a buy which is why I'm curious whether he would of took the trade or not.

If you're looking for 30 to 40 pips.....Yes  
I think I will let it play out for the moment.

I just subscribed to your page. I find your system very interesting and simple. I'm looking at this setup for NEOUSD. Daily emas crossed bullishly and now I'm waiting for price to touch lower bands on H4 for entry if all confirmations are met. Does anyone else see this setup playing out nicely??

I'm just trying to stick to the rules that WD uses and making entries as mechanical as possible. At the point of the entry the MA's were giving a buy signal. So how it be a sell trade?   
  
Well if you read his rules for a trade then you would see that my arrow does confirm all the conditions. Hence why I'm asking whether he would of took the trade or if there was something that would of prevented him from doing so?

Basic rule which was not fulfilled was this marked on screen... {image} One of the rules say certain distance between MA's has to be present... pullback or cycle, how WD name it, is far to low... We have almost crossing of MA's Look we have 14 days permanent downtrend, In this moment both MA's are showing trend direction and your entry suggest trading against it ... BTW when you switch to H4 you will see nice entry for Sell. This kind of structure must happen to trying go long {image} This how I see it... Best Regards

The MA's haven't crossed at the time of the entry. The cross happens after (hindsight)  
  
The trend is actually up. (To the left has made higher highs & higher lows)  
  
So sticking to the rules this would of been a buy signal. I'm just curious to see what WD thinks, that's all. I'm not here looking for a debate.

For a Buy set up, I would say that the MA's are getting ready to cross down, so even though it might be a valid set up, its not the greatest. Everyone has certain rules of there own, like for example WD does not carry any trades over the weekend.  
  
I have 2 rules of my own as per say, number one is that I ignore any Doji or really small candles, in this case (on your chart) the HA change of color candle was almost a Doji. Rule number two is that I dont always open trades on the first candle of the week, unless its a really strong continuation candle in a down or up trend like the Sept 1 candle. I find that most of the time the Monday candles are very weak with no direction.

I think this is a good setup. I'm analyzing AU and the overall trend is down on D1 and weekly bearish ema crossing.

So nice and encouraging to know you have been living off trading (FX) since 2014.  
Do you trade other methods or just the one outlined here?   
Appreciate.

I remember watching that trade. I didn't take it. The 15 EMA is almost intersecting the 50 SMA - too close for my taste and a cross negates the trade. In this example, the 15 EMA is sharply headed for that cross as well. Remember, while not an absolute rule, good separation is a strong bonus. Sometimes the 15 EMA gets close to the 50 SMA but begins to curve to flat or away due to some consolidation. Those conditions strengthen the probability of a profitable trade, even though the 15 EMA may be closer to the 50 SMA than would be otherwise comfortable.  
  
That Gold trade you pointed out in your previous post resembles those properties.

Yes, that is true. Manual scrolling is the alternative. I've also used replay with standard candles while making judgment calls against a matching chart with HA that I am manually scrolling in unison. It's tedious but worth the effort.

It is setting up but remember to wait for a red HA candle to close and then review the conditional rules at that time. Will the 15 EMA cross the 50 SMA upward at that point? Will the 15 EMA begin to round down and what will the StochasticRSI be doing at that point?

Your chart looks very different than mine - This is AJ daily and according to my chart, is not a trade.

The "entry point" seems to be the Second cycle of the stochRsi which negates your rule. I see the entry as BB entry( bounced as explained) in unison with the second cycle cos the 1st cycle was half completed before going to the oversold region for the next one you chose as your point of entry. Pls clarify, thanks.

Someone is paying attention! Ha! Well done. I will explain:  
  
A "cycle" is a retrace in which the StochasticRSI travels fully to the opposite extreme. So yes, it appears the first cycle had already occurred. Here's the catch: The Stochastic cycle had not ended AND the candles had not intersected with the BB. At the point the candles did intersect the BB, the StochasticRSI had returned to below 20% without cycling upward to 80% or even midway to 50%. Anything below (for longs) or above (for shorts) is not a completed cycle. So in this case, the first cycle was still in play.  
  
Here is another trade from my "library" of perfect trades. I compare pending set-ups to these to confirm my decision to enter. This one (below) is EURUSD on January 12, 2022 at 0700 Central US Time on a 1 HR chart. It's a beautiful trade.

First, I notice you are trading a 1 HR chart. My 1 HR chart includes a 100 and 200 SMA for trend reference. Your chart is missing that and I notice that a few of your proposed trades are against the trend (comparing them to my chart). I only trade in the direction of overall trend. I explain that somewhere in this thread specifically regarding trading short timeframes, like 1 HR and 4 HR charts.  
  
Most of your proposed trades are on the 2nd or 3rd StochasticRSI cycle. Yes, they touch the BB, but on the 2nd or 3rd cycle. Rule is BB engagement/disengagement on the 1st cycle. Otherwise, no trade.   
  
Trade 4 looks tempting for bending the rule (it's on the 2nd cycle). All things considered I may have entered that trade. But I am asleep at 0500 (my time) and so I missed it.

To HA candles. I occasionally switch to standard candles to get a glimpse of the actual entry point, but I prefer HA for its simplicity.

I assume you mean that I will post a trade live. Certainly. I have taken about week off, as the Ukraine situation is better avoided and I am having a pool and outdoor entertainment area built in my backyard. The construction has been intense. It's been difficult to focus on anything else. I expect to trade this week and will post a "live" trade at the point I enter. I'm watching EURUSD for a possible set-up on the hourly chart as I type this. It's in the 3rd cycle, which is not good, but I'm contemplating it anyway. AUDUSD also is setting up a first cycle trade on the hourly and 4 HR but the BB needs to tighten up... both of them are flat - no trend (4 HR) , which I typically avoid. So we'll see.

Hello WD, thanks for the clarification on what a complete cycle is, honestly, I have been following this thread and I can't wait for more updates or factors to determine the validity of the setup. Your simple strategy is an eye opener for me cos I have been learning so many strategies with numerous amount of indicators. Now, I can always have a near clean chart, watch like an owl and strike like an Eagle. Still learning your strategy though.  
2\. Regarding the trade dated Jan 12, 2022, the set up looks nice and I tried to zoom into the picture, the stochastic was a nice 1st cycle execution but the price only bounced on the 15 ema and nearly touched the lower BB. So, why did you take the trade? What else did you see to must have entered that trade??? I patiently wait for your response. Thanks WD

Hello WD, like I side, I m still learning your strategy and it worths the effort. I just want to make an observation from the little backtesting I have been doing with my little time.   
There are times we find profitable setups on the stochastic second cycle or perhaps the third cycle and I noted that for this cycles( 2nd and 3rd) to be as strong as the first for a profitable trade, it comes simultaneously with either a hidden divergence ( wc signifies trend continuation ) or a classical divergence at the extremes of the stochastic. WD, I don't know if you noticed it or do you have any market structure / pattern/ trace /level that you watch out for to take the second or perhaps the third cycles at times?. I await your kind response, thanks WD.

So, why did you take the trade? What else did you see to must have entered that trade???

On my chart (the one I posted for that trade) the red candle that closes at 0600 US Central Time has touched the BB. The next candle closes green, thus triggering the entry on the open of the next candle (the white crosshairs). Perhaps your chart is different? I have noticed that different brokerages, due to their pricing/spread, do often display minor differences in price action on comparable charts.

> {quote} Hello WD, like I side, I m still learning your strategy and it worths the effort. I just want to make an observation from the little backtesting I have been doing with my little time. There are times we find profitable setups on the stochastic second cycle or perhaps the third cycle and I noted that for this cycles( 2nd and 3rd) to be as strong as the first for a profitable trade, it comes simultaneously with either a hidden divergence ( wc signifies trend continuation ) or a classical divergence at the extremes of the stochastic. WD, I...

I do occasionally take 2nd and 3rd cycle trades and yes, I watch for various conditions to make that decision - divergence being a major consideration. I also look at things like price proximity to a strong MA, like 100 or 200, as those tend to cause pause or reversal in price even if temporary. What is the trend? Flat MAs are problematic - price is stagnating, consolidating or just plain going nowhere. I like to see a direction or at least price above or below long term MAs.   
  
I've said before; my technique is only that, a technique. But it is not the decision maker. I am. That is why I don't believe in automating it so that the computer makes the decision. There is SO MUCH more to trading than just thoughtlessly pulling the trigger based on a few mechanical rules. Those just simplify the analysis of the "moment".  
  
Perfect trades are tough to be patient for. But they are worth it.

From Russia it doesn't look like Ukraine strain will dissipate soon. Most likely, markets will have to learn to live with this uncertainty.

Are you in Russia?   
  
True, I don't expect it to just go away. Either it will become something more than the current situation, which will send markets one way. Or, it will dissipate into a political quarrel of rhetoric and markets will treat that by going in another direction. But a direction either way. It seems markets are "holding their breath" currently. If the uncertainty continues for too long, markets will become bored with it and move on. That's just human nature.   
  
Whatever your situation, I hope you are not negatively affected by it.

Yes, I am. Of course, as long current leadership is in place, we'll see the strengthening of sanctions. Question is how fast it'll unfold and how hard ordinary people will be hit.

Excellent work!  
  
Somewhere in here you may have read that in my testing, I realized an 87% success rate. I am curious what you have found in your research... Have you analyzed 100 set-ups and logged the results? Or perhaps more? If so, what conclusions did you have?  
  
Also, based on any similarities of the failure conditions of the 8 set-ups you posted, what are your conclusions?  
  
I'm very interested!

On the above examples, look at price in relation to the 200 SMA. On Trade 5, after the very large candle to the left, I would expect price to pull back to that point. It's a no trade for me on any of those.

Could you specify what you suggest to pay attention to when you say about price relation to 200-SMA?

Hi WickedDaddy thanks for your response, highly appreciated. Yes, absolutely. AU did not further bother to continue the set up, as price eventually continued to go higher again. Also 15 EMA is almost crossing 50 SMA up as we speak, and color of HA candle has not changed. So for now I leave it as it is.  
  
Actually I had a nice trade yesterday with GU, I managed to rake up some pips. Thank you for sharing your system and your contribution to the forum.  
  
Happy trading and many pips to you.

That UJ trade looks good. Fundamentally, if the Ukraine situation gets ugly, money will move to JPY as a safe haven and make that a really nice trade. It's on the second cycle, but I'm watching it as well.  
  
Congrats on GU trade. Well done.  
  
I missed the AU trade on the 4 HR chart. I was busy and wasn't trading. The StochasticRSI was a bit messy at the bottom of the cycle but I would have taken that trade. Pissed off, because it was worth around 60 pips, depending on my exit.

I don't use MT4 so I don't have any. But I believe someone posted MT4 indicators/template earlier in this thread.

Would anyone consider starting a discord or telegram group where we can all share our ideas using this strategy in real time?  
  
Big believer in a collective of minds/eyes on the charts are better than just the one. Could be useful for spotting trades or sharing ideas regarding other pairs/markets etc.  
  
Just a thought. If not then I will stay active on this thread regardless. Love the template and strategy that WD has provided. Very simple and effective!  
  
*Edit*  
  
I do currently have an active discord group already with around 6 people who are actively trading fx & crypto everyday. Would be willing to open it up if people were interested? Of course I would only do this if WD agrees or would like to start his own instead maybe?

What has your chart got to do with WickedDaddy's Trend Cycle Entry method? WickedDaddy trades, as far as I know, mostly D1 and has shown others how to trade his system on H4 and H1 with additional MAs. Your chart appears to be a 1 minute chart. My 2 cents.

Agree. Discord channel would be super nice. I also made a few indicators based on the WD method. Would be happy to share them in his discord group (if he makes one).

An absolute truth. But, it's a chart using TA that is out of context with the theme of this thread.

No Bollinger Bands, wrong MA's, no stochrsi etc.. What relevance does your charts have to this thread?

It's on the second cycle, but I'm watching it as well. Congrats on GU trade. Well done. I missed the AU trade on the 4 HR chart. I was busy and wasn't trading. The StochasticRSI was a bit messy at the bottom of the cycle but I would have taken that trade. Pissed off, because it was worth around 60 pips, depending on my exit.

Hello WD, it's on the second cycle of the StochRsi because it has passed the 50 mark and almost @ 80 mark for the completion of the first? Just for verification. Thanks

It sure was tempting. But my rules don't include trading during geo-political events the magnitude of the Ukraine situation. I'm 100% in cash and sitting it out.  
  
There is always another trade.

Clayton,  
Please feel free to do whatever you want. You don't need my agreement. Sharing my method here makes it public domain and I hope it results in profits for those who use it. Personally, I will not be starting a telegram group or otherwise. That is beyond my focus on trading. But I think it's great if others want to do it.

My chart looks different than the one posted:

All the arrows and comments should explain it well. Typically, a cycle is above 80% or below 20%. But if it gets close I'll count it. Another thing to consider is the price action of the cycle. Let's say it doesn't get over 80% but the candles reach the opposite BB, disconnect and become negative. Highly unlikely that this actually happens but if it did, I would enter that trade.  
  
As I said before. I did not take this trade. It would have been a good one if looking for some quick pips. But the geopolitical risk is/was high. Choosing to trade events such as this is gambling, in my opinion. I'm sure many have made lots of money during this time, while others have lost just as much. Coincidentally, USD and JPY are the strongest currencies as I type this. So I was correct that cash would stream into JPY as a safe haven. USD has attracted more value due to the amount of cash pulling out of EU and GU, driving the DXY higher. Could I have anticipated that? No... thus, happy to sit it out.

I'm going to throw something at you that is completely unorthodox. But it proves a point.  
  
The chart below is USDJPY 4HR. We focus so much on candles that for this exercise, I have removed them. There are 8 vertical lines on the chart. Red is to enter short. Green is to enter long. The criteria for a trade is:  
  
1\. White (15 EMA) crosses Green (50 SMA)  
2\. StochasticRSI opposite cycle, then green (K) crosses red (D) AND is in the purple zone (between 80% and 20%) - enter here or add to the trade here.  
  
What do you see?

There are two trades, the 6th and the 8th that would be barely profitable if held very short term - a few hours max. The rest are very profitable. To be fair though, ff we count 6 and 8 as being losses (hitting a stop loss), you still have a 75% success rate in just these 8 trades alone. Do the math. 6 good winners, 2 small losers depending on your risk tolerance.  
  
Sometimes, eliminating the complexity can make things abundantly clear.

I do not argue anymore with negative people . It is a waste of time and energy. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Why I stumble on this thread ? because of its title. Trend Cycle Entry. I am interested in Cycles since 2006 and I work with.  
  
Obviously I am interested in Trend(s) hence in Moving Averages  
  
As traders we are all interested in Entry - when and where to enter and Exit - - when and where toexit. And also where to position our Stop Loss

Even under the vigilant scrutiny of Tobesure, I assume that reposting and commenting a chart posted by WD is allowed. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Tobesure being an expert in Cycles, Trends and Moving Averages knows for sure how a Moving Average works. Only his modesty and discretion forbids him to tell us.  
  
A Moving Average is a Low Bandpass Filter. This impressive mathematical formulation is just used to dissuade traders to understand how Moving Averages work in trading.  
  
a) First a Moving Average suppresses all frequencies equal to its span. Hence here on WD chart you see in green the MA 50 (4 H). Then it suppresses all 50 Time Units Cycle ( if it exists one in the data.)  
  
b) the MA 50 reduces greatly all fluctuations lower than 50 Time Units. Sometimes you find traces of these minor fluctuations in the 50 MA. Here we see none.  
  
c) the MA 50 let's go through all fluctuations (frequencies, vibrations) greater than 50 Time Units and summed them Up  
  
It is why the MA 50 show us the Trend of all fluctuations within the data whose period (span) is greater than 50 Time Units.  
  
A moving Average is a smoother. You can see it when observing the 15 EMA in white on the WD chart. Clearly the 50 MA smoothes Price Action but also the shorter term frequencies displayed by the 15 EMA.  
  
15 and 50 are the cut off points used by Wicked Daddy in his Trading Sytem

I don't care whether you argue with me or not. It's not a case of being negative, it's about the context of your posts. You are taking the word "Cycle" in the thread title and inserting your Hurst Cycle "religion" into it. Anyone can see that this thread is all about WD's "Cycle" system, not Hurst's or Parisboy's "Cycle" system. WD has meticulously detailed how his system works so that others can take advantage of it. All your posts have the potential to do is dilute the effectiveness of this thread and confuse people that stumble across it looking for a relatively straightforward and mechanical system that allows for some discretionary trader input.  
  
Your system obviously works for you and I don't doubt it's efficacy if you can understand it. But this thread is not the place for it. The most helpful thing you could have done is posted a "one-liner" in this thread saying "If anyone is interested in another take on cycle trading, please take a look at my thread". That's it. Simple. But instead, you showboat with your chart entries that have zero to do with the theme and basis of this thread. Your arrogance goes before you.

I see that what I thought would happen, unfortunately has happened... as it does in probably every thread on any forum, regardless of topic.  
  
Someone hijacks the thread with their opinion or whatever. Some jump on board while others reprimand the hijacker (appreciated, thank you). Ultimately, the thread becomes polluted with berating banter back and forth and the integrity of the original intent is lost.  
  
I started this thread to share with this community something that has worked well for me. I learned a lot here early on and it's my turn to share some experience, for what it's worth. I fully expect that some experienced traders will offer ideas, views, and insight that will not only improve the technique, but provide valuable education to less experienced traders. That is my hope.  
  
If I am to assume positive intent (which would be my preference), ParisBoy has perhaps unintentionally introduced a concept that could be perceived as related to my method. But it could also complicate it and confuse those who are attempting to employ my version of TCE into their trading. I will respectfully ask that we stay on point and focus on the method for which this thread is dedicated.   
  
If we can't manage to do that, I will shut the thread down before it becomes devoid of its original intent.

Your' looks to be a good thread. You are giving Paris Boy way too much credit. There is no positive intent. For him, it's about how anything any one shows,it can be replicated by his tools/concepts he has learned. Not the first thread he has done this nor will it be last. Best to put him on ignore and continue on one's path.

**A Guy's Gotta Sleep...**  
  
Below is an example of a trade I set up before going to bed last night. We're looking at EURUSD on a 1 HR chart. I went to bed during the second to last green candle before they turned red. I estimated that price would continue upward and intersect the contracting BB at 1.1240. This would satisfy all the rules except the candle color change rule. I also estimated that it would then reverse and fall to at least that area of consolidation, producing 40 pips of profit. I love waking up to money in the bank. So I set up the order and contingent TP order and went to bed.  
  
Well, as you can see, it didn't get there. The order didn't get triggered. You can't win 'em all. And to add insult to injury, the current candle is hitting the entry target and intersecting the BB. But only time will tell what happens from here.   
  
Damn the torpedoes! Full speed ahead!

Buy set-up on 4 HR EU? I don't see it (at least, not by the rules).   
  
There was a 2nd cycle buy set-up on 4 HR AU that looked pretty good. I didn't take it because the 100 and 200 SMA were holding the price at the time and I had to go to dinner with a former client. It turned out to be a good trade. I probably would have entered once price cleared the MAs - At least the client bought me dinner... Could have banked some cash on that one.

Cool!  
Maybe in this version of the system you could share your TP\SL methods?

First, the 15 EMA crossed back over the 50 SMA, upwards. That negates the trade.  
  
Second, I was asleep at that time in the morning. But even if not, refer to the above.  
  
That drop happened out of fear of the Ukraine invasion. Sure, the short opportunity was awesome and other methods could be used to grab some pips in that short term parabolic move. But we're not discussing those methods here.   
  
Take a look at that event on a 15M chart and see the 3rd cycle that met the criteria. I don't advocate tiny timeframes but if your risk appetite includes small timeframes and also allows for 2nd and 3rd cycle entries, go for it.

I don't trade that version. It was just to make a point. But just for fun...  
  
I would add a BB and put the SL just above (short) or below(long) the deviation at the time of entry.  
  
I would set a TP for at least 1.5 times the stop in pips if I couldn't manage it. Otherwise, I would close the trade when the StochasticRSI was opposite the entry. If it returned (repeat cycle) and the EMA had not shifted, I would re-enter and go for another ride.

WickedDaddy,  
Based on the Trade Cycle Entry method you have shared here in this forum below setup of NZDUSD should be matched with entry Criteria ...  
NZDCAD Daily TF has got almost the same condition for entry.

It's the 2nd cycle. Also, on W 0.84 acts as support. I'm not sure if the W timeframe has to be taken into account. Maybe WD can shine light on this. My 2cts.

it's not clear what you are asking. NZDCAD? You posted an NZDUSD chart. The entries look clear based on the rules in Post #1. But I drew them on your chart anyway - freehand, so please forgive the amateur mouse control...   
  
I'm showing 1st, 2nd, and 3rd cycles:

Looking at NZDCAD, the weekly is in its 2nd cycle after the cross (week of May 10). It has not completed this cycle yet and is nowhere near BB intersection yet. The daily is in a weakening down trend, with the latest uptrend extending for a longer period of time than the last one, and above the 50 SMA. This could be a turning point and may result in consolidation and likewise, choppy trading for the near term.

Thanks WD, yes, good observation, I like the part about the 2 uptrends. I did not notice. It surely could be good signal to stay out of a nasty short trade.   
  
Happy trading,

Another thing to consider is the current price is consolidating at previous support, now resistance - the launch point of the previous uptrend. NZD could certainly weaken and be sold down to a new low. But this recent uptrend is coming off a historical buying zone (look at your weekly) and the RBNZ recently raised rates to 1.00%, making NZD a good carry trade. My bet is for a slow and somewhat choppy uptrend to previous averages of .87 - .88 in NZDCAD.

Your set up does not meet WD's set up rules, because the MAs have no separation and are on top of each other.

What an interesting thread. Thanks WickedDaddy for sharing this. I finally became a successful and full time trader with a very similar system. Of course I don't want to hijack your thread but since my system is so similar in it's fundamentals to yours I thought it may be useful to members liking and in turn profiting from your Trend Cycle Thread.  
  
I trade on an M5 chart. I trade only Oil and Gold, but the system can work for anything. This way I'm almost always in a trade during London and New York hours, (just because that's my daytime).

What I showed in the above post is the trade method and so I showed the perfect trade, but in my actual trading that differs in the exit method.  
  
What I do is when another white Magic Dot appears I move my SL under it to secure a profit like in the picture below.

Thanks for sharing Derek.   
  
What i do see when i backtest it, is that it is all repainting (only the yellow/white dot indicator is not repainting).   
  
That is a huge difference between this system and WickedDaddy's original system.   
  
If it works for you: nice ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) But i know repainting indicators play a different role than non-repainting indicators, so that people know that it is not suited for everyone.

Forward test it on demo and see how it works. I develop indicators/EAs on MT4/5 and the standard question everyone asks about any indicator is "does it repaint" like it's a smart question to ask. Many indicators need to repaint because data changes over time. It's not wrong for an indicator to repaint depending on what it is actually doing. Also, many people confuse repainting with dynamic data resizing in an indicator window. The windows are only so high/wide so, if the data coming in exceeds the current high/low values, the indicator windows will adjust its rendered values to accommodate the new information. It looks like the earlier values are repainting but they aren't - they are just visually recalibrating to the new X/Y axis values.

I understand your point. I know some indicators repaint some don't, and some repaint differently from others (Axis, recalculated). My point is more, if i compare this to the original system: Bollinger bands/ema's/StochRSI stay on the exact same place, all the time. They of course develop on a newly formed bar, but the historical value stays the same.   
  
With Dereks indicators, i do really see that for example the value of the bands in the cycle indicator, change. The Chaos-indicator repaints/vanishes sometimes after it has been painted. This means: a chart seen now will be completely different than 10 minutes ago, and that is a huge difference in how you trade compared to a systematical trading approach that WickedDaddy uses.   
  
Im not saying it won't work, all i say is that if you see a nice screenshot of a chart of Derecks system, in hindsight it looks good, but in the moment it all changes. And that is not happening with charts that use the WickedDaddy system.

No. Re-read. Look a the Cycle Trend indi. That is what it's all about. But the Cycle Trend indi is a place not a point. Chaos and Magic Dot give you a point. It's still a Dart board, but at least you can see the road map.

Chaos and also Magic Dots re-paint. It doesn't matter though. An indicator that doesn't re-paint still shows up, but as wrong. Right? So what's the difference. It's just a point. Don't stress about re-paint issues. This is a price action method visualised.

Lets apply the perfectly famous zig zag to the chart. It's by no mistake that traders use this re-paint indi to find TRENDS. Not entry points. A picture is worth a thousand words:

It is the pursuit of the perfect trade that clouds the cycle and a good enough trade within it. Use The Cycle Identifier, Stochastics, MACD, Zig Zag, RSI, or what ever. In the end you just need a part of the trend that they show you, You can NEVER get it all. Good luck trader friends. I'm going to leave this now except for answering questions as this is WickedDaddys thread.

Sorry WickedDaddy, but if I may add one last thing to your thread. Traders will find the Break Even indi in my .zip file. That is used when the trade is taken, but price still goes against you. You can re-enter again with another trade and the Break Even indi will show you the Break Even point between multiple entries. A different discussion though.

Wicked Daddy  
  
Thank you for starting this thread and sharing your trading system. That's very generous of you. The alerts are key for me as I can't watch the market while I am at work. I can take trades, I just can't watch the market during working hours. I also see a couple of elements from the system used in Barry Burns book "Trend Trading for Dummies".

Hello derekw, How can you rely on your trend cycle indicator ? It's position differs by zooming in and out !

That is true. Good for spotting. Your bottom image is the correct zoom. Zoom and TFs will alter the picture. But go back in time and see if its working for you.

That is indeed the 4th cycle. The trend has already been going on for a while now on this timeframe. So i think WD wouldn't take it as it is, but he can say that for himself of course ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Well, that's the thing lol: you can't rely on any indicator from that system, because it will repaint every second, is not backtestable (only forward-testable), and the indicator differs while zooming in/out. So i would say: watch out and be careful ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

I do really appreciate the effor from Derek, but i think it might be better to put that system on another/new thread instead of here, because it is totally different than the original system from WD. But that's just my 2 cents. We are in WickedDaddy's discord by the way, where i/we are trading live and making good profits. The link is somewhere in this thread.

It's the 4th time StochRSI goes back under 20, after the 15EMA/50SMA cross up (I assume that is the white+green line)

Can I ask why you hated it? Did the rich people not pay you enough? I'd love to trade other people's money and get paid for it ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

I think WickedDaddy means the first _price_ cycle, not the first _StochRSI_ cycle. Refer to the image in his 1st posting, the white arrows on the chart represent all first _price_ cycle. Please correct me if I'm wrong with this.

Hmm, post 238 might clear it up a bit. There it looks like he uses the StochRSI cycle as cycle. The arrows in the 1st post are possible entries, i think that those don't represent the cycles itself. But WD can clear this up the best i guess ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Man, thanks to you I have now PIPS coming out of my ears. :-)  
  
I have a different strategy which looks a lot like yours (based on keltners), but have added your cycle theory to it.  
  
Now it makes sense.  
  
Lifechange stuff.  
  
Thanks,

Nice! In my view: when both RSI stoch lines did not cross the 50 level up, after being in <20 level, then it's still the 1st cycle in my opinion ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

WickedDaddy!  
  
This guy actually posted a video about your strategy 

Inserted Video

, anyone who has still trouble understanding these indicators check this video out.  
  
I have some questions and it would mean a world to me if you could answer them:  
Could this work on 1 second TF on leverage trading?  
  
I have few questions and if You could answer them It would make my day for sure.  
1.Can you trade any other coins (BTC,ETH,SOL,MATIC) or does it have to be EURO/USD  
2\. There are many examples of this strategy not catching the up trend, me myself I believe this strategy I've red the code and your test results are very convincing, but look at this <https://prnt.sc/f8Z4qHVeTx5G>.  
3.People are getting rich by doing this. There aren't big % profits from one trade, but that doesn't matter right? You will slowly keep getting money and those 1-5 % profits will get you a lot of money, right?  
4\. From my perspective I would test it out with small amount of money and when I'm sure this is it, I would put a lot of money into it, because these 1-5 % aren't cutting it if I'm not putting in a lot of money and I'm only risking of losing few % from this great strategy, or maybe you disagree with me?  
5\. (IMPORTANT) He changed the Stochastic RSI (Originally: Stochastic - 10 and RSI - 13) (He left it 14/14) and also he changed EMA (Originally 15) (He changed to 25). These changes you made do they make this strategy better or does it even matter?  
  
If anyone out here could spend just few minutes of their time to help me out, that would be amazing.

Does it matter which coin you trade? I see a lot of you are trading stock, right? I'm trading crypto and I'm just wondering does it matter what you trade when you use this strategy?

This might be a silly/paranoid question, but is there a chance that this much exposure will mess up the strategy?  
  
I’ve seen numerous traders talk about how they don’t share their strategy online because the strategy then becomes messed up if thousands of people adopt it. Is that a valid concern? I’ve used WickedDaddy’s strategy on two successful trades.

To be honest I would prefer the leave system as it is as in post #1. It has proven to be successful that way. So why clutter up your chart? I don't get it.

Thanks Jube totally got it now, I studied post #238, along with current charts. It makes more sense indeed to use the StochRSI for counting cycle. I found a good example on NZDCAD (H4) to illustrate. According the rules, a short position is tempting: price has touched upper BB, and changed color to red. Except for the fact the StochRSI is in the 2nd cycle. Hence price halts and start moving north instead of south. Can you confirm we are on the same page?  
  
Thanks and many pips to you.

Ah.. I see, okay. I noticed IG offers also MT4 support, so you could consider using the MT4 platform i am pretty sure it has StochRSI indi by default, otherwise it will be available on the web as download.  
  
I hope you will manage to get it. I am using ctrader myself, which also does not offer stochrsi by default, but I found it it the community, downloaded it and installed it. Works for me.  
  
Hope this helps.  
  
PS. Or tradingview?

Click the paper clip icon at the top of the page. The Stoch RSI indicator is attached to one of the posts in this thread. It's available for MT4 and will work on IG MT4, no problem.

I found a good example on NZDCAD (H4) to illustrate. According the rules, a short position is tempting: price has touched upper BB, and changed color to red. Except for the fact the StochRSI is in the 2nd cycle. Hence price halts and start moving north instead of south. Can you confirm we are on the same page? Thanks and many pips to you. BT {image}

So, according to WD i think this would be correct: 1st and now 2nd cycle!   
  
Only, i personally count a cycle from both StochRSI lines going above 80 (or below 20). In this case not both StochRSI lines crossed 80, so for me this would be the 1st cycle where we are now. But that is my personal taste, WD would count this as a 2nd cycle, because the 1st one crossed the 50 level.   
  
So for now, you are on the same page as WD ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1) !

@WickedDaddy thank you so much for a great strategy we can go off and test, much appreciated and very kind of you.  
  
Do you mentor any traders at all, or is it something you'd maybe consider...really interested if so?  
  
Many thanks and hope you're well.

I was just joking. Mainly.  
  
But consider this:   
  
If any trading system turned out to win consistently and was publicly known, more and more people would use it over time. A lot of people would be able to quit their jobs and live off the income generated by the winning system. If it was wildly successful everyone could live off this trading system and no one would have to work their day jobs. It's therefore logically consistent to state that no well-known trading system can be consistently profitable all the time for everyone that uses it. Don't you think so?  
  
My suspicion is that this system works very well during good trends and it a good way of buying dips during uptrends and selling rallies during downtrends, so I would like to see how it responds to highly-volatile and non-trending markets.

Ok, that makes sense. I don’t use WickedDaddy’s strategy often because as he pointed out, the stars don’t align every day with it.  
  
Thanks for replying, I’ll actually be putting that in my notes for this strategy (I have a folder full of notes/caveats/tips/etc).

Just a quick note to all in this thread:  
  
I have been consulting to an asset management firm I was once associated with and it is taking up all of my time. So, I have not been here for a while. I should be done with them next week and can answer questions at that time.  
  
There are a couple people here, The Jube for one, who are using the system successfully and have been very helpful. Thanks!  
  
BTW, pretty crazy that someone made a video and claimed credit. Whatever... There are 1000's of profitable systems and millions of unprofitable traders. That pretty much sums up the valuable use of good trading systems.   
  
See you all soon!

So, on my chart as you can see, the MA-cross was long done before, and we are now in the 5th StochRSI-cycle. So that is not entering now, at the beginning of the trend, but entering when the trend has been going on for a while now. Better now, is to go to a lower timeframe, like the H1 and M15, and wait for a new MA-cross down on the H1 or M15 to enter short in the direction of the longer term downtrend of H4. But still, be cautious to sell here because we are going down now for over a month, and are touching the upward sloping trendline on the Monthly timeframe.

Hi TheJube, thank you for your response. Yes, you are completely right, I mistakenly saw that MA touch as a crossing and did not look further back. Hence I considered it wrong. So I guess we only take the set up right after the first real MA cross. Which potentiality can hold up a long time, like for this GBPCAD . That automatically skips all set ups there after the 1st cycle.  
  
As far as I understand you correctly, you always consider lower time frames for entry like H1 and M15 when a trading on H4. I noticed other (lower) timeframe give often opposite signals: on H4 a perfect set up for a sell might be forming, but on lower tf's it shows also a perfect set up...for buy. That can confuse me big time.  
  
Anyway, I will be looking at the next pairs the next week. Hopefully I get it right this time.  
  
best regards  
BT

If you are trading this on 1D chart, so you enter trades when the new day starts and the [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") get big?

Hello. Thanks for sharing your strategy. Magic_Dots is an interesting Indi. Do you have source code? If not, do you know what the basis of the indi? MA cross? BB Cross?? I always try to produce a signal generator for a strategy. Helps to have source code for each indi in the strategy. Thanks.

Hi BT. I see those H4 eur pairs your talking about. HA candle close looks kind of weak to me though. Do you take that into account yourself?  
I'm still holding my very small short position on EURUSD. Daily HA candles sure calms things down.

Some setups currently on the AUD pairs (H1).  
  
BT  
  
update: did not take any trade on these pairs. AUDNZD was looking the best of all, but turned bearish again.

Well done! Do you take higher and lower timeframes also into consideration before a trade?

It would be good to get more signals with a lower time frame.  
What I mean is that the indicator would also indicate the second cycle.  
The other idea is that it should not touch the top / bottom of the BB, but the center line of the BB would be enough. As an extra setting option.  
I don't use SL. I use Reverse as my Trading robot has options.  
StochRsi would be good as a change.  
I hope you understand my poor English.

Okay thanks, that's great. You obviously understand this system pretty good. Would you take a short trade in this particular set up (attached), according to post #1?  
  
Hopefully you are able to give your perception. Thanks before and regards!  
  
BT  
  
PS. hint: I lost quite a few pips in this short trade ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1). Luckily it's still paper trading account lol

Hey there, I have been playing around with this on ETH/USD today:  
5 min chart, HA candles  
Risk-reward was 1:4, risking 1% to make 4%  
I used ATR, period 3, and multiplier 2.5x to get my SL (done on Japanese candlesticks)  
I entered per trend (cross of 15 EMA and 50 SMA) and each "cycle" had only 1 entry  
For Buy I would:  
a) StochRSI was under 20 (both lines) for at least 3 bars (closed 3), then I would enter on the third bar close if it was green, or the next green HA candle  
b) I would buy per the rules - BB touch, disengage, green HA candle.  
Often, these two conditions would be happening at the same time. Sometimes a) gets faster entry though.  
  
Reverse for Sell.  
  
I tested on April 11th from the morning, until April 19th morning.  
Counted 35 trades  
Win: 11  
Loss 24  
That means 11x4% profit - 24x1% loss = 44-24 = 20% profit  
No fees, or commission...  
Most wins were 2, most losses 11  
  
There is most likely some variation of the strategy, but again, I was just playing around with the main concept. I only added the rule that I would enter if 3 candles closed above/under 20/80 and the HA is the right color. And I added exact RR + ATR for SL. That's all. I can send some screenshots from Tradingview if you want.  
  
EDIT:  
Attaching 2 screenshots as well for reference.  
It shows the detail of the trade, at the bottom is StochRSI, I changed it to cross for my reference. 3 bars closed under 20 lines. Next green candle I went long. The entry was on the Japanese candlesticks chart where I also set SL/TP. I added an arrow as to where you should have entered according to the rules, but unfortunately, the candle did not touch BB, but it is not a set in the stone rule if I got it correctly. Anyways, the next picture is the whole trade. 1:4 RR.

Well done! I only trade forex, mainly because I don't have a clue with crypto, all main coins seems to be following each other in the same direction. I haven't followed it quite through yet lol![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f602.png?v=15.1).

  1. How do you set you targets and SL?
  2. What TF are you trading?

Looking forward. Best regards., BT

Yea, I tried to give it a shot, but I guess I will get to Forex as well.  
  
1) ATR - period 3, multiplier 2.5 is used for SL. TP is 4 times that value. So if SL is 20 pips, TP would be 80 pips (RR 1:4)  
2) 5 min

Instead of using moving averages 15-50 cross and bollinger bands as entry conditions you replace it with bands and the trend, when it touches the lower band and the trend is up you can consider a buy along with the rest trend cycle entry conditons heiken ashi and stochrsi

WickedDaddy has not been online since March. Probably living the good life. As for your question, I personally only count 'complete' cycles. So on your print screen, I would count the 3th cycle as the first, and probably would have taken this trade.   
  
Best regards

Good afternoon! First, my gratitude to WickedDaddy for this topic... I took the liberty of putting the system indicators together ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) Everything is in the archive, the general view of the assembly is in the photo. All profit!

The strategy rocks. I love it on 1H and 4H.  
Signals on a daily are incredibly rare if You trade only EU, AU, and UJ.  
What instruments do You trade with this strategy?

Entered a bit late but in gain. When STOCKHRSI on h4 reverses long and aligns with stochrsi on daily, price starts long. hopefully

the BIBLE of the system (with all due respect to the sacred text!!)  
  
  
  
1\. 15 EMA attraversa 50 SMA verso l'alto (prima freccia)  
2\. Il prezzo ritraccia e tocca il BB (seconda freccia)  
3\. Lo StochasticRSI scende sotto il 20%  
4\. La candela che segue la candela rossa che tocca il BB è verde ed è NON toccare il BB (set-up)  
5\. Entra sulla candela successiva (mirino bianco)  
  
Bonus aggiunti:

  1. buona separazione dei 15 sui 50
  2. Il prezzo ha superato i 100 SMA e sta rimbalzando su di esso per ottenere supporto
  3. L'RSI stocastico è in aumento

  
Ho mantenuto questa operazione per la giornata e ho impostato un TP per 40 pip, aspettandomi che continuasse dopo che fossi andato a letto, ma ho sperimentato una certa volatilità e forse un ritracciamento all'apertura di Londra. Chiudeva alle 22:00 ora centrale, poco prima che andassi a letto. Ha continuato a salire oggi, ma a mio avviso 40 pip sono un'operazione stellare.  
  
Una cosa che faccio che mi aiuta a concentrarmi sulle regole è salvare un'immagine di un mestiere come questo, stamparla e averla sulla mia scrivania. quando vedo l'avvio di un'operazione, guardo la mia operazione "da manuale" e mi chiedo: "sembra questa?" È un ottimo strumento per un controllo visivo rapido.

why doesn't it come down?  
  
I think it depends on H4.  
Stoch h4 is not aligned with stoch D1.  
We wait for alignment and then it should go down. Next week

Thanks Gunerkoca. could you explain the rules of signals? I think they're clear but I'd like to hear them from you. why indicators have an expiration date? what to do to get the version without expiration? I await your kind reply. Thanks in advance

Set a stoploss, or, like TS mentioned on page 1, a mental stop. There's no need to blow accounts with trade management.

He has NO any strong idea of the trade management: mental, shmental, fixed or any other - just nonsense words about nothing - and this is the essence of the post #1: "No SL, TP is when it's enough for me"

This is from #1: I ran a trailing stop that I tightened as the trade progressed.

I set up a template on this and it seems that it is working. I am very busy right now, but sometime in the future I will make an indicator setting the buy arrows. And a little alarm of cause.  
  
My suggestion is:  
TP on the opposite BBand. Or maybe take half and trail the rest. I think SAR could be the trail.  
SL over last swing.

So here is a trade. It's a bit ranging right now, but SMA50 is trending, so chances are, that this will be a bouncing trade.  
  
I know, I don't use Stochastics.

Yea if you check Stochastics its on second wave. Did you do backtest without Stochastic ?

I am brand new on this thread and I was a bit too fast. I will use Stochastics.  
  
My backtesting is very little at first when I start a new tool. My process is like this:

  1. Set up the chart template and include it in all 28 Forex pairs.
  2. Click around different charts for some hours. Does the strategy seem valid?
  3. If yes then forward test using microlots - real money.
  4. Make a robot.
  5. Backtest using the robot.
  6. If backtest is OK, start using money in a right scale.

About Exit I think it should be when Stochastic cross the opposit 20/80 level.  
You could exit the half and trail the second half. Exit would then be when second half cross back over center BB.  
  
Set BE should be when center BB is cross.

Further to my check list.

  1. 50MA shall still be trending. The steeper the bitter.
  2. Bollinger is one of few tools that can tell if an instrument is ranging. Hence to place an order, the distance between the 2 outer bands should be increasing.

Add on when bar no# 2 is going in the right direction. Same SL as first trade.

Could you share your experience if you are still working on it ? I did 2 live trade , both of them were fail. Trades were on prop firms so I couldnt hold in lose because of daily draw down limit. If I opened a trade with small lot size It would be winner. Both of them were usd pair and trades were after fomc it was also a bad decision .
