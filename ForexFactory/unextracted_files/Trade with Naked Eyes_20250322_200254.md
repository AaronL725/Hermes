I am introducing this M 15 chart to take at least that 10/20/30 pip . This thread is mainley to see how you can trade without indicators for new traders as well as experinced traders .  
  
The concept is consolidation and breakout  
the concept is low or lower low  
The concept is view your chart through your eyes the very important and the important  
The concept is patience  
consolidation is a night mare  
  
I am trader with almost you can say 8 AM Indian Time to 12.30 PM Indian time  
  
This is a new concept and try it out

You did mark the important area's to watch..  
  
Things I would add to your system.  
1\. Know what time of day your favorite pair consolidates..  
2\. Know the time of day your pair get active.. (usually when the local banks open)  
2\. Know what time of day reversals typically happen on your pair... its often like clockwork..  
3\. Know how much your pair moves during average session for Asia, london, and usa sessions.  
  
Certain pairs often follow a pattern based on time of day, and traders will often take a long break when the average movement is reached.  
If you find like one session more then another, focus your energy where you are having the best luck.  
  
use your levels, with some timing.. and you got a system! 

The only system that will work is one designed by and for yourself.

Naa.. it s really not new.  
Simple trading technics/naked systems lead a trader to keep focus on what we see.. and avoid cluttering with unneccessary indicators.  
There are many influences like timing and news that come together before a chart gets my interest.

It is but natural questions such as yours should come from a close observer like you of currency pair behaviour , particularly those who have observed the co-relation between the movements with impending (pre-announcement) and already happened (post-announcement) fundamental events, bank holidays, opening and closing of sessions, weekends, the end of weekly, monthly, quarterly periods on a macro level and Hot hours of each session on a micro level. Naked chart trading is very simple to follow, but it involves patience and planning. And most profitable of all the trading methods.  
  
You really have chosen a nice subject.  
  
I feel you have covered enough on how to detect patterns by watching the charts.  
  
Now the question to be answered by the system are:  
  
Which patterns are more profitable than others?  
  
What is the ideal timeframe to follow: M1 or M5 or M15 or any other TF?  
  
And when to trade the patterns?  
  
finally,  
  
(a) how much risk should be taken on . How many pips?  
(b) how much to expect profit on average. How many pips? 

Practice makes a person perfect

Which patterns are more profitable than others? Pin Bar/Horizontel line struggle  
What is the ideal timeframe to follow: M1 or M5 or M15 or any other TF? For short term profit M 15/ M 1 big noise  
And when to trade the patterns? I prefer the USA session after the close of UK session  
  
  
I dont generally trade Asia but since I saw the opp went for the trade

Inorder to a avoid the big noise in the system. Look for big picture in H4 time frame and little bit of candle behaviour . The h4 candles should show direction say in the case of down trend  
  
The bulls will try to push the price up and you see the needles on the four hour close  
  
In the case of previouse bull run and if you notice those big or average needles on the top it is a question of pride for the bears to touch those bull candles  
  
Price always comes to the place it started

In a bear trend say in H1 chart you have the big bear candle and next meduim bear candle and the next the candle in small in size which means the price is squizzed and it may not mean most of the time the price is going to go up . You may take a short and use SL of the squizzed candle if you think u are aggresive . now the squizzed candle high is 1.16677

Hello Green.  
It is great what u r doing ,, and i believe from my own humble experience that naked chart trading is the most effective way to trade .  
I would like to add to what u r doing IF i may .  
There needs to be an understanding of price action .  
The market does NOT do a Sunday afternoon park walk.  
The market moves up and down and it does it for a reason .  
once one can understand why it will move ,, the speed it moves at from time to time as it will vary for a reason ,,, where it is going to ,, and most importantly ,,, WHERE IT WILL STOP ..  
All those factors can be mastered and very clear on the charts and on every time frame ,, day after day .  
It is something i will NOT discuss in public forums with all due respect ,,, and for obvious reasons .  
Cheers,  
George 

LOVE YOUR GAME WITH A PASSION ,,,,, WORK WITH A VISION ! ! ! ! !

Bearish Harami  
The bearish harami is made up of two candlesticks. The first has a large body and the second a small body that is totally encompassed by the first. There are four possible combinations: **white/white, white/black, black/white and black/black**. Whether a bullish reversal or bearish reversal pattern, all harami look the same. Their bullish or bearish nature depends on the preceding trend. Harami are considered potential bearish reversals after an advance and potential bullish reversals after a decline. No matter what the color of the first candlestick, the smaller the body of the second candlestick is, the more likely the reversal. If the small candlestick is a doji, the chances of a reversal increase

Consists of an unusually large black body followed by a small white body (contained within large black body). It is considered as a bullish pattern when preceded by a downtrend  
  
But that white body in H4 IS not in the middle of that long black body

I'm short from 1.2176 sl: 1.2265. I took the position Friday  
morning around 8AM EST. I wanted to trail the stop, but  
fell asleep because of whacky sleeping patterns last week.  
Luckily price didnt suddenly reverse on me through my stop  
again. I'm thinking about moving the s/l asap to 1.2170, about  
breakeven. I'll cover on another bounce around 1.1205 area,  
but I'd like to leave the trade open and hopefully make some  
decent gains on a break below 1.2060 area. I wish I wouldve  
gotten in earlier, but have been focusing on the GBPUSD and  
USDCHF lately.  
  
Is anybody in this trade?  
  
What do you think about moving my stop to 1.2170? Too tight?  
I placed it here because I'm thinking there is at least two levels  
of resistance from where we are now on Fri close @ 1.2124:  
1)1.2140 Fri high after bounce from 1.1203 (near Fri low) and ~50%  
fibo from Friday high to 1.1203  
2)just above 61.8% fibo (1.2159)of 1.2213->1.2077) and a prior intraday  
support for Friday  
  
If it breaks these, then I will wait until a break of 1.2213 to glong  
or play smaller fibos to look for small pip gains until there is a clear  
direction??  
  
I want to be in a somewhat of a decent position just in case if it  
breaks out of this daily consolidation. I might be able to re-enter  
on a bounce of 1.1205 area and back down off of 1.2200 area. What do you  
think of my reasoning?  
  
How can I improve this type of fibo support/resistance analysis ... maybe with some indicators? I noticed the intraday and daily double tops and headandshoulders, btw, but didnt mention them. Both are trend reversal signals, so it is a high probality we will see more downside, but it's still kind of iffy as to when for me.  
  
Thanks

I considered getting in around the 1.1697 area or somewhere around there but was waiting on all of the news to settle down. I ended up taking a nice EJ sell down for +40 though it ran to my initial target of +57. I had to leave and didn't want to get stuck in a trade over the weekend. Never let a winner turn into a loser :-)

Bring in that big boys attitude in your trading. Who are those big boys could be bank/financial Instituation/big time investor/news/country/POLITICS/ etc  
  
Read their mind through your chart and the way they moved and the possible way they could move and u move accordingley  
  
Having said that how I read their mind step one  
  
starting from M5 chart spot those big candle either bull/bear and check in that M5 how further away or further down they travelled.Those travel up or down again draw the line whcih is basically will be the support or reisestnce for you to pull out that 10 pip  
  
As soon as you open your computer dont use your mouse to click the buy or sell  
  
Even M5 chart could be daunting for you or you are bored with it and those are the times we can call as consolidation means no one has taken the view or the direction. These is the time you have to move just above M5 to M15 or M 30 or to H1 or to H4 or even daily and analyse  
  
if you are in EU trader for 24 hours or that matter of any currencey for 24 hours it is easy pizzey(I LOVE THAT PHRASE)  
  
Try to go in one direction to get that maximum out of that situation  
  
_**Stop loss very important**_  
  
**additional order if you are dam right will bring in u more money. Start with small order and then add more on to it . do not glare in your computer screen that I am happy I got 10 pip be alert to pump in that situation to create more qty within ur budget**  
  
What are thoese additional order nothing but retracement .**Retracement does not mean that the price is going to fall down/move up at great length**  
  
Say for eg there is no news on everyday basis for companies like google/apple . The news for them could be monthley or 3 months basis result or one of the big gun went away from that company and the market panicked and we take the advantage. No Indivdual is important for the comapany it will run even without him because they have the basic foundation to move  
  
**The news is created on an hour to hour basis . You know what are those news**  
  
I put a buy order it got clicked and I saw 1 pip green and I went for a smoke and it got vanished/ Your chart view is not correct  
  
I got up from the bed and i saw the EU went up or down by 20 pip shit I should have been their /Then these the time you have to be alert and look out for that retracement  
  
I got Pizzed on that day say last thursday the EU went up by 100 pip and I was not in my trading desk because I went with my girl friend or famley outing.Not to worrey you have another day in ur trading desk  
  
Sorry for my english or spelling  
  
Every trader has a day/  
  
Confidence/ Practice/**patience** is very important in forex

You are doing a nice job. Keep it up. If this 61.8%fib retracement of the last fall is broken firstly(looks like it has) then we may see 1.173x.

Let me explain here You sold the pound from yesterday at 1.315 and u sold again just below that and u sold again just below that and again . Then there is no hard sell on pound which means the market has came to a halt means there is not much selling pressure and we came to the consolidation path. Since i Noticed the consolidatation and since the bull is overtaking the market I decided that i will be part of the bull till the bull reaches where the bear sold the pound at 1.315 which is nothing just put your horizontel line on that**big bear bar top**

Bring in that big boys attitude in your trading. Who are those big boys could be bank/financial Instituation/big time investor/news/country/POLITICS/ etc  
  
Read their mind through your chart and the way they moved and the possible way they could move and u move accordingley  
  
Having said that how I read their mind step one  
  
starting from M5 chart spot those big candle either bull/bear and check in that M5 how further away or further down they travelled.Those travel up or down again draw the line whcih is basically will be the support or reisestnce for you to pull out that 10 pip  
  
As soon as you open your computer dont use your mouse to click the buy or sell  
  
Even M5 chart could be daunting for you or you are bored with it and those are the times we can call as consolidation means no one has taken the view or the direction. These is the time you have to move just above M5 to M15 or M 30 or to H1 or to H4 or even daily and analyse  
  
if you are in EU trader for 24 hours or that matter of any currencey for 24 hours it is easy pizzey(I LOVE THAT PHRASE)  
  
Try to go in one direction to get that maximum out of that situation  
  
_**Stop loss very important**_  
  
**additional order if you are dam right will bring in u more money. Start with small order and then add more on to it . do not glare in your computer screen that I am happy I got 10 pip be alert to pump in that situation to create more qty within ur budget**  
  
What are thoese additional order nothing but retracement .**Retracement does not mean that the price is going to fall down/move up at great length**  
  
Say for eg there is no news on everyday basis for companies like google/apple . The news for them could be monthley or 3 months basis result or one of the big gun went away from that company and the market panicked and we take the advantage. No Indivdual is important for the comapany it will run even without him because they have the basic foundation to move  
  
**The news is created on an hour to hour basis . You know what are those news**  
  
I put a buy order it got clicked and I saw 1 pip green and I went for a smoke and it got vanished/ Your chart view is not correct  
  
I got up from the bed and i saw the EU went up or down by 20 pip shit I should have been their /Then these the time you have to be alert and look out for that retracement  
  
I got Pizzed on that day say last thursday the EU went up by 100 pip and I was not in my trading desk because I went with my girl friend or famley outing.Not to worrey you have another day in ur trading desk  
  
Sorry for my english or spelling  
  
Every trader has a day/  
  
Confidence/ Practice/**patience** is very important in forex

No Issues I will start from M 5 putting together the ema100 AND EMA 20 and we draw the horizontel lines . I want everyone to be the winner not loser nor i will never deceive the trader . In small time frames do not wish for big pip

In M 5 bar draw all the pin bar on the top step one . Step 2 see the distance between EMA 100 TO EMA 20 . if the candles are further away in m5 from EMA 100 you are in bear trend. The candles always attracts to EMA 20 AND even EMA 100 to go further that is why we are using the horizontel lines as support or resistence  
In M 5 chart you need to ask the question are we going to 1.5539 or are we going to 1.5626 which is EMA 100 touch

use this formula and put it excel  
  
yesterdays daily  
  
plot high low close  
  
pivot add H/L/C AND divide by three you will get pivot  
  
S1 HIGH-LOW-PIVOT  
S2 HIGH-PIVOT-PIVOT  
R1 PIVOT MULTIPLY BY 2 AND MINUS LOW  
R2 HIGH-LOW PLUS PIVOT   
  
MARK PIVOT FOR TODAYS TRADING IN H 1 CHART WITH EMA 100 AS SUPPORT  
H1 CANDLE ABOVE PIVOT U ARE IN BULL RUN AND VICE VERSA  
  
IN THE EXCEL ADD ONE MORE COLUMN AS LAST CLOSE AT THE TIME YOU OPEN YOUR TERMINAL  
  
if the last traded close is less than R1 and also pivot u are looking for short  
  
use if function in excel = if ( last close > RI,"SELL") AND if (last close > pivot,"sell") if both say sell u have more confidence and same for buy  
  
use alligator for the new traders for some more confidence

Hi. greengp. I agree, the trend still on going.  
I like your thread to trade by the swing and following the rhythm of plain chart.  
yes of course plain chart is not the only chart im into, but sharing the signal by pivot is something my favorit.  
EU 15 will get a long bearish and it has not touched the ISM Manufacturing PMI news.

I like your thread to trade by the swing and following the rhythm of plain chart. yes of course plain chart is not the only chart im into, but sharing the signal by pivot is something my favorit. EU 15 will get a long bearish and it has not touched the ISM Manufacturing PMI news. {image}

It was fun but it is not lot of hard work. qty of trade matters . I went short at around 1.13739 with small qty to see S1 at 1.13282. the price picked up to pivot 1.14059 pray to god and i put large qty at around pivot which 1.14059 then again the support is very important from the traders . 11% growth

I am long on this trade and what are the + factors  
  
DAILY CANDLES ARE ABOVE EMA 50 AND ALSO IN H1 CHART  
  
THERE IS RESISTENCE IN H 4 CHART TO CROSS OVER EMA 50  
  
We are still trading above the pivot 1.13694 and the support zone is 1.12636/1.13282. as long as this is not breached i may add long on dip

Long time traders based on daily there is macd cross over . Does not mean the price is going to come down as early as possible but an indication of bear sentiment  
so sell on rallies   
  
macd on daily is not going to trun back asap also

So what are the indicators used   
  
1.21007 in m 5 was pin  
  
alligator   
  
macd was drifting down   
  
fibonacci from low to high in m 5 to see whether h 1 will pick up above 50% on the strong move   
  
so i put my trade to be to see what will happen

Once you are confident with your first trade say large qty . Then bring that small qty down to see your stop loss will be hit just for fun
