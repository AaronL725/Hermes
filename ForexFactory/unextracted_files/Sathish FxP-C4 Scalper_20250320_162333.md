Dear Financial freedom seekers  
as many i enter the forex market with the hope, soon i can be financially free with little effort.but with in few month the glorified image of a consistence profit is fade off.then search of near holly grail system started. this has led to an endless debate on the actual feasibility of profitable trading(highter time frame,swing,carry trades etc).i am found that near holly grail in scalping .scalping may not be for everyone. this thread sole objective is to show how can scalp with consistent profit day in day out

all of the coming post will be the 1 min scalping on any pair.the benefits of scalping are plenty and speak for themselves.just one single chart with few indicators.one-click in and out.every thing preset.and opportunities abound in an almost repetitive loop.

this is my understanding in forex trading if you want to success and consistent. dont looking 1000 pips a month.400 pips is enough (daily 20 pips) every 1000 usd capital set the pip value is 1 usd. after six month your capital will be 10 000 and monthly income is 4000.i think montly 4000 usd is fair enough to lead a happy life

when you trading with this method dont be greedy.once you reach your 20 pips daily target please shut off the computer and start tomorrow.this is the way you can profit consistenlt.i am pretty sure about it.

best pair to achive 20 pips a day without much risk is EURUSD. TO A NIMBLE SCALPER THIS PAIR IS AN ABSOLUTE DELIGHT.IT OFFERS HIGHLY REPETITIVE INTRADAY CHARACTERISTICS A LOW DEALING SPREAD

Many professional traders will sure have built a trading method that leaves no room for freehand interpretation .on other hand plenty of new traders would completely freeze up in such situvation.i can sure that successful traders had one common trait.they take the trading activity very serious. i could say that mind set of a business entrepreneur.its means they have invested in education know their field and do not indulge in unrealistic expectations.they are confident in what they are doing.

in my opinion, the minutes right before big fat red news is the best time for scalping ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1) also two minutes after the news

We live in a world filled with varied and diversified people from vastly different cultures and mindsets.within this plethora of variety are two groups of successful people: the gifted and the skilled.the gifted are a special breed with an inborn talent which makes them successful in their natural environment.  
the skilled are those who lack the gift and have to work hard and understand the environment in order to succeed. as you find your way into the business of finance,you will be at a lost at knowing which one you are and how you should approach this business  
if you feel,for now,that you are not from one of these two groups of people, FOLLOW THE RULES

Wealthpro, I am in. This looks very easy. Surely any beginner can trade. I also agree on 20 pips per day can make your life very easy.Once we can accumulate like a Cigarboy and trade 40 lots, well, one days profit will be more than most peoples monthly salary. That is why most Pro's said, keep trading simple, and you manage to just to do that with this system. Thanks. Now I can train my wife, as for me the time tis difficult.

All indicators are price driven and or repaints or are very delayed ... this is a nature of indicators ...  
you are trading oposit signals against main trend?? Is it wise?

Hi,  
  
I don't know if this helps in any way but the "smsuper TRIX setting 3,2,2,1,0" looks like an histogram applied to the 12 period moving average (it functions as equilibrium). So all we need is an alert that tells us if price closes up or below the 12 period moving average (applied on close) and we declutter the chart.  
  
Cheers

No, I don't think it is clutter but if you want to put more stuff...  
  
It was not the purpose of my post to offend you, Sir. I think it is great and a great research job you have in there not to talk about the altruism in sharing it.

I don't have any problem. I don't understand something. You advice us to study Warren Buffet and George Soros to think like professionals like you did . So ,now you think like professional . I wonder if a professional trader would trade the way you describe here. That's all.

I wonder if you heard about Charles Dow, Elliot wave , Candlestick Charting Techniques. So all these theory doesn't work .  
  
I bet I am not the only one who have some fun reading you ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) . Voila, finally I found a "Trader" who said the trading theories are bullshits.  
  
This is a affront to traders here who use these theories. And guess what, some of them make money, those wich study hard in front of their desks for years. And now you give advices to the newbies what to do and what to not after you have constructed a light system like based on indicators. Do you think Soros is scalping like you ?  
  
Imagine Warren Buffet looking on the chart, the free platform MT4 and stalking for C4 igniter to trigger ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1) . Isn't that funny ?  
  
Phew...I know you feel bad about my critics but there's some truth in them. Trading isn't easy, that's why on ForexFactory and not only, are thousands trading systems wich doesn't work.  
  
I wonder if someday , somebody here will create a thread with title "Personal study of the market - everybody welcomed" . 

Money moves the market, not an indicator.

Getting into the right frame of mind and keeping the perspective  
  
the carpenter and the wood carver are two men working with same material.while one creates a practical product,the other creats an impractical thing of beauty.  
  
The auto repair man ia a greasy workman that fixes broken down cars.the mechanic is a stylized tinkler that improves on already fine tuned cars.while one fixes the broken,the other improves the better.  
  
A soldier is a trained professional whose purpose is to defend what is rightfully his.a merecenary is a trained killer whose purpose is to use his training and experience to make money.for one defending is the cause.for the other,the cause is to defeat  
  
the professional soccer player is one man on two missions.he plays for his club to make money and win prizes.he also strives to play for his country to win honor.for him,doing one job well creates two opportunities but his focus is still the same.  
  
The trader has more than one way to make money,which way will you trade?

wealthPro, having been doing this for a number of years now, I want to applaud you for your nice clean system. Not too many indicators. With practice, it should be effective for many of your followers. You might consider adding a fast CCi to Clives CCi indi as a consolidation filter. Fast CCi (14?) above/below 100/-100 or perhaps 75/-75. Just a thought, since Clives CCi allows for this. Nice work!

Hi Wealthpro,  
  
You have created very good system. I have tried today and because of my mistake i have lost two trades. That is part of game. But otherwise the signals are good and very easy to understand for anyone. Appreciated. I have question - why you have kept CCI period 170 for trend why not 20. Is there any reason behind it. I have kept 20 and it gives exact signals according to your swing man. I want to understand how CCI works on your system. I have attached chart for your reference.

Hi Bomi  
as i told earlier i combine two system one is fxprime(<http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=114258>) second is c4 scalper(<http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=181900>) for my sysyem. cci 170 is for the trend direction.TRIX is for entry signal.i am trading from 1 min time frame.but you are trading from 5 min chart.if cci 20 is work for you. and cater for your need.no harm done you can use it. any way i will check it with cci 20 and let you know.  
you can see in your chart when you take cci 20 entry exit with opp signal.you wont make pips mostly you will loss.thank you

Why did you enter one bar before the signal triggered? 

Know your edge and trade within it

Ok cool. Thanks for sharing your system. Looking forward to the London open. Right now I am just tracking trades to get a handle on how the indicators work. 

Know your edge and trade within it

I don't like the way EUR/USD is moving intraday. Maybe USD/JPY will give better bang for the buck?

But otherwise the signals are good and very easy to understand for anyone. Appreciated. I have question - why you have kept CCI period 170 for trend why not 20. Is there any reason behind it. I have kept 20 and it gives exact signals according to your swing man. I want to understand how CCI works on your system. I have attached chart for your reference. Bomi {image}

Bomi, you have your CCi set to a length of 20. This system uses CCi as a trend indicator with a length of 170. The signals you are showing on your pic and not pursuant to the rules of this thread. You are using CCi as an entry tool and not a trend tool.

In my opinion, wealthPro, you will be better off leaving CCi at 170 on a M5 chart. You are using CCi as a trend filter. When you set it at 34, you are not getting trend. You will find yourself trading pullbacks that you do not want to trade. I understand your logic -- 170/5 = 34. What will you set CCi to on a M15 chart? 170/15 = 11? Again, not a trend filter. Leave CCi at 170. My opinion only.

Not really, you only BUY when CCI is green, and when TRIX switches to green.

Hi mate  
I don`t think one Day testing is give you a whole picture from a system good or bad even a week or two  
yes maybe not working for your style of trading or just not used properly  
but I can tell you this   
with this system I open a brand new Live account yesterday (when I check the system I see the potential wright of way ) and from yesterday LO open and today LO open I made 74% profit on my LIVE £500 account from two session trading  
So yes for me IT IS A WINNING SYSTEM ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
Thank you Wealthpro for the system and god bless you   
  
just my two cent  
Alex

Here is what I have done to make this a bit better. I have moved over to the 5min chart. I have taken CCI off the chart entirely. Time of day is very important. Trading the first few hours of london open, and US open made it a profitable day.

Hello Al,  
In utilizing what you use for trading on your 1 minute chart, I thought that before I posted to the thread, I wanted to make sure that you were ok with some suggestions I would like to make.  
First, I would add four important levels to your Trix indicator, at levels, 0.03, -0.03, 0.1 and -0.1. These will used to determine the strength of a particular move and second, will give you the ability to exit your current trade before you get an arrow going in the opposite direction.  
Second, I would eliminate the bottom CCI chart and use a 50 and 200 ema average to let you know how the market is in relationship to those averages.  
Now, for the trading idea(s): I would still use the up or down arrow to get into a trade and then watch the Trix indicator as it moves up to the 0.03 0r -0.03 lines (there is no special reason why these numbers were suggested, but through eyeballing a chart it appears to be a threshold that the indicator should get through to show some strength.) The key to finding out whether there is strength in the market is to make sure that the indicator is strong enough to go above those lines. If it can't, most probably you have two things going on, first, the market is going to go in the opposite direction because of where price is in relation to the two ema's or the market is in a very quiet time and best not trade. So, when that indicator goes above or below that =/- 0.03 level when it reaches it's apex or nadir and it starts backing off in the next bar from its extreme I would exit the trade. In general one will do better this way than waiting for a reverse signal. Now, will there be times when the indicator backs off and price continues in the same direction, the answer is yes, but, if one is looking to grab a piece of the pie and you did, then you did well.  
Finally when the indicator goes over the +/- 0.10 levels you have an extreme situation where again when the bar pulls back from those levels, I would suggest exiting, even though you might not get the highest or lowest price, you will for sure make some money.  
So, Al, there you have it, a way to help protect and keep some of those profits that come your way without having to give back too much or have a loss.  
  
Let me know what you think or if you have any questions.  
  
All the best and great job of setting up this thread idea.  
  
WGT

One other thing that crossed my mind.  
  
The above approach to trading using your indicators will give good results on non trending days, which occur anywhere from 70-80% of the time.  
  
When the trending day shows up, watch the indicator (I have a sense that once price starts on its merry way, and I feel it should hang above/below the 0.03 level while the move is in progress. There of course will be times when price will zoom the indictor above/below 0.10, but when it takes a respite, it should hang around (above/below) that +/- 0.03 level, at which point I would consider reentering the market if you know or sense it is a trending day.  
  
Also, look for the divergence that the peaks of the indicator makes with the peak of price. It might help you get a sense what the next direction the market might take.  
  
Hope that helps and wish all green pips.

yeah...didn´t took long for it to happen.   
  
Maybe all the people trying to "improve" should just let a system be a system.  
Obviously it works like it is for OP.   
Obviously it doesn´t matter which indicators you delete or add and whatever secret settings they would need..  
  
you will not get 100% .. ever ...  
  
from time to time it´s quite amusing when you come back here , look at those new system threads.. and they develop the same way like they did last year or the year before or ..   
  
good luck guys

Wealthpro created this thread two days ago and already people are adding indicators and changing the system.  
  
I take it everyone making these changes have tested their theories rigorously and know the adaptions they are making will improve the returns to Wealthpro's system.  
  
Because, if you haven't, I would suggest you do this testing before posting other wise no one is going to know which method to Trade.

Hi FX Compass,  
  
I get that you are only trying to improve the system but how do you know it needs improving have you forward tested it and found it doesn't work as you where expecting?  
  
If you have tested it over how many weeks have you been testing?  
  
Do you have records of the testing you have done on the original system and the adaptions you are proposing?  
  
What improvements are you seeing in terms of % return?  
  
Do you see where I'm coming from?  
  
If it isn't broke stop trying to fix it!

Wealthpro - First, Nice Work.  
This caught my eye as it had some of the same thoughts as a 1min system that I use. In following with 'cigarguy' and 'wiseguytrade' - I actually agree that the CCI indicator might have you not getting all the potential of the trades and also, potentially not giving you enough info to make good risk management decisions. On the attached chart I have the following:  
200EMA  
50 BB w/ 2 Dev  
50 BB w/ 3 Dev  
50 %R with a 5SMA attached  
\+ Your TRIX  
My normal thought is to Enter a trade when Price is in or coming just out of the BB Channel and the %R is moving out of its OB/OS area. The 50 and the 200 lines then act as guidelines to improve the profit/risk model of the trade. With the addition of the TRIX I have been able to find a few more entry points and points where I close out when the extreme range areas have not been met.  
I trade both Trend and Counter Trend to the Longer Range Charts... I think you should have an idea where to start each morning on direction, but after that let price be your decider. I 100% agree that you should only scalp during active sessions. I try to close my ST trading by 1/2 way between the London Close and the NY Close - as guideline.

I agree! and I am always timid to post .... but I have traded for a living since 1988 and I started using the BB Bands and %R 15 years ago and I am still here! I think the suggestion by 'cigarguy' is all I was leading on. His posts speak for them selves...

people just take charts from the current day and choose indicators that would have worked on the left side of those chart. But everyday it's a new game, so they change indicators every day. So just when they think they have found the right key, the market suddenly changes the lock. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)

I like this strategy because it keeps losses small and has the potential to let profits run and get a home run every once in a while.. Trend-days are gonna be fun with this strategy, coz it makes sure that you are going with the trend.

Hey Wealthpro, really impressive thread.  
  
Please advise which type of trading account to use for better implementation of this strategy. Do you prefer an ECN account with tight [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") or a normal account with regular spreads?  
  
Also please tell us what type of account you used when you did three month live testing.

Hello Wealthpro, I'm very impressed by your system. I have never tried scalping before. I have a question, if you can please advice me ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
You have a 20 pips per day goal right? What happens on losing days? When you lose 20 pips do you stop trading for that day? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

i design this system to make 20 pips a day with minmal risk. my maximum sl is 12 pip per trade. but normall when you exit opp signal you loss less. i trade from LO open to newyork close.very rare to losing day. what you do is trade untill get 20 pips or your time perid. and accept your loss .then try to recover another day.most of the day you can catch more than 20 pips. look EURUSD,USDJPY,GBPUSD,EURJPY no other currencies.you set up these four currency pair.wait for the right set up.avoid near news trading. all high,medium impact news must be avoid.then you will be ok.dont take two trades same time.just one trade at a time.

Thanks for the quick reply ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
So you keep trading until the New York close even if you lose more than 20 pips? (For an example let's say even if you lose 50 pips?) ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Thanks again ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) I will demo this system to gain confidence ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) What I really like about this system is that it let you cut your losses quickly and get more profit by riding the trends until you get an opposite signal ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f973.png?v=15.1)

This system gives lot of fake signals. You loose -5, -5, -5, - 5pips, and after all day sitting in front of computer you catch the move for +20 pips and you are on 0.

I think one should start your trade the bar after the arrow showed up/down, because the arrow can 'repaint' on the 1st bar.  
Maybe WEALTHPRO can comment on this one plse.

have a look at the structure of the market, it's stuck in a range. So how can one expect large profits from a trend following system when market is moving sideways?  
  
Trends will come, one good trend pays for it all.

Hi wealthpro, thanks for sharing your system ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1) as i'm also full time trader and scalping, your system could give me interesting confirmation to my existing system ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) and may be we are not so far together ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
One question about one of your trade, see pic below, according only to your system and the cci the 2 entries was correct even more risky because cci is not full green so not a strong trade, so why you did not choose the first entry ? or may be you did as well !?  
  
Stay green   
โชคดีครับ

GUYS I AM NOT PROFESSIONAL TRADER.I AM NOT GURU. SIMPLY I AM A PROFITABLE TRADER  
  
ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT TRADING  
  
* Price either goes up or down.  
* No one knows what will happen next.  
* Keep losses small and let winners run.  
* POSITION SIZE = RISK / STOP LOSS  
* The reason you entered has no bearing on the outcome of your trade.  
* You can control the size of your loss (skill) but you can't control the size of your win (luck).  
* You need to know when to pick up your chips and cash them in.  
  
Expectancy = (Probability of Win * Average Win) - (Probability of Loss * Average Loss)   
  
You can not control the probabilities of wining or losing.  
  
You can not control your average win size.  
  
The only part of the equation of the equation that you can control is your average loss size.  
  
  
learning from michael schumacher will not make make you a great driver like him  
training under beckham will not gurantee that you will bend it like him  
  
learning from michael jordan will not promise you the air up there.and if you do become like jordan,beckham and schumacher the conditions that you will be competing under,will be diffrent from that of their time.so how will you fare then?  
you owe yourself the kind of training and discipline that molded the likes of MJ,MS.they took what they learnt and made it their own.  
  
their successes have been on the back of hard work,constant practice,iron discipline with pure grit and determination and proper coaching.  
  
what you owe yourself is a proper education in the art of trading that will stand the test of time and market forces.  
  
you need to learn the basics and move forward from there.  
you have to identify the kind of trader you are and what suits you.  
you have to forge the foundation on which your trading experiences will come from  
you need a group to keep in touch with,to grow and advance beyond the basics  
you need confidence,motivation and stamina to stay the course  
you need do get real and stop kidding yourself that you can be a profitable trder after a week of trading.

Hello wealthpro  
Many thanks for sharing your set up here, it looks just what i am looking for.  
I am relatively new to trading but i am home all day and scalping seems to fit me best.  
I am profitable at the moment but only by a small amount as i am only using a £1000 trading account to start me off.  
I tend not to use too many indicators but i am learning to rely on what the charts are telling me.  
  
Could i ask you some questions which will probably sound silly but i need to ask.  
All the download files on page 1, are they all compatible with my MT4 trading platform?  
Next, do all of those go in the indicator folder or is there another place needed for some of the files?  
  
Many thanks again

> Hello wealthpro Many thanks for sharing your set up here, it looks just what i am looking for. I am relatively new to trading but i am home all day and scalping seems to fit me best. I am profitable at the moment but only by a small amount as i am only using a 1000 trading account to start me off. I tend not to use too many indicators but i am learning to rely on what the charts are telling me. Could i ask you some questions which will probably sound silly but i need to ask. All the download files on page 1, are they all compatible with my MT4 trading...
> 
> Ignored

no problem , all these indicators only can use with MT4.  
  
all .ex4 idicators other than EASERVANT goes to INDICATOR folder  
EASERVANT goes to EXPERT folder  
.tpl goes to TEMPLETE  
  
this EASERVANT function is auto matically put 12 pis SL and TP,LOCK PIPS. (SL,TP can be change).i belive this one clear your doubts

@wealthpro  
  
For the last hour or so i have been looking back through last weeks charts on my platform to see how the indicators work etc.  
  
Now i need to know if i am correct in thinking that there are times and opportunitys in your system where you can enter a trade without having to see an arrow signal.  
  
On your +12 pip chart (post 131) there looks like an opportunity to grab a few more pips.  
At date and time " 13th sept 1600" There is no arrow indicating a sell, but both the trix and cci are showing red, and the chart backs up that this would be a viable sell  
Am i correct with this?  
I understand the safest way is by using the arrows as entry and exits, but does the system allow for "thinking on your feet" with what you see the charts and indicators telling you...

Another question i have  
I am just running this strategy on a demo account and when i opened a position it didnt automatically set the stop loss  
Probably me doing something wrong, i used the normal way of opening a trade in MT4

You can't open an .ex4 file. Only .mq4 can be opened.

Not having much success in the first 4 hours of testing, but I think the problem is me and not the system  
I am down 30 pips at the moment on a demo account  
  
The first problem is it is not an ECN demo so i think the spread is not helping  
Next problem is I started trading 2 hours before london opened (my puppy got me up at 5 am so thought i would make use of the time)  
I keep trying to second guess the signals  
Each time i have entered a trade based on the signals and the colour of the indicators (green green or red red) they have gone against me within the first few minutes  
  
I am now going to set it up on my laptop on an ECN demo account and run it through a few days and iron out my problems  
I really like the look of it and when i checked back through charts over the weekend the signals were pretty accurate

Hiya, not at the moment no....I have just worked out how to have both my demo and live account running on the same PC.  
The demo account i was using this morning was for a different broker and it wasnt an ECN account.  
This new one is...I'll trial it for a couple of days and get back to you.  
To be honest with you i think the problem was me this morning.

Hi  
I understand that this system gives profits on 1 min trading.. but my spread for eg - GBPUSD is 1.4.. Is it ok to trade in 1 min?

Here is another EA for setting TP & SL. Three things about this one are, you can set TP & SL in fractions of one pip. i.e.: 2.5 pips. Add 0 to all settings. 100=10 pips.  
  
It also hides you TP & SL from the broker.  
  
But the real beauty of this one, is you can adjust the settings, while trade is in progress, including trailing.  
  
I just took a demo trade, with original TP & SL set to 10 pips. During the trade, while it was in profit, I reset EA to 250 (25 pips) TP, & -60 (+6 pips) SL. On retrace, trade was closed out @ 4.4 pips in profit. Note; The one minute candle that triggered the close, was 11 pips. Some times the price volatility can create some slippage, but usually not more than a pip or two.  
  
Here's what that looks like in EA:

wealthpro, EAServant has a "lock profit" function. Can you explain how it works? Its set to 25 pips. Does it mean it sets SL= open price when it moved 25 pips? Thkx

if you set lock profit 25 pips. when reach 25 pips it will lock 1 pip after that every 1 pip increment it will lock 1 pip. if you put 5 pip lock profit when reach 5 pip it will lock 1 pip then each 1 pip increment it will lock 1 pip.

Hi WP, nice system. I appreciate your insights re. risk. I would not read your thread otherwise. Curious on your execution method- I know your are trading via the razor account- are you using the web platform or the Ctrader client? If you have tried both, do you find any difference in execution?

Must say that it looks promising,  
  
Is it possible to write any kind of ea for this?  
  
The problem by me is that i dont have the time to watch the charts all day long.   
  
Hope someone can write a EA for this

do you use some kind of method to filter out the ranging/choppy markets?  
Because there are so many systems that work in trending markets, but the trick is to filter out the sideways action properly.

The repainting arrows keep on catching me out....... even if I always wait for the close of the arrow candle.   
The arrow can still disappear 1 or 2 bars down the line.  
Thank u...... Good system where the spread is super low...... but I hardly get any spread below 6 points (EU),

Wealthpro, not trying to find fault with your system..... but I went back and check all settings of all indicators, etc, on my 1 min timeframe.  
I entered into a buy trade on the open of the bar after the buy arrow..... trend cci was green...... as the price started dropping below the level where the buy was entered.... I noticed the buy arrow was gone. Is this normal .... is no one else experiencing this?

Using this system on the M5 timeframe but not having a lot of luck with it, what conditions keep you from taking all the signal that's displayed. I'm following the rules but there's quite a few poor trades flagged as possible good trades?

If you hit the 12 pips SL you stop for that day or you just continue until you hit your target of 20 pips profit?

Hello wealthpro!  
You can show your trades on a better way. In the tab "History" you will find all your trades listed. You can drag and drop these trades with the cursor of your mouse (left mouse button) onto the charts. By this way the entry and exit of the trades are clearly shown.

just go to trix indicator change the count bar to 50,000 or more. with left,right cursor you can do that.it take some time.this is the best backtesting( IMHO)

Great strat Wealthpro, thank you.  
  
Just a quick question, would we consider taking this trade if the Trix shows an arrow and a few bars later the CCI starts in an up trend, see pic below.

Sorry this reply was not to you, it was to someone who posted to this thread asking about "any trades today". I asked for the guidelines about your system that you posted here, I am practicing on it on a demo account.

Wealthpro,  
  
When/if you have time and opportunity, could you post your trades more often (with the new rainbow template as well). Also, is the EUR/USD the only pair you trade?

Even though I am following the posts in the thread, I have not seen this question answered:  
  
Do you thingkthe indicator (TRIX) is equally effective in other timeframes, like 5 or 15 minutes?

Hi  
I let develop an EA to this strategy by mql5. name: Easy Scalper EA. The rules are the same as your idea Satish FxP-C4.  
  
Easy Scalper EA:  
TRADING RULES  
  
MAIN INDICATOR IS CLIVE CCI IF IT IS GREEN ONLY TAKE LONG IF IT IS RED ONLY TAKE SHORTS  
  
CCI 170 GREEN TAKE THE BUY SIGNAL ON SWING MAN ALTRA SUPER TRIX BUY SIGNAL (when arrow stay and the candle closed!), EXIT ON TRIX OPP SIGNAL (when arrow stay the candle closed) or when it is breakeven or traillingstop.  
  
for SHORT-Trades: opposite of the buy condition  
  
-EA take the trades after london open (i need to set the time) untill newyork close ((i need to set the time)  
-avoid new trades 15 min before and after news with middle and high impact. When a trade open before 15 min, then we let him run trough the news - but no open a new trade.  
  
You can find the indicators on:  
<http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=606433>  
  
smsuper TRIX setting 3,2,2,1,0 (i need to set)  
clive cci setting trend cci 170 (i need to set)  
\- SL 12 (12 PIPS= i need a parameter to set),  
\- TP 100 (100 PIPS = i need a parameter to set)  
\- Parameter for: Breakeven when for example 4 Pips  
\- Parameter for: Traillingstop when for example 5 Pips  
\- Parameter for: fixed lot  
\- Parameter for: Risk percentage of free margin to trade  
\- Parameter for: Allowed Spread = example 15.0 - maximum allowed spread (in points) to open a trade  
-Parameter for: Slippage = example 3.0 - maximum allowed slippage (in points) to open a trade  
\- Parameter for: martingalsystem  
  
Attention: 1. you need to install the "FFCal.ex" to indicators. The other indicators must be install (<http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=606433>)  
.  
2\. You can make backtest, but without the newsfilter-function (this works ony on forwardtest)  
  
Let us make this system profitable. Let us develop a good EA :-).   
Notice: I am not developer. I let it develope. Maybe we need a developer.  
  
  
Greats  
beat

GBPUSD is moving sideway, so I think it's good to stop trade 

Risk comes from not knowing what you're doing.

Hello,  
  
if I may add something. Remove the light blue line. You really don't need them. And it looks clearer too.

Hey Wealthpro  
The fault can be: in mt4 "indicators" must be "Clive's Histogram CCI.ex4" and not "Clive's Histogram CCI (2).ex4" as we can download here.   
Try or check experts tab for any error like powermania said...  
The EA works well, but strategy is at the moment not profitable, when you go in on every signal, like you describe - it gives to many entries in choppy market. Better less and good entries. It is only my opinion... you can test yourself. Maybe someone can bring a good idea for this.  
  
Here the .mql file.

Alex, why are you posting your chart with different indicators here? Its not related to the OPs strategy and you might just bringing confusion. Better make your own thread.

even if you got permission, whats the point of posting completely different indicator? Its fine if you have different in your chart but at least you should use the main indicator posted by him.The OP presented an strategy and indicators for us to learn and practice by using it. This not an interactive trading section.

If you dont get the picture then I just give up  
But I tell you   
you don`t need indicator or any magic Ea to trade succesfull in forex  
just learn read charts analyse them make your own stile and DON`T FOLLOW OTHERS  
what Is working for me maybe it`s not for you  
don`t look indicators look empty charts (trend,strenght,directions,price actions....etc)  
its a game a good one if you know what you doing then.......  
  
  
thank you

Yes shure  
  
it`s tooslow thread <http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=590623>  
  
I use it because I`m scalping Daily highest high and lowest low prises  
but if you go there you can read about it and down load them all  
giving you option to choose time frames  
show you daily hourly high and low opens  
basic but powerfull  
  
good tools to have  
Cheers

absolutely mate  
  
it`s part off my system  
  
but first before I start trading in the morning I doing my home work (Chart analysis W,D,H4,news for the day)prepare for the actions  
and after my morning coffe I start trading....  
one more thing   
for reversal catching I use Brain The Boss SNR indicator and fibo swing trade indicator to confirm my analysis   
I use indicators just to confirm   
I like read and analyse charts and when I take a trade and its going on my direction those fillings keep me going..........  
(not like last night when a crash happent )  
any how  
so I use my experience and tons off hours what I learned in the past try learning and accepting my mistakes and just take what ever the market throwing for us  
  
all the best  
Alex

Hi Wealthpro.  
I just following your thread by chance 2 days back after crawling to find something for new like me. I want to make some pip each day that the plan. Im practicing on demo. It works some but still not yet reach. Then i start reading more and more because im trading on 1M. I did open naked chart 1H and 4H to see how it can go for the day. I did manual back test, it really works.  
  
Alexforex541,  
You open up my eyes on how to read the trend for the day.  
  
Thanks to all.

I recommend this for New buys and every one who series about trading.....  
  
Each player has a few hundred or a few thousand dollars on the playground that no one will pay attention to.   
There are tens of thousands of players playing online. All of their orders combined could worth less than one order from a bank.   
  
To be a player, you must hand in your game plan so your enemy knows where to attack if it worth the effort.   
But you can not attack your enemy because u have no power.

Thanks for posting these Alex, I am very interested to see how the SnR will work on the DAX. I have a question though please - when I load it onto a chart it is giving me R levels but no S levels, I think that cannot be OK - can you please share the settings you use for it?  
  
Thanks again.

Hi Alex,  
  
I have it all working perfectly on some forex charts but for some reason it really doesn't like the DAX! No worries, I will look at how it all works with forex because on EU it looks great!

Great system - i use ist at 5min chart, so you can filter the tont of choppy Signals in m1... also have a look at the Pivot points  
  
i use the first system with cci - why did you change wealthpro?  
  
i think the best is to add a indicator for momentum - so you can see if the market will go or stay in range, which one - i dont know, maybe you have an idea  
  
with the ema-rainbow template i have the feeling, sometimes youre too late in the trade... but you can explain, did not tried..  
  
  
peferctly could be, when we had the Trio-Swing Indikator with push-alerts... so we donthave to stay at the Monitor all the time...  
  
my favorite Paris are eurusd, usdjpy, usdchf, audusd  
  
usually its enough to take the first right signal (rules!) after the London and the next after the new York open...  
  
  
maybe someone can post the trix-indi with push alerts?

I read Too Slows threads all the time and will get round to it soon as it can be another string to my bow on some forex pairs.  
  
I see that TS posted a new template and some indis today and hopefully I'll get around to looking at that later.

Ok guys I give up  
seems like no one wants to participate here   
I stop posting here   
Seems like people come here to look when they see green pips they think we have a magic indicator or something   
well  
WE DON`T  
YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO READ A CHARTS WITH OUT ANY INDICATOR AND FIND YOUR WAY TO TRADE  
Then and only then use some indicators witch is fit your trading style  
so have a nice day   
all the best

Hi wealthpro,  
  
How about incorporating Elder's impulse system with this one... seems like to work very well with back testing.

Hello wealthpro,  
  
following the thread with interest! due a lot of false alerts (alerting at open, not at closed candle), and so a win loss ratio at 1:2 over the last days i want to change to the M5 TF.  
But Actually i've an issue with SwingMan UltraSuperTrix_MTF you posted... This Version don't do any alerts... The other one is alerting, but not the mtf one...  
any Ideas?  
  
Thanks in Advance ! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Hi  
lemme ask a question about ur suggested time for make pips. u mean we can trade on NY and London sessions. it means we trade just under yellow and violet DotDot Dashed horizontal line. im i right?  
and take away from any DotDot vertical line for 15 minutes? (before and after) 

You have enemies? Good. That means you've stood up for something, sometime

Hi Wealthpro, i know as you can see i have only just joined forex factory, but i have been studying and trying to learn as much as i can for the last two years about the forex world, so i still consider myself very much a newbie!. My problem is, is that i have loaded up your template and all the indicators etc, but i can't get the EA to work!, i changed the parameters to 10 profit,10 stop loss and 5 lock in. But when i initialize it i get an unhappy face in the top right corner instead of a happy face?, i've checked the journal,experts etc and can't find any error codes, i just wondered if you might know what the problem might be. Many thanks for your time and all the best for the future.
