The **Skill** and **Will** was always there but I was missing certain factors to increase my win rate, to save my equity, to act accordingly, understanding the present state of market correctly, considering which technicals are suits my trading style and which are not and most importantly closing my day in a profit even it is very small and exiting the market for the day.  
  
I was fine tuning my method [here](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=462726).  
  
Finally, my method produced a combination of systems which I call **Rekon Xs and Market Scanner Combo**! The Xs are the missing factors which I have included in the Rekon Xs template file and Market Scanner is a software I developed to help me extract out all the bad instruments for trading and only give me a safe list to trade for the hour.  
  
This system has all potential to go far - furthest! The win rate for me is > 90% at the moment, however, it will ofcource vary person to person, so there is a way to how to measure your winrate for the day and how to take care of your win rate and grow it, I will explain more about it later.  
  
**Instruments:** This is a 24 * 5 market for us, the intraday traders, so we need to be very careful about selecting the right instrument to trade at the right time, for example there is no point of trading Appel Stocks in Asian session, it can only be best traded in the US session.

_**Rekon Xs Trade Videos**_  
  
**Volume 1:** This series is going to focus on the very basic set ups which appears time to time even the forex market is truly random. What we will do is, once we get signal from Market Scanner, we will start looking at these kind of set ups for the "Hot-Listed" Instruments.  
  
For Binary, we will look for 30 Mins expiry and for Spot forex atleast 50 points profit on 5 digit broker.  
  
**Please note:** This is only one hour strength of the instruments, so do not overdo trading, get the pips and exit from the market for the hour.  
  
**Suggession:** You can turn on the auto scanning feature of Market scanner to 25 mins and do trading at a strech of 2 hours, however, I would suggest our mission is to close the day in profit, so as soon as you are in profit - you exit and that should be the only vision here. We are not here to challange any individual or the market, just want to take my profit and exit the day so that we can come back again on next day.

_**Rekon Xs Risk Table**_  
  

  
But, before using Risk Table, I must have consistent Win rate, otherwise it has no use. I will talk about Win rate later, so I see this a different game for Part-timers and full-timers. Full timers can take more risk based on their win rate and can exponentially grow their equity, whereas a part-timer must know his limitation and restrict himself from taking unnecessary risks like overtrading, risking bundle of moneys on a single trade etc. more on that he must exit the market for the day --  
  
A. If he is early winner for the day, should not come back again to the market  
B. If he lost 3 trades at a row.  
  
**Suggession:** A Part timer must not gamble with the market, must be very careful on his win rate, so instead of multiple entries he should care about winning single position.

_**Rekon Xs WinRate**_  
  
Our overall Win Rate decides how much risk we should take. Even the professional gamblers only put his all money when he sure about the odd and he knows about his win rate ratio, if anything bad happens after that then we can atleast tell ourselves that we lost even we did all the right things and thats a bad luck, can not do anything just except the fact that you have tried based upon best possible information you had at that time. Then we need to further engage ourselves for the cause and if we able to find, we will also consider that fact from next time onwards.  
  
Here is a sample form, which helps to maintain our win rate ratio on daily basis, continuing this practice is very helpful particularly for which instrument we should trade more which we should not etc.

_**Rekon Xs NonPerformers**_  
  
As we need to track our win rate on daily basis, similarly we need to keep monitoring the instruments which are performing good with your existing strategy whatever it is, before you consider approaching for any new method you should test it atleast 3 months and you will get a group of high performers and non-performers.  
  
On your live account, you simply go with the high performers and avoid the non-performers, this simple trick will boost your win rate for sure.

_**Rekon Xs Technicals**_  
  
Will now discuss about the Rekon Xs trading template components. These technicals works combinely to create a tradable set up. Once we receive signal from the Market Scanner, we try to look out for the confirmation received by the technicals. We only trade the pattern we able to recognise.  
  
**Credit:** All the technicals / components in the chart are based upon old studies of technical, nothing new only I have tried optimizing certain settings thats all, so Credit goes to the great people such as** J. Welles Wilder, George C. Lane, Tushard Chande and Stanley Kroll, Gerald Appel , Larry Williams, Donald Lambert, Dr Alexander Elder. **

**1\. Moving Averages:** 220 EMA on Close, 800 SMMA on Close, 8 EMA (Trigger) on Close.  
  
If I remove almost of all other technicals except filters, we will see 220 and 800 together indicates a strong trend, and 8 is the short term direction. So trades will be based on direction of 8.  
  
**1 A.** Now, we will get with trend entries which are more safe, when 8 agrees with 200 and 800. But then how do you time the trades? For that you need to look out the other 4 windows/filters.  
  
1\. Volume: Watch for a volume spike first, after that you need to look out for entry.  
2\. Filters 1 (Rekon Xs - RSX),2 (RCCI), 3 (RMACD) must agree the same trade direction  
  
**1 B.** When 220 and 800 are close together, we see a ranging market, the more ranging continues the more possibility increases for a strong break out.  
  
**1 C. RMACD:** Must not be considered as reversal sign, it prompts early for possible trend change, but in a strong trend it will keep on creating hidden divergences for each short term price retracements. Therefore, only its cross up or cross down should be considered as signal of possible change of trend direcion.

_**Rekon Xs Trade Timing**_  
  
My trading time is Indian Standard Time. I find the following timings are good for trading and I will be following these timings for lifelong and will not consider trading in other times.  
  
In case I am already a winner trading in Time A, I will consider calling it a day and will not trade in the same account, in case I am managing multiple accounts I will also consider trading the Time B but will not trade on the winning account.  
  
A. 12:30 PM to 3:30 PM  
B. 7:30 PM to 10:30 PM

_**Rekon Xs Technicals (..contd.) # 2**_  
  
So, to identify the major trend we will first have the MA direction. Then we will confirm the direction by the filters (Rsxs, RCCI, RMACD)  
  
The order of looking at the price will be  
  
A. MAs direction  
B. RCCI is Red and crossing down  
C. Rsxs are down  
D. RMACD crossing down  
  
We will search for entry when there is a volume spike or recent Volume spike.  
  
A. With Volume spike, price was up, in next candles volume is decreasing but price is continuing up = Buy  
B. With Volume spike, price was Down, in next candles volume is decreasing but price is continuing down = Sell

_**Rekon Xs Technicals (..contd. # 3)**_  
  
**Support / Resistance Levels:** When the market is trending and it is a strong selling market, we will notice price consolidates on the support levels and generally a strong trend breaks the support levels and they turns resistance level.  
  
**Binary Entries (Sell Market):** Once candle closed below the support level and next candle opening is under the support level we will take "Put" Option.

_**Rekon Xs Technicals (..contd. # 4)**_  
  
**Fib Levels:** For Binary Option we will do counter entry on 61.8 level, which will be basically a with-trend entry for the main trend. Other important levels are 78.6 and 23.6.

_**Rekon Xs Technicals (..contd. # 5)**_  
  
_**Geometric Mean Levels and Pivots:**_ These all are basically averages which we need to be careful, specially for binary options because price has a tendency to come back these levels. When price touches these levels always a "with trend" entry has a higher success rate than "Counter entry"

_**Rekon Xs Technicals (..contd. # 6)**_  
  
_**Signals:**_ Rekon Xs template, I call it a signal factory, which combines price actions, reversal and divergences alert, but until you are expert on (Technicals 1 to 5) you will find difficulty acting on the correct signal.  
  
For Spot this will still work good but for Binary on forex you really need to understand the signals.   
  
Back Testing is very important and you will need a simulator for this.

Market is best, when it creates a co-relation harmony, it means when a particular currency gains strength against almost of all its other pairs.

Next, is you need to identify the good set up.   
  
1\. Once you get the signal, there is no need to hurry, it is one hour signal, you got the instrument, now just be careful about watching the instruments carefully and take a good entry.  
  
2\. Only select the instrument with good set up

I am not trading at the moment, but you guys can try the latest forex signals. In my view it is a non-performing market at the moment.

_**Rekon Xs: Use the News**_  
  
It is imporatant that you try to search for news for the stock which you want to trade for intraday or binary, and **Use the News** to determine the trade direction.

As per my broker time, the Asian market will close at 10:00 GMT. So this entry on binary survived for around 4 hrs, proving with trend entries has higher success rate if you get a good entry point and use the news on the favour of the entry.

A. Should see this as a business which grows with your maturity, person who want to be rich in overnight will fail for sure.  
B. You need to see this as a method, rather than a system.  
C. A system is **as good or as bad** as you are.  
D. This is not an automated procedure, but a series of analysis we are doing and by doing that our success rate is > 90%.

_**Market Scanner and OverBought or Oversold Signals**_  
  
3 or more Overbought / Oversold signals from the main technicals (first 11) are indication of Contra trend (should not read as reversal).  
  
Here H5 has indication of Contra signals (Yellow), and you need to look out for entries pivot or below levels.

For expiry on 15 minutes, you need to check 15 minute chart, for expiry on 30 minutes you need to check 30 Minutes chart.   
  
If you are asking about "Market Scanner" then the task should be more easy now, as we have multi time frames, so we will consider looking at 15 minutes, 30 mins and H1 for expiry on or less than one hour.

*****_Important Observation Market Scanner Multi Time Frame_ *****  
  
  
Yesterday, I was trying demo spot entries based on currency strength M30 and lower time frame. With that I tried ignoring rekon X template for spot forex.  
  
Result is not good.  
  
So, in case you have received the latest copy of market scanner application and trying timeframe less than H1, please be careful and pay extra attention on not doing random entries based on Market Scanner Signal, rather take it as a "direction" and find the entry from rekon X template or whichever template you follow.  
  
  
Thanks.

Hourly strength is also suggesting "No Trade"  
  
So, we will wait for another hour and rescan the market, in the mean time the broker will load more instruments for trading.

For trending it is more simple, all you need is a price spike or retracement up to have "With Trend Entry".  
  
1\. Follow S/R levels   
2\. Fib levels 23.6, 61.8  
3\. Price Action Reversal signals DCC, Engulf etc.  
  
Hope this helps.

Try to manually delete the "Volume - Levels" from the Volume indicator, it is not helping visually to see it clear.

Hi, you need to read this entire thread to understand how I am using RekonX template and Market Scanner Application for trading spot and binary.  
  
Now, to answer your questions clearly,  
  
A. Timeframe: you can use it for M30 to Daily, I will recommend only two timeframes for intraday spot or binary which are M30 and H4.  
  
B. Binary Option trading: Indian Standard Time 11:30 AM to 3 PM, 7:30 PM to 10:30 PM  
  
*** Please do not overtrade, specially for binary, have a monthly goal and try to exit the market as soon as you are winner even with a single position. Follow the Risk Table to reward your equity and rescue the Equity when requires.   
  
Hope this helps.

M30 Scan.  
  
A/P and G/P sale signal with ATR high volatility.  
  
We need to check the other time frames till H5, before considering entry.

Strength is normalizing, price dropped to pivot and will go with the trend.

To the Market Scanner Users,  
  
What we are doing here is totally unique and there is no other thread available in this forum where you can see this. My believe is so far if you able to understand the whole concept I have tried describing in the entire thread then you really do not need to do anything else, all the missing Xs are covered here and with fine tuning them on daily basis we will be in the long term profitable league!  
  
So lets summarize,  
  
_**30 Mins Binary**_  
  
A. Low ATR, less than 3 Overbought signals = with trend entry around pivot / support level for BUY / CALL  
B. Low ATR, more than 3 Overbought signals = Counter entry around R2-R3 level for Sell / PUT  
  
Won 3, Loss 0 ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

except i'm misunderstaning you. you said three overbought/oversold conditions is good for with trend entry. above three could be treated as a counter trade

I will give u a detailed explanation later. I am on mobile so can not type much now. 3 exhausion signal is a definite sign of price weakness but we need to check where is the price presently. By reading the fib levels we can find that and decide whether we go for counter or with trend entry.Your trading decission is a dependent variable it is always how you read the market not others

_**Price Analysis**_  
  
**A.** Instrument is trending.  
**B.** A trending price can retrace at price exhaustion / less interest.   
**C.** A trending price can attract interest ~ will add with direction volume = Adding speed to trending direction.  
  
**"WH" questions to the above Analysis.**  
  
1\. How to detect it is trending or range bound ~ my binary will fail if I misread the market.  
2\. Where is my entry point for this instrument? ~ my binary will fail if I chose random entry points  
3\. How do I know how much the price is exhausted? Is there any indicator to show me the price exhaustion in a consolidated manner of taking different popular studies?  
4\. Price is rejecting / getting a sharp 180 degree turn or it is able to create higher highs or lower lows? Can I understand this. ~ my binary will fail if I do not understand this.

My concern is **Data** from Investing.com are **delayed** some, esp for Aussie and Indian stock and some euro stocks.  
  
eg Aussie Stock, Anz Bank

Acit - your observation is correct. About your concern of data feed delay is true but lets consider how you trade?  
  
Fib levels for h1 are not going to effect you for 30 mins binary or quick scalping in spot.  
  
What we are following is the recommended study of indicators and you are getting an easy interpretation of technical analysis.   
  
I do agree on your concern about data feed but I have not faced any trouble with that. In case you find other relaiable data source let us know.  
  
Also take trades and post here for further discussion.

Well, lets play it differently, I showed you the entire procedure of thinking and taking the trade. Can you come forward and explain  
  
A. Why I took the trade?  
B. when I took the trade?  
C. How long I monitored the trade?

A. I consider USD 10 is the minimum stake for a binary trade. (How you interpret this with your account Equity that's up to you)  
B. You are asking this question it means still you are not able to differentiate between Binary and Spot. So called Spot MM will not work here.  
C. In Binary I introduced you Risk Table which has a monthly goal, compounding and recovering power to the equity in case of loss in first position and so on.  
D. I yet to start with discussing statistical probability using in Binary and taking risk on the best ODD.

Descriptive Statistics: contd.  
  
You can visually measure / read the indicators (RSI, Stoch, CCI, ATR ..etc) ... and do a probability measure between "confirmation - with trend' and 'disagreement - counter trend'  
  
But you must need to know disagreement for RSI is not same with disagreement of Stoch rather when StochRSI disagrees the trend it gives more weightage on counter trend.

Well, if you trade in higher timeframes like H4 then the other price action patterns useful but in shorter timeframe they are not. DCC and pinbars can be traded in M30.   
  
If you want to do spot with price action then please switch to H4.

In only one month time we able to form a Market Scanner Group of users and I am happy to say all the MS systems in different geographic are now running fine.

I am inviting all MS's users to join the meeting and take most out of it.  
  
Meeting Time: 28th Feb, Friday 10:30 PM Indian Standard Time  
Meeting via: Skype and Team Viewer  
Meeting duration: 30 Mins, depends upon participation it can extends to 1 hour

It could be a good idea, but DCC success on M15 is near about 70% in my opinion, but if you able to read what the rekonX template combinly saying then the success percentage will go higer than 85%, because you will resist yourself not taking the trade blindly on DCC, and you can use other signals from other indicators as well from the template.

If we are doing with trend entry, we need to wait for the price a bit up for a better entry.

Sorry bud! I think my trading style is confusing you. I am not finding time for doing manual spot forex, therefore not finding much time to rekonXs template. Please read carefully my old posts you will get an understanding.

You need not to jump for entry, but when you see a price drop on trending buy, you go for call. Price below Pivot will be good.

High ATR = larger price range,  
  
3 oversold signal = price could retrace and try for R2, R3 level  
  
With trend entry for this will be R3-R2 level.

Market Scanner interface update: I am working on few changes on the application interface which is expected to offer you more flexible scanning and saving the time. The update is expected to roll out by next week. Thanks.

Once I convinced with daily trend for GBP pairs, I considered rescanning only GBP pairs for the hour.

I prefer scalping like this. Do not need to seat all day long, At a time one or two trade. Further if you want to seat for 1 hour to 2 hour session just repeat the steps.

**Market Scanner success rate is going to go higher exponentially!**  
  
This is going to be a long term project, however now-a-days brokers are coming with CFD options and in future Market scanner will take input from the installed MT4 only to avoid data delay. For Market Scanner Users, you can try a demo of [InstaForex](http://instaforex.com/en/index.php?x=IHEV) and try the stocks binary with MT4 chart.  
  
In case you are opening an account with InstaForex, please put affiliate code **IHEV** . Thanks.

Market Scanner's new interface is going to be like this. Where we will have 3 boxes to save instruments and run scan on a single portfolio or multiple. Expected that it will save some of our time.  
  
Thanks to one of the users of Market Scanner for the suggestion. We all should have the updated version by next week.

I rescanned with Aud pairs and USD/NOK, based on Daily Signals as posted on the above thread.  
  
Now, only consider USD/NOK to watch,  
  
on daily it has 2 oversold signals, suggesting price weakness on trend. ATR is low.  
  
on hourly all technicals are down but ATR is high. It suggests IT might try to go higher, retrace up, or a higher price will attract more sellers.  
  
Now we need rekonX template for entry.

So, I took a quick scalp on USD/NOK by taking the best odd of price retracement up.  
  
Now, as a trading strategy we can do two things  
  
A. We can place pending orders by reading Market Scanner / rekonX suggested levels.  
B. We can do scalping just as I did.  
  
C. We should not do binary in a poor performing market.

_**This thread is about to close**_  
  
  
I am here in FF for last 5 years, I always wished somebody / some thread provide me opportunity to learn forex trading in correct way because as a part time trader I have lots of constraint and every-time as a part timer I enter this market I know how much vulnerability and risk I carry by doing that.  
  
So, till date there is not a single thread which is working for providing a solution to mainly the part time traders to address and mitigate the risks they take everyday on part-time trading.  
  
I have only tried to innovate a solution for this and this is working fine.   
  
  
Somebody from FF complaint that I am selling softwares here, it is very obvious that I refused to give away all my hard work for free so the person complaint. However, that results that I might need to stop my information sharing here.  
  
In case the other users of Market Scanners, taking any trades using the application they can continue and post here for success / failure/ doubt or anything.  
  
I want to end this by concluding, if you are successful or want to be successful you must have an analytical mind and sharing attitude and that will make you different from the other losers specially who are lurking always for free goodies here in FF.  
  
Best Regards,

First of all, although I am new to this thread, I think I speak for all of us here at FF that**you cannot leave this thread rekon!!!**  
  
I've just subscribed and, to be honest, of all the threads I am subscribed to, this is the one I get the most excited about. I just discovered this thread a few days ago and already I find it unbelievable that you developed this market scanning software yourself, and I admire you for that. I am a programmer myself trying to work on a similar piece of software, but for FX not options (yet), so I know just how difficult it must have been to develop.  
  
If my opinion means anything, I would urge you to reconsider abandoning this thread as I truly believe you are on to something unique here, and I would love to be a part of it in any way, shape, or form.  
  
Whether you know it or not, there are many of us here at The Factory that are counting on your success, and it is specifically because of the willingness of people like you that we can all learn and grow together. I am certain that whatever system you've presented here is one-of-a-kind (I seriously have _never_ seen a tool that was designed specifically for binary options... and I LOVE that aspect of it) and so I just want you to know that your work inspires people like me, and it would be a shame to put an end to that.  
  
So, pleeeeeease, keep on, keepin' on! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Thx bud! You are vouching me without using the application by yourself. That feels amazing! The more positiveness will come once the actual users will start sharing there experience. Next 2 - 3 weeks I will be focusing mainly to train the users. I am sure when the people start acting as a group there will be a boosting of positive attitude. I need an environment where people will become traders and only discuss about trading methods and strategies. A big game is still pending - winning your broker so dont waste time on judging and complaining individuals, thats very non productive. With that, I just want to include how you see the trading - is that a business for you which you want to do seriously or it is only your gambling hobby?

_**Spot H4 And Above**_  
  
I would like to start with Spot H4. The method will be as below. We need to carefully note down the win-rate % for the week. A good win rate on spot will automatically boost your confidence on binary, However, Binary is a different ball game but win-rate % is primary requirement for binary.  
  
_**Method:**_  
  
**1\. With Trend Entry no counter.**  
**2\. Profit Target = Opening Price - Closing Price [in future MS will be able to give us a Target]**  
**3\. Fib Levels Entry (we will try to get a good entry by reading the fib points on H5 for H4)**  
**4\. Fib Levels Exit (We will try to exit if the price is in extreme zone.**  
**5\. Stop for Sale 10 points above R3, for Buy 10 points below S3.**  
  
  
**Lets Scan!**

I now need to do scanning in smaller Time frames to validate whether the instrument is agreeing the trend with the Higher timeframes. So here is M30 Scan.

I am selecting USD/NOK for 4 hours, although there is no strong trend at the moment for any pairs. So I am just going with the best odd.

Good morning Bro, its been a while. Nice to see your still waxing stronger by the day and still bagging those green pips. Until I can acquire the Market Scanner, I'll still be on the sideline watching. I have a lot of questions to ask concerning binary option. I'll send you a message via your yahoo mail. Until then, please continue your good work and forget about what people say because talk is cheap, that's why people talk anyhow. So don't let it stop you from helping others because we look up to you.

Presently it is really a challange for me to make time and balance my personal life, work life, trading and support for my application development. So my FF activities are very less now a days compare to earlier days. I have started a series of trading strategies now so lets hope this series will be able to answer many questions. Market Scanner is an Analytical tool so traders knowing the technicals will be able to make different personalized trading strategies based on that, my focus will be addressing the basics.

Hello Rekon.  
I'm also into binary options, I kind of stumbled into it as a newbie, lost money because I was stupid and followed the advice of a stupid 'account manager'.  
Why should an account manager be a good trader ? If he were one, he would trade on his own and not work for a company ...  
I followed blindly his advice and the result was 11 lost trades in a row, do you believe that ? That is worse than a Martingale system (gambling) which would give 50 % win-loss rate....  

Anyway, I have to read some more of your pages and then I'll come back.  
Keep up the good work ! I really appreciate it.

Your observation and experience about Account Manager is correct. Please take your time on reading the pages. Work on increasing the win rate ratio before binary

While Market Scanner is scanning the Daily strength, lets plan the H4 strategy.  
  
1\. We are going to do it for Forex only, if we see good trending there, otherwise will move to stocks.  
2\. We need to measure A. strength of the instrument , B. How long the strength is going to stay, C. Volatility  
3\. We will take one instrument and split the position into small sizes and will have different TP target today.  
  
Lets Scan the Market!

Alright, so on Daily it is a poor perming market. We got some instruments to watch, now we need to drill down further in the smaller time frames.

So, I took all GBP pairs and USD pairs in H5 bucket, but the Market is poor and technicals are mixed.

H1 is interesting, as you can see some instruments are having volatility which means volumes are coming in shorter time frame and this going to effect on higher tfs eventually.

One M30 Scan, and now we are good to select the pair for trading. By reading all the scan my observation is as below.  
  
A. CAD is week but not confirmed in shorter TFs  
B. GBP is strong but not across all TFS, and volatility in Shorter TFs  
  
C. A+B= sell G/C .. now lets see if there is any trade set up for this.

Price is on Pivot and its a Range bound Market, I placed the TP at Support 1. I want to see how long it takes to reach there, based on the situation after an hour I will decide further with all 3 opened positions.

_**Market Scanner: Update**_  
  
So this is another update in the queue. I call it "Group By" view of Multi Time frame Analysis. This I will be adding as an additional feature to look at multi time frames at once.

Hmm, only one thing I misread here, in a range bound market I should have done contra entry.

With a bad decision effect will reflect on the win-rate ratio and in the next trading session we need to take care of that.

> Thx bud! You are vouching me without using the application by yourself. That feels amazing! The more positiveness will come once the actual users will start sharing there experience. Next 2 - 3 weeks I will be focusing mainly to train the users. I am sure when the people start acting as a group there will be a boosting of positive attitude. I need an environment where people will become traders and only discuss about trading methods and strategies. A big game is still pending - winning your broker so dont waste time on judging and complaining...

Hi Rekon,  
  
Apologies for the delayed response. I got a new job recently and have been working late. It sucks, and I don't like it, but it does allow me to continue trading at least in the short-term...  
  
No doubt, you deserve A TON of credit for developing this application. Seriously. I have yet to use it but it only took me about 30 seconds to see the potential that lies here in this thread ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1) ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f647-200d-2642-fe0f.png?v=15.1)  
  
I couldn't imagine tackling something so huge by myself. Well, actually, I take that back, because I am trying to develop the holy grail EA, but it's so tough that I have a looooong ways to go still. Which is all the more reason why I find what you have done so amazing. As a programmer myself, I can relate to the difficulty you must have experienced throughout the development process.  
  
Not to mention, trading successfully and profitably is a tough endeavor. But trading OPTIONS successfully and profitably is a dozen times harder!  
  
I have been been trading for years already, but haven't found the success that I'm looking for (perhaps because my expectations are wayyy too high!), and yet, I have not given up. I'm not sure what you'd call me. I am a gambler by nature, but I love trading so much that I am _extremely_ determined to make it my career, and will not stop until I do so. Although I may seem and/or talk like a noobie, I am anything but.  
  
On a side note, I would love to work with you in any way possible.  
  
Don't know if it's out of the question to ask if there's any way I can get my hands on your software (I still have to read most of this thread, to be honest), but I would love to be a beta tester of yours and learn as much as I can from you. I am hardcore determined to succeed. I have done everything from daytrading, to swing trading, to investing, to working at a prop firm, and managing a real portfolio. I have traded stock options, binary options, FX, equities, and more but as an aggressive trader I love the constant thrill of options. I've also worked in the investment industry for a couple of years, not GS, MS, or anything like that but just managing asset allocation, reconciling returns, IT tech support, debugging, and -- primarily -- managing a software application which was developed in VBA... that kind of crap.  
  
I say all of this because my point is that I am NOT a noobie. I have advanced trading skills in my opinion, and an even better system that I developed from scratch and refined over the years, but the only reason I still struggle is because I severely lack the discipline trading requires. I also tend to give back all of my gains in the occasional drunken stuper ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44e.png?v=15.1)  
  
I once made a 3,300% return in 2 days... only to give it all back (in a drunken stuper) because I wanted 6,000%. Ugh... greed... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f923.png?v=15.1)  
  
Please write back, as I am interested in hearing your thoughts. I am a big fan of yours.  
  
**KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!!**

OMG, I can't believe you said this.  
  
You hit the nail on the head!!!  
  
Multiple Time Frame Analysis (MTFA) is at the core of my system. If you don't know what it is just google it because it's amazing and I'm not going to explain it here.  
  
There are so many people on FF who dismiss it and/or don't understand it's full potential.  
  
But their problem, as I've said before, is not so much in the system, but rather the application of that system... so essentially, how you apply it.  
  
I have got it down to perfection... and would be happy to share it with you sometime.  
  
Rekon... I think we need to work together on something. I am looking for a good programmer as a partner and I'm thinking you may be just the guy. And now I am dying to try your system ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

okey, I know you are on the right track and you are young having lots of positive potential. Right now I am in a middle of lots of unfinished business, I have a group of users for no reason they have already trusted on my project so I feel liable to introduce a set of trading strategies to them. I am a full time salaried employee to a Nasdaq listed US company so my 12 hours of the day is dedicated to them. I live alone 1580 kms away from my family so maintaining my family and spending time with them is a personal challange to me.In summation I am willing to encourage you and perhaps in near future join you but before that I need to slowly streamline all my unfinished business. This might take another 3 months and I successfully finish this season. In the next season I look forward to join hands and take it to the next level.

So this is day 3 of H4-MS strategy. I am trying to mix all the analysis so that it more left you on thinking the process. The more you question the better, when you read back this thread 3 months later your conception and experience of seeing the market will be more matured.  
  
With that vision, will start todays trading session, we will scan both forex and stocks and do only with trend entries. Will have trailing stops of 15 pips.  
  
Lets scan the market!

Important to notice is on Daily ATR or Volatility is Low means Price range is capped in small boundary, potential entry could be found where ATR for the same instruments are high in smaller TFs.  
  
However, I triggered my first batch on Daily trending. Now I will see the stocks, then in next hour will rescan in smaller TFs again.

We have 8 positions open with target to close them in next 4 hours time in profit by scaling trailing stops,  
  
A. when we see an overall percentage gain we will try to close the group.  
B. We will monitor and close individuals. This is important for us to increase our win rate%.  
  
So, I will go with option B.

With every fresh scan, we will try to close the trades which are in positive, and replace them with fresh scan result.

Important thing to notice is the changing ATR, high volatility, means volume is coming and price is going to take a ride on the direction!

On the other hand e-bay is going to be on sale, notice the price exhaustion and low ATR.

For binary another option I am thinking to include which is "Pairs", I will check this till 4 hours strength, This should work good with two strong trending on opposite direction and higher time frame.

So, considering a scenario, where H5 strength of Baidu is on BUY with High ATR and Google is not even there in the list, Google vs Baidu we go for PUT, time of expiry 2 hours to 4 hours depends upon broker.

So this one is about to expire. Probably I will test this option more and play it with a fixed set of rules.

Nice way expired.   
  
This is pair option. As a rule I just applied the followings.  
  
A. Selecting atleast one strongly trending instrument for H5  
B. The other instrument must be weak compare to the trending instrument, best is if it trends strong just the opposite.  
C. Expiry time for this one was 3 hours, we are taking H5 strength so 2 hours and more should work.  
D. Volatility: The Instrument which is trending, if it also has volatility then it will be best, as quickly it will move against the other pairs direction and will create a good gap between them.

So, with yesterdays H4 method, I have been continuously taking trades in 15 mins interval, all are "with trend only" with that particular timeframe. I was replacing the winners of that M15 with a fresh bunch.  
  
So 37 positions are winner and 14 positions remain unclosed.

Net effect on Win-rate as of now is very positive at the moment.

_**Day 4: MS H4 Strategy**_  
  
We are creating different situations and applying MS technique to increase A. our win rate, B. With better win-rate we will risk higher and try to come out from other problems / challenges.  
  
So, in last session we left with 14 opened positions. Today we will try to recover each losing position one on one basis.  
  
We will increase the stake 3 times and try for good quality entries. Lets scan the Market!

One counter entry I am selecting on eur aud, looking at exhausion signs on H5. Presently it just hit R2, it might go up to test R3 but we are going with the best odd at the moment.

So, yesterday with the last round of MS-H4 strategy, I tried to close previous losing positions one-on-one basis with a fresh position and when the aggregate of both are zero or slightly in profit then closing the group.  
  
Having said that, it means A. our winning rate ratio will be slightly down (but we can take that because we have above 90% win rate ratio at the moment), B. in long run this will be good for our equity.  
  
Due to friday market, volume and trade activity dropped after UK close, that results we still have 8 old positions opened, so in our next session with the same objective of closing the olds early we will carry on.  
  
Next Monday to friday we will be focusing on spot only after that we will move to binary strategies section, before we start binary we need to make sure that we have atleast 70% win rate.

This is for one of MS group member. As per your request, I have tried Counter entry on H5. The followings we need to look out for this strategy.  
  
_**Counter entry set up on H5**_  
  
1\. Atleast 2 Yellow sign which should be treated as only early indication of main trend weakness **but this is not a confirmation**.  
2\. ATR: High on lower TF like M15, M30, H1  
3\. Extreme Zone entry for counter: R3 is best, R2 will take some more time to show you profit.  
4\. Exit: pivot or S1.

It did not worked out, both stock falled in the last hour of US close. I will keep this on my watching list.

Hi Rekon,  
  
I am starting to read and catch up on this thread now. I agree with your statement above and would love to talk to you further! Have you only been trading and/or developing this system for the past 6 months? That is remarkable if true. I have been refining my system for 3-4 years now and continue to do so every day. I have several suggestions for you, but not sure if communicating them all here is the best method.

_**Post 362**_  
  
The above mentioned strategies I will be scrutinize more in Season 2. In season 1 main focus is to create a discussion platform on various angles of looking at the market and tackling it.  
  
I would request specially to those who are using MS, in case you want to try other strategies apart from your existing one or with your exiting one, just try all the mentioned above and post your result so that we can fine tune them further.  
  
Thanks.

You can surely add your comment and sentiment. Thing is that the materials I have I am slowly blending here and will continue the same for atleast next 2 months in season 1.  
  
This entire thread will look different in next 2 months as there will be more angles and they are waiting in the queue.

Ok Rekon. I will try to posts my comments here but I still need more catching up on this thread and I guarantee I will have a lot more comments.  
  
For now, my two biggest comments are:  

#1) **You NEED to find a way to incorporate more MTF concepts.** I can help you with this, as I have almost got it down to a science... but perhaps we can talk more and work something out b/c I'd really like to test your software and right now I don't even know how much it costs. But I'm getting the impression that you know what the f* you're talking about, and that's the kind of person I'd like to work with.

  

#2) Simpler is better. If I understand correctly -- and from what I have read -- your system uses 24 different indicators. That is wayyy too much! Simplify, simplify, simplify!

> Rekon Xs Technicals Will now discuss about the Rekon Xs trading template components. These technicals works combinely to create a tradable set up. Once we receive signal from the Market Scanner, we try to look out for the confirmation received by the technicals. We only trade the pattern we able to recognise. Credit: All the technicals / components in the chart are based upon old studies of technical, nothing new only I have tried optimizing certain settings thats all, so Credit goes to the great people such as J. Welles Wilder, George C. Lane,...

In addition to my previous post, I would add the following comments:

  1. While I agree a lot of the credit -- in fact most of it -- goes to these infamous people you have named, I would encourage you to think "outside of the box", as nothing remarkable will be accomplished inside it.
  2. I like your use of RSX, RCCI, and RMACD as that is pretty unique and I don't see it used much, but I'm not entirely sure if it's much different from RSI, CCI, and MACD. My view is that any indicator can be effective if applied correctly, though some are better than others.
  3. I strongly prefer the stochastic indicator over RSI/RSX, so much in fact that it is the core of my system.
  4. There is no use for 24 different indicators. My system uses 2, one of which is stochastics. The key is to know when the market is trending, and when it is ranging. Since indicators are to be used only in certain situations, depending on market context, the previous statement is crucial.
  5. Indicators must be applied consistently, with the same settings, throughout all time frames. Shorter indicator settings/parameters are preferable since they provide an earlier signal (assuming you know how to use MTF).
  6. I agree with almost all of your points, and believe you are definitely on to something, and if I am being critical it is only because I'm trying to be helpful and I want to see the best application possible...

1\. MTF concepts: I really want a slow pace and expected that we will have a spiral move from upper bound to the core. I am waiting for the "Group By" view, once it is implemented we will be good to discuss and understand the whole thing.  
  
2\. It is actually not 24 technicals. Rather 3 sets of technicals. 1. Moving Avg, 2. ATR, 3. Decider group of technicals (RSI, CCI, High/Low, bulls/bears etc. - check the left hand side of ATR)

1\. Closing / set-off the earlier opened positions.  
2\. Pending orders  
3\. H5 spot opportunity  
4\. Binary pairs opportunity

Please follow the steps, 1,2,3,4 as simple as that!  
  
1\. Selecting Instruments and moving to any of the baskets such as Asia/UK/US. Gradually using the App you will find the usefulness.

M30, so there is no definite strength at the moment for the instruments. Now we will place pending orders on their R2, R3, S2, S3 levels. Only the Daily "Hot-List" we will select for that.

Google is close to its monthly support level. Weakness we can see in a strong buying market. With trend entry for buy will be around S3 level.

On the Day 6th we are left with only one open position with previous batch. We have different success ratio on the batch. We need to concentrate on increasing the equity now so we will be selecting higher winrate instruments for trading.

As per my broker still 30 mins left to Open US Stock Market, so we will begin scanning. Target is to take entry with only favourite instruments. For entry we will follow the strength of the instrument as well as fib levels.

Set up the Scanner, for US session I filled up two baskets 1) Asia basket - where I put my favourite forex instruments, 2) US basket - where I put my favourite stocks.  
  
I checked on these 2 baskets for scanning.

So, today also I will be trading based on pending orders on my favourite pairs, calculation I have already posted.  
  
My thread activity will be very less in next 7 days, my target is to roll-out the most awaited update on "Multi Time Frame Analysis of Instruments". The objectives of releasing this update will be as below:  
  
A. One View of all Time frames strength of 24 technicals or the 3-Sets of technicals (1. Trend, 2. Volatility, 3. Strength and Weakness).  
B. Complete elimination of MT4 charts reading.  
C. Preparing the future base of trading when you at office ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
D. This will be an addition with all present features intact.  
E. Specially for Binary and same effective for spots.  
F. Once it is released forward testing phase will be initiated.

_**Market Scanner v 1.03**_  
  
This update is all set to roll-out. The objectives of this release are as below,  
  
A. Removing OWA dependency, so it means we can skip the additional installation steps from now on and with Excel default feature we are good to run the Market Scanner App,  
  
B. Multi Time frame Analysis part will be easier now with this update, framework wise it is now better.

_**Market Scanner v 1.04**_  
  
This part is going to be the most exciting part of this entire development phase and first time we are going to see the Multi time frame analysis for the instruments.   
  
Due to my office related projects I will be travelling in next 3-4 weeks and will be developing the features at the same time, I want to release this as soon as possible but it might get a bit delayed as well, lets hope for the best.

_**Multi Time Frame Analysis : preparing the stage of looking at the market as "One View"**_  
  
* Trader A sees EURUSD trade as sell in H4.  
Trader B prefers trading in smaller time frame, he sees the opportunity of buying EURUSD before the Trader A sees the selling opportunity.  
  
* Trader A is waiting for a good entry in H4, he wants the price to retrace up a bit and atleast the price tests R1 resistance, so that he can go for "With Trend Entry" and can go with the best odd.  
  
Trader B closed his buy trade @ near the pivot level of price, and waits for selling opportunity doing counter.  
  
As a reader, which trading style you like?  
  
* Trader B is trusts on his skill of feeling the Market pulse correctly and can do counter trend confidently.  
  
Trader A is trusts on his patience of getting less risky and high rewarding entry.  
  
* Trader B trusts his skill and has very good win rate, he considers taking some risk for high reward, he starts taking trades on binary options and find it suits him best.

_**Multi Time Frame Analysis : preparing the stage of looking at the market as "One View" (...contd)**_  
  
* Trader A generally takes trades based on H4 and above and monitors support / resistance levels, supply / demand levels continuously. He starts building his position when price strikes the first level of S/R, he counts it as "1" and initiate the first position, similarly as price continues striking the S/R and count increases from 1 to 2 and so on Trader A continue incrementing the position size.  
  
eg. for 2nd strike on s/r he adds another position of x*0.20 , for 3rd strike he adds another position of x * 0.30  
  
He puts the stop on Monthly S/R + 10 pips, and Take profit on H1 pivot, M30 S/R points etc.  
  
* Trader B prefers quick entry and exit and takes trade based on M15, M30. He monitors S/R points on M5 to H1 and place TP and Stops likewise.  
  
Both are doing good using MTFA. Let us know if you find problem with their technique.

_**Multi Time Frame Analysis : preparing the stage of looking at the market as "One View" (...contd)**_  
  
MTFA can be applied for both "With-Trend" and "Counter-Trend" entry. Traders often get confused which time frames to select and how to look at. In my opinion you need to follow a simple calculation and should not confuse your mind.  
  
So if you are looking at M5 for entry then M5 is the lowest time frame you selected, to exit simply multiply it by 4, so M5 * 4 ~ the next higher Time frame you have is M30.  
  
Enter in the market with M5 signal and Exit from the market by reading M30 fib levels.  
  
Apply the same calculation on your preferable time frames.

Market Scanner Application will have MTFA feature in v 1.04, this time I will be making a complementary free version of this App. Objective is to have more users with zero investment so that they can join actively in the discussion of Multi Time Frame Analysis for trading both spot and binary.  
  
This approach might need closing this thread and moving to a discussion forum. I will let all know once I finish the development.  
  
Thanks.

Version 1.04 is all set to rollout this week, most probably by this sat-sun days. It seems a slower one than the previous but we will be trading on higher timeframes and minimum of M30 and will be able to see all timeframes starting M5 to Monthly at once.

Well, this version is promising to clear all doubts about MTFA. I am happy to see the results and there is simply no other tool available for free to give such nice analysis.  
  
Just want to add this is not for the people who want signals and free trades, this is only for the traders who has a sound mindset for analysis.

With MTFA approach we will have an advantage of catching big trends. Here I took EURUSD, EURGBP and GBPUSD , we can see Weakness or trend reversal signs in E/U very easily (look at the MA series), it was a buy but losing buy interest as time progresses. Sellers got good entries for sell around 1.39 levels (read the fib levels).

_**Important Announcement**_  
  
I opened this thread with two objectives in my mind.  
  
One, introducing Market Scanner Application as a tool to the traders to help them further analysing the trades they take, understand the differences between doing spot and doing binary and how the instrument strengths of different time frames can help specially in binary.  
  
Objective two was to create a discussion platform by distributing the Application to users and posting results and trading approaches here so that I can fine tune the application further.  
  
The entire project duration is so far less then 3 months and I am doing it as my part time activity, on an average merely 2 hours per day. Infrastructure wise the application support will never be a 24 * 5 or 24 / 7 because it is a personal project.  
  
It is not my primary intention of selling this App, this type of App we call "Shareware" where only a limited number of people who have been seeing this project from the very beginning and willing to see the outcome and risk a little investment for a future tool and further engage as a community of discussing the method, approach, fine tuning of the technical etc.  
  
Now, if I further summarise my efforts till now, I see 3 groups of people presently subscribed on this App.  
  
First Group has done the **A -** which is invested in the future tool and patiently waiting for the result. Not much confident till now using and utilizing the APP.  
Second Group has done the **B -** which is they have taken a trial run and already contributed some very useful insights to this App.  
Third Group is alarming to me **C** \- because they have not understand my efforts till now and assumed that this is a signal software, they have taken a trial run and not able to make any use of the App.  
  
Apart from that now we have a fourth group of users **D -** who do not want to go for any trial run however interested in **"Trial"** so I personally want to take a chance on this user group and want to see how they can bring value to the thread in terms of discussion. A trader is as good as he/she able to explain in forms of writing or speaking, so if you are still struggling with taking good trades then try writing your trade ideas that will help to open your minds and your mind will be more analytical of resisting you from taking bad trades and picking up the good ones.  
  
So further in summation, we now have a better tool, however, need a better platform to discuss on method of using the App, so I am proposing to moving to a discussion forum where we will be using this App for free (* for a limited time like one month or so) and lets figure it out if it is helping us or not. Having said that, I hope you also understand participation is going to be important here, so expecting you to add value and not spend your whole day silently wondering about what, why. For users of MTFA can form a skype group as well and discuss the trading ideas that will also be very helpful however, due to my nature of work I might join sometime but I will not be available for all the time.  
  
  
I will shortly send out the App to the present users, will open a new thread and share the link and shortly will be closing this thread.  
  
Thank you.
