Hi dimdel,  
  
Looks interesting.  
  
I will test this out in about a week or 2, need to get my system up and running.   
  
Thanks for sharing.  
  
Anyone try to automate this, make dashboard for all currencies, or setup some type of arrows.  
  
Thanks, will be following. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Dimdel,  
  
Thanks for sharing your idea.   
CHF-JPY hit the target TP yesterday. I know you don't trade that one, but just FYI. So far, all the other closed trades I placed with your system were profitable.

I understand that your use MTF HA to show your monthly HA.  
  
For your daily candles, are those HA as well? Did you change the settings? Do you have a template by chance? Thanks.

HI LUCA  
  
how exit ? you mean where exit  
ok well  
i think that less RR from 1/1 is no sense to trade  
so i use TP the same pips with SL  
or you can use fibo

Hi Dimdel , very interesting method, thanks for sharing.  
I've got some questions, as i saw in your screen shots, your sl and tp is different from the first page as you explained and some of your closed have been closed manually and also some of them hasn't got any sl and tp . may i know your reason for them?   
and also may i know the percentage indicator which you use for tp and sl indication?  
thanks in advance and more green pips to you.

Hi Dimdel,

Just wondering trade explorer says it has a 50% success rate. Is that accurate ? I don't know how reliable trade explorer is.I wanted to know what u have found so far in terms of %win

Hi, i am following your system and i have a question about the time-decision. When do you open orders ? For example USDCAD now is different from your screenshoot (HA is red).  
  
thanks in advance.

I take this also as Filter for Trend.

Hi Dimdel,  
Can this strategy apply to opening of Monday candle? Because usually there will be some of the pairings will open with a "gap" on Monday after market closing at weekend. 

I will never lose, either I win or I learn.

if you have signal at friday night 23,30 then you can put order  
the opposite gap is part of the game  
but the point is how much % profit we can make a week  
loses will be in any system  
thanks

Hi Dimdel,  
I backtested your system last week and I think it is a very profitable system. Thanks for sharing your system to everyone right here! I will try this system out on this week! 

I will never lose, either I win or I learn.

Hello dimdel  
  
I have been following both your methods from the start; in your experience so far, which way are you more inclined: green/red on 6 pairs or best close on 24 pairs?  
As for myself, I am more inclined towards green/red, but of course you have carried out a much more detailed test of both strategies and would know better than me 

Regards

To all the peeps who are trying out this method,  
Do you always make the trade to break-even to protect you from the loss? From what I observed from the history, it might goes against your direction before it hits TP. How you all see this? Correct me if I'm wrong! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f617.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f3b6.png?v=15.1)

I never move my SL to BE because i trigger my trade and look at my chart after 24 hours. Remember, 10 minutes with charts and do what You have to do.

hi kelvin  
there is no system with 100% profit to all orders  
if you lose a few orders is part of the game  
i dont use BE  
price will go to SL or TP  
i want RR 1/1, so if the win>lose then we are winners

Hi, I have made EA base on this one but using HA_Smooth instead. Open 2 orders each currency. 6 parameters to display index1, index2, index3 , index4, high and low. Index is to detemine the candle is red or white, if white then index1<index2 , index3<index4. Index1,2 is monthly and 3,4 is daily  
Stop loss if buy then low take profit = low + 50 pips and reverse with sell. Here some result I made last night show some promising. Test it and see what you think ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
Put heiken_aishi to indicator folder if you not have it yet. EA to expert folder.

Not yet dimdel, still haven't touch that yet. Also the take profit somehow still need to be fix, stop loss is okay at high and condition 50 pips. Still I'm not get quite the close > open thing. Hope you explain in detail that.

Dimdel,  
  
do you open new trades on pairs that have a running trade? Not sure about the rules in this case.

Dimdel, thanks for sharing this amazing strategy. I did some back tests and it seems very profitable.  
  
Today I put orders following this strategy on AUD CHF, AUD JPY, CAD CHF, CAD JPY, EUR AUD, EUR CAD, EUR GBP, EUR NZD, GBP AUD, GBP NZD, NZD CHF, NZD JPY, USD CAD and USD JPY.  
  
Let's see what will happen, hehehehe...

I coded a multi currency EA for a customer based on this strategy and so far it's looking quite good in the tests I've done.  
  
Best of luck

I'm running my EA on a fresh account from start and will update each evening how the trades have done, only thing I'm scaling into the trades rather than just entering  
and no one stop and take profit fits all.  
  
Stop and Take is calculated on the ADR for each pair.

I assume that's a back test?  
  
The EA has closed 2 trades in profit, GBPNZD, entry was: 2.3828 and EURNZD, entry was: 1.74003, both were long trades, I have a AUDCAD rolling still  
entry was: 0.9456 and that was a short trade.

Hi dimpel,  
  
When I refer to a trade, I always refer to a LONG trade.  
  
I don't back test, back testing is a nonsense and means nothing.  
No I'm not trying to sell my EA, I'm just giving the results of your strategy and they are looking quite good using my scaling in method.  
I've modified the entry slightly to try confirm a turning point back into the MN1, D1 trend.  
I've added a setting to confirm the pullback is more than a dynamically calculated number of pips based on the ADR for each pair and another   
setting to confirm the close of the current bar is higher than the open by a dynamically calculated number of pips based on the ADR.  
  
Asw

Hi,  
  
Why did you use less lots for those negative trades? What made you do that?  
  
Can you tell me how to read the Japanese candle? How can you find high low in those handles?  
  
  
Some of the candle is drawn with thick lines , other parts with thin line... What does that mean?

Hi Dimdel  
first of all thanks for sharing this strategy  
I believe this is not an EA  
As i 'm not fluent in english and newbie, could you or any body elaborate the rule to buy /sell because I can''t follow it (when to buy/sell, tp& sl)  
  
Thanks before

example to avoid  
  
generally i prefer trade 7-10 ( my time) and if iwin then stop, or if i lose then i try again at 15-18  
  
ok   
A = 7-10 win  
B = no trade area ( but i trade)  
C = no need to trade becausee 7-10 was win, but i trade  
D = dont trade before or after the news , but i trade  
  
  
so   
\-- i write all these to see with which way can lose , if you dont know it ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
\-- stick to the your rules

ENTRY at daily candle close  
SL the H/L of this candle  
TP = same pips with SL  
  
SHORT   
RED CANDLE DAILY AND MONTHLY  
CLOSE > OPEN  
SL= H  
  
LONG  
GREEN CANDLE DAILY AND MONTHLY  
CLOSE < OPEN  
SL=L  
  
IS IT CORRECT?

my main strategy is green red / daily  
but usally i look the chart 3-4 times a day  
so if i have time and i have signal , then i put orders  
so i cant say if is profitable because must trade it all time  
my result is positive, but maybe is just luck  
perhaps some friends help to find out if worth

Hi Dimdel....i have a question for this 'fuga' system:  
  
We look for price to make **a new high or low,** and based on the new printed high/low **we measure with fibo the distance between breakout level and the new high/low** , and we put pending order at 100 level? with SL@ Zero level and TP @ 200 level?  
  
In your last picture you had a short (pending) because we had a new high printed, right?

Aren't we trying to short on a possible support this way ?

Yes, indeed, but if we take into consideration 'a range market structure' - when a new high is made market will seek liquidity in to the other way of the range....that could work, as i saw that on M1 chart, Sl and TP will not be more than 20-25 pips.

hi fxentropy  
  
i look for new high/low  
if the distance is 18 pips min then i put short/long pending  
this order is valid if the price break the entry directly without any zigzag angles

One more thing, do you look for higher timeframe trend or ou just trade the setup as it come? up and down, without bias?

OK guys, I am here, answering the call.  
Unfortunately, I am lost in the system rules. 

  1. Signal Long/Short
  2. Entry Buy/Sell
  3. SL/TP

The beach here is awful, so I am just going home ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Hey maestro: here are the rules (maybe dimdel can confirm if all OK with these)  
  
Regardless of timeframe (although we trade M1), let's say that market make a new LOW.  
  
Then we put Fibo from the new created low to last low that zigzag created , and thats how we find our entry point + 5 pips. ENTRY +5 pips room will save a lot of fake signals actually... (zigzag set is 21 5 3 )  
  
Take profit is minimum 1:1 with risk....but from my observations can go as high as Risk Reward 1:5 easy!!  
  
Dimdel however created another rule, saying that if the market do too much zigzags before reach the entry point then the entry would not be valid anymore. I guess we can filter that as in time....if a order is not filled in 30 mins we delete it.  
  
In below examples we have a SL 15 pips with a doable TP of 50 pips (even 80 pips)

Adding nothing new here, just a reminder of a simple and working method when followed with consistency and discipline.  
  
Long only: MA1>MA2>MA3 | close when price closes above MA1  
Short only: MA1<MA2<MA3 | close when price closes below MA1  
In both cases the trader scales-in when a signal candle appears, closes all as mentioned above.  
MA's choice is upon trader's discretion, e.g. MA1 can be 10EMA, MA2 can be 20SMA, MA3 can be 200SMA (classic)  
  
9 entries below, 7 of them could be profitable. NOTE: 1 minute chart attached. At least once a day there is a trend like this in at least on pair of the, let's say, 3 that are being watched. That is enough.

Hi dimdel,  
  
that's the reason for the note added in the post.  
The timeframe is so low that 20-25 pips trends happen everyday, often more than once. Especially in high volatility pairs. So if someone chooses 2-3 of such pairs it is easy to make 10-15 pips a day. These pips are enough to be profitable.  
  
Simple strategies are the best as they can be applied consistently.  
The more complicated a strategy is the more often fails to be applied consistently.  
Consistency is the other key (patience is the first one)

hi liunliun  
  
well  
your chart is right  
the zig zag must have diff parametres for each timeframe  
the zig zag sometimes repaint, but its ok  
  
the green red is another system  
this is the "fuga"  
  
  
but who cares about the names?  
all we want a good system no a good name ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

the system is the 30% of the good trader  
  
anyway dont have problems with names etc  
dont expect the best system  
stay in one system  
if you have a system with 90% loses and 10% win, then this is good system at the end  
just trade opposite

Thank you for sharing your system.

Is there a way to use this strategy on the cell phone? How to identify without ziz zag? or is there some indicator that helps to identify high and low? replacing the zigzag that does not have in the mt4 application

If I understand properly, to define a long set up price must be lower than last lower fractal.  
  
If Low[1]>Low[2] we have a potential stop in the bear wave, so we place a buy stop order @ lower fractal (100 level), stop @ the bottom of the bear wave, and 1:1 risk reward.  
  
The opposite to go short.  
  
Correct?

Thanks Dimdel, Trade that got entered yesterday on EURAUD 4 hr chart. I know the TG level is not 1:1 though. This is a mix up of different indicators from other strategies I am trying so please disregard them. I just added the ZZ to the chart.  
  
Is it correct as there are multiple candles not touching the entry level before actually entering the position?  
Thanks

Dimdel, Are your setting for each TF different or do you use the posted figures 21, 5, 3 for all of them? Asking as I looked at the GBPUSD winning trade from 2 oct 1 hr and don't see the entry. I do like the strategy...so simple and clean...  
Thanks

Sure,  
Reviewed the thead,  
Saw that you are using 3l2l2 setting for ZigZag for DAX,so:  
You are applying same setting for all forex pairs for all time frames?  
And generally your preferred TF is H1?

Btw, did you move your SL to BE or somewhere when the profit reach certain pips?

Hi Masterlee  
  
Would you mind making an indicator with alert when conditions are met, also allow to be able to change the zig zag settings.

Hi Liunliun  
  
Would you be so kind to make a indicator instead of a EA. If possible add alert when conditions are met and also give the ability to change the Zig Zag settings.

I seem the best trades are when  
  
(PREVIOUS FRACTAL LOW - STOP) < (FRACTAL HIGH - PREVIOUS FRACTAL LOW) for long tardes, where   
  
PREVIOUS FRACTAL LOW = entry price  
FRACTAL HIGH = target price  
  
(STOP - PREVIOUS FRACTAL HIGH) < (PREVIOUS FRACTAL HIGH - FRACTAL LOW) for short tardes, where   
  

PREVIOUS FRACTAL HIGH = entry price

FRACTAL LOW = target price

  
FRACTALS calculated with ZIG ZAG indicator

Hello Dimdel, I am reviewing your system carefully. As with most good systems, it is not complicated. I have time for H4 and D1 so this ideal for me.   
  
I am doing my due diligence and find this to be a net winner for sure. Looking forward to placing some trades next week.  
  
Of course, I am also checking over possible filters.  
  
Your continued use of red/green tells us a lot after so much time.   
  
Thanks for sharing. I'll try to put up some charts next week.

hi  
-i think nude chart is better  
many filters less signals  
but if work for you its ok  
-the only safe way is the MM x 2 ( money and mind managment)  
example  
\- 2 persons win 5% each a month with 3% risk , ( i think its ok)  
the 1st have 100.000$ and the second 500$, i think the second after 1 month will risk 40% and this is the end......   
that is the game

Thank yo for the the great thread. All the people are looking only for great entry. Bit great exit is more than 50% of success. I think it is 90% )  
But please tell me how to use zigzag for closing since it repaint? May be I'm missing something?  
I prefer to close (or set sl in BE) on reverse candle (when bear candle high is highest today, and bull low lowest) or/and on stoch oversold/overbought (can be rsi or whatever).

hi  
yes ,zigzag repaint  
but  
repaint only the curent leg  
no repaint the angle  
so no problem to this strategy  
also you can use trsl to 161 fibo , its more safe

Dear Sir!

I'm Trang.

Hi dimdel,   
Interesting ingenious trading approach and fantastic to see your longevity and persistence ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1).  
Just starting to try it out. Wonder if say a 200 ema might provide a filter with a return to the mean type approach? Or whether it is better to just trade it as you have successfully presented it without any additional indicators/filters and as such biases.  
Cheers ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

I do agree with your preference for naked chart. Best to play every trade the same

Well done. dimdel also allows for price to move through the 100.0 level by 5 pips to try to reduce false signals / breakouts.

Here are the results of yesterday's M1 entries. So good strategy. Do you usually trade the m30 time frame?

Hi dimdel ,   
  
Thank you for sharing your system.   
your thread is very light , simple , straight forward and elegant.   
I read it all in one session.   
hope to try your ideas next week.   
seems to be ok , I will scan all the market watch ( automatically ) , to check all possible entries and check percentage of winning positions. I will try different TimeFrames to find the best one , I prefere smaller to have more positions, lets see how thing go.   
  
thanx again

Dear Dimdel   
  
  
This picture is from your post 1.   
  
just to make sure I got it right, do you mean that this is valid entry as we have one candle does not cross the entry level?

hi Dimdel ,   
  
what do you want to say here ??  
if we have high then HH we expect to go short next , here why you are taking long position while we don't have LL after Low ?

Hi Dimdel ,   
  
in this picture , I am confused for two things , level 0 -- 100 should be drawn between the two highs , or two lows , so I adjust them on the left setup for buy positon , is my understanding correct ,   
second thing the entry level for buy position should be the higher low , you are saying this is the entry level for both positions? please clarify if my understanding is wrong   
  
Regards, #

Hi Dimdel ,   
  
sorry for too many questions but I need to understand your strategy 100%.   
in this picture , do you mean we can apply the strategy between any two highs provided is the new High is higher than previous high and they should not be immediately following each other?  
in the picture I see you apply it between 1 and 2 in the picture please confirm  
  
regards,

This is clear , but I understand from the post 156 and next and from post 1 , you are trading against the trend.   
  
to trade with the zigzag trend , this is new I discovered late or you updated/improved your strategy recently
