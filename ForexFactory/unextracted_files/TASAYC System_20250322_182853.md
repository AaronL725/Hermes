TASAYC  
Trade as simple as you can   
  
This simple & effective TASAYC-System appropriates only the Pivotals and the CCI-Indicator and some Trends-Lines sometimes and could be used in Trending- as in Ranging Markets. You could learn how to incorporate these technical indicators into your analysis to improve your trading decisions. You can put more things into it if you like (Example #[**1715**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5377582#post5377582)). The Multiple-Time-Frame-Analyse keeps you out of bad trades as well as keeps you from over trading.  
  
Be aware  
Despite the nonexistence of the magic formula there are certainly high probability ways of trading the forex market. At FF the most comments are focused on the Method part, but you need to combine Method with both Money and Mind in order to attain success in the trading business.  
  
This thread hasn't the intention to get hold of the Holy Grail, whether it truly exists or not. A lot of traders seek the perfect formula that is capable of predicting with 100% accuracy the future price movements. Want to know where it lies? It only exists in the creative part of the mind - together with fairies and gnomes.  
  
I believe that an important factor of trading success lies in the matching of Method with the trader's own personality and trading style.  
  
"TASAYC" could be also used with Strategies like "Breakout Fading" or "Breakout Trading" or "Decreased Volatility Breakout" or in trends with steep gradients depending on your own risk appetite and could put in in other trading styles or in confirming trend direction and trend strength with oscillators (e.g. Stochastic, MACD). You can let it simple or could use it in a more complex way.

Trading rules may be subject to interpretation. It is your responsibility as a trader to decide what information to use and what to disregard and you do so at your own risk. Use the ideas and/or modify them to suit your trading style. I recommend testing your trading system on demo account before investing real money.  
  
Planned risk levels may be increased dramatically under extreme market conditions.   
  
I will give examples here and there of my trading style when I have the time and the love to do it.

EURUSD, M5, 2011 November 10  
EURUSD, M1, 2011 November 10  
  
Trade Example - Scalping:  
Here I am in at M5 and go out at M1 a little moment later concernin the trading after the London Close.  
Profit: 6 Pips (1.35917 - 1.35981)  
  
The most of time I trade the Tops & Bottoms with the CCI-Indicator in conjunction with the Pivotal Points.   
In this trading example there wasn't any Pivotal but ist's also an evening market after London Close (~20h45 GMT+1).

EURUSD, M30, 2011 November 10  
EURUSD, M1, 2011 November 10  
  
Trade Example - Scalping  
Here you could see a trendline at M30. Box "A" described a CCI-Bottom-Area and the green Boxes "C" and "D" a Top-Level-Area of the CCI(14)-Indicator. You could also recognize a "B"/"C"-Divergence where the market price went down afterwards. The CCI didn't show a clear picture at M30 Box "D". It could go further more down or up.   
  
An Entry was made by reason of the M30-Trendline where the price has touched the red ascending resistance line. The Exit was selected at M1 due to the fact of the closed London Market. I wouldn't stay in this trade any longer.

Using the CCI-Indicator has for me more a dynamical aspect. At first I switch through the timeframes (M1, M5, M15, M30, H1, H4, Daily, Weekly, Monthly) and look after some excellent CCI Pictures. If I have find some few I make up my mind if I want to go in the market (or out of the market). Trading is not to follow any rules in a strict way, it's often to need your experience & tolerance about the fluctuations of the price market which you have consider in your Money Management.  
I wish you good Luck!

It is not recommended to trade with 0.5 Lot Sizes at a 90.-$ Account. This could be done more at experienced-trader-level if you like to trade with higher risc here and there. If you do so be aware > accounts could be pulverized!

Trade Example  
Watching different timeframes could give you good ideas and orientation. The market seems in a range at M15, M30 and it seems good time for M1/M5 Trading (maybe with Stop Losses ~5 Pips above or below the Range Box).  
M5 Box "A" signalizing an excellent Short condition for going down. The market price is upside. Box "B" could given also an entry chance, because if you compare the M30 candles together you will become aware that the market price is located above two-thirds length of the candle.

When you have done your short term analyse at the next higher timeframes (#[**11**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5123249#post5123249)) you could set your entries and exits at M1-Level (or M5), e.g. when scalping.  
When the market seems still and prices are following a range decribed above (#[**11**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5123249#post5123249)) a M1 Divergence could give one powerful argument for the market entry (so also for the exits). I don't attach value at M1-Level-Divergences usually.

****Channel Breakouts With The CCI****  
Posted: Mar 5, 2008   
  
Often in life, the right action is the hardest to take. The same dynamic occurs in trading. For most traders it is extremely difficult to buy tops and sell bottoms because from a very early age we are conditioned to look for value and buy "cheap" while selling "dear". This is why although most traders proclaim their love for trading with the trend, in reality, the majority love to pick [tops](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/atop.asp) or [bottoms](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bottom.asp). While these types of "turn" trades can be very profitable, turn trading can sometimes seem like a Sisyphean task as price trends relentlessly in one direction, constantly stopping out the bottom and top pickers.   
  
Most traders are reluctant to buy [breakouts](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/breakout.asp) for fear of being the last one to the party before prices reverse with a vengeance. So, how can they learn to trade breakouts confidently and successfully? The "do the right thing" setup is designed to deal with just such a predicament. It tells the trader to buy or sell when most ingrained lessons are against doing so. Furthermore, it puts the trader on the right side of the trend at the times when many other traders are trying to fade the price action. Read on as we cover this strategy and show you some examples of how it can be used.   
  
**Do the Right Thing - Trade Breakouts  
**In the "do the right thing" strategy, the capitulation of top and bottom pickers in the face of a massive buildup of [momentum](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/momentum.asp) forces a covering of positions, allowing you to exit profitably within a very short period of time after putting on a trade.  
  
"Do the right thing" employs a rarely used indicator in FX called the [commodity channel index](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commoditychannelindex.asp) (CCI), which was invented by Donald Lambert in 1980 and was originally designed to solve engineering problems regarding signals. The primary focus of CCI is to measure the deviation of the price of the currency pair from its statistical average. As such, CCI is an extremely good and sensitive measure of momentum and helps us to optimize only the highest probability entries for our setup. (For background reading, see _[Timing Trades With The Commodity Channel Index](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/05/041805.asp)_.)  
  
Without resorting to the mathematics of the indicator, please note that CCI is an unbound oscillator with a reading of +100 typically considered to be overbought and any reading of -100 is considered oversold. For our purposes, however, we will use these levels as our trigger points as we put a twist on the traditional interpretation of CCI. We actually look to buy if the currency pair makes a new high above 100 and sell if the currency pair makes a new low below -100. In "do the right thing" we are looking for new peaks or spikes in momentum that are likely to carry the currency pair higher or lower. The thesis behind this setup is that much like a body in motion will remain so until it's slowed by counterforces, new highs or lows in CCI will propel the currency farther in the direction of the move before new prices finally put a halt to the advance or the decline.  
  
**Rules for the Long Trade**

  1. On the daily or the hourly charts, place the CCI indicator with standard input of 20.
  2. Note the very last time the CCI registered a reading of greater than +100 before dropping back below the +100 zone.
  3. Take a measure of the peak CCI reading and record it.
  4. If CCI once again trades above the +100 and if its value exceeds the prior peak reading, go long at market at the close of the candle.
  5. Measure the low of the candle and use it as your stop.
  6. If the position moves in your favor by the amount of your original stop, sell half and move the stop to breakeven.
  7. Take profit on the rest of the trade when the position moves to two times your stop.

**Rules for the Short Trade**

  1. On the daily or the hourly charts, place the CCI indicator with standard input of 20.
  2. Note the very last time the CCI registered a reading of less than -100 before poking above the -100 zone.
  3. Take a measure of the peak CCI reading and record it.
  4. If CCI once again trades below the -100 and if its value exceeds the prior low reading, go short at market at the close of the candle.
  5. Measure the high of the candle and use it as your stop.
  6. If the position moves in your favor by the amount of your original stop, sell half and move the stop on the remainder of the position to breakeven.
  7. Take profit on the rest of the trade when position moves to two times your stop.

**CCI Setup On Longer Time Frames  
**In the daily chart of the EUR/USD pair (Figure 1) we see that the former peak high above the CCI +100 level was recorded on September 5, 2005, when it reached a reading of 130. Not until more than three months later on December 13, 2005, did the CCI produce a value that would exceed this number.   
  
Throughout this time, we can see that EUR/USD was in a severe decline with many false breakouts to the upside that fizzled as soon as they appeared on the chart. On December 13, 2005, however, CCI hit 162.61 and we immediately went long on the close at 1.1945 using the low of the candle at 1.1906 as our stop. Our first target was 100% of our risk, or approximately 40 points. We exited half the position at 1.1985 and the second half of the position at two times our risk at 1.2035. Our total [reward-to-risk ratio](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskrewardratio.asp) on this trade was 1.5:1, which means that if we are only 50% accurate, the setup would still have positive expectancy. Note also that we were able to capture our gains in less than 24 hours as the momentum of the move carried our position to profit very quickly.

For traders who do not like to wait nearly a quarter of a year between setups, the hourly chart offers far more opportunities for the "do the right thing" setup. It is still infrequent, which is one of the reasons that makes this setup so powerful (the common wisdom in trading is "the rarer the trade, the better the trade"). Nevertheless, it occurs on the hourly charts far more often than on the dailies.  
  
In Figure 2, we look at the hourly chart of the EUR/USD between March 24 and March 28 of 2006. At 1pm on March 24, the EUR/USD reaches a CCI peak of 142.96. Several days later at 4am on March 28, the CCI reading reaches a new high of 184.72. We go long at market on the close of the candle at 1.2063. The low of the candle is 1.2027 and we set our stop there.   
  
The pair consolidates for several hours and then makes a burst to our first target of 1.2103 at 9am on March 28. We move the stop to breakeven to protect our profits and are stopped out a few hours later, banking 40 pips of profit. As the saying goes, half a loaf is better than none, and it is amazing how they can add up to a whole bakery full of profits if we simply take what the market gives us.

Figure 2: Do the Right Thing CCI Trade, EUR/USD Source: FXtrekIntellichart   
  
**CCI Setup On Shorter Time Frames  
**Figure 3 shows a short in the USD/CHF. This example is the opposite of the approach shown above. On October 11, 2004, USD/CHF makes a CCI low of -131.05. A few days later, on October 14, the CCI prints at -133.68. We enter short at market on the close of the [candle](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/candlestick.asp) at 1.2445. Our stop is the high of that candle at 1.2545. Our first exit is hit just two days later at 1.2345. We stay in the trade with the rest of the position and move the stop to breakeven. Our second target is hit on October 19 - no more than five days after we've entered the trade.  
  
The total profit on the trade? 300 points. Our total risk was only 200 points, and we never even experienced any serious drawdown as the momentum pulled prices farther down. The key is high probability, and that is exactly what the "do the right thing" setup provides.

Figure 3: Do the Right Thing CCI Trade, USD/CHF Source: FXtrekIntellichart   
  
Figure 4 shows another example of a short-term trade, this time to the downside in the EUR/JPY. At 9pm on March 21, 2006, EUR/JPY recorded a reading of -115.19 before recovering above the -100 CCI zone. The "do the right thing" setup triggered almost perfectly five days later, at 8pm on March 26. The CCI value reached a low of -133.68 and we went short on the close of the candle. This was a very large candle on the hourly charts, and we had to risk 74 points as our entry was 140.79 and our stop was at 141.51.   
  
Many traders would have been afraid to enter short at that time, thinking that most of the selling had been done, but we had faith in our strategy and followed the setup. Prices then consolidated a bit and trended lower until 1pm on March 27. Less than 24 hours later we were able to hit our first target, which was a very substantial 74 points. Again we moved our stop to breakeven. The pair proceeded to bottom out and rally, taking us out at breakeven. Although we did not achieve our second target overall, it was a good trade as we banked 74 points without ever really being in a significant drawdown.

**When "Do the Right Thing" Does You Wrong**  
Figure 5 shows how this setup can go wrong and why it is critical to always use stops. The "do the right thing" setup relies on momentum to generate profits. When the momentum fails to materialize, it signals that a turn may be in the making. Here is how it played out on the hourly charts in AUD/USD. We note that CCI makes a near-term peak at 132.58 at 10pm on May 2, 2006. A few days later at 11am on May 4, CCI reaches 149.44 prompting a long entry at .7721. The stop is placed at .7709 and is taken out the very same hour. Notice that instead of rallying higher, the pair reversed rapidly. Furthermore, as the downside move gained speed, prices reached a low of .7675. A trader who did not take the 12-point stop as prescribed by the setup would have learned a very expensive lesson indeed as his losses could have been magnified by a factor of three. Therefore, the key idea to remember with our "do the right thing" setup is - "I am right or I am out!"

**Conclusion  
**"Do the right thing" allows traders to trade breakouts confidently and successfully. CCI can put you on the right side of a trade when many others are trying to fade the price action. However, this setup only works if you apply it along with disciplined stops to protect you from major losses if the expected momentum fails to materialize.

**Commodity Channel Index (CCI)**  
  
**Commodity Channel Index (CCI)** is a hugely popular indicator among traders. Although novice traders tend to pay little attention to CCI in the beginning of their lerning curve, later they return to discover amazing potential and beautiful simplicity of the CCI indicator.  
  
There is a variety of CCI indicators, just by looking at the screenshot below with various CCI versions, it becomes understandable - there is huge package of trading methods behind each simple and custom CCI indicator.

****Fundamentals of trading with CCI indicator****  
  
Developed by Donald Lambert, original CCI consists of a single line which oscillates between +/-200.  
CCI indicator was created to identify bullish and bearish market cycles as well as to define market turning points, market strongest and weakest periods.  
Designed for commodities, CCI has quickly found its application in other markets including Forex. The author advises to use CCI for entries and exits once CCI reaches +/-100. It goes as follows:  
When CCI moves above +100, there is a strong uptrend confirmed, therefore traders should open a Buy position. The trade is held as long as CCI trades above +100. Exits will be made when CCI goes back below +100. Opposite true for downtrends and readings below -100. Since 1980 when CCI indicator was first introduces, traders have found lots of ways to interpret CCI and expand trading rules. all those methods and views will be cover here.

**CCI and its Zero line**  
  
An aggressive way to enter the market is to react to CCI's line crossing its zero level.  
When CCI moves above Zero, traders would Buy the currency expecting a newly changed trend to hold. Vice versa, when CCI falls below zero, traders would Sell looking to benefit from early signals of an emerging downtrend.   
  
[http://forex-indicators.net/files/in...rs/ccizero.png](http://forex-indicators.net/files/indicators/ccizero.png)  
  
Simple rule:  
Above zero - Buyers' territory,  
below zero - Sellers' territory;   
unless, we have reached an oversold/oversold zone.

**CCI overbought & oversold zones**  
  
[http://forex-indicators.net/files/in...s/ccizones.png](http://forex-indicators.net/files/indicators/ccizones.png)  
  
**With CCI we can separate indicator readings to 3 zones:**  
  
1\. Already known, a zone above Zero (bullish) and a Zone below zero (bearish).  
Trading rules: when price crosses zero line, Buy/Sell depending on the direction of a crossover.  
  
2\. An overbought zone - CCI reading above +100, an oversold zone - CCI reading below -100  
Once price moves higher above +100, a strong uptrend has been established. Hold on to a Long position, but prepare to exit as soon as beautiful tall candlesticks yield place to smaller reversal candles with long shadows and small bodies. 3. An extremely overbought zone - CCI reading above +200, and an extremely oversold zone - CCI reading below -200.  
  
Take profit & close trades. Prepare for a price reversal.

**Bonus: CCI trading walkthrough**  
  
With what we know so far, we can already read and trade with CCI indicator.  
Let's walk through the numbers on the screenshot below:  
  
[http://forex-indicators.net/files/in...rs/cciwalk.png](http://forex-indicators.net/files/indicators/cciwalk.png)  
  
1 - CCI is in an overbought zone. The moment it entered there, we could have placed a Buy order, since we know that a strong uptrend has been established.  
  
2 - CCI rises to an extremely oversold level, this is where we know that the reversal is near, so the measures are to tighten our stop loss and either exit as we spot a reversal pin bar candlestick or wait till CCI exits below 200.  
  
3 - The moment CCI exits +200 zone we should close all remaining Long trades and look to Sell. With CCI exiting from an extremely overbought zone is a perfect opportunity to initiate our first Short trade.  
  
At the same time, should we never witness CCI above 200, we'll be still holding our Buy position open, because CCI continues to trade inside an overbought zone.  
(So, the difference is whether there was a rise above 200 or not. If we erase #2 event from the chart, we're trading in an overbought zone and continue to hold out Long position).   
  
4 - As price exits from an overbought zone, we close all Long positions and can immediately open Short positions / add to existing Short trades opened at point 3.  
  
5 - CCI crosses its Zero line and now is on Seller's territory. We can open yet another Short trade.  
  
6 - Price enters an oversold zone (below -100), which tells us that a downtrend is already running strong. We can add up to a Short trade and hold till we find that CCI rises back above -100.

**CCI ("Commodity Channel Index")** Developed by Donald Lambert, the Commodity Channel Index (CCI) is an indicator designed to identify cyclical turns in currencies or commodities. There are 4 steps involved in the calculation of the CCI:

  1. Calculate today's **Typical Price (TP)** = (H+L+C)/3 where H = high; L = low, and C = close.
  2. Calculate today's 20-day **Simple Moving Average of the Typical Price (SMATP)**.
  3. Calculate today's **Mean Deviation**. First, calculate the absolute value of the difference between today's SMATP and the typical price for each of the past 20 days. Add all of these absolute values together and divide by 20 to find the Mean Deviation.
  4. The final step is to apply the Typical Price (TP), the Simple Moving Average of the Typical Price (SMATP), the Mean Deviation and a Constant (.015) to the following formula:  
  
<http://forex-markets.com/images/cci_formula.gif>

For scaling purposes, Lambert set the constant at .015 to ensure that approximately 70 to 80 percent of CCI values would fall between -100 and +100. The CCI fluctuates above and below zero. The percentage of CCI values that fall between +100 and -100 will depend on the number of periods used. A shorter CCI will be more volatile with a smaller percentage of values between +100 and -100. Conversely, the more periods used to calculate the CCI, the higher the percentage of values between +100 and -100.  
Lambert's trading guidelines for the CCI focused on movements above +100 and below -100 to generate buy and sell signals. Because about 70 to 80 percent of the CCI values are between +100 and -100, a buy or sell signal will be in force only 20 to 30 percent of the time. When the CCI moves above +100, a currency is considered to be entering into a strong uptrend and a buy signal is given. The position should be closed when the CCI moves back below +100. When the CCI moves below -100, the security is considered to be in a strong downtrend and a sell signal is given. The position should be closed when the CCI moves back above -100.  
Since Lambert's original guidelines, traders have also found the CCI valuable for identifying reversals. The CCI is a versatile indicator capable of producing a wide array of buy and sell signals.

  1. CCI can be used to identify overbought and oversold levels. A currency would be deemed oversold when the CCI dips below -100 and overbought when it exceeds +100. From oversold levels, a buy signal might be given when the CCI moves back above -100. From overbought levels, a sell signal might be given when the CCI moved back below +100.
  2. As with most oscillators, divergences can also be applied to increase the robustness of signals. A positive divergence below -100 would increase the robustness of a signal based on a move back above -100. A negative divergence above +100 would increase the robustness of a signal based on a move back below +100.
  3. Trendline breaks can be used to generate signals. Trendlines can be drawn connecting the peaks and troughs. From oversold levels, an advance above -100 and trendline breakout could be considered bullish. From overbought levels, a decline below +100 and a trendline break could be considered bearish. Rex Takasugi has used this type of system to trade the Russell 2000.

Traders and investors use the CCI to help identify price reversals, price extremes and trend strength. As with most indicators, the CCI should be used in conjunction with other aspects of technical analysis. CCI fits into the momentum category of oscillators. In addition to momentum, volume indicators and the price chart may also influence a technical assessment.

**CCI Divergence Trading - A Simple System You Can Use**  
May 27, 2009  
  
Today I want to share with you a very simple trading system that is based entirely on CCI divergence. CCI is a pretty useful indicator in itself but it's even more effective when you trade divergence patterns.   
In trading circles divergence is basically where the price makes new highs but the indicator in question, ie the CCI in this case, fails to make new highs. Similarly in a downward trend the price is making new lows but the indicator is failing to make new lows.  
These divergence patterns indicate that a reversal is about to take place because the trend is starting to run out of momentum, and they are generally very strong signals.  
So getting back to the CCI divergence trading system, I recommend you plot the price chart along with two CCI indicators - the CCI (10) and CCI (60). You may like to try other settings but I find these work extremely well.  
Then you want to wait for a divergence pattern to emerge on BOTH of these indicators. You can use just one indicator but I recommend using both of them if you want to identify the very best signals.  
To give you an example there was an excellent set-up on the GBP/USD pair yesterday morning (on the 15 minute chart). You can see from the chart below that although the price didn't actually trade lower, it did form a perfect double bottom formation (indicated by the grey vertical line), and yet when it did so both the CCI indicators failed to make new lows, which was a very positive sign that a reversal was about to take place, and which turned out to be correct in this case.  
  
[http://theforexarticles.com/wp-conte...potmay27_1.png](http://theforexarticles.com/wp-content/uploads/image/GBP_USD%20Spotmay27_1.png)  
  
As with all trading systems this simple CCI divergence system isn't foolproof but it can provide you with some excellent signals on occasions.

**How To Use the CCI Indicator**  
Sun, 06/28/2009  
  
The Commodity Channel Index (CCI) Indicator was developed by Donald Lambert, and is a traditional technical indicator. It is based on the average of the deviation between the Moving Average and the Typical Price (Average of high, low and close).  
It is commonly used to identify periods where price is overbought and oversold - where the price is far from the Moving Average. It is also use to gauge trend direction by looking if it is positive or negative.   
  
**Calculation**  
The CCI is calculated in the following way:  
1\. Calculate a 14-bars Simple Moving Average of the Typical Price. The Typical Price is defined as (High+Low+Close)/3.  
2\. Calculate the Mean Deviation of Typical Price and SMA of TP for the 14-bars.  
3\. Apply the following formula:  
CCI = (Typical Price - SMATP) / (0.015 * Mean Deviation)  
Practically, the CCI gives a numerical representation of standard deviation of price from its Simple Moving Average. Smaller CCI values indicate that price is closer to its Moving Average, and bigger CCI values indicate that price is more distant than its Moving Average.  
  
**Method 1: Woodies CCI Zero-Line-Reject**  
A method that incorporates the CCI Indicator is Woodies CCI, developed by Ken Wood. He trades the CCI by trading several patterns that occurs on it. One pattern traded is the Zero-Line-Reject. It happens when CCI becomes close to its zero line, but bounces back to its previous direction.   
This pattern is actually parallel to the price getting closer to a moving average - and bouncing from it. This is the logic behind the entry - Moving Average that serves as support area.   
  
Example:  
[http://www.indicatorforex.com/indica...ine-reject.jpg](http://www.indicatorforex.com/indicators/cci-zero-line-reject.jpg)  
  
This is a highly powerful method that provides strong entry signals. However, it is usually more profitable to trade it using the Moving Average itself, rather than by the CCI. By trading with the Moving Average the trader can judge the trend's strength by looking at the slope of the MA. This allows for more reliable signals and filters ranging periods.   
  
**Method 2: Zero-Line Cross**  
This is a simple method of trading with the CCI indicator, which is based on the Zero-line. Its rules are the following:  
Buy when CCI crosses its zero-line from below.  
Sell when CCI crosses its zero-line from above.  
  
Example:  
[http://www.indicatorforex.com/indica...i-zl-cross.jpg](http://www.indicatorforex.com/indicators/cci-zl-cross.jpg)  
**  
Method 3: Trend-Line Break**  
This method is also a part of the Woodies CCI method. It is also used on other indicators, such as the Momentum. Its basis is the breakout of trendlines that are seen on the chart of the _CCI_. Once trendline is identified, trader enters the trade after it is broken by price.

**Timing Trades With The Commodity Channel Index**  
Posted: Apr 18, 2005  
  
The [Commodity Channel Index](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commoditychannelindex.asp) (CCI) is an [oscillator](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/oscillator.asp) originally developed by Donald Lambert and featured in his book "Commodities Channel Index: Tools for Trading Cyclical Trends". Since its introduction, the indicator has grown in popularity and is now a very common tool for traders to identify cyclical trends not only in commodities but also equities and currencies. In this article, we'll take a look at what exactly the CCI calculates, and how you can apply it to enhance your trading. **  
  
Understanding the CCI** Like most oscillators, the CCI was developed to determine [overbought](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/overbought.asp) and [oversold](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/oversold.asp) levels. The CCI does this by measuring the relation between price and a [moving average](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/movingaverage.asp) (MA), or, more specifically, normal deviations from that average. The actual CCI calculation, shown below, illustrates how this measurement is made.   
[http://i.investopedia.com/inv/articl...ingTrades1.gif](http://i.investopedia.com/inv/articles/site/ATTimingTrades1.gif) The one prerequisite to calculating the CCI is determining a _time interval_ , which plays a key role in enhancing the accuracy of the CCI. Since it's trying to predict a cycle using moving averages, the more attuned the moving average amounts (days averaged) are to the cycle, the more accurate the average will be. This is true for most oscillators. So, although most traders use the default setting of 20 as the time interval for the CCI calculation, a more accurate time interval reduces the occurrence of false signals. Here are four simple steps to determining the optimal interval for the calculation: 

  1. Open up the stock's yearly chart.
  2. Locate two highs or two lows on the chart.
  3. Take note of the time interval between these two highs or lows (cycle length).
  4. Divide that time interval by three to get the optimal time interval to use in the calculation (1/3 of the cycle).

Here's an example of this method applied to Sun Microsystems (SUNW):  
  
[http://i.investopedia.com/inv/articl...ingTrades3.gif](http://i.investopedia.com/inv/articles/site/ATTimingTrades3.gif)   
Figure 1: Chart courtesy of [StockCharts.com](http://stockcharts.com/index.html)   
  
Here we can see that one cycle (from low to low) starts at Oct 6 and finishes on Aug 9. This represents roughly 225 trading days, which, divided by three, gives a time interval of about 75.   
**  
Applying the CCI** Since it was invented, the CCI calculation has been added as an indicator to many charting applications, eliminating the need (thankfully) to do the calculations manually. Most of these charting applications simply require you to input the time interval that you would like to use. Figure 2 shows a default CCI chart for SUNW:

Note that the CCI actually looks just like any other oscillator, and it is used in much the same way. (To learn more about oscillators, see [_Getting to Know Oscillators_](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/technical/070301.asp).) Here are the basic rules for interpreting the CCI:  
_Possible sell signals:_

  1. The CCI crosses above 100 and has started to curve downwards.
  2. There is [bearish](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bear.asp) [divergence](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/divergence.asp) between the CCI and the actual price movement, characterized by downward movement in the CCI while the price of the asset continues to move higher or moves sideways.

_Possible buy signals:_  

  1. The CCI crosses below -100 and has started to curve upwards.
  2. There is a [bullish](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bull.asp) divergence between the CCI and the actual price movement, characterized by upward movement in the CCI while the price of the asset continues to move downward or sidesways.

Figure 3 shows another chart of SUNW, but for this chart, the time interval of 75 (which we calculated above) was used for the calculation:

Figure 3: Chart courtesy of [StockCharts.com](http://stockcharts.com/index.html)   
  
The red arrows show turning points that emit sell signals, while the green arrow shows a turning point emitting buy signals. The short blue lines, indicating the impending trends, show the divergence between the CCI and price. **  
  
Always Get Confirmation** It is extremely important - as with many trading tools - to use the CCI with _other indicators_. [Pivot points](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pivotpoint.asp) work well with the CCI because both methods attempt to find turning points. Some traders also add moving averages into the mix. In Figure 3 above, you can see that the 60-day [exponential moving average](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ema.asp) (violet horizontal line) provides a good [support](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/support.asp) level; however, determining which MA level is best varies by stock (to learn more, see [_Introduction To Moving Averages_](http://www.investopedia.com/university/movingaverage/default.asp) _)_.   
  
Another possible supplement to the CCI is the use of [candlestick patterns](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/candlestick.asp), which can help confirm exact tops and bottoms throughout the CCI's "selling period" (time in which it is above 100) or "buying period" (time in which it is below -100).   
**  
Conclusion**   
The Commodity Channel Index is an extremely useful tool for traders to determine cyclical buying and selling points. Traders can utilize this tool most effectively by (a) calculating an exact time interval and (b) using it in conjunction with several other forms of technical.

**Trading Forex with Woodies CCI**  
  
**Woodies CCI system is particularly popular with futures traders, but can it work with forex? We look at what the system is, and how it can be applied in the currency markets.**  
  
**What Is Woodies CCI?**  
  
"Woodie" is a day trader of 25+ years experience, and is well known among traders of index futures such as the EMini S&P 500 and the EMini Nasdaq 100. His system is based on a number of patterns made by the Commodity Channel Index (CCI) indicator. It's a little different to most indicator-based systems, and traders tend to either swear _by_ it or swear _at_ it, but there is no doubt that its creator trades very successfully with it day in day out.   
  
The CCI itself is a momentum indicator. Such indicators all work in the same basic fashion - they plot the difference between a "fast" measure of price and a "slow" measure. The MACD for example, measures the difference between a fast and slow moving average. In the case of the CCI, the "fast" measure is the price itself, and the "slow" measure is a moving average. Thus when we look at the CCI, what we are actually seeing is measurement of the deviation of price from its moving average, normalised to fit on a scale of roughly -250 to +250. A chart example will make this clearer:   
  
<http://www.forexheaven.com/charts/woodies-cci-a.png>   
  
Here we have plotted a 14 period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) - the orange line - and a 14 period CCI - the lower graph. In simple terms, the "0" line on the CCI section of the chart can be thought of as representing the EMA, and the CCI line itself (the yellow line) as representing the price.   
  
Thus we can see that at the extreme left of the chart, as the price accelerates through its EMA, so the CCI crosses above the zero-line. When the price consolidates and the EMA catches up with it, so the CCI starts to fall back towards the zero-line. The price rises again, but this time not by as great a magnitude as the previous move, and this is seen on the CCI graph by the CCI rising but not reaching it's previous high.   
  
This "divergence" between the price making a new high and the CCI failing to do so is a signal that momentum in the up move is slowing, and that the move may be over, at least for the time being. This is essentially how all momentum indicators work.   
  

  

"Woodies CCI" system then, outlines a number of tradable patterns made by the CCI. His chart setup is simple enough, at its most basic he uses a 14-period CCI, and that's it. Some followers of Woodie even take the price of their chart, preferring to trade from the indicator patterns alone - although we don't recommend this. The Woodie patterns fall into two main categories, trend following and counter trend.   
  
**Trading Woodies CCI On Forex**  
  
One of the most commonly traded Woodie CCI patterns is the "zero line reject" - the CCI bouncing from its zero line. Given what we know about what the CCI is telling us, we can see that a zero line reject is actually the price bouncing from it's Moving Average. But the CCI can provide additional confirmation for the trade. Here is the same chart as above, which is in fact the GBP/USD pair, with a trend line drawn in. However the trend is not drawn on the price as you might expect, but on the indicator:   
  

<http://www.forexheaven.com/charts/woodies-cci-1.png>

  
The highlighted area shows the CCI bouncing from the zero-line, but there are two other indications given by the CCI that confirm this trade:   
  
1 - The CCI has been above the zero line for more than six consecutive bars. This is a signal that the overall trend is upwards, and hence we are looking for Long trades. If you think back to what the CCI measures, this is common sense because it means the price is staying above its moving average.   
  
2 - The CCI trend line that starts several bars back has been broken to the upside. This break can be used to confirm the zero-bounce. Notice that the break of the CCI trend line actually occurs _before_ the price breaks upwards - hence the CCI often being referred to as a leading indicator. This is where the CCI really helps us by clearly showing what wouldn't be obvious by looking at the price/MA combination alone.   
  
Thus we have three indications in total that the price is potentially going to rise. The trend line break would be the final confirmation for entry, and as we have said, would get us into the Long, before the price explodes upwards.   
  
That takes us in, but what about getting out? Woodies CCI has the answer for that too. There are two possible exits, depending on how cautiously we want to trade.   
  
1 - Hook down from extreme. A reading of greater than +200 or less than -200 on the CCI is considered an extreme reading, and when the indicator turns back from beyond these values, it suggests the price will at least consolidate, and possibly fall back. The first and most conservative exit then, is the first red candle after entry, when the CCI turns back from around +300 - a very extreme reading.   
  
2 - Crossing 100 line. If we wanted to try and run the trade for longer, then waiting until the CCI crosses back below the +100 line is the way to go. This implies momentum has fallen away and the price will follow. Using this second method here would have yielded a few additional pips.   
  
Typically, traders of Woodies system trade very short timescales - 3 or 5 minute charts being common. For forex we recommend a slower chart is used to maximise returns and take advantage of the relatively wider swings that the currency markets provide. The Cable example above is a 30 minute chart, and the trade yielded around 80 pips in no more than a couple of hours. This is trading only one simple with-the-trend setup, and there are further tools in Woodies trading toolkit that add up to even more opportunities each day.   
  
_The forex angels say_ : Woodies CCI system is slated as working on any market, and we believe it's certainly well suited to forex - but use the longer timeframes to get the best out of it. As with any system, it takes some learning and a lot of practise, but the relative simplicity and the number of setups available make it attractive to those who like to trade with discretion.

**What Is Woodies CCI?**  
  
“Woodie” is a day trader of 25+ years experience, and is well known among traders of index futures such as the EMini S&P 500 and the EMini Nasdaq 100. His system is based on a number of patterns made by the Commodity Channel Index (CCI) indicator. It’s a little different to most indicator-based systems, and traders tend to either swear by it or swear at it, but there is no doubt that its creator trades very successfully with it day in day out. The CCI itself is a momentum indicator. Such indicators all work in the same basic [fashion](http://www.stylight.de/) – they plot the difference between a “fast” measure of price and a “slow” measure. The MACD for example, measures the difference between a fast and slow moving average. In the case of the CCI, the “fast” measure is the price itself, and the “slow” measure is a moving average. Thus when we look at the CCI, what we are actually seeing is measurement of the deviation of price from its moving average, normalised to fit on a scale of roughly -250 to +250.  
  
**Trend Patterns**  
  
**ZLR**  
1) Trend SHOULD BE in place. At least 6 bars or more.  
2) CCI above 100 during the trend.  
3) CCI dips below 100. Can go to ZL, even cross it.  
4) Chop zone is Blue or Brown for at least 3 points or more in the trend direction.  
5) Sidewinder is yellow or green.  
6) CCI points change between bars must be +15 to +20 (Green or Blue).  
7) CCI turns up and stays up with 20secs to bar close. This is the trigger.  
8) CCI bar must not close above 120. That would be chasing a trade.  
9) LSMA is NOT used.  
  
**TLB**  
1) CCI SHOULD BE in an established trend above 100 line.  
2) CCI is preferred to be in a trend above the 200 line.  
3) Chop zone indicator is NOT used.  
4) Sidewinder in NOT used.  
5) LSMA is NOT used.  
6) Trend Line Break is the trigger.  
7) The closer the actual trend-line break is to the Zero Line the better.  
  
**TONY TRADE**  
1) CCI SHOULD BE in an established trend (at least 6 bars or more).  
2) CCI prints a minimum 4 bars on the other side of Zero Line (against the trend).  
3) CCI SHOULD NOT print more than 9 bars on the other side of Zero Line.  
4) NOT A SINGLE BAR on the other side should CROSS the 100 line.  
5) Look for TLB now. Then the crossing of the Zero line triggers the trade.  
6) TLB alone may also trigger the trade. This may be termed an aggressive trade.  
7) LSMA, CZI, SI are NOT used in this trade.  
  
**GB100 (A ZLR that has gone too far)**  
1) CCI SHOULD BE in an established trend (at least 6 bars or more).  
2) CCI goes to the other side of the Zero Line.  
3) CCI crosses the 100 line on the other side.  
4) CCI SHOULD NOT print more than 6 bars on the other side.  
5) TLB back towards the original trend AND crossing the 100 line is the trigger.  
6) CZI SHOULD BE Blue/Brown IN AGREEMENT with the ORIGINAL TREND.  
7) LSMA and SI are NOT used  
  
**Against the trend patterns**  
  
**FAMIR**  
1) It is a FAILED ZLR.  
2) LSMA SHOULD BE green for upside FAMIR and red for downside FAMIR.  
3) The FAMIR SHOULD form between the +50 and -50 lines.  
4) Completion of the Z shape at 20secs to bar close is the trigger.  
5) CZI is NOT used.  
6) SI is NOT used.  
  
**VEGAS TRADE**  
1) CCI MUST cross 200 line in the established direction of the trend.  
2) CCI then reverses and MUST cross the 100 line.  
3) CCI starts rounding after making a swing low/high.  
4) CCI rounding can look like a cup OR peaks and valleys.  
5) CCI rounding of between 3 and 10 bars is required.  
6) CCI may or may not cross the 100 line during the rounding period.  
7) CCI crossing of the swing low/high after the rounding is the trigger.  
8) LSMA SHOULD BE green for upside move and red for downside move.  
9) CZI and SI are NOT used.  
  
**GHOST**  
1) CCI must make 3 peaks encapsulating 2 valleys.  
2) The 2 valleys are connected by drawing a line.  
3) This line is also extended to the right (in the future).  
4) CCI violation of this line for a 3rd time triggers the trade.  
5) CZI, SI, LSMA are NOT used.  
6) GHOST can form in any direction with any slant.  
7) Woodie believes the slant towards the Zero Line is preferable.  
8) A Ghost is a Ghost is a Ghost.

Tade Example - Tading the CCI(14) Top & Bottom in close contact with the Divergence & the Pivotal Points  
  
Trading the Tops & Bottoms with the CCI(14) Indicator in close contact with a Divergence could be easy and profitable.  
  
Point A indicates a Short Trade whereas Point B has triggered a Long Entry Order. I wouldn't set a SL much too tight at H1 Level in a choppy market environment.

EURUSD, H1, 2011 November 12  
  
Trade Example - Exit  
  
Exit could be done at Point "A" or Point "B"  
  
Stay in the trade as long as no candle closes below the MA20 Line (say the middle Line of BB) (= SMA20, a Simple Moving Average Line, Period: 20, Shift: 0, MA Method: Simple, Apply to: Close) at H1-Level by setting a Trailing Stop and let the win run or wait at a Pivotal Point for the Exit Order.

See #[**40**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5128354#post5128354)  
  
Hi forja  
  
It could be now several misconceptions.  
(1) You pointed out a hidden bearish divergence. The reason it's called "hidden" is because it's hiding inside the current trend. This occurs when price makes a lower high (LH), but the oscillator is making a higher high (HH). By now you've probably guessed that this occurs in a downtrend. When you see hidden bearish divergence, chances are that the pair will continue to shoot lower and continue the downtrend. But there isn't no downtrend at H4 or the Daily.  
(2) Where have you set the entry? See the chart, please: Entry Short: Box "A" & Entry Long: Box "B".   
For the Entry Short (Box "A") you could have 3 Exit possibilities.   
  
I think now it's clear, isn't it?  
  
Kindest regards  
FXcube

GBPCAD, H1, 2011 November 13  
  
Trade Example  
CCI(14) Top & Bottom Trading with the Bollinger Bands, the Divergence and the Pivotal Points  
  
Trading the CCI(14) Top & Bottom in close contact with the Bollinger Bands and/or Divergence and/or the Pivotal Points could be easy and efficient.  
  
Preferred Trades: A (Short), B (Exit & Long), C (Exit & Short), D (Exit & Long), D1 (Exit & Short), E (Short), F (Exit & Long), G (Long), H (Exit).  
No trades anymore because it's Friday evening (GMT +1).  
  
Divergences: At Divergence Market Environments you could also take a Double Short (D1 & E) and a Long twice (F & G).   
Once again:  
When I see Divergences near the Pivotal Points I go in the market with one more Order most of the time.   
Example: Divergence 1/ D1 Short & E Short and Divergence 2/ F Long & G Long.  
  
When Daily and H4 Candles seems moving in a Range (see #[**46**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5128840#post5128840), please) it could be an excellent market environment for the H1 Trading with the CCI(14) Tops- and Bottom Trading associated with the Bollinger Bands (20/2 and 20/3). (20/2 means "Period": 20, "Deviations": 2, "Shift": 0, "Apply to": Close).  
  
The Money Management could be 10% for every trade of e.g. a normal Trade Sizes (0.1/1 Lot or so). So I am in the market at Divergence Market Environments with two Orders (20% of the Maxima). The reason why I trade with one-tenth most of the time is that I can go in the market with more orders at different time-frames and at different currency-pairs and reduce my risk in so doing.  
  
Kindest regards  
FXcube

EURUSD, M15, 2011 November 15  
EURUSD, M30, 2011 November 15  
  
Trading Example   
CCI-Time-Cell-Trading  
  
Trading the CCI(14) Tops & Bottoms could be done at every Time Frame with the same currency pair.  
  
The example below shows good entry opportunities at different time frames near a Pivotal Point with Divergences.  
The CCI(14) Indicator at M1, M5 and M30 has pointed out a "positive Divergence". The Market Price has coming down till a daily important Pivotal Point (mS2 1.3506) and the CCI(14) Indicator is turning out a "Bottom-Status" (BS) at all time frames.  
  
You could also make only one market entry Long when all time frames (M1, M5, M15, M30) are signalizing an excellent entry opportunity (here a CCI-Bottom).

Hi Rob216  
Ranging activities (non-trending, sideways state) constitute 50% of the Forex market. When you accept to qualify the features how to trade the range market,... the other 50% of the Forex Market will be open up to you.   
  
You could find many Range Bound Strategies at:

Good Luck!

You could close it (#[**51**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5135639#post5135639)) with +2 Pips (1.3542) win just now. I let this M5-Order further open in the market because M15 and M30 signalize a CCI(14) Top but that have not say anything after London Market Close. So it's a little risky to let it open. Conservative traders should better to close it. However if you look at M30 you could recognize a "Bearish Hidden Divergence".  
  
M30 - Bearish Hidden Divergence  
Be aware, that the Bearish Hidden Divergence at M30 could be a powerful argument for a downward movement, also.This too is a continuation pattern as the bearish trend is expected to continue. You also have to look closely at the CCI in chart M30. The CCI seems to be already in overbought territory and the indicator is making higher highs.  
  
Characteristics: 

  1. Trend continuation
  2. Lower highs in price
  3. Higher highs in indicator

  
Kindest regards  
FXcube

Maybe it's not necessary to close it. I've close this open Short position before night just now (22:20 GMT+1) . See #[**60**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5136133#post5136133), please.

Thanks FC. Yea, there is a rather long story about why I cannot update that site anymore.  
  
Anyway, your thread inspired me, so this AM (EST) I put the CCI and the currency strength indy (CCp) on the 5min/1min EURUSD.  
  
I'll be a son-of-a-gun if I didn't pick up +15 pips in 3 trades (100% win) in about an hour. I took my profits to early, but profit is profit.  
  
As many years as I have been programming and trading, I have underestimated the power of divergence. You have certainly shed some light on a very powerful trading phenomenon.  
  
Hopefully your thread will inspire others to try it.  
  
Carl  
  
PS. Thanks for the V!

FC, I hope you don't mind that I post an example of what I like to look at now...  
  
EURUSD 5m, with CCI and CCp strengths.  
  
When CCI divergence occurs and there is a simultaneous divergence of the EUR and the USD strength, there is a HIGH probability of a reversal.  
  
And on a side note, the green dash lines are call option barriers.

Dollar weakness divergence coincided with this latest CCI divergence.  
Support failed at the second option barrier. Looks like this bottom barrier may be tested again.  
  
I need to write a script to watch and alert me for these divergences in real-time on all timeframes. I have missed some great setups this AM.

300.-$ Real Account (only for educational purposes)  
Profit Today 12.51$ (+4%).  
  
_A birth in the hand is worth two in the bush._  
  
Trading in little 0.05-0.1% profit trades (say 15 Cents - 30 Cents per Trade with a 300.-$ Account) could be an advantage for your benefits. If you manage these Orders several times a day (five times - ten times as much) you could earn 0.5-1% a Day or many times over. It's pretty much the same if you use this tactic with a 30'000.-$ Account or a 300'000.-$ Account or a 3 Billion Account. Same difference!  
Kindest regards

**Divergence Trading**  
  
What if there was a low risk way to sell near the top or buy near the bottom of a [trend](http://www.babypips.com/school/what-is-a-trending-market.html)?  
  
What if you were already in a long position and you could know ahead of time the perfect place to exit instead of watching your unrealized gains, a.k.a your potential Aston Martin down payment, vanish before your eyes because your trade reverses direction?  
What if you believe a currency pair will continue to fall but would like to short at a better price or a less risky entry?  
Well guess what? There is a way! It's called **divergence trading**.  
In a nutshell, divergence can be seen by comparing price action and the movement of an indicator. It doesn't really matter what indicator you use. You can use [RSI](http://www.babypips.com/school/relative-strength-index.html), [MACD](http://www.babypips.com/school/macd.html), the [stochastic](http://www.babypips.com/school/stochastic.html), CCI, etc.   
The great thing about divergences is that you can use them as a [leading indicator](http://www.babypips.com/school/leading-indicators-oscillators.html), and after some practice it's not too difficult to spot.  
When traded properly, you can be consistently profitable with divergences. The best thing about divergences is that you're usually buying near the bottom or selling near the top. This makes the risk on your trades are very small relative to your potential reward.   
Cha-ching!  
  
**Higher Highs and Lower Lows**  
  
Just think "higher highs" and "lower lows".  
Price and momentum normally move hand in hand like Hansel and Gretel, Batman and Robin, Serena and Venus Williams, salt and pepper...You get the point.   
  
[http://babypips.cachefly.net/school/...divergence.png](http://babypips.cachefly.net/school/images/grade11/forex-divergence.png)  
  
If price is making **higher highs** , the oscillator should also be making **higher highs**. If price is making **lower lows** , the oscillator should also be making **lower lows**.  
If they are NOT, that means price and the [oscillator](http://www.babypips.com/school/leading-indicators-oscillators.html) are diverging from each other. And that's why it's called "divergence."  
  
  
Divergence trading is an awesome tool to have in your toolbox because divergences signal to you that something fishy is going on and that you should pay closer attention.   
Using divergence trading can be useful in spotting a weakening trend or [reversal](http://www.babypips.com/school/identifying-reversals.html) in momentum. Sometimes you can even use it as a signal for a trend to continue!  
There are **TWO** types of divergence:

  1. Regular
  2. Hidden

In this grade, we will teach you how to spot these divergences and how to trade them. We'll even have a sweet surprise for you at the end.

**Divergence**  

  1. Divergence is a basic concept you may apply in different ways. In essence, it involves comparing price activity to any other charted element. When price moves in the opposite direction of this other element, it is said to be "diverging." The concept assumes that the compared element significantly measures or leads price activity and that any discrepancies tend to resolve in favor of this other chart element. For example, if prices are rising but the second charted element is declining, a trader may expect prices to turn around soon and also decline, following this other element.

**Complex trading system #3 (MACD Divergence)**  
  
Currency: EUR/USD (preferred) or any other.  
Time frame: 30 min.  
Indicators: MACD (5, 26, 1) – draw 0 line,  
Full Stochastic (14, 3, 3)  
EMA 3  
SMA 13  
  
Trading rules: watch for divergence between the price on the chart and MACD or between price on the chart and Stochastic.  
Once divergence spotted, wait for EMA 3 and SMA 13 to cross and enter the trade in the direction of EMA 3.  
Set stop loss at 26 pips.  
  
Take half of the profit at 20 pips; let the rest to run further with trailing stop in place.   
  
  

[http://forex-strategies-revealed.com...strategy_3.png](http://forex-strategies-revealed.com/files/pictures_strategies/c_strategy_3.png)  
  

Divergence on Stochastic can be found the same way as on MACD. The reason for using both MACD and Stochastic is that one of the indicators can show divergence while the other will not at given period of time.

**Divergence Forex Trading Strategy**  
  
Forex Reversal Strategies | Written by Diederich Maheim |   
  
Divergences are most commonly used in forex to predict price reversals in both up and down trending markets. In a nutshell, divergences occur when the currency pair price and the technical indicator (MACD, RSI, STOCH,...) trade in opposite directions. Normally, price should always trade in agreement with the supporting TA indicator, both up or down. The big advantage of trading divergences is that they offer you low risk to reward trades since you're ready to buy currencies near a bottom or sell near the top.  
  
**A. Forex Bullish Divergence Trading**  
Bullish divergences occur where the currency price trades lower while indicator readings go higher. Bullish divergences suggest a likely move to the upside. Let's take a look at bullish divergence and how to profit from this tool. Below is a 4 hour chart of GBP/USD.   
  

[http://www.fxtsp.com/images/stories/...ce-trading.gif](http://www.fxtsp.com/images/stories/strategies/forexpatterns/forex-bullish2-divergence-trading.gif)

  
The GBP/USD make lower lows while the MACD indicator make higher lows, thus creating bullish divergence in the chart above. We could enter a long position at 1.5733 with stop loss 1 pip below the supporting trend line at 1.5646. The long trade was confirmed by the hammer candlestick pattern.   
  
**B. Forex Bearish Divergence Trading**  
As opposed to bullish divergences, bearish divergences occur where the currency price trades higher while indicator readings move lower. Bearish divergences suggest a likely move to the downside. Let's take a look at an example. Below is a daily chart of EUR/USD.  
  

[http://www.fxtsp.com/images/stories/...ce-trading.gif](http://www.fxtsp.com/images/stories/strategies/forexpatterns/forex-bullish-divergence-trading.gif)

  
In the chart above, we could enter a short position at 1.4035 with stop loss at 1.4285 for a short ride towards 1.3570 (so far). The trade was confirmed by a bearish candlestick pattern.   
  
**Another example: EUR/USD 1 Min Chart**  
  

[http://www.fxtsp.com/images/stories/...ex-scalper.gif](http://www.fxtsp.com/images/stories/strategies/forexpatterns/divergence-forex-scalper.gif)

  
As shown in the chart above, trading divergences can be used by forex scalpers as well. The short trade was confirmed by a small triangle pattern that appeared on the EUR/USD 1 min chart.

Today I want to share with you a very simple trading system that is based entirely on CCI divergence. CCI is a pretty useful indicator in itself but it's even more effective when you trade divergence patterns.   
In trading circles divergence is basically where the price makes new highs but the indicator in question, ie the CCI in this case, fails to make new highs. Similarly in a downward trend the price is making new lows but the indicator is failing to make new lows.  
These divergence patterns indicate that a reversal is about to take place because the trend is starting to run out of momentum, and they are generally very strong signals.  
So getting back to the CCI divergence trading system, I recommend you plot the price chart along with two CCI indicators - the CCI (10) and CCI (60). You may like to try other settings but I find these work extremely well.  
Then you want to wait for a divergence pattern to emerge on BOTH of these indicators. You can use just one indicator but I recommend using both of them if you want to identify the very best signals.  
To give you an example there was an excellent set-up on the GBP/USD pair yesterday morning (on the 15 minute chart). You can see from the chart below that although the price didn't actually trade lower, it did form a perfect double bottom formation (indicated by the grey vertical line), and yet when it did so both the CCI indicators failed to make new lows, which was a very positive sign that a reversal was about to take place, and which turned out to be correct in this case.

As with all trading systems this simple CCI divergence system isn't foolproof but it can provide you with some excellent signals on occasions.

****Complex trading system #8 (CCI Divergence Breakout)****  
  
Submitted by User on April 9, 2009 - 15:01.   
_This strategy is actually one of my favorite divergence strategies and takes little practice to expert it._  
_Warm Regards,  
Navin Prithyani._  
  
Timeframe : 15mins and above  
Indicator : CCI (Commodity Channel Index)  
Strategy By : Navin Prithyani [www.urbanforex.com](http://www.urbanforex.com/)  
  
Description : This strategy uses hidden divergence and price action to take a breakout trade. Divergence is the one key indication in the market that can be useful and is not lagging. It is a sign of a market reversal coming up in the near future. Understanding and making use of divergence will help a technical trader greatly when analyzing the market.

Note : On my CCI, I always connect my peaks (tops) never the bottoms (dips). It is critical that you watch the video tutorial below with this strategy to understand it fully.  
  
Long Breakout  
\- Price must be trending downwards  
\- CCI must go towards the upward direction and bounce  
\- After a bounce on the CCI, connect your high peaks on your price  
\- Aggressive : At a clear close above the trend line enter long  
\- Conservative : After the trend line is broken, wait for a pullback to the trend line to enter   
  
Short Breakout  
\- Price must be trending upwards  
\- CCI must go towards the downward direction and bounce  
\- After a bounce on the CCI, connect your dips on your price  
\- Aggressive : At a clear close below the trend line enter short  
\- Conservative : After the trend line is broken, wait for a pullback to the trend line to enter   
  
Stops  
\- If your trend line is not that steep, you can keep your stops at the high/low of the breakout candle.  
\- If your trend line is steep, keep your stop at the swing high/low  
\- If your trend line is medium steep, keep your stop at the low of couple candles away Exits  
\- 1:1 Risk to reward. If your stop is -12 pips your limit should be +12 pips.  
\- Open 2 lots. If your stop is at -10 pips, once your trades goes in your favor and you're at +10 pips, close 1 lot and let the other one run.   
  
Exit at Support and Resistance levels.  
\- Exit at the nearest 50 or 00 level. These are psychological levels. (make sure your exit is at least the same number of pips as your stop, otherwise dont enter the trade)  
\- Trailing Stop. Once in a trade, at the close of each candle, place your stop 1 pip below the low (if in a buy trade). Vise versa for sell trade.

Forex trading system "CCI Divergence Trading"  
**Added: 2010-09-14 10:46:27 by Dexter**  
[http://www.free-forex-systems.com/up...10007/logo.gif](http://www.free-forex-systems.com/uploads/10007/logo.gif)   
  
**Trading system based on divergence trading method**   
Divergence is a useful tool for finding price reversal points from support and resistance zones. It usually gives us a relatively early signals compared to those given by moving average indicators. It can be successfully applied to many technical indicators and end up with good results.  
This system makes use of two indicators. The first one is the Divergence indicator that will plot the divergence lines and the second one is the Bollinger Band. The Divergence indicator gives buy/sell signal according to the type of divergence that was detected. The indicator also is capable of drawing divergence lines for the whole history prices located within a specific chart.  
  
**Details**  
**Categories:** Technical, Day Trading, Metatrader Only, Divergence  
**Timeframes:** 5 Minutes  
**Currency pairs:** ANY  
**Trading sessions:** US Session (New York), European Session (London)  
  
**Indicators used**

  1. **Divergence**  
Fast Ema: 12  
Slow Ema: 26  
Singal Ema: 9

  1. **Bollinger Band**  
Period: 20  
Deviation: 2

**Entry rules**  
The entry rule is based on two indicators, namely the Divergence Indicator and the Bollinger Band. When the price is below the Bollinger band and the divergence indicator show an up arrow, we will open a buy trade. Vice versa, when the price is above the Bollinger band and the divergence indicator show a down arrow, we will open a sell trade as shown in the example below.

**Trade management**  
Once entered the market, we will need to set the Stop Loss to 20 pips and we close the trade in profit when the price touches the middle line of the Bollinger band.  
  
**Exit rules**  
The trade will exit once the price touches the middle line of the Bollinger band. As you can see in the picture below, we close the sell trade when the price touches the middle line of the Bollinger band as shown below.

**Advantages**  
Divergence is a useful tool that can gives us a relatively early signals compared to those given by moving average indicators. Combined with Bollinger Band, it can give up good results.  
  
**Disadvantages**  
We need to follow the rules and wait patiently for the divergence and the Bollinger band to give us the signal.

**Online-Handel mit grossen Preisunterschieden**  
  
**Assetinum hat die Gebühren von 16 Online-Brokern im Rahmen des bisher umfassendsten Schweizer Online-Trading-Vergleichs inklusive aller Kosten unter die Lupe genommen. Die Preisunterschiede sind enorm: Die teuersten Anbieter sind achtmal so teuer wie die günstigsten Discount-Broker.**  
  
Online-Broker bieten Anlegern, die ihr Glück selbst in die Hand nehmen wollen, eine vielfältige Spielwiese. Hier können nicht nur professionelle Händler, sondern auch Privatanleger mit einem geringeren Budget auf eigene Faust Wertschriften handeln.  
  
**Intransparenter Tarifdschungel**  
Doch der Tarifdschungel ist selbst für Profis schwierig zu durchschauen. Die Gebühren können je nach gehandeltem Finanzprodukt sowie der Höhe und der Anzahl Transaktionen von Anbieter zu Anbieter variieren. Hinzu kommen eidgenössische Umsatzabgaben und eine Reihe von unterschiedlichen Pauschaltarifen, Rabattierungen und Depotgebühren. Externe Kosten wie Börsengebühren wurden Assetinum häufig erst auf Nachfrage kommuniziert und konnten selbst von vielen Banken erst nach mehrmaligem Korrigieren richtig angegeben werden.  
  
**Wenig- und Vieltrader im Vergleich**  
Um Ordnung ins Kostenchaos zu bringen, hat Assetinum die Gesamtkosten von 16 Online-Handelsplattformen in der Schweiz anhand von zwei idealtypischen Kunden verglichen. Trading-Kunde A führt als «Wenigtrader» vier Aktien-Transaktionen im Jahr durch und verfügt über ein Depot von 50'000 Franken mit Schweizer Aktien, Obligationen und Indexfonds. Trading-Kunde B verfügt als «Vieltrader» über ein grösseres Depot von 500'000 Franken, darunter Schweizer, amerikanische und europäische Aktien, Indexfonds, Obligationen sowie Gold-ETFs und realisiert 30 Käufe und Verkäufe im Jahr.  
  
**Saxo Bank, Keytrade Bank, Swissquote und PostFinance auf dem Podest**  
Der Vergleich von Assetinum zeigt, dass die Saxo Bank für beide Kundenkategorien am günstigsten ist. Ohne Handelsaktivität und einem Barsaldo unter 25'000 Franken wird bei der Saxo Bank allerdings eine Kontogebühr von 100 Franken pro Halbjahr fällig. In der Kategorie Wenigtrader holt sich die Keytrade Bank die Silbermedaille knapp vor PostFinance. Für Vieltrader ist ebenfalls Keytrade der zweitgünstigste Anbieter; Bronze geht in dieser Kategorie an Swissquote mit einem Vieltrader-Pauschaltarif.  
  
**Grosse Kostenunterschiede**  
Die Gebührenunterschiede sind erstaunlich gross: [Universalbanken wie die Bank Coop, UBS oder Credit Suisse](http://www.assetinum.com/de/online-broker-vergleich-2011-universalbanken.html) sind massiv teurer als [«spezialisierte» Online-Broker](http://www.assetinum.com/de/online-broker-vergleich-2011-resultate.html). So ist die Credit Suisse für den untersuchten Wenigtrader mehr als sechsmal so teuer wie die Saxo Bank, für den Vieltrader sogar fast achtmal so teuer – das ist eine Differenz von mehr als 13'000 Franken pro Jahr, wie der Assetinum-Vergleich zeigt. Der Online-Handel bei der Credit Suisse ist denn auch bloss «Teil eines umfassenden Beratungs- und Dienstleistungspakets» und könne deshalb nicht mit reinen Online-Brokern verglichen werden, teilt die Grossbank mit. Ähnlich argumentieren andere Universalbanken mit hohen Online-Handelsgebühren.  
  
**Preis nicht einziges Kriterium**  
Tatsächlich sind [spezialisierte Online-Broker](http://www.assetinum.com/de/online-broker-vergleich-2011-resultate.html) zwar im Durchschnitt deutlich günstiger als [Universalbanken](http://www.assetinum.com/de/online-broker-vergleich-2011-universalbanken.html), bieten allerdings in der Regel keine Anlageberatung an und sind deshalb nur fortgeschrittenen Anlegern zu empfehlen. Für die Wahl eines Online-Brokers ist demnach nicht nur der Preis ausschlaggebend. Gerade für erfahrene Trader sind neben dem Preis überdies Faktoren wie Abwicklungsgeschwindigkeit, Realtime-Kurse, Nutzerfreundlichkeit, Produktvielfalt und Börsenzugänge entscheidend.  
  
**Unterschiedliche Börsentools**  
Auch Börsentools können für Anleger hilfreich sein: Der Marktführer Swissquote zum Beispiel verfügt über eine reichhaltige Palette an Hilfsinstrumenten inklusive Online-Vermögensverwaltungs-Tool. Wer mit dem Smartphone aktiv handeln möchte, kann dies mit den Mobile-Applikationen von Swissquote, Keytrade Bank oder Saxo Bank tun. Auf jeden Fall sollte der Anleger vor der Wahl des geeigneten Online-Brokers die Dienstleistungsangebote genau studieren. Dafür offeriert die Mehrheit der Online-Broker kostenlose Demoversionen zum Ausprobieren.

**Choosing a Forex Broker**  
  
**How to Choose a Forex Broker**  
  
By [John Russell](http://forextrading.about.com/bio/John-Russell-44005.htm), About.com Guide  
  
Choosing a forex broker can be daunting task. They all seem to sound so good when you read their sales pages, but how do you know which ones are worth your money?  
**Initial Deposit**  
  
You should look for a forex broker that has a low initial deposit. It is not a matter of the amount you should start trading with, but if a broker wants many thousands just for you to open an account, it is questionable. The ideal initial deposit requirements should be $300 to $500 or less. **Regulation**  
  
The forex market is an unregulated market meaning there is no central exchange. However, forex brokers themselves are regulated. In the US they should be registered as a Futures Commission Merchant (FCM) with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission(CTFC) and a member of the National Futures Association(NFA). You can verify a broker’s status with the NFA on the [NFA web site](http://www.nfa.futures.org/basicnet/). If you do not find the broker you are interested in listed with the NFA, look for another broker that is listed and has a clean record. **Customer Service**  
  
[Forex trading hours](http://forextrading.about.com/od/forexbasics/a/trading_times.htm) vary depending on what currencies you are most interested in trading. With that in mind, it is important to find a broker with 24 hour customer service. The forex markets can be wild at times. If you had a question about order execution or a closed order, you should be able to get your question answered no matter what time it is. A good test of a forex broker’s customer service ability is to contact the support desk and ask some questions by phone. Keep notes on how responsive they are to your questions and what attitude they have about answering them. Remember, you are trusting these people with your money. You need to feel absolutely comfortable that all your needs will be addressed.  
**Currency Pairs**  
  
Find a broker that offers the currency pairs that you are most interested in trading, or at least a good variety to choose from. Currency pairs tend to have different breathing patterns and you want to have a good menu of selections. **Software**  
  
A professional and easy to use [trading platform](http://forextrading.about.com/od/forexglossary/g/tradingplatform.htm) is a must. You would not want to be struggling with the features of the trading platform while trying to make a trade. Any reputable forex broker will offer the ability to trade on a [demo account](http://forextrading.about.com/od/gettingstarted/a/demoaccount.htm). The demo software operates the same way as the live trading platform. This will give you a chance to fully test out the trading platform without the pressure of using real money. **Reputation**  
  
Always check the reputation of a forex broker. One way is to do a google search with the name of the broker plus the word “complaints”. Check around and get opinions from traders on [forex message boards](http://forums.about.com/n/pfx/forum.aspx?nav=messages&webtag=ab-forextrading&lgnF=y). Spend a fair amount of time doing your research. This is an important relationship. You will want to be absolutely comfortable with the broker that you decide on. The important thing to remember is that you will have to do some homework here. It is imperative that you are not lazy about it. Don’t be sucked in by a glossy sales page with extraordinary claims. Investigate! Use a demo account. Take some time to shop around. In the end, you will be happy that you did.

**Test Your Forex Broker with a Demo Account**  
  
By: [Yohay Elam](http://www.investorguide.com/article/author/yelam/), dated January 15th, 2010 I’ve received a letter from a reader asking me to help him chose between two [forex brokers](http://www.investorguide.com/article/online-forex-trading-broker-comparison-guide/). Before getting into the details, I asked him if he had tested those brokers with a [forex demo account](http://www.investorguide.com/article/4043/when-should-you-switch-from-a-forex-demo-account-to-a-live-account/). I was surprised that he didn’t even consider it. This is very important: **you should always test a broker with a demo account.**  
About two months ago, I wrote about this issue in a post titled [_Forex Demo Account – A Must for Every Broker_](http://www.forexcrunch.com/forex-demo-account-a-must-for-every-broker/).

A forex demo account enables you to get to know the broker’s software before putting real money in. Who would want to lose money just because he missed an important button? Who would want to throw cash stupidly?  

My opinion regarding this method of testing hasn’t changed. It even got stronger.  
Three weeks ago, new regulations have been imposed on forex traders that work with American brokers. With the new [First In First Out](http://www.babypips.com/blogs/espipionage/new_nfa_rules.html) ([FIFO](http://www.investorguide.com/stock.php?ticker=FIFO)) rules by the [National Futures Association](http://www.nfa.futures.org/index.asp) ([NFA](http://www.investorguide.com/stock.php?ticker=NFA)), forex software now includes new restraints that are supposed to prevent the possibility of hedging. Some brokers have fully adapted to the new rules, some promised that they bypassed them elegantly while others just send you to their foreign subsidiaries. These [new NFA regulations are confusing](http://www.forexcrunch.com/new-nfa-regulations-confusion-is-growing/). Here’s a post about [dos and don’ts regarding the new NFA rules](http://www.forexcrunch.com/nfa-fifo-forex-regulations-dos-and-donts/).  
  
Forex trading takes time to learn, and is complicated enough before these new rules. When adding this new level of complexity (at least for American brokers), it’s very important to take the time and test your new broker before putting in real money.

****[Top 10 Tips For Choosing Reliable Forex Trade Brokers](http://beforexbroker.com/top-10-forex-broker-top-10-tips-for-choosing-reliable-forex-trade-brokers.html)****  
June 29, 2011 By [Terry Ladouceur](http://beforexbroker.com/author/Terry%20Ladouceur)  
  
Recently, more and more people are looking towards trading as a form of investment as well as a form of business. Forex Trading or Currency trading is fast becoming one of the most popular forms of investment trading today.  
And with minimum start up capital required, the barriers to entry are fairly low and this has made it easier for the man in the street to start trading the Forex market.  
However, unless you are a bank or large financial institution, you will require the services of a broker to be able to trade currencies.  
Luckily, with an increase in the demand for FX Trading, there is a corresponding increase in the number of Forex brokers in the market.  
However, with so many brokers to choose from, the problem facing most potential Forex traders is not how to trade but how to select a reliable broker to begin trading with.  
Unfortunately, not all brokers in the market are the same. You will need to find a suitable broker that caters to your specific needs as a trader.  
And from experience, this could be prove to be the tricky part as not all brokers offer the same services or have the same charges and policies. Slight differences in charges such as the pip spread will have a large impact on your profits' bottom line.  
Seriously, if you wish to make a living as a Forex trader, you need to focus on the markets and not have to worry about questionable brokers. Therefore, choosing a reliable Forex currency trading broker should be one of the top priorities you need to do before you even start trading.  
There are actually several factors that make a foreign exchange broker a good one, and here's my top 10 tips for choosing good currency trading brokers.  
  
1\. Reputation  
Reputation is important in this business as there are quite a number of "fly-by-night" operations out there in the market. Basically, the rule of thumb is to stick with the more established Forex currency trading brokers who have a good track record.  
An important factor to note is that all of their business dealings must be verifiable. Do they have a legitimate office with many satisfied customers? Have they been in business for many years or did they just pop up overnight?  
You can find out a great deal of information from unbiased review websites that talk about their experiences with brokers. If someone got ripped off before, you should probably steer clear.  
Dependable brokers should be transparent in their dealings and operations. Relevant information about how they function must be readily available online so that potential traders can easily find out more about their reputation as well as performance.  
  
2\. Regulations  
No matter which country you live in, always choose a Forex broker that is conducting business in a country where their activities are monitored by a regulatory authority. A reliable Forex broker must be regulated and accountable to the relevant authorities.  
For example, the Swiss banking system is one of the most tightly-run ships in the world regulated by the Swiss Federal Department Of Finance, while US Forex trade brokers should be official members of the National Futures Association (NFA) and registered as a Futures Commission Merchant (FCM) with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).  
In other words, they must adhere and conform to industry rules and regulations. The last thing you want is some unregulated broker in the middle of nowhere holding onto your money. If they go under, good luck ever getting your money back.  
If a broker is not regulated by any monetary authority, it might be better to select another broker instead.  
  
3\. Differences In Pip Spread  
Unlike stock brokers, currency trading brokers don't charge a fee or commission, instead they make their commission from the difference in the pip spread of the currency pair when you trade.  
Unlike other financial markets, the currency market is not traded through a central exchange, the value of this spread is thus determined by the broker you are using instead.  
Most Forex brokers publish live or delayed prices on their websites so that traders can compare spread differences and some brokers even offer a variable pip spread.  
At first glance, the concept of a variable spread may appear tempting because of the volatility of the Forex Market. When the market is quiet, the spread is relatively small, but when the market really heats up, the spread difference might just widen large enough to wipe out your profits.  
Unfortunately, many brokers out there are referred to as "bucket shops". They don't have your best interest in mind and some have been known to change the [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") around to their advantage.  
The bottom line here is still to look for FX brokers with fixed and low pip spreads regardless of how the market moves.  
  
4\. Speed Of Execution  
In my book, this is something most novice traders seldom notice when they sign up for a trading account.  
Most brokers do publish live prices on their trading platform but the question here is how fast are they able to execute the order once you click the "Buy" or "Sell" button.  
Speed of execution of the order is imperative especially if you are a scalper trading the 5 minute charts, can't possibly sit around waiting another 5 minutes just for the order to confirm right?  
Luckily, the best solution to this problem is to open a demo account with the broker and given them a test drive. This will allow you to test trial their trading platform's speed of execution.  
  
5\. Minimum Trading Account Size  
Nowadays, broker leverages are getting higher and higher to cater for the small retail trader who have limited capital but wants a piece of the Forex action.  
  
****Top 10 Forex Broker-Top 10 Tips For Choosing Reliable Forex Trade Brokers****  
  
Micro and Nano accounts are available but most brokers offer the 2 standard types of trading account sizes, namely the Standard and Mini account.  
There key difference between a Standard and Mini account is that a Standard account trades in 100,000 units, while a mini account trades only a tenth of that size, or 10,000 units per lot.  
In other words the mini account deals in one tenth the size of the regular account. This allows you to risk a tenth of what you would be risking in the regular account.  
  
6\. Margin & Leverage  
Margin accounts constitutes the basis framework of Forex trading, so make sure you are fully aware the broker's margin terms before rushing to open a live trading account, the last thing you want to hear is a margin call from your broker.  
Make sure you are fully aware of how your broker calculates the margin requirements and does it change according to the currency pair traded? Is it fixed or variable at different times of the day or week?  
Do take note that some brokers offer different margin requirements for Standard and Mini accounts, so beware.  
And when it comes to leverage, most traders are familiar with the 1:100 ratio, but are did you know that some currency trading brokers today even offer leverages of up to 1:400.  
A word of caution if you are a novice trader, don't use too much leverage as this is one of the key reasons so many newbie traders get wiped out so fast. Remember, the key to winning the Forex game is to compound small and consistent profits.  
  
7\. Rollover Rates  
Rollover rates are charges that are incurred when traders move their positions to the following trading day.  
If you are a scalper or a day trader, this rate might not affect your trading account but if you are a swing trader or a long term trader, this seemingly small figure might sometimes snowball if you are not aware.  
That is why it is important to find out the minimum margin requirements to earn on an over-night position? Is it a mere 0.5% or a staggering 2%, go do the math.  
  
8\. Trading Platform  
A good trading platform should not only show real live prices that allows traders to "Buy" or "Sell", but also a host of other features like charting and technical analysis tools.  
Some platforms even offer more advanced functions like trailing stops, mobile trading and even the use of automated trading softwares called expert advisers.  
Most brokers will have their own proprietary trading platform but many are using the Metatrader 4 platform as it is a fairly easy to use system that can cater to all levels of traders ranging from novices to experts.  
In my book, the type of trading platform used can either make trading the Forex market a breeze or a real hassle, so make sure you get a feel of the platform by signing up for a demo account.  
  
9\. Technical Support  
Typically, the type of support comes in the form of telephony or email support, and even "Live Chat" in some cases.  
Since the Forex market is a global 24 hours market, likewise the corresponding support provided by the broker should be 24 hours around the clock as well.  
Remember, it might be 3pm in the afternoon for you, but it could also be 3am in the morning for another trader across the globe, so ensure that there will be someone from the broker's office to pick up the call if something goes wrong.  
A essential aspect of support that must be high-lited is the ability to close an "open" position over the telephone in the unfortunate event that your PC stalls or the internet connection fails, beware, anything can happen if Murphy's Law kicks in.  
  
10\. Additional Value Added Services  
Most of the better Forex trade brokers offer great value added services in terms of free webinars, technical tools, e-books, articles and even daily market analysis and updates from their own panel of in house consultants.  
This might just come in handy if you are the type of trader who trades fundamentals.  
Well, that's my 2 cents worth when it comes to finding reliable Forex trade brokers, hope it provides you sufficient information for a good head start in all your Forex trading ventures.

How to Choose a Forex Broker  
  
With so many different choices out there, how does a Forex "newbie" pick a broker? Chances are most new traders have no idea on where to start - and that's okay! We're here to help! We have put together a simple three step process to help you find a broker that YOU think will best suit YOUR needs. You might be thinking now, "Three steps? That's it?" Yesssiirrrr!   
In the first step, you will go through some of the main questions you need ask yourself when reviewing different brokers. Then you will take a look at different brokers and their available features. We have put together a comparison guide by taking some of the most frequently asked questions across the internet, and surveyed some of the most frequently asked about brokers out there, so that you don't have to.   
With this guide, you can narrow your choices down and take the final step of talking with different brokers and demo trading on different platforms. Simple, right? Let's begin...  
  
**Step 1: Do your research**  
  
Before comparing brokers, do you know what to look for? No? Well, here are a few of the main questions you should ask yourself: 

  1. Is this broker registered with any regulating authorities? Check to see if your broker of choice is registered with the National Futures Association (NFA) or Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) if they're based in the US. If the broker is based in the United Kingdom, check with the Financial Service Authority (FSA). If the broker isn't registered with any of these or any other recognized regulating firm, then you may want to think twice before signing up with them.
  2. Dealing Desk or Non-Dealing Desk broker? Does the broker offer fixed or non-fixed spreads? How wide are the spreads? These questions are more significant to those traders who like to take quick profits on a few pips. Large and/or variable spreads can cut into the profits of this type of trading strategy.
  3. How much or how little leverage will a broker give you? We highly recommend you review "[Leverage the Killer](http://www.babypips.com/school/leverage_the_killer.html)"before deciding on how much leverage would be suitable for your trading style. The phrase, "Less is More," can save every newbie
  4. Of course, you’re not going to start trading with real money right away, right? Well, when you do having a winning strategy and you are ready to trade live; knowing how much risk capital you have to start with makes a big difference. If you have $2000 or less to start with then you probably want to start trading "micro" lots. Not every broker has this feature.
  5. Does this broker credit or debit daily rollover interest? Some brokers either do both, deduct interest, or neither. This information is important to traders who hold positions overnight.
  6. Does this broker over premium services such as charting, news feeds, and market commentary? How important are premium services to my trading?

**Step 2: Compare brokers**  
  
Let's not beat around the bush, now you need go to [Broker Comparison Guide](http://www.babypips.com/tools/forex-brokers-guide/compare.php).   
  
**Step 3: Open demo accounts and ask questions.**  
  
Pick at least two brokers that fits most of your criteria and open up demo accounts. Trade in different market environments. Learn all the different features of each trading platform. If you have questions, don't be afraid to ask. Many brokers have excellent customer service support and would be happy to answer your questions.   
Most demo trading platforms are very similar to their live counterparts, but not exactly the same. There may be a difference in speed of execution, slippage, and platform reliability (most of the time live accounts are more reliable than demo accounts). When you do have your strategy down and you are ready to move to a live account, start off small, test the waters, and see if this particular broker will suit your trading needs.

Most overrated?  
Before the currency market will open the doors I take a look at different currency pairs and at different time-frames over week-end and make up my mind at which time frames could be a probability to make a real profit in this week - exclusively by using the CCI Indicator for a first spacial orientation by following its rhythm of the visual waves,....and there is also a fact of the Pivotal Points, see the examples below, please.

There could be executed good winning trades around some CCI-Top-&-Bottom-Levels.  
But don't be blind when walking into a room! (to go into the market).  
Make a Multiple-Time-Frame-Analysis before!   
It makes no sense to trade e.g. an H4 down when the daily and weekly chart is located into a strong upside movement.

**[Forex Strategy Trend Line + CCI Divergence](http://strategy4forex.com/strategies-based-on-forex-indicators/trend-line-cci-divergence.html)**  
Published: 31.03.2010  
  
**Forex Strategy Trend Line + CCI Divergence** \- as we know, almost all professional traders in financial markets often use the Divergence of different indicators to decide on the conclusion of a transaction, so we are now and consider a very simple but very effective strategy for forex, which is based on _Divergence indicator CCI_ , predicting about trend reversal (or temporary roll back) prices in the forex market in the near future.

  1. To trade forex recommend choosing [**Forex Brokers with Metatrader 4**](http://strategy4forex.com/files/brokers.html)

This strategy works well on any interval, but it is desirable to use the above M15.  
On the schedule for the chosen currency pair (which may be the same - any) set MT4 indicator - FX Sniper’s CCI (14)  
First of all, let’s see what we assume the **divergence indicator CCI **in this strategy.  
  
Examples of divergence CCI look at the figures:  
  
[http://strategy4forex.com/wp-content...3/diver_01.jpg](http://strategy4forex.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/diver_01.jpg)   
**  
Divergence** \- is tence other than the _price difference on the chart and the indicator CCI_. If the price on the chart makes successive highs, and the indicator shows a successive minima - this is the **divergence of CCI**.  
Similarly, if the price on the chart makes the successive minima, and the CCI indicator we see successive peaks - this is also the divergence of CCI.  
Now let’s consider the conditions under which we will enter the market under the rules of forex **strategy CCI Divergence + Trandeline**.  
  
**We conclude deals for:**  
1\. Determine the trend and note that the _trend is down at our chosen time-frame _(the price makes successive minima)  
2\. We are witnessing the divergence of CCI at our chosen time-frame.  
  
[http://strategy4forex.com/wp-content...03/diver02.jpg](http://strategy4forex.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/diver02.jpg)  
  
3\. In the second extreme of CCI closed for at least 1-2 bars after the formation of divergence.  
4\. Building a trendline from the maxima of the price movement downward in the interval of divergence.  
5\. Price closes above the trend line downward, constructed from the maxima points, located the interval under consideration divergence.  
6\. We conclude the **deal on the opening price the next bar after the penetration of the trend line**.  
7\. **Stop-loss** is placed below the local minimum in the near or under the candles to penetrate the trend line (if it is at least 50-70 points).  
8\. At a distance equal to the size of stop-loss position in translating bezubytok and close 1 / 2 a position.  
9\. **Forward the remaining 1 / 2 trading position on the trailing stop** (trailing size depends on the chosen currency pair and time-frame in which you trade, but about its value must be equal to the initial stop-loss).  
**Note:** if, after construction of the trend line, you saw a new divergence or surprisingly a later peak at the indicator CCI - should redraw the trendline and the follow items 3-6 (above) or remove it!

During the breakdown of the trend line 3rd divergence, if desired, stop-loss order can be placed not under the local minimum and a candle to penetrate the trend line. The 1 / 2 of the transaction would have closed with a profit, and the rest position closed on “zero”.

Using Convergence and Divergence and CCI in Forex Trading   
By Sam Evans  
  
The concept of understanding convergence and divergence in technical analysis was one of the very first subjects I was taught in the Online Trading Academy classroom when I was a student, and to be honest, I found it a little confusing in the early stages. I was probably just going through a similar challenge that many novice traders are faced with in the early stages of their education, namely an overload of information and new ideas. This is common, so don't think you are alone if you’re currently faced with the same prospects.   
As an instructor in the Online Trading Academy classroom and ongoing Extended Learning Track (XLT) environment, I tell my students that it will always serve them well to start their trading career with a simple and methodical approach, because this will give them the very best chance to gain consistency in their speculation and analysis. As they begin to master the core skills of risk management and objective analysis, they can then start to add a few extra tools to their arsenal to enhance their performance, and if used correctly, implementing convergence and divergence analysis into the trading plan can be of great use over time.  
Typically, traditional methods of technical analysis use the Moving Average Convergence Divergence, or MACD, indicator for this technique, and while I would agree that this is one way of carrying out the study, it can be done with other indicators as well. This week, I will focus on using one of my preferred analysis tools, the Commodity Channel Index, or CCI, to carry out objective convergence and divergence analysis in conjunction with a solid understanding of supply and demand. But let's first come to grips with the terminology itself.  
Convergence is described as when price action is generally following the same path as what we are seeing on our technical indicator. So, for example, in an uptrend where the market is making higher highs and higher lows, we would also be seeing signs of strength in our technical indicator of choice. This is a sign of continuing momentum in price and would suggest that a trend has a higher probability of continuation. The same would be said for a downtrend, but the market would be making lower lows and lower highs with weakness showing on the indicator, giving the trader clues that there is still momentum in the downside moves. Basically, price and the indicator are doing the same thing, or converging.  
Divergence is described as when price action is not following the same path as what we are seeing on our technical indicator. In an uptrend of higher highs and higher lows, we would now be seeing weakness in our technical indicator of choice. This is now a sign that momentum is beginning to decrease, suggesting that the trend has a higher probability of reversing. Likewise, we would look for the opposite signals in a downtrend, where the price action would be showing lower lows and lower highs, but the indicator would instead be giving us signs of strength, suggesting the possibility of waning momentum and an upcoming move to the upside. To summarize, price and the indicator are doing the opposite thing, or diverging.  
So, with this is mind, we can conclude that:  
Convergence = Higher Momentum = Possible Trend Continuation  
Divergence = Lower Momentum = Possible Trend Reversal  
As I stated before, the traditional measure of convergence and divergence has been the MACD indicator, but if we understand the concept itself, we can substitute this tool for another and get the same results. Which one is right? The simple answer is whatever you prefer. It is the use of the indicator and the analysis itself that will ultimately define the results for the individual trader. For this example, I will use the Commodity Channel Index (CCI) for the study. The definition of the CCI is that it is a measure of market or price strength. It gives us signs of overbought and oversold conditions in price action. Developed by Donald Lambert, the CCI calculates the distance between a price and its average over a set period of time. The default settings are usually 14 or 20 periods (depending on your charting platform and personal choice), and obviously, this can be adjusted like any other technical indicator. I like to interpret the CCI as a speedometer of the market, making it an ideal measure of momentum in prices. And perfect for my convergence and divergence analysis.   
With this in mind, let's now put these ideas into practice by combining the CCI with some convergence/divergence analysis on a recent example of price activity on the USD/CAD currency pair.  
  

[](http://www.moneyshow.com/trading/Currency_Corner.asp?aid=currency-19469&iid=currency&page=2#)[http://graphics.moneyshow.com/trader...41410/Fig1.gif](http://graphics.moneyshow.com/traders/currency/041410/Fig1.gif)

On this four-hour chart of USD/CAD, I have marked off three key pivots marked as A, B, and C, and applied the CCI indicator with a setting of 20 periods. In these examples, I would like to state that we are not focusing our attention on the overbought and oversold buy and sell signals the CCI is generating, but rather using the CCI to measure momentum in the price moves. Notice how between point A and point B, we saw a downward trend in price, with lower lows and lower highs? At the same time this was happening, we also saw a weakness in the CCI, with it too making lower lows and lower highs as marked by the blue circles. Since both indicator and price were doing the same thing, we can assume there is still momentum in the downtrend, or convergence. Upon reaching point B on the chart, we then began to see buying pressure enter the market and the USD/CAD then reversed into an uptrend.   
What were the signals of this upcoming change in direction? Well, we can see that the CCI began to put in higher highs and higher lows between March 17 and 19, suggesting that downside momentum was drying up, or creating divergence. For the next few days, the currency pair enjoyed a decent upside move with higher highs and higher lows, while the CCI exhibited similar traits as well, presenting us with convergence once again, or momentum. However, it should also be noted that between the March 25 and 29, on the approach to pivot C, while the price was still moving up, our CCI was making lower lows and lower highs, as marked again by the blue circles on the chart. Strength in price and weakness in the indicator suggests dying momentum in the trend, or divergence. Could this be a sign that the upward trend is coming to an end? Let's see how things turned out:  
  

[](http://www.moneyshow.com/trading/Currency_Corner.asp?aid=currency-19469&iid=currency&page=2#)[http://graphics.moneyshow.com/trader...41410/Fig2.gif](http://graphics.moneyshow.com/traders/currency/041410/Fig2.gif)  
Figure 2 - Click to Enlarge

  
Momentum did indeed subside, and upon reaching the 1.0300 level, the USD/CAD fell to just below parity with the US dollar putting in a low of 0.9975. This move was also complemented by convergence with the CCI also giving signs of weakness, as highlighted on the above example. Once again, however, as the pair was approaching the 1.000 level, the CCI showed us subtle signs of strength by putting in a higher low and diverging away from price before the bounce we can see happened at 1.000, to at the time of writing this article, 1.0073.  
I am sure you will agree that a simple and logical understanding of how convergence and divergence shows itself on a price chart can be a powerful weapon in the hands of the disciplined trader, but it must be stated that these techniques are nowhere near good enough to base trading decisions upon alone. Any technical indicator should only be used as an analytical tool, not a decision maker for a taking a trade. As you can see from the above example, even without using any kind of convergence/divergence analysis, there was a low-risk, high-probability trading opportunity to short USD/CAD at 1.0300 anyway, simply because price rallied into an objective area of supply, or resistance, within the context of a bigger downward trend. Price alone is the only thing a trader will ever need as an analysis tool, but it can do you no harm at all to add something a little extra from time to time to increase the overall probability for success. I hope this helped.

FC, sometimes I'll try something like that, and end up getting in to early.  
I see the hidden divergence, but... how do you know the 100 CCI level is it...  
  
What else do you look at that tells to to call a short position?

Hello Carl!  
It isn't the 100CCI-Level. It could be further more upside.  
Thoughts in terms of probabilities.  
Often I look at H1, M30, M15 and then at M5 and M1. H1 candles are forming a long shadow at the moment and these H1 candles are overlapping each other, I also know that London Market is closed. So I see a good chance over the actual Price Action of H1 and particularly at M15 (overlay) to trade some M1 Orders in this way and only for several pips just now. The market has make an abrupt movement till DPV 1.3525 and I don't expect a second sudden movement right now. Not just yet! And so I trade the M5 actual like in the frame below. Here it could be a CCI-Value under 100 (CCI < 100) and it could give an adequate signal for a Short Order.

M5 could be go further down (mS1 1.3481). If so maybe the Price Action could mold a divergence.

hi forexcube  
  
I always follow the threads  
  
I know the CCI14 and I really like ... possibly the best forex indicator  
  
I tried the strategy m1 ... works very well  
  
I wanted to know how much was lost once the ICC reaches the area of 100 or -100 because I very easily around 5 pips ... I finally got a few minutes ago out in loss (in the last two operations left when I arrived at -100 CCI)  
  
grand strategy requires only training ... one or two hours a day.  
  
thanks friend ... I keep reading it

Hi porfirio  
  
I go in the market with one-tenth at first and added one-tenth more if the CCI will go further in the contrary direction if the higher timeframes gives me signals for a reverse.   
  
Multiple Time Fame Analyse:   
I also switch at M5, M15 and H1 and take a look at H4 (is there any Ranges) to make up my analysis for M1 trading. This way goes right well for me!  
  
MM:  
Maybe you have to adapt your Money Management to your CCI Strategy a little more when trading solely the M1. It could be also a difference if you will wait till the top CCI is build or not. I tend to go often a little earlier in the market and don't wait every time if the CCI has shaped the apex or not and I don't wait for my e.g. shorts if the CCI indicator are crossing the 100 line downwards. Often I am in the short before and when CCI will crossing the 100 Level I go in the market with one short more. So I let several (1/10) orders running in the market and accept the market its breath.  
  
Be aware:  
If you trade M1 the whole day long equal upon what strategy soever you could loose all the money!   
  
Preferred market situation for M1 Trading:  
I like to trade M1 near the pivotal points when higher time frames are signalizing a turn around or in ranging market...and I never trade M1 before I have make a Multiple Time Frame Analysis (Candle Sticks Pattern and so on).  
  
Maybe you could upload a M1, M5, M15, M30, H1 and H4 chart of your M1-Loss here at board, so I can give you a more qualified answer of your question, please!  
  
Hope it helps!  
Best wishes from Switzerland!  
FXcube

GBPCHF  
One argument is the H4 Divergence (+) another a Daily CCI Bottom (+) with a Weekly Range (+) but be aware that the Weekly has formed a neg. Divergence (-) with a Monthly Top (-) but the Monthly then again have room to the top (+).

HI crodzilla  
  
The truth is that I only look at the different TF CCI and shape of the candles.

Thanks, I'll watch your trades here to.

Yes it's okay. So you could wait! Why not?  
I post here and there my market view. Everybody has his own one.   
I trade with one-tenth. So I can go in and out of the market at different price levels.  
Kindest regards

I already know it is not strictly speaking a pinbar  
  
but the wicks (shadows), I suggest that buyers are losing strength in this moment  
this is not an exact science

Oh yes, sure, but this answer needs more time and I will answer your question in the next time, please, when I have more time and could make some examples.   
  
Before long  
I trade with one-tenth of my normal entry capacity per trade. So I can go in and out of the market at different price levels and I don't need to make a strong Stop Loss and give the market its breath. Viewed in this light imagine that behind all my published trades in this thread could be several entry and exit orders at different time levels more and this goes extremely fast at M1 trading, when market gets choppy.  
  
If I make these examples I need minimum 30 minutes with all these charts and frames for a clearer understanding and I have to give 15 or 30 examples to bail out different time charts and different market environment (maybe also different currency pairs).  
  
Notice, please that this kind of MM is adapt at my way of CCI-Trading with my way to take different risk over at different market situations.   
  
You have then to put out all these ideas which could benefit your trading style and fits your life of trading.  
  
Kindest regards  
FXcube

I wish to do many compliments to the thread starter, Forexcube, not only for his trading performance, but for his patience too in posting all that "CCI-related stuff".  
  
I can't really follow your trading methodology, but i guess that time will help ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
This topic is a big resource, keep it up Forexcube and thank you!

Hi Porfirio, really an impressive performance! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Can you please post a chart with those trades on, and the today's trades too?   
You do it by dragging the lines in the history tab onto a chart.  
  
I'm just courious, your trade performance is really good!   
What is your MM, same as FXCube? You don't use stops?  
  
Thanks in advance!

If you read the whole thread you will see that I started the day 21 at 13:08 p.m.  
  
I have only been three days ... if I put a reporter strategies appear operations that have nothing to do with these.  
  
CCI works, just have to practice ... if I put my record is to give witness forexcube has always said about the CCI (not just in this thread)

Hi landsat  
  
Below you will see the first Example Module (Life).  
See #[**224**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5162060#post5162060) \- #[**229**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5162074#post5162074), please  
  
I will work out a *pdf-file in the next weeks to give more background information of my decisions.  
I don't like to trade towards hard rules, I preferre the framework conditions, more the basic conditions, the underlying circumstances which could explain why 1/10 or better 4/10, or up to 10/10? ...more short or more longer term trades?, ... and so on.  
  
Kindest regards  
FXcube

Third Step  
MM Example Module 1  
Third Step - Decision Making  
  
Before I have seen the Weekly and the Daily I would go in the market with 2/10, maybe 3/10. But the higher time frames could focus a higher risk. Apart from that all shorter time frames looks stable and consistent. So minimum 1/10 should be worth the risk for this entry order for me.  
  
Putting all together and make a choice.  
  
Okay I take the risk over with a Long 1/10 (1st Long Order) at first and will set a Stop Loss below the Support Line of M30.  
  
If the market price will go up then I take at H1 or at H4 Level the next entry Long (2nd Long Order) with 1/10 and trail the Stop (1st Long Order) upside over 5 points in the net earnings area.  
  
NZDUSD, M30/H1/H4, 2011 November 24  
Long @ 0.73996

(post 226) has the swing point lines I am looking for. The pivots indy does not add that feature. I have a similar indy that plots the close of the candles, but I am looking for this one that plots the wicks. I think it is a separate indy not posted here.   
  
And yes, I have all the options turned true in the pivots indy. It does not have the option for swing point horizontal lines.

hi dig  
  
I told you yesterday as the indicator is the 123patV6  
  
playing with the settings ... from false to true  
  
  
BUT  
Focus more on the progression you just explain forexcube on ITC because that is what to do ... TF go down to find a good entry

I will work out a *pdf-file in the next weeks to give more background information of my decisions.  
I don't like to trade towards hard rules, I preferre the framework conditions, more the basic conditions, the underlying circumstances which could explain why 1/10 or better 4/10, or up to 10/10? ...more short or more longer term trades?, ... and so on.

I dunno what Porforio do in those conditions, but generally speaking, for the "continuation divergences" (so not a spike, topping/bottoming one) it's better to simply re-enter at the brake of the +/-100 level.  
Just mind that, in that particular trade, you're heavily counter-trend, and the "daily range" has been broken, so _generally speaking_ that's not a really good trade, you may want to adjust your stop or scale down your lots, or something like that..

hi oly1  
sorry can not read before ... had to leave  
  
I see a difference .... have to relate your entry with the CCI of higher TF (h1-m15-m1-m5)  
see also the wicks of the candles .... see if the sellers are losing strength in different tf  
  
read all forexcube post .... clearly explains  
  
\------  
  
gold hi ... thank you very much ... then look at the indicator

hey porfirio.....  
  
i understand what Forexcube mentioned.  
  
but i did not understand how you combine Triangle MA indicator with his system ?  
  
i mean look at my previous image. i had a overbought position in cci. and the triangle ma shows a buy signal.  
  
i went long. but suddenly it dropped about 40 pips. what's wrong i did there ?  
Yes there were no perfect divergence in cci.  
  
it would be better if you could show a image with your entry exit system as like as forexcube posted.  
  
here is what i made by Forexcube today.  
<http://i.imgur.com/OE7st.gif>   
  
i am trying divergence with bollinger bands.  
  
thanks

porfirio was right.  
The horizontal lines drawn at the wicks in [#226](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5162069#post5162069) you are calling 'swing points'  
are drawn by the 123 indy.

Thanks Forexcube for all you are posting to this thread.  
The reading material/resources are a nice collection on   
the importance of divergence..... you use them like a MASTER...  
fun to watch you scalp in countertrend only to then pivot  
and ride it back down the other way.... like watching a surfer  
riding UP the waves and gliding back down.  
  
I read/reread the 16 pages so far and would draw some attention  
back to [this post](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5149829#post5149829).  
I downloaded and put that **CCI Divergence indy** onto a chart  
and flipped through the tf's watching it draw/redraw.  
It's quite good ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
at (attempting) to draw both 'hidden' divergence (dashed) aka continuation  
and true divergence (solid) alerting to possible reversals.  
  
After a quick study.... the indy seems to be 'better' alerting 'true' divergence than hidden... but  
the dashed/'hidden' signals are drawn nonetheless so you can analyze them in the different tfs.  
Sometimes they're exactly right... and would help you to 'hold' trades  
Sometimes they're in conflict with a simultaneous 'true' divergence signal  
developing at the same time (though NOT drawn!!)  
I would like to get better at recognizing them (i.e. hidden divergence)  
and when/whether to 'ignore' them.  
  
**Questions:**  
Any advice as to when you have 'conflicting' (both) signals developing at the same time?  
also:  
I'm not sure how 'fast' this indy draws in Real Time (or whether it 'redraws'/deletes).  
I'd be interested to know your thoughts/experience with this indy.  
Thanks ahead and keep this thread going!!!!  
Cheers,  
G.

Hello  
  
thank you forexcube for sharing this nice system.  
I'm still learning to filter the good cci signals... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
And one question at profirio:  
In the picture in post 241 for example, there is a grey indicator with dotted lines in the background. Which indi is it and maybe can you share it? It gives a good visual aid of the current movement. (furthermore only1kader uses a slightly different indicator in post 245. I think it's tmatrue, but I'm not sure)  
  
Thanks and keep posting

Hi Forexcube  
  
A big thank you for gathering and sharing information on the CCI.  
  
Really appriciate your time in posting your live trades, the entry price, the target price and the different position size.   
  
  
I would like to ask when you would enter the market with a full position (or even double the positon size) - i.e. what setup (or combination of signals) you consider a A1 golden signal from the CCI that is worth its weight in gold!? And why? (So sorry if I am asking for too much)  
  
  
Many Thanks.

See #[**261**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5164960#post5164960)   
  
Hi laimonk  
I don't trust the EURUSD currency pair in these months, so I would go in this market just with the maximum of 5/10 and this exclusively at M1/M5, not more. EURUSD has changed at the Forex Market like a casino-chip as well as the total european politics equally. With fundamental standards the EUR and the US-Dollar isn't worth 2 cents anymore. Would you buy active bonds from these countries where there financial things suffocate under the highest debts, which the world has ever seen and you could see no way to turn out of this one-way road? Not am I.  
  
4/10-10/10  
With the other currency pairs I would wait with 2/10 at higher time frames when the daily and the weekly and the monthly could have reached a CCI(14) Top or Bottom Level and would go in the market at H1 and H4 one-tenth each additively and with 3/10 - 5/10 at M1 and M5 in the main direction.  
  
CHF and JPY seems jammed (to be hemmed in) in these months, so also offer not the best chance for trading.  
  
When making a market analysis it's better to pick out these currency pairs and these time frames with a regularity of oscillations (waves) nowadays, maybe here you could go in with a higher risk tolerance.   
  
I will give you an example in Life when I trade orders with 5/10 - 10/10 or 20/10. Promise!

No doubt! When the CCI(14) will be located at the Top or Bottom at all time frames (and sometimes without the monthly)!

MM Example Module 2  
  
Let's talk about MM a little more.  
I have open a 10'000.-$ Demo Account (<http://www.forexfactory.com/forexcube>) to point out my way of trading in a clear way. 10K is great because you can go in with 0.01, 0,1, 1.0 Lot sizes or a multiple of them and so it's easy to calculate.  
In the frame below you could see some trades today <http://www.forexfactory.com/forexcube#50-list>  
  
(My) 1st goal:  
My target is make 1% a day with several 0.1% trades. With a 10'000.-$ Account I have to earn 100.-$ a Day net. If I would make 10 times a 0.1 Lot trade then I would have earned 1% profit of the deposits from 10'000.-$ (100.-$). See the closed trades e.g. 2-5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13-18 and 20. all these trades has make ~0.1% These trades were traded before or during the Asian Session. My target was making trade around 10.-$ per trade (0.1%) or half of it. All these were executed in mini lots of 0.1.  
  
(My) 2nd goal:  
My second target seems for me more important. When I see a market situation with a higher probability of making a profit (e.g. #[**266**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5165291#post5165291)) then I go in the market with a higher risk tolerance, say with several 0.1 lot trades and/or with 1 x 0.5 lot sizes and/or 2 x 0.2 lot sizes and/or 2-5 x 0.1 lot sizes, something like that (compare the closed order no.6 with 0.5 lot, please). Some of these trades I like to run a little longer and others I put out of the market earlier.   
I like this trading notably by trading different timeframes. I could go in a M5-CCI(14)-pos.divergence-market-situation Long and go out with the first orders at the next M1-CCI(14)-Top-Level by switching down the time frame (suddenly) at M1, ...and let the other open Long orders running further upside in the profit till the M5-CCI(14) has reached the middle line and/or the Top-Level (100>).  
  
Trading Style  
I connect my CCI(14)-Indicator and the Multiple-Time-Frame-Analysis (MTFA) with my personal risk tolerance. So it's not a rule engraved in stone, which everybody could simply copy but everybody could learn this technique and can adapt this great idea in his preferred way. May be someone don't like to go in a trade with a 0.5 lot size at M1/M5 Level with a 10K Account due to the fact that he like to trade more conservative. It's okay! He can go in with smaller lot sizes (maybe 0.02 or so). We all get our jollies one way or another.  
  
Risk & Trading Style  
Every trader has the job to work out his risk tolerance where he think he can make the most profit in close contact with his trading system.  
  
(Module 3 could tell something about the subject "how to cut the losses?" or "how to manage the minus trades?").   
  
See you next time!  
  
Kindest regards

Thank you mate, it makes totally sense.  
The only thing that i'm in doubt is the stop loss: for you, when is the moment to close a trade?

"I will give you an example in Life when I trade orders with 5/10 - 10/10 or 20/10. Promise!"  
  
  
Hi Forexcube  
  
Thank you for your promise to show a life example - I have alot to learn from you.   
  
  
I first looked at the CCI at "Woodie" website when he was trading the 3min than the 5min charts - some years ago. Somehow after about a year of trying, I could not generate consistant results, and moved on.  
  
Correct me if I am wrong, but trading the divergence is equal to "bottom fishing" - While some can make this art a profitable way of trading, many get slaughtered. So, having solid filters for counter trend trades is a must. If you would, could you please share some of your golden rules when taking divergences, it would greatly be appreciated!!!  
  
On another note, most of your examples show counter trend trades (sorry if I missed anything). Do you use the CCI for "with trend trades"??   
  
Once again, many thanks.

Alot of good trades today with the "CCI Div+BB" method on the 1m.  
As far as i can see (and logically speaking) is best used in sideways periods, special attention si needed in trends and breakout moments.  
  
Other people's experiences?

See #[**275**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5167666#post5167666)  
  
  
Hi only1kader  
  
What time frame is it? I suppose it's M5. For the next time I beg you to indicate the timeframe, please. The basic problem could be that this bearish divergence appears after a downtrend. It's basically even better you familiarize to trade the bearish divergences after an uptrend. The market environment at your chart looks more that is was a downtrend ongoing a consolidation phase and then the market compose oneself in an uptrend what we didn't know before it happens. So in this market environment it's more important to look at higher time frames also and incorporate (flow) in your decisions. If you have time maybe you could upload the corresponding M15, M30, H1 and H4 charts here at board and I could give you my mind about this vital market situation elementary.  
If you have tend to trade this consolidation phase (the range) then it would be okay. Why not! Okay it was a Loss, but you have to set a stop loss above.  
If I would trade this market situation I was gone Short with 1/10, so also at 1.3281 (mS2)(1/10) and at 1.3302 (DS1)(1/10) but at mS2 at the latest I would have made a Multiple Time Frame Analysis and would have take into my considerations.  
A good guidance could sometimes be to look how long the daily candles is shaped by then.  
  
...and be aware it was a (crazy) friday.  
  
...and the most important argument would be for me that the CCI(14) Indicator didn't show a divergence at Point (B), so also nothing to trade!  
The chart is signalizing at (A) and (C) a CCI(14) Divergence, but not at (B)!  
  
Kindest regards

Hi SteMag  
For me it depends at my risk tolerance and my deposits and my Profits which I have make before but the most important parameter is for me at which time frame I go with the Order in the market and with how much lot sizes. If I trade 1/10 I let often run the order two times or four times over the normal stop loss level which you could read in the forex literature here and there. 90-98% of all these trades are coming back in the win zone sooner or later and the remaining 2-10% I take it over into my "Loss Order Management" (say I often will hedge these losses with more lots and if I could do so also at smaller time frames and try to counterbalance these losses, so that at the end I tend to close these orders with a little plus). So I try to compensate the loss orders with win orders which I label "Loss Order Management" which follows a little bit other strategy rules.  
Often I have read something about the 2% rule. I personally don't like stop losses in my trading, some of the time here and there but on rare occasions. So it's better to discuss this topic with other members here at board.  
Kindest regards

Oh yes, sure by switching at higher time frames! (e.g. trade M5 and switch at M30 and H1; trade the H1 and switch at H4 and Daily) and you could simply recognize it also at the Price Action.

Divergences near Pivotals could be a great design!  
  
Apart from that - short example:   
If I see a M5 positive bearish divergence I take a look at M15, M30 and H1 and H4 and look these higher timeframes if there aren't any Price Actions which could be possibly more powerful than this little M5 Divergence signal. If not I will go in the Short. That's all.  
Don't complicate things, please. Do it simple but right.

Price Action: A Short-term trading approach   
Trading based on price action has become popular in these last years, mainly because of traders acknowledging that trading based on technical indicators such as moving averages, RSI, CCI, Stochastics and others have a lagging factor that makes us enter late, when the move already happened. This happens because technical indicators, all of them, use the previous market action (i.e. last 21 periods or candlesticks) to calculate the final reading, and what happened in the last n-periods has little or nothing to do with that the market will do, say, in the next 10 periods or candlesticks. In other words, if the market went up on average in the last 21 periods, the indicator reading will point up or give you a long signal, but that doesn’t mean that the market will continue its way up in the next 10 periods.  
In order to adopt a [Forex price action](http://www.straightforex.com/perfect.html) approach we need to take in consideration 3 main aspects: pressure, level and significance.   
  
  
**1 – Pressure** There are two types of pressure: _upward and downward pressure_. We have upward pressure when bulls take control over the market after bear dominance and downward pressure when bears take control over the market over the market after a period of bull dominance. Try to picture this “pressure” on your head, what would it look like? It would look like a “v” shaped pattern as upward pressure or an “inverted v” as downward pressure. Let’s take a look at some images to make sure this is clear.  
  
  

[http://www.straightforex.com/mimages...cles/pa/1a.png](http://www.straightforex.com/mimages/eng/articles/pa/1a.png)

[Image 1]

  
  
The first candlestick moves down (bear dominance – red arrow), but at some point, bulls gain confidence and take control over the market (i.e. bulls felt comfortable trading at those levels) pushing the market back up (bull dominance – blue arrow). If we combine both arrows, we end up with a v shaped pattern (green arrow) with upward pressure.   
  
Does it mean that only known candlestick patters (such as piercings, hammers, shooting stars, etc.) have either upward or downward pressure? NO. In fact, most patterns that have either upward or downward pressure aren’t known candlestick patterns. Take a look at the next image.  
  

[http://www.straightforex.com/mimages...cles/pa/1b.png](http://www.straightforex.com/mimages/eng/articles/pa/1b.png)

[Image 2]

  
This pattern is not known in the candlestick literature, but it still has upward pressure. You still see the “v” market movement.   
  
Next time you see a candlestick pattern, try to picture it in your mind as “v” or “inverted v” pattern, this way you will train your brain to see them as price action, not just as a candlestick pattern.

...  
  
**2 – Level** Another important concept that describes [Forex Price Action](http://www.straightforex.com/perfect.html), is how the market behaves at a place it already traded before. I suspect the reader already knows what we are talking about, if the market was rejected from an important level, the next time it comes close to that level, it is likely to get rejected again. And yes, we are talking about regular support and resistance levels.   
  
This is the reason why we always need to pay attention on where the market has been rejected, specially the short term Support & Resistance levels, because at those levels we always should be ready to open our trades (in the direction of the long term market condition). Please take a look at the next chart:  
  
  

[http://www.straightforex.com/mimages...icles/pa/2.png](http://www.straightforex.com/mimages/eng/articles/pa/2.png)

[Chart 1]

  
  
In this chart, where would you open your trades? If I was to trade this chart, I would look for long opportunities around the bottom of the range, because the market gets rejected every time it gets near that level. And short opportunities around the top of the range, again, because every time the market gets close to this level the market gets rejected.   
  
  
**3 – Significance** Due to the nature of the [Forex market](http://www.straightforex.com/btforex.html) (OTC: over the counter), it’s impossible to get an exact reading of the volume of the market at any given moment. But there are certain measures that can be used as a “proxy variable”, one of them is the significance of the “pattern”.   
  
The significance of the pattern refers to the size of the pattern that triggered the upward/downward pressure compared to the previous candlesticks. If we are tracking a “long” signal, we need to compare the size of the pattern that triggered our long signal to the bear candlesticks that formed the previous downward movement. And vice versa, of we are tracking a “short” signal, we need to compare the size of the pattern that triggered our short signal to the bull candlestick that formed the previous upward movement. Let’s take a look at some images.

The trigger signal in the image above is clearly larger than any of the 3 previous candlesticks that formed the upward movement; therefore it is a significant pattern.

[Chart 2]

  
The pattern (orange square) with downward pressure is formed at an important short term resistance level (green line) and it is also significant (pattern larger than the previous candlesticks). This is considered to be a Forex price action signal to go short.

Price Action Forex Trading – A Clean Strategy to Trade Forex.[](http://cdn1.ltttmstatic.com/wp-content/uploads/p.a-pic.png)[http://cdn1.ltttmstatic.com/wp-conte...ds/p.a-pic.png](http://cdn1.ltttmstatic.com/wp-content/uploads/p.a-pic.png)**  
Hello, and welcome to this trading lesson on “Price Action Forex Trading”. I am sure many of you newer readers will “REALLY” benefit from today’s article which talks about several important concepts.  
  
**Today’s Article Covers …  
**

  1. **1\. What Is Price Action**
  2. **2\. How do You Apply it to Forex Trading?**
  3. **3\. Trading with Messy VS ‘Clean’ Forex Charts**
  4. **4\. Quick Examples of My Forex Price Action Methods.  
**

• **What exactly is price action trading?**  
Price action trading is the art and skill of making all of your trading decisions off of a stripped down or “naked” price chart. This means no lagging indicators outside of maybe a couple moving averages to help identify dynamic [support and resistance](http://www.learntotradethemarket.com/trading-videos/drawing-support-and-resistance-s-and-r-levels/) areas. All financial markets generate data about the movement of a security over varying periods of time in the form of [price charts](http://www.learntotradethemarket.com/forex-trading-strategies/forex-charting-an-introduction-for-beginers/). Price charts reflect the beliefs of all participants trading the given market during the specified period of time.  
All economic data that leads to price movement within a market is first turned into a belief in the human mind about how this data will affect the market and this belief is then turned into an action from a trader which reflects itself via price action on a price chart. In this way price action trading reflects all variables of any market for any given period of time. This is also the reason why using lagging price indictors like stochastics, MACD, RSI, and others is just a flat waste of time. Price movement provides all the signals you will ever need to develop a profitable and high-probability trading system. These signals collectively are called [price action setups](http://www.learntotradethemarket.com/forex-trading-strategies/price-action-setups-pin-bars-fakeys-inside-bars/) and they provide a way to make sense of market movement and predict its future movement with a high enough degree of accuracy to consistently profit over time.  
  
• **How do I apply price action to the forex market?**  
[Price action trading](http://www.learntotradethemarket.com/forex-articles/price-action-trading-the-most-adaptable-forex-trading-method/) can be used to trade any financial market; however the [forex market](http://www.learntotradethemarket.com/forex-articles/why-forex-is-the-best-market-to-trade/) has the deepest liquidity and lowest startup costs as well as widest accessibility of any financial market, for these reasons and more it is the most popular market today among retail traders. My philosophy of price action trading is that you only need to master a few solid setups to be consistently profitable. In fact, having a simple trading method consisting of minimal setups will work to reduce confusion and stress and allow you to concentrate more on the psychological aspect of trading which is what separates the winners from the losers.  
The first step you need to take to apply price action trading to the forex market is to setup a clean “naked” price chart, take off all indicators. Next, master a few solid price action setups; I mainly use the [pin bar](http://www.learntotradethemarket.com/forex-trading-strategies/pin-bars-forex-trading-definition/) reversal, the [inside bar setup](http://www.learntotradethemarket.com/forex-trading-strategies/inside-bar-forex-strateg/), and my proprietary price action setup, the [fakey](http://www.learntotradethemarket.com/trading-videos/forex-trading-trade-the-fakey-setup/). You can make money consistently from mastering just one of these setups, I suggest you work on one at a time, master it, and then move on to the next. In this way you will develop a price action “tool box” which will provide more then enough tools to take advantage of quality price action signals everyday in the forex market.  
  
• **Messy charts vs. clean “naked” price action charts**  
If you have been trading for a while you are probably using numerous [lagging indicators](http://www.learntotradethemarket.com/forex-articles/trading-with-indicators-destroys-forex-trading-success/) on your charts that are no doubt confusing you and are one of the main reasons why you are still unsuccessful and found your way to my price action trading website. For all you newbie traders take a look at the two charts below and ask yourself which one seems more logical and less stressful to make trading decisions from?  
  
**A messy chart with the some of the most popular lagging indicators.**  
[](http://cdn1.ltttmstatic.com/wp-content/uploads/messy2.jpg)[http://cdn1.ltttmstatic.com/wp-conte...ads/messy2.jpg](http://cdn1.ltttmstatic.com/wp-content/uploads/messy2.jpg)  
**  
A clean price action only chart.**  
[](http://cdn1.ltttmstatic.com/wp-content/uploads/clean1.jpg)[http://cdn1.ltttmstatic.com/wp-conte...ads/clean1.jpg](http://cdn1.ltttmstatic.com/wp-content/uploads/clean1.jpg)  
  
Doesn’t it seem a little silly to use a messy chart when you could learn to trade off a clean price action only chart? Trading is hard enough with out a messy chart full of lagging indicators, stop fooling yourself by believing they are helping you. Price action setups are the best predictor of future price movement, all markets operate in “future time”, this means market participants enter trades based on what they believe will happen to a certain security in the future. [Price action](http://www.learntotradethemarket.com/price-action-trading-forex/) is the best indicator of the aggregate belief of all market participants. What happened in the past is the past, lagging indicators only analyze past data and display it to you in a second-hand format that is less clear and less precise than price action. The bottom line is that there is just no logical explanation for using lagging indicators. Price action analysis takes into account all market variables.  
  
• **My price action setups**  
As mentioned previously I stick to three basic and time tested price action setups. They work in all market conditions and provide a unique market perspective that allows you to develop a highly profitable [forex trading plan](http://www.learntotradethemarket.com/forex-trading-strategies/how-to-make-forex-trading-plan-article/). Price action trading is the only way I trade the markets and I have been trading these price action action setups successfully for years. My price action education [forex course ](http://www.learntotradethemarket.com/forex-systems-trading-course/)goes into great detail in regards to exactly how I trade using price action. I have recently also added a beginning trader introductory forex trading course in addition to my advanced price action trading course.

Forex Price Action Trading Strategy   
Written by Philip Newton   
  
**Swing Highs and Lows**  
The first thing that we need to recognise is what is a Swing High and Swing Low. This is probably the easiest part of price action and bar counting although the whole process gets easier with practice.  
[http://www.aboutcurrency.com/images/...swing-high.gif](http://www.aboutcurrency.com/images/strategies/forextradingstrategies/forexswing-high.gif)  
  
I define a swing high as;   
A three bar combination  
A bar preceded and succeeded by lower highs  
  
[http://www.aboutcurrency.com/images/...xswing-low.gif](http://www.aboutcurrency.com/images/strategies/forextradingstrategies/forexswing-low.gif)  
  
I define a swing low as;  
  
A three bar combination   
A bar preceded and succeeded by higher lows  
  
  
**Market Phases**  
There are only three ways the market can go;

  1. Up
  2. Down
  3. Sideways

With the swing high/low definition now in mind we can start to build some layers on to the chart to identify these market phases and start to do a simple count of these swing highs and lows.   
In short

  1. The market is going up when price is making higher highs and higher lows
  2. The market is going down when price is making lower highs and lower lows
  3. The market is going sideways when price is not making higher highs and higher lows _**OR**_ lower highs lower lows

This may sound like child's play and a statement of the obvious but you will be surprised at how often people will forget these simple **_facts_**. One of the biggest questions I get asked is, which way is the market going? By doing a simple exercise you can see which way that price is going and decide on your trading plan and more importantly _**timing of a trade**_.  
  
What do I mean by timing? It may be that you are looking for a shorting opportunity as the overall trend is down but price on your entry time frame is still going up (making HH's & HL's). There is, at this stage, no point in trying to short a rising market until price action start to point down (making LH's & LL's. More on this shortly).  
  
[http://www.aboutcurrency.com/images/...ias-change.gif](http://www.aboutcurrency.com/images/strategies/forextradingstrategies/forexbias-change.gif)   
  
A Short or Bearish Bias Changeoccurs when the following sequence develops.   
HH>HL>LH>LL>LH The bias change is confirmed when price moves below the las lower low made as highlighted on the chart.  
Another way of saying this is 123 reversal and you are trading the pullback as your entry trigger (Red Line).  
There are a few variations of this pattern but this is quite simply a price action bias change in its simplest form.  
  
[http://www.aboutcurrency.com/images/...s-change-1.gif](http://www.aboutcurrency.com/images/strategies/forextradingstrategies/forexbias-change-1.gif)  
  
A Long or Bullish Bias Change occurs when the following sequence develops.  
LL>LH>HL>HH>HL The bias change is confirmed when price moves above the last higher high made as highlighted on the chart.  
Another way of saying this is 123 reversal and you are trading the pullback as your entry trigger (Blue Line).  
There are a few variations of this pattern but this is quite simply a price action bias change in its simplest form.

follow-up  
  
**Trending Price Action**  
After a bias change has been seen and confirmed, one of the phases that the market can then take is to start trending either up or down depending on the bias change previously.  
In the chart below we can see what price ideally looks like when price is trending up and trending down. Each phase shows price making HH's & HL's on its way up and LH's & LL's on its way down.  
  
[http://www.aboutcurrency.com/images/...rending-up.gif](http://www.aboutcurrency.com/images/strategies/forextradingstrategies/forextrending-up.gif)   
  
[http://www.aboutcurrency.com/images/...nding-down.gif](http://www.aboutcurrency.com/images/strategies/forextradingstrategies/forextrending-down.gif)   
  
**Ranging Price action**  
Now this is where the chart can become interesting. By using the price action counting of the swing highs and lows we can know at a very early stage IFprice is going to start to develop range bound activity.

  1. Price is not making new highs OR new lows

I don't mean all time highs/lows or new day/week/month highs/lows... just simply a new chart swing high or low. Price will start to stall and not make a new swing high/low and typically will stay contained within the last swing high and low that was made on the chart. Isn't that a simple definition?  
  
**Range rule definitions**

  1. Price doesn't make a new high or low on the move
  2. If price stays contained within the last swing high and swing low to be made, price will remain range bound until it makes news move highs or lows.
  3. Price confirms the range when a lower high **and** a higher low is made **within the previous** swing high and low.

In the chart below you can see that from the left side of the chart price is making LH's & LL's all the way to the first blue arrow which in real time would be the latest lowest low. Price then moves higher to make a HH. These two swing levels have been highlighted.  
At the point of the chart, in real time, price needs to either start moving higher past the last swing high (red Arrow) making a new high _**OR**_ move lower past the last swing low (blue arrow) making a new low. Until either of those things happens price will most likely remain range bound. In this example that is what happened.  
  
[http://www.aboutcurrency.com/images/...Rangebound.gif](http://www.aboutcurrency.com/images/strategies/forextradingstrategies/forexRangebound.gif)   
  
**Range considerations**  
Some considerations for identifying ranges at an early stage in real time are; 

  1. That price could be creating a pullback or bias change and as the chart unfolds for you a new high or low could be made voiding the potential range.
  2. There are several definitions of a range one of the more common ones is that you are looking for a _double touch_ of support and resistance. For me this is a little too late in the game as price may not create the _double touch_ as in the example above. With this price action method you can identify the possibility of a range developing _**VERY**_ early without having to worry _**IF**_ price does or does not give you the _double touch_. As you can see with that definition you would interpret that price is not range bound at all but, you can clearly see visually that price is moving sideways without any definition.  
  
**What you should have learnt from this short article**

    1. A simple rule defined method to identify swing highs and lows
    2. How to use this swing high/low definition to interpret price action market phases
    3. How to identify a bias change
    4. How to identify trending price action
    5. How to identify Range bound price action

  
  
**Bias Change pattern variation**  
In the below images we can see the pattern variation and compare them to the outlined pattern above. The only main difference is that you are looking for a breach of a previous swing high or low as the first qualifier to indicate a potential bias change.

**Acronyms used**

  1. HH - Higher High
  2. HL - Higher Low
  3. LH - Lower High
  4. LL - Lower Low

There wasn't any CCI(14) Divergence! So there are no need to trade anything and the second reason is: don't trade at crazy fridays.   
I wish you good luck the next time!

I'm very sorry! I look exclusively at CCI(14). But I think the internet would have to have been full of it since several years.

I have a question about your book , i've seen that you keep your long EURUSD open is it because of the bullish divergence on the 1H and 4H TF ??... or there is no real reason for it ?

>  For me it depends at my risk tolerance and my deposits and my Profits which I have make before but the most important parameter is for me at which time frame I go with the Order in the market and with how much lot sizes. If I trade 1/10 I let often run the order two times or four times over the normal stop loss level which you could read in the forex literature here and there. 90-98% of all these trades are coming back in the win zone sooner or later and the remaining 2-10% I take it over into my "Loss Order Management" (say I often...

Hi Landsat  
Partly defined.  
H1 could be too late due to the fact that the upward move was done. H4 Divergence?, Yes, indeed! There is a classic one and in close contact with the Daily CCI(14) Bottom. Remark also, please, that the daily candles (body & wick) overlay each other often (1<2, 2<3, 4<5, 5<6, 6<7, 7<8, 8<9, 9<10, 10<11, 11<12, 12<13, 13<14, 14<15), ...so why not the next Monday Daily Candle no. 16 = 15<16?), see the chart below, please. Anyway it could be also more down at Monday but I have decide to take the risk over and will set a Stop Loss or a Hedging Order at Monday. The Weekly Candle looks too long and ready for a retrace at first (see #[**295**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5169204#post5169204), please), take a look further more at the Weekly, please: DS3 (Pivotal Point) has reached, on the other hand the Monthly could go further downside (see also #[**295**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5169204#post5169204), please), but likely not instantly.  
Kindest regards

I hate you....because you are often talking about very obvious things on the graph, that i was not able to spot myself before you mention it....  
  
its always difficult on a early sunday morning , that even after 20 years in front of the graph ,to realise that i m still on the "Discovery Mode "....But in fact this is ,what i like the most with trading, it's an "never ending learning experience".  
  
Thank's and we are delighted to be onboard with you, im sure many of us enjoy the ride .....

**[ Martin J. Pring’s 19 Trading Rules to Beat the Markets ](http://www.fxtimes.com/education/martin-j-prings-19-trading-rules-to-beat-the-markets/) **  
19 Trading Rules to Beat the Markets (Watch the [Webinar for this article](http://www.fxtimes.com/live-events/webinar-%e2%80%93-thursday-%e2%80%93-11-10-11-topic-to-be-determined-3pm-et-1900-gmt/))  
  
Since entering the financial markets in 1969, Martin J. Pring has become a leader in the global investor community. He is the chairman of a conservative money management firm, Pring Turner Capital. He is known for developing economic indicators and also well known for his contribution in educating traders and investors. In fact some of his books are requirements for those seeking the CMT (Chartered Market Technician) designation. In one of these books, _[Investment Psychology Explained – Classic Strategies to Beat the Markets](http://www.amazon.com/Investment-Psychology-Explained-Classic-Strategies/dp/0471133000)_ , he lists 19 classic trading rules. Below is a summary and my interpretation of his rules and how I think they can be applied. Rule 1-10 are psychological management rules while 11-19 are risk management rules.  
  
**Rule 1: When in Doubt, Stay Out** – Sure, you can’t ever get rid of all uncertainty. However, if you are going to do the research and come up with a trade idea, you need to have confidence in the reason you are entering the trade. Otherwise, you will not have the conviction to stick with a trade and might get “shaken” out by [noise](http://www.fxtimes.com/glossary/noise/). On the other hand if you do have a sound reason to enter the trade, but that reason becomes invalid, you no longer have the justification to stay in. In this case, an exit is warranted because otherwise it is simply a gamble. You are not in this business to gamble, but to invest or trade into sound market research and analysis.  
Application: make a list of setups, or events that need to happen before a trade should be considered.  
  
**Rule 2: Never Invest or Trade Based on Hope** – This complements rule 1. If you are not confident in your analysis and reason for trading, you invite hope into the picture. When you start praying to your God or lady luck, you have become a gambler, and not a trader/investor. Because in both gambling and investing, there is uncertainty, there is a thin line between the two “fields”.  
Application: Try to be as mechanical as possible when it comes to entry and exit methodology. Don’t leave room for hope when the market is against you and hit your stop level.  
  
**Rule 3: Act on Your Own Judgement or Else Absolutely and Entirely on the Judgement of Others** \- Basically, what Pring is saying here is to have consistent method in your trading, and have confidence in it. Your sources of information from which you derive a strategy should be sound, and if you trade frequently, they should not vary from trade to trade. You don’t scrap all your analysis just because some analyst somewhere offers his or her expert opinion. If you try to resolve what all these “experts” are trying to say, you might end up with analysis paralysis. Find a consistent method and stick to it, otherwise keep working on your method, OR let a professional manage your account. (In this scenario, make sure you do the research on your money manager).  
Application: Make a checklist of resources that you based your information on. ie. economic releases, [technical analysis](http://www.fxtimes.com/glossary/technical-analysis/), opinions of analysts you follow consistently. If someone offers analysis you have not encountered before, take time to work it into your routine decision making instead of just taking it face value.  
  
**Rule 4: Buy Low (into Weakness), Sell High (into Strength)** – This is probably the first thing anybody hears about in trading. It does not mean pick a top or bottom. It does not mean trade against the [trend](http://www.fxtimes.com/glossary/trend/). It is also much harder and more complicated then it sounds. In the end, the idea is to avoid chasing the market. Let the market come to you.  
Application: In a [range](http://www.fxtimes.com/glossary/range/) bound market, define areas of [support](http://www.fxtimes.com/glossary/support/) and [resistance](http://www.fxtimes.com/glossary/resistance/). Look for selling opportunities at [resistance](http://www.fxtimes.com/glossary/resistance/) and buying opportunities at [support](http://www.fxtimes.com/glossary/support/). In a trending market, say bullish, only look to buy on dips. Vice versa during a bearish market look to fade rallies. Again, this is just a general concept and the actual decision to trade should be determined along with other factors.  
  
**Rule 5: Don’t Overtrade** – The only reason to trade is if the market is giving you the signals you believe to provide trading opportunities. However, there will be times when being objective is difficult. Other reasons can cloud your judgement. For example if you had a disappointing week, you might pin your hopes in trading to pick yourself up. Or subconsciously trading might be an entertainment and provide emotional fulfillment.  
Application: Making the trading process as mechanical as you can will eliminate some of the “garbage” factors in trading. It is also important to prepare yourself mentally and emotionally before your trading sessions. Get your mind cleared up of outside influences. Treat trading as a professional endeavor, because as soon as you don’t, it becomes gambling.  
  
**Rule 6: After a Successful and Profitable Trading Campaign, Take a Trading Vacation** \- This rule helps to eliminate overconfidence and addresses the fact that trading performance is cyclical. Besides, don’t you want to have a life?  
Application: Knowing when NOT to trade is as much a discipline as knowing when to trade. Therefore you need to define what it is to have a profitable campaign and what it takes to return to objectivity after gaining confidence. When you feel like you’re superman, and when you start making projections into the future based on your recent period of success, you should be alarmed that you are near that peak of your cycle.  
  
**Rule 7: Take a Periodic Mental Inventory to See How You are Doing -** This rule basically reminds you to stay objective, and understand that trading is a very cerebral process.  
Application: Create a checklist of questions before you trade ie. Am I emotionally stable at the moment? Am I overtrading? Am I sticking to my trading plan? Can I afford the risk if the market does not go the direction anticipated?  
  
**Rule 8: Constantly Analyze Your Mistakes –** Understanding yourself is very important in a world full of uncertainties. When you win, it is very likely that you attribute success to hard work, and when you lose the tendency is to attribute it to bad luck. Knowing this bias, you should look deeper to recognize mistakes in judgement.  
Application: There are different types of mistakes. 1) Bad execution – Did you make a trade that is not part of your system? If so ask yourself why. Did it come from an emotional trigger like fear of missing a trade. 2) Bad trade management – It is one thing to make the wrong call, it is another to allow the bad call to become a major drawdown. Ask yourself if the mistake was contained. Were you hoping the market comes back? Did you exit due to despair after loss of hope? If so, you probably entered the trade without enough consideration of the risk and only looked at the prospect of profit. Lack of preparation therefore can lead to inability to manage your loss. 3) Systematic – Only when you can rule out the first 2 types of mistake, can you truly be objective in analyzing your method. If losses are piling up despite sticking to your plan and containing losses, it is time to get back to the drawing board. Step away and look at your trading strategy.  
  
**Rule 9: Don’t Jump the Gun** \- Be disciplined. That’s all. If you have a specific trading strategy, you have to wait until the signals are there. Otherwise, what’s the point of having a strategy. Unless you have been in this profession for 20 years and still surviving, don’t rely on “intuition”. This is something you have to build through countless trades, and the only way to gain intuition is to begin with discipline.  
Application: Be as mechanical as you can. Refrain from the temptation of justifying a trade without your signals simply because you believe it is an exceptional situation. There can be exceptional factors everyday, so if you go on these reasons, you might as well not have a trading plan at all. So again, a checklist of signals required might be helpful in making the trading process as mechanical as possible.  
  
**Rule 10: Don’t Try to Call Every Market Turn** – Yes we want to buy into weakness and sell into strength. But that does not mean picking tops and bottoms. It might be emotionally satisfying to be able to call the top, then pick the bottom, but to be able to do this is an unrealistic expectation.  
Application: You might want to set up for counter-[trend](http://www.fxtimes.com/glossary/trend/) trades near some major market tops and bottoms, but trying to get in at all the twist and turns will make you overtrade and be chopped up by the market.  
  
**Rule 11: Never Enter into a Position Without First Establishing a Reward to Risk-** Pring suggests trading at least 3-1 reward to risk ratio. Also, knowing what type of risk is involved helps with position sizing and limiting losses to level that won’t devastate your account. This also provides emotional preparation in the case of a bad call.  
Application: Be careful not to give false expectation of reward to risk in order to justify a trade. You have to define where your trade idea becomes invalid. That is your projected stop. You also have to define where you can expect the market to go in your favor by looking at some pivots ([support](http://www.fxtimes.com/glossary/support/) and [resistance](http://www.fxtimes.com/glossary/resistance/)). Now just because you made these assessments, it doesn’t mean you should always just set your stop and limit and walk away. There will be times where you have to adjust and maybe lock in profits before the market reaches your target. Sometimes you might have to make an emergency exit before reaching your stop. While your exit might require more agility, your entry should follow a more rigid reasoning and having a minimum reward to risk is important. While 3-1 is a good reward to risk ratio, a minimum could probably be 2-1.  
  
**Rule 12: Cut losses, Let Profits Run** – This is another one of those sounds easier said than done type of rule, but it is probably the most important as far as trade management is concerned. Cutting losses requires discipline and leaves no room for hope. Don’t justify staying in the trade if the market action already invalidates your reason of entry. This does not mean to abandon a trade at the first sign of failure. You will often need to give the market some “elbow space” to have a chance to go in the direction you anticipated. Cutting losses means your original reasoning is invalid AND the risk is no longer acceptable. Of course, you would have ad to establish what risk is involved before hand. Letting profit run is also a difficult task. You have to define before hand what signals you look for in exiting. If these signs are not there, letting the profit run is the prudent action. But you also have to consider locking in profits.  
Application: Again, in reality this process is more difficult then it sounds. Knowing when to cut your losses and how to let your profit run will require experience with your trading methodology. Spend as much time if not more in developing exit strategy as developing your entry tactic. A trade is not over until the exit and it is the exit that defines the performance of trade, not the entry.  
  
**Rule 13: Place Numerous Small Bets on Low Risk Ideas** – Statistically, the more you trade your system, the more likely the performance will reflect that of the system. There will be inevitable losses and in having few trades with large exposure, you risk being in the period of drawdown in your system. Allowing more trades means allowing more chance of your trading system to show its true nature. This means limiting the exposure for each trade.  
Application: Pring and the conventional suggestion for exposure per trade (EPT) is 5%. I would say even lower EPT is better especially if you plan on having multiple positions open because there could be a period where you will actually have exposure up to 10%. If you do, make it a point to reduce that exposure at specific times. For example if you are a intraday trader, you might want to close some positions that are not looking as good as others during the end of a trading session for the region ie (end of the US trading session). Or if your positions are already in the black, you might want to move your stop close to lock in a profit and thereby reducing exposure. Remember, exposure is how much you are willing to risk and can be defined by where you place your stop.  
  
**Rule 14: Look Down, not Up** – Pring reminds traders that the decision to trade is not just based on potential profit, but also potential of loss and acceptability of this loss relative to expectation of the profit.  
Application: Also start a trade decision with consideration of loss. Then look at what the potential reward is. This is important because if you look at the potential reward first, you might become too optimistic and overlook the real risk involved.  
  
**Rule 15: Never Trade or Invest More Than you Can Reasonably Afford to Lose** \- Only trade your risk capital. Not diaper money, not grocery money. If you trade money that if lost will devastate your living standard, you will have too much emotional attachment to each trade and that can cloud your judgement.  
Application: I think this is quite clear – only invest risk capital. This is why brokers will ask you about your income and such. Regulatory agencies have made it the [broker](http://www.fxtimes.com/glossary/broker/)’s responsibility to deny accounts to people that are not suitable in terms of having risk capital. As a trader though, this responsibility should be all on your shoulder.  
  
**Rule 16: Don’t Fight the[Trend](http://www.fxtimes.com/glossary/trend/)** – The [trend](http://www.fxtimes.com/glossary/trend/) is your friend is a common saying in the trading/investment community. While there are times to be contrarian and play major tops or bottoms, it wouldn’t be wise to always be a contrarian. Most of the time you want to run with the herd. Don’t try to catch a falling knife is another saying warning you from trading against a sharp move.  
Application: You might ask, doesn’t this go against the buy into strength, sell into weakness rule? f you can resolve these two rules you understand the uncertainty of the market and how you have to juggle contradicting ideas. As mentioned in the application of rule 4, trade in the direction of the [trend](http://www.fxtimes.com/glossary/trend/), after [noise](http://www.fxtimes.com/glossary/noise/) against the [trend](http://www.fxtimes.com/glossary/trend/). In order to do all these, you have to define what is a [trend](http://www.fxtimes.com/glossary/trend/), and what is [noise](http://www.fxtimes.com/glossary/noise/). That is a topic for another day.  
  
**Rule 17: Whenever Possible Trade Liquid Markets –** A Liquid market as Pring defines it is one that has many participants with differing opinions so there are traders on each side of the market willing to take positions. In this case, your trading cost will be lower. Although forex is the most liquid financial market, especially in popular instruments like [EUR](http://www.fxtimes.com/glossary/eur/)/USD, the spread can widen in event of economic releases or important press conferences and speeches. Trading during these events can be costly not only because of the wider spread, but also because it is often impossible to determine how the market will react, and react to the reaction, and so forth. For the short-term trader, it is probably more prudent to stay away from these event risks, and wait for the dust to settle before getting in.  
Application: Avoid trading 30 minutes before or after an important release. This means you will inevitably miss some moves. But if you look at it objectively, you are always missing moves. When you happen to be right and miss a move, you might kick yourself. But is your emotional impact the same when your opinion is wrong and instead of missing profit, you avoided a loss? You’re likely to give the latter the same weight and therefore have a faulty bias that you are always missing good calls. Now, if objectively you do find yourself to always make good calls in terms of reactions to risk events, go for it. But the wiser thing to do is probably to first see how the market reacts to them before making a decision to trade these events.  
  
**Rule 18: Never Meet a[Margin](http://www.fxtimes.com/glossary/margin/) Call **\- “Never meet it by sending in more money” is Pring’s advice. If you are meeting a [margin](http://www.fxtimes.com/glossary/margin/) call, something very wrong is happening. Either you are overleveraged or overtrading, or both. Also, it means you are not monitoring your EPT. Whatever the reason, adding more funds immediately to remedy a [margin](http://www.fxtimes.com/glossary/margin/) call is like pouring more gas into a leaking tank. You have to first fix the leak.  
Application: In this unfortunate time, Pring suggests taking a vacation. Your emotional state is probably not right for trading at the moment and you will have to step away from the market to regain clarity before deciding to add more funds. If you have enough funds, and it was solely overleveraging and overtrading, you might have to make a request to your broke to lessen that [leverage](http://www.fxtimes.com/glossary/leverage/), and also get it in your head to limit your EPT.  
  
**Rule 19: If You Are Going to Place a Stop, Put it at a Logical, Not Convenient Place** \- The position of the stop should be based on fundamental and technical reasons, and not based on how much you can afford to lose. For example, if you determine that you can only expose $300 in the trade, don’t place the stop simply where the market would give you that loss. Instead, after determining the stop placement, and with the understanding of your EPT, decide on your position size.  
Application: Here are a couple of links for risk management applications that deal with stop placement and position sizing among other issues:

**John Murphy's Ten Laws of Technical Trading**  
  
_StockCharts.com's Chief Technical Analyst, John Murphy, is a very popular author, columnist, and speaker on the subject of Technical Analysis. John's "Ten Laws of Technical Trading" is the best guide available anywhere for people who are new to the field of charting. I urge you to print out this page and refer to it often. If you find this information useful, consider subscribing to[StockCharts' Market Message](http://stockcharts.com/corp/MurphyDetails.html)._   
Which way is the market moving? How far up or down will it go? And when will it go the other way? These are the basic concerns of the technical analyst. Behind the charts and graphs and mathematical formulas used to analyze market trends are some basic concepts that apply to most of the theories employed by today's technical analysts.   
John Murphy, StockCharts.com's Chief Technical Analyst, has drawn upon his thirty years of experience in the field to develop ten basic laws of technical trading: rules that are designed to help explain the whole idea of technical trading for the beginner and to streamline the trading methodology for the more experienced practitioner. These precepts define the key tools of technical analysis and how to use them to identify buying and selling opportunities.   
Before joining StockCharts, John was the technical analyst for CNBC-TV for seven years on the popular show **Tech Talk** , and has authored three best-selling books on the subject: [Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets](http://store.stockcharts.com/products/technical-analysis-of-the-financial-markets-1), [Intermarket Analysis](http://store.stockcharts.com/products/intermarket-analysis) and [The Visual Investor](http://store.stockcharts.com/products/the-visual-investor-2nd-edition).   
His most recent book demonstrates the essential visual elements of technical analysis. The fundamentals of John's approach to technical analysis illustrate that it is more important to determine where a market is going (up or down) rather than the why behind it.   
The following are John's ten most important rules of technical trading: 

  1. [Map the Trends](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:trading_strategies:john_murphy_s_ten_laws#map_the_trends)
  2. [Spot the Trend and Go With It](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:trading_strategies:john_murphy_s_ten_laws#spot_the_trend_and_g)
  3. [Find the Low and High of It](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:trading_strategies:john_murphy_s_ten_laws#find_the_low_and_hig)
  4. [Know How Far to Backtrack](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:trading_strategies:john_murphy_s_ten_laws#know_how_far_to_back)
  5. [Draw the Line](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:trading_strategies:john_murphy_s_ten_laws#draw_the_line)
  6. [Follow That Average](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:trading_strategies:john_murphy_s_ten_laws#follow_that_average)
  7. [Learn the Turns](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:trading_strategies:john_murphy_s_ten_laws#learn_the_turns)
  8. [Know the Warning Signs](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:trading_strategies:john_murphy_s_ten_laws#know_the_warning_sig)
  9. [Trend or Not a Trend?](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:trading_strategies:john_murphy_s_ten_laws#trend_or_not_a_trend)
  10. [Know the Confirming Signs](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:trading_strategies:john_murphy_s_ten_laws#know_the_confirming_)

  
**1\. Map the Trends**  
  
Study long-term charts. Begin a chart analysis with monthly and weekly charts spanning several years. A larger scale map of the market provides more visibility and a better long-term perspective on a market. Once the long-term has been established, then consult daily and intra-day charts. A short-term market view alone can often be deceptive. Even if you only trade the very short term, you will do better if you're trading in the same direction as the intermediate and longer term trends.   
  
**2\. Spot the Trend and Go With It**  
  
Determine the trend and follow it. Market trends come in many sizes – long-term, intermediate-term and short-term. First, determine which one you're going to trade and use the appropriate chart. Make sure you trade in the direction of that trend. Buy dips if the trend is up. Sell rallies if the trend is down. If you're trading the intermediate trend, use daily and weekly charts. If you're day trading, use daily and intra-day charts. But in each case, let the longer range chart determine the trend, and then use the shorter term chart for timing.   
  
**3\. Find the Low and High of It**  
  
Find support and resistance levels. The best place to buy a market is near support levels. That support is usually a previous reaction low. The best place to sell a market is near resistance levels. Resistance is usually a previous peak. After a resistance peak has been broken, it will usually provide support on subsequent pullbacks. In other words, the old "high" becomes the new low. In the same way, when a support level has been broken, it will usually produce selling on subsequent rallies – the old "low" can become the new "high."   
  
**4\. Know How Far to Backtrack**  
  
Measure percentage retracements. Market corrections up or down usually retrace a significant portion of the previous trend. You can measure the corrections in an existing trend in simple percentages. A fifty percent retracement of a prior trend is most common. A minimum retracement is usually one-third of the prior trend. The maximum retracement is usually two-thirds. Fibonacci retracements of 38% and 62% are also worth watching. During a pullback in an uptrend, therefore, initial buy points are in the 33-38% retracement area.   
  
**5\. Draw the Line**  
  
Draw trend lines. Trend lines are one of the simplest and most effective charting tools. All you need is a straight edge and two points on the chart. Up trend lines are drawn along two successive lows. Down trend lines are drawn along two successive peaks. Prices will often pull back to trend lines before resuming their trend. The breaking of trend lines usually signals a change in trend. A valid trend line should be touched at least three times. The longer a trend line has been in effect, and the more times it has been tested, the more important it becomes.   
  
**6\. Follow that Average**  
  
Follow moving averages. Moving averages provide objective buy and sell signals. They tell you if existing trend is still in motion and help confirm a trend change. Moving averages do not tell you in advance, however, that a trend change is imminent. A combination chart of two moving averages is the most popular way of finding trading signals. Some popular futures combinations are 4- and 9-day moving averages, 9- and 18-day, 5- and 20-day. Signals are given when the shorter average line crosses the longer. Price crossings above and below a 40-day moving average also provide good trading signals. Since moving average chart lines are trend-following indicators, they work best in a trending market.   
  
**7\. Learn the Turns**  
  
Track oscillators. Oscillators help identify overbought and oversold markets. While moving averages offer confirmation of a market trend change, oscillators often help warn us in advance that a market has rallied or fallen too far and will soon turn. Two of the most popular are the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Stochastics. They both work on a scale of 0 to 100. With the RSI, readings over 70 are overbought while readings below 30 are oversold. The overbought and oversold values for Stochastics are 80 and 20. Most traders use 14-days or weeks for stochastics and either 9 or 14 days or weeks for RSI. Oscillator divergences often warn of market turns. These tools work best in a trading market range. Weekly signals can be used as filters on daily signals. Daily signals can be used as filters for intra-day charts.   
  
**8\. Know the Warning Signs**  
  
Trade MACD. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator (developed by Gerald Appel) combines a moving average crossover system with the overbought/oversold elements of an oscillator. A buy signal occurs when the faster line crosses above the slower and both lines are below zero. A sell signal takes place when the faster line crosses below the slower from above the zero line. Weekly signals take precedence over daily signals. An MACD histogram plots the difference between the two lines and gives even earlier warnings of trend changes. It's called a "histogram" because vertical bars are used to show the difference between the two lines on the chart.   
  
**9\. Trend or Not a Trend**  
  
Use ADX. The Average Directional Movement Index (ADX) line helps determine whether a market is in a trending or a trading phase. It measures the degree of trend or direction in the market. A rising ADX line suggests the presence of a strong trend. A falling ADX line suggests the presence of a trading market and the absence of a trend. A rising ADX line favors moving averages; a falling ADX favors oscillators. By plotting the direction of the ADX line, the trader is able to determine which trading style and which set of indicators are most suitable for the current market environment.   
  
**10\. Know the Confirming Signs**  
  
Include volume and open interest. Volume and open interest are important confirming indicators in futures markets. Volume precedes price. It's important to ensure that heavier volume is taking place in the direction of the prevailing trend. In an uptrend, heavier volume should be seen on up days. Rising open interest confirms that new money is supporting the prevailing trend. Declining open interest is often a warning that the trend is near completion. A solid price uptrend should be accompanied by rising volume and rising open interest.   
  
**"11."**  
  
Technical analysis is a skill that improves with experience and study. Always be a student and keep learning.   
\- John Murphy   
  
**Definitions:** Leonardo Fibonacci was a thirteenth century mathematician who "rediscovered" a precise and almost constant relationship between Hindu-Arabic numbers in a sequence (1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,etc. to infinity). The sum of any two consecutive numbers in this sequence equals the next higher number. After the first four, the ratio of any number in the sequence to its next higher number approaches .618. That ratio was known to the ancient Greek and Egyptian mathematicians as the "Golden Mean" which had critical applications in art, architecture and in nature.   
  
**Stochastics** \- an oscillator popularized by George Lane in an article on the subject which appeared in 1984. It is based on the observation that as prices increase, closing prices tend to be closer to the upper end of the price range; conversely, in down trends, closing prices tend to be near the lower end of the range. Stochastics has slightly wider overbought and oversold boundaries than the RSI and is therefore a more volatile indicator. The term "stochastic" refers to the location of a current futures price in relation to its range over a set period of time (usually 14 days).

Oui, en effet. Très variée.  
  
...and here we have it and maybe it's not over.  
  
It could sometimes be the better strategy to let some orders open over the week-end with due regard to the Price Action at last Friday at different time frames.

I know you're expecting a comment from forexcube but straight away i can say, which is very obvious do not trade between the pivot lines, always wait for the price come to pivots otherwise your stop loss will be hit very easily

Hi only1kader!  
Your first step could be a good choice.  
I would compare now M5, M30, H1, H4 and Daily and would select from this multiple time frame analysis these charts which could give the highest probabilities for making a profit. (Daily looks great, also up; H4 not so, H1 indifferent, M30 seems to be also signalize an up like M15). I would also trade the M5 pos. divergence with a Long and keep in mind that the next pivotal is DR3 0.9864. The actual market price (0.9896) could move more downwards by increasing Volatility and DR3 could be hit. Then we could also get something like the M30 chart below.

How I decide to trade sometimes!  
  
2 Step.  
...to process data  
  
Okay, Weekly (#[**329**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5174378#post5174378)) is signalizing a Shooting Star and the Monthly (#[**329**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5174378#post5174378)) has a Resistance above the last monthly candles.  
  
_"How can I handle these informations?_ "  
  
...and make up my mind.  
  
_Daily  
"Okay, when I trade the daily, I could set a Stop loss above the Dailys' Tops or the recent monthly candles over the yellow resistance line".  
  
Weeky  
Weekly seems stable. The price market seems moving in a range (since September 2010) with an actual ascending CCI(14) Top Level.  
A downward movement seems at the weekly chart probable.  
  
Monthly  
Next year 2012 could be interesting for a bigger monthly upward movement (Long Term Trade), when the resistance line will intersect.

I will trade these charts actual separately (in one Orderblock M15-H4).  
  
M30 has had a pos. divergence, so also M15 and H1/H4 (#[**331**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5174412#post5174412)) are moving upwards._

How I decide to trade sometimes!  
  
4 Step.  
...last reflections of all pro and cons and break it down into some trading decisions  
  
Summary  
  
I will focus the Daily for my Long Term Investments and the M5 actual for my short term trades and after London Market Close (we have now 22:12 GMT+1) trading the M1 as well.  
  
I will trade moreover every M15 and M30 Divergence (see #[**332**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5174421#post5174421)) at 1/10 a throw so long as H1/H4 could give supporting signals.

Be aware  
The remarks above reflects some ideas how I would make some trade decisions. It could be that you will come to other decision parameters for your trading. It could be also okay! Why not!

Hi only1kader  
For getting more reliable data, you have to look at higher time frames also and take a look at the pivotal points. I hope you have recognized that I do not trade every divergences at M1/M5 alone. You could upload the M15/M30 and H1 and H4 charts here besides your M5 and I can give you a more qualified answer to this market environment where you have make the decision to trade the M5 chart. It don't make sense to use M5 blindside!  
  
Note  
..and when you make the statement "i saw FXcube 100% success, but i am having some trouble here. " then it's briefly...nonsense!  
Your comments seems stupid and simple, ... and sounds in this way kinda aggressive. Don't put it plainly and simple, please. You could risk a banishment with your impolite way of doing.  
Kindest regards

EURUSD, H4, 2011 November 29  
  
H4 could be further up if no political news will force the market price further down. Then abrupt downside movement could be also possible for me.  
  
I like to trade at M1/M5 actual and wait at H4 for a clearer trend.  
  
Some Hedging Orders are running in the market also just now.

+15 pips ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
ForexCube, maybe now i got it, lemme explain..  
  
Price at 1.3435, mR2 level.  
  
1h: Overtbought with divergence  
15': Hooking from extreme, momentum diminishing  
5': OB, "continous" divergence, breaking the previous CCI level  
1': "Spiked" (tops) divergence  
  
TP: DR1@1.3407, 2% profit.  
  
I entered when 1m CCI has gone out overbought for confirmation, but wasn't a great idea (i could get a better price, aka 20+ pips profit).  
  
Can you "rate" this analysis? Was it good?  
Have any advice for me?  
  
Sorry for my english! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)

Hi SteMag  
Hi only1kader  
  
It's pleasing that you ask me a lot of questions about your M1/M5 trading actual. Unfortunately I don't have much time during the day to give you an answer inasmuch as I trade during the day.   
I have open a 10K Account since last week specially built for the purposes of following some trades.  
<http://www.forexfactory.com/forexcube>  
See furthermore #[**359**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5177532#post5177532), please.

EURUSD, H4, 2011 November 29  
EURUSD, Daily, 2011 November 29  
  
Global View.  
  
H4 Support Lines seems for me intact supportet by a Daily Double Bottom.  
  
If the market price would these powerful barriers running down then I would tend to go more Short with the higher time frames.  
  
Otherwise the Daily could shape an indifferent candle today, like the day before. If so then the market price has to go down before NY close.  
  
I trade the ups and downs at M1/M5 actual.   
  
  
We'll see!

I don't trade the whole day long. If I would do so maybe I would lose much money. I don't know. Most of the time I wait for a better entry chance by monitoring H1 and H4. If I do so I minimize my losses and gain time for making more profit. My "Loss Order Management" seems also more efficient.

One day or other we have to talk about "unstable market situations".  
Where can I define it? What have I to do then?,...and so on.  
Basically you could earn money also in these unstable market situations, but you have to take over more risk.  
The right time frame looms large.

but i did not understand what you mean by :::"I trade the ups and downs at M1/M5 actual".:::  
  
Don't you wait for divergence ??? if the higher time frame shows downtrend, would you take the oversold zone buy position trade ?  
  
i mean if the trend is up. would you take the down of cci ???  
  
i hope you understand my English! lol

No, No. be sure I trade in your way!,..all the CCI's Tops and Bottoms at M1/M5 with a look at M15,M30,H1,H4.   
  
These statements makes really no sense, is it?   
If it would makes sense then you haven't understand this thread! So I think these questions you could answer by yourself.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

ok i understand...  
  
and i did same...  
  
i just could not get your words that time...  
  
all i understand from your thread is you are using CCI in two ways.

See #[**365**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5178067#post5178067)  
  
Hi only1kader  
  
You could post your trades. Of course. That's not the problem, but I'm not your private assistent to teach you and have to answer all your questions. Sure not! You could ask other members here at board, who have understand this strategy and my comments. If I would that someone gives me teacher lessons, I would ask him at first. That is common decency. I think also you have read the introduction at p.1, #1: "I will give examples here and there of my trading style when I have the time and the love to do it". Accept it, please. I think also you and SteMag are on a good way! Keep up the good work! Most of all you have to get experience with this CCI-Trading for several weeks and months and a lot of questions sort itself out!  
Kindest regards  
FXcube

why wait for cci 14 reaches 0?  
to avoid the divergence in the upper TF H1  
plus is the start of a new trend (large or small) in H1

Hello everybody, this is a scary one, but it was a good +9 or something, i managed to take only a +4 'cause of a late entry (was making tea ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1))  
  
Price: .3261, Just pirced DS1, high negative momentum  
  
15': Hooking from extreme  
5': Bottoming divergence  
1': Bottoming divergence, CCI coming out of -100  
  
Entry @ .3261, SL@.3256 for 5 pips, TP@DS1 for +9 pips

..Secret is consistency, i guess:  
  
Price @ 3282/3  
  
5': HFE  
1': Diverging   
  
SL@Top or fixed amount, TP@DS1 11/12 pips  
  
The divergence on the m1 was actually double.

And another two trades, but i didn't take those, they were scary ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
  
Nedless to say, a decrease of the momentum was clear..  
  
I'm just curious to hear ForexCube about #373 and #372 trades, if he can and want!

Refering to #375  
  
Ok, shorted and gained 5.5 pips (>+1%), i definitley must work on exits, i left way too much money on the table.  
But again, as ForexCube statements says, consistency seems to be the key.  
  
Price: .3300, round number  
  
5': Overbought, HFE, "Soft" topping divergence  
1': Divergence, HFE, CCI exiting from +100 (didn't wait for it this time)  
  
SL 7.5 pips (1.5%), TP 5.5 pips on CCI OS  
  
Now i will stay out, resting while watching econ news.  
  
BTW, look at the price feed differences **on the same broker** , just different plantform.. unbelivable!

Seven minutes after economic news there was a great trade, AAA+ (in my opinion!)  
  
Price .3279 or .3276, at resistance  
  
5': OB, **hidden divergence**  
1': Diverging, CCI exiting from -100 (@.3279)  
  
TP@Res .3290 or at round number  
  
Too bad i didn't took it, was relaxing (aka trading with real account on 1h ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1))  
  
P.S.: It seems that i'm talking to myself, please someone say something, there's the echo here ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

5': "Soft" divergence, leaving 100 CCI level  
1': Diverging, leaving OB  
  
SL@.3339, TP@CCI OS  
  
Will update, i'm having some problem with the trade plantform..  
  
**Update:** out with +6 pips (+0.6%)

You are not alone. Keep going, you are doing great. It does take practice. And it takes some analysis if a trade does not go your way. I have noticed that my mistakes were due to higher timeframe conflicts.

See, now that is brilliant. Porfirio, I am a programmer, and I understand that very clearly. If this - then that. The lights just came on.  
  
I was having issues with what I needed to see on higher timeframes... problem solved.

So, my analisys was this:  
  
Price @.3475  
  
15': "Continuation" divergence, hooking from extreme

University party?  
Wow so a great day, compliments to you!   
  
Yes, the M1 chart isn't a really relaxing one, but the trick is using at least two timeframes at once (5'/1').  
  
I need to review my MM, this evening i will work on something.  
  
BTW a divergence may be forming at 5' chart, take a look at it.

I don't think there should be an EA... there is a little thinking required.  
  
However, I will contribute this indicator I threw together; it has helped me quite a bit. I noticed that the divergence indicator that has been previously posted shows completed (past) divergences. That puts you behind the 8-ball so to speak when trying to catch divergences that are currently forming.  
  
So, what I wanted to do is find out when price is higher/lower than previous peaks/troughs but CCI does not follow, which would mean that there is a pending divergence.  
  
This indicator finds the previous peaks/troughs in price and then corresponds the CCI, and it looks at peaks/troughs in CCI and then corresponds with price. Because as you know peaks and troughs don't necessarily correspond with both.  
  
The indicator shows current CCI levels in all timeframes through Daily. If the reading is Green, CCI is up from previous bar. If the reading is Red, CCI is down from previous bar.  
  
NPD = no price divergence.  
NCD = no CCI divergence.  
  
L5 = last low is 5 bars ago (zero is current bar)  
H8 = last high is 8 bars ago (")  
  
It will tell you that there is a current pending bullish or bearish divergence for each timeframe, and for price and/or CCI.  
  
Check it out, there are more things I want to do with the indicator, but my time is limited.  
  
Please don't post any problems with the indicator to this thread.  
I don't want FC getting mad because the thread is cluttered with indicator non-sense.  
  
PM me.  
  
Thanks.  
  
PS. I know there is no alarm yet. I'm working on that.

Why to wait at the next CCI Top or Bottom Level, when the waves could give you a focus?  
  
So set a Pending Order (PO) (see #[**396**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5183609#post5183609)) and trade more efficient.

Hi porfirio  
An excellent conservative trading style! Marvellous!  
Often I am in the market before but at this level maybe I would go in the market once more plus (1/10).  
I think you have read the articles about CCI in this thread here and could make up your own trading style. Great!  
Well thougth out.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

I want to do one operation a day  
  
r: r m5 (20 pips approx) ... as stated above ... is not necessary that cci h1> = 0, but yes in m30 (a h1 stopped short, there will be amply out of 100 and will be pointing up or down) ... and go to m5, m15 we miss ... so everything will be even faster.  
  
in any case when I start downloading images  
  
I think not understood anything ... I should go to London to learn English

This was my analisys:  
  
15': OB  
5': OB, HFE  
1': OB, diverging, about to leave +100 CCI level  
  
The problem here is that the divergence was caused by the "pre-news fever", so isn't really reliable.. we'll see, hoverwere this isn't a great trade, it's probably better to pass on those ones.  
  
**Update** : Stopped out for a -1%.  
I Probably need to give more breath to the trades, looking forward to reenter

Price@.3498  
  
Will update soon  
  
**Update** : Price still diverging on 1', my stop is set at 1.3520, maybe i'll let this ride for a while (H1 30' 15' 5' are all OB, 15' HFE).  
**Update 2** : Trade closed at +18, but was probably better to close half size and let the rest run (suddently i enter the trade with half size, so i closed all the position)

little observations by me...  
  
i think we should not trade by M1 chart... its horrible... i think you had entered by M1 chart and that made you -1%.  
  
Hey stemeg, i think we should observe H4,H1,M30,M15 and M5 chart...  
  
M15 and M30 trigger makes better result i have seen so far...  
  
  
thanks

Hi mate.  
  
I'm tryign to use 1' to confirm the 5', not alone, so far it worked.  
But yeah, in the end you're not wrong, higher timeframes work simply better, and the trade is less stressful.  
  
I'm trying to organize the ideas in my mind, qill come out with something good i guess ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

Waiting for better market environment.  
My multiple time frame analysis tells me an absolute instable market situation. Maybe you could make some M1/M5 trials but the risk seems too high for me. The market seems on an extreme tight consolidation phase with no Volatility and no momentum. So I stay on the sideline and wait. The market environment seems to give no favored probability of making profits actual. So why trading? I'm waiting. Maybe tomorrow, maybe next monday. Next chance will come.

Ok, I have updated the indicator. I added weekly and monthly info. I know ForexCube likes to look at those...  
  
There is an alarm which you may turn on or off for each timeframe.  
Arrows will plot on the chart for each divergence alert for the bar it occurred (only for 1-min and 5-min right now).  
  
Arrows will only plot on the timeframe they occurred. So, if you switch timeframes, the arrows will not display on timeframes that they did not originally occur. Arrows will not go away once plotted.  
  
ForexCube, I will post the mq4, when my programming mess is cleaned up and I am satisfied that it works properly. That is just my pet peeve.  
  
Carl  
  
PS. Do not use this version. Found some bugs. Will upload v4 soon.

Yes, this method (i will not call it system) is golden, especially if used on higher time frames!  
  
Kudos to you for your trades, i got some connection issues and i missed the EU trade (15' diverging OB and 5' OB HFE), looking forward to another trade.  
  
I have a mini account opened, with something as 400 bucks inside, when i will anymore feel clumpsy trading this way i will switch account ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

note that there will be periods of major trends and great divergences in higher tf, so be sure to watch all the TF, as does forexcube

Version 4:  
\- Should be compatible with 4 and 5 digit crims.  
\- Individual Timeframe Alarms.  
\- Individual Timeframe Arrows.  
\- Minor bug fixes.  
  
Once the logic and bugs are squashed. I will add logic to find "PORFIRIO opportunities" in timeframe sets.

Ok i'm late calling this one, but i got some issues.  
Not an AAA trade as you see, but it worked well, got out with 7.x pips, could be 14.  
  
Price: .3506, high resistance area  
  
5': OB, hooking from extreme  
1': OB, diverging, CCI exiting form +100 level  
  
SL Over the top (10pips), TP@CCI OS.  
  
I got a problem with this trade, i don't know if it's my connection or the [Oanda](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile") plantform, but i didn't menage to enter at the right price, i got served at 6499 (7 pips less).  
I got problems in setting percentualized stop loss and take profits too with Oanda, but maybe that's just me.  
Here's the chart:

Thanks for your work Carl, about to download this one!  
  
Another good trade that i didn't take, 'cause i was away:  
  
Price@.3504  
  
15': OB  
5': OB  
1': Really marked hidden divergence, OB, HFE  
  
This was really good, 17 points if exit @ CCI OS on the 1', with less than 10 SL points, the whole moviment was of 37+ points.

Sorry, I have to update again.  
  
Fixed some more bugs.  
  
Thanks for the feedback.  
  
Future updates:  
\- Add Porfirio setups to timeframe sets.  
\- Add more lookback to CCI divergences (limited to 1 level now).  
\- Add hidden divergences (only normal found now).  
  
Carl

..You're sureley the best trader i ever "met", other than a really nice person!  
Another 8%, amazing.  
  
I see that you have a really high number of trades today, the majority on the EURUSD, will try to replicate them on my chart, so i'll learn more.  
  
Looking forward to read more of your posts ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Got a chance to test my new version 6...  
As I was testing out the new logic for Porfirio Setup, I got a hit for EURJPY for the H1-M15-M5 setup, especially when I saw the bear hammer show up.  
  
I know its late in the day, but I had a go of it.  
Worked out for a quick +10 pips in about 15 min.  
  
I have the indicator look for M15-M5-M1, H1-M15-M5 and H4-H1-M15 setups.  
  
Carl  
  
PS. Also added arrows for ALL timeframes. Couple more bug fixes. I have the default alarms on m5 and m15 with all timeframe arrows on.

Now I'm starting to see something interesting...  
  
Let my indicator run all day (like I have today, various versions).  
  
At the end of the day, look at all the timeframes. The arrows are drawn strictly using the normal divergence methodology, possible divergence.  
  
It is uncanny how CCI is a leading indicator when used this way.  
  
Amazing.  
  
I see what ForexCube sees as far as the power of CCI divergence. His trading results show that as well.

Hi SteMag  
This comment won't be a paternalism. It's an idea how I would trade a Mini Account. For me a well-engineered MM could be to trade 0.01 lot sizes at a 1'000.-$ Account (0.1 Lot with 10K and 1 Lot with 100K). Be aware that you trade in a higher risk modus when trading with a 400.- $ Deposit. For your guidance: Maybe a target could be 1% a Day, say 4.-$ with a 400.-$ Account. So you have to make 10 x 40 cents or 20 x 20 cents, by managing the Loss Orders additionally.   
  
In excellent market situations, e.g. near pivotals with a returning point (up or down via divergence at M5/M15) in conjunction with the higher time frame analysis (M30/H1/maybe H4) you could go in the market with several 0.01 Lot Orders (2 x 0.01 - 5 x 0.01) with various exit levels.  
Good Luck!![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Great design crodzilla!

ForexCube, I'll put it up tomorrow. I should have most of the bugs out, and I'll put more options to change colors.  
  
I need to finish this anyway, its time to trade!

Another one (sorry i'm late), +7 this time, but i think that this one could ride well.  
  
I've done a ton of examples of the method (hope they are allright), i'm sure that a detailed analysis is no more needed.  
If yes, just reply and tell me.  
  
SL@Top 7.5 pips, TP@CCI OB +7

yes Stegma  
I arrive late .... 10 pips should have come sooner than I did and would have closed and ... is still open, maybe take a few pips and I go because it has formed a stupid resistance in m5 near my tp

ForexCube and all,  
  
Attached is Version 7 of my indicator to help find CCI divergence set-ups.  
I think most bugs are gone. So I attach the .mq4 version for modification by anyone with the desire.  
  
I have commented the beginning of the .mq4 for my next "to do" modifications.  
  
And please, if you modify it, add a comment to the beginning of the .mq4 of what was changed. And change the version before posting. Thanks.  
  
Have fun, and lets make some money!!!

Well, right away I got a Porfirio setup. We have a possible CCI divergence in the m5, and EUR strength is divergent and USD strength is hooking down.  
  
Price is right at the Daily pivot, lets go long...

Started to get Bearish divergences on the m1, got out with 7-pips for just a few minutes.  
  
May have to jump back in here shortly. Looks like price may try to re-test the Daily pivot.  
  
EUR is weak still. This up move is based on USD weakness. Which means this upmove is suspect (weak).  
  
I would like to see USD weakness and EUR strength if I want to stick to a long bias.

There are long signals for the GBPUSD, but the GBP is so weak. I don't like to see divergences like this. No trades on GBPUSD, probably for the rest of day.

Here i am.  
So this trade was a great lesson to me.  
  
I entered at about 1.3485 because of an unconfirmed divergence from 5' TF (**BIG ERROR** , i was busy trading my real account), it wasn't OS.  
  
I entered with 1/4 position (20pips = <0.2% loss, so no big deal, Red line on the chart), and decided to hold and try to manage the loss, i thing that i never do in my real trading.  
My "hard" SL was the non-reaction to either the DPV level or the 5' CCI oversold.  
  
So the price suddently got down, .3470 first and then .3465, at the DPV.  
At 1.34635 i longed for another quarter (so half position total), same 1' candle that done a little spike on the CCI (in continous divergence) and touched DPV, with OS and continous divergence on 5' chart.  
  
The price reacted to the 1' divergence, start to climb to .3482.  
I closed both positions at about .34805 because of a divergence in 1' chart, with something as 5 pips profit.  
  
Richest 5 pips of the day, teaching wise ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

Hi crodzilla  
I see some MA's and other indicators at your chart. Looks very interesting. Could you explain some more about these indicators, please...? ...maybe to post your template and the other indicators also here at board! I suppose all these parameters could interact in a clever way and some of these ones could behave as (generate) confirmation signals in your CCI-Trading-System. Excellent!  
Best regards

Hi SteMag  
Make it simple and easy!  
M30/H1 was in the middle of the CCI Level (0), no top (+100 >) , no bottom (-100 >).  
Why not let the short run further downside. Moreover, M30 has build LL and LH (see the candles), so also H1. Try to use more the multiple time frame analysis (all time frames) when you trade the M1/M5.  
Kindest regards

****Multiple Time Frame Analysis****  
  
** What the heck is multiple time frame analysis?**  
  
Multi-time frame ana... WHAT?! Chill out young padawan, it ain't as complicated as it sounds! You're almost done with high school - now's not the time to get senioritis, although you probably got that way back in Grade 12. Ha!  
Multiple time frame analysis is simply the process of looking at the same pair and the same price, but on different time frames.   
Remember, a pair exists on several time frames - the daily, the hourly, the 15-minute, heck, even the 1-minute!   
This means that different traders can have their different opinions on how a pair is trading and both can be completely correct.  
Phoebe may see that EUR/USD is on a downtrend on the 4-hour chart. However, Sam trades on the 5-minute chart and sees that the pair just ranging up and down. And they could both be correct!  
As you can see, this poses a problem. Trades sometimes get confused when they look at the 4-hour, see that a sell signal, then they hop on the 1-hour and see price slowly moving up.   
What are you supposed to do?   
Stick with one time frame, take the signal and completely ignore the other time frame?   
Flip a coin to decide whether you should buy or sell?   
  
Luckily for you, we here at BabyPips.com aren't about to let you graduate without knowing how to use multiple time frame analysis to your advantage.   
First, we'll try to help you determine which time frame you should focus on. Each trader should trade a specific time frame that fits his or her own personality (more on this later).   
Secondly, we'll also teach you how to look at different time frames of the same currency pair to help you make better, more educated trading decisions.

****Trading Multiple Time****  
  
Most technical traders in the [foreign exchange](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forex.asp) market, whether they are novices or seasoned pros, have come across the concept of multiple time frame analysis in their market educations. However, this well-founded means of reading charts and developing strategies is often the first level of analysis to be forgotten when a trader pursues an edge over the market.   
  
In specializing as a day trader, momentum trader, [breakout trader](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/breakouttrader.asp) or event risk trader, among other styles, many market participants lose sight of the larger trend, miss clear levels of [support](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/support.asp) and [resistance](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/resistance.asp) and overlook high probability entry and stop levels. In this article, we will describe what multiple time frame analysis is and how to choose the various periods and how to put it all together. (For related reading, see _[Multiple Time Frames Can Multiply Returns](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/07/timeframes.asp)_.)  
  
**What Is Multiple Time-Frame Analysis?  
**Multiple time-frame analysis involves monitoring the same [currency pair](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currencypair.asp) across different frequencies (or time compressions). While there is no real limit as to how many frequencies can be monitored or which specific ones to choose, there are general guidelines that most practitioners will follow.   
  
Typically, using three different periods gives a broad enough reading on the market - using fewer than this can result in a considerable loss of data, while using more typically provides redundant analysis. When choosing the three time frequencies, a simple strategy can be to follow a "rule of four." This means that a medium-term period should first be determined and it should represent a standard as to how long the average trade is held. From there, a shorter term time frame should be chosen and it should be at least one-fourth the intermediate period (for example, a 15-minute chart for the short-term time frame and 60-minute chart for the medium or intermediate time frame). Through the same calculation, the long-term time frame should be at least four times greater than the intermediate one (so, keeping with the previous example, the 240-minute, or four-hour, chart would round out the three time frequencies).  
  
It is imperative to select the correct time frame when choosing the range of the three periods. Clearly, a long-term trader who holds positions for months will find little use for a 15-minute, 60-minute and 240-minute combination. At the same time, a day trader who holds positions for hours and rarely longer than a day would find little advantage in daily, weekly and monthly arrangements. This is not to say that the long-term trader would not benefit from keeping an eye on the 240-minute chart or the short-term trader from keeping a daily chart in the repertoire, but these should come at the extremes rather than anchoring the entire range.  
  
**Long-Term Time Frame  
**Equipped with the groundwork for describing multiple time frame analysis, it is now time to apply it to the forex market. With this method of studying charts, it is generally the best policy to start with the long-term time frame and work down to the more granular frequencies. By looking at the long-term time frame, the dominant trend is established. It is best to remember the most overused adage in trading for this frequency - "The trend is your friend." (For more on this topic, read _[Trading Trend Or Range?](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/05/050505.asp)_)  
  
Positions should not be executed on this wide angled chart, but the trades that are taken should be in the same direction as this frequency's trend is heading. This doesn't mean that trades can't be taken against the larger trend, but that those that are will likely have a lower probability of success and the profit target should be smaller than if it was heading in the direction of the overall trend.  
  
In the currency markets, when the long-term time frame has a daily, weekly or monthly periodicity, [fundamentals](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundamentals.asp) tend to have a significant impact on direction. Therefore, a trader should monitor the major economic trends when following the general trend on this time frame. Whether the primary economic concern is current account [deficits](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deficit.asp), consumer spending, business investment or any other number of influences, these developments should be monitored to better understand the direction in price action. At the same time, such dynamics tend to change infrequently, just as the trend in price on this time frame, so they need only be checked occasionally. (For related reading, see _[Fundamental Analysis For Traders](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/06/fundamentalapproach.asp)_.)  
  
Another consideration for a higher time frame in this range is the [interest rate](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp). Partially a reflection of an economy's health, the interest rate is a basic component in pricing exchange rates. Under most circumstances, capital will flow toward the currency with the higher rate in a pair as this equates to greater returns on investments.  
  
**Medium-Term Time Frame  
**Increasing the granularity of the same chart to the intermediate time frame, smaller moves within the broader trend become visible. This is the most versatile of the three frequencies because a sense of both the short-term and longer-term time frames can be obtained from this level. As we said above, the expected holding period for an average trade should define this anchor for the time frame range. In fact, this level should be the most frequently followed chart when planning a trade while the trade is on and as the position nears either its profit target or [stop loss](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stop-lossorder.asp). (To learn more, check out _[Devising A Medium-Term Forex Trading System](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/05/060205.asp)_.)   
  
**Short-Term Time Frame  
**Finally, trades should be executed on the short-term time frame. As the smaller fluctuations in price action become clearer, a trader is better able to pick an attractive entry for a position whose direction has already been defined by the higher frequency charts.   
  
Another consideration for this period is that fundamentals once again hold a heavy influence over price action in these charts, although in a very different way than they do for the higher time frame. Fundamental trends are no longer discernible when charts are below a four-hour frequency. Instead, the short-term time frame will respond with increased volatility to those indicators dubbed market moving. The more granular this lower time frame is, the bigger the reaction to [economic indicators](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economic_indicator.asp) will seem. Often, these sharp moves last for a very short time and, as such, are sometimes described as [noise](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/noise.asp). However, a trader will often avoid taking poor trades on these temporary imbalances as they monitor the progression of the other time frames. (Learn more about dealing with market noise, read _[Trading Without Noise](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/06/marketnoise.asp)_.)  
  
**Putting It All Together  
**When all three time frames are combined to evaluate a currency pair, a trader will easily improve the odds of success for a trade, regardless of the other rules applied for a strategy. Performing the [top-down](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/topdowninvesting.asp) analysis encourages trading with the larger trend. This alone lowers risk as there is a higher probability that price action will eventually continue on the longer trend. Applying this theory, the confidence level in a trade should be measured by how the time frames line up. For example, if the larger trend is to the upside but the medium- and short-term trends are heading lower, cautious shorts should be taken with reasonable profit targets and stops. Alternatively, a trader may wait until a bearish wave runs its course on the lower frequency charts and look to go long at a good level when the three time frames line up once again. (To learn more, read _[A Top-Down Approach To Investing](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/06/topdownapproach.asp)_.)  
  
Another clear benefit from incorporating multiple time frames into analyzing trades is the ability to identify support and resistance readings as well as strong entry and exit levels. A trade's chance of success improves when it is followed on a short-term chart because of the ability for a trader to avoid poor entry prices, ill-placed stops, and/or unreasonable targets.   
  
**Example  
**To put this theory into action, we will analyze the EUR/USD.  
  
**[http://i.investopedia.com/inv/articl...imeframes1.gif](http://i.investopedia.com/inv/articles/site/FX-timeframes1.gif)   
**Source: StockCharts.com Figure 1: Monthly frequency over a long-term (10-year) time frame.   
  
In Figure 1 a monthly frequency was chosen for the long-term time frame. It is clear from this chart that EUR/USD has been in an uptrend for a number of years. More precisely, the pair has formed a rather consistent rising trendline from a [swing low](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swinglow.asp) in late 2005. Over a few months, the spot pulled away from this trendline.  
  
[http://i.investopedia.com/inv/articl...imeframes2.gif](http://i.investopedia.com/inv/articles/site/FX-timeframes2.gif)  
Source: StockCharts.com Figure 2: A daily frequency over a medium-term time frame (one year).   
  
Moving down to the medium-term time frame, the general uptrend seen in the monthly chart is still identifiable. However, it is now evident that the spot price has broken a different, yet notable, rising trendline on this period and a [correction](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/correction.asp) back to the bigger trend may be underway. Taking this into consideration, a trade can be fleshed out. For the best chance at profit, a long position should only be considered when the price pulls back to the trendline on the long-term time frame. Another possible trade is to short the break of this medium-term trendline and set the profit target above the monthly chart's technical level.  
  
**[http://i.investopedia.com/inv/articl...imeframes3.gif](http://i.investopedia.com/inv/articles/site/FX-timeframes3.gif)   
**Source: StockCharts.com Figure 3: A short-term frequency (four hours) over a shorter time frame (40 days).   
  
Depending on what direction we take from the higher period charts, the lower time frame can better frame entry for a short or monitor the decline toward the major trendline. On the four-hour chart shown in Figure 3, a support level at 1.4525 has just recently fallen. Often, former support turns into new resistance (and vice versa) so a short limit entry order can be set just below this technical level and a stop can be placed above 1.4750 to ensure the trade's integrity should spot move up to test the new, short-term falling trend.**  
  
Conclusion  
**Using multiple time-frame analysis can drastically improve the odds of making a successful trade. Unfortunately, many traders ignore the usefulness of this technique once they start to find a specialized niche. As we've shown in this article, it may be time for many novice traders to revisit this method because it is a simple way to ensure that a position benefits from the direction of the underlying trend.

**Timeframe Analysis**  
  
This concept stands in between fundamental and technical analysis because it’s very important to both. Nevermind their differences, a technical analysts and fundamental analyst will still have to navigate multiple timeframes to decide which trades make sense, and which simply do not.  
  
**Multiple Timeframe Analysis**  
One element that we neglected in the tutorial for technical traders was the importance of multiple timeframes in decision making. Depending on which chart you’re reading, you might see a bullish signal, or you might see a bearish one.  
You see, in the short-term, a technical trader might spot an emerging bullish trend on the 15 minute candlestick charts. A technical analyst might see this:  
  
[](http://www.forexonlinelearning.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/multiple-timeframe-forex.gif)[http://www.forexonlinelearning.com/w...rame-forex.gif](http://www.forexonlinelearning.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/multiple-timeframe-forex.gif)  
  
That chart shows bullish strength, the RSI is south of 30, and a buy signal is confirmed with a candlestick pattern. But when we get the “big picture” view from a daily candlestick chart, we might just see that there is reason to go short:  
  
[](http://www.forexonlinelearning.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Multiple-timeframe-analysis.gif)[http://www.forexonlinelearning.com/w...e-analysis.gif](http://www.forexonlinelearning.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Multiple-timeframe-analysis.gif)  
  
See? In the big picture view, we’re seeing that the currency pair is primed for a short.  
  
**Fundamental Analysts and Timeframes**  
Fundamental analysts have to stay on top of multiple timeframes, too. In the short-term, it’s easy to make a very obvious case for a currency pair with a piece of news. Each month, the nonfarm payroll report is released to the market. This is better known as the US unemployment report, and we’ll discuss it in-depth later in our discussion on fundamental analysis.  
The non-farm payroll report might come out strong—more jobs might be added than expected, which is bullish for the US economy, and the US dollar. But does one month’s employment report really mean anything in the long-term?  
Traders have to dissect which information is actionable. Fundamental analysts could make 50 pips on a short-term short order on EUR/USD, making money when the US dollar rises against the Euro. But what will follow for the next month? What if this strong employment report is just one of many bad employment reports?  
Can the market really sustain a higher dollar price for the next three to six months?  
  
**The Types of Traders**  
In the coming section, we’ll discuss the many types of traders in the foreign exchange market. Some trade the short-term, intra-day movements in currencies. Some trade intra-month, holding a currency pair for only a few weeks. Others, though, trade for the long-term, buying and selling based on many months of data.  
What excites an intra-day trader probably won’t even register for the long-term investor. The opposite is also true. The elements that bring the long term investor into a trade are likely not at all exciting to the day trader.

** **Multiple Time Frame Analysis for Forex, Futures, and Stock Traders  
  
**In our last lesson we learned about support and resistance and how to spot these levels in the market. We should now have a good understanding of how to spot trends in the market, some of the components that make up those trends, and finally how to recognize support and resistance levels. Now lets tie everything together we have learned thus far with the final concept of this series, Multi Time frame analysis.   
  
No matter what time frame you end up using when trading the stock, futures or forex market or what time frame a particular trading strategy calls for, it is important always to have a big picture overview of what is happening in the market. Although there are exceptions, in general most traders will tell you that if your trade setup or analysis lines up on multiple time frames, then the odds of being correct are greatly increased.   
  
Lets look at a simple example by looking for a trade to place to take advantage of a trend that we have spotted on a chart. For this example lets say we are looking at a 5 minute chart of the EUR/USD.

[http://www.aboutcurrency.com/images/...rusd_chart.jpg](http://www.aboutcurrency.com/images/university/fxvideocourse/5min_eurusd_chart.jpg)

  
As you can see from the above chart if we were just looking at the EUR/USD 5 minute chart then we would note the downtrend in the market and sticking to the simple strategy of simply following the trend, we would look for opportunities to sell into the downtrend.  
  
As we want to have a better feeling for the general direction of the market however when we place this trade we next take a look at an hourly chart.  
  
**1 Hour EUR/USD Chart:**  

[http://www.aboutcurrency.com/images/...rusd_chart.jpg](http://www.aboutcurrency.com/images/university/fxvideocourse/1hour_eurusd_chart.jpg)

  
As we can see from this chart we also spot a longer term downtrend on the hourly chart thus giving us more confidence in our potential trade into the downtrend on the 5 minute chart.  
  
Lastly to make sure that we are getting the full picture we pull up a daily chart.  
  
**Daily EUR/USD Chart:  
**  

[http://www.aboutcurrency.com/images/...rusd_chart.jpg](http://www.aboutcurrency.com/images/university/fxvideocourse/daily_eurusd_chart.jpg)

  
When looking at this chart however we see that not only is the EUR/USD in an uptrend on the daily chart, it is in an extended uptrend. As the daily chart does not line up with the 5 minute and the hourly chart we may want to question whether or not to place the suggested downtrend trade in the face of the large uptrend on the longer term chart.  
  
Now that we understand how a trading signal in the stock, futures, or forex market can be considered “stronger” if it lines up on multiple time frames, a more prudent way to search for potential trades may be to start by looking at the longer term time frames, and then look for opportunities on shorter term charts which are in line with what the longer term charts are showing.  
  
The same concept applies when looking at support and resistance. In general the more time frames and the longer the time frame is that a support or resistance level shows up on the more “valid” that level is considered.  
  
That’s our lesson for today. You should now have a good understanding of multiple time frame analysis and how looking at different time frames can give us more or less confidence in trades we are considering making.  
  
In our next lesson we are going to start a new series with an introduction to forex, futures, and stock market chart patterns and the double top and double bottom pattern.

Hi mate! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Thanks for your response, i will try to act like you say.  
The problem is that i feel a little clumpsy at trading with multiple time frames now by now, and i'm prone to do stupid errors, and sometimes i'm too concentrated looking the shorter time frames that i miss the 30'/1h/4h.  
I need another week or two to make more pratice, but i feel that i'm getting better day after day!  
  
I saw all the stuff you've posted: good work!  
I will patiently study all the posts tomorrow, look like they are really interesting.   
  
Thanks for your efforts, looking forward to hear you again.   
Good trading,  
Stefano  
  
EDIT:  
  
Glad to hear that you're a jazz appraiser too, Petrucciani was simply great!

I'm starting to get nervous here, econ news coming out in 25' and 55', don't really like to be around when it happens.  
  
My error in this trade (bad error, don't know why i done it) is that i didn't enter with the remaining size @.3446, second 5' divergence with 1' in continous divergence.

**Update** : Got in with another quarter at .3448 (was too slow for the 50!)  
Superior TFs all shows OB, some HFE.

Still sitting here, cannot close the 2nd part of the trade @ BE because of that FIFO rule, so i will stay in and face the news.  
The theorical loss is not a big deal, so that is not a problem, and i'll give a little space to breath.  
I'm a bit sorry because the trade could be managed better, but i guess we're here to learn, and this one is giving me a good lesson.  
  
  
Chart-wise the situation calls short with convinction, let's see if the upcoming news will mess something.  
  
I feel really alone here, please someone say something ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

Hi mate.. good job!! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
I wasn't trading at the time of the first long.  
  
I'm still in the second part of the short, floating from positive to negative back and forth.  
  
Funny thing is that i usually scalp with this method, and today there were a lot of opportunities.. and i'm hanging there with this trade..

TAYSAC-System  
This simple & effective TASAYC-System appropriates only the Pivotals and the CCI-Indicator and some Trends-Lines sometimes. You could learn how to incorporate these technical indicators into your analysis to improve your trading decisions. You can put more things into it if you like. The Multiple-Time-Frame-Analyse keeps you out of bad trades as well as keeps you from over trading.

M1: CCI Bottom Divergence > Long  
M5: CCI Bottom > Long  
M15: -   
M30: CCI Middle Line - down (~0) > Short  
H1: CCI Middle Line - down (~0) > Short  
H4: CCI Middle Line - up (~0) > Long  
Daily: CCI Middle Line - up (~0) > Long  
  
The Daily Candle seems also too small and could go in both direction today.  
  
Conclusion:   
Unstable Market Situation.   
Wait for a better market entry probability.  
I would preferre to trade at M1/M5 with regards at higher time frames and with regard to H4 would set a PO Short @ 1.35.

Great mate!  
  
I've closed the second operation at +20 with hard TP (sorry for late but i was at lunch).  
  
A really strange operation was this, probably i should risk a bit more after the 5' triple cci divergence + 1' divergence, scalp or not trade at all around the news time.  
  
Will problably be out for the next hour or so.

Devo rileggermi bene il tutto perche'non mi e'chiaro il multiframe

Not the smartest thing to do, but tried a little scalp @.3450lvl, OS+litle divergence on 5' and marked divergence on 1'.  
  
SL is 0.25%  
  
**Update** : As nothing said, trade closed at BE 'cause of 1' CCI OS.  
Will probably wait for a 15' OS, or a clearer divergence on the 5' chart.

When the market seems for me unstable (see #[**509**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5194619#post5194619)) I like to summarize trades like in the charts below. Waiting for an abrupt price movement at a higher timeframe with regard to the Pivotals. Enter in the market with some orders and go with several out of the market by switching at a lower time frame (in this example below M30 > M1).

Sorry Astock, didn't read you.  
FIFO means First In-First Out, it's a rule implemented by NFA.  
In pratical speaking: if you open a trade on a pair while another is already open you cannot close the newer first.  
  
H1 still diverging:

thanks, i understand now. i have a demo account at [oanda](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile") \- means i have to take care about this rule - can make closing an order in a tricky situation a bit complicated.  
do you know - does every broker has this fifo rule??

No mate, i think that only US-based brokers use the FIFO rule.  
  
I've traded with alot of banks and brokers with live accounts (i'm in the EU), today was my first encounter with the FIFO ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)  
  
BTW still in, stop @.3505 (1%).  
  
Was thinking about it: last week i was scalping, fast in and outs, and i got a nice profit.  
Why for the hell today i'm struggling with those slow and stressful trades?!

As everyday there are _tons_ of good scalping occasion on 5'/1'.  
  
I'm still in the previous trade, floating at +2 now.  
  
**update** : My stoploss is set at BE+1  
  
Hiden bullish divergence on 5' time frame, not a good sing.  
  
I go out now, see you soon.

Hi FXC!  
  
If you mind and have time: how do you manage the eventual losing positions?

Problably, in my situation (training and demoing), a good and right analysis is better than an huge profit. Probably.  
But i really don't have words about it, so i will only post the chart:

See #[**522**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5195500#post5195500)  
  
Hi SteMag  
  
Sure i will explain it. It's more complex and needs some lessons which I will post this week here and there.   
  
Maybe we should call it LOM (Loss Order Management).  
  
See at first #[**526**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5196055#post5196055) , please.

LOM - 1 Step  
Loss Order Management  
Fragmentation  
When you go in the market with 1 Lot so cut this 1 Lot into pieces, say 10 x 0.1 Lot Sizes.   
When you trade normally 0.1 Lot so reduce to small pieces 10 x 0.01 Lot.  
  
To do so has several benefits.   
(A) You could go in with one (or several) 1/10 order(s) more and moreover when the price will turn in the counterpart direction.  
(B) You could set your Stop Loss not so tight by giving the market its breath.  
(C) The market signalizes different options of making a profit. Some Price Levels perform a higher probability. Not every market situation "promise" the same profit. So it's absolutely stupid to go in the market every time with the same Lot Sizes.  
(D) When you don't have the time to monitor the market, you could set different input and output levels, dependent at which time frame you will go in and out of the market. (e.g. see #[**523**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5196024#post5196024) the green highlighted trades. The exit levels were set based on different Pivotals or so).

LOM - 2 Step  
Loss Order Management  
Right Calculation - Profit per Day  
  
When I set the target of 1% Profit per Day, so I have to earn an infinite deal more, e.g. 1.5%, 2% or 3% every day.  
  
These trades are balanced out the losses.  
  
Today I have earn a profit of 7% (see #[**523**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5196024#post5196024)), so I have 6% for the war chest.   
This could give an area of freedom. This psychological momentum could be advantageous to traders who don't like to be stressed when they trade the forex market.

Tried a little long @.3339 (41 incl. spread), will update  
  
**Update** : Considering my yesterday experience (all day trading HI TF ops and getting a very little profit) i decided to close the operation @ 12/14 points ('1 OB) to cash some money, for >0.25%.  
  
BUT the pair has a great long potential, considering the high TFs.

Different Risk Accounts  
  
When I have make more money with my "Low Risk Accounts" (Target 1%) and all Loss Orders are counterbalanced, I put sometimes some money out of this account and take it into a "High Risk Account" (Target: doubling in a short time). It's important for me that I declare it as a separate account, due to the fact that this account could also be produce a 50% drawdown. This kind of trading implies high stress level trading. I don't like it all the time but here and there in the meantime of my normal trading session at any time.

Hi kader  
  
(1) Stop loss is dependand at the timeframe at which you order your trades. M5 trades needs a tighter stop loss then H4 trades or daily trades.  
(2) Stop Loss is dependant at your lot sizes, which you invest in your entry order. My entries have 1/10 of my normal entries. So I could set the stop loss theoretical 10 times far away.  
(3) Stop Loss is dependant on your winning versus loosing trades.  
  
At first I would minimize the "lot sizes", say if you go normally in a trade with 1 Lot so enter with 0.1 at first or several 0.1s (3 x 0.1 or so). If you trade with 0.1 Lot sizes normally and you couldn't go in with 0.01 lot sizes change the broker and open a mini account and try it there with 0.01 lot per trade.  
  
It's better when you post some real trading examples here (entry, TP-Level, stop loss) at this board and others (and I) could give you their (our) feedbacks.  
  
I can set my stop loss far away at the next pivotal points or two pivotal levels ago or 25 points above the last daily Low or High concerning my one-tenth and I make fewer losses in this way, because 95% of all these trades will turn in the winning zone sooner or later; - so why to kill it with the feeble-minded 2% rules before? There's no sense for me! When worse comes to worse you could hedge some of these ones. Think about it!  
  
Maybe take a look at:  
<http://www.forex-money-management.com/stop_loss/02/>  
  
We're all here to learn from each other.  
  
Kindest regards

In the Forex literature you could read often something like this:  
"Just how big should a stop loss be? The most common method of setting a stop loss is based on the size what you expect to gain. You should never you a stop loss of less than 2:1. Meaning, that what you stand to profit from the trade should be twice as large as what you are prepared to lose, or the size of your stop loss. Going any smaller than a 2:1 risk reward ratio will ultimately blow your account in the long run".  
  
This is absolutely bullsh*t!  
  
Work out your own parameters, which fits you!  
  
I like also to trade short, shorter, shortest (Scalping). My trades needs only a profit, absolutely independant how much it is! When you make 20-100 winning trades per day (net) it adds up and at the end of the day you have earn maybe 1%, maybe 5%. This applies to mini profits per day (e.g. 0.2%) also.   
  
Kindest regards

what i saw there is 5+pip take profit.... but no stop loss set!!!!   
  
i understand what you mean by pivot level stop and others.  
  
But should not we put stop loss when we open a scalping entry ???  
  
i went through th link... i do the same exactly./..... i put my stop to the last low or high and their 5 pips away/.///....  
  
and i set stop to the recent pivot level...  
  
or according to the RISK REWARD...   
  
pivot suits me better,.,,, that's what i am doing...

Hi kader  
  
Hahahah![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f923.png?v=15.1)  
  
Your investment style shouldn't be a copy from my trading style. Maybe we have other cognitions, another personality, other psychology, another risk tolerance, another,..other.,, another so many aspects.... Your job could be to translate all these aspects which you could read at this thread and at other threads in your own way and work it out. Maybe you will make more profit per day than I or other one of these days.

I hedge loss positions frequently instead of setting a stop loss most of the time and I open a new account when the old one has doubled or tripled (100% or 200% win). So it could be not a misfortune for me when one or two accounts per year could incur a complete loss (ordinarily the High Risk Accounts). At the end of the month/year you should stay in a clear profit. Then you could quit one's job and could live by selling one's property, if you could like this way of life. I don't know.

yes, of course,..., but daily and monthly could go down, so not the best trade for Long. I would say it's more an "unstable market situation" and it could be better to wait for an entry with higher probabilites of making a profit!  
If you would trade this shorter time anyway then maybe with a regard of overlapping H1/H4 candles and set a stop loss below these candles. But I wouldn't trade this market situation. Too much uncertain, ...and if it did only with a few pips (~2-5 pips) with accumulative 1/10 orders.

i knew it bro...  
  
but i never lost those trade with at least 3 time frame confirmation. yes i can see the market situation is too uncertain.. specially in higher time frame like H4/H1 or D1.  
  
but this is another short trade with tight stop and small target.  
  
yes i am lucky this time. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

You mean "Long at 1.55661" (not 1.5661), because 1.5661 was a great deal for down, (see the daily chart, please)!

Hi  
  
When you hedge a loss position after how many pips (in loss) you open a hedge position.I would love to learn some trick about hedge position, I know it's not ideal way of trading but still knowing to protect your loss position is great.  
Thanks

Hi magicpips  
  
You could follow it in the published trades in the future. Basically my hedging strategy is dynamical! It depends at my multiple time frame analysis, at the time frame level where orders will be executed and at my risk tolerance and of the quantity of 1/10 in the market orders, say all the same where other traders would set a stop loss. You could set an hedging order, when your stop loss is reached with regard at higher time frames if there could be a real chance that the market price could turn around in the winning zone. Setting an Hedging Order is closely-linked with the higher time frame analysis. Apart from that it make no sense!  
Kindest regards

Hello crodzilla!  
...and take a look at the M30/H1 candles. They are upstairs.  
  
Could be a good possibility to trade M1/M5 down just now.

Hi crodzilla  
Thank you for this marvellous indicator!  
That's really nice.   
I have met other programmers who want to make his business solely with this CCI-concept!

You are welcome.  
  
I'm finalizing/testing the next version which has longer lookback for cci divergence and the triagularMA filter.  
I love how this indicator alerts to the next possible divergence, ahead of time !!!  
This concept is truly a gold mine for traders... seems we are a small group yet... I don't mind.  
  
I traded a little today, then on to programming...

> In the Forex literature you could read often something like this:  
>  "Just how big should a stop loss be? The most common method of setting a stop loss is based on the size what you expect to gain. You should never you a stop loss of less than 2:1. Meaning, that what you stand to profit from the trade should be twice as large as what you are prepared to lose, or the size of your stop loss. Going any smaller than a 2:1 risk reward ratio will ultimately blow your account in the long run".

This trade example might refer central to the aspect of your risk tolerance and how professional traders are able to analyze a market situation (here after NY Market Close).

Hi Landsat  
As an advanced level trader I have make the experience that I have to wait as far as a market situation augur well around the clock. When you will make pips, ...no doubt, ... at the most during the open market sessions (London Open, NY Open).

**Trading Sessions**  
  
Now that you know **what** forex is, **why** you should trade it, and **who** makes up the forex market, it's about time you learned **when** you can trade.   
Yes, it is true that the forex market is open 24 hours a day, but that doesn't mean it's always active the whole day.  
You can make money trading when the market moves up, and you can even make money when the market moves down.   
**BUT** you will have a very difficult time trying to make money when the market doesn't move at all.  
And believe us, there will be times when the market is as still as the victims of Medusa. This lesson will help determine when the best times of the day are to trade.   
  
**Market Hours**  
  
[http://babypips.cachefly.net/school/...hool/clock.png](http://babypips.cachefly.net/school/images/pre-school/clock.png) Before looking at the best times to trade, we must look at what a 24-hour day in the forex world looks like.   
The forex market can be broken up into four major trading sessions: the Sydney session, the Tokyo session, the London session, and [Pipcrawler's](http://www.babypips.com/blogs/pick-of-the-day/) favorite time to trade, the New York session. Below are tables of the open and close times for each session:  
  
_See the frame below, please._  
  
You can see that in between each session, there is a period of time where two sessions are open at the same time. From 3:00-4:00 am EDT, the [Tokyo session](http://www.babypips.com/school/tokyo-session.html) and [London session](http://www.babypips.com/school/london-session.html) overlap, and from 8:00-12:00 am EDT, the London session and the [New York](http://www.babypips.com/school/new-york-session.html) session overlap.   
Naturally, these are the busiest times during the trading day because there is more volume when two markets are open at the same time. This makes sense because during those times, all the market participants are wheelin' and dealin', which means that more money is transferring hands.   
  
Now, you're probably looking at the Sydney open and thinking why it shifts two hours. You'd think that Sydney's open would only move one hour when the U.S. adjusts for standard time, but remember that when the U.S. shifts one hour back, Sydney actually moves forward by one hour (seasons are opposite in [Australia](http://www.babypips.com/school/australia.html)). You should always remember this if you ever plan to trade during that time period.  
Let's take a look at the average pip movement of the major currency pairs during each trading session.

From the table, you will see that the European session normally provides the most movement.  
Let's take a more in depth look at each of the session, as well as those periods when the sessions overlap.

Manually but I have seen scripts at the Internet which could make it automatically. The problem could be the various [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") of the brokers and the other sneaky MT4 Broker tricks and so I will see life which orders are triggered.

Hi FXcube,  
  
I have been reading your thread the last couple days, good information on CCI!  
I just have a question do you typically trade from one pivot to next based on the CCI position for entry? By your trade logs you open a quite alot of positions.  
  
  
Thanks Mike

Hi meanpips  
Yes, this is one trading technique which I use at (M5/M15/H1) besides the scalping ones (M1) only for several pips (1-8 pips). At H4 & Daily I trade more sectors of the pivotal levels.   
Kindest regards

Hi magicpips  
Of course, upload this "THV Trix Indicator" at this thread and give a link (...I see just done), please and make your experiences. Find your way of trading. The target of this thread is that you,...everybody...have to work out your your/his own CCI-Trading-System, which fits best for you!  
  
..and upload some trading examples, with frames and explanation, please, that all here could follow your idea, please!  
  
Note:  
Upload without exception the *.mq4-file, please at this thread, please (not the *.ex4 files where nobody could read the code, and no *zip-files). If there are only *.ex4 then make a link, please and unzip the *.zip-files, please, before uploading and test it with a virus scanner.  
  
Best regards

Stop Loss -Yes or No?  
  
Abrupt price movements within a range is a reason for me to trade without a stop loss most of the time or put the Stop Loss far away.

**Trading Forex Without Stop-Loss?**  
November 22nd, 2010   
  
Stop-loss is one of the best invention of the financial trading. At the same time it’s also one of the most cursed thing in Forex — how many times was your stop-loss hit just before the trend reversed in the direction of your position? For many traders stop-loss orders are the reason of depression and despair. Unfortunately, not many of them understand that if they didn’t use stop-loss the results would have been even worse.   
Recently, I’ve stumbled upon a ”strategy” promoted by some Nigerian trader on one forum. His idea was quite simple — sell USD/JPY on some pivotal levels and don’t set up a stop-loss. His argument — if you have enough margin you can lose only if USD/JPY goes down to 0.00. In his opinion it’s about 8,300 pips now or if you trade 1 mini lot it’s $1/pip, or $8,300 margin required, which is quite normal for a standard Forex account of $10,000. The problem is that for 1 mini lot of USD/JPY 1 pip isn’t equal to $1 — it depends on the current USD/JPY rate. Using the [pip value calculator](http://www.earnforex.com/pip-value-calculator) you can easily see how 1 pip value grows as the USD/JPY rate declines; for example, at USD/JPY = 40.00, 1 mini lot pip is $2.50. Of course, such a huge decline on USD/JPY is improbable, but trading without stop-loss you always risk **huge** to earn **small** , which eventually eradicates your capital.

**Forex Trading Secrets - No Stop Loss Strategies**  
Written by: [Steve McFarlane](http://www.brighthub.com/members/salus.aspx) • Edited by: [Laurie Patsalides](http://www.brighthub.com/members/lauriepatsalides.aspx)   
Updated Apr 21, 2011 • Related Guides: [Money Management](http://www.brighthub.com/guides/money-management.aspx)   
  
In this article we look at some of the strategies that can used to trade Forex without a stop loss. The effect of leveraging and trend following are also highlighted as factors that can affect the success of a day trader.  
  
One of the secrets to trading Forex successfully is to strictly follow an effective money management strategy. For many Forex traders that means using stop losses. Unfortunately, those very same stop losses are often responsible for the failure of most day traders, especially when stop losses are tightly set. There is nothing more frustrating than having a stop loss close a trade that would have gone on to be profitable.  
  
**Buy and Hold for Currency Traders**  
Trading the currency market is much like trading stocks. Despite the similarities between the Forex and stock market, most Forex traders don’t bother to employ the trading strategies that equities traders have proved over time, such as the buy and hold rule. Warren Buffet will tell you that the only way to consistently make money in the stock market is to buy shares and hold them, at least until the fundamentals change. However, good traders don’t just enter trades based on the results of some cursory technical analysis. Good traders must be satisfied that the underlying economic, fiscal and financial factors will support their trading decision.  
  
**Be a Trend Follower**  
The long-term direction of a currency pair is often determined by the economic fundamentals and Geo-political realities of the country in question. These fundamentals might include the interest rate policy of the central bank, balance of payments numbers and the government's general political stance, to name a few. If a country’s economy is doing well and there are no extenuating matters, then its currency should appreciate against currencies with weaker economies.  
Doing fundamental analysis like this gives a trader a long-term outlook on a currency and affords him the luxury of not taking multiple small losses, such as those that occur when tight stop losses are used. All he has to do is await for pullbacks to go long on the currency. If a trade goes negative, it can do so to a greater degree than would be possible if high leveraging was used.  
However, there are exceptions to this rule. If a correction is imminent, it might be prudent to take a small loss by exiting previously negative trades and reverse positions to take advantage of the changing trend.  
  
**Trading with No Stop Loss - Profit Protection Strategies**  
Stop losses don’t only exist to prevent losses but can also be used to protect profits; a good example of this is a trailing stop-loss. A trailing stop can be used to protect profits that are already on the table; this is best done when the trade has made substantial gains, and then a trailing stop can be put between the entry point and the current price action. This allows for the current price movement to continue, just in case the market will give more profits, while at the same time ensuring that the trade in question won't lose money for the trader. A ‘limit order’ can also be used to exit parts of a trade when a pullback is expected but the market has not yet hit the profit targets. In order to avoid making large losses, many traders use tight stop-losses, but this often results in multiple small losses that can quickly add up and ruin a trading account. Often, trades that start out badly eventually become profitable, if the trade is just given some time.

**  
The Long****and Short of It**  
Is it possible to trade successfully with no stop loss? The short answer is yes, but for this strategy to work, traders must only trade in the direction of the trend, avoid using leveraging/margin facilities and be bullish only on currencies that are fundamentally strong. The buy and hold strategy is not popular among currency traders, and it will never be as long as Forex brokers offer high leveraging on Forex trading accounts and traders take the bait. While the use of margin can accelerate the growth of a trading account, it is also a double-edged sword that can cause a margin call if things get out-of-hand.

[Stop Loss?? I Don't Want To Use It](http://www.actionforex.com/articles-library/forex-articles/stop-loss%3f%3f-i-don%27t-want-to-use-it-2007102930810/)   
Forex Articles|Written by IFTC Financial Studies|  
  
Stop Loss?? I Don't Want To Use It  
Last week I was reviewing a website which has a trading signal program for those investors who prefer to not being involved in confusing market analysis and I respect them because such services normally will bring them more time to do other important things in their daily life. But the interesting thing was the most of signalers did not actually place a stop loss point on their recommendations. Is that so because they know they are right all the time? Or that's because they did not lose half of their trading account in an unexpected slump of 200 hundred points and a single trade.  
However, the answer is most of them have something between -1000 to -5000 pips of open trades on their signal board and they actually trapped in desperately while they could cut the losing trades and ran another one instead. Also I should mention that there are some other types of system trading that called "Hedge Fund" and I don't actually want to argue if they are right or wrong. I am definitely talking to day traders who get into challenge with big bear every day.   
Sometimes, I don't understand why a trader could be convinced of not having a Stop Loss while we see almost every month an unexpected uncounted impulse (I would call it Best of the Test for whom with less of the rest) in the market.  
There is no specific rule as to where you should place the stop loss, so consider the below mentioned tips as the general rules and ask your mentor to fit reliable Stop loss rules just for you and your trading system(If you have one?).

  1. Many loser traders do place the same stop loss for all the trades they execute without even trying to measure market environment.
  2. Don't be scared of placing a stop loss while it is for your gain and you must know what your profit objective is.
  3. Stop Loss should not be too close to the current price while most of the stop loss enemies have ruined their trading accounts already just by using very close ones.
  4. Stop Loss should not be too far from the point you get into trade while it's better to not placing any Stop Loss rather taking an unreachable, fictional protector.
  5. Try to not to risk more than the points of your profit goal. Pro traders recommend to only take those trades which have at least 2 points of potential profit per 1 pip of potential lose, but I would say it is completely depends on the money management system that you use, as different money management systems has different recommendations for Risk & Reward.
  6. Sometimes a trading system does not work if you risk less than recommended %7 to %10 of your total account balance. It means you trade oversize or you just entered the market when everyone else getting out of the market. In this case this is not your fault as it has a clear message for you "don't trade this way anymore and ask an expert to solve the problem".
  7. If you are convinced enough that you can make up 1 million dollar out of your 10000 dollars account by not using stop losses as you may think you are the one who knows the price will be back on its way to you instead of hitting new highs, well, simply you are wrong.
  8. Remember, there are no sky limits for the price of any of currencies in FOREX market.
  9. If you don't like to place a pre defined Stop Loss on your trades, please ask someone to show you how to follow a wining trade by using "Trailing Stop".
  10. Be sure it is better to have one or two losing trades with 100 points of lose, instead of being desperate with sinking into -1000 pips of dizziness.

**How to Define the Best Stop Loss point?**  
Try these tools to define the most accurate stop loss points easily:

  1. Use 10 pips over/below the first Parabolic SAR spot(dot) appeared over/below the price candles for Short/Long Trades.  
Note#1: Remember you just can use 10 pips above the parabolic SAR dots as an Stop Loss point when you have a Short trade and Vice Versa.
  2. Note#2: You realized that the Stop Loss obtained from SAR is too far from the point which you want to enter the market. OK, this means you are about to enter the market very late so better to not do it.
  3. Use 10 pips over/below the day before yesterday's HIGH and LOW and in the case of the market has moved a lot far, use 10 pips over/below the yesterday HIGH and LOW as a Stop Loss point for your Short/Long trades.
  4. Use two Moving Averages of 55 EMA and 144 MA. You may place your stop loss just 10 pips below/above one of those two MAs depending on how do you set up the profit/loss game for your Long/Short trades.  
Note#: If you trade on the range market break out be aware of this kind of Stop Loss setting, and it is quite safer to use another way.
  5. Place the Stop Loss 10 pips over/below Bollinger Bands Upper/Lower band for Short/Long trades.
  6. If you use Elliot Waves theory to analyze the market:  
# Place the Stop Loss just 10 pips below the lowest point of the Second (2) wave in bullish trend when you LONG on Wave 3.   
# places the Stop Loss 10 pips below the lowest point of the 4th Wave when you go for LONG on 5th Wave.   
# Place the Stop Loss right above/below the top/low of the previous wave when you go for SHORT/LONG based on A-B-C correctional waves.

Notes:

  1. Aforementioned suggestions are based on 4Hours chart.
  2. Those ways of defining Stop Loss points has worked for me, but It does not necessarily works for you, so ask your mentor or an expert friend to do evaluate the probability of fitting those suggestions to your trading strategy.
  3. 10 pips are because sometimes price hit the important support or resistance levels by more than a touch.
  4. Please don't forget, the Stop Loss issue is not actually a game. It is not even an option for you; it is a "MUST" and will save you when you can do nothing, so refresh your mind in this case.

Hi Robst3r!  
  
Yes, for sure!  
  
Be aware:  
Sometimes Daily is stronger than H4, H4 could be stronger than H1, H1 could be stronger than H1,..and so on. When? At all market environments where a breakout could appear and if there are any trending or ranging markets,... and so on. This is the reason why I make also a Multiple Time Frame Analysis and select the charts which could be make a good or might be a better profit! I like H4 trading very much but not at this time where all european political decisions fail and flop in the euro crisis.  
  
Kindest regards  
FXcube

EURUSD, M30, 2011 December 07  
EURUSD, H1, 2011 December 07  
  
Hi Porfirio,  
  
...maybe you could explain, please, why your indicator point out a "Sell Setup Option" just now.  
  
The CCI-M30 and the CCI-H1 are moving in the middle Line around 0.00 at my chart which could mean an unstable market situation.  
In this market environments I could take the risk over with some M1/M5 Orders short term only for several pips in anticipation that the market could be consolidate for a certain shorter time. Then we could see a struggling price around this Pivotal DPV 1.3387.  
Thank you.

long day!  
  
out of home! so No trade!  
  
according to the post no 597 and 599.  
  
i have something to say... i donno if i am right or wrong/.///  
  
i do believe stop loss is must. as i am a day trader with small investment stop loss always keep me safe and give me strength to move to the next trade.  
  
There is no limitation of any move! it can grow up more than 200 pips in just 5 min! so if you had no stop loss what would you do ??? this is the worst question i found no positive answer.  
  
And about Hedge to defend loss ? i tried and asked many expert. they just found nothing. Hedging needs Huge funds, and need deep observation full time of the market. Most can't do it....   
  
But Using Stop loss without money management and time frame concern is just B*****T....  
  
There are many way to use stops. just need to find a way that suits better,  
  
I found money management and last low and last high price a better option for using stops.   
  
i believe if one has a good trading strategy and better market observation skill, it is just a matter of putting stops as formerly. No Worries there using stops...  
  
Before i found this thread i had no idea how to observe overall market condition looking at higher time frames. i had 50-60% success rate.   
Now i can see how its moving and when should i make a move. i had no loss in last 1 week. but i did not forget to use stop. i am really afraid of market bounce :'(  
  
i need to practice more. until i make my demo account double i will keep demoing.  
  
Thanks a lot FXcube to introduce me to the real forex world.

Still testing and tweeking the new version.  
  
-Added 3 levels of cci lookback, to check for divergence.  
-Added the TriangularMA indicator for overbought/oversold filtering.  
-Removed price divergence (wasn't really part of Forexcube method).  
  
Trying to trade which programming... (don't try this at home).  
EU strength was weakening as price was running up.  
USD has a divergence.  
Price at pivot.

Ok, this indicator is getting quite complicated, but it has helped me see what ForexCube sees. So, hopefully this will help others as well.  
  
**My Personal Addition:**  
I have added the triangularMA code into this indicator to better see where tops & bottoms may occur. Another nice feature is it also tells you which timeframe is in a range as well. I'll post some pics following this.  
  
Many changes and additions. Read the header of the code for the summary.  
-Added option to lookback further (peaks/troughs) in cci for divergences, up to 3 levels.

So, here are two examples in different timeframes showing what the TriangularMA does, when 2 of them with different settings are placed on the chart.  
  
Keep in mind these settings seem to work on ANY timeframe with ANY currency pair.  
  
The two settings are:  
  
HalfLength = 50  
BandsDeviation = 1.75  
  
HalfLength = 14  
BandsDeviation = 2.0  
  
So, whenever the shorter term high band moves over the longer term high band, price is in a good position for a short reversal.  
  
Look at what happens to CCI almost every time that happens... CCI divergence.  
  
Look at opposite situation for buying.  
  
Have fun, and be profitable!  
  
Carl

it is as easy as using others... Just run it on your chart... wait for better confirmation signal (at least 3 time frame confirmations!.  
  
i hope i am right.  
  
BTW! it will also show you arrow...

Hi Carl!  
  
Really awesome work, as usual, thumbs up for you!  
  
Just a little note for the traders out there, i really hope you don't get upset if i say it: beware that, for the nature of it's "triangular" calculation (Google it), the TMA repaints in a very hard way, so if you want test something do it in forward test, not in backtest.  
  
Keep it up!

Yes, you are absolutely right, it does repaint. But, because it calculates a standard deviation of prices, and then centers it around an STD MA envelope, its kind of like a smooth version of Bollinger Bands, but it repaints.  
  
Buy using the shorter standard deviation against a longer standard deviation, I was hoping to find the short-term spikes in price, that theoretically should return to the norm.

Not necessarily. You still have to do the higher/lower timeframe analysis as put forth by ForexCube.  
  
I can't look at it too closely right now, but, the arrows are only alerts to POSSIBLE entries.  
  
I personally wait for the Porfirio setups to occur. You will see a message and alarm for those.

See #[**621**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5203361#post5203361)  
  
Hi wallstreet  
  
CCI-M5 and CCI-M30 are at the Top (100 >). 1/10 is the order size.  
Why only 1/10? H1 and H4 seems to be in an upward movement (~0). Why to trade this market situation then? Daily shows indifferent candles in the last days (Range) and I can go in the market with more Sell Orders at every Pivotal Level (1/10) if the market price would go further up.  
  
1/10 orders are adapted to my CCI-Trading Style and Stop Loss Management.

I'm not really in long term trading (not SO long term), but for what i can see, that you have not listed, there is an hidden bullish divergence in daily timeframe.  
BUT as you see 1w volatility is shrinked, and CCI is clearly working against any idea of long here.  
If i were in your shoes i'll wait for more clearness before setting up a long term operation, just my 2 cents.

Gaussian-distribution-wise your idea is good!  
I pointed out the repaint issue (in reality is not even an issue) just for the "not really experienced" traders out there.  
I've your TMAs on my main chart, will take a look at them live following days!  
  
If i can give you an advice about your indicator: is perfect this way, but maybe in next version you could add some cosmethic options.  
I was thinking about an option to relocate it (from one corner of the chart to another), one to choose which timeframes display and another to change the size of the text.  
  
As usual, thanks for your efforts!!

Hi only1kader  
I trade without stop loss most of the time and my money management could tolerate between 500-1'000 negative pips, based on the 1/10 orders with the result that the success rate is around 95-98%.   
That is what I want to point out. Traders who follow the 2% Stop Loss rule or something like that could only have a success rate about 50-60%. So they will lose the day as time drew on.  
I wish you good Luck!  
Kindest regards  
FXcube

EURUSD, M5, 2011 December 08  
EURUSD, M30, 2011 December 08  
  
Trade Example  
  
For what reason making a Multiple Time Frame Analysis?  
Explanation - Example 1  
  
M5: Trading only the M5 you could execute following trades:  
P1 (Long), P2 (Long), P3 (Exit & Short), P4 (Short), P5 (Short), P6 (Exit & Long), P7 (Exit & Short), P8 (Short), P9 (Exit & Long), P10 (Long), P11 (Exit & Short), P12 (Exit & Long)  
  
If you will wait as far as all trades are in the winning zone, then P3 (Short) and P4 (Short) are running still in the market in the speculation that the market price will coming more down.  
  
M30: With regard to M30 there was no value for taking P3 (Short), P4 (Short) & P5 (Short) for the simple reason that the market price were running in a clear upward trend with a strong momentum and a high volatility (see "M30 Upwards Channel").  
  
The lesson is clear: With "MTFA" you could increase your profit! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
I wish you Green Pips!

Forexcube, would it be useful if we could set an alarm on a certain timeframe (like M30), if CCI peaks over 100/200 then moves down, or CCI troughs under -100/-200 then moves up?  
  
I was pondering that strategy of the M30/M5 EURUSD trades.  
  
Or would that just be overkill?

Hi Carl!  
Thank you for your kindly words!  
Oh yes of course, M30 is excellent for M1/M5 traders, maybe added H1.  
  
"Overkill" could be for me more an aspect which time frame you intend to trade M1/M5 with regard to M15/M30/H1, maybe H4?,... or H1/H4 with a view to Daily & Weekly,..or Daily by overlooking the Weekly & Monthly?  
  
To set alarms at M15, M30 when trading M1/M5 could be a benefit, specially during London and NY session!  
Kindest regards

He means entering the market with just 1/10 of his standard lot size.  
So if his normal size is 2 lots, he will enter with 0.2 lots if he enters 1/10, 0.4 if 2/10 etc.  
Written in the first post i guess.

This was an easy one.  
  
If you look closely you can see a good candle formation on hourly, and CCI overbought doing that little "plateau" (really don't know how to call it), and your stop loss was really small (20pips for next pivot level + 10 if i remember), 30' and 15' were in divergence.. so this was a go for me ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Ultimately, we should not try to predict which direction price will break from triangle chart patterns.

**Triangle Chart Patterns Trading on Mt4**  
  
**Triangle chart patterns** are the most traded chart pattern in currency trading. There are three types of triangles most traded in currency trading:  
  
**Triangle Chart Patterns**  
  
•symmetrical triangles  
•ascending triangles  
•descending triangles  
  
**Triangle Chart Patterns are Easy to Identify on Forex Charts**  
  
  
[http://www.forexgeometry.com/wp-cont...ns-300x229.jpg](http://www.forexgeometry.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/triangle-chart-patterns-300x229.jpg)  
  
Identifying _triangle chart patterns_ is easy when a complete technical analysis has been carried out. Locate 2 higher highs and 2 lower lows. Next, draw a line through them. Join at least 2 lower lows with one line, and 2 higher highs with another line, and you’ll have a nice triangle chart pattern. You have just identified a trade-able chart patterns most traded in forex trading. A minimum of four ‘bounces’ should be observed before this triangle formation can be considered a reliable pattern to trade with.  
Research by Thomas Bulkowski and many famous technicians indicate that price often breaks out of the symmetrical triangle ahead of the price at which the 2 trendlines converge, which is labelled the apex. From the point where the triangle begins, research shows that most triangles break out of either the upper or lower trendline anywhere from the 66 percent and 75 percent of the way to the apex, though some triangles break out at the apex.  
An important Caveat on Directional Biases  
There is one major caveat to know when working with _triangle chart patterns_. In most technical analysis books, it is found that ascending triangles are described as bullish continuation patterns and descending triangles are described as bearish continuation patterns. From our experience, if you classify triangle chart patterns as such, you are doing a disservice to yourself.  
Ultimately, we should not try to predict which direction price will break from triangle chart patterns. That’s not to say that ascending triangles cannot meet their upside breakout targets or that descending triangles will not break to the downside targets. They do.  
However, when thinking of these triangle chart patterns in terms of risk/reward and edge, it’s best to treat them without directional bias and take advantage of the principle of range expansion following range contraction instead of the complexity of trying to predict which direction price will break-out.  
In fact, you will likely find that some of the best trades will come from triangle chart patterns that break opposite of their expected directional bias. This is because traders who think that ascending triangles will -always break to the upside will be forced to sell their forex contracts as they stop-out when the ascending triangle breaks unexpectedly to the downside, and these traders stoping out, when combined with sellers entering new short-sale positions as a result of the confirmed triangle chart pattern entry will create a positive feedback loop that propels price to achieve the unexpected downside target. Knowing this is a major benefit when anticipating where or how to enter a potential triangle trade.  
As such, we should use trendline-break EA found on MT4 to draw not just a buy pending order on a ascending triangle chart pattern, but also sell a pending order on the chart pattern as well. When breakout happens either to the upside or downside, the trader can participate on the breakout regardless of its direction. This process of placing buy and sell pending orders on triangle chart patterns can now be automated by commercialized software or robots.  
In regard to where are best to enter trades in triangle chart patterns, we turn back to conservative versus aggressive tactics. An aggressive trader would put on a position immediately as price begins to break above the upper trendline or beneath the lower trendline without waiting for further confirmation signal. Conservative traders have a variety of entry strategies, including entering only as price breaks above a strong bullish breakout candle like a bullish engulfing or beneath a strong bearish candle.  
Thanks to technology, there are commercial robots programmed specially for traders to trade triangle chart patterns on automation. Whether the trader trades aggressively or conservatively, entry based on trendline-breakout or price breaks and closes beyond trend line, each of these style of trading can be personalized and programmed to work in the absence of the trader at the computer screen.  
  
**Reducing False Breakouts Trading Triangle Chart Patterns**  
A time filter can be introduced to reduce the possibility of false triangle break-outs outside the specified trading time frame. Generally, most genuine breakouts happen during active Forex trading hours and 30 minutes after the opening bell of the market session.  
Another way is to introduce indicators like ADX and to factor in the ADX values before considering whether to trade breakouts or to fade breakouts. Reducing the likelihood of the false breakout, I will like to see that the ADX is below 15 value for some time. And the longer it stays below 15, it will mean that market is attempting and preparing for a big movement. It will be a very good opportunity to trade triangle chart patterns.  
**Warren Seah** What if you just couldn’t trade forex effectively with a day time job? I know how hard it can be to trade forex manually, but if you want to really be successfully trading your own unique manual system, you need to learn a single method that works amazingly well.  
Don’t give up hope, it’s NOT impossible. [Triangle Chart Patterns](http://www.forexgeometry.com/) will expand your trading capabilities to greater trading success learn more by clicking the link above.

[Forex trading articles](http://www.forexfloor.com/forex-trading-articles.html)**Forex Trading Trend Patterns - The Symmetrical Triangle**  
  
A symmetrical triangle is a Forex trading continuation pattern that occurs in the middle of an [uptrend or a downtrend](http://www.forexfloor.com/trading-trends.html) is already in progress. In this [Forex trading tutorial](http://www.forexfloor.com/) we will teach you the steps needed to recognize symmetrical triangles :

  1. \- First, a symmetrical triangle starts with a change in the direction of currency price. If the currency followed an uptrend then the triangle will start to drop.
  2. \- Next, the currency rapidly changes direction, with steep rises and drops.

Which makes a symmetrical triangle is that the rises and drops become shorter and shorter, thus forming a sort of triangle. The currency price start with large rises and drops, and converges into a point, that is also the tip of the triangle. After the tip of the triangle is formed, the Forex trading trend that preceded the symmetrical triangle is continued. This is why it is called a Forex trading continuation pattern. If you draw two lines on the edges of the rapid rises and drops, they will form a symmetrical triangle with the same sides, which is also names am Isosceles.

**Triangles**  
  
**Symmetrical Triangle**  
A symmetrical triangle is a chart formation where the slope of the price's highs and the slope of the price's lows converge together to a point where it looks like a triangle.   
What's happening during this formation is that the market is making lower highs and higher lows. This means that neither the buyers nor the sellers are pushing the price far enough to make a clear trend.   
If this were a battle between the buyers and sellers, then this would be a draw.   
This is also a type of consolidation.   
  
[http://babypips.cachefly.net/school/...gle-before.png](http://babypips.cachefly.net/school/images/grade7/symmetrical-triangle-before.png)   
  
In the chart above, we can see that neither the buyers nor the sellers could push the price in their direction. When this happens we get lower highs and higher lows.   
As these two slopes get closer to each other, it means that a breakout is getting near. We don't know what direction the breakout will be, but we do know that the market will **most likely** break out. Eventually, one side of the market will give in.   
So how can we take advantage of this?   
Simple.   
We can place entry orders above the slope of the lower highs and below the slope of the higher lows. Since we already know that the price is going to break out, we can just hitch a ride in whatever direction the market moves.   
  
[http://babypips.cachefly.net/school/...ngle-after.png](http://babypips.cachefly.net/school/images/grade7/symmetrical-triangle-after.png)   
  
In this example, if we placed an entry order above the slope of the lower highs, we would've been taken along for a nice ride up.  
If you had placed another entry order below the slope of the higher lows, then you would cancel it as soon as the first order was hit.

So, trade closed.  
  
It was really a speculation, i entered that one 'cause i NEED to do bad trades (demoing is for that imho).  
  
Closed the trade @BE, because  
  
1- Was a bad trade (oh really?!)  
2- Bad reaction on DPV level  
3- Really awful candle formation  
  
Here's the chart:

**Ascending Triangle**  
This type of formation occurs when there is a resistance level and a slope of higher lows.   
What happens during this time is that there is a certain level that the buyers cannot seem to exceed. However, they are gradually starting to push the price up as evident by the higher lows.  
  
[http://babypips.cachefly.net/school/...gle-before.png](http://babypips.cachefly.net/school/images/grade7/ascending-triangle-before.png)   
  
In the chart above, you can see that the buyers are starting to gain strength because they are making higher lows. They keep putting pressure on that resistance level and as a result, a breakout is bound to happen.   
Now the question is, "Which direction will it go? Will the buyers be able to break that level or will the resistance be too strong?"   
Many charting books will tell you that in most cases, the buyers will win this battle and the price will break out past the resistance.  
However, it has been our experience that this is not always the case. Sometimes the resistance level is too strong, and there is simply not enough buying power to push it through.   
Most of the time, the price will in fact go up. The point we are trying to make is that you should not be obsessed with which direction the price goes, but you should be ready for movement in EITHER direction.   
In this case, we would set an entry order above the resistance line and below the slope of the higher lows.  
  
[http://babypips.cachefly.net/school/...ngle-after.png](http://babypips.cachefly.net/school/images/grade7/ascending-triangle-after.png)   
  
In this scenario, the buyers lost the battle and the price proceeded to dive! You can see that the drop was approximately the same distance as the height of the triangle formation.   
If we set our short order below the bottom of the triangle, we could've caught some pips off that dive.   
  
**Descending Triangle**  
As you probably guessed, descending triangles are the exact opposite of ascending triangles (we knew you were smart!). In descending triangles, there is a string of lower highs which forms the upper line. The lower line is a support level in which the price cannot seem to break.  
  
[http://babypips.cachefly.net/school/...gle-before.png](http://babypips.cachefly.net/school/images/grade7/descending-triangle-before.png)   
  
In the chart above, you can see that the price is gradually making lower highs which tell us that the sellers are starting to gain some ground against the buyers.   
Now most of the time, and we do say MOST, the price will eventually break the support line and continue to fall.   
However, in some cases the support line will be too strong, and the price will bounce off of it and make a strong move up.   
The good news is that we don't care where the price goes. We just know that it's about to go somewhere. In this case, we would place entry orders above the upper line (the lower highs) and below the support line.   
  
[http://babypips.cachefly.net/school/...ngle-after.png](http://babypips.cachefly.net/school/images/grade7/descending-triangle-after.png)  
  
In this case, the price ended up breaking above the top of the triangle. After the upside breakout, it proceeded to surge higher, by around the same vertical distance as the height of the triangle.   
Placing an entry order above the top of the triangle and going for a target as high as the height of the formation would've yielded nice profits.

Thanks mate.  
  
Yeah with that layout you will not turn blind like a mole: you have your main chart on the left (5' or whatever you want), you could do rapid check on the others, and if you need to look closely you could simply enlarge one of the little ones.. really simple, but it took me a while to organize this way.

**Forex Trend Continuation: The Triangle Patterns**  
  
The **triangle continuation patterns** resemble pennants, but don't have poles. Forex technical analysis distinguishes four types of triangles: 

  1. Symmetrical
  2. Ascending
  3. Descending
  4. Expanding (also known as broadening)

**Symmetrical Triangle Continuation Pattern**  
The symmetrical and converging descending resistance line and ascending support line form the symmetrical triangle. It is framed by at least four significant points. A balance between supply and demand on the forex market is implied by the symmetrically converging resistance and support lines. The currency price bounces between them until a break on one of the sides occurs.   
  
[http://www.forex-trading-gurus.com/a...l-triangle.gif](http://www.forex-trading-gurus.com/assets/images/symmetrical-triangle.gif)  
  
Under the conditions of a downward, bearish trend, traders should look for a break below the rising support line, whereas under bullish trend conditions, the focus should be on the break above the declining resistance line. However, in order to qualify this formation as a continuation pattern, a break in the same direction of the preceding trend should occur. Otherwise, the pattern will signal the forming of a new trend.   
The ambivalence of the forex market is implied by the decrease in the trading volume as the end of the triangle is reached. However, an increase in volume accompanies the breakout.   
  
**Ascending Triangle Bullish Pattern**  
The ascending triangle formation is a bullish pattern, which indicates that the preceding upward price movement is headed even higher upon completion. This triangle pattern implies that the demand is larger than the supply.   
Two trendlines form the ascending triangle pattern: a flat resistance line and an ascending support line. Forex market traders can expect that the currency price will break on the upside, above the level of resistance. This is the point when the pattern is considered complete. If, however, the price falls below the support line, the pattern is broken.   
  
[http://www.forex-trading-gurus.com/a...g-triangle.gif](http://www.forex-trading-gurus.com/assets/images/ascending-and-descending-triangle.gif)  
  
**Descending Triangle Bearish Pattern**  
The descending triangle formation is a bearish pattern, indicating that the preceding downward price movement is headed lower upon completion. By analogy with the ascending triangle, the descending triangle pattern is considered to be a trend continuation pattern when it is preceded by a downward trend; however, it can be found in an uptrend. Under this triangle pattern it is assumed that the demand is less than the supply.   
This chart pattern is formed by a flat support line and a descending resistance line. Additionally, forex market traders look for a currency break on the downside and resuming of the bearish trend.   
Even though trading volume decreases toward the tip of the triangle, starting from the breakout it steeply increases.   
  
**Expanding Triangle Continuation Pattern**  
  
[http://www.forex-trading-gurus.com/a...g-triangle.gif](http://www.forex-trading-gurus.com/assets/images/expanding-triangle.gif)   
  
This type of triangle pattern is also known as the Megaphone. Two divergent trendlines form the triangle and its tip is right next to the original trend. Volume increases with the development of the chart formation.

Mate i hope you don't get angry because of my note, but in my opinion in that article you have posted the buy/sell points aren't in the right position.  
So, you **could** buy and sell at the triangle breakout if you're late with the trade, but the ideal entry level (always in my opinion) is the lower ascending/descending support level, as highlighted red in this picture:

In this way you could have a smaller stop-loss (or bigger size), and a bigger profit.  
  
Be careful today, there are a lot of econ news incoming, the ECB conference and the Bank stress test result at 18:00 GMT+1.  
See you later!

here is my trading plan:  
  
divergence trading:  
1)if you see a divergence in 15m, check 5min for divergence as well  
2)if you see a divergence in 30m, check 15min for divergence, and check 5min for divergence  
*always enter at 5min divergence   
  
scalping in 5m:  
those oversold overbought zone   
(i have no idea how Fxc does it)   
  
*1min is just too fast for me to trade, so im staying out of that tf.  
any comments would be appreciated!  
  
Regards,

Got into this trade.  
  
Lil risky because only 1' and 5' are diverging, higher TFs are only OS.  
  
Sorry guys but i'm really in hurry.  
  
**Update** : Out with +5, i must exit, see you later.

..Too much economic news/events today, it's dangerous to trade in my opinion.  
  
I was in this long trade (mobile), too bad i close before the e/u Minimum bid rate news, banked only 7 pips.

Really don't know how you do it.  
  
Maybe one time or another if you want you could post those trades on a chart, you do it by moving the trades (mouse button pressed) from the list to the chart.  
It's a really visual way to show the trades.

really don't understand how you do it!!! i am surprised......  
  
  
don't you ever lose any trade ????????? i mean don't you close any trade in loss ??/?  
  
as we can see you did not use any stop loss.  
  
so if you are wrong in your observation... trade gone against you... what would you do ? hedge ??

Hello Forexcube.  
  
It seems that market has i,ncreased right after you open short at 1.3423 to 1,3459. So what i dont understand, your stops are too large? Even in 5M.   
  
Can you check you entrances and exits on graph please.  
  
K.Rgds. 

Good Hunting!

@forexcube, i see on your accountstatement you havent no loss trade, congratulations.  
  
my question to you: you never put a S/L and only sometimes a T/P, so how you control yur trades? when you start to close a trade, if he ie running in a loss? you look for some signals or make a stop mentally, only from your experience??

So, I found ForexCube's m5/m30 strategy very interesting and decided to stress-test it today on EURUSD. Yes, there is news today, but lets just see...  
  
So, I saw the M30 CCI below -200 and start back up.  
So, I went to the M5, and it too was looking like diverging instances were occurring.  
I started buying (legging-in 1/10's) at strategic and not-so-strategic positions.  
  
When the M5 CCI hit 100, I found that there were 15 pips profit adding up all my positions, winners and losers. Yes, I did take losses, but I'm not as good as ForexCube.  
  
There may be hope for me yet!

I go out with a loss or I hedge this position several times at different time frames if it could be a good chance to do it.

Hi Arokh Dark  
Yes indeed! Feel free to set your orders by yourself! See p.1, #1. I don't have a crystall ball neither That's the reason why I trade fragmented 1/10 orders. This has one benefit more: I don't have to set the Stop Loss too tight and can go in the market several more times with 1/10 when the market has moved in the counterpart direction. My philosophy: I will let the market its breath. Pivotal Points could function as a landmark.

Hi astock!  
The control based over the 1/10-order-concept. Most traders are undercapitalized. One or two things are experience.   
Loss Orders are monitored at higher time frames and should be hedged at different time frames several times.

Hi SteMag  
  
I don't understand you twofold.   
  
First  
All what I have post here are trades which I have also make in life trading. If you compare the demo account, you could recognize similar events. Look at it! Entry, Exits,... you could see all at my frames. What's your problem!  
  
Second  
_"...by moving the trades (mouse button pressed) from the list to the chart...."_  
No can do. Can you give an example on your chart, please.  
  
Your statement seems for me misleading!

Second  
_"...by moving the trades (mouse button pressed) from the list to the chart...."_  
No can do. Can you give an example on your chart, please.  
  
Hope I can help. I believe what SteMag means is that you can show your closed trades on your charts by clicking on "account history", find the trade in question, left click on that trade and holding the left button down drag in onto your chart. At least on my metatrader platform it works like a charm. Make sure the chart and trade matchup. It should show entry and exit.. don't know about non-metatrader platforms. It may not work on your charts.

Hello FXcube,  
  
I think what SteMag is trying to say is that he just can't understand how your trading logs show you never have any losers. I think he is just envious of your trading skills, and just take it as a compliment! You show your trade charts on how you enter the market, just my take anyway. Thanks for all the information.  
  
Good trading Mike

to All of you  
  
This is it ..........forexcube try to explain that basically when it comes to Trading System the signal itself is meaningless ....but the Money Management is much more important , especially the psychology part ......everyone here can spot divergence on CCI even my son of 12 years can understand but which one here can click knowing that the system works without SL ...who got the guts to open the order ??? only the real traders....this is the difference between loosers and winners...i know that this post will make some of you angry ,,, but wake up to reality this the essence of trading yourself qlone fighting against yourself nothing else...the one who complain the most about the MM here are the one in fact who understand very well there is no SL but can't take it as a part of trading system ...and i think is the most important part in this thread...  
  
you have the right to disagree ....i m not trying to convice you , i just give my point of view .....

Hi FXC!  
  
Mate maybe you're thinking too hard ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
I obviously wasn't putting in doubt your trading, and nor your statements, i admire you and your trading technique, that's clear.  
Was only pointing out the possibility of show visually the trades in a chart, with low-to-no effort, and on 1' chart you could have an amazing "detail".  
Replicate the trades from a list can be tricky, just think about the difference between two people's timezones, the difference between one person's timezone and broker's one, the way MT4 manages partial closed trades on a list etc.  
You do it, because you need to, but sometimes can be a really heavy thing, espcially when the trade lists are long!

Hi danc  
You don't need the stoch when you have the CCI. You could make it more simple! CCI is more stable and gives better reliable values.  
Kindest regards

Oh sorry. This is a great misunderstanding. I have try to draw the orders from the "Trade" (this doesn't function) not from the "Account History" into the chart. Really great. It goes well! Great idea!![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Thank you crodzilla!  
  
Seems a good aspect for trading the Daily Range.  
I take the risk over with:  
  
Long @ 1.5616 mS1 (1/10), Target @ 1.5723   
  
...maybe once more, when the market should turn further down.  
PO Long @ 1.5403 (S3) (1/10), Target @ 1.60

If it holds above 5620 (call option level), I'll try to trail all my orders, and let 'em ride.

Please read and understand this thread. You must do multi-timeframe analysis with CCI divergence trading. The down arrows are POTENTIAL cci divergence areas in that timeframe ONLY. You must do more analysis in higher/lower timeframes to decide if you want to enter the market or not.

Hi astock  
Do you have the "123PatternV6"- Indicator there? If so it's that!  
The other option could be crodzilla's marvellous indicator.   
Thank you crodzilla!

Yup I'm out of all my GBPUSD trades for 25 pips. Can't watch to close any more today.  
I was going to trail, but, I'll just keep what I've got. And I see that hidden bearish divergence.  
  
That was fun!! Perfect setup.  
  
Thanks Forexcube.

Forexcube  
  
let say if you have to define 3 levels of risks ( level A level B level C) level A being the highest level of Risk.  
maximum leverage given by your broker is 50:1  
what will be the % of leverage that you will use for :  
level A ?  
level B ?  
level C ?  
  
i dont put number because i know my risk tolerance , i ask you because when you talk about high risk account i just would to know the leverage that you are using.  
for me will be 100%at level A so equal to 50:1.  
  
thank's one more time for your guidance

Last trade, it went 19pips in red before start falling, got 27pips.  
  
Higher TFs were ranging, so i wasn't relaxed, and for the same reason i didn't open another short at the second (top) divergence.

Hi Landsat  
Your question?, ...I think, ...it is not the case! A Risk definition should be more complex!  
Read the articles: "Understanding Forex Risk Management" (#[**737**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5211864#post5211864)), "Forex Risk" (#[**738**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5211869#post5211869) ), "Forex Scalping: A High Risk Strategy" (#[**739**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5211876#post5211876)), "High Risk Investment" (#[**740**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5211879#post5211879)), High or Low Risk Rate" (#[**741**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5211889#post5211889)) please.

**Understanding Forex Risk Management**  
  
Trading is the exchange of goods or services between two or more parties. So if you need gasoline for your car, then you would trade your dollars for gasoline. In the old days, and still in some societies, trading was done by [barter](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/barter.asp), where one commodity was swapped for another. A trade may have gone like this: Person A will fix Person B's broken window in exchange for a basket of apples from Person B's tree. This is a practical, easy to manage, day-to-day example of making a trade, with relatively easy management of risk. In order to lessen the risk, Person A might ask Person B to show his apples, to make sure they are good to eat, before fixing the window. This is how trading has been for millennia: a practical, thoughtful human process.  
  
**This is Now**  
Now enter the world wide web and all of a sudden risk can become completely out of control, in part due to the speed at which a transaction can take place. In fact, the speed of the transaction, the instant gratification and the adrenalin rush of making a profit in less than 60 seconds can often trigger a gambling instinct, to which many traders may succumb. Hence, they might turn to online trading as a form of gambling rather than approaching trading as a professional business that requires proper speculative habits. (Learn more in [_Are You Investing Or Gambling?_](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/10/investing-or-gambling.asp))  
  
Speculating as a trader is not gambling. The difference between gambling and speculating is risk management. In other words, with speculating, you have some kind of control over your risk, whereas with gambling you don't. Even a card game such as Poker can be played with either the mindset of a gambler or with the mindset of a speculator, usually with totally different outcomes.  
  
**Betting Strategies  
**There are three basic ways to take a bet: [Martingale](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/martingalesystem.asp), [anti-Martingale](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/antimartingale.asp) or speculative. Speculation comes from the Latin word "speculari," meaning to spy out or look forward.  
  
In a Martingale strategy, you would double-up your bet each time you lose, and hope that eventually the losing streak will end and you will make a favorable bet, thereby recovering all your losses and even making a small profit.  
  
Using an anti-Martingale strategy, you would halve your bets each time you lost, but would double your bets each time you won. This theory assumes that you can capitalize on a winning streak and profit accordingly. Clearly, for online traders, this is the better of the two strategies to adopt. It is always less risky to take your losses quickly and add or increase your trade size when you are winning.  
However, no trade should be taken without first stacking the odds in your favor, and if this is not clearly possible then no trade should be taken at all. (For more on the Martingale method, read [_FX Trading The Martingale Way_](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/06/martingale.asp).)  
  
**Know the Odds**  
So, the first rule in risk management is to calculate the odds of your trade being successful. To do that, you need to grasp both fundamental and [technical analysis](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalanalysis.asp). You will need to understand the dynamics of the market in which you are trading, and also know where the likely psychological price trigger points are, which a price chart can help you decide.  
Once a decision is made to take the trade then the next most important factor is in how you control or manage the risk. Remember, if you can measure the risk, you can, for the most part, manage it.  
In stacking the odds in your favor, it is important to draw a line in the sand, which will be your cut out point if the market trades to that level. The difference between this cut-out point and where you enter the market is your risk. Psychologically, you must accept this risk upfront before you even take the trade. If you can accept the potential loss, and you are OK with it, then you can consider the trade further. If the loss will be too much for you to bear, then you must not take the trade or else you will be severely stressed and unable to be objective as your trade proceeds.  
Since risk is the opposite side of the coin to reward, you should draw a second line in the sand, which is where, if the market trades to that point, you will move your original cut-out line to secure your position. This is known as sliding your stops. This second line is the price at which you break even if the market cuts you out at that point. Once you are protected by a break-even stop, your risk has virtually been reduced to zero, as long as the market is very liquid and you know your trade will be executed at that price. Make sure you understand the difference between stop orders, limit orders and market orders.  
  
**Liquidity  
**The next risk factor to study is [liquidity](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp). Liquidity means that there are a sufficient number of buyers and sellers at current prices to easily and efficiently take your trade. In the case of the forex markets, liquidity, at least in the major currencies, is never a problem. This liquidity is known as market liquidity, and in the spot cash forex market, it accounts for some $2 trillion per day in trading volume.  
However, this liquidity is not necessarily available to all brokers and is not the same in all currency pairs. It is really the broker liquidity that will affect you as a trader. Unless you trade directly with a large forex dealing bank, you most likely will need to rely on an online broker to hold your account and to execute your trades accordingly. Questions relating to broker risk are beyond the scope of this article, but large, well-known and well capitalized brokers should be fine for most retail online traders, at least in terms of having sufficient liquidity to effectively execute your trade.  
  
**Risk per Trade  
**Another aspect of risk is determined by how much trading capital you have available. Risk per trade should always be a small percentage of your total capital. A good starting percentage could be 2% of your available trading capital. So, for example, if you have $5000 in your account, the maximum loss allowable should be no more than 2%. With these parameters your maximum loss would be $100 per trade. A 2% loss per trade would mean you can be wrong 50 times in a row before you wipe out your account. This is an unlikely scenario if you have a proper system for stacking the odds in your favor.   
So how do we actually measure the risk?  
  
The way to measure risk per trade is by using your price chart. This is best demonstrated by looking at a chart as follows:   
[http://i.investopedia.com/inv/articl.../RiskMGMT1.gif](http://i.investopedia.com/inv/articles/site/RiskMGMT1.gif)   
Figure 1: EUR/USD One-Hour Time Frame Chart by Netdania.com   
  
We have already determined that our first line in the sand ([stop loss](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stop-lossorder.asp)) should be drawn where we would cut out of the position if the market traded to this level. The line is set at 1.3534. To give the market a little room, I would set the stop loss to 1.3530. (Learn more about stop losses in _[The Art Of Selling A Losing Position](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/02/022002.asp)._) A good place to enter the position would be at 1.3580, which, in this example, is just above the high of the hourly close after a an attempt to form a triple bottom failed. The difference between this entry point and the exit point is therefore 50 pips. If you are trading with $5,000 in your account, you would limit your loss to the 2% of your trading capital, which is $100.  
Let's assume you are trading [mini lots](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mini-lot.asp). If one pip in a mini lot is equal to approximately $1 and your risk is 50 pips then, for each lot you trade, you are risking $50. You could trade one or two mini lots and keep your risk to between $50-100. You should not trade more than three mini lots in this example, if you do not wish to violate your 2% rule.  
  
**Leverage  
**The next big risk magnifier is [leverage](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverage.asp). Leverage is the use of the bank's or broker's money rather than the strict use of your own. The spot forex market is a very leveraged market, in that you could put down a deposit of just $1,000 to actually trade $100,000. This is a 100:1 leverage factor. A one pip loss in a 100:1 leveraged situation is equal to $10. So if you had 10 mini lots in the trade, and you lost 50 pips, your loss would be $500, not $50.  
However, one of the big benefits of trading the spot forex markets is the availability of high leverage. This high leverage is available because the market is so liquid that it is easy to cut out of a position very quickly and, therefore, easier compared with most other markets to manage leveraged positions. Leverage of course cuts two ways. If you are leveraged and you make a profit, your returns are magnified very quickly but, in the converse, losses will erode your account just as quickly too. (See _[Leverage's "Double-Edged Sword" Need Not Cut Deep](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/08/forex-leverage.asp)_ for more.)  
But of all the risks inherent in a trade, the hardest risk to manage, and by far the most common risk blamed for trader loss, is the bad habit patterns of the trader himself.  
All traders have to take responsibility for their own decisions. In trading, losses are part of the norm, so a trader must learn to accept losses as part of the process. Losses are not failures. However, not taking a loss quickly is a failure of proper trade management. Usually a trader, when his position moves into a loss, will second guess his system and wait for the loss to turn around and for the position to become profitable. This is fine for those occasions when the market does turn around, but it can be a disaster when the loss gets worse. (Learn to overcome this big hurdle in _[Master Your Trading Mindtraps](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/07/trading_mindtraps.asp)._)  
The solution to trader risk is to work on your own habits and to be honest enough to acknowledge the times when your ego gets in the way of making the right decisions or when you simply can't manage the instinctive pull of a bad habit.  
The best way to objectify your trading is by keeping a journal of each trade, noting the reasons for entry and exit and keeping score of how effective your system is. In other words how confident are you that your system provides a reliable method in stacking the odds in your favor and thus provide you with more profitable trade opportunities than potential losses.  
  
**Conclusion**  
Risk is inherent in every trade you take, but as long as you can measure risk you can manage it. Just don't overlook the fact that risk can be magnified by using too much leverage in respect to your trading capital as well as being magnified by a lack of liquidity in the market. With a disciplined approach and good trading habits, taking on some risk is the only way to generate good rewards.

Forex Risk  
  
If you are actively trading in the forex markets then **forex risk** management needs to be high on your list of priorities to become adept at. The reasons for this are quite clear. Forex can make you enormous amounts of money very quickly (for example [this forex system consistently makes money](http://www.forexrisk.org/bestforex)), but on the flip side it is also possible to lose money very quickly, and the difference between a sustainable trading strategy and gambling really comes down to money management.  
  
_Forex risk_ management cannot simply be left to chance. In the same way that you may well look at historical forex data to plan out what to trade and when. You equally need to have strategies in place to tell you when to let the profits in a trade run, and when to cut them short. And you need to have these clearly established ahead of time, so that in the heat of the trading battle you don’t fall prey to that little voice in your head that says that this situation is somehow different from previous occasions, and so you should just “Wing It” or “Go With Your Instinct”. More often then not that thought will end up seeing you poorer then when you started out, so don’t fall prey to it.  
  
Instead use a forex system that works and keep the following forex risk strategies in mind when you trade.  
  
**Here are Five Forex Risk Management Strategies to consider:**  
  
_1/ Establish Limits On The Amount You Trade_  
This is a key aspect to regaining control in your trading. You can make winning trades 90% of the time. But still end up losing all your money if you start to think you are invincible and keep on doubling up every time. You should establish clear limits on how much of your total bankroll you are prepared to risk on any one trade. A good rule of thumb might be to not invest more than 1% in any single trade. So that whilst you are unlikely to make a killing very quickly, you are also limiting your losses. And should be able to sleep better at night [http://www.forexrisk.org/wp-includes.../icon_razz.gif](http://www.forexrisk.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif)  
  
_2/ Make Sure You Have Clearly Defined Stop Loss Points And Take Your Profits  
_Again this is primarily about limiting trading blindness. It is no good imagining that everything will turn out ok. You have to know it for sure. And for that to be the case you have to have clear established stop points for both profits and losses in your [forex risk management](http://www.forexrisk.org/forex-risk-management/) plan.  
  
_3/ Avoid Trading Similar Instruments That Tend To Track Each Other_  
For example, the GBP and the US Dollar tend to move together, as do the Euro and the US Dollar. So it is best not to be trade both of them simultaneously. All you are doing in such a situation is to ramp up risk. You will make more money on trades that go your way, but on the flip side you will make greater losses if things turn out badly, as both will fall together. In essence you will have become a gambler, which should not be your aim with trading forex. Making consistent profits should be. And for that you need not only a [great forex system](http://www.forexrisk.org/bestforex), but to be good at handling the money once you have made it.  
  
_4/ Avoid Chasing Your Losses_  
This is a key forex risk management principal. If you constantly chase a trade in the hope that it will turn your way, then you are acting a little like someone betting on a roulette wheel who keeps trying to double up on black, when the wheel keeps churning out red numbers, under the thought that eventually his luck must turn. This is not a good way to handle a financial portfolio, and you should be wary of becoming overly emotional about trading. The more emotionally dispassionate you can remain the better it will work for you.  
  
_5/ Make Your Portfolio More Diverse_  
Always try to add in additional diversity into your portfolio through stock, options , bonds etc. In this way you will be more likely to have a more stable fund of money, as some will make losses, but others will profit, and they will balance each other out over time.  
  
**Forex Risk… Final Thoughts**  
One great way that you can add more diversity into your trading and reduce your [forex risk](http://www.forexrisk.org/forex-risk-management/) is to try out proven forex trading systems. As you can then get to piggyback on other traders experiences, often for relatively small amounts of money.

Forex Scalping: A High Risk Strategy  
  
Forex scalping is a high risk strategy in which the trader enters multiple short term positions with the expectation that the small gains made in each trade will in time accumulate to justify the time and effort devoted to the task. Scalping is a popular method because of its ease, and the psychological comfort it provides to traders. We like seeing our gains realized as soon as possible, and holding a position for the longer term is stressful and difficult for the inexperienced person. With scalping these issues are avoided, as trades rarely last more than five minutes, and the multiple short term profits ensure a version of the instant gratification sought by the modern man in almost every endeavor.  
Scalping is a technical method, since fundamental tools rarely work at the timeframes involved in this type of strategy. While applying technical strategies in scalping the only problem is caused by the spread. The shorter the timeframe, the smaller the potential profit, and the larger the proportion of the spread to any potential profit. Although technical methods work equally well at every timeframe, whether it is 5 minutes, or five hours, the problems caused by the spread mean that the scalper is always at a disadvantage in comparison to the long term trader: he must create a better performance just to break even.  
The best way of profiting from a scalping strategy is employing the method during quite market conditions. Since at those times the market tends to fluctuate aimlessly around a central point, it is possible to profit from tiny aimless movements with the scalper's favored entry-exit habits. On the other hand it's hard to use this method at times of maximum volatility, such as after and during news releases, or during the peak hours of the day.  
The most suitable time for low intensity scalping is between the close of banks in New York, and the beginning of forex trading in Japan. As banks across the U.S. shut down their trading desks, trading comes to a halt, and volatility falls across the board, creating the aimless, trendless conditions favoring low intensity scalping.

** High Risk Investment **  
  
**RISK DISCLOSURE STATEMENT**  
This brief statement does not disclose all of the risks and other significant aspects of spot foreign currency and options trading on margin (collectively "Forex").  
BECAUSE OF THE VOLATILE NATURE OF THE OFF-EXCHANGE FOREIGN CURRENCY MARKETS, THE PURCHASE AND SALE OF OFF-EXCHANGE FOREIGN CURRENCY INVOLVE A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK. OFF-EXCHANGE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS ARE NOT SUITABLE FOR MANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. SUCH TRANSACTIONS SHOULD BE ENTERED INTO ONLY BY PERSONS WHO HAVE CAREFULLY CONSIDERED THE RISKS INVOLVED WITH THE TRADING OF OFF-EXCHANGE FOREIGN CURRENCIES. A PERSON SHOULD NOT PURCHASE OFF-EXCHANGE FOREIGN CURRENCIES UNLESS HE OR SHE IS PREPARED TO SUSTAIN A TOTAL LOSS OF THE PURCHASE PRICE. ALL INVESTORS SHOULD READ AND UNDERSTAND THE DISCLOSURE OF RISKS RELATING TO THE TRADING OF OFF-EXCHANGE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS WHICH IS PROVIDED TO ALL INVESTORS IN CONNECTION WITH THE OPENING OF A TRADING ACCOUNT WITH AVA FX.  
  
The high degree of leverage available can work against you as well as for you. Before deciding to invest in Forex you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite and other circumstances. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your investment and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You may be liable for losses that exceed the amount of margin that you post.  
Trading in [Forex](http://www.avafx.com/) is not suitable for many members of the public. You should carefully consider whether trading is appropriate for you in light of your experience, objectives, financial resources and other relevant circumstances. In light of the risks, you should undertake such transactions only if you (the "Customer") understand the nature of the trading into which you are about to engage and the extent of your exposure to risk.  
  
**1\. Trading Is Very Speculative and Risky.**  
Forex is highly speculative and is suitable only for those Customers who (a) understand and are willing to assume the economic, legal and other risks involved, and (b) are financially able to assume losses significantly in excess of margin or deposits. Forex is not an appropriate investment for retirement funds. Customer represents warrants and agrees that Customer understands these risks; that Customer is willing and able, financially and otherwise, to assume the risks of Forex and that loss of Customer’s entire account balance will not change Customer’s life style.  
  
**2\. High Leverage And Low Margin Can Lead To Quick Losses.**  
The high leverage and low margin associated with Forex can result in significant losses due to price changes in Foreign Exchange Contracts and Cross Currency Contracts. The amount of initial margin may be small relative to the value of the foreign currency so that transactions are "leveraged" or "geared". A relatively small market movement may have a proportionately larger impact on the funds you have deposited or will have to deposit: this may work against you as well as for you. You may sustain a total loss of initial margin funds and any additional funds deposited with the firm to maintain your position. If the market moves against your position or margin levels are increased, you may be called upon to pay substantial additional funds on short notice to maintain your position. If you fail to comply with a request for additional funds within the time prescribed, your position may be liquidated at a loss and you will be liable for any resulting deficit. Customers must maintain the minimum margin requirement on their open positions at all times. It is the customer"s responsibility to monitor his/her account balance. We have the right to liquidate any or all open positions whenever the minimum margin requirement is not maintained.  
The high degree of leverage that is obtainable in the trading of off-exchange foreign currency transactions can work against you as well as for you. Leverage can lead to large losses as well as gains.  
  
**3 Risk-reducing Orders Or Strategies.**  
The placing of certain orders (e.g., "stop-loss" orders, where permitted under local law, or "stop-limit" orders), which are intended to limit losses to certain amounts, may not be effective because market conditions may make it impossible to execute such orders. Strategies using combinations of positions, such as "spread" and "straddle" positions, may be as risky as taking simple "long" or "short" positions.  
  

Transactions in foreign currency options carry a high degree of risk. Purchasers and sellers of foreign currency options should familiarize themselves with the type of option (i.e., put or call) which they contemplate trading and the associated risks. You should calculate the extent to which the value of the options must increase for your position to become profitable, taking into account the premium and all transaction costs.  
The purchaser of options may offset or exercise the options or allow the options to expire depending on the nature and type of option purchased. The exercise of an option will always result in a cash settlement. In some instances, the purchaser may acquire a spot position with associated liabilities for margin. If the purchased options expire worthless, you will suffer a total loss of your investment, which will consist of the option premium plus transaction costs. If you are contemplating purchasing deep-out-of-the-money options, you should be aware that the chance of such options becoming profitable ordinarily is remote. Selling ("writing" or "granting") an option generally entails considerably greater risk than purchasing options. Although the premium received by the seller is fixed, the seller may sustain a loss well in excess of that amount. The seller will be liable for additional margin to maintain the position if the market moves unfavorably. The seller will also be exposed to the risk of the purchaser exercising the option and the seller will be obligated to either settle the option in cash or to acquire or deliver the underlying interest. In some instances, the seller may acquire a spot position with associated liabilities for margin. If the option is "covered" by the seller holding a corresponding position in the underlying currency or another option, the risk may be reduced. If the option is not covered, the risk of loss can be unlimited. The purchaser is still subject to the risk of losing the premium and transaction costs. When the option is exercised or expires, the purchaser is responsible for any unpaid premium outstanding at that time.  
  
**5\. Prices, Margin And Valuations Are Set By Us And May Be Different From Prices Reported Elsewhere.**  
We will provide prices to be used in trading, valuation of Customer positions and determination of margin requirements. Prices reported by us may vary from prices available to banks and other participants in what is known as the interbank market. We will exercise considerable discretion in setting and collecting margin. We are authorized to convert funds in Customer’s account for margin into and from such foreign currency at a rate of exchange determined by us in our sole discretion on the basis of then-prevailing money market rates.  
  
**6\. One Click Trading And Immediate Execution.**  
We offer also on our automated order entry system immediate transmission of Customer’s order once Customer enters the notional amount and clicks “Buy/Sell.” There is no “second look” before transmission, and Market Orders cannot be cancelled. This feature may be different from other trading systems. Customer agrees that by using our order-entry system, Customer agrees to the one-click system and accepts the risk of this immediate transmission feature.  
  
**7\. Telephone Orders And Immediate Execution.**  
Market Orders executed through our Trading Desk are completed when we say “deal” or “done.” At that point Customer has bought or sold and cannot cancel the Market Order. By placing Market Orders through our Trading Desk, Customer agrees to such immediate execution and accepts the risk of this immediate execution feature.  
  
**8\. Market Recommendations Are Informational, Customer Makes Independent Decisions, And We Are Not An Adviser Or A Fiduciary To Customer.**  
The market recommendations that we provide do not constitute an offer to buy or sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy or sell, any Foreign Exchange Contracts or Cross Currency Contracts. Each decision by Customer to enter into a Contract or other transaction with us and each decision whether a Contract or other transaction is appropriate or proper for Customer is an independent decision by Customer. We are not acting as an advisor or serving as a fiduciary to Customer. Customer agrees that we have no fiduciary duty to Customer and no liability in connection with and is not responsible for any liabilities, claims, damages, costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, incurred in connection with Customer following our trading recommendations or taking or not taking any action based upon any recommendation or information provided by us.  
  
**9\. Recommendations Are Based On Personal Judgments And Are Not Guaranteed.**  
Our market recommendations are based solely on the judgment of our personnel. These market recommendations may or may not be consistent with the market positions or intentions of Ava Financial Ltd., Avafx Inc., its affiliates and employees. Our market recommendations are based upon information believed to be reliable, but we cannot and do not guarantee the accuracy or completeness thereof or represent that following such recommendations will reduce or eliminate the risk inherent in Forex.  
  
**10\. There is no Central Market or Clearinghouse Guarantee of Payment.**  
Forex trading with us is not conducted on a regulated market or exchange. Each Contract is a contract directly between us and the Customer. There is no clearinghouse and no guarantee by any other party of our payment obligations to the Customer. Customer must look only to us for performance on all Contracts in Customer’s account and for return of any margin or collateral. Our insolvency or a default by us could cause Customer to lose the value of its account and to suffer additional losses from open positions.  
  
**11\. No Guarantees Of Profit.**  
There are no guarantees of profit or freedom from loss in Forex. Customer has received no such guarantees from us or from any of our representatives. Customer is aware of the risks inherent in Forex and is financially able to bear such risks and withstand any losses incurred.  
  
**12\. Commission, Conversions and Other Charges.**  
Before you begin to trade, you should obtain a clear explanation of all commission, fees and other charges for which you will be liable. You should be aware that profit and loss in foreign currency-denominated contracts (whether they are traded in your own or another jurisdiction) will be affected by fluctuations in currency rates where there is a need to convert from the currency denomination of the contract to another currency. These charges will affect your net profit (if any) or increase your loss.  
We are compensated through the difference between the buy amd sell price  
**  
13\. Transactions in Other Jurisdictions.**  
Transactions on markets in other jurisdictions, including markets formally linked to a domestic market, may expose you to additional risk. Such markets may be subject to regulation, which may offer different or diminished investor protection. Before you trade you should enquire about any rules relevant to your particular transactions. Your local regulatory authority will be unable to compel the enforcement of the rules of regulatory authorities or markets in other jurisdictions where your transactions have been effected.  
  
**14\. Password Protection.**  
You are obligated to keep passwords secret and ensure that third parties do not obtain access to your online account. You will be liable for trades executed by means of your password even if such use may be wrongful.  
  
**15\. Customer May Not Be Able To Close Open Positions.**  
Due to market conditions or other circumstances we may be unable to close out Customer’s position at the level specified by Customer, and Customer agrees that we will bear no liability for failure to do so.  
  
**16\. Trading Ahead And Along.**  
Our personnel and affiliates and various other parties may execute orders at the same or better prices ahead of a Customer Order.  
  
**17\. Third Party Agents.**  
In the event that Customer grants trading authority or control over Customer’s account to a third party (the “Trading Agent”), whether on a discretionary or non-discretionary basis, We shall in no way be responsible for reviewing Customer’s choice of such Trading Agent or for making any recommendations with respect thereto. We make no representations or warranties concerning any Trading Agent; we shall not be responsible for any loss to Customer occasioned by the actions of the Trading Agent; and we do not, by implication or otherwise, endorse or approve of the operating methods of the Trading Agent. If Customer gives the Trading Agent authority to exercise any of its rights over its account, Customer does so at Customer’s risk. Even though the undersigned grants authority to Trading Agent, Customer should be diligent and closely scrutinize all account activity.  
  
**18\. Internet Trading.**  
There are risks associated with utilizing an Internet-based deal execution trading system including, but not limited to, the failure of hardware, software and Internet connection. Since we do not control signal power, its reception or routing via Internet, configuration of Customer’s equipment or reliability of its connection, we shall not be liable for any claims, losses, damages, loss of profits, special or consequential damages, cost of procurement of substitute goods or services, costs or expenses, including attorneys’ fees, caused, directly or indirectly, by any breakdown or failure of any transmission or communication system or computer facility or trading software, whether belonging to us, Customer, any market, or any settlement or clearing system when Customer trades online (via Internet). In addition, we are not responsible for the breach of any Internet security with respect to your Account. We have no liability or duty of indemnification related to unusable data, lost or corrupt Customer transactions or data, by whatever means, in whatever form, resulting in part or in whole from third-party software or networking goods or services or from internet related problems or from actions or events outside of our control.  
  
**19\. Telephone Orders.**  
We are not responsible for disruption, failure or malfunction of telephone lines.  
  
**20\. Quoting Errors.**  
Should a quoting error occur due to a mistype of a quote or a misquote given by telephone and/or electronic means (including responses to Customer requests), we are not liable for any resulting errors in account balances and reserve the right to make necessary corrections or adjustments on the account involved. Any dispute arising from such quoting errors will be resolved on the basis of the fair market value, as determined by us, in our sole discretion, of the relevant currency at the time such an error occurred. In cases where the prevailing market represents prices different from the prices we have posted on our screen, we will attempt, on a best efforts basis, to execute trades on or close to the prevailing market prices. These prevailing market prices will be the prices, which are ultimately reflected on the customer statements. This may or may not adversely affect customer realized and unrealized gains and losses.  
  
**21\. Creditor Priority in Bankruptcy.**  
You should familiarize yourself with the protections accorded money or other property you deposit for domestic and foreign transactions, particularly in the event of a firm insolvency or bankruptcy. The extent to which you may recover your money or property may be governed by specific legislation or local rules. In some, but not all, jurisdictions, property, which has been specifically identifiable as your own, will be pro-rated in the same manner as cash for purposes of distribution in the event of a shortfall.  
  
**22\. Local Laws.**  
This site is not intended for use by any person in any country where such use would be contrary to local law or regulation. It is the responsibility of visitors to this Web site to ascertain the terms of and comply with any local law or regulation to which they or the trades they undertake are subject.  
  
**Secondary Risk Disclosure: High Risk Investment**  
In addition to standard industry disclosures contained in this Agreement, you should be aware that margined currency trading is one of the riskiest forms of investment available in the financial markets and is only suitable for sophisticated individuals and institutions. An account with us permits you to trade foreign currencies on a highly leveraged basis (up to approximately 100 times your account equity or as otherwise permitted by applicable regulation). An initial deposit of $1,000 may enable the trader to take a maximum position with $100,000 notional market value. The funds in an account trading at maximum leverage can be completely lost, if the position(s) held in the account has a two percent swing in value. Given the possibility of losing an entire investment, speculation in the foreign exchange market should only be conducted with risk capital funds that if lost will not significantly affect your personal or institution"s financial well being.  
If you have pursued only conservative forms of investment in the past, you may wish to study currency trading further before continuing an investment of this nature. You must realize that you could sustain a total loss of all funds you deposit with your broker as initial margin as well as substantial amounts of capital, when trading currencies or currency options, should the market go against your investment. You must also realize that the limited risk in buying options means you could lose the entire option investment should the option expire worthless. If you wish to continue with your investment, you acknowledge that the funds you have committed are purely risk capital and loss of your investment will not jeopardize your style of living nor will it detract from your future retirement program. Additionally, you fully understand the nature and risks of currency and currency options investments, and your obligations to others will not be neglected should you suffer investment losses.

****High or Low Risk Rate****  
  
For every trade that you enter you would always have to make a decision regarding the risk rate. Set it high and the rewards may be great but the losses just as much; set it low and the rewards may be low and the losses just as much.  
The **risk rate** is the multiplier used in every trade. One might think that a high risk rate is always good especially if the trading strategy used is, sort of a sure thing. But careful reconsideration should be taken whenever risk rates are to be adjusted.  
Different risk rates are useful for certain situations. Use a risk rate for the wrong situation and you might either face a quick and easy loss or a slow and painful income.  
You have to always think about the risk rate that you plan to use because once the trade is entered you won’t be able to change the settings except for the take profit and stop loss rates. But the advantage here is that once you have a set trading strategy then you won’t have to bother with the risk rate because you would just have to always set it in the same rate every time.  
The high risk rate is perfect for those looking for a quick income specifically scalpers. Scalpers usually enter trades and exit as soon as an income is earned. The high risk rate allows scalpers to enter low trade amounts and their trades would usually earn or lose immediately.  
Using a high risk rate requires careful analysis because the slightest wrong move might mean a stop loss about to take place.  
Medium risk rates are perfect for those day traders who enter and exit trades once a day. The trades are able to move freely within the day without hitting stop loss immediately.  
Low risk rate is the ideal rate for weekly or monthly traders. This allows their trades to freely move around for the weeks to come. The analysis used here should be an analysis method designed for a whole month.

****The New Risk-Factor For Forex Markets****  
Posted: August 17, 2011 8:10AM by [FOREX.com ](http://www.investopedia.com/contributors/default.aspx?id=593)  
  
By Kathleen Brooks: Research Director UK, [FOREX.com](http://www.forex.com/) The last couple of weeks have been a roller coaster ride for investors in the foreign exchange market. Some of this volatility was fueled by fears about the European debt crisis and growth prospects for the debt-ridden western world, but a new risk factor has altered market dynamics: intervention risk.   
Traditionally during periods of market turmoil FX investors have turned to the Swiss franc and the Japanese yen. It is hard-wired in traders that the Swissie and the yen are the asset classes of choice when risk is sold due to their relative political stability and high proportion of debt held domestically.   
However, not any more. After hitting record highs versus the euro and the dollar, the Swiss National Bank (the SNB) said enough-was-enough and started to directly intervene in the markets from August 3, 2011.   
  
**Swiss Franc Movement**  
The SNB took the market by surprise and lowered interest rates to zero try and dissuade people from buying its currency. The logic was that if a currency doesn't yield anything investors don't earn a return and so won't want to buy the currency. But old habits die hard. At the peak of last week's turmoil when the markets were fearful for the European banking sector and as French bond [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") with Germany reached multi-year highs, the Swiss franc was a mere 70 pips away from parity against the euro.   
After failing at its first attempt the SNB isn't taking any chances and is currently boosting its weaponry to try and weaken the franc. It is reported to be looking at a potential peg to the euro, negative interest rates and even targeting a floor in EURCHF and USDCHF that would formalize direct intervention in the currency markets once the Swissie reached a certain level.   
Rather than rush into the Swiss franc when the going gets tough, investors now need to take a step back and consider if they want to fight the SNB. After near capitulation there has been a massive rebound in EURCHF, which has surged by more than 10 big figures as the franc sagged. The SNB is serious and will do all it takes to dampen buying pressure on its currency.   
  
**Japan Follows Switzerland**  
The Japanese followed suit quickly after the SNB announced its action. Investors crowd into the yen during periods of turmoil in the markets, particularly into dollar-yen, which has also reached record lows. But the Bank of Japan, having intervened in the past and had its fingers burnt, did not use the heavy tactics of the SNB and the yen has managed to keep hold of most its value. The Japanese authorities may have to take more action as exporters are already complaining about yen strength and some analysts think it will hit third quarter growth figures.   
  
**What It Means for the Markets**  
This has major market implications as central banks can intervene in the markets or lower interest rates to reduce upward pressure on their currencies without any notice as the SNB and BOJ have reminded us. While the outcome of central bank action can be different: it can have a major market impact like the SNB or end up more of a damp squib like the BOJ, it has one common feature – often central banks don't give warning.   
Investors now have to try and price in the prospect of central bank risk. As we mentioned above, not only is the timing of the action unpredictable, but so is its effect. However, since a central bank can print money and it has direct control of the levers that affect a currency's value, investors need to take this risk seriously.   
The SNB in particular, and the BOJ to a lesser extent, seem willing to use all of their power to break the association of their currencies with the safe haven label. This will have major market implications as there are no obvious successors to this much-maligned crown.   
The sovereign debt crisis rules out Europe, the pound has its own fiscal fires to fight and the Pacific currencies- the Aussie and the Kiwi – are still too dependent on global growth to take the mantle. Emerging market currencies are also off the list they are either tightly controlled (like China and Singapore) or have also tried to reduce pressure on their currencies by implementing capital controls (like Brazil).   
If central banks get their way then the traditional relationships in FX markets will no longer exist. An absence of safe havens in currency markets is likely to boost the attractiveness of Treasuries and gold in times of market panic. But FX will never become a purely "risky" asset class like stocks because of the way in which it is traded.   
  
**The Bottom Line**  
In FX, inevitably there is something going up. While the traditional safe havens may no longer be as safe due to central bank intervention risk, the markets will instead concentrate on relative value. This means more work for traders as they get to work trying to sift out the weak currencies from the strong.

This thread is since 2011 November 10 open (1 month).  
  
Maybe some of you could have get a feeling of some aspects:  
  
E.g.  
\- Could the CCI-Indicator be a help for me? Yes or No?   
\- What is the idea of the CCI-Analysis, ...and at different Time Frames (MTFA)  
\- What could be the strength and the weakness of the CCI Analysis for me?  
\- Do there exist any market situations (environments) or times which are the best one for me?  
\- What other indicators coud I combine with it?...and might it really necessary?  
  
What become improved is your understanding and trading practice. To do so requires some efforts of trial and tracking your progress.

See #[**749**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5212585#post5212585)  
  
Hi newnew!  
  
Look for further details, please.  
<http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=326305>  
  
\---  
e.g.  
[http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...=326305&page=3](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=326305&page=3), #[**34**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5150860#post5150860)   
  
**123PatternsV6 prints arrows using the following calculation.** SellArrow[shift] = High[shift]+(High[shift]-Low[shift])/3;  
  
In other words look at the breaking candle. Calculate the range (size) of that candle (range=high-low). Divide that range by 3. Add that value to the high and print the arrow at that price.  
  
In effect the arrows are printed _above_ the breaking candle at a variable distance from the candle (1/3 of the candle height).  
  
If the candle size is large then arrow will be further above. If the candle size is small the arrow will be lower. In other words if there is a lot of momentum we expect a stronger pullback. Assuming that the bulls don't give up the fight.  
  
  
Note:  
"Arrows tend to make people think, "OK time to trade" which is not right". See [http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...=326305&page=4](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=326305&page=4), #[**47**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5155334#post5155334).  
  
\---  
  
I don't use robdee's trading technic here at this board. This indicator makes good horizontal lines. That is what I like! The arrows aren't much important for me. I use the CCI-Top & Bottom signals.  
  
Kindest regards

i am doing great in CCI divergence with MTFA.  
It works best in all market accept high volatility.   
I found no other indicator useful combined with cci.   
I am still weak in TOP and BOTTOM trading that works best for FXcube and others. i donno why! may be i donno the exact point of entry.  
  
yes i need to practice more.   
Now a days i ain't sharing my trade images cause i am so busy with my exams.  
  
  
thanks FXcube to introduce me with such a great thing.

1 Month? Wow.. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
\- I'm not doing really well with TASAYC method for the moment, cash wise  
\- Can't really figure out how to make "big cash" like FXC without risking my neckbone ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
\- Works best in volatile, rangebound markets  
\- No others indicator requied BUT Carl's one!  
  
But those are just opinions, and maybe i need more pratice!!

There is nothing going on. Lets continue to learn.  
  
Forexcube, I think there is a way to remove that post.  
I'll contact a moderator. You should too.  
That post is a distraction.

So, I think its time to take a 1/10 on EURUSD. Major call option level here at 3233. Next level of support is heavy put option resistance at 3186 (1800 put options O/I).

Yep, but when price is trending oscillators like cci or stochs are quite useless. They are all the time proposing counter trend trades - not good. You need other strategies to make pips during trends.   
  
Here is my 4h euro chart as an example of other methods. I have used Elliot waves there. Expecting a bounce / turn near 1.312  
  
Sorry about the interruption Cube, you seem to have a nice little debate going on...

I think Forexcube is gone for good.  
  
All it takes is one person, to screw all us small guys out of the fantastic education that Forexcube was giving us.  
  
Forexcube was obviously a very successful trader. He pulled 60% return from an account in one week.  
He did not have to spend his days in this thread, but he did.   
He was helping us see trading/scalping in a way that I had never seen.  
  
I am sad he is gone, but glad he had the heart to share what he did.

No disrespect Rocroy, but I have been into Elliot waves before. I know there are rules, but I still find Elliot wave to be too subjective.  
  
If you have a different way to evaluate Elliot waves (more precise) I think many would love to hear it.

How do we manage the initial stop loss when we place the trade ? So far I read the 12 step.  
I took the same trade as you did #[**795**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5222544#post5222544) , but put a stop at 1.29700 and got stopped out . Can you advise what you did on this trade as far as stop loss goes ?  
  
Excellent thread , I didnt realise how significant the CCI can be .

Hi Sandovich  
  
Basically like this:  

Inserted Video

  
  
....with some mutations:  
(1) I trade often (1/10) - (5/10) of my maximum possible order size (when I normally would trade 1 Lot per trade this Lot might be hackled into 10 x 0.1) so I could set the stop loss further afar.  
(2) E.G I will make an EURUSD entry order Long at M15 and H4, so I have to look at M15 and at H4 for different Stop Loss Levels.  
(2) If 95-98% of all 2% rule Stop Loss orders will run in a win sooner or later why to set a stop loss so tight. I trade predominantly only 1/10 or 2/10 of the normal entry deposits and 95-98% of all the colorable loss orders will run in a win.  
(3) I hedge positions if it's necessary.   
(4) If I wouldn't trust my own multiple time frame market analysis maybe I have to follow this sh*t 2% rule! (extreme example: see #[**714**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5210300#post5210300), "Profit Trades" 254, "Loss Trades" 0)  
  
Another Stop Loss concept:

I try to take the risk over and trade the H4 divergence at a CCI-daily's Top.

See also Weekly & Monthly chart (#[**801**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5224651#post5224651)), please.  
  
Note:   
If the market price will definitely cross the monthly resistance line further upside movements seems possible.   
If so then a helpful signal could be if the weekly candle will close above the monthly resistance line.

Weekly seems at the top. Be aware if the market price will run down the monthly resistance line.  
If so then further upside movements seems possible.

Hi Carl  
  
I use this brilliant indi for my alerts on 5,15 and 30min.  
  
Will it be possible to take the writting of the screen and only keep alert arrows ?  
  
When I have 4 charts open the writting is to much on screen and I only need the arrows to give me heads up.  
  
Thanks mate.

Hi astock  
Please bear with me. I will explain "LOM" step by step. I also can't finished it yet, presently. It needs more time to explain basics at first and then the advanced concept. Moreover I have to wait of orders at first which are running in a loss zone and then I can display how might be to manage in practice.

LOM  
Loss Order Management  
  
Ratio 1:10  
  
Initial Situation  
Open Minus Orders is an absolutely normal status quo, if you trade at the forex market.  
The question is: How much could an account absorb a depth?  
Here you see an example of a 250K Account with a target about 1% a Day, say 2'500.-$ per Day when you trade.   
If you trade 4 days a week then it's your job to make a profit about 1'000.-$ per week.  
  
Next Step:  
The Loss Order Management Concept is based on a ratio which depends how much you earn per day at an average.  
If I make 1% per day and beyond that +5% (Total 6%), so I can have much more money of all open orders into the minus.  
15'000.-$ minus 2'500.-$ = 12'500.-$ . When I trade conservative, most of the time when I start a new account, then it could be a landmark for me. But that's not the end off the story.   
  
  
Higher Risk Account  
I love also to trade with higher risk at another account. Here I make a cash method of accounting.  
E.g. We are talking about a 100K Account.  
Say if I earn per day 5'000.-$ I could manage open orders in the minus about 50'000.-$.   
Oh yes you are reading correct! Ten times as much!  
Why!  
Because after 10 days you have earn 50'000.-$ so it should be easy to manage your Loss Orders around 50'000.$  
At this account my target could be also 1% per day, the same value as the conservative well-conducted account, with the variation that here I should trade with higher risk.

LOM  
Loss Order Management  
  
Ratio 1:10  
  
Open Trades  
2011 December 15, 23:32 GMT+1  
  
Closed Trades  
2011 December 2015  
see attachment (*.pdf).  
  
Example 1  
Today I have make 55'038.33$ with an 250K Account. If my target is 1% per day so I could mange open orders in the minus till maximum 55'000.-$ - 2'500.-$ say 52'500.-$. (we don't count the 38.33$ just now).  
Thats my calculation of Loss Order Mangement.  
Why can I do this in this way? Because I have earn too much than I expected.  
Now, I don't possibly make so much money every day! So we come to the next example.  
  
  
Example 2  
If I make 10'000.-$ per day on average with an 250K Account, after 10 days I have make a profit about 100'000.-$ minus the 1% per day (-10'000.-$) so it's allowed to manage a loss order portfolio about - 90'000.-$ maximum after 10 trading days.  
I think 95%-98% of these open minus trades will running back in the win zone sooner or later. If not I don't have make an excellent market analysis before.  
  
Forget the bullsh*t like:  
_"If you want to be a trader who simply makes 1 times risk on each trade, you have to win 66% of time with a risk reward of 1:1, 50% of the time with a 1:2 risk reward, and with a 1:3 risk reward your winning percentage can be as low as 33% to make a 1R profit"._  
Why? You don't have at every trade the same standard market conditions (different momentum & varied volatility)! There are also market opportunities where you go in the market with more lots, and there are other market environments where you go short in and short out only for several pips (see the attachment), and so on.  
  
You have to analyse how much profit you make per day on the average and a part of this you put away for your Loss Order Management (LOM).  
  
Kindest regards

Compensation with other trades.  
  
The open orders in the minus (e.g. EURUSD 5 Lots -1'485.-$) you could counterbalance with other trades at the forex market, e.g. scalping trades, see #[**810**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5227686#post5227686), #[**811**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5227709#post5227709), #[**815**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5227813#post5227813), after your daily profit target (e.g. 1%) is reached.

forexcube,  
  
please let me understand, why you put the exit there and not at 1.3045, because there is a support line.

See #[**818**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5228721#post5228721)  
  
The first CCI-Bottom under 100, if you trade more "buck-wild".  
Conservative traders could wait till the next CCI Bottom, but you didn't know in advance.  
I trade with 1/10 orders and so I can go easier in the market at different price levels (at different CCI soil formations).

Others Shorts were still in the market. With a part of it I've decide to go out of the market as as soon as possible. That's my trading style. You could go in the market with some trades and let it more run in the win. Why not? Try it! I was in the market with a of of trades if you compare the *.pdf file in the attachment #[**813**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5227757#post5227757). I don't have draw every closed trade into the chart.

A lot of this negative Saldo were counterbalanced with shorter trades.  
  
The Maximum of Deficit which I could afford it is ten times as much as the win. My ratio is 1:10 with my trading style. You have to work out your ratio which fits the best for you, maybe it's 1:3, maybe 1:7. I don't know!

Hi Landsat  
  
18'853.-$ - 2'500.-$ = 16'353.-$   
In Switzerland here you could use the notation ./. instead of a minus (-).  
The principle seems clear I think.  
Maybe you could added the 55K from yesterday (see #[**813**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5227757#post5227757)), so we have 55K + 18K ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) (approximate) ./. 5K = 68K for LOM. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

LOM  
  
The performance value of 1% target is nothing where we have to talk more about it. Other traders could have a net profit target around 0.25% per day or 0.1% per day. It's also okay!  
  
The Loss Order Management (LOM) is the root cause key for a really successfull trading. The 1% target seems okay. You could make money with it quite alone, ...moreover with LOM you make important more profit!  
  
It's a complex order management stratgegy how to fulfill an order to minimize the loss orders.

Loss Order Management   
Equity  
  
See #[**813**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5227757#post5227757), #[**828**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5230073#post5230073)  
  
55'038,33$ + 44'030.79$ = 99'069.12$ ./. 2 x 2'500.-$ = 94'069.12$   
  
Note:  
The Loss Order Management seems to have now with a counter balance of 94'069.12$ the "absolutely freedom".  
If I make my "Multiple-Time-Frame-Analysis" in a right way there should have no doubt that you don't have to go out of the market with the minus orders too early ,...,you could wait if some of these could run back into the win zone and make your LOM during this session. There should be no need to go out with your minus trade too early.  
  
Equity  
You could also take the Equity: 347'278.15$ (see #[**829**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5230090#post5230090)) ./. 250'000.-$ = 147'278.15 ./. 2 x 2'500.-$ = 142'278.15$ to manage all open minus orders (LOM). When you trade all the days it could be heavy handed to summarize all daily profits in the past. Use the Equity minus the profit target. E.g. If you have traded 20 days: Equity ./. 250'000.- (Deposit) ./. 20 x 2.500.-$ (in this case: Target 1% per day) = x (for LOM)

forexcube  
  
thank's for your answer about LOM , i was not questioning your profit , but really the risk engaged calculation process.  
and as your calculation look simple i just tried to make it complicate..loool  
  
  
with all the live example that you show us ,the strategy , the entry and exit process are very clear.   
nevertheless i believe that LOM has a real impact on the overall performance.

Scalping Example  
EURUSD, M1, 2011 December 16  
  
CCI and the Limit  
  
Excursion  
You couldn't strictly trade the CCI-Tops-&-Bottoms all along.  
See this example where the CCI-Bottom was traded with some Longs but the the exits were made before the CCI could have reached its Top. Why? The market situation was Friday 18:46 GMT +1 and the price market has crossed the 1.30 Line (1.3009 DPV). We don't know if there will form a resistance line, which was a support line before. So I have decide to go short time in the market with some Longs and haven't wait if the CCI will come up from the bottom to the Top. The Price Action seems to be a powerful argument in this case and in this moment.

Loss Order Management   
Example  
Ratio 1:10 / Open Trades: Closed Profit Trades  
  
2011 December 16  
Trades Today:  
Closed Trades: 152  
Loss Trades: 0  
\---  
Open Trades: 1 (GBPAUD since 2011 December 15)  
  
Approximation:   
Ratio 1:10 (Open Trades:Closed Profit Trades)  
In this example I will present the next idea of the LOM concept.  
If I have made 152 closed profits trades today I also could have had "open trades" in the minus about 15 trades which I could manage.  
The ratio is again 1:10 (open trades/closed trades).   
In this example here there is one open trade from the 2011 December 15.  
  
Every trader has to work out his own ratio which fits best for him.  
  
1:10 (Open Trades versus Closed Profit Trades) gives me an efficient information and a fast orientation about my actual risk tolerance. When I have much more open trades in the market this ratio might be like an alert for me as a hint maybe to minimize the actual risk.

Standard Pivot Points   
Pivot points are very useful tools that use the previous bars' highs, lows and closings to project support and resistance levels for future bars. The following pivot point tables are based on standard pivot point formula. Five time frames are provided: hourly, 4 hours, daily, weekly, monthly. For other types of pivot points, please check out the pages below:

1- What you meant by "Hedging Orders below the daily range" is this how you get out of all loosing trades coupled with Daily weekly trend?  
  
2- do you buy sell same pairs in same direction or uses -ve correlated pairs in Hedgeing?  
  
3- what daily range your using? yesterdays or average daily range of last 5 days?

Hello fxpreach  
  
I've written  
  
"...and wait for an breakout at the daily range (1.20 - 1.2280).  
Hedging Orders 45 Pips below the daily range as a function of all GBPJPY open Long orders" (#[**840**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5232791#post5232791)).  
  
1.20 - 45 Pips = 1.1955. I set GBPJPY Short @ 1.1955.  
Kindest regards  
FXcube

Scalping   
could be fast and efficient, action might be as quickly as possible in some market situations.  
  
Quick-acting...swift-flowing.

Example 7  
  
My intention was to minimize the quantity of open trades (see also #[**837**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5230876#post5230876)). EURUSD Long were in the market and my job was to analyze the actual EURUSD M1/M5/M30 charts if I could let the Longs further run in the market without any Hedging activities by closing some Long Profit Orders parallel. So what I have to do is to go out of the market at M5 CCI-Top (see #[**857**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5235006#post5235006)) with some trades in the profit and let other further run in the market in the anticipation that the pivotal point (DPV 1.3007, see #[**857**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5235006#post5235006)) could be broken down and the market price should move further upside. M30 (see #[**857**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5235006#post5235006)) has signalized a good argument for it.

LOM - Life  
Loss Order Management  
Example 10  
  
LOM has a vast impact for the profit value.   
LOM activities are profit motivated!  
LOM is for-profit, is high-profit, not non-profit.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
250K, Beginning Date 2011 December 15  
Interim Result  
2011 December 20  
  
Equity: +391'227.73$  
  
Profit: +141'227.73$ ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
(+56% within 1 week)  
  
With LOM (Loss Order Management) I have actual 0% Loss Trades within one week (and 575 Trades were made).  
2-8% (Losing Trades) could be a normal value for an advanced level trader.   
Every trader has to work out his own value when he's managing the Loss Orders which depends on the risk tolerance.  
It needs an effort to manage the losing trades and LOM should be the preferred professional activity in Forex Trading.   
  
Kindest regards  
FXcube

Forexcube  
  
i will call it a Xmas gift....you really enlightened us about Loss Management, the new road that you are showing us ,is the road to freedom . this road is against everything we have read about money management.  
I believe that the majority of the readers of the thread will keep the signal part, and just throw the LOM part saying " this is too risky" let me tell you ... you really need to read again and think about it ..... and as forexcube mention often ,everyone should adapt the risk engaged to his own risk tolerance ....  
  
Cheers

1 HR, 15 Min, 5-Min CCI-Bearish Divergence.  
  
EUR Strength was divergent (weak as price went higher).  
  
And there was a put option level at 3128.  
  
I started easing into the shorts kind of early (1/10), but as the situation developed, and the divergence setup was textbook (Forexcube), I went in at (4/10) with two different positions near 3128.  
  
My final exit was with the 15 min CCI around -200 area, and an option level resides there (3063), for 130 combined pips.

Thanks, but this was already explained earlier. Its just a standard deviation tool.  
Quasi-Moving Average-Standard Deviation thingy.

Crodzilla,  
  
I have asked you because I have tried the bearish divergence earlier.  
But it was not good.  
Why according you?

Search for currency strength on this board or CCp/CCFP on the mq4 codebase.  
  
The put/call option information is available for free I believe. Mine is commercial.  
  
I'm not sure if I can post links here or not.

These divergences on the 5-min are for scalping. I can see that there should be profitable scalps in your highlighted area.  
  
Can you be more specific?  
  
Forexcube has many examples here. I am not the expert. I am learning just as you.

What do you sugest one does when they go into the red with the Loss Order Management eg. if the loss order management is set at 2% and the loss goes into 3% or more . Do you close all your trades at once , hedge or manage the loss somehow ?

Hi balouf  
Learn to understand the "Multiple Time Frame View" (Analysis).  
Look at the strong H1 Long argument. Why to take the risk over with a M5 Short directly after an abrupt upward movement where the market often consolidate at first most of the time (market situation)? If so then maybe with M1 only for some pips here and there with a SL under the last M5 candle or so.  
  
I would wait in this unstable market situation, maybe take some M1 Long and Shorts for some pips with a tight stop loss.  
  
Don't pick out only one chart if you trade, please.  
  
Kindest regards  
FXcube

Hi Sandovich  
  
First  
Don't go in a trade where you have reached the 2%-Level at speed. Go in with minimize lot sizes, maybe with a calculation of 0.2% for some trades.   
  
Second  
I would try to hedge all these orders and would liquidate then only the Longs (or the Shorts) at a higher time frame and would wait if the other Shorts (or Longs) would come back. That the reason why I make a Multiple Time Frame Analysis before I go in a trade. I look if my trades could have the room for LOM.

Implicit  
It's clear to everybody that if you are at the weekly and monthly CCI-Top or Bottom then you don't have much room for a Loss Order Management (LOM). That's evident. Maybe too that you don't need it at these turning points. At monthly's valleys and hills I go in the market with 1/10 additively by setting Trailing Stops. Often starts the cash time at these points, .. time for making a long term profit with several orders. Maybe 2-4 times a year a currency pair could reach this level.

i will train myself with that method. Hope to be able to give feedback of my lessons-learned too.

Dear Forexcube   
  
Hope this is not a permanent goodbye from this thread. I and many others still learn from your trade examples, we get to see how an advanced succesful trader thinks and trades. Is there not maybe another thread that shows some more examples of your trades and your reasoning behind them?  
  
I for one have learnt some valuable knowledge from you and wish you much blessings.  
  
Regards  
Paul

Testing my new indicator...  
  
Nothing like testing theories with real money!  
  
I set-up a timeframe grid.  
I removed TMA as a filter. It has been replaced by the CCp (Strength) indicators now. Each currency will display if there is a divergence within each currencies strength within the pair.  
  
I have noticed that when both currencies in a pair are diverging with price, a correction in price is imminent.  
  
In the example screenshot of AUDUSD, the 1-Hr timeframe shows bearish divergence with both AUD and USD. The higher the number (1-10) next to the divergence text, the longer the divergence has lasted (bars).  
  
So, I switched to the 15-min, where there looks to be a topping formation. So, I'm short.  
  
I'll need to test this some more, but I'll post it early next year.  
  
Carl  
  
  
  
PS. I'm trying out the Extreme Hook indication that I noticed ForexCube uses. I don't know whether the knows it or not, but its really cool. Usually, when a pair is trending up/down strongly, there becomes a point when CCI will actually move the opposite direction! And a lot of the time, that becomes a very strong resistance area. So strong, ForexCube usually will pick that as the top/bottom (you know he is very accurate). And it will occur at extremes of CCI +-200. Go ahead, look at your charts with CCI(14). Its seems to work. And look back at his examples he's posted. Forexcube has been uncanny with the way he picks tops and bottoms.

Here is an example of the power of the CCp (Strength) indicator, freely available (but built in to my next version of the divergence indicator).  
  
On this chart of the AUDUSD-4HR, early November, price made a lower low. But both AUD made a stronger low, and USD made a deep retreat. AUDUSD was sure to bounce higher, and it did.  
  
And looking a litter earlier, end of October, you can see that AUD was severely weakening. Price tried to make a double top, but couldn't quite reach. The bear market to follow was fast and strong.  
  
These types of scenarios is what I want to be able to identify. I believe that by using ForexCube's CCI for timing, and the strength indications of the individual currencies, the probabilities for trading success are swayed immensely to our favor.  
  
Carl

Another magical moment...  
  
AUDUSD made lower lows, and then a double bottom.  
AUD was quietly strengthening and USD was treading water.  
  
BAM! Like a rubber band, AUDUSD had to move higher. Its price action foretold by the underlying strength/weakness of the individual currencies themselves.  
  
  
The second divergence was a week long double top. But the individual currency strengths told the story of the failure of that double top, with a strong freefall for the following week.  
  
We now need to mix in CCI divergences for this magic potion of profits to come to fruition.

They say never to trade the day before Christmas... bah humbug!  
  
My EURUSD grid was screaming Bullish Divergences all the way through the 1-Week chart. So, I answered the call of my grid. The CCI divergences were everywhere.  
  
I eased in (longs) with (1/10) @ 3056, just below an options level at 3061. Then another (1/10) @ 3049, mid point between options levels. Then when the options level of 3039 was hit, I went in with (3/10), for a total of (5/10) in the game.  
  
I was pretty confident that this level would hold. On the 5-min chart, the EUR was strengthening pretty boldly, and the strength divergences were plainly evident.  
  
Low and behold, EURUSD popped up nicely. Taking out my pre-determined take-profit at the 38.2% Fibonacci (+27 pips) of this move, because this might be just a bullish re-trace. And, it really is a slow day. The group of long trades took exactly 4-hours to complete.

Hi Crodzilla,  
  
I have the indicator CC but the shape of the curves are different from yours.  
Can you send me your indicator with yours parameters?  
Thank you very much!

Here you go...  
  
CC-New attached.  
  
If I remember right, this indicator has the optimized moving average parameters pre-set for each timeframe. I might have slightly modified it to take the pair suffixes into account.  
  
Change the first parameter to "true" to only show the pair attached to.  
Keeping it as "false" will show all individual currency strengths.

You can also make money when the market is really quite and are making solely small price movements.  
In this case might be it's more a question of risk tolerance.

Hi flashmaster  
I' m not a C++/MT4 programmer. Maybe it's better to ask someone else.  
It may well be you have something to code with the Date and Time Functions. "TimeCurrent()" returns the current server time, while "TimeLocal()" returns your local computer time.  
Kindest regards  
FXcube

Note:  
I manage my risk tolerance as a function of the market situation.  
I tend to go in the market with more Lot Sizes in a quiet market with a smooth price action and go out as early as possible with most of the entry orders after some pips to the good.

More testing on this slow day, but still using REAL money account...  
  
My indicator found an "Extreme Hook" on the AUDUSD on the 1-min chart. That was cool, but then a few minutes later on the 5-min, then later on the 15-min. That's when I took a closer look and found a nice divergence occurring. And then the 30-min hook alarm went off.  
  
Attached are two charts. One of the AUDUSD 5-min right after I placed my second (1/10), as things were "textbook." The second, is just before my trades reached TP.  
  
This "Extreme Hook" idea just gave me an idea on an indicator just for the "Extreme Hook." So, I can place the EH indicator on 1 chart, but give me a status of several, or a dozen symbols and all timeframes, from one chart. Then, just switch to the appropriate currency pair for further analysis. This Extreme Hook seems to be a pre-cursor to what we want to see as CCI divergence traders.  
  
This set of AUDUSD trades totaled 13-pips for about 45-min of trade time.  
  
...continuing to test.

Of course I will. I'm still finalizing the divergence indicator with CCp, and I'm working on the "Extreme Hook" indicator.

Actual Trading Levels.  
  
At the moment it seems to be the "B-Level"  
  
Note:  
Traders will be often strongly recommended not to trade outside the market hours. I don't think so!  
There are aspects I make 70% of all the daily profit outside the trading hours.

incredible - i'm with you - i understand how to make these quick wins. But, your open trades still will resist in your account, and their Lotsizes are big enough to generate big losses or wipe out the account - what are you doing when the market is awaking and volatility increases? When will you start hedging a position? You won't sit 24 hours a day to watch your trades - am i right? I would enter hedgetrades at the moment i leave the Tradingdesk and i would check the charts again when coming back for the next trading session. What is your preferred way to pause trading?  
  
I've read your posts to LOM - so i think i understand how to act when sitting in front of the MT4-Desk. With enough experience the market will tell me when to close a trade or just to hedge it. It is like a Babouschka-Strategy - start with the 1-min-Chart and go to the next higher level when S&R-Levels where broken - recover the Trades on higher levels or wait for rebound. I hope i'm correct - otherwise i should read all posts again or ask politely for the next lesson on LOM.  
  
So, if i'm right i just ask politely for the exam - how to deal when not sitting in front of my MT-4-Desk an watch my positions.  
  
thx in advance - Rob

Hi DjangoFX  
I give here some example of my trading style, not how other traders should trade. You have to modulate these marvellous concept ideas at your risk tolerance. I have said it so often here at this board. If you don't sit in front of the monitor maybe you have to minimize the risk!, ...e.g. placing hedging levels and/or minimize the lot sizes or don't trade in these moments! These answers you could really give yourself, aren't it! So I don't understand your criticism.   
Kindest regards  
FXcube

You have to make a Multiple Time Frame Analysis before setting the entry orders at the lower time frame(s). After this you've done you could use LOM.  
Right! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

.. don't read between the lines and search for criticism - there was no critic meant - i only tried to resume for myself. So let's put aside that emotional frame and use another one (should work, you are a psychologist). I#ve really appreciated that thread so far. I by myself trade several systems with hedging components too - but i am using my own progged EAs.   
  
Thx for your answer, you gave me the confirmation that i'm on the right way. I think i've understood what you meant. Everybody is trading on his own risk and i will handle that risk appropriately by my own 'feelings'.  
  
thx Rob

Hi Rob  
I like partners here at board who gives examples how they would trade in his way the CCI and LOM context possibly even in conjunction with other preferred indicators. Maybe you could give some examples of your trading and the community here could participate upon your productive ideas.   
Best regards from Switzerland

Top 4 Things Successful Forex Traders Do  
Posted: Aug 5, 2009   
  
[Trading](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trade.asp) in the financial markets is surrounded by a certain amount of mystique because there is no single formula for trading successfully. Think of the markets as being like the ocean and the trader as a surfer. Surfing requires talent, balance, patience, proper equipment and astute discrimination. Would you go into the water if there were sharks swimming all around you or dangerous rip tides? Hopefully not. (Benjamin Graham pioneered cutting edge concepts that propelled other top investors to fame. Read _[The 3 Most Timeless Investment Principles](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/07/grahamprinciples.asp)_.)  
  
The attitude to trading in the markets is no different to that required for surfing. By blending good analysis with effective implementation, your success rate will improve dramatically and, like many skill sets, good trading comes from a combination of talent and hard work. Here are the four legs of the stool that you can build into a strategy to serve you well in all markets.  
  
**Leg No.1 - Approach**   
Before you start to trade, recognize the value of proper preparation. The first step is to align your personal goals and temperament with the instruments and markets that you can comfortably relate to. For example, if you know something about retailing, then look to trade retail stocks rather than oil [futures](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futures.asp), about which you may know nothing. Begin by assessing the following three components.   

  1. **Time Frame**  
The time frame indicates the type of trading that is appropriate for your temperament. Trading off of a five-minute chart suggests that you are more comfortable being in a [position](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/position.asp) without the exposure to overnight risk. On the other hand, choosing weekly charts indicates a comfort with overnight risk and a willingness to see some days go contrary to your position.   
  
In addition, decide if you have the willingness and time to sit in front of a screen all day or if you would prefer to do your research quietly over the weekend and then make a trading decision for the coming week based on your analysis. Remember that the opportunity to make substantial money in the markets requires time. Short-term [scalping](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/scalping.asp), by definition, means small profits or losses. In this case you will have to trade more frequently. (Find out about the various styles of this trading inour [_Forex Walkthrough_](http://www.investopedia.com/walkthrough/forex/beginner/level1/currency-trading.aspx) from beginner to advanced.)
  2. **Methodology**  
Once you choose a time frame, find a consistent methodology. For example, some traders like to buy [support](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/support.asp) and sell [resistance](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/resistance.asp). Others prefer buying or selling breakouts. Yet others like to trade using indicators such as [MACD](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/macd.asp), [crossovers](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/crossover.asp) etc. (Learn more in our _[Technical Analysis Tutorial](http://www.investopedia.com/university/technical/default.asp)_.)  
  
  
Once you choose a system or methodology, test it to see if it works on a consistent basis and provides you with an edge. If your system is reliable more than 50% of the time, you will have an edge, even if it's a small one. If you [backtest](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/backtesting.asp) your system and discover that had you traded every time you were given a signal and your profits were more than your losses, chances are very good that you have a winning strategy. Test a few strategies and when you find one that delivers a consistently positive outcome, stay with it and test it with a variety of instruments and various time frames. (For more, check out our _[Trading Systems Tutorial](http://www.investopedia.com/university/tradingsystems/default.asp)_.)
  3. **Market (Instrument)**  
You will find that certain instruments trade much more orderly than others. Erratic trading instruments make it difficult to produce a winning system. Therefore, it is necessary to test your system on multiple instruments to determine that your system's "personality" matches with the instrument being traded. For example, if you were trading the [USD/JPY](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/forex/u/usd-jpy-us-dollar-japanese-yen-currency-pair.asp) currency pair in the [forex](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forex.asp) market, you may find that [Fibonacci ](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fibonaccichannel.asp)support and resistance levels are more reliable in this instrument than in some others. You should also test multiple time frames to find those that match your trading system best. (Uncover the history and logic behind this popular trading tool in _[Taking The Magic Out Of Fibonacci Numbers](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/06/fibonacci.asp)_ , and _[Advanced Fibonacci Applications](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/05/AdvFibonacci.asp)_.)

  
**Leg No.2 - Attitude  
**Attitude in trading means ensuring that you develop your mindset to reflect the following four attributes:   

  1. **Patience  
**Once you know what to expect from your system, then have the patience to wait for the price to reach the levels that your system indicates for either the point of entry or exit. If your system indicates an entry at a certain level but the market never reaches it, then move on to the next opportunity. There will always be another trade. In other words, don't chase the bus after it has left the terminal; wait for the next bus. (Learn more in _[Patience Is A Trader's Virtue](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/07/patient_investor.asp)_.)
  2. **Discipline  
**Discipline is the ability to be patient – to sit on your hands until your system triggers an action point. Sometimes the [price action](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-action.asp) won't reach your anticipated price point. At this time you must have the discipline to believe in your system and not to second-guess it. Discipline is also the ability to pull the trigger when your system indicates to do so. This is especially true for [stop losses](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stop-lossorder.asp).
  3. **Objectivity  
**Objectivity or "emotional detachment" also depends on the reliability of your system or methodology. If you have a system that provides entry and exit levels that you know have a high reliability factor, then you don’t need to become emotional or allow yourself to be influenced by the opinion of pundits who are watching their levels and not yours. Your system should be reliable enough so that you can be confident in acting on its signals. (Find out how your mindset can play a larger role in your success than market influences _[Trading Psychology And Discipline](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/02/110502.asp)_.)
  4. **Realistic Expectations  
**Even though the market can sometimes make a much bigger move than you anticipate, being realistic means that you cannot expect to invest $250 in your trading account and expect to make $1,000 each trade. Short-term time frames provide less profit opportunities than longer term, but the risk with longer-term time frames is higher. It's a question of [risk versus reward](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskreturntradeoff.asp).

  
**Leg No.3 - Discrimination**  
Different instruments trade differently depending on who the major players are and why they are trading that particular instrument. [Hedge funds](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedgefund.asp) are motivated differently than [mutual funds](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp). Large banks that are trading the spot currency market in specific currencies usually have a different objective than currency traders buying or selling [futures contracts](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futurescontract.asp). If you can determine what motivates the large players then you can often piggy-back them and profit accordingly. (For more on this type of strategy, see _[_Stop Hunting With The Big Players_](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/06/StopHunting.asp)_.)  

  1. **Alignment  
**Pick a few currencies, stocks or [commodities](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commodity.asp) and chart them all in a variety of time frames. Then apply your particular methodology to all of them and see which time frame and which instrument is most responsive to your system. This is how you discover a "personality" match for your system. Repeat this exercise regularly to adapt to changing market conditions.

  
**Leg No.4 - Management (Implementation)  
**Since there is no such thing as only profitable trades, no system will trigger a 100% sure thing. Even a profitable system, say with a 65% [profit to loss ratio](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profit_loss_ratio.asp), still has 35% losing trades. Therefore, the art of profitability is in the management and execution of the trade. (Learn more in _[The Myth Of Profit/Loss Ratios](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/07/profit_loss.asp)_.)  

  1. **Risk Control  
**In the end, successful trading is all about risk control. Take losses quickly and often if necessary. Try to get your trade in the correct direction right out of the gate. If it backs off, cut out and try again. Often it is on the second or third attempt that your trade will move immediately in the right direction. This practice requires patience and discipline but when you get the direction right you can [trail your stops](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trailingstop.asp) and almost always be profitable at best, or break even at worst.

  
**The Bottom Line  
**There are as many nuanced methods of trading as there are traders. There is no right or wrong way to trade. There is only a profit-making trade or a loss-making trade. [Warren Buffet](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/warrenbuffet.asp) says there are two rules in trading: Rule 1: Never lose money. Rule 2: Remember Rule 1. Stick a note on your computer that will remind you to take small losses often and quickly - don't wait for the big losses. (For additional information, take a look at our _[Forex Walkthrough](http://www.investopedia.com/walkthrough/forex/beginner/level3/trading-currencies.aspx)_ , it goes from beginner to advanced.)

4 Factors That Shape Market Trends  
Posted: Oct 31, 2011  
  
[Trends](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trend.asp) are what allow traders and investors to capture profits. Whether on a short- or long-term time frame, in an overall trending market or a [ranging](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/range.asp) environment, the flow from one price to another is what creates profits and losses. There are four major factors that cause both long-term trends and short-term fluctuations. These factors are governments, international transactions, speculation and expectation, and supply and demand. (For more, see _[Trading Trend Or Range?](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/05/050505.asp)_)  
  
****Tutorial:[Economic Indicators To Know](http://www.investopedia.com/university/releases/#axzz1budS20Up)****  
**  
Major Market Forces  
**Learning how these major factors shape trends over the long term can provide insight into why certain trends are developing, why a trend is in place and how future trends may occur. Here are the four major factors:   

  1.  _Governments  
_Governments hold much sway over the free markets. [Fiscal](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiscalpolicy.asp) and [monetary policy](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monetarypolicy.asp) have a profound effect on the financial marketplace. By increasing and decreasing [interest rates](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp) the government and [Federal Reserve](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalreservebank.asp) can effectively slow or attempt to speed up growth within the country. This is called monetary policy.   
  
If government spending increases or contracts, this is known as fiscal policy, and can be used to help ease unemployment and/or stabilize prices. By altering interest rates and the amount of dollars available on the open market, governments can change how much investment flows into and out of the country. (Learn more in our _[Federal Reserve Tutorial](http://www.investopedia.com/university/thefed/)_.)
  2. _International Transactions  
_The flow of funds between countries impacts the strength of a country's economy and its currency. The more money that is leaving a country, the weaker the country's economy and currency. Countries that predominantly [export](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/export.asp), whether physical goods or services, are continually bringing money into their countries. This money can then be reinvested and can stimulate the financial markets within those countries.
  3. _Speculation and Expectation  
_Speculation and expectation are integral parts of the financial system. Where consumers, investors and politicians believe the economy will go in the future impacts how we act today. Expectation of future action is dependent on current acts and shapes both current and future trends. [Sentiment indicators](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sentimentindicator.asp) are commonly used to gauge how certain groups are feeling about the current economy. Analysis of these indicators as well as other forms of [fundamental](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundamentalanalysis.asp) and [technical analysis](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalanalysis.asp) can create a bias or expectation of future price rates and trend direction. (Read more on this closely watched economic indicator; see _[Understanding the Consumer Confidence Index](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/05/010604.asp) _and _[Investors Intelligence Sentiment Index](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/03/100103.asp)_.)
  4. _Supply and Demand  
_Supply and demand for products, currencies and other investments creates a push-pull dynamic in prices. Prices and rates change as supply or demand changes. If something is in demand and supply begins to shrink, prices will rise. If supply increases beyond current demand, prices will fall. If supply is relatively stable, prices can fluctuate higher and lower as demand increases or decreases. (See more on this subject in _[Economics Basics: Demand and Supply](http://www.investopedia.com/university/economics/economics3.asp)_ and _[Monetarism: Printing Money To Curb Inflation](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/monetarism.asp)._)

**Effect on Short- and Long-Term Trends  
**With these factors causing both short- and long-term fluctuations in the market, it is important to understand how all these elements come together to create trends. While these major factors are categorically different, they are closely linked to one another. Government mandates impact international transactions, which play a role in speculation, and supply and demand plays a role in each of these other factors.  
  
Government news releases, such as proposed changes in spending or tax policy, as well as Federal Reserve decisions to change or maintain interest rates can have a dramatic effect on long term trends. Lower interest rates and taxes encourage spending and economic growth. This has a _tendency_ to push market prices higher, but the market does not always respond in this way because other factors are also at play. Higher interest rates and taxes, for example, deter spending and result in [contraction](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/contraction.asp) or a long-term fall in market prices.   
  
In the short term, these news releases can cause large price swings as traders and investors buy and sell in response to the information. Increased action around these announcements can create short-term trends, while longer term trends develop as investors fully grasp and absorb what the impact of the information means for the markets.  
  
**The International Effect**  
International transactions, [balance of payments](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bop.asp) between countries and economic strength are harder to gauge on a daily basis, but they play a major role in longer-term trends in many markets. The currency markets are a gauge of how well one country's currency and economy is doing relative to others. A high demand for a currency means that currency will rise relative to other currencies.   
  
The value of a country's currency also plays a role in how other markets will do within that country. If a country's currency is [weak](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/softcurrency.asp), this will deter investment into that country, as potential profits will be eroded by the weak currency. (Unique features of the forex market may allow larger players to get a jump on smaller ones; check out _[The Currency Market Information Edge](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/09/forex-information-currency-market.asp)_ also read _[Forex Trading Rules: Always Pair Strong With Weak](http://www.investopedia.com/university/forex-rules/rule5.asp)_ for more on weak and strong currencies.)  
  
**The Participant Effect**  
The analysis and resultant positions taken by traders and investors based on the information they receive about government policy and international transactions create speculation as to where prices will move. When enough people agree on direction, the market enters into a trend that could sustain itself for many years.   
  
Trends are also perpetuated by market participants who were wrong in their analysis; being forced to exit their losing trades pushes prices further in the current direction. As more investors climb aboard to profit from a trend, the market becomes saturated and the trend [reverses](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reversal.asp), at least temporarily. (Find out what effect institutional investors have on the stock market and individual traders, read _[The Market Participant Playbook](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/08/institutional-effect.asp)_.)  
  
**The S & D Effect  
**This is where supply and demand enters the picture. Supply and demand affects individuals, companies and the financial markets as a whole. In some markets, such as the [commodity markets](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commodity.asp), supply is determined by a physical product. Supply and demand for oil is constantly changing, adjusting the price a market participant is willing to pay for oil today and in the future.   
  
As supply dwindles or demand increases, a long-term rise in oil prices can occur as market participants outbid one another to attain a seemingly finite supply of the commodity. Suppliers want a higher price for what they have, and a higher demand pushes the price that buyers are willing to pay higher.   
  
All markets have a similar dynamic. [Stocks](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock.asp) fluctuate on a short and long-term scale, creating trends. The threat of supply drying up at current prices forces buyers to buy at higher and higher prices, creating large price increases. If a large group of sellers were to enter the market, this would increase the supply of stock available and would likely push prices lower. This occurs on all time frames. (The A/D line highlights buying and selling pressure to confirm existing trends; check out _[Trend-Spotting With The Accumulation/Distribution Line](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/08/accumulation-distribution-line.asp)_.)  
  
**  
The Bottom Line  
**Trends are generally created by four major factors: governments, international transactions, speculation/expectation, and supply and demand. These areas are all linked as expected future conditions shape current decisions and those current decisions shape current trends. Government affects trends mainly through monetary and fiscal policy. These policies affect international transactions which in turn affect economic strength. Speculation and expectation drive prices based on what future prices might be. Finally, changes in supply and demand create trends as market participants fight for the best price.

...could be there a difference between experienced Level-A-Trader and Beginners?  
It might be that I could give you a hazy notion of it.

Hello Forexcube,  
  
Your results speak for themselves and I'm quite impressed with your knowledge of the markets, which leads me to a question: in post 959, how did you decide to buy when you did (the second set of buys after the dip on the CCI?) Was it that the zero line held on the retest? It kinda looks like you're buying when the strength is fading (the bars look weak) but based of your results in this trade and others, I'm assuming there's more to the story than I'm understanding.  
  
Also, unrelated question: you often open and close trades for just a few pips. Does slippage ever become an issue when opening multiple trades of 50 lots one right after another? I've never traded anything larger than 1 lot and I saw slippage on that trade let alone 50x that several times over. I've also been curious how many lots one can trade before bad fills become an issue but 50 lots 5 or more times on a 1m chart is surprising.  
  
At any rate, I really appreciate your time and input and the work you've put into this thread. Your results are extraordinary and encouraging to someone like me who is still fairly new to this, so thanks again!

Hey Forexcube,  
  
How in the world do you manage to achieve such results? Could it be that you show us only your successes ie trading performance achieved in a predictable market environment?

Hello Forexcube,  
  
Are you sure it's you executing those trades and not some kind of EA? I couldn't help myself noticing you're trading faster than a blink of an eye and you like having plenty of positions all the time. On page 3 of your last performance report apparently you **executed 24 trades in just over 9 minutes** , which is to say the least phenomenal, even if you're analysing all the timeframes.

Hi polymorphfx  
It was the Pivotal mS1 (1.2926) (1st argument) where the price makes ups and downs and an excellent entry opportunity where the market price was falling after this level and then (2nd argument)...with regard to M5-CCI-Bottom(#[**959**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5254441#post5254441)), ...and then (3rd argument) in due consideration to H4, (the H4 candle has shaped a Hammer before, see the chart below, please and #[**990**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5253889#post5253889), #[**1001**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5254071#post5254071)),.. and the next argument (4th): see the ascending H1 candles in the chart below, please. Moreover (5th argument) M15/M30 has given a range (consolidating market, see #[**965**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5254712#post5254712)) after an upward movement and the next (5th argument: my expectation![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)) should come concerning the H4.  
  
I think it was something like that reported in the hindsight.  
  
Kindest regards

Market Price has make an upward movement, see the 15:00 CET M30 Candle.  
Afterwards the market seems to consolidate, see M15 & M30, please.  
  
If you would trade the CCI Top and Bottom just now exclusively at M15 without any Multiple Market Time Frame Analysis you could have loose a lot of money, due to the fact that the H4 candle has formed a Hammer before and the H1 were in a clear upward trend, so no need to trade the M15 or M30 CCI-Top Level Short.

I couldn't help myself noticing you're trading faster than a blink of an eye and you like having plenty of positions all the time. On page 3 of your last performance report apparently you **executed 24 trades in just over 9 minutes** , which is to say the least phenomenal, even if you're analysing all the timeframes.

Hello,  
I'm not saying it's impossible, I'm just saying that it is unusual and might be risky too... Otherwise fully possible and achievable technically speaking.

Juniors, keep your criticism to yourselves, so that that we may learn more from ForexCube.  
If you have read this whole thread and still have criticism, your out of your mind.

I have found your thread and found it amazing! I have already started to read it and I am half way now on the topic and I am amazed!  
  
That is incredible what you described to us and all I can say is a great Thank you!  
  
I ahve just reada few things and checked the chart and found a few spots and without all the knowledge that I am still gathering from this topic, I already made 20pips without DD.  
  
I am realy amazed, I was trading alot with Robots (still only in demo) but today I shut them down. I want to learn this and study it more!  
  
Incredible!  
  
Thank you for sharing your knowledge!

GBPNZD, Daily, 2011 December 30  
GBPNZD, Weekly, 2011 December 30  
  
Daily could go further up, if the Support Line won't be broken. We'll see!  
If the Daily CCI will turn from the Bottom upwards, ...if so it might be an advantage to trade the M5/M15 additively exclusively Long by setting a Trailing Stop. (See also #[**979**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5255445#post5255445)). Monthly seems in a Range.  
The actual market environment requires a Stop Loss. (You know I'm not a friend of SL but in this case it seems crucial). Why? If the daily Support Line will definitely be broken further abrupt downside movement could be possible (see also the weekly Support). The Daily Support Line could change into a Resitance Line.

No doubt u could.. Thats why when i see some obvious not long time traders come on here and start saying Oh if u can do that i can do it to.. It crosses my mind that they must either be Geinues or have delusions of grandure... Why dont they just be content with winning constant points and add layer by layer.. cause even thou it looks simple its not simple and any one thinks it is mite as well go piss in the wind.. Just my opnion of course..

Loss Order Managerment  
LOM-Example  
Step 1  
  
EURCHF and EURJPY Orders are situated in the Loss-Zone which demand LOM-Activities. I have decide to trade other currency pairs at Scalping Style to counterbalance the negative balance (like #[**984**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5256748#post5256748) ) and preferre at 20/25-Lot-Level the Swing Trading (e.g. #[**985**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5256776#post5256776)).

LOM Philosophie  
  
LOM you could do day by day beside your regular profit trades.  
It takes time but I won't delegate responsibility to a 2% Stop Loss Order which is, ....failing an agreement to a contrary, ... mere a paternalism, a tutelage, a dicatation, a infantilizing or so?![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44e.png?v=15.1)  
  
Why should I don't trust my competence, my experience, my personality, my market analyzing and all my "corpus rationale" and has to follow this bullsh*t of 2% rule which you could read so often in the Forex Literature? Sorry author, sorry writer,...are you daft? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)

To minimize all open orders in plus when they are hanging in your account since several days could be advantageous.  
It's not the time yet to make the maximum win. Close these orders in the win zone. That's all! The next market chance will come for sure. Belief me!

LOM Step 5  
  
Do LOM 1-4 again and again and wait till the Orders in the Minus Zone minimize the loss rate (compare #[**983**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5256741#post5256741),#[**987**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5256851#post5256851)) and could even run in the Win-Area.  
  
How much could you win if you decide to manage it an infinite deal more?  
Minimum 2 aspects! Your self-respect as a competent trader and more profit!  
  
I wish you great pips!  
Best regards

Thanks Forexcube for the explanations. I wasn't aware you were also posting part of your trade setups to that other thread, but I'll be keeping an eye there in the future. And just to clarify, I wasn't challenging you, so I hope you weren't upset by my comments. I'm still too new to this to question someone who's so obviously experienced and profitable.   
  
Also, I see you live in Switzerland. I was there in January 2007 and I loved it. It would be great to get this trading stuff figured out some day and then move there, but I think that's still quite a ways out.   
  
Thanks again for your time and input here!

Maybe he trades only when it is safe/high probability etc. Think of that.....

Hello,  
I don't believe that high probability trades occur 25 times in 10 minutes. Think about that. I've been trading for 3 years, I'm not saying I'm experienced, but I've noticed, that high % trades usually occur on bigger time frames /H4,D/ and even not too often, every once in a while.

Well, maybe you try to see the 25 trades in 10 minutes as one trade. Then think about money management/risk management, when you place your bet not with the whole amount at one specific point but at various places.  
  
Then consider his trading style/technique (divergence trading). Do you know the saying, that a divergence can stay longer as you can stay liquid? Well, at least now you have heard it ;-) That means, when you enter a divergence trade, you should be able to place even bigger amounts of money on your bet when price goes against your initial bet. This can be very dangerous in heavily trending markets, since the drawdown can be fairly huge. But it is all about your personal money management/risk management.  
  
I think it is a common mistake to think, that high probability trades occur a) seldom and b) more on higher TF's.  
  
Since the moves in the markets are fractal, you should be able to find high probability trades more often on lower TF's. On a 15min chart you may find 2-4 high prob entries a day, when you switch to 5 or 1 min you should be able to find them very often a day. Even when you stay on the 15 min chart, 2-4 opportunities a day should be enough to serve your needs. An average swing on a 15min EURUSD chart should result in about 30-60 pips  
  
With the use of a MTF-system you are able to "zoom" into a movement and try to align your ducks.   
  
  
Best to you,  
  
Markus

yes, you can do 25 operations in 10 minutes without sl for 200 days .... and win ... but there will be one day, one only day, that lose everything gained in the previous 200 days  
  
I do not know whether or not forexcube win real ... That's your problem  
  
but if you read the post forexcube learn a lot, and that is important  
  
I never operate in such real without sl

Sl or not sl depends on the style and experience of the trader, a professional trader can operate both with the sl or without it, for him is a choice, not a fixed rule, but the beginner should always use it (my opinion).  
In my current trading use a very tiny sl and my stats over the past 2 years are very good for me.  
I know my performance and my ability to market analysis, I have tested myself. I think the ForexCube money management is very powerful and yes, the "LOM" without stop-loss is only for advanced traders who are able to "Counterbalance the Negative balance ".  
This is a great thread for me, a rare opportunity to learn something new .. open your mind, no prejudice, no blind faith, but test, test and test again...everything  
IMHO  
  
sorry for my bad english  
  
Happy New Year Everybody  
Rob

G'day FX Traders!  
My intention is to put things here at this board as a high level trader. It's really not my job, ...please understand me in a right way! I could also go swimming, read a book, make meditation, amused with friends, visit museums, ...It's also absolutely irrelevant if I make 10.-$, 100.-$, 1'000.-$, 10'000.-$, 100K or 1000K a month with some of my real accounts. "Nqm0t0" don't trust certain topics here at this board. It's okay. Maybe I would think in the same artless way as he when I would have had just 3 years experience. I don't know!, ...but this can't be the reason to run down this thread when other traders could be able to make use of it. Put out these things what you had best do! When some traders have no use for it go away. Why tarry at a place any longer? I like to debate fact-bound like "infinitus" has well-elaborated some topics shortly before (e.g. #[**994**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5257826#post5257826), #[**996**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5258054#post5258054)). In so doing (see also "crodzilla's" delightsome inputs) we could have formed a wonderful consortium shaping the future.   
Bonne année!

Forexcube,  
  
Je te souhaite également une bonne année 2012.  
Rare sont les personnes qui ont la générosité de partager leur passion, dépourvu d'esprit mercantile.  
Tes interventions dans ce forum élèvent à chaque fois le débat.  
Tes présentations sur le cheminement de tes décisions sont très intéressantes.  
J'espère pouvoir te lire encore souvent au cours de l'année 2012.

EURUSD, M15, 2012 January 02  
Swinging Trades  
  
Long @ 1.2929, Target@ 1.2947 DPV (1/10)  
Long @ 1.2929, Taget @ 1.2969 (mR1) (1/10)  
  
PO Long @ 1.2921 (mS1), Taget @ 1.2991 (DR1) (1/10)  
PO Long @ 1.2896, Target @ 1.2947 (DPV) (1/10)  
  
  
More downside movement could be possible.  
Daily could go more down & the weekly divergence could be more highly developed.  
So I would trade more downs at M1/M5 with (5/10 - 10/10; so LOM might be then included).

May the year 2012 be a good one?   
All your wishes come true?   
May 2012 be a year of prosperity?  
No chance............ 2012 will be a year economic and financial turmoil. So enjoy your family and friends is the most important.  
Let's believe that the economic situation in 2012 will be as bad as 2011: we can only have good surprises.

GBPAUD, H4, 2012 January 02  
  
I preferre to trade the GBPAUD at different time frames just now, due to the fact that this currency pair seems to be in a higher probability tolerance zone to adapt the risk. So why not go in with several trades at different time frames and price levels these days?  
  
Long @ 1.5168, Target @ 1.56 (1/10)  
  
PO Long @ 1.50 Target@ 1.54 (1/10).   
  
Daily & Monhly could go further downside.

1.50 - 1.5150 seems for me a good market price to enter some Longs.  
  
  
**Forex Swing Trading**  
  
Forex swing trading is a form of range trading. The swing trader attempts to capitalize on periods of market indecision, and aims to make use of support and resistance lines, channels and price patterns such as tops and bottoms in formulating his strategy.  
  
This style offers greater odds of success for beginners as it doesn’t limit the trader’s attention to a couple of hours (unlike day trading), and because the swing trader doesn’t need to invest a lot of time trying to identify the perfect price for entry and exit. As long as the price remains within the range identified, and the periodic reversal patterns persist, the trade will return a profit. When the range breaks, the swing trader has no illusions about what he must do. His period of bounty is over; he can enjoy his profit and rest as he awaits the next suitable period.  
  
Needless to say, the main requisite for successful swing trading, as with trend following in general, is the correct identification of the range or trend. In doing so, the employment of both fundamental and technical analysis perhaps offers the greatest rewards, but the trader will usually choose the method that he favors the most. In either case, gaining a good understanding of the type of market experienced for a particular currency pair and formulating a defined strategy on that basis is the best course. As previously mentioned, the swing trader does not need to be precise about the entry and exit points; all he needs to do is catch the main movement, taking profit as soon as the price action runs out of speed at a point close the limits of the range identified.

**Forex Swing Trading Strategy**  
October 9, 2009 by [Kelvin](http://www.how-to-trade-currency.com/author/Kelvin)   
  
Some of you may have heard of forex swing trading from some forex books or courses that you have attended. I personally love to trade swing as it usually is more predictable and it also tends to happen on certain time of the day.  
  
**So What Is Forex Swing Trading?**  
Swing trading is the U turn of a trade at a certain point of time. It is not to be confused with reversal trading as swing trading is only for a short period time while reversal trading is for a change in trend.  
  
**Here are some pictures of swing trading:**  
[http://www.how-to-trade-currency.com...orexswing1.png](http://www.how-to-trade-currency.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/forexswing1.png)  
Forex Swing Example  
  
[http://www.how-to-trade-currency.com...orexswing2.png](http://www.how-to-trade-currency.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/forexswing2.png)  
Forex Swing Example 2  
  
Basically this is how you can trade forex swing.  
  
S**tep 1:** Look for either London Open, London Close, New York Open or New York Close depending on the availabiliy of your time. Typically, these are the time where the swing is likely to happen and if you manage to capture the time right, you will see the profit.  
  
**Step 2:** Setup your indicator to look for swing. You need an oscillating indicator like the RSI or stochastic to help you identify a swing. You can also add in the PSAR to help you time the entry. I usually make use of oversold or overbought to help me time my entry. The PSAR is also one good tool to do that.  
  
**Step 3:** Setup the major support and resistance like the Fibonacci level or the Pivot point for the day to help time your exit. Usually I exit my swing trade at a fibonacci level or pivot point.  
  
**Step 4:** Always wait for a proper trend line break before you enter a trade.

i use EMA 6 and EMA 15 , it works well also on a 5 mn graph , you have to check if the the low and high are given by :  
1.CCI cross M6  
2\. M6 cross M15  
3.or CCI itself

Trade Example  
  
EURUSD, H1, 2012 February 03  
  
Profit: + 55'850.-$  
(11.17%)  
  
You could also make your Entry at Point A and go out of the market at Point C (before the Divergence) or after it (D).  
  
I haven't much time these days so I have set it beforehand, but DR2 or DR3 could be also okay. When you are able to make a correct Multiple-Time-Frame-Analysis probabilities should rise to make orders like this.

Here is another tool I whipped up. It gives you an indication of the CCI extreme hook for each currency. An extreme hook is when the CCI goes up over 100 and on the next bar, CCI is down (and opposite). Usually ForexCube will use these hooks in the higher timeframes to trade the lower. So if the 1-Hr has a bullish hook, he would trade the 5-min CCI divergences long only.  
  
I noticed that ForexCube trades these (directly or indirectly) by studying his posts. I talked about this earlier in another post.  
  
You can specify which pairs you want to see, just enter them in the 8 spots provided. The indicator will add a post-fix for you. (if your pairs have EURUSDm, you don't need to enter the "m")  
  
You can specify what you consider extreme. Default is 100/-100.  
  
There are no alarms. I have enough alarms going off.  
  
Hope it is useful.

Pareto optimality - Pareto efficiency  
Level A, B and C are excellent entry points for taking Shorts, D with regard to M5 and M15.  
B and C are the best entry points with regard to the M1 divergence.  
  
This could be an example how a high level traders could also earn money only at the "pareto optimums" (Point D).  
  
It is commonly accepted that outcomes that are _not_ Pareto efficient are to be avoided, and therefore Pareto efficiency is an important criterion for evaluating trading decisions (...so also trading systems).

As I promised, attached is the latest divergence indicator CCI-Divergence-Master version 11.  
  
It is a major rework from the previous indicator. All alarms and indicator values for all timeframes are stored in arrays, which made it much easier/faster to access. So, instead of coding each alarm or divergence for each timeframe, there is just one subroutine for each divergence and/or alarm, accessible by just passing its timeframe to the subroutine.  
  
This has the CCfp (strength) indicator built-in. Real-time divergences are displayed. Thus the TMA has been removed.  
The number beside the Bull/Bear strength indicator is how many bars back the divergence is occurring.  
Signal arrows are displayed when CCI and strength is in divergence by at least one of the currencies in the pair.  
The extreme hook is built in to this indicator.  
All other previous options are included.  
  
My CCfp indicator and tempate is included for the setup I use.  
  
Have a fun and profitable 2012.  
  
Carl

You don't have to trade the whole day long. It could be better to wait for some good market situation where the probability seems better for making a profit. Every trader has to opt his own Time-, Money- & Risk-Management.

LOM  
  
If I have decide to trade 1% per Day, so I have to make with a 500'000.-$ Account 5'000.-$ per day.  
LOM has make 460'899.76$ - 5'000.-$ = 365'899.76$ today (see #[**1035**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5264900#post5264900)).  
  
In a real account I put it out from the account! ...even though the Open Orders are actual: -274.77.10$! I have make it in the last days many times.  
  
If I trade in this way normally I finish every account at 50% or 100% profit and open a new one. If I do so I don't has to be nervous if any turmoils would growing up in the Forex Market one day.  
  
One of the greatest mistakes which (likewise professional) traders could do in my view is to hold a profit account over 50%, 100% or 200% profit!  
  
Every trader has to work out his acceptable profit rate, before to begin the next account.  
  
LOM requires "revolving accounts" !  
  
Kindest regards

Hi Crodzilla!  
I will try to test a system with your indicators (I like it!) at a 200.-$ Real Account. I don't like to test indicators or system at demo.  
If you could write a *.pdf-file or so, how you intend to use your indicators it could give detailed & more information and we could work out different aspects all here how everybody would use your marvellous trading design. You could copy your comments which you have post here and there at this thread, when you have time and the love to do it. If not, it's okay, too!  
Congratulation! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
Thank you ever so much, Crodzilla!

How to read the CC-Indicator...  
...easily interpretable.  
  
The first listed currency to the left of the slash ("/") is known as the **base currency** (in this example, the British pound), while the second one on the right is called the **counter or quote currency** (in this example, the Australian Dollar).  
  
**The base currency is the "basis" for the buy or the sell.** If you buy GBP/AUD this simply means that you are buying the base currency and simultaneously selling the quote currency. In caveman talk, "buy GBP, sell AUD."  
  
If you intend to learn more about this topic, see e.g.:  
[http://www.babypips.com/school/how-y...-in-forex.html](http://www.babypips.com/school/how-you-make-money-in-forex.html)  
  
Divergence  
In this A-B Divergence the base currency (GBP) depreciate (lose value) relative to the quote currency (AUD) but the CC-GBP-Indicator (red line) ascends.  
  
You would buy the pair if you believe the base currency (GBP) will appreciate (gain value) relative to the quote currency. You would sell the pair if you think the base currency will depreciate (lose value) relative to the quote currency (AUD).  
  
Kindest regards

Very nice ForexCube.  
  
Yes, I hope to have some real-time examples as well.  
  
A PDF is a good idea.   
  
I have spent a lot of time developing this indicator. I want to dig in and use it.  
  
I have one more idea to put into the indicator, a combo alarm for CCI, Strength and hook strategy...

How to read the CC-Indicator?  
Currencies are always quoted in pairs, such as USDCAD or USD/JPY. The reason they are quoted in pairs is because in every foreign exchange transaction, you are simultaneously buying one currency and selling another. Here is an example of a foreign exchange rate for the U.S. Dollar versus the Canadian Dollar:  
  
USD/CAD = 1.01242  
  
Base Currency= USD / CAD = Quote Currency  
  
The first listed currency to the left of the slash ("/") is known as the **base currency** (in this example, the U.S. Dollar), while the second one on the right is called the **counter or quote currency** (in this example, the Canadian Dollar). When buying, the exchange rate tells you how much you have to pay in units of the quote currency to buy one unit of the base currency. In the example above, you have to pay 1.01242 Canadian Dollars to buy 1 U.S. Dollar.  
When selling, the exchange rate tells you how many units of the quote currency you get for selling one unit of the base currency. In the example above, you will receive 1.01242 Canadian Dollars when you sell 1 U.S. Dollar.  
  
**The base currency is the "basis" for the buy or the sell.** If you buy USD/CAD this simply means that you are buying the base currency and simultaneously selling the quote currency. In caveman talk, "buy USD, sell CAD."  
You would buy the pair if you believe the base currency will appreciate (gain value) relative to the quote currency (see the green line of CC-USD). You would sell the pair if you think the base currency will depreciate (lose value) relative to the quote currency.  
  
**Long**  
First, you should determine whether you want to buy or sell.  
If you want to buy (which actually means buy the base currency and sell the quote currency), you want the base currency to rise in value and then you would sell it back at a higher price. In trader's talk, this is called "going long" or taking a "long position." Just remember: **long = buy.**

Dear ForexCube,  
  
I don't know if you have traded the EUR/USD recently, buf If you did, could you show me how did you deceided how long to stay in Short and when to change to long? I made many entries but the price was falling without stopping but for me the lower timeframes indicated a reverse.   
  
I am realy intrested in your answer, of course, only if you have time for that!

Thank You FOREXCUBE for TAYSAC System. You have all my gratitude. I have read a zillion of systems. All loosers. This is the first that convince me. And finally I gained some pips (100 today - not much, but enough for print a smile on my face for the rest of the day).  
And Thank you CRODZILLA for your fantastic indicators.  
Sorry for my bad English, I am too old (71) for learn it better, I presume. <http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif>  
  
For all new members of this thread: please please read the entire thread before to post your questions.  
Good new year to all of you. My best wishes with all my hearth.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/270c-fe0f.png?v=15.1)

I think I am repeating myself here, but again:  
  
The CCI numbers are the actual CCI indicator readings for that timeframe. If they are red, then CCI is currently lower than the previous bar in that timeframe. If they are green, then the current CCI is higher than the previous bar. So, the number might be negative and green, but it makes sense because the CCI is lower than zero, but rising.  
  
The CC divergence status is:  
If you see Bear-3 in the EUR column of the hourly timeframe of EURUSD, it means that CC is diverging with price in a bearish way. So strength pressure is actually bearish for that pair. The number is how far back in bars that pressure exists. So 3 bars back, in that timeframe. Simply, price was higher 3 bars back, but strength is lower for EUR, as ForexCube was describing earlier.  
  
If you see Bear-3 in the USD column of the hourly timeframe of EURUSD as well, it means that CC is diverging with price again in a bearish way, but USD is strengthening as prices rise, up to 3 bars back.  
  
The ultimate high probability trade is to see Bull or Bear in both columns of a pair at the same time, along with a divergence in the CCI.  
  
I hope that explains it. I apologize for not having any clear cut explanations as I have been developing this indicator almost since the inception of this thread.  
  
I need to use this indicator so that I can make sure it does what I wanted it to, and is of the spirit of this fine thread by ForexCube.  
  
Carl

Hello astock,  
  
-The numbers after the bull/bear are the amount of past bars.  
-The numbers under the CCI is directly from the CCI indicator for each frame placed on 1 chart.

Here is a real-time example of what I would consider a high probability short. I would now go to the 5-min and/or 1-min an only place short orders.  
  
CCI is divergent. USD is weakening, and CHF is strengthening.  
  
All you have to do is scan the grid and see the 3 bears. (that's catchy).  
The weekly chart is also seeing "the 3 bears" plus a CCI extreme bearish hook.  
About as sweet as it gets.  
  
Carl

Hello Tools,  
  
maybe I help you out meanwhile :-)  
  
Each system has it limitations. One has to acknowledge the situations, when the system does not work out like in other situations.  
  
Imagine a very strong downmove, like you had experienced. Maybe a so called wave 3, the heart of an impulse wave.  
  
When price goes lower and lower, we can see on lower TF's like 1 or 5 min every once in a while, that price tries to go up (at least a little bit). This creates divergences on lower TF's. But the downward pressure is so high, that the divergences do not build on higher TF's like 10, 15min or higher.  
  
I call that behavior "momentum reloading".  
  
There are several indicators that are suitable to make judgement about the force of the trend, like ADX, but since the technique in this thread works with CCI you can see exeptionel downward pressure in readings of above 200 in CCI 14.  
  
So what can we do, when we want to try to counter trade a wave 3 with high probability?  
  
Well, the best advice is, to not try to countertrade a wave 3. Go with the trend with the very same method described here and close the trade when you see divergences on M15  
  
The second best advice is, to wait till you see divergences on 15min or 30 min, then change over to 1 and 5 min to find the best place to place the counter-trade. Do not countertrade on 5 min TF, when you do not see divergence on 15min TF.  
  
Best to you,  
  
Markus

Thank you so much infinitus for the answer! I will check this chart again with your advice in mind, and I am sure that you will be right. I think I still need to learn to use higher timeframes as well! I like this system and I want to learn it!  
  
This is the best topic in FF as long as I saw! Great people are working here all day long!

Hi Tools,  
  
this Thread is truly the speedway to understand how to trade. Forexcube is one of the best mentors and traders you can find here.  
  
To learn from him, start at the very beginning of this thread and even so consider to read the other threads he has opened.  
  
  
take a look at the following picture. It shows my MTF Screen. For me MTF trading works best, when I have 4-5 TF's side by side  
  
On my second screen I have much bigger charts for channeling and Elliott wave.  
  
I never place a trade without loking first on my MTF screen.  
  
If you place a trade on the 5 min TF, wait for divergence at 15min, and at the same time time your trade at the 1min TF  
  
  
Here is the link:

Oh, just forgot:  
  
do not get confused with the whole momentum indicators at the bottom of the charts.  
  
I am a momentum and cycle freak, so I like to see momentum from different angles.  
  
But normaly 1 of them is OK. Take CCI 14

There are bear strength divergences abound...  
  
1-Week, 1-Day, 1-Hour. I think I'll sip at this pond.  
  
Carl  
  
PS. looks like a little hidden divergence there also...

You definitely have not read this thread.  
  
That is a short-term Porfirio strategy that I built into the indicator. Porfirio explains it earlier in this thread.  
You can turn it off if you would like.  
  
Looks as though that trade would have worked out quite well.

I got some combo alarms (new for version 12) on AUDUSD...  
  
Bearishness everywhere. I'll put my toe into a short position to see how cold this water is.  
Nice resistance area here.  
  
I'll post version 12 tomorrow.  
  
15 and 30-min triple divergence combo alarm as seen below.

Hello Carl!  
Yes, indeed! Take the A-Train! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
I'm in since 21:20 CET after I have exit the first from yesterday in profit.  
So I could take the A-Train two times.  
Great design Carl!  
I love it! ...to facilitate observation!  
Best regards

Trade Example  
Scalping  
EURUSD,M1, 2012 January 05  
2:25 - 2:30 CET  
Profit: +30'550.-$   
(+6.1%)  
  
Asian Session could give you some excellent market settings where you could make a profit.  
You have to learn to read the London-, the New York- and the Asian Session in his own rhythm.   
I wait arrival of a higher probability market case (higher probability of expected return) and so it's my first task to lie on lookout in accordance with my trade.  
  
In this market situation the market price has fallen under the Pivotal "mS1" 1.2916 and M15, M5 (see #[**1087**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5268565#post5268565)) and M1 has formed a CCI-Bottom (with a H1 longer candle within the daily range within the last 5 bars).

This trade has a total duration of only 5 minutes but for all that maybe you sit on watch for several hours or sitting in front of a clock that strikes the quarters. Maybe I have just turn on the computer and could have make this trade immediately,...the Flower of My Secret!![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

See also #[**1085**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5268540#post5268540), please.  
  
Probability of acceptance?  
  
Asian Session  
Point "A": If I would only trade here and there for several pips and with low risk I could trade the Point "A" (M5) with regard at M1.  
Point "B": If I wait for an excellent entry probability I wouldn't trade Point "A" due to the fact that here aren't any Pivotals. I would wait a little bit longer for Point "B" with the stronger argument (CCI-Bottom & Pivotal) for a Market Entry with just as higher risk.   
  
London Session  
I would trade analogical market settings during the London Session twice: Point "A" (with some lots) and Point "B" (with more lots).   
  
Be aware:  
Point "A" seems a risky trade.

My two cents....  
  
Better to go with low timeframe divergence _in the direction of the high timeframe trend_. Could add a primitive filter to your table, e.g. is price higher now than a day ago, a week ago, a month ago?  
  
Let's face it: the USD is on a rampage, with job figures buttressing that. Everyone thinks--and this is probably not far wrong--that eurozone is about to fall off a cliff. On the other side, the real economy = employment in the U.S. has been looking pretty good recently. 1) That means 1) real demand for USD assets on macro factors alone for quite some time = bullish USD, and 2) there's safe haven buying vs. eurozone's implosion. Two fundamentals favour the dollar.  
  
_Low TF divergence IMHO in direction of this = high timeframe trend_ is the better play.  
  
Every single trend in this world is going to have huge divergence against it repeatedly on every timeframe all the time. That doesn't mean it's a good play. But divergence with the trend is great.  
  
Remember also, prices were ranging this whole last month, or at least in the holiday season, when you were doing your system testing. So divergence in any direction then works.

Bit9ret,  
  
could you please extrapolate whats the reason for divergance signal in high tf trend direction ? What you would get is to open position in trend direction anyway , but you migth do it without hidden divergence, am i wrong?

I agree to some extent. But I don't think we are too worried about trends here. If you notice the way Forexcube trades, he likes the ranges. So now fractally speaking, there are ranges within trends. If I am not mistaken, that is what Forexcube is trying (successfully) to take advantage of. If there is a potential divergence shaping up in the 1-Hr timeframe, that portends to a 5-min or 1-min range. Which can be traded in and out of using the CCI.  
  
So, the way I think about it is, divergences on higher timeframes means that momentum is slowing down, thus the potential to scalp the lower timeframes in those small ranges.  
  
The complete divergence may fail, but hopefully in the lower timeframes, fractally speaking, you would be in and out of that momentum shift from strong to weak, then strong again. If momentum picks back up and the divergence is not born out in the higher timeframe, so be it.  
  
I hope I explained that correctly, the way I think about how Forexcube is trading.   
  
That is what the indicator is showing... _potential_ divergences. Essentially a pause and maybe a reversal in momentum. We don't know for sure. The only reason I added the strength filter was to hopefully increase the probability that if a currency, as a basket of all major currencies is weak, you tip the probability on your side that a shift in momentum of a pair goes your way to the short side.  
  
I'll let the user of the indicator worry if he wants to think about the trends.  
  
The USDCHF divergences last night saw the pair ranging for quite a few hours, from 1700 GMT to 0730 GMT this morning. The 1-min CCI scalping machine that Forexcube is, would have had a good time scalping that pause in momentum. Unfortunately I can't stay up all night to do that because I have a full time job, so I missed out.

I don't want to speak in the name of Forexcube, but when you look at the graph of FxCube you should notice at what time his trade take place. 95% .... when the "market is sleeping" .  
during low volatility CCI bootom or divergence are powerful but when the market is "moving" with higher volatility the reading of CCI is more difficult.  
most of you here are trend follower .... dreaming to buy the low and sell the high... this is your everyday dream .... trying to catch the" homerun of the day" for 60 70 pips....  
FxCube is doing exactly the oppposite , TP are 3 to 5 pips .....(>90% of his trades)  
Brokers give leverage to destroy your account ... Fxcube is using leverage like a "JAPANESE SUMO" to grow his account ... just because he is trading "high winning rate pattern" during low volatility periods  
so basically he turns disavantages into strenght.  
  
so the conclusion should be   
1\. use TAYSAC System during low volatiliy period  
2.use Taysac System during Ranging day .... day like today with oneway direction TAYSAC System could an expensive experience for beginners

If you're daytrading and you look for divergence on the low timeframe (say 5min bars) in the high timeframe trend direction (say hourly bars), _you have a pretty good chance of entering near the end of the retrace against the high timeframe trend_. The divergence will help catch the end of the short-term retrace. Just in time for the high timeframe trend to resume.  
  
You could take half profits at the previous highest high of the trend (instead of entering there on divergence against the high timeframe trend, which is is a low reward:risk trade), then hope/expect there's going to be a new higher high. Then put a trailing stop on the rest. At least the whole trade (both positions) is breakeven at worst then.  
  
Also if the retrace that you entered on in the 5min timeframe is actually the start (one never knows, as _trend "following_ " is after the fact) of a 60min trend reversal against you, the price you entered is not going to damage you that badly when the 60min trend reverses. It's going to be not the far from the price your indicators (whatever your high timeframe trend indicator is) show that the 60 min trend reversed.

Yes, I understand. IMHO, this approach requires high 90%+ accuracy (I've seen 99% here ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f644.png?v=15.1)) for smallish wins, and swinging a huge number of lots to justify the 2-5 pip profits I've seen here. Unless one is Paul Rotter, etc. (<http://www.trading-naked.com/paul_rotter.htm>), the expectancy of this is questionable.   
  
The problem is this: "****" happens all the time to everyone in the way price moves. Price by definition moves in a way that hurts the most people the most, most of the time. This is what creates the trends, often from panicked folks reversing/exiting as they are blown out of the water. Minor pip wins don't justify the typical risk of a 30-50 pip move against one from system failure, etc. Just wait for MT4 to go down and broker's phone system to be swamped when one has multiple lots (I've seen 50 repeatedly in demo here) in the market aiming for 3-5 pip profit and getting blown out by a breakout against you. It's curtains then.  
  
Maybe one could pop in an overnight stop behind a divergence entry with the high timeframe trend, and see if the trend continues to the European session. If it's a valid high timeframe trend, the size of the wins (pips, dollars etc.) should exceed the losses from stops hit. The reward to risk is there.   
  
Admittedly, the "trends" in Asian session ain't great, if at all, and are often knocked for a loop when London opens. So Asian trend might have to the HIGH TF one, say 4-hour bars. With the high TF trend, the stop can be put it on divergence at the end of a retrace, and one can leave the terminal and go away.  
  
Just my two cents again.

I couldn't disagree (good advice ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)), except for one thing. Trend traders try to catch the middle of moves. It's divergence traders who try to catch the HI and the LO.   
  
Divergence with the trend gives you the best of both worlds: the chance to enter near the end of a retrace at least with a stop fairly nearby, and to gain from the higher odds and reward of the trend. That's my point.  
  
I argue it's not either/or, but should be both/and....   
  
Technical/system failure when swinging a high number of lots is a BIG risk. It's tempting fate, if you're not on a demo.

Bit9ret,  
  
sound advices by you, thanks  
If we take today's movement, purely down trend, could you for example spot entry points by your rule and in what LO tf what you sugest ? may attach screenshots.  
I tried to spot myself, seems VERY rare

Added Combo alarm. And a couple of arrow bug fixes.  
  
A combo alarm, if enabled will go off if there is a CCI divergence and corresponding strength divergence for both currencies of the pair.

Hi Hatzerim!  
  
50% of all market movements are part of a Range Bound Market. We'll use the main rule: if the market is not trending, always treat it as a ranging market. TASAYC-System belongs to the few systems that can trade really well during both: ranging and trending markets, more often it is either one or another.

I wouldn't go in the market with a high number of lots by swinging trades, maybe (1/10)-(5/10) of normal inputs scaled at pivotals.  
  
Roger that?  
  
Example  
If a trader go in the market with 1 Lot so he has to go in a Swinging Trade with one-tenth or a multiple of it to max. 5 x (1/10). That's a fact that you don't have to lose money when the market could turns against you one wave or more.  
  
If I trade I have make up my mind at first "how much could I lose when the market will turns against me". Then I have to estimate "how much money could I make more if the market turns against me".  
  
To achieve the effect!  
This MM-Strategy (and/or position strategy) could be advantageous to you! LOM will do the rest!  
  
MTFA helps you to filter out the noises.  
  
Hope it helps!

Anyway, the doubt had it's origin (at least for me...) on the big amount of trades at the same minute that I usually see at your reports: Are all of the trades with Stop Loss ?

Hi Landsat  
  
(1st)  
If you elaborate the idea of TAYSAC and MTFA you should get the conclusion  
MTFA make TASAYC for Trend- and Range-Bound Market  
  
(2nd)  
Statement 2 couldn't be right! ...and MTFA "prevents" noises. In this example it's the H4 frame.

Hi Landsat  
  
In these market environment I executed predominantly the LOM activities. That's right! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
I don't have had time during the London and New York session the last weeks. That was the only reason for trading outside the quick market but then - you have it well elaborate -with higher risk. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Don't mistake scalping for swing trading?  
Scalping is only for a few minutes, most often only for 1-5 pips or so. Swing Trades are M15/M30/H1/H4, maybe daily.

Hello Fxcube, sorry for question , but here [**_#1105_**](http://"http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5271720#post5271720"), we have many orders in the same time. but with TP varied. How you manage this orders, with script? Because the market is very fast, sometime is impossible change the TP.  
  
Other question, we have many orders because of LOM ok?! But on a range tight, like this(7809-7815), Not is better to manage one big lot, instead many lots small?

See #[**1116**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5271963#post5271963)   
  
1st  
" we have many orders because of LOM ok".  
No...not okay! _**I**_ have many orders because of LOM. That's okay!  
  
2nd  
Incorrect! I can go out with a part of open orders at different price levels and have more authority about all my trades at different time intervalls. If you go in the market with one big order you have exact one option to go out. When the broker posted requotes or like to pushing the price exact in this moment 10 pips, 25 pips in the counterpart direction, before your exit will be triggered, you are out of the market - free fall! - conversely you are able to continue to do!  
Important distinction!  
  
3rd  
Why do you know that the price will go exactly in this range (7809-7815) right now? You don't know it in advance ...only then in the hindsight!  
  
Kindest regards

Thanks FXcube,   
  
Sorry for the _**WE**_.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f644.png?v=15.1)  
  
I agree with the fact of market go against **ME** , but if I have many small lots in the same range(less than 1pip) and the market go against me, will fail too, no?!   
  
I asking this because I wanna understand when I must put a new lot(1/10). I'm including a new order always that have a hook(1M), following trend(hook) of 5M. Is all right, but I put very less lots than you. In this specific order, I would place only one or two orders. So, I would like improve this ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1).  
  
Thanks by the explanations.

Hi astom  
  
At fist you could hedge these positions, but not every Scalping Trade has to be hedge when the price will turn some points against oneself.  
  
Try it out with some 1/10s and make your experience by yourself.  
  
Some Reflexions  
I'm an experienced A-Level Trader and could form a habit for higher market probability settings. I know that my trades are more higher risk especially in this market environment. I also closed every account between 50%-200% profit range. If one would pulverized eventually then no leg is broken. This might be a graditim difference.

Thanks. I looked back this morning of some of the signals generated by the combo alarm... The 5-min signals on the EURUSD were very nice...

Hi Hatzerim!  
I have explained LOM, Risk Magement, CCI, MTFA... Put all things together and try to make something of all that. Look at the attachment file. May be it could give you some more inputs. I don't know! Don't put things out of the context!  
  
2012 January 06  
LOM (Today) = 329'482.26.- - 5'000.-$ (1% Profit Target per Day) = +324'482.26$ (Loss Order Management)  
Open Trades: -731'687.03$  
Equity: +1'379'745.96$  
Profit: + 879'745.96 (since the Opening Day: 2011 December 28)  
(+175%)  
  
You have to match it at you risk tolerance and your Trading Level!  
That's all!  
  
If you doubt if this concept could be something for you then stop it! Let it be!  
  
Kindest regards  
FXcube

Hello, Fxcube,  
  
Thank you for having the paitence to explain us all these details, I really appreciate it. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
I've read all the topic, but it was much information in a short time, therefore the less informed questions...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61e.png?v=15.1) I'll read all the posts you've indicated deeply.   
  
Be sure that I'm not using this trading method unless I'm fully confident about it, so for now, it's only demo although I'm aware it's not the same as real life, but only close.  
  
I intend to know this trading system well. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
Best regards,  
Hatzerim

Hi Hatzerim!  
Oh yes, indeed!...you are absolutely right! You have to trade at Demo at first and when become acquainted with this concept maybe then you can try at a small real account at first or so. If you have closed 3-5 demo accounts in plus (50-200%) every one then might be it could be the time to think about a real life trading.

To close accounts - how come?  
  
It's an important psychological moment when you close your accounts in 50%-200% profit.  
  
Why?  
  
There are minimum two reasons!  
  
1st  
You feel like a real winner, because you made your pile (to be home and dry).  
  
2nd  
You control the situation!  
  
3nd  
See #[**1135**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5274485#post5274485)  
This is one reason more that I put out of the market all the profit every times within the 50-200% profit range!

Market Turmoils?  
Market turmoils become a reality 3 or 4 times a year. If you wait so you could loose all your money! Nobody talks about it. But it's reality at the Forex Market! If you compare the weekly and the monthly charts you will see a lot of abrupt price movements. A couple of weeks later all the old price levels are reached again. I say the market turmoils are a gadget from the brokers and the big capital investment institutions! They tell it has something to do with the news. I don't bit the dust!

What security reasons? Someone will hack into your account and trade for you?  
  
Is this a real possible issue? Say, I put my stuff up on myfxbook.com and you are saying that it will get hacked and make trades for me or somehow wire money into someone else's account?  
  
Not to sound like Mr. Negative here, but I do not believe that is your real answer but that is really your business. I just like Honesty above all else and that doesn't add up or I really need to watch accounts better. Please correct me if I am totally unaware of a common issue and I will stand corrected.  
  
I think you have a better chance of being hacked through your local computer than a myfxbook.com or some other account sharing EA. 

We are our own best indicator.

Hello bluemele!  
  
It's not my "call" I know, but what is the use for us, that only want to know how to use this trading system, of knowing Fxcube's personal deals ???  
  
He has made and shown real accounts before in this topic to show us how this system works in the real world of trading, if you have any doubt go check #523  
  
The topic is on a trading system not on the authors accounts.  
  
I think that the best proof for Fxcubes honesty are the numbers that he shows from his trades...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f911.png?v=15.1)  
  
I hope you understand me well. I don't want to start any argument here. It's just my point of view...  
  
Best regards, and better trades for you,  
Hatzerim ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Best Regards!

Hello Carl,  
  
Can you create an Extreme Combo Alarm? What is this? It's 6 instead of 3.   
Well I have notice if it gets (3)Combos on 2 back-to-back timeframes then the signal seems to be stronger.   
I noticed this on ver11.  
  
For example,   
  
15-min Bear,Bear,Bear  
30-min Bear,Bear,Bear  
  
Having a combination of 6 signals on connecting timeframes like (15,30) or (30-1Hr) or (5,15), etc makes one big very compelling alarm.  
  
Thanks

Aaaaaaahhhhh, come on, that to answer is soooo easy:  
  
  
Take a look at Forexcube's profile.  
  
If I had time at hands and would contact a friend of mine, who is private detective, he would only need a little time to eventually locate Forexcube in Switzerland.  
  
Than take me: my data is openly available in internet (where I live etc.).  
  
So why should I openly state my account information or that what I am able to earn? THAT are the security issues.......

Multiple time frame analysis is simply the process of looking at the same pair and the same price, but on different time frames.

GBPNZD - Multiple Time Frame Analysis  
  
Evaluation  
Weekly & Monthly (#[**1147**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5275453#post5275453)) could go further down. H1 (#[**1148**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5275456#post5275456)) should give a chance for a Long @ 1.9737 (mS2) (1/10) just now and the next Long (1/10) equally probable at the next M30-CCI-Bottom (M30, see #[**1148**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5275456#post5275456)).   
  
Pending a decision  
M5 (see #[**1149**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5275458#post5275458)) Trading should be avoid in a small ranging market concerning the higher spread. There are other currency-pairs with an even better bid-offer-price-difference (e.g. EURUSD). Maybe be I would go several times Long at M5 when the market price would touch the middle line of Bollinger Band (EMA20) at M5 in an H1 upward trend or so.  
  
Push the Buy Button!  
Crodzilla's CC-New-indicator could give me a great input at H1 (#[**1148**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5275456#post5275456)) for a Long investment comfortably ("Buy" GBP).  
  
Note:  
If the weekly support line (#[**1147**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5275453#post5275453)) would be run down definitely the monthly downward price channel (#[**1147**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5275453#post5275453)) could be intact (possibly extended, lengthened). The two shooting stars at top at the powerful resistance line at the monthly chart (the last candles) cause realize a danger. The larger the time frame, the more likely an important resistance (or support) levels would hold.   
  
Critical Ideas  
Would you trade now the H1 at Monday open market?   
  
Do you see now the importance of looking at multiple time frames?  
  
...or do you preferre to trade more blindfold some indicators?   
  
The problem is that a new trend (maybe the downside trend and not the H1 up), could coming from another time frame (in this case: monthly), often hurts traders who don't look at the big picture.   
  
It's your choice!  
  
Kindest regards  
FXcube

I have been following this thread for a while. It looks very promising, but I can’t say that I do understand completely the trading style of Forexcube. I have opened a demo account on December 29. I tried to trade the system to the best of my understanding – and the result seems to be quite nice:  
  
**Account increased by 250% from December 29 until and including January 6.**  
  
I have attached a detail statement.

Hello arbinka  
Congrats! At first you can make a strategic decision to go long or short based on whether the market is ranging or trending. You would then return to your preferred time frame (or even lower!) to make tactical decisions about where to enter and exit (place stop and profit target). Right away you can set Scalping Trades apart from Swinging Trades and Long Term Trades. CCI, MTFA and LOM do the rest as a function of the experience level. Landsat (#[**1097**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5270992#post5270992)) has pointed out the Scalping Trades exactly one of my comfort zones! This (M1-Scalping) will help me determine the best fit for me to make the best trading decisions. So I can use it also for the LOM activities. Swinging Trades and Long Term Trades demand regularly higher time frames for the formation of an opinion, here, too you can develop LOM. Why not? This means that different traders can have their different opinions on how a pair is trading and both can be completely correct. I could show to a limited extend how to use multiple time frame analysis to my advantage. Each trader should trade a (or several) specific time frame(s) that fits his or her own personality. When you finally decide on your preferred time frame, that's when the fun begins. This is when you start looking at multiple time frames to help you analyze the market.  
  
Modus operandi  
You could see some line of actions there: #[**1156**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5275926#post5275926) , #[**1157**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5275930#post5275930) , #[**1158**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5275939#post5275939) .

Don't follow someone else's trading advice blindly. Just because someone may be doing well with their method, it doesn't mean it will work for you. We all have different market views, thought processes, risk tolerance levels, and market experience.   
Have your own personalized trading plan and update it as you learn from the market.

We can't emphasize this enough..."if you fail to plan, then you've already planned to fail."  
Obviously, a trading plan doesn't guarantee success, but a good plan that is followed will help you stay in the forex game longer than traders who don't having a trading plan.

Who you are as a trader will define what kind of method suits you. Strategies, systems, and methods which aren't compatible with your profile and style will drastically lower your chances of success.

> Hello arbinka  
>  Congrats! At first you can make a strategic decision to go long or short based on whether the market is ranging or trending. You would then return to your preferred time frame (or even lower!) to make tactical decisions about where to enter and exit (place stop and profit target). Right away you can set Scalping Trades apart from Swinging Trades and Long Term Trades. CCI, MTFA and LOM do the rest as a function of the experience level.

Hi Forexcube,  
Thank you for your comments and explanations. I have made some analyses on your trades as posted in [1138](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5274795#post5274795). I have the following observations:   
  
1.You have been mainly trading EURUSD but also few other pairs. If you traded only EURUSD **your profit could increase by over 10% (from 1.018.055 to 1.124.743).** So why bother trading other pairs except EURUSD?  
  
2.If we decide that scalping is when you close a trade for max +/- 20 pips and you did only scalping -**your profit Could increase with additional 10% (from 1.124.743 to 1.223.993)**

Hello arbinka  
Yes I have seen at your marvellous result that you have solely traded the EURUSD. I like to trade other pairs additional, I feel more the Pulsation - only a psychological aspect for my own personality. It should be added that I trade also longer term investments and other currency pairs are on the inside track currently. Moreover...take into consideration the topic about the cluster risk. Would be fine when you can post the solide evidence, how your calculation point out 1.124.743. I suppose you don't have incorporate important trading aspects.   
Kindest regards  
FXcube.

Hi abrinka!  
"Yes I know!" "Well, good for you!" I decide more "the third way". Other traders could feel free by tracing exclusively the profit line? Why not? My mind is that scalping could be also a dangerous matter! I like it not to overact and mixing some scalping and swinging trades together when I trade! It makes more fun for me! Money can't buy it! I'm me!   
I think also that your logic isn't correct. (1) If so you have to compare all scalping accounts for one year or so if it should be any statistically significant influence. (2) When I would scalp with these high lot sizes up to 20 pips the scalping account could pulverize. If you scalp with a target to a 20 pips Profit level you have often to trade other market situations. It seems for me a great difference to focus on "+3-POP-Candle-Patterns" (trading only for a +1 - +3 pip Profit) or have to wait till the order could exit at +20 Pip-Profit-Level.  
You sound like an cooperator of a broker bank! ...promise profits on the basis of unsecured data. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1) (LOL).   
There has as yet been no confirmation!   
Kindest regards!

You're right!  
Most of the time outbreak is used more in context like this:  
  
"The outbreak of the [current] crisis and its spillover to the entire world reflected the inherent vulnerabilities and systemic risks in the existing international monetary system," according to Mr. Zhou."

Just to share my first tests of this method...and to say that I'm happy ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
  
Now I must fine tune the amounts to invest, because these were just tests and I used only a small fraction of the equity, not the proper fraction as indicated by FXcube at LOM.  
  
Best regards,  
Hatzerim

Oh yes, that's really the best way of trading! Small fraction! No doubt!

Thanks for checking out the indicator and providing feedback. I like that idea. I'll make that an option.  
  
I'm putting together a PDF manual since it looks as though this indicator has been working very well.  
  
I'm working on version 13, and will have it done in the next couple of days.  
  
Again, thanks to all those that take the time...  
  
Carl

Hi Hatzerim  
Here is an example how you could trade with an 200.-$ Account by using small fractions.  
The Target is 2.-$ a Day (1% per Day).  
Morselled: When trading 10 x 0.20 cents (10 x 0.1%) or 20 x 0.10 cents (20 x 0.05%) the target of 2.-$ (1%) is reached.  
Closed Trades Today  
2012 January 09  
Profit Today: +94.75$  
(+47%)  
Look at the accumulating smaller profit orders with smaller time intervalls, please.  
(LOM = 94.75$ - 2.-$ = 92.75$) These 92.75$ could be the risk capital for tomorrow (or make a withrawal).  
Kindest regards  
FXcube

PO Long @ 58.80 (1/10), @ 58.00 (1/10); Target @ 1.6050, @ 1.6080  
  
Daily could go further down (see #[**1179**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5279473#post5279473)).  
  
Also Weekly and Monthly offer for me a good entry chance.

It's absolutely equal if you trade with a 200.-$ Account or a 500'000.-$ Account.  
The principle trading idea of "TASAYC" is always the same.

EURUSD, M1. 2012 January 09  
Scalping Example  
200.-$ Account  
Profit: +1.32$  
(+0.66%)  
  
The Market Price has running upon the Pivotal DPV and a retrace seemed possible in this market situation.  
M1-Scalping with regard to M5 and M15 could raise your profit.

the CCI and the signals the indicator gives - and so far it kept me out of one  
  
bad trade in the cirkled area - ( don´t know if that would have been a trade anyway).  
  
Maybe some of the more experiensed traders of this system could comment  
on this. Thank You.  
  
Regards,  
Hans

Hello !  
  
Thanks, FXcube. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
In this (test) acount I made the math as if I had 300€s, so for that amount, today, I made more than 3% profit....on my first test.  
  
Next I'll try diferent times of the open market, i.e. while both markets are open and when only one is. I have to get a good feeling of the trading routine, and most of all, educate my eyes for the entering and exiting points. The _indis_ and PVTs, etc. seem very accurate (good work too Crodzilla ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1) I'm going to read your PDF carefully and will thank the new version (13).  
  
I also appreciated your LOM advices, FXcube. That is part of the sucess of trading, without a doubt!   
  
I'll keep looking the thread in order to improve my trading skills....:nerd:  
  
  
Best regards,  
Hatzerim 

Best Regards!

**25 RULES of...**  

**2.** The 5% that win will earn the money the 95% lose since futures trading is a zero sum game   
**3.** You must master three disciplines to achieve long-term successful speculation:   
**a.** Trading methodology (long or short-term, technical versus fundamental analysis, type of trading system, etc);  
**b.** Psychological discipline (controlling emotions of fear, greed and anxiety);   

**c.** Money management (risk reward decision analysis for each trading opportunity - when, where, why and how to bet on a particular event)   

  
All three disciplines are necessary, but not sufficient individually - only all three combined are necessary and sufficient to achieve success.   
You must develop a trading personality which integrates all three disciplines to achieve long-term success in speculation. If you do not, you will fail.   
  
**4.** 95% of futures traders concentrate on trading methodology and ignore disciplines two and three. If you only focus on trading methodology, you will eventually fail in speculation. The only question is when you will fail, not if.   
**5.** Psychological problems are caused mainly by uncertainty . . . which creates fear, greed and anxiety.   
**6.** Uncertainty can be significantly reduced if the trader has information and knowledge which creates certainty rather than uncertainty. Certainty reduces fear of the unknown, greed, anxiety, and creates confidence and success.   
**7.** 95% of traders are totally disorganized as to analyzing their trading results . . . and have no concept of how to organize their profitable and unprofitable trades.   
Practical organization of trading results is a primary prerequisite in mastering the money management discipline.   
**8.** Brokers' statements provide absolutely no value or practical use in mastering the three disciplines.   
**9.** To master the money management discipline, the trader requires information which is:   
**a.** timely;   
**b.** accurate;   
**c.** practical.   
All three tests are necessary and sufficient.Each individual test is necessarybut not sufficient.   
**10.** Trading is just like running a business. If you do not approach trading in the manner of a successful business, (such as IBM, Sony or Apple Computers) you will probably fail in the long run.   
**11.** All three disciplines are inter-linked. If you make progress in one of the three areas, the other two areas will automatically improve.   
**12.** 95% of all traders play as customers in a casino and not as the casino.   
**13.** You must play as the casino and not as a customer to achieve long-term successful speculation.   
**14.** The customer in the casino will always lose and the casino will always win in the long run.   
**15.** Long-term success can only be achieved by playing a game with a positive expectation - (or playing a negative expectation game which you expect to become positive - a more risky technique)   
**16.** The best approach is to play a game where you have a positive expectation and make small bets (playing as the casino). The 5% of traders who succeed fall into this category.   
The worst case is to play a negative expectation game and make large bets . . . Most of the 95% traders who fail are in this category.   
**17.** Before you make your first trade, you must establish your risk profile approach towards trading (conservative, moderate, aggressive). You must know who you are. This risk profile will determine your approach to the risk./reward decision making process.   
**18.** Before you make your first trade, you must establish monthly, quarterly and annual goals for each profit center. These goals should be both operating and financial goals.   
**19.** Nearly every trader who is successful was a consistent and/or heavy loser when he/she first began trading (paying their dues), losing significant amounts of capital in the process. This is a situation which stems from the fact that traders focus on the trading methodology and ignore the other two disciplines.   
Losing significant amounts of capital can be avoided if the trader is making a sincere effort to integrate the 3 disciplines into his/her personality.   
**20.** 95% of traders do not know where they have been, where they are or where they are going in their trading. They operate like a plane in a fog trying to fly with no instruments. They are disorganized, uncertain, anxious, fearful and eventually are forced out of the speculation game. If you emulate this 95% group of individuals, you will wind up equally frustrated and you will eventually fail.   
**21.** The more you trade (daytrading), the more sophisticated your money-management discipline has to be.   
**22.** The less you trade (long-term positions based on fundamental analysis), the less sophisticated your money-management discipline can be.   
**23.** You should classify any contemplated trade into one of the following five categories before putting on a position:   
**a.** Entrance into congestion   
**b.** A trade within a congestion   
**c.** A breakout from a congestion area   
**d.** A trend run   
**e.** Trend reversal   
**24.** The trader will have difficulty in formulating a successful and intelligent risk/reward (entry/exit) plan unless the trade is properly categorized before the trade is taken. The risk/reward parameters are different for each of the five types of trades.   
**25.** Having timely, practical and correct information of trading results instantly available enables the trader to make rapid, unemotional and informed trading decisions.   

  

**Trading will then be less victimized by emotions and instead become more "scientific," unemotional and mechanical.**

Detected unstable market situation where the probability of making a profit isn't in your favor could be a great deal for you! Wait on the sideline and focus only the higher probability entry patterns. CCI and MTFA, some support and resistance lines should give some excellent tools in your hand to work it out. Maybe I will post some examples in the next weeks at this thread to point out my view of things if this topic attract interest. How do I manage it in the practice?

Hello Fxcube, just a curiosity, how do you do this this marks(arrows) showing where you opened the order and left it.(like EA).Could be very good to clarify our last moves in a analysis after trade. Sorry if this is very basic![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/270c-fe0f.png?v=15.1)  
  
Gradually, I am going very well in most of my positions, but I dont know exit yet. I und, but not work sometime, the CCI go to -100(sell order), but I am negative yet. Maybe I need improve the entry, more early. So Sometime I am keep the negative position more than 10pips. But I will get it! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
Thanks for the tips and examples.  
  
Tom.

EURUSD, M1, 2011 January 10  
14:12 - 14:16 CET  
Scalping Example  
  
With the focus at the Pivotals there are no need to go in the Trade at CCI-Top A-Box (red dashed box). It's better to wait at Box-B (blue) and Box-C (blue) with some Entry Shorts. Employ the indicators to advantage - not the other way around.  
This is: "Wait on the sideline and focus only the higher probability entry patterns. CCI and MTFA, some support and resistance lines should give some excellent tools in your hand to work it out." (See #[**1200**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5280772#post5280772)). In this example the resistance was the pivotal DR1 1.2810. The Box-A is a typical instable market situation for going Short due to the fact that M5 and M15 were in an upward trend. Going Long at Point A is the best way neither. The CCI was building a Top at M1, no doubt but learn to read indicators in the right context. Please note: MTFA is really important.

Why not post some entry and/or exit orders here at board, so all here could give a help to you? ..and if so uploading different time-charts, please, so that you could also get a more MTFA back.

See #[**1204**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5282472#post5282472)  
  
GBPAUD, M15, 2012 January 10  
  
Exit @ 1.5034  
  
Profit +4.78%  
  
The Long Term Investment (Target 1.55/1.56) still stay in the market.I  
  
In this example the market situation was excellent for doing both, ...Short term and Long-Term Entry Longs.  
  
That's the great advantages when you trade with several 1/10 orders. You can go in the market an out of it at different price- and time levels.  
  
For Beginner-Level-Tader: Try to get more practice when you can do what.  
  
I hope some of these trading examples could help you here and there.

Hi astom  
I would trade more like described in the charts.  
I would also take into consideration the MTFA with the focus at M15, M30, and H1 and the Pivotals. It should give you always more decision parameters and an even more detailed analysis.  
  
M5: I would go in with some 1/10 orders (e.g. 4 x 1/10). If the market price has reached your first Exit level (P1) I would go out with 2 x 1/10 and would set a Stop Loss, see (2) and would let run the other orders further downside till (3) (Exit 1 x 1/10) and (4) (Exit 1 x 1/10).   
Don't overtrade the M1 Scalping. MTFA (at M15, M30, H1) and the Pivotlas could help you. You could get a more qualified answer when posting M15, M30, H1 also.  
  
Under certain conditions at M15, M30, H1 I would trade how at M5 described. If M15, M30 was in a downward trend I wouldn't trade Longs at M1 and M5, but it's necessary to glance at higher time frames and cop a look at H4.  
Having a grap at M5, M1 exclusively, I would trade how described at M1 but I wouldn't execute any Scalping Orders at M1/M5 without the focus at M15, M30, H1 and H4.   
  
After Exit (4) M1 I couldn't make any reflexions inherent M15, M30, H1, H4 - seems more then to be a waiting status without any overtrade actions.  
  
Kindest regards  
FXcube

Hi!  
  
Today trades, not very tuned yet, but still positive!  
These were trades opened with a new demo account of 5000€s, yesterday. Target 50€s per day. I'm on the 59€s but some trades are still running...not that good. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1) Yesterday I messed up with leverage and percentage of trades, but I think I got now.  
  
The routine for entry an exit is not very tuned yet...but I'll keep on **until** I get it.  
  
I'm not very confident with this system I confess...the lack of a SL is hard to reprogram at one's mind, but results are still positive, so I'll continue the test.... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Here goes the list of trades to this minute...  
  
Best Regards,  
Hatzerim

Hi Forexcube  
  
Great work here!  
  
Do you wait for the bar to close past the pivot, then enter a few pips past the break of that bar? (... if of course it lines up with the CCI)  
  
Thanks

Hi Adam  
Thank you!  
Yes, the most of the time! I take also market entry orders exactly at the pivotal point (1/10) sometimes but most of the time the market price run down the pivotal for several pips. Then I go always in the market with an additively 1/10 (and if MTFA could send signals at higher time frames too, maybe with 2/10 - 5/10).

Attached is version 13 with the Super Combo Alarm...  
  
If any 2 back-to-back timeframes have combo alarms, you will get a Super Combo Alarm. Enabled as default.  
  
If anybody wants an email alert added, I could do that...

I have personally not seen any problems with it. I see arrows in all versions.  
There was a bug fix for the arrows in version 12. It was showing too many, when they weren't supposed to.  
  
Broker is IBFX.

""Today we will discuss why your results in your demo account will probably contrast sharply with the results in your live account.   
When most people start trading, they believe their results trading with fake money will be the same as their results trading with real money. Of course, that is almost never the case.   
The reason for this is that a person's emotions greatly impact their decision making ability when real money is on the line. We will go over why this is, and we will go over some tips for blurring the line between demo accounts and live accounts.  
First off, I want to point out that I am not slamming demo trading.   
Trading a demo is how everyone should learn the basic mechanics of the trading platform.   
It also allows people to practice following their strategy and practice entering orders.   
If a trader goes in a slump, it can be effective to switch to the demo for a while.   
When a trader is in a slump, their brain is so focused on the money they are losing that they make mistakes left and right. Switching to demo relieves this pressure and reminds the trader that they still know how to trade well. The demo is also good for working on new strategies without risking money. However, the demo results usually do not translate to live money results.   
To begin with, there is one basic reason the demo seems "easier" to trade. The reason is that you can have your fake cash refilled at any time. Therefore, what is the risk? There is no risk.   
  

If you screw up, then you can start over without any penalty.   
**This takes a tremendous amount of pressure off of you.**  

  
You could blow out 5 accounts and win big on one, **but that doesn't mean you will ever be able to repeat that one big winning account again.**  
This is the first aspect of the demo to realize, but there are far more important factor than this.  
  

Let's say we have moved passed the obvious reason above that the demo isn't a 100% forecaster of live results.   
Let's say that you have some idea what you are doing, utilize proper risk management, have a strategy that gives you an edge, and have attained consistent results on your demo.   
  

**The reality is that it is much easier to follow those guidelines when there is no real money involved.**  

  
A trader's emotions are much stronger when trading with real money than on the demo.  
If you don't believe me, I doubt you have traded real money for very long.   
With real money you will be tempted to commit a number of trading sins: moving your stop farther away from the entry, exiting a position before it hits your profit targets, entering a trade that doesn't fulfill your criteria to get "revenge" after a prior loss, etc.  
I could go on forever with these mistakes, and you probably have plenty of your own that you could list.   
  

So how do you make your results with real money resemble your results on the demo account?   
  
**The first is to start trading with small positions of real money.**  

  
Do not jump straight into risking what you think you should normally risk.   
If you are trading very small positions, you will not devastate your account, but you will learn what mistakes you make when you switch to live money. Even though you may be risking small amounts of money on each trade, your brain will work very differently than when you are operating on the demo.   
Once you start making mistakes with real money as described above, take notes on what happened.   
Write down the mistake, what your mindset was, why you did what you did, and why what you did was wrong.   
  

The next step is to write down a solution to this problem.   

  
This will allow you to had valuable "rules" to your trading plan that will help protect you from your own emotions.   
In my opinion it is difficult (if not impossible) to correct these mistakes before you actually feel the pain of losing real money due to the mistake (even if it is a small amount risked on each trade).   
Continue this process until you become more consistent in following your plan.   
Of course, you will never eliminate new mistakes entirely, but this process will help you become much more consistent in actually following your plan and not deviating from your strategy.   

  
This may be a brief explanation of how to bridge the gap between live and demo accounts, but  
**I want to reemphasize how important it is to start by risking very small amounts of real money.**   
  

Don't trade the demo forever because there is only a certain level of expertise you can gain from the demo.   
Trade the demo until you have a basic trading plan (with a strategy and money management) that you feel comfortable executing.   

  
At that point, **trade small positions of real money and you will be able to improve your trading skills much more quickly than if you only used the demo for months and months.**  
Remember this:  
You only lose when you lose your money.  
**""Missing an opportunity to make money is never make you loser ! ""  
**

I know that some rules are contradictory...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
Because of that read post #[**1155**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5275797#post5275797) , please!  
  
Balance is the key.  
  

Dont push your luck by forcing a trade, be patience. There`ll be plenty of oportunity in another time.

**Forex will teach you so much about yourself.**

Learn from it to reconize and overcome your weaknesses. There's limit in everything. The price will not climb or falling forever. 

**At some point it has to rest for turning around or continue futher.  
**  
**We****should learn from it.**(_i mean.. me...first!_ ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61e.png?v=15.1))

_It means,i can not break my limit and expect to become a good trader in a day, a month or even a year. I just have to keep punching and kicking my limit step by step while maintaining a good balance inside myself. Sometime i have to stop to get rest before i continue later._  

  

Keep your balance straihgt,so you can stand on it. If your balance fall, you will fall.  
  

And this i have learned from Fxcube:  
  
**"Worry not about profits,they will come.  
Protect your capital,that may disappear "**  

  
  
Thank you Fxcube!

The 1/10 order concept is for me a great advantage when trading a currency pair at different time frames.  
I can go in at different price- and time levels.

Gruezi Forexcube  
Just by accident did I come across this tremendous thread and would like to thank you firstly for all your provided work and info.  
I do scalp the EUR/USD on the 1 minute time frame only and my entry signals are very similar to your described system however without the CCI indicator, only pivots, BB’s and MA’s with a tight stop loss.  
I was very intrigued by the addition of the CCI indicator (hook, divergence) to my 1 minute chart to give me that extra and very reliable signal once price starts to trend.  
Keep it up.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Broker \- the agony of choice  
  
Traders ask me here and there which broker I give the preference.  
  
I have to say that I'm uncontent with all brokers so also I'm disaffected with the "better" brokers likewise.   
  
Realize that the more you become successful, the more situations you could describe as "dirty tricks" occur to you. Requoting, slippage, SL hunt, cumulative disconnections of the platform at crucial moments,...and so on. No broker works for you, it seems like an uncomfortable part of the business.   
  
I think this link could be a qualified help for you:

Hi Pipstrumpf!  
Cordial thank's!  
Pivots, BB & MA are ultra efficient in combination with (& sometimes without) the price action!   
I wish you green pips!

Hi, FXcube!  
  
Are you trying to open a new account in the same broker that you have, or in a new one? 

Best Regards!

Hi, FXcube, week-end's registering didn't work well, and so you have to change something, or email adress, or phone number, or other thing.  
  
A bientôt,

hi FOREXCUBE,  
i have had a similar problem to you,  
i was actually trying to open a new account with an old mt4 file.  
the way i fixed the problem was to reregister and download a new mt4 file from their website and that seems to job. (well it did for me ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1))

**MT4 Trick: Multiple Brokers, Same Terminal** Ever needed to use trading accounts from different brokers, but keep all of your chart studies, indicators, and settings in the same terminal?  
  
Here's an easy trick you can use to trade with multiple brokers, using the same MT4 terminal:

  1. Install each broker's MetaTrader 4 terminal into different folders.
  2. Inside each installation folder, find the "**config** " sub-folder.
  3. Inside the "**config** " folder, find files ending with an "**.srv** " extension.
  4. Copy each of these "**.srv** " files into the "**config** " folder of a single MT4 installation - which ever one you will be using as your "main" install.
  5. Uninstall all of the unneeded MT4 terminals, leaving just your "main" install.
  6. Now when you are opening demo accounts, or connecting to an existing account, you will be able to access each one of the different brokers you've "copied" into your favorite terminal.

Hope this helps somebody!

I have been following your thread pretty well from the beginning. i am the gentle giant that is sitting quietly in the back of the class.   
i started a demo account with $100 on monday and on friday the account reached $365. then i got into a trade on Friday afternoon with all the indicators showing a bull trade. i took the trade and you guessed the market went south faster than a ferret down a rabbit hole. finally the margin got called, later i found out the credit rating hit a number of countries in Europe. oh well will do it again next week.   
this system works i was very aggressive with my lot sizes though.   
regards  
JTH

Oh sorry!  
Typo  
2012 is right, but it's not December it's January   
Start: 2012 January 16 (This is correct!)

fxclassmate, use trend lines. If you have a forming divergence, trendlines can keep you out of a trending (false divergence) situation.  
  
I wish I could demonstrate that for you now, but I have not the time for screenshots. I hope I can demonstrate that for you later. They are not the normal trendlines, but trendlines that take current price volatility into account. (crodzilla trendlines)

I am almost caught up. One thing I noticed is the CCI 14 and the indi CCi divergence 1.1 do not give the same CCI number. I know the CCI divergence is set to 12 even set at 14 it is not the same   
  
I dont think the "apply to" is set to HLC/3.  
  
Does any one know the settings of the inputs to duplicate that  
  
Thanks

Falling window or rising window over the week-end? - That's the question for me some of the times!  
At Friday, 2012 January 20 evening before NY Close I have open some Shorts at EURUSD. Exit Sunday, 2012 January 22 before London Open. Often you hear that you don't have open trades over the week-end. Maybe it could be an excellent advice most of the time. I personally like to take the risk over the week-end betimes with one of the real accounts. Result: +150% between the Friday Market Closed and Sunday Market Opened. Maybe I put out 100% profit and trade with the other 50% further on, maybe I will close this account and will change the broker.  
Kindest regards  
FXcube

CCI was comming up to -100 1 HR chart (showing 30min for better detail)

I am seeing the same as far as sell 5 TF 15 TF 1HR TF  
I placed a sell and 2 PO 1.30009 1.29840 and set TP at 1.2959  
  
These are the pivots  
  
I agree this is a long day but maybe scalp some shorts here

Forexcube  
I have a question about the CCI period settings.  
  
14 is default but I read in this thread that you where using 34 on a 1 HR chart. It myave have been just for that system  
  
If one is doing Multi timeframe study does a person use the same CCI period for each TF or does that change per TF  
  
Thanks in advance

Can anyone post a screenshot that shows how was this big moment tradeable? On all settings everything is a big bearish movement. On CCI, what I leared from Woodies it tells me the same, buying... But according to all other indicators that is in FC's template its a big Bearish Divergence. I lost a lot on my Demo Acc... I will reread the whole topic, the indicator caused for me atleast very false signs. Maybe some settings needs to be changed?  
  
Thanks for all advices!!!

The indicator only shows POSSIBLE (forming) divergences... an early warning signal, so to speak.  
So, yes, there are some big divergences all the way through the daily timeframe, which has a bearish strength indication also.  
  
But, depending on if you are a position trader or a scalper, don't try to catch a falling knife.  
  
Don't discount your other tools. My _trendlines_ have not been broken to confirm a break in the current uptrend.

First of all thanks to Crodzilla and his CCI MTF indicator, so here is my little contribution. Nothing new, just different visualisation of CCI hook indicator (blue/red dot on chart) based on current TF. Maybe it will help someone.

hi altoronto  
does this indicator helps to recognise the breakout..   
Is there anyway to recognise the divergence that is in trend by an indicator ?---------so that the trade is with the trend not with the divergence .

Nope it's just CCI hook over/under (in this case 100, -100) extreme CCI levels.

Hello dryclean!  
CCI = 14 over all Time Frames. You could put in other values, if you feel more comfortable with other parameters. I don't know where you have read the 34. I'm sure it's not my statement.

Hello Tools  
Maybe you have to learn to read the CCI in Multiple Time Frames.  
As long as you aren't familiar with it, maybe the ADX Indicator and some EMA-Lines could help you here and there by diversifying a trending - and a ranging market.  
  
EMA  
Moving averages are frequently used as price filters. To filter choppy price action into a more reliable indication for true price action, a short-term moving average has to cross a longer-term moving average. Short-term EMAs (fast) are more sensitive to price changes because they are measuring fewer candles. Conversely, longer term EMAs (slow) tend to be more flat and are less likely to whipsaw up and down. A simple use of moving averages is using them to gauge the speed and direction of the trend. If prices are held by the EMA20 the trend could be considered strong. If prices break the EMA20 you should become more cautious. This could be a sign or a reversal or a consolidating market. In forex trading the first thing you need to do is define two things, the speed of the market and the momentum of price. Speed is how the market is moving. Momentum is where price is going. Start your market analysis with speed. How is the market moving today? Is it range bound or is it trending? A market will maintain its speed until something fundamentally changes market bias. Speed is a measurement of the market. To measure speed use medium term moving averages. For instance, you can use a combination of exponential moving averages (EMAs) such as 20/55; 20/60; 34/89. Whatever seems to work for you is fine. Based on the angle and separation between these two moving averages you will be able to define the speed of the market.  
  
EMA 9/20/55  
A steep angle and large separation will indicate a fast moving and trending market. A shallow angle and narrow separation will indicate a slow moving and ranging market.  
  
Remember, steep angle and wide separation indicate a fast moving market that is trending.  
Why is this knowledge important?  
Two reasons:  
(1) You can choose the right tools for the job.  
(2) You can adjust your risk tolerance.  
  
ADX  
Price Momentum:  
+DI stays on top of -DI — uptrend is in place.  
-DI stays on top of +DI — downtrend is in place.   
  
You could also do this:  
Strategic Forex Trading:  
ADX -/+ DI lines are used for spotting **entry signals**.  
All -/+ DI crossovers are disregarded while ADX remains below 20.  
Once ADX peaks above 20 a **buy signal** occur when +DI (green) crosses upwards and above -DI (red).  
A **sell signal** will be the opposite: -DI would cross +DI downwards.

Dear FC,  
  
Thanks for taking your time for me! I have made a few analisys and found my self being in a black hole. I admit that you were right, sadly I did not have this conclusion before.  
  
Thank you for all advices!  
  
Good night to all!

Here is an example of the way I draw my trendlines.  
  
WARNING: I do not want to turn this thread into a trendline thread. I will post more as time permits. I have a day job (I wish I didn't).  
  
The way I draw these trendlines have evolved over the months. They used to be strictly price/channel based, but now there is a volatility adjustment, based on the way CCI works and how price moves. My trendlines work on all markets and all timeframes. I have used them to trade stocks and indexes (a longer period CCI).  
  
I am only alerted to draw these trendlines based on the arrow created by my indicator.  
  
Based on my recent testing, when price breaks this trendline, there should be rapid movement, due to momentum breaking the other direction.

To follow up, an interesting development. Price is weak at the trendline.  
Must use lower timeframes to asses how much short side we can take.  
  
Here is a followup to EURUSD 15min.  
  
There was a new short divergence arrow, so I re-evaluated. There was a longer term divergence with CCI. CCI dipped below -100 to form a bullish CCI divergence. Price could not follow through to higher prices, so momentum must be about to break. Lets see.   
  
I don't really like these trades after the NY hours.  
  
Carl  
  
P.S. The endpoints of my trendline: Price1: Lowest price when CCI dips below -100. Time1: Highest price bar on or after CCI peaks above 100.  
  
Price2: Lowest price when CCI dips below 100, Time2: Highest price bar after divergent CCI indication above 100.  
  
Sorry about the explanation, it is not easy to explain.

I saw the CCI 34 from post #21 but that was not your system but something you posted. But thanks for clearing it up for me

Here is an example of GBPUSD 5min for this AM EST before NY open.  
  
Lots of bearish arrows, but momentum has not turned yet. You could probably scalp like there is no tomorrow (Forexcube) on the 1 min...

Hmm. You said **_feel_**. I've said that to myself a few times in the past... My account took a big hit because of it.  
  
Please show why you would go long based on divergences. I'm not seeing it.

EU moves in 20 pip waves. The green lines are 20 pips I use this indi to create them. I use the green lines for PO and the pivots for TP  
  
The Daily Weekly PA is up and CCI is moving up on them plus  
currently so CCI is up 5 min and 15 min  
  
It is scary because the Greek debt news is coming out this AM and EU may take a hit I only have 2 orders on the other only kick in if I am correct.  
  
These divergences are new to me and I am still trying to understand them

Think of CCI divergences as warnings that momentum is slowing, and may be turning the other way. You can see when there is a strong trend, divergences fail. Momentum pauses, but does not completely shift the other direction.  
  
I tried to come up with a way to use the trend and price volatility, so that the market could tell us when momentum has finally broken, and there is no more power to continue the trend.  
  
The wide TL for the EURUSD 15min says to me that there is a lot to play out today. Shorts should be favored.

Hi !  
  
Today I've made alot of trades based on CCI divergence only, and some profits, but I failed to see the change in the market's direction in usefull time...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1) so I left some short positions behind...  
  
Anyway, this template [http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...83#post5319683](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5319683#post5319683)) is very interesting, and it already gave me some profits! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Danke ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1) I'll take a look!  
  
I've seen an entry below de 20/25 line in your ADX graphic. Was it because of the low levels of Stc + CCI ?

Yes, Stc + CCI but in conjunction with the Pivotal DS1 1.2884!   
  
(You have to take also a look at H1 and H4 candles, how they are formed).

For some reason the option to hide the grid was removed...  
  
Here is the update, so that when DrawGridText is false, the indicator will still give alarms and arrows on your chart, but the full status grid will be hidden.  
  
I'm surprised nobody told me about this...

Delete the PO Short @ 1.3124 (DR2) (2/10).  
  
Exit @ 1.3095 (2/10)  
  
Profit: +21 Pips  
  
After London Close and later after NY Close I expect to catch only several Pips by debased vola and momentum values. In this trade example there was a M15 Divergence where I take 2 shorts (see #[**1362**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5326701#post5326701)), then has switched at M5 and go out with this trade at the next CCI-Bottom at M5.

On this chart it looks like you were placing orders on the way up. Were those PO Stop limits. I tried the same thing with a universal TP at a support level and it worked great

Try this one Dryclean.  
Put it in your script folder.  
You will also need stblib.mqh in your include folder to make it work.

Swing Trading could be also an example for the art of wating, but in this case I wasn't out of the market, no, I was on the contrary in the market and have let the profit run.

EURUSD, H4, 2012 January 27  
EURUSD, Daily, 2012 January 27  
  
The Daily's Price Action (Shooting Star) and additively at the upper Band of the Bollinger Band could be a powerful signal that the upward trend could be broken.  
  
Short @ 1.3109 (3/10)  
  
(...and will try to trade some ups at M1/M5 intermediate).

Try this one Dryclean.  
Put it in your script folder.  
You will also need stblib.mqh in your include folder to make it work.  
  
Many thanks for a Great Thread Forexcube!

EURUSD, M1  
  
I like trading the M1 on the eurusd. It's rather fast but I do a 3 pips trailing stoploss. I get over an 80% win rate. Anyway I break my winning streak in 2 conditions. Low volatility and/or trading against a strong trend... I know.. not very smart.   
  
To help me with the volatility I trade during the london/new york hours.  
  
Now to help me with the strong trend madness I use the GMAC indicator. It shows all the timeframes but I mainly look for everything from the M1 to H4.  
  
When all 6 timeframes are green for buy/ red for sell and has that 'yellow' as strong, then I do not enter against the trend. I want to but I think there are many more trades to come... let it go. It seems to help but I'm new with the technique.   
  
Maybe this can help someone also. Here it is.  
  
Forexcube I hope you don't mind that I post the indicator here?

Why not gathering 2-10 pips here and there?  
  
Long @ 1.2066 (5/10)  
  
Exit @ 1.2071 (3/10)  
Exit @ 1.2076 (2/10)  
  
...or so,...only for several pips.

Questions whichever a trader could ask himself.  

  1. Do you find yourself constantly getting chopped to pieces by the market?

  1. Are you struggling to break even or have a consistent hit ratio on your trades?

  1. Do you find it difficult to identify trends?

  1. Unsure when the best time is to take profits or even cut losses?

  1. Looking for the best free swing trading indicators?

  1. Heard about Japanese candlestick formations but not sure which ones hold the most power?

  1. Have fibonacci retracements got you confused?

Looks like some people getting the grasp of this. I too had a decent week.   
I am looking for PA to get near pivots and looking at the CCI for the hook and placing 5 orders about 1 pip apart with a fixed TP   
  
In fact in this this would have been a nice sell opportunity but it was close to the closing time bell.

Multiple Time Frame Analysis  
  
I make the Multiple Time Frame Analysis only with the CCI Indicator, the Price Action and the Pivotals. It's for me easy, fast and efficient when I have to analyze multiple currency pairs. For beginners it could be an orientation to have more indicators like in the example below or so.  
  
Note  
In order to guard against confusion, the CCI-Indicator gives me the best trigger points of a market situation where seems for me the highest probability of making a profit, but when trading in between with several 1/10 orders this system could be even a help very well.  
  
See #[**1409**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5335286#post5335286) \- #[**1413**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5335292#post5335292).

Multiple Time Frame Analysis  
  
Successful trading need to have a good understanding of a Trend in at least 3 different timeframes. One for the Major Trend, the second for counter trend (retracement) and the last one for an Entry and an Exit.  
  
Example  
  
Daily:  
Your trend is in the Daily timeframe a Bull-Trend when the EMA3 is above the EMA13 in the daily timeframe. The Countertrend or Retracement is in the H4. A Countertrend is when the 4-Hour is signalizing a Sell. That is when EMA3 is below the EMA13 in the H4 Timeframe when the Daily is still Buying.  
  
Buy Setup  
The chart of daily Timeframe below shows at 2012.01.18/2012.01.19 a „Buy“ because the EMA3 (red line) is above the (EMA13) the blue line. See the green arrows, please.  
  
(See also the "Sell" at 2011.10.31/2011.11.01 where the EMA3 crosses EMA13 downwards).

4-Hour  
When the trend is determine, it’s good to wait for a retracement or countertrend in 4-Hour-Timeframe so you wait for a Sell-Trend in H4 when the Buy-Trend still remains in the Daily-Timeframe. The H4 chart below shows a countertrend.

1-Hour  
Now you could watch the 1-Hour-Timeframe for an Entry. You want to trade a „Buy“ when the EMA3 is above the EMA13. Obviously you will have several Buy-Noises in this Timeframe, but the one you want to trade could be the „BUY“ at the point where Fisher 10 of H4 is green, like the 1-Hour-Chart below:  
  
The +DI/-DI Crossover deliver the confirmation or could give you the signal more easily as a leading indicator.  
  
Order of Priority  
Frequently: CCI > Fisher 10 > -DI/+DI > EMA3/13 Crossover, or related.  
(Check it out with different parameter values. Maybe you will come to other results).

Your Stop-Loss could be the lowest Low (or so) and you can figure out your Take-Profit-Level as the same pips with Stoploss or more, depending on your risk plan.   
  
The character of the indicator(s) will help in selecting the right combination.

Day/4H/1H.. I guess it is valid for another timeframes (combination), like 15M/5M/1M if you enter on that day trend...?

Oh yes, sure! There could have been even more Entry and Exit Points when trading this system, additively you could set in a countertrend more frequently when using shorter time-frames.

Hi dryclean!  
I'm not sure if I have understand your question correctly.  
I have make some EURUSD Scalping Trades Shorts (1.3217/19) in the last hours (23:00 - 1:30 CET) and went out with several pips profit per trade around 1.3210-1.3198. The last open from Friday 1.3222 was triggered at the TP 1.3218. Now I wait. Maybe will set some Longs 1.9192 yet for several pips (2-5 per trade). I don't know.

I'm really happy with my CCI in the MTFA.  
  
How to read a divergence with the help of CCI & RSI might be for beginners easier when using both indicators.   
  
When the market price is going up while the CCI is falling down, often the RSI indicator crosses the CCI more upwards and is forming a peak later, before falling down, when the market price is falling down at the same moment. It's the question of timing of the different indicators, based on the different formula.  
  
CCI C3 > C4 is falling down and the RSI R1 > R2 goes up when the divergence is shaping.   
  
Hint  
If so you could make several pips more when switching at a lower time frame (M1/M5) and take some Longs again for several pips.

Scalping Trades  
  
Before you start with scalping trades it's your job to get an overview over the market at higher time frames.  
  
When trading at M1 take a look at M5, M15, M30, H1,...(see #[**1443**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5340954#post5340954)).

H4 Trading   
  
Point B gives excellent probability patterns for an Entry.  
If you could wait for a better entry chance you will make more profit without stress.  
Point C is an instable market situation when trading H4. I favor to wait for a better entry chance! Our time will come, ...absolutely!

It's better to take an extra Account for the Longer Term Investments.

Misbelief?  
  
Scalping isn't for me a trading idea where I will catch the maximum output of profit which seems possible.  
Scalping is for me at first go in and go out so fast as I can at excellent entry patterns without inappropriate expectations.  
So I have to wait...and wait...and wait..at first before I decide to make some scalping trades.  
  
Look at the D-Box below, please....What do you think about? "Ohh, damn, why couldn't I catch this profit? If so then I would say to you:

Hi Forexcube,  
  
looks like we can take a short trade because of the CCI top, right?

Hi FXcube,  
  
I think I know what you mean, but some traders move by the "Let your profits run.." rule...that's their problem. They _expect_ that the market continues in their favor and then, sometimes....it doesn't! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
Still, for me, going in and out and make a few profits is safer and better.  
  
Best regards,  
Hatzerim 

Best Regards!

Hi Olarion1975  
  
...and if so , did you have make a profit in the last Hours? Yes, you did!  
See #[**1454**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5342038#post5342038) the M15 and M30 downwards candles.  
  
Moreover, you could have been scalping exclusively in the "overlapping areas" just as well, where M15/M30/H1 and/or H4 candles are overlapping each other.   
It's an absolute adantage when trading lower timeframes by monitoring the higher ones.

"CCI-Top-&-Bottom-Trading"   
"Overlapping-Candle-Trading" ("OCT")   
  
  
By Trading I often combine two trading strategies, the "CCI-Top-&-Bottom-Trading" and additively I go in with some more trades with the "Overlapping-Candle-Trading" ("OCT") with regard to CCI. At "OCT"-Trading here it's necessary by monitoring the M15 candles to take the entries at M1/M5.  
  
"Overlapping-Candle-Trading"  
You could also set a stop Loss a few pips over the last higher candle (the Leading Candle is labeld with "1") and let the win run or set a trailing stop. The Entries are at the Close of Candle "1".   
  
You have to look if it's a down- or an uptrend. The CCI and the Price Action (or 3/8 EMA Lines or so) will give you an orientation.  
  
I were down at "2" in this example.

Entry  
By lower volatility (momentum must be clear) you could wait if a wick at Candle "2" could be built and make your entries a few pips above the Close Price of Candle "1" (above the body of the Candle "1" by a downward movement) or below (upwards trend).

This could also be a Scalping Session. The Daily was too long and the Pivotals was reached. M15, M30 and H1 are forming a CCI-Bottom.   
  
  
In the last downward movement take the ups -it's more risky but efficient- (you could also trade some downs above the pivotal as long as the pivotal below wasn't hit) and when the market price was falling under the pivotal take only ups.

Fibonacci Scalping  
  
Fibonacci-Scalping could be a powerful Trading Tool if it is managed in a correct form. In this example below you could see a 23.6% Daily Fib-Level, which was drawn at the H4/Daily Chart from 2012.01.16 (00:00 CET) - 2012.01.27 (20:00 CET).  
  
Cycling down through the time-cells (M30/M15/M5/M1) I have seen a great market opportunity just now at the 23.6% Level.  
  
See also the M5 Range, #[**1462**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5343182#post5343182), please.  
  
The risk level might be adapt at the higher probability market patterns.  
  
Here you could be also aware that the Multiple-Time-Frame-Analysis has to be a must-do when Scalping at M1.

**Fibonacci Retracements in Forex Trading**  
  
**Fibonacci retracements** are percentage values which can be used to **predict the length of[corrections](http://www.forexhit.com/learn-forex/forex-trends.html) **in a trending market. Most popular retracement levels used for the [forex trading](http://www.forexhit.com/trade-forex/trade-forex.html) are **38.2%, 50%, and 61.8%**. In a strong trend you can expect the currency prices to retrace a minimum of 38.2 percent; in a weaker trend corrections may go as far as 61.8 percent. The 50 % is the most widely monitored retracement level and is a common area to buy in the up trends or sell in the down trends. If a correction exceeds one of the retracement levels - look for it to go to the next (e.g. to 50% after the 38.2% level or to 61.8% after the 50% level). Whenever the prices retrace more than 61.8% of the previous move (on a closing basis) you can expect them to return all the way back to the beginning of the trend.

Blind Flight  
Only for testing purposes  
  
Sometimes I have half-baked, poorly conceived, unripe, immature trading ideas which seems to be worth to rumble on. Blind Flight - for the limited purpose to enter unknown territory - exclusively at higher time frames (H4/Daily/Weekly/Monthly) - could skim across the counterpart direction (-500/-1000 pips) and has to be managed with 1/10 orders, putting additively more in the market when going in the counterpart direction and has to be managed with LOM (Loss Order Management). It's more Swing Trading under indefinite conditions. Blind Flight Orders should be oversee into an extra Account with the willingness (not the ability) to serve the trade. When the currency market seems unstable ("completely unpredictable") for me I like to test it out in the expectation to collect further information about some dynamical aspects of the Forex Market and the speculation about some topics of "trading under uncertainty", indeterminacy...vagueness...or so.  
  
Equally applicable  
Orders could be transacted by the same token in expectation of loss.

GBPUSD  
  
Weekly & Monthly indifferent, Daily CCI-Top (could go down).  
Ambivalent market informations.  
  
Result:  
Only too well for M30/H1 Trading at the time. (The trading at higher time frames should include more risk. Other currency pairs might be well positioned, e.g. CHFJPY, GBPCAD, Weekly/Monthly).

Scalping Trades  
  
The Price-intervall between 1.3199 - 1.3184 were trade.  
I've make many scalping trades (Short) above the Pivotal 1.3187 (DR1) just now. I like to go in and out of the market extremely fast and take more risk in the market near the pivotals. A retracement seems often coming up. One, two trading-sets like this per day should be enough. So the job to be a scalper should be more to wait for excellent market situations which could offer the highest probability of making a profit.  
Kindest regards

Manually!  
For me it seems to go faster then a sript. I've try it with different computer mouses. Most of them are unpractical. If I have more time I set with a part of the orders TP's after the "entry small arms fire".

You're on the insight track when using different trading styles, cos not every market situation demands always the same old history. The CCI-Indicator seems for me the most flexible one when using it at different time frames. CCI is fast, simple, efficient and easy!

The CCI/MTFA and the Pivotals are adequate for me,..and a few support/resistance lines sometimes.

Figure on probabilities!...How to contemplate an event?...To take something into account...  
  
Scalping could be done after you've observational a more global view about the actual market situation. Otherwise it could be "easy come, easy go!". Take a look at the actual M15 Range, also at the long H4 and Daily candle. Should it be this moment where a breakout before London Market close should taken place? I don't think so! ...and if this is the case the probability that this "outbreak" occurs within your short scalping session (e.g. #[**1485**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5346438#post5346438)) should be minimal. You will get more professional abilities when learning to wait and make precise distinction about your market entries.

Forexcube,  
  
What do you use as your stop loss on multiple scalp orders? Are your results on a demo account? Keep up the good work.

You will get more professional abilities when learning to wait and make precise distinction about your market entries.

Hi txfxtrader!  
I beg you to look after me a little more respectful and read this thread at first, before asking needless questions. If you would then ask the same question it would be an honour for me to give you the right answer.  
Kindest regards

Hi Forex Cube   
  
Great trading as usual. It is really difficult to define an excellent entry depending on your strategy. You seem to be unbelievably talented at doing so. As you know an entry is half the battle executing the trade is the other half. You also seem to have great trade management to go along with the entry as well.  
  
I have ventured to 5 minute charts myself and it seems to me that if my stop is fixed with a good entry all i have to worry about is to take my profit. Usually when i enter a trade the next bar is relatively large and in my favor (of course not all the time) I believe there are a lot of stop losses that hit after my trade enters to cause the larger then normal bar. Any insight would help.  
  
I wanted to ask if you have ever used order flow to trade?  
  
Also I made a comment about Asperger's syndrome. (Which i feel i have a slight case). That was not meant to be negative. Hopefully you did not take to offence. If so I apologize.   
  
Just for reference i have read a lot of your material. It is really hard for me to retain technical information. Somehow though i have retained extreme confidence reading through your material thus the reason i have ventured to lower time frames to capitalize on shorter term profits in hopes to take advantage of more opportunities. Although i feel the daily charts for the long run is more then adequate to obtaining financial freedom. 5 minute charts are so much fun.   
  
I will continue to read your threads. 

My trades are 100% profitable 65% of the time!

kader,  
Alarm_TF - Will sound when there is a potential CCI divergence detected for TF. (depends on FilterWithStrength)  
Arrow_TF - Will display an arrow when there is a qualified divergence detected on TF. (depends on FilterWithStrength)  
  
If FilterWithStrength is TRUE, arrows will only be drawn when, potential CCI divergence, and Bull divergence for primary currency AND Bull divergence for secondary currency strength (CCp), has occured.  
  
IF FilterWithStrength is FALSE, arrows will be drawn only when potential CCI divergence is detected.  
  
Hook_Alarm_TF - Will sound alarm when there is an extreme CCI hook on TF.  
ExtremeHookHigh = 100 (default) means when CCI is over 100, then hooks down on the next bar, an alarm will occur.  
ExtremeHookLow = -100 (default) means when CCI is under -100, then hooks up on the next bar, an alarm will occur.  
  
Combo_Alarm_TF - Will sound alarm when a Bullish divergence with filter is detected on 2 back-to-back timeframes. (ex. 1-min & 5-min, 5-min & 15-min)  
  
I run v13c day in and day out, with no problems. (IBFX-Real acct).  
  
Carl

Hello jimmyjames79!  
CCI, Pivotals & MTF is the heart of my trading concept. I have upload many examples where I have set orders in the hope that readers will get more and more a feeling what TASAYC-Trading could be and what not. I don't want to give a closed trading system cos I don't trust in a trading system which leads the trader to belief in well-orchestrated indicators with precise entry- and exit- and Stop-Loss-Levels. If so then every Trading System should be the Holy Grail, which nary a trading system could be!  
I want to expose the subject "unstable market situations" this year 2012 here at board. Maybe when I could give examples about an "instable market" the TASAYC-Concept should come into sharper relief.   
Kindest regards  
FXcube

Dear Mr. FC,  
  
Are you still keeping your Short opened with the TP 1.2980? I am in a "bit" loss, cause I stepped in a short also, I read about an analisys where some bigplayers marked the same TP level as you did for short.

Hi Carl!  
Great forecast!![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
The market ranges 50% of the time.  
I have set some short orders at 1.32 this week - longer term, maybe ~1.20 -, I don't know!.  
I could counterbalance these trades with lower time frames (M5/M15) and the Loss Order Management (LOM), if the market price will really go further up (incredible 1.35/1.40 or so). The truth of the matter is I don't care no matter how the market price will make a breakout up or down. I trade what it is, not the other way arround. Whatever! Never mind!   
Weekly and monthly could go further up, the daily more easily down. This is a classical instable market situation for me when looking at the extreme CCI-positions at the different time frames (Daily, Weekly, Monthly). Be careful, my friend!   
Kindest regards  
FXcube

EURUSD aspects  
  
In these market environments (instable market situation/MTFA) I like to trade more smaller time frames till the bigger trend gets clearer.

Here is my near term cycles analysis for EURUSD.  
  
The cycles analysis software I wrote specifically for FOREX. This is a work in progress, but I must say I have been excited by my research when applied into the framework of CCI divergences (EURUSD 1-Hr).  
  
So, again, Forexcube has given life to my cycles analysis, that I have been working on for years.  
  
I cannot share it yet. It is in no way user friendly. I have to go through several steps to analyse a single timeframe.  
  
The software analyses and ranks cycles based on their fitness for profit.  
  
Example, the 35 bar cycle has been 100% profitable for the last 105 bars.  
Will it be in the future? Probably not, but it probably will be through the next half-cycle or full-cycle. Then we can re-analyze.  
  
It is my belief that cycles in forex shift and change all the time, based on news and fundamental changes.  
  
Currencies are the most manipulated equity in the world (Central banks).  
  
I hope to see if CCI can help anticipate whether a cycle will occur or not!!!

Here is a 5-min cycle analysis after the news.  
  
The 31 bar cycle (red) has been almost 80% profitable, 332 pips over 525 bars.  
  
Maybe cycles can give you more confidence to trade a CCI divergence knowing that a cycle is due to turn?

EURUSD 5min.  
  
Well, my divergence indicator painted a bearish divergence arrow right at the top of the cycle. Signal is probably good to the weekly pivot.  
  
That is what I like to see. Absolutely beautiful.

P.S. What I would really like to do is write a walk forward analysis program to analyze past cycles and see how long they lasted projected forward in time. Then overlay CCI and see how things really work.

Hi Carl!  
Marvellous, your ideas and this solid work!![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
H1-CCI-Divergence should be an excellent standard in a market sideway movement. No doubt! Maybe you could apply your cycles through more "time cells" (M5, M15, M30, H1, H4, Daily) where the higher time frame cycles should put out the noises when a trend is coming up.   
I wish you success & happiness!

Continuing on into this slow afternoon EST, the cycles continue.  
  
As can be seen, the (red) 31-bar cycle continues to perform wonderfully, on this 5-min chart.  
  
I have lots of work to do. More testing and programming required.

...and now we can make a simple calculation, if I would take a 5K Short around 1.3150 today it could goes 10 times more in the counterpart direction (1.4140) and if I take then one more Short 5K this account should run in the win any more. The rest is LOM (Loss Order Mangement).

End of the day, looks like our 5-min cycle has inverted at the daily pivot.  
Price was going along with the cycle, then about half way through the short right at the pivot, price went higher.  
  
Then, the low of that cycle became the high, etc.

Great Idea, Carl!  
Maybe there has to implement a multidetector how to spot a range-bound market on their earliest stages, so that we can actually have a choice: to trade or to avoid it.  
Kindest regards

MA-Angle  
  
One of the methods to detect a range-bound market is by looking at the angle of the Moving average.  
If, for example, our Moving average (MA) is rising fast - the angle of the MA line on the chart will get steeper and steeper.  
Already at this early stage we can make a conclusion: if the angle of the Moving average is rising – the trend is getting stronger. If the angle is dropping – the trend is getting weaker.  
If the angle of the moving average is insignificant, close to flat or is flat – we know that the market has entered its sideways mode.  
  
Now lets have a look at 50 SMA (regardless the time frame) and its angle on the chart.  
The direction in which moving average is going is not important. the angle at which it rises or falls is what interests us.  
  
First of all, it is a visual guidance – when the Moving average lies horizontally, we know that the trend has paused or non-existent.  
  
But, we don’t stop on just visual evaluation. There is already a tool to help us calculate the numbers/angles for better precision and further confirmation.  
This is a custom MT4 indicator: [MAAngle.mq4](http://forex-strategies-revealed.com/files/MT4/MAAngle.mq4)

Follow-up  
It calculates the angle of the Moving average (MA) at any moment and displays it as a histogram. When MA goes completely flat – the indicator is yellow, other times it'll show whether MA is rising or falling and how fast it does so.  
  
But that’s not all. You can change indicator settings, especially Angle Threshold to make histogram more (or less) sensitive to angle changes.

Range Bound or Trend?  
  
Maybe the following concept could also help to judge about presence/absence of a trend.  
  
Abstract  
I just want to share how to detect Range or Trending Market, but unfortunately this  
technique I just try & apply only in EUR/USD at H1 TimeFrame; please feel free to tweak.  
  
Here's The Deal:  
At EUR/USD Timeframe H1; try to put this 2 Indicators : ATR(14) & Standard Deviation(14)  
Now here's the rules ...  
  
If you find ATR(14) > then the Standar Deviation(14) it means EUR/USD = Ranging/Sideways.  
If you find ATR(14) < then the Standar Deviation(14) it means EUR/USD = Trending.  
  
The Logic behinds is; if the SD is smaller then the ATR it means Market in range of the 14 bars because ATR is meassure the range (high to low) of the N bars (in this case 14 bars); BUT if SD is more large then the ATR it means Market break the boundries of High to Low 14 Bars Range  
& the result Market is Trending.

Trend or Range-Bound?  
  
I personally like simple things like EMA5 & EMA13 to focus of a Trend or a Range. It's simple, fast and easy to scroll it over all time frames and don't need much processor power.  
  
Like every indicator, a moving average indicator is used to help us forecast future prices. By looking at the slope of the moving average, you can better determine the potential direction of market prices. 

Read more: [http://www.babypips.com/school/silky...#ixzz1lS33DoB3](http://www.babypips.com/school/silky-smooth-moving-averages.html#ixzz1lS33DoB3)  
  
One sweet way to use moving averages is to help you determine the trend.   
The simplest way is to just plot a single moving average on the chart. When price action tends to stay above the moving average, it would signal that price is in a general uptrend.   
If price action tends to stay below the moving average, then it would indicate that it is in a downtrend.  

Read more: [http://www.babypips.com/school/using...#ixzz1lS3U5NFd](http://www.babypips.com/school/using-moving-averages.html#ixzz1lS3U5NFd)  
  
What some traders do - and what we suggest you do as well - is that they plot a couple of moving averages on their charts instead of just one. This gives them a clearer signal of whether the pair is trending up or down depending on the order of the moving averages. Let us explain.   
In an uptrend, the "faster" moving average should be above the "slower" moving average and for a downtrend, vice versa.  
Read more: [http://www.babypips.com/school/using...#ixzz1lS3skW8z](http://www.babypips.com/school/using-moving-averages.html#ixzz1lS3skW8z)  
  
For example, let's say we have two MAs: the 5-period EMA and the 13-period EMA. On your chart, it would look like in the screen shot below. Below is a daily chart of H1 EURUSD. Throughout the uptrend, the 5 EMA is above the 13 EMA. As you can see, you can use moving averages to help show whether a pair is trending up or down. Combining this with your knowledge on trend lines, this can help you decide whether to go long or short a currency. You can also try putting more than two moving averages on your chart. Just as long as lines are in order (fastest to slowest in an uptrend, slowest to fastest in an downtrend), then you can tell whether the pair is in an uptrend or in a downtrend.   
  

Bollinger Band  

You can put in BB 2/20 and/or BB 3/20 if you like. Moreover, this could help often the turning points of the ups and downs in a sideway movement.

EURUSD, H1, 2012 February 04  
  
Simple Trading with different Entry Points (STEP)  
  
Trading in a Sideway Range could be so easy, when trading with several 1/10 orders. Collateral inputs could be done at different entry points with the benefit of choosing some various exit points as well.  
See the example below, please.  
  
Preferred Trades:  
Enter Short: A (CCI-Divergence), B (BB20/3 Intersection), C (mBB Intersection)  
Enter Long: D (CCI-Divergence), E (mBB Intersection), F (BB20/3 Intersection)  
  
Hands-on:  
Short Entry:  
Point B > Draw a vertical Line from B/BB (the upper Line of BB(20/3)) to the right and wait when the upward moving price changes down. Take the Entry then (here B).  
  
Long Entry:  
Point F > Draw a vertical Line from F/BB (the lower Line of BB(20/3)) dexterwise and take the Entry Long (F) when the downwards moving market price will moving up.  
  
Label:   
mBB = middle Line of Bollinger Band (SMA20)  
BB20/2 = Bollinger Band with Standard Deviation 2  
BB20/3 = Bollinger Band with Standard Deviation 3

Ranging or trending conditions can be found in just about any time-frame market whether you're looking at yearly, monthly, daily, or even minute charts.

A trending market is not absent fluctuations in price. In fact, it may even have small reversals. It will, however, correct its course and continue in its original upward or downward direction. That is, of course, until that trend is over.

When a market is 'Ranging,' it is simply moving up and down within support and resistance levels without moving above the highs or below the lows.

How much the price can move within a 'range' depends on differing factors If, however, the range of price fluctuation is very minor, most traders would consider that to be 'chop' where the market is just moving sideways with very little activity upwards or downwards. Some professional traders will take advantage of a ranging market, buying or selling again and again during these support and resistance patterns.

Range or Trend?...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f923.png?v=15.1)  
When you read unrealistic statements like #[**1542**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5356202#post5356202), #[**1543**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5356204#post5356204), #[**1545**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5356206#post5356206), #[**1546**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5356211#post5356211) above, it didn't really help you in your active trading time when you've coming to a decision!,... and this here #[**1546**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5356211#post5356211) is truly a tautology. Nobody knows beforehand how long will run a trend, when and how strong could be a retracement, or how much longer would withstand a Range. You couldn't copy a regression analysis unfiltered in the future. It's fuzzy logic! Trend and Range Movements you could only pin down in hindsight. Be careful, friends!

It's better to break away from this obsolete, outdated concept about Range Bound or Trending Market Rot! You can't never detected up front. I've learned more to think in terms of probabilities when I'm making market decisions. When a market seems more in a favor to consolidate then you could have seen a range retrospectively.

Profiting from Gap Trading  
Gap trading is not a new strategy. It's been used in all investment markets for a very long time. To learn this Forex trading technique is relatively easy. Gap trading in an attempt to take advantage of the difference, or "gap," in price between the close of the previous day with the open of the following day. If the open is above the previous day's close, this is commonly referred to as "gapping up." If the open is below the previous day's close, this is called "gapping down." If the open is at the exact same price, then there was no gap.  
  
I trade the risk over the week-end sometimes, when I could see a probability of making a profit.

**[Forex Gap Trading: Simple and Profitable](http://articles.submityourarticle.com/Andrew-Daigle-1519/currency-trading-strategies-44871.php)**  
  
By [Andrew Daig](http://articles.submityourarticle.com/Andrew-Daigle-1519)  
  
You can search the Internet, or go to your local library, and find a plethora of information on complicated, hard to understand, currency trading strategies. Though Forex education is important, there are many simple, time-tested Forex trading strategies that can be used immediately and give you profitable results. Profits are, as we all know, the bottom line.  
  
Profiting from Gap Trading  
  
Gap trading is not a new strategy. It's been used in all investment markets for a very long time. To learn this Forex trading technique is relatively easy. Gap trading in an attempt to take advantage of the difference, or "gap," in price between the close of the previous day with the open of the following day. If the open is above the previous day's close, this is commonly referred to as "gapping up." If the open is below the previous day's close, this is called "gapping down." If the open is at the exact same price, then there was no gap.  
  
Forex Trading and Gaps  
  
Generally, in Forex trading this strategy tends to be ignored; most people feel that as currencies are trading 24 hours a day worldwide, there is no true opening or closing prices. That being said, some people maintain that gap trading in Forex trading can be successful 85% of the time. If this is the case, there is money to be made. The question becomes: "How can you trade gaps on the Forex market?"  
  
If you ignore the 24-hour time frame associated with Forex trading, and set up an opening and closing time to create an artificial market, you can provide yourself with an open high low close data range. Based on that data range, you would be able to trade gaps. An alternative Forex trading strategy is basically to ignore trading on Saturday and Sunday, when volume thin as most of the world is not working. Under this scenario, you establish a closing time on Friday and an opening time on Monday. Based on the gap, you take the appropriate position.  
  
Unlike what you might think, the Forex trading strategy for gaps is contrarian by nature. That is to say, you do the opposite of what's intuitive. If the price gaps up, you sell. If the price gaps down, you buy.  
  
This currency trading strategy works an outstanding amount of the time, and thus, it's a simple process that can produce great profits.

When trading Gaps don't complicate things with a couple of questions like:  
  
HOW DO YOU TRADE THE GAPS ? WHERE DO YOU SET YOUR STOP? WHERE DO YOU SET YOUR TP AND TAKE PROFIT? HOW DO YOU KNOW WHICH GAPS TO TRADE AND WHICH GAPS NOT TO TRADE? HOW AND WHEN DO YOU TAKE PROFIT ON A GAP THAT DOES NOT FULLY CLOSE BEFORE PRICE MOVES AGAINST YOU?****WHAT IS THE BEST TIME FRAME TO TRADE THE GAPS?****  
  
Monitoring the charts and break down the chart patterns of a gap at different time frames.

What Causes Gaps   
PIPSMAXIMUS THEORY ON WHAT CAUSES THE GAPS IN FOREX   
  
With much research, thought and careful deliberation I have come up with a theory, as to the cause of Gaps, that occur after the Forex Market closes on Friday 4 pm EST. and when Forex Market opens at 5 pm EST. Sunday.  
  
After many a sleepless night It finally came to me one night in the wee hours of the morning like a light bulb going off in my head. And I thank Bob Iaccino of [www.traderoutlook.com](http://www.traderoutlook.com/) My teacher, mentor, friend and confidant. for the final piece of the puzzle.   
Hours of research and calls to numerous brokers asking questions to try and find reasons / cause for the gaps in Forex currency pairs, all I found were opinions, lots of opinions. Most everyone and internet sources said it is news that causes the gaps. However, there were many situations I have observed where significant gaps occurred and there was no news to cause these gaps. Some even said gaps did not exist there was no such thing as gaps ha ha. Then please someone explain to me- PipsMaximus, why a currency pair like EURUSD closes on Friday at 1.44551 and opens on Sunday/Monday at 1. 44963 - - - 41 pip gap.  
  
Most opinions were that the gaps were caused by weekend news/fundamentals. Some opinions were that back door institutional, political dealing and putting green deals Banks trading over the weekend can cause gaps (Which of course no one of influence in the financial / political community will admit too) . While I do believe the back door, institutional, political and putting green deals and Banks trading over the weekend do occur and may help to create gaps, it is not significant enough to create large gaps in Forex currency pairs. The news/fundamentals over the weekend affect [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") at market open more than anything else.   
  
We have all seen increased spreads by our brokers at market open, some brokers who sell themselves as low spread brokers refuse to, or excuse me, forget to open on time, due to the increased spreads caused by news/fundamentals over the weekend, because it is bad PR for their low spread sales pitch.  
Gaps, being caused by news and banks trading over the weekend seem to be the most widely held belief for the cause of gaps. I believe this is an incorrect explanation as to the cause of gaps. The news over the weekend and bank trading over the weekend is not the cause of gaps.   
  
The cause of gaps is trader’s reaction to the news resulting in sudden volatile price action due to traders reacting to the news. Gaps are caused by traders exiting trades en masse read further for examples and a detailed explanation.  
I know this sounds somewhat convoluted, some will say PipsMaximus you just said that news causes gaps. No, I said the news causes traders to react and the results of trader reaction cause gaps.  
  
I have never seen “THE NEWS” open or close a trade, nor have I ever heard of any trader by the name of “THE NEWS”. However, there are millions of traders by the name of Bill, Jack, Jill etc who open or close trades based on the news. So it is not the “News” that causes gaps, but rather rapid mass traders, reacting and exiting their long or short trades due to their reaction to the news. Millions of traders are regularly and unpredictably reacting to the news.  
  
I have observed times when there is “News” yet there are still small and few gaps. If news causes gaps then why is this so?  
Bob Iaccino of [www.traderoutlook.com](http://www.traderoutlook.com/) taught me a great analogy. The financial market is a car, news is the engine that powers the car, and traders are the driver of the car. The trader/driver decides to press the accelerator pedal or brake pedal and steer the car. The news/ engine cannot move the car unless the trader /driver takes action by accelerating steering and sometimes slamming on the brakes. Which many traders do based on news. Multiply this by millions of drivers and you have traffic, maybe gridlock, backups, 4 way stops, intersections with red and green lights, open desert highways full speed ahead, winding mountain or coastal roads. You name it.  
But what about when there is no major news yet there are significant gaps in numerous currency pairs when the Forex market opens? Also why when there are no black swan events, major news, political, economic or natural crises that occur and there are still significant gaps When the Market opens.   
  
I literally agonized over that question for almost a year. I also observed that after NFP, Non Farm Payroll report that is released after the first Friday of every month in the #1 economy of the world, there were smaller, and fewer gaps, Also, June through August there were fewer and smaller gaps. Why why why?  
  
So I thought a lot about NFP and what is happening there, many traders are exiting trades in the few days before NFP is released in fear that NFP may wipe out their profitable trade and reverse them to a loss so they take their money off the table, I have done this myself more than once.  
  
Then I flashed on the extremely large gaps when the Forex market opened on May 9/10 2010 after the P&G Proctor & Gamble Black Swan Event (fat finger trade) On May 6th 2010 a trader who was supposed to put on a Multi Million $ trade and instead put on a Multi Billion $ trade by tapping the B- key instead of the M- key, (fat finger). Causing a major upheaval in the Financial Markets. This also resulted in incredibly large gaps in numerous currency pairs.  
  
See last page of this report for Wikipedia definition of Black Swan event.  
When the Market opened on Sunday/Monday May 9/10 - 2010 more than 20 Forex currency pairs had larger than usual gaps. Below I have listed 8 pairs with exceptionally large gaps when the market opened resulting from the P&G fat finger trade,  
I, PipsMaximus banked a fair amount of pips trading these gaps.   
  
EURUSD 186 Pip Gap - EURJPY 307 Pip Gap - AUDJPY 230 Pip Gap - GBPJPY 211 Pip Gap  
AUDUSD 148 Pip Gap - CHFJPY 154 Pip Gap - USDJPY 104 Pip Gap - USDCAD 94 Pip Gap  
  
Bank trading over the weekend did not cause these gaps. This was not a news related event; there was no major news prior to this Black Swan event. It was a sudden unpredictable occurrence causing enormous price moves, causing traders to react. Millions of traders exited their trades to protect their accounts, not knowing what the heck was happening, (Myself, PipsMaximus included.)  
But why did this Black Swan Event cause such large gaps when the market opened ? No prior new release. Bank trading over the weekend? I don’t think so. And whenever there is a major crisis economically, like the Greece financial crises, or political crises or natural crises like the recent earthquake in Japan. Why are there large gaps in numerous currency pairs?   
Also why, when there are no black swan events, major news, political, economic or natural crises that occur and yet there are still significant gaps When the Market opens?   
  
So what is it that really happens, that creates the gaps from market close to market open ?  
What is the link, what is the correlation to Black Swan events, political economic and natural crises and sudden news release or a regularly scheduled economic report like NFP ?? Or more confusing when none of the above have occurred. YET THERE ARE GAPS when the market opens.  
  
Bob Iaccino of [www.traderoutlook.com](http://www.traderoutlook.com/) taught me this - “Sudden Bull Moves” - a sudden reversal in the current Bear price action, are caused by traders that have been short/sold and are exiting trades taking profits, or for whatever reason. Result is a sudden bull move.  
“Sudden Bear Moves” - a sudden reversal in the current Bull price action, are caused by traders there are exiting their long/buy trades and taking profit. or for whatever reason.” The result is a sudden bear move.  
Gaps in Forex currency pairs are a result of pure trader action, many many, traders exiting long and short trades for whatever reason totally unexplainable. Unless you were able to interview every trader in the world, that exited a long or short position shortly before market close. Then come up with some sort of consensus, as to why the majority of traders who were long and the majority of traders who were short exited their trade. An impossible task I believe.  
  
When a Black Swan event occurs like the P&G fiasco, millions of traders closed their positions, (Including PipsMaximus) because of the volatile price action not knowing what was happening or why and wanted to preserve their profit or minimize their loss.   
During political economic and natural crises traders are exiting trades en masse, long and short trades faster than the market makers/ Institutions /banks and brokers computers / servers can keep up with.   
This happens so fast that the Brokers/ Banks servers cannot keep up. Gaps are created in Forex currency pairs, from market close to Market open, when over the weekend the computers and servers update all the data. Some would argue that computers can process information in nano seconds, but computers/servers do get overloaded and result in slowdowns.   
Have you ever tried to exit or enter a trade during volatile fast moves only to receive a popup message - server busy, broker busy, 501 error, requote, off quote, unable to process order.   
  
So what causes gaps in Forex currency pairs when there are no Black Swan events, major news, or economic, political or natural crises?  
Every week minutes maybe seconds before the market closes thousands maybe, millions of traders close their positions weather long or short within a minute of Market close on Friday, taking profit, I have done this many times. Maybe they want to be flat for the weekend maybe they know of a news release that is due to come out over the weekend or on Monday.   
For whatever reason, many traders are exiting their trades right before the market closes on Friday. This fast and regular occurrence happens every week and if there are enough traders exiting say EURUSD faster than the servers can keep up, the end result is a Gap in Forex currency pair when the market reopens.  
  
Ok, why then are there fewer and smaller gaps after NFP ? - Because many traders are closing out their positions the few days prior to NFP. They fear the NFP report will stop them out, or wipe out the profit they have gained. So by Friday close the market has settled. The servers have time to process the data and when the market reopens there are not many large fluctuations.  
And why fewer, smaller gaps, if any gaps at all, mid June - August ?? Because there are much fewer, especially institutional traders involved in the market to create the liquidity and volatility that exists September through May.  
If all of the above is not enough circumstantial evidence to prove my case than consider this  
On April 10th 2011 - I had 4 accounts running, all with my very cool and trusted PipsMaximus Gap indicator on the charts.   
  
With the currency pair - GBPCHF the following occurred.  
Friday close April -7 – 2011 Sunday /Monday open April 9/10 - 2011  
  
FXDD - Close 1.4877 - Open 1.4845 Gap 32 pips - signal buy  
FXJE - Close 1.4877 - Open 1.4845 Gap 32 pips - signal buy  
[FXCM](/brokers/fxcm "View FXCM Broker Profile") \- Close 1.4877 - Open 1.4863 Gap 14 pips - signal buy  
MBT - close 1.4839 - Open 1.4869 Gap 30 pips - signal sell  
  
I, PipsMaximus, traded FXDD and FXCM live and traded FXJE and MBT on demo - All four GBPCHF trades hit their target including MBT how could that happen if “News” or banks trading over the weekend was the reason for causing gaps.   
In the case of MBT, traders who trade with MBT, exited trades on Friday close, resulting in a price action opposite of the other three brokers  
  
Bull Gaps are caused by traders that have been short/sold and are exiting trades en masse, in a very short period of time, for whatever reason. Causing a “Sudden Bull Move”   
Bear gaps are caused by traders there are exiting their long/buy trades en masse, in a very short period of time, for whatever reason. Causing a “Sudden Bear Move”  
This is happening faster than computers and servers can keep up, so when the data is finally updated there are gaps in numerous Forex currency pairs.  
  
So with GBPCHF shortly before Market close on Friday - -- FXDD, FXJE and FXCM, had traders exiting long trades en masse in a very short period of time creating a bear gap. While MBT had traders exiting short trades En Masse in a very short period of time creating a bull gap.  
I studied FXDD chart and MBT chart several times trying to see the difference. Only, when I printed the two charts and turned MBT chart upside down and put it next to FXDD chart, then I saw it. Literally blew me away !!!  
I believe that the larger your broker is and the larger number of trading accounts your broker services the more likely you will see gaps when the Forex market opens.  
  
Bottom line is: Traders exiting trades en masse for whatever reason and the resulting price action cause gaps not the news.  
AS LONG AS THERE ARE TRADERS TRADING AND EXITING THEIR LONG OR SHORT TRADES EN MASSE IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME JUST BEFORE THE MARKET CLOSES THERE WILL BE GAPS. AS LONG AS THERE ARE GAPS  
I, PIPSMAXIMUS WILL BE TRADING THEM!!!  
  
My apologies for the length of this report and for being repetitious at times. I could have just said “It is traders exiting trades en masse in a very short period of time that causes gaps, just take my word for it”. However, I felt the need to fully explain and provide circumstantial evidence backing up my theory. I could add another 10 pages of examples and evidence but I am sure by now you get the point. There will still be people that say, no PipsMaximus you are wrong, it is all about the news. To that I say, you can lead a horse to water but you can’t force it to drink.  
  
There it is, my theory on Gaps in Forex, if anyone has a better explanation I am all ears.

Black swan theory  
  
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia  
A black swan, a member of the species Cygnus atratus, which remained undocumented until the eighteenth century  
The Black Swan Theory or Theory of Black Swan Events is a metaphor that encapsulates the concept that The event is a surprise (to the observer) and has a major impact. After the fact, the event is rationalized by hindsight.The theory was developed by Nassim Nicholas Taleb to explain:The disproportionate role of high-impact, hard to predict, and rare events that are beyond the realm of normal expectations in history, science, finance and technology The non-computability of the probability of the consequential rare events using scientific methods (owing to the very nature of small probabilities) The psychological biases that make people individually and collectively blind to uncertainty and unaware of the massive role of the rare event in historical affairs Unlike the earlier philosophical "black swan problem", the "Black Swan Theory" (capitalized) refers only to unexpected events of large magnitude and consequence and their dominant role in history. Such events, considered extreme outliers, collectively play vastly larger roles than regular occurrences.[1]

Forex Gap Strategy **  
  
Forex Gap Strategy** — is an interesting trading system that utilizes one of the most disturbing phenomena of the Forex market — a weekly gap between the last Friday's close price and the current Monday's open price. The gap itself takes its origin in the fact that the interbank currency market continues to react on the fundamental news during the weekend, opening on Monday at the level with the most liquidity. The offered strategy is based on the assumption that the gap is a result of speculations and the excess volatility, thus a position in the opposite direction should probably become profitable after a few days.  
**Features**  

  1. Regular trading with clear rules.
  2. No stop-loss hunting or premature hits.
  3. Statistically proven profit.
  4. You have to open position at the week's beginning and close it right before the end.

**How to Trade?**  

  1. Select a currency pair with a relatively high level of volatility. I recommend GBP/JPY as it showed the best results during my tests. But other JPY-based pairs should work too. By the way, it's a good strategy to use on all major currency pairs at the same time.
  2. When a new week starts look if there is a gap. A gap should be at least 5 times the average spread for the pair. Otherwise it can't be considered a real signal.
  3. If Monday's (or late Sunday's if you trade from North or South America) open is below the Friday's (or early Saturday if you trade from Oceania or Eastern Asia) close the gap is negative and you should open a Long position.
  4. If Monday's open is above the Friday's close the gap is positive and you should open a Short position.
  5. Don't set a stop-loss or a take-profit level (it's a rare occasion but stop-loss isn't recommended in this strategy).
  6. Right before the end of the weekly trading session (e.g., 5 minutes before the end) you need to close the position.

**Example**  
  
[http://www.earnforex.com/forex-strat...tegy-chart.png](http://www.earnforex.com/forex-strategy/forex-gap-strategy-chart.png)  
  
You can see GBP/JPY pair's last 7 weeks (as of May 24, 2010) and all of them have gaps. 6 out of 7 gaps give correct signals that result in a lot of profit. The last gap gives a wrong signal and yields a medium loss. The average spread for GBP/JPY was 3 pips during the example period and all gaps were much wider than 15 pips, making them all qualifying signals. The net total profit was 1,612 pips in 7 weeks — not that bad.

Forex Trading: Trading the weekend gap  
by ForexTrading-Pips on January 23, 2012  
  
Forex Trading: Euro currency gapped lower at the open of this weeks trade following the failure of European banking and government officials to reach an agreement over the weekend.  
Weekend gaps present decent trade setups for short term traders as the gap is typically filled within 24-48 hours. Take a look at the 5 minute chart of Euro currency below. Note the 50 pip gap down on this weeks ‘open’ which is then filled within the following 12 hours. Nimble traders are fading these gap moves with reasonably high winning percentages.

Forex Trading Euro weekend gap  
  
It is important to use wide stop loss orders when trading gaps as there can be significant negative excursion before the gap closes, and indeed not all gaps are filled. It is also important to pay attention to spreads which can be wide during the Sunday evening opening. Only the most liquid currencies should be considered when trading weekend gaps: EUR, GBP and JPY.

[Breakaway Gap Forex Pattern](http://www.forexsure.net/products/31-forex-basics/326-breakaway-gap-forex-pattern.html)  
  
Breakaway gap formations occur at the beginning of a new trend, usually at the end of long consolidation periods. They may also appear after the completion of some chart formations that tend to act as short-term consolidations. Breakaway gaps signify a brisk change in trading sentiment, and they occur on increasingly heavy trading.   
Traders are understandably frustrated by consolidations, which are rarely profitable. Therefore, a breakout from the slow lane is embraced with optimism by the profit-hungry traders.   
The price takes a secondary place to participation. As always, naysayers follow the initial breakout. Sooner rather than later, the pessimists have no choice but to join the new move, thus creating more volume.   
Breakaway gaps are not likely to be filled during the breakout and for the duration of the subsequent move. In time, they may be filled duringa new move on the opposite side.  
In Figure below, the currency futures trades sideways in a 100-pip range between 0.6550 and 0.6690 for a period of time. A price gap between 0.6690 and 0.6730 signals the breakaway from the range.  
Finally, the breakaway gap provides only the price direction. There is no a price objective. However, an increasing demand for a currency ensures a solid move on good volume in the foreseeable future.

No, Forexcube, absolutely not.  
  
My cycles are extracted using an algorithm used by telephone companies to digitize/deconstruct voice data, called the Goertzel algorithm.  
  
I use CCI divergences in my trendlines and confirmation in cycle turns.  
  
I was referring in general to the way divergences are viewed by the author of the article.  
He explained something about stochastic divergences that also apply to CCI divergences.

CCI-Bottom, Market Price has touched the lower Line of the Bollinger Band (20/2) an Fisher's Histogram (red balk) could change in a green one now; -DI Top. Time to change in the counterpart direction (DS1 1.3079/DPV 1.3050)? We'll see!

It seems I begun to catch something. I made a som buy entries from 1.3042 and some new one above. My TP is 1.313.  
  
Dear FC, do you think that this TP makes some sense?

Hidden Divergence Divergences not only signal a potential trend reversal; they can also be used as a possible sign for a trend continuation. Always remember, the [trend](http://www.babypips.com/school/what-is-a-trending-market.html) is your friend, so whenever you can get a signal that the trend will continue, then good for you!   
Hidden bullish divergence happens when price is making a higher low (HL), but the oscillator is showing a lower low (LL).   
This can be seen when the pair is in an uptrend. Once price makes a higher low, look and see if the oscillator does the same. If it doesn't and makes a lower low, then we've got some hidden divergence in our hands.

Lastly, we've got hidden bearish divergence. This occurs when price makes a lower high (LH), but the oscillator is making a higher high (HH). By now you've probably guessed that this occurs in a downtrend. When you see hidden bearish divergence, chances are that the pair will continue to shoot lower and continue the downtrend.

Let's recap what you've learned so far about hidden divergence.   
If you're a trend follower, then you should dedicate some time to spot some hidden divergence.   
If you do happen to spot it, it can help you jump in the trend early.   
Sounds good, yes?

**How To Trade Divergences**  
  
Now it's time to put those Jedi-divergence mind tricks to work and force the markets to give you some pips!   
Here we'll show you some examples of when there was divergence between price and [oscillator](http://www.babypips.com/school/leading-indicators-oscillators.html) movements.   
First up, let's take a look at regular divergence. Below is a daily chart of USD/CHF.  
  
[](http://www.babypips.com/school/images/grade11/regular-bullish-divergence2.png)[http://babypips.cachefly.net/school/...divergence.png](http://babypips.cachefly.net/school/images/grade11/regular-bullish-divergence.png)  
  
We can see from the falling [trend line](http://www.babypips.com/school/trend-lines.html) that USD/CHF has been in a downtrend. However, there are signs that the downtrend will be coming to an end.   
While price has registered lower lows, the [stochastic](http://www.babypips.com/school/stochastic.html) (our indicator of choice) is showing a higher low.   
Something smells fishy here. Is the [reversal](http://www.babypips.com/school/identifying-reversals.html) coming to an end? Is it time to buy this sucker?  
  
[](http://www.babypips.com/school/images/grade11/regular-bullish-divergence-end2.png)[http://babypips.cachefly.net/school/...gence-end1.png](http://babypips.cachefly.net/school/images/grade11/regular-bullish-divergence-end1.png)  
  
If you had answered yes to that last question, then you would have found yourself in the middle of the Caribbean, soaking up margaritas, as you would have been knee deep in your pip winnings!   
It turns out that the divergence between the stochastic and price action was a good signal to buy. Price broke through the falling trend line and formed a new uptrend. If you had bought near the bottom, you could have made more than a thousand pips, as the pair continued to shoot even higher in the following months.   
Now can you see why it rocks to get in on the trend early?!  
Before we move on, did you notice the tweezer bottoms that formed on the second low?   
Keep an eye out for other clues that a reversal is in place. This will give you more confirmation that a trend is coming to an end, giving you even more reason to believe in the power of divergences!

follow-up:  
  
Next, let's take a look at an example of some hidden divergence. Once again, let's hop on to the daily chart of USD/CHF.  
  
[](http://www.babypips.com/school/images/grade11/hidden-bearish-divergence2.png)[http://babypips.cachefly.net/school/...ivergence1.png](http://babypips.cachefly.net/school/images/grade11/hidden-bearish-divergence1.png)  
  
Here we see that the pair has been in a downtrend. Notice how price has formed a lower high but the stochastic is printing higher highs.   
According to our notes, this is hidden bearish divergence! Hmmm, what should we do? Time to get back in the trend?   
Well, if you ain't sure, you can sit back and watch on the sidelines first.   
  
[](http://www.babypips.com/school/images/grade11/hidden-bearish-divergence-end2.png)[http://babypips.cachefly.net/school/...rgence-end.png](http://babypips.cachefly.net/school/images/grade11/hidden-bearish-divergence-end.png)  
  
If you decided to sit that one out, you might be as bald as Professor Xavier because you pulled out all your hair.   
Why?   
Well the trend continued!   
Price bounced from the trend line and eventually dropped almost 2000 pips!   
Imagine if you had spotted the divergence and seen that as a potential signal for a continuation of the trend?   
Not only would you be sipping those margaritas in the Caribbean, you'd have your own pimpin' yacht to boot!

I'm still learning how to pick my cycles, because they are not based on the largest amplitude cycles, which have been the way things have been done in the past. The largest amplitude cycles will re-paint and shift quite often, which has put a lot of people off to cycles. I'm testing for "fitness" of a cycle, not if it has the largest amplitude. There can be literally dozens of cycles in 500 bars of price data. Which one to choose? My testing shows, its not necessarily the largest amplitude.  
  
Here is the (5min) cycle summary for this morning 8:30am EST, for EURUSD.  
  
A nice CCI divergence right on the Weekly S1. Cycles are turning up... perfect.  
  
The 27 bar cycle was a 100% winner, and the top set was the largest pip producing cycles.  
So, I should get out near the vertical (red) line. Its the top of 2 of the 3 cycles.  
There is a bearish hidden divergence forming. So, watch out.

Total for the month = +562 pips  
  
I really trade as aimple as I can...a mix of multiple time frame analysis together with divergence and CCI tops/bottoms.

altoronto, I wish I knew. I still need a lot of testing. I believe news will play into the 5-min timeframe immensely. Its like dropping a pebble into a pond... new waves will create a new landscape of waves, that affect current waves.  
  
These current cycles on the 5min seem to be slipping currently. I have a short take profit on this current one. But they have been pretty good this AM.  
  
The top was missed on this short, so there was a bit of drawdown, but hey, that is quite all right.

Hi Carl  
  
Is your cycle27 something like a smoothed CCI(14)?  
Looks great!  
If so then the "CCI(14)-Tops-&-Bottom-Trading" could be identified with your "Cycle27-Trading".  
Could you compare this analogy with higher time frames, please?  
Kindest regards  
FXcube

FXcube,  
The 27-bar cycle was extracted from price data starting Sunday night. It was 100% profitable to the the high/low. So, yes it looks great. But, I need CCI to confirm that these cycles are indeed good, because we don't know how long these cycles last.  
  
Currently it looks like the 27-bar cycle is inverting.  
  
Much more testing is required. But, I am enjoying real-trading while I'm testing.  
  
Carl  
  
PS. I'll show longer term cycles next.

> I'm still learning how to pick my cycles, because they are not based on the largest amplitude cycles, which have been the way things have been done in the past. The largest amplitude cycles will re-paint and shift quite often, which has put a lot of people off to cycles. I'm testing for "fitness" of a cycle, not if it has the largest amplitude. There can be literally dozens of cycles in 500 bars of price data. Which one to choose? My testing shows, its not necessarily the largest amplitude.

MTFA  
Monthly and Weekly charts will go up, in contrast the daily down.   
That could be a reason for abrupt price movements today and in the next days.  
So I like to trade more the lower time frames (M1/M5).  
...and will wait for higher probabilty-profit-entry-patterns.  
  
Next excellent scalping area could be around 1.3142 DPV just now.

Maybe you'll find a lot of Divergence EA's in the internet when googling.  
I have test some Divergence-EAs in the past years, none of them could hold one's promise.  
The problem is that you have to make a MTFA before. If not you could loose all your money.  
Kindest regards

I searched the thread and couldn't find an answer:  
  
I use crodzilla divergence master latest version, but I do not get bear-3, bull-4 etc... signals. The table just shows : DATA   
  
Is there any solution to that?

Edit: I guess it is because of [forex.com](/brokers/forexcom "View FOREX.com Broker Profile"), I've just tried running the indicator on AAAfx and it wors fine.

Loss Order Management (LOM)  
Loss Order Management has a dynamical aspect.  
Compare: #[**1583**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5358856#post5358856), #[**1612**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5359984#post5359984) and #[**1614**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5360469#post5360469).  
Floating P/L., Closed Trades P/L and Equity.  
  
  
All History:  
Equity: 128'317.73$  
All open Orders: 1'814.-$  
  
  
Compute LOM   
Target 1% per Day (500,.-$)  
500.-$ x 5 Trading Days = 2'500.-$  
LOM = Equity - Deposit - Days of Opened Account x Target per Day  
128'317.73$ - 50'000.-$ -2'500.-$ = 75'817.73$  
  
LOM should be calculated exclusively with the "TOTAL-PROFIT" (Equity - Deposit)  
128'317.73$ (Equity) - 50'000.-$ (Deposit) - 2'500.-$ (500.- per Day; Account Duration; Profit Target per Day) = 75'817.73$  
  
This is the excess profit when trading without Stop loss the most if the time. It can be done when the Multiple Time Frame Analysis (MTFA) is done in a correct way.  
Kindest regards

All timeframes are good enough for me. Under the actual EURUSD market environment I preferre to trade the EURUSD currency-pair with lower time frames currently.

Do you like to act foolishly?  
Sorry, ...but I'm sure you'll find it out by yourself.  
Does that matter for you! Focus at the CCI-concept, that's evident here at this thread...not these oil-mist-cooled accounts.  
Maybe you could brace up mañana and read this thread. I don't know!

EURUSD, M5, 2012 February 07  
  
Short @ 1.3170  
  
...and make many Scalping Trades there additively (see #[**1624**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5362457#post5362457)).  
  
I tend to go extremly fast in and out of the market with my market orders concerning the repeatedly changements in direction around a Pivotal which might often occurs (see Path1/Path2), see below the right chart EURUSD, M1, 2012 February 07.  
  
So I didn't somtimes wait till the price has reached the next CCI-Bottom (Exit B) at M1, I go out with a part of these orders, when CCI is crossing the Zero-Line (Exit A).

I'm pretty busy today, but near a computer.  
  
Here is that 5min from this morning.  
I made a long trade at just above the daily pivot based on these 100% cycles (300 bars) and CCI divergence. I had to close it early, but a profit is a profit.  
  
This short looks good from a CCI divergence point of view and the peaking of the 100% cycles.  
  
I have a stop above the top for safety. I'll let this run through to cycle turn.

Oh yes. The problem is that other traders make a link at a signal service and will sell my ideas. I've known it to happen. Other knuckleheads (business men) have visit me at home and have fiddled at my computer. They didn't know, that it was the wrong PC and the wrong office.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f923.png?v=15.1)

Forex Market Hours   
The international nature of currency trading allows for around the clock trading. This means that is it possible for the Forex markets to be traded twenty four hours a day.   
The **Forex market hours** are divided into multiple sessions throughout this period. Each session is identified by the predominant region of trading during the course of the session. Trading sessions become active as the major financial markets open and become active in each geographical region.  
The full trading day is divided into **four** key sessions; the London session, the New York session, the Pacific session and the Asian session. Each is characterized by its own unique dynamic and trading behaviour.  
When trading Forex, particularly breakout strategies, you need to be aware of the timing of each of these key sessions, their particular dynamics and the currency pairs which dominate the trading in each session.  
Understanding the timing of the **Forex hours** will help you to align your trading strategies to the times when their is the greatest potential for profit.  
  
  
[http://www.londonforexopen.com/image...rket-hours.png](http://www.londonforexopen.com/images/forex-market-hours.png)  
**  
The London Session**  
The **London session** is regarded as the key session in the trading day. It is the session where the greatest volume of transactions are made and includes not just the London, but also the opening of the European markets.With so many transactions taking place at this time liquidity in the markets is high and therefore the cost to transact during this session (spread) tends to be lower.  
The volume traded often leads to daily market trends being defined during this session and it is common for trends established at this time to carry through into the subsequent New York trading session.  
  
**The New York Session**  
The **New York session** is the second largest trading session by volume. The New York Forex session opens mid way through the London session and will often see a continuation of the market trends previously set. Trading activity commonly peaks during the start and end of this session, with a drop in trading activity half way through as traders break for lunch.  
  
**The Pacific Session**  
The **Pacific session** starts when the New Zealand and Australian markets open. It is one of the quietest sessions in terms of trading volume with the majority of trading activity focusing on the major Pacific pairs (AUD/USD, NZD/USD) and regional currency crosses.  
  
**The Asian Session**  
Trading in the **Asian session** is dominated by the Tokyo (Japan) opening. During the course of this session trading volume in European based currencies tends to drop away and focus switches to the Yen pairs, in particular the USD/JPY. This quieter trading period often means that trends in the major European currency pairs (EURUSD, GBPUSD) are put on hold until the reopening of the London markets the following morning.  
The increased volume and volatility at the opening of a market session makes these times ideal for implementing a breakout trading strategy that can capture the momentum of these early session moves.  
London Forex Open is a [Forex breakout trading strategy](http://www.londonforexopen.com/) that aims to capture both breakouts and false breakouts that occur at the start of the London Forex Market hours.

24hr Forex Trading – Forex Trading Hours  
  
Open a forex account and enjoy a 24hr Forex Trading experience. Currencies are traded 24 hours a day, from Sunday afternoon EST* (Eastern Standard Time) to Friday afternoon EST. Through this 5+ day week of market activity, there is always at least one financial center open for business. Indeed, as some markets close for the night, others open somewhere else on the planet. Since forex trading hours overlap, currencies are being traded continuously. In other words, forex practically never stops.  
  
Traders new to the world of foreign exchange tend to think that since the market is open 24 hours a day, they may trade whenever they choose during the day. Although this preconceived idea is actually true, it needs to be clarified. Indeed when it comes to forex trading hours, some hours present better opportunities than others. By better opportunities, we mean of course potentially greater profit. So what are the most suitable forex trading hours and why?   
  
Usually, the best time to enter forex markets is when large volumes of currencies are traded. At those hours, traders can take full advantage of [forex benefits](http://www.finotec.com/forex/forex-trading-benefits.php). Since the forex market is traded 24 hours a day, the best time to enter is when several countries are trading at the same time. In each time zone across the world, forex markets operate from 8 am to 4 pm. So, to take advantage of heavy trading volume, the best is to look at when forex market hours in different countries overlap. Those hours are usually the time when the forex market is the most active and has thus the largest volume of trades and the biggest pip movements. It is when currencies are the most active that traders have a better chance of making some profit. Slow markets offer little chances of profit and therefore, forex traders usually stay out of them. When do forex trading times overlap?   
  
**Worldwide Forex Trading Hours:**  
  
<http://www.finotec.com/images/mrket-hours.gif>   
  
Forex Trading opens in New Zealand, followed by Australia, Asia (and particularly Japan), the Middle East, Europe (with London being the main financial center) and America.  
  
**Forex Trading Hours (EST):**  
Australia: 5pm - 1 am   
Tokyo: 7 pm - 3 am   
Singapore/Hong Kong: 9 pm - 5 am   
Frankfurt: 2 am - 10 am   
London: 3 am - 11 am  
  
We can see that at around 5 am, trading stops in Asia while in Europe, the market is at its busiest time.  
On the other side of the Atlantic, trading in the USA kicks off in New York at 8 am while the European market is coming to a close. Afterwards, the Australian is waking up again in Sidney completing one full trading day.  
  
To see when markets overlap, let's have a look at the different forex trading times in each main financial center across the globe. (Times are displayed according to EST) So here are the times when two trading sessions overlap:   
  
New York and London: from 8 am to 12 am (EST)   
  
Sydney and Tokyo: from 7 pm to 2 am   
  
London and Tokyo markets overlap one hour, from 3 am to 4 am.   
  
What does this mean? Trading EUR/USD, GBP/USD, or USD/CHF between 8 am and 12 am (EST) can lead to good results since markets for those currencies (European and American) are both active at the same time. This is when the largest volume of trades occurs, creating a greater chance of making significant profit in the forex market.   
  
Another good time to trade is from 1 am to 3 am EST. As you can see in the table above, at that time, European markets are waking up while Asian markets are closing, offering good trade opportunities. The same goes for the 7 pm to 10 pm EST time period, when the Asian and Australian markets overlap.   
  
Also, you have probably noticed that from 4 pm to 6 pm EST, there is no interesting overlap. That’s when the US markets close without overlapping any other large market. At those hours, the volume of trades is much lower, offering less great trade opportunities.   
You can thus see that while you can take advantage of a 24hr Forex Trading experience, some hours will allow for better opportunities than others.   
  
*EST = UTC** - 5 hours   
  
**UTC= Coordinated Universal Time  
  
While some hours of the day are busier than others, meaning that forex trading activity is greater at those hours, price fluctuation varies from day to day. As a general rule, some days of the week are busier than others. Whether in London, Tokyo, or the U.S., pip range movements for all 4 majors tend to be greater towards the middle of the week. Generally speaking, it is during Tuesday and Wednesday [Forex Trading Sessions](http://www.finotec.com/forex/forex-trading-sessions.php) that we see the widest pip variation for all majors.

**The Best Times to Trade the 24-hour Forex Market**  
By [Mark Whistler](http://www.tradingmarkets.com/authors/all/Mark_Whistler) |   
  
Forex traders never sleep, or at least, it would appear that way, with markets open 24/7. With the aforementioned in mind, some may be wondering if there's another way to approach trading, or if there are simply "better" times to trade than others.   
  
Within this article, we not only examine Forex hours and when the best times to trade are, but we will also examine the overall 'paradigm' behind trader's mindset of market-hours on the whole.  
  
**I Mean Really, Who Are You?**  
First and foremost, before we jump into a discussion of Forex hours, it's important to know what type of a trader you are...Doing so will help clarify the time frames you trade. Really, there are three types of traders out there: Forex day traders, swing traders and long-term holders. Have you decided this yet?   
  
If you haven't taken a clear stance of what type of trader you are, it may be causing you to lost money...Here's why: Without knowing what timeframes you trade, without having made this decision in your mind, it may be causing emotional turmoil, unnecessary trading -- and even prompting you to trade at the wrong times.   
  
Long-term (there are very few in Forex) will most likely not be concerned about market hours, as their positions generally attempt to transcend short-term volatility.   
  
Swing won't be as concerned with short-term volatility, but for those who are attempting to hold for one, or more weeks, can perhaps use times when more than one market is open, for greater volatility entering, or exiting trades.   
Day traders, should be most concerned about market hours. As we move through the next sections of the article, day traders will want to remember two things: Liquidity provides opportunity. Brokerages want to you to trade more. (I'll explain more on this in a moment.)  
  
**Hours of Operation**  
Personally, I think it's pretty cool that Forex markets are open 24/7, the perfect scenario for those who are trying outside of normal business hours, or live in a distant time zone. However, not all markets are open at the same time -- they do overlap though, The below graph shows when the four markets: London, New York, Sydney and Tokyo are open (on a 24 hour clock, based on Eastern Standard Time)  
  
[http://images.tradingmarkets.com/200...p021208-11.gif](http://images.tradingmarkets.com/2008/HowTo/jp021208-11.gif)  
  
What you will notice in the above chart is there are three times when markets over lap...  
  
3:00 AM to 4:00 AM - London and Tokyo overlap.  
8:00 AM to 12:00 PM - London and New York are both open.  
7:00 PM to 2:00 AM - Sydney and Tokyo trade together.  
  
During times when more than one market is open, volume and volatility increase significantly, and are a great time for day traders to see action happen. However, when only market is open, trading can dry up significantly, especially late at night, via U.S. time.  
  
**There are two points to note here though:**  
1\. While trading action can be slow when only one market is open, it does not mean that movement does not occur. Many brokerage firms will tell you that it is not a good idea to trade (for daytraders) during times when only one market is open. And, it's understandable too, since they make their money when you trade heavily. When only one market is open, there's a good chance you're going to trade less. Thus, remember that while Forex firms would prefer you only trade during hours where more than one market is open, you can still make money when only one market is trading.  
  
2\. When the New York markets is open, by itself, during the day, traders will generally see more action than when Sydney, or Tokyo are open by themselves. Usually, London can be fairly slow too, from 4:00 AM until about 7:00 AM, but can see an uptick in volume even before New York opens, as U.S. traders wake up and login, pre-stock market. Though the New York market is open by itself from noon to 7:00 PM, noon to 5:00 PM can see movement, as many U.S. stock, option and commodity markets are open too.   
  
At the end of the day, Forex daytraders will likely want to be around mostly for hours when more than one market is open; however, only having one market open doesn't mean that currencies won't move -- especially in the case of New York hours.   
  
Finally, by trading in currency pairs that are related to the markets open, there could be increased volatility, as opposed to the currency pairs that are not. However, we are a globally connected currency market and if one market makes a bold move, do not, for one second think other markets will not move too.   
  
Because of the rise in Forex popularity, every market is connected like water...When a stone is cast in one market, the ripples will move through all markets.

It strikes me when I read the last three articles above (#[**1635**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5364487#post5364487), #[**1637**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5364492#post5364492), #[**1638**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5364499#post5364499)), that I could make money besides the trading hours just as well. I'm really not interested if a market is open or closed. What I have to do is to change some tactical aspects and might be have more bear with the price action when trading outside the trading hours. That's all! Still more ...it could be safer ...trading beyond the trading hours.  
Kindest regards

Sorry danc, that I have to tell you that you don't understand the "Hidden Divergence Concept" in a right way: Read it again and correct your statements, please. Maybe I should not correct shaky statements. I don't know!

I would take a look if the H4 Range will be broken (up or down). Within this range I will make M1/M5 Trades.

Scalping  
Before scalping it's better to take an overview of the market environment.  
So switch between the time frames Daily (#[**1659**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5366766#post5366766)) > H4 (#[**1659**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5366766#post5366766)) > H1 (#[**1659**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5366766#post5366766)) > M30 (#[**1660**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5366770#post5366770)) > M15 (#[**1660**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5366770#post5366770)) > M5.  
Today you could easily realize that a Range make itself at home.  
I have decide today to trade some ups and downs within the M15 Range (#[**1660**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5366770#post5366770)) at M1 (see #[**1661**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5366775#post5366775), #[**1658**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5366760#post5366760), please).  
...and waiting for an outbreak.  
Kindest regards

Loss Order Management (LOM)  
  
LOM is a really dynamical aspect and conditionaled at the risk tolerance.  
  
LOM 2012 February 08  
  
LOM seems out of reach at the beginning of a new (opened) Trading Account.  
  
How to calculate LOM, see e.g.: #[**1669**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5368052#post5368052)

Dear Forexcube  
  
Thank's a lot to show us the power of LOM , i have successfully integrate this concept into my trading plan .  
i have to admit that for TAYSAC system itself its a very demanding system , too complicate for me with the MTFA analysis..... i don't have enough brain cells to really do it right ...... but i agree with this concept.  
i agree with you in fact we have to build a system that is telling if the market is in a phase where the best bet is to "buy dips" or on the contrary "sell bounces".  
And I think that is the main question to answer if you want not only to catch a "trend" but as well to make money on what is often called "noise"...as for me you can't make enough money if you are just chasing "trends" and frankly I do not think that "trend" is an operational concept for a currency (which is not an asset).  
  
thank's again forexcube

follow-up  
  
Loss Order Management (LOM)  
  
LOM is a really dynamical aspect and conditionaled at the risk tolerance.  
  
Sample Calculation  
LOM 2012 February 08  
11'128.20$ - 200.-$ = 10'928.20$   
10'928.20$ - 10'000.-$ = 928.20$  
928.20$ > 812.80$  
LOM is in the Limit and the risk profil, too.  
  
  
11'202.08$ - 200.- = 11'002.08$  
11'002.08$ - 10'000.-$ = 1'002.08$  
1'002.08$ > 790.32$  
LOM is in the Limit and the risk profil also.

Loss Order Management (LOM)  
The target is 1% a Day, say 100.-$ at a 10'000.-$ Account.  
  
Formula A  
Equity - 1% per Day (100.-$ x x Trading Days) = LOM  
  
This should be also your Maximum Risk Capital.   
  
When 100% profit is made the Target should be (longer term) that LOM is calculaed à la formula:  
  
Formula B  
Equity - 1% per Day (100.-$ x x trading Days) **\- Deposits** = LOM  
  
In this case LOM would be calculated solely from the profit.

Loss Order Management (LOM)  
  
LOM is okay here, but what is when you aren't sitting in front of your monitor and you will let orders open?  
  
Then you have to make a probability forecast based on a multiple market analysis and take the risk over. Maybe DR3 1.3355 or more, like 1.35 before Friday NY Close could be achievable (when I come to consider it, ...crazy Friday?) even though H4 signalizes more a downside movement - in contrast hereto Weekly and Monthly candles could shape also more upside. Okay ,...I could set some Hedging Orders and will try to counterbalance all trades at a higher time frame in the future if I'm not willing to set a Stop Loss. In this case here there are 2 Lots open. The market price could go maximum 500 pips in the counterpart direction and the orders would be still in the market, never mind that LOM will be out at this level.

Hi all!  
  
Still on reinvesting and managing your money..."1%" pops up again! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
  
  
_It was once said by Albert Einstein that compounding is the most powerful force in the universe. Whether or not you subscribe to such statement, it is without debate that compounding does offer phenomenal results in the investment world. With a systematic plan, you can parlay your profits from trading in the foreign exchange (FOREX) market to a substantial fortune. Here's the plan:  
  
Get A Dependable Strategy  
  
There are many strategies available for achieving profits on a consistent basis. Of course, you will inevitably experience some losses along the way. The trick is to minimize not only the number of losses but also the amount of each loss you will suffer. Do not be sucked in by products or training programs claiming that you will be successful with every trade you make. Also, do not be dazzled by programs which offer little more than extravagant bells and whistles or those that promise overnight riches. It is not necessary to pay an arm and a leg for an effective program which provides workable strategies. In fact, some of the simplest, and consequently least expensive, strategies have generated results as impressive as those you might pay big money for.  
  
Aim For Conservative Profits  
  
The temptation to make fast money almost always leads to the sin of overtrading. Overtrading can take the form of trading when you should not be doing so or taking positions involving an unreasonable degree of risk. Avoid the temptation by remaining focused and loyal to yor long-term objective. You should also carefully observe and study the market for well-planned trades. You may choose to confine your trading to one or just a few currency pairs so that you can gain a more in-depth knowledge of the behavior of that particular niche.  
  
Once you have a sense of the pulse, you can start trading with a conservative daily goal of, let's say, 1 percent of your entire margin or balance in your account. If you can keep up that average for 20 trading days per month, then your return for that month will be at least 20 percent. Remember, in the world of FOREX, 1 percent per day is certainly achievable with the right training, discipline and strategy. In fact, many traders routinely average 3 to 5 percent per day. Obviously, the reward potential is greater when more risk is taken. But one percent is plenty enough to achieve outstanding results by year end.  
  
Reinvest for Exponential Growth  
  
When you first start, 1 percent may seem quite small both in terms of percentage as well as in absolute dollar gains. However, once you start to reinvest a significant portion of your profits, you will quickly see that 1 percent daily adds up fast. As do many traders, you may want to withdraw a small portion of your profits at regular intervals to give yourself a feeling of realized accomplishment.. But, leaving the lion's share in your account for reinvestment will be the key to your real achievement. If you would like to test this hypothesis, use different variables in your calculation of profits where you start with $1,000 as your margin. For instance, compounding $1,000 at 20 percent per month yields a total balance of approximately $9,000 over 12 months and almost $80,000 over 24 months. Of course, you have to deduct your broker's spread and Uncle Sam's cut. Still not bad though, huh?. Well, what are you waiting for? Get started today.

Loss Order Management (LOM)  
The target is 1% a Day, say 100.-$ at a 10'000.-$ Account.  
  
Formula A  
Equity - 1% per Day (100.-$ x x Trading Days) = LOM  
  
This should be also your Maximum Risk Capital.   
Actual:  
12'630.27$ - 400.-$ (4 x 100.-$) = 12'230.27$  
  
When 100% profit is made the Target should be (longer term) that LOM is calculaed à la formula:  
  
Formula B  
Equity - 1% per Day (100.-$ x x trading Days) **\- Deposits** = LOM  
  
In this case LOM would be calculated solely from the profit.  
  
Actual:  
12'630.27$ - 400.-$ (4 x 100.-$) - 10'000.-$ = 2'230.27$  
  
(See also #[**831**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5230140#post5230140)).  
  
Does that mean anything to you?

LOM  
What does that tell you?  
If I decide as an advanced level trader not trade so much with the "Stop Loss Concept" cos I feel confident that over 98% of my Loss Orders will run in the winning zone sooner or later I could run my orders in a loss over e.g.  2'230.27$ (Formula B).  
This means that 5 x 0.1 Lot Orders could run over 400 points in the loss zone and 230.27$ would be left over for LOM.  
Not bad, isn't it?  
Kindest regards

I'm not a friend of Stop Loss. It's help more the brokers profit than your assets. I like trading an active Loss Order Management (LOS), but what I have to do is to close my account when they are in a profit zone between 50-200% cos sudden, abrupt market movements could pop up several times a year and I make more money in this way as the other way around to this day.

See #[**1687**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5374678#post5374678)  
  
Oh yes, Trailing Stops could be funny! Do it!  
  
I preferre it here and there. When I make MTFA and I have set for example short at M15 and I see the market price falling more down and crosses higher time cycles (e.g. H1 and H4) I would set a trailing stop at H1 then, if the Daily looks more down, ...when ranging I would go out at a fix level (most at a pivotal).  
  
You could also set a Trailing Stop e.g. at H4 when trading Weekly down/up by trading the daily...and so on. Try it out by yourself when analyzing the market price at different time frames. Every trader has work out his concepts which fits him best.  
  
Setting a Trailing Stop depends on the strategy factor and the risk tolerance.  
  
Hedging Orders  
I hedge my orders many times and "multiply the loss of profit" until the loss order would run in the winning zone.

Hi dryclean  
I wouldn't trade H1 before Friday NY close Time and after such a price movement, maybe some scalping trades here and there at M1 Level. The EURUSD Market seems to be not in a stable condition. Remember also the Greece sovereign default nobody talks about it. Higher-Time-Frames-EURUSD-Buy-Investments seems for me too dangerous currently. Maybe you have to learn in a more qualified aspect when to use which time frame. I don't know!  
Kindest regards

**MT4 indicator (Forex_Freeway_2.mq4)**  
  
[http://forex-indicators.net/files/in...m/download.png](http://forex-indicators.net/files/indicators/mt4custom/download.png) Download indicator: [Forex_Freeway_2.mq4](http://forex-indicators.net/files/indicators/mt4custom/Forex_Freeway_2.mq4)  
  
**How to trade with Forex_Freeway indicator**  
  
[http://forex-indicators.net/files/in...m/freeway2.png](http://forex-indicators.net/files/indicators/mt4custom/freeway2.png)  
  
Forex Freeway indicator is based on CCI indicator. In fact, it analyzes multiple CCI - from several time frames. There are 4 "roads" of Forex Freeway, read from left to right - 15min, 30min, 1 hour and 4 hours.  
  
The idea is to enter the market when all 4 CCI agree on a trend.  
A trader chooses which time frames to monitor.  
  
**Trading signals are interpreted the following way:**  
When all 4 roads of the Forex Freeway are green - Buy.  
When all 4 roads of the Forex Freeway are red - Sell.  
  
**Important: when you set up the indicator**  
When adding Forex Freeway indicator to MT4 chart, be sure your chart has "Chart shift" settings on, otherwise you won't see the indicator - it will have no room to paint itself on the right.  

Once enabled, you'll find a small triangle above your screen, see example below. You can move this triangle to adjust your charts shift.

**There is another Forex_Freeway indicator:**  
[http://forex-indicators.net/files/in...m/download.png](http://forex-indicators.net/files/indicators/mt4custom/download.png) Download indicator: [Forex_Freeway.mq4](http://forex-indicators.net/files/indicators/mt4custom/Forex_Freeway.mq4)  
  
This one has additional horizontal lines across the Freeways roads, called "Road blocks". See example below (the indicator is seen better on the black chart background)  
  
[http://forex-indicators.net/files/in...m/freeway3.png](http://forex-indicators.net/files/indicators/mt4custom/freeway3.png)  
  
  
Road block show where the price can trip off - at support/resistance levels. Again we have different support/resistance levels for different time frames (different roads).

The indicator needs room on the right side of the chart in order to be seen.  
Make sure you've applied "Chart shift" property to the charts.

There are 3 ways to download an indicator from any webpage:  
1\. In Internet Explorer: right-click on the link, Save Target As..  
2\. In Firefox: right-click, Save Link As..  
3\. If you ever find a script for any indicator, then simply copy it and paste into a regular .txt file. Save the .txt file and then simply rename it to .mq4 - you've got a ready MT4 indicator!

All the CCI period are set to 50.  
All should be set to 50.  
If you want to change CCI settings, for example, make it 14 (or 34), then you have to change all four CCIs to 14 (or 34).

Some Questions and answers:  
(1)  
Q: On the freeway indicator, the color of the "roads" change. For example, both the green and red roads have various shades of green and red.......what exactly does this signify?  
  
A: Ok, on Forex_freeway indicator we've several colors: bright green, bright red and dark green, dark red.  
When it is dark (regardless the color) - the road is turned off. We don't use dark color roads at all.   
When it is light up in bright color - this is our directional signal to use:  
If you see all 4 bright green roads, you're good to go Long.  
If you see all 4 bright red roads - you're good to go Short.  
  
(2)  
Q: How does one knows how long it has been bright red or bright green so that i don't enter when the roads are at the peak of bright red or green ready for reversal?  
  
A: The only way to trade it earlier is to come when there are 3 roads highlighted and wait for the forth one to lit up. As an alternative use the [Forex freedom indicator](http://forex-indicators.net/mt4-indicators/forex_freedom)  
  
(3)  
Q: Thanks for all this indicator guide. I have install freeway and fractal. i noticed that the first one is light green while others are deep green and down also the first one is deep red and others are red, how will I interpret these.  
Also what point should I move into trade, is it when the price is in green region that I should go long and when price is in red region I should go short.  
  
A: The deep green are inactive roads, you don't use them. Only when the road is lit up in bright green or red, it shows a trend direction and is used as a signal along with other bright color roads.  
  
(4)  
Q: If I'm in a trade and one of the bars turn color do i exit the trade immediately or stay in?  
  
A: You can go either way, that's basically up to you how you want to use those trend signals.  
You can exit on the first change of color.  
Or you can wait till you get an opposite trading signal (e.g. - a change of all colors), so that you can close a Long trade and immediately go Short. It's up to you.  
  
(5)  
Q: How to Delete the Indicator if u want to. I tried its a pain to delete.   
  
A:You can delete the indicator by pressing right mouse on the chart and then go to indicator list  
press on the indicator you want to delete and then you will the on the right edit or delete press the delete.  
  
Tips:  
Dear Traders,

EURUSD, H1, 2012 February 10  
  
Indicators & Template, see attachment, please.  
  
  
Forex Freeway indicator is based on CCI indicator. In fact, it analyzes multiple CCI - from several time frames. There are 4 "roads" of Forex Freeway, read from left to right - 15min, 30min, 1 hour and 4 hours.  
  
The idea is to enter the market when all 4 CCI agree on a trend.  
A trader chooses which time frames to monitor.  
  
**Trading signals are interpreted the following way:**  
When all 4 roads of the Forex Freeway are green - Buy.  
When all 4 roads of the Forex Freeway are red - Sell.

Scalping Trading  
with Road Blocks  
  
This one has additional horizontal lines across the Freeways roads, called "Road blocks". See example below (the indicator is seen better on the black chart background)  
  
Road block show where the price can trip off - at support/resistance levels. Again we have different support/resistance levels for different time frames (different roads).

Indicators or Not? - A Matter of Experience?  
  
For understanding the Forex Market it seems an absolutely must to work out some concepts first with indicators before getting a feeling how illusive could indicators be. The CCI was left in the basket (for me) and in conjunction with the Price Action & the Pivotals, some Support/Resistance lines & the Multiple-Time-Frame-Analysis (MTFA) it might be absolutely adequate to make money. I'm not deeply relegious into indicators. To the contrary more I go the other way around and looking at first at the naked chart which tell me so much beforehand that I get a feeling in which way I should apply the CCI-Indicator and the Pivotals and the Focus at which time chart. Doing this needs experience. When indicators give me signals I'm either in the market "long" before or re-out again. Nevertheless the undergraduate study of Indicators could have a powerful impact of your successful activites in the Forex Market first and foremost when you are a newcomer in the Forex Market. So I bet all beginners to be concerned with the indicators above-mentioned (#[**1698**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5375657#post5375657), #[**1699**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5375662#post5375662), #[**1700**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5375663#post5375663) , #[**1701**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5375664#post5375664), #[**1702**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5375666#post5375666), #[**1703**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5375667#post5375667), #[**1704**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5375668#post5375668)).

**Leading vs. Lagging Indicators**  
  
We've already covered a lot of tools that can help you analyze potential trending and range bound trade opportunities. Still doing great so far? Awesome! Let's move on.  
In this lesson, we're going to streamline your use of these chart indicators.   
  
We want you to fully understand the strengths and weaknesses of each tool, so you'll be able to determine which ones work for you and which ones don't.   
  
Let's discuss some concepts first. There are two types of indicators: **leading** and **lagging**.  
  
A **leading** indicator gives a signal **before** the new trend or reversal occurs.  
  
A **lagging** indicator gives a signal **after** the trend has started and basically informs you "Hey buddy, pay attention, the trend has started and you're missing the boat."  
  
You're probably thinking, "Ooooh, I'm going to get rich with leading indicators!" since you would be able to profit from a new trend right at the start.   
You're right.   
You would "catch" the entire trend every single time, If the leading indicator was correct every single time. But it won't be.   
When you use leading indicators, you will experience a lot of fakeouts. Leading indicators are notorious for giving bogus signals which could "mislead" you.   
Get it? Leading indicators that "mislead" you?   
  
Haha. Man we're so funny we even crack ourselves up.  
  
The other option is to use lagging indicators, which aren't as prone to bogus signals.   
Lagging indicators only give signals after the price change is clearly forming a trend. The downside is that you'd be a little late in entering a position.   
Often the biggest gains of a trend occur in the first few bars, so by using a lagging indicator you could potentially miss out on much of the profit. And that sucks.  
It's kinda like wearing bell-bottoms in the 1980s and thinking you're so cool and hip with fashion....  
For the purpose of this lesson, let's broadly categorize all of our technical indicators into one of two categories:  

  1. Leading indicators or oscillators
  2. Lagging, trend-following, or momentum indicators

While the two can be supportive of each other, they're more likely to conflict with each other. We're not saying that one or the other should be used exclusively, but you must understand the potential pitfalls of each.

First of all...make not the absurdity and go in the market or out of the market concerning the indicators signals. That could be the best way to loose the money!

Maybe I will give some examples here and there this year how to use some leading and lagging indicators in certain cases of a market environment.  
Whatever indicators I will select more put into the analysis my prime selection, my first choice will be always the CCI, the MTFA (Multiple-Time-Frame-Analysis) and the Pivotals which increase the hundredfold the analysis.  
  
I know there are a lot of beginners here at board. For you it could be a support to a lesser extent for "graduated" traders.

Trading with "wellxAMA"  
  
**Learning to distinguish trend and range bound market conditions**  
One of the methods to distinguish range-bound conditions from trends is to look at the WellxAMA indicator. It allows us to switch our strategy according to the current market situation. If the WellxAMA indicator showing dots of the same color, it means the current trend continues. But if the WellxAMA indicator showing missing dots, it is an indication of a sideways moving market ahead.  
  
See further:  
[http://forex-strategies-revealed.com...owing-wellxama](http://forex-strategies-revealed.com/range-bound-trading/following-wellxama)  
  
Trading Rules:  
1\. As long as the dots are of the same color - the current trend continues.  
2\. Whenever a WellxAMA dot changinges color - the trend changes to the opposite.  
3\. If WellxAMA draws a new dot with every new chart candlestick - the market is trending.  
4\. Whenever a dot is missing - it is an indication of a sideways moving market ahead.  
(On the screen shot we can see that as an empty/bare thin light blue line stretching alongside several candlesticks in a row) - this means a trend is pausing and we may encounter range-bound conditions ahead.  
5\. What direction to follow when the WellxAMA dots are missing? Stick to the previous trend direction = the previous WellxAMA dot color before the range occurs.  
6\. If you're in a trade when WellxAMA starts to range, consider tightening your stops. If you haven't started trading - you may want to keep out until the trend is resumed.

Be aware  
Despite the nonexistence of the magic formula there are certainly high probability ways of trading the forex market. At FF the most comments are focused on the Method part, but you need to combine Method with both Money and Mind in order to attain success in the trading business.  
  
This thread hasn't the intention to get hold of the Holy Grail, whether it truly exists or not. A lot of traders seek the perfect formula that is capable of predicting with 100% accuracy the future price movements. Want to know where it lies? It only exists in the creative part of the mind - together with fairies and gnomes.  
  
I believe that an important factor of trading success lies in the matching of Method with the trader's own personality and trading style.  
  
"CCI-Trading" could be also used with Strategies like "Breakout Fading" or "Breakout Trading" or "Decreased Volatility Breakout" or in trends with steep gradients depending on your own risk appetite and could put in in other trading styles or in confirming trend direction and trend strength with oscillators (e.g. Stochastic, MACD). You can let it simple or could use it in a more complex way.

Scalping  
  
EURUSD, M1, 2012 February 13  
EURUSD, M5, 2012 February 13  
  
When Scalping it's important to react fast, efficient and realistic.  
Don't stay too long in the orders when scalping. +2 - +5 or +8 pips seems enough.  
The M1 and M5 charts below are selecting the same market situation. If you scalp, execute at M1 with regard at M5 and take a more global view at M15, M30, H1.  
  
I like to make my money solely at the CCI(14) due to the fact that it is the quickest indicator for me to make valuable market decisions. If I would put more indicators in the chart it could be only for some "Confirmation-Signals" demonstrated in the charts below. Could you show me some "Confirmation-Signals" here at M1?,...Yes?,...Fine!, ...and you can compare your result with the "conclusion-boxes" at #[**1730**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5378522#post5378522), please.  
  
The charts below includes more indicators than the CCI & the Pivotals for those traders, ...might be ...who need more indicators.

IKnow this is a Forex forum but I have a stock question.  
  
I can search for stocks that the CCI(14) is below -100 -200 -400  
  
Which would be best to look at. I want to investigate this method for stocks  
Thanks

Hi dryclean!  
One way to identify when a stock is greatly overbought or oversold is to look at the magnitude of the CCI. Extreme values over +300 or under -300 signal that a stock has moved way beyond its moving average making a correction highly likely. This “tell” is especially useful if you have a short position. Any move off an extremely negative CCI number is a signal to cover.   
  
Maybe look here:  
[http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.p...nnel_index_cci](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:commodity_channel_index_cci)  
<http://www.stockdisciplines.com/cci-signals>  
Google: "Stocks CCI Indicator" or so....  
Kindest regards

Search the internet for stockscreener. There you should be able to find one.

Once I used a software called Amibroker. There you could have done such a search. Maybe you can also look for Thinkorswim. I think with that you can do it also.

EURUSD, M1, 2012 February 13  
  
Scalping  
  
Once again:  
"Forex Freeway indicator" (see #[**1693**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5375566#post5375566)) is based on CCI indicator. In fact, it analyzes multiple CCI - from several time frames. There are 4 "roads" of Forex Freeway, read from left to right - 15min, 30min, 1 hour and 4 hours. I have change it into M1, M5, M15 and M30 to adapt this indicator for the Scalping and have set the CCI at 14.  
  
In this frame below with CCI(14).  
  
The Indicator <http://www.forexfactory.com/images/attach/mq4.gif> [Scalping, CCI14, M1,M5,M15,M30,Road Blocks, black.mq4](http://www.forexfactory.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=897334&stc=1&d=1329151013) (53.3 KB) includes the CCI(14) at M1, M5, M15 and M30 and could be used for Scalping Trades.

> Hi dryclean!  
>  One way to identify when a stock is greatly overbought or oversold is to look at the magnitude of the CCI. Extreme values over +300 or under -300 signal that a stock has moved way beyond its moving average making a correction highly likely. This “tell” is especially useful if you have a short position. Any move off an extremely negative CCI number is a signal to cover.

TRIX-Indicator  
  
EURUSD, M5, 2012 February 13  
  
**TRIX** is known as Triple Exponential Moving Average and is based on a 1-day difference of the triple EMA. The indicator was developed by Jack Hutson in 1980s. TRIX is a remarkable trend following-indicator: its main advantage over the similar indicators lies in its ability to filter a large portion of the market noise. TRIX eliminates short-term cycles (the cycles shorter than the selected TRIX period) which may interfere with trading by signaling about minor changes in market direction.  
  
TRIX reading above zero suggests an uptrend, while reading below - a downtrend.  
While above zero a rising TRIX line suggests acceleration higher while a declining line - still an upward move but at a slower pace, or a beginning of a reversal. Opposite true for the downtrend.   
  
I've set the Trix Indicator at Period: 5, Signal Period:3 and have change the color of the arrows (white for up / red for down)  
  
You could set it at 8/5 or 13/8, 8/3 or so what fits best for you.  
  
For M1 Scalping I feel better with the more noisy 5/3 one.  
  
More details, ...see here, please:

Using TRIX as a lagging indicator it could give some Confirmation signals.  
  
...and related to the CCI-Indicator TRIX could give a confirmation afterwards (see the red C-circles).

iPanel  
  
I'm sorry to say that the iPanel-Indicator exists unfortunately only in an *.ex4 file  
  
The iPanel-Indicator could be a great help when Scalping.  
  
Setting:  
Stochastics: PercentK: 8, PercentD: 3, Slowing: 3  
RSI: RSIP1: 14, RSIP2: 70  
MACD: FastEMA: 12, SlowEMA: 24, MACDsp: 6  
EMA-Settings: shortP1: 5, shortP2: 8, longP1: 26, longP2: 52 - (5/8 & 26/52)  
  
**How to trade with iPanel_Indicators.ex4**  
iPanel indicator scans signals from several Forex indicators across multiple time frames and transforms everything in a neat box with up and down arrows. Up - buy, down arrow - sell.  
The information box can be moved to any of the 4 chart corners by changing the settings parameter "Corner" from 1 to 2, 3 or 4 (e.g. see the picture below with the parameter "2").  
  
**What Indicators traders monitor with iPanel?**  
  
**Stochastic 8, 3, 3** \- iPanel shows position of 2 Stochastic lines %K and %D (on the screen shot above they would correspond to %K - red and D% - blue).   
When red is above blue - iPanel will show a red arrow, sell.  
When red is below blue - green arrow, buy.  
  
**RSI 14** \- When RSI reads above 50, it'll be an uptrend and a green arrow up, RSI below 50 - downtrend and the red arrow on iPanel pointing down.  
  
**CCI** \- (settings for CCI are unknown, unfortunately; my guess it might be 14 or 20.  
Either way this doesn't prevent us from simply reading CCI signals on iPanel: green arrow up - buy. Red arrow down - sell.  
  
On iPanel, CCI has a special status - it has an additional set of arrows - inclined up and inclined down arrows). These arrows have the following meaning:  
Inclined arrow up (green) - CCI is against Selling.  
Inclined arrow down (red) - CCI is against Buying.  
  
**MACD 12, 24, 6** \- remember you can change indicator settings. (You could put MACD back to standard 12, 26, 9 settings).  
MACD signals are the same as for Stochastic - simple lines crossover. On standard MT4 MACD it'll be a crossover of MACD signal line (in red) and MACD histogram.  
  
When MACD histogram is above zero and MACD signal line is hovering above the histogram - Sell.  
When MACD histogram is above zero and MACD signal line is trading inside the histogram - Buy.  
When MACD histogram is below zero and MACD signal line is hovering below the histogram - Buy.  
When MACD histogram is below zero and MACD signal line is trading inside the histogram - Sell.  
  
**EMA1** \- is a crossover signal from 2 MAs: 5 EMA and 8 EMA  
5 EMA above 8 EMA - buy, opposite - sell.  
  
**EMA2** \- is a crossover signal from 2 other MAs: 26 EMA and 52 EMA  
26 EMA above 52 EMA - buy, opposite - sell  
  
**What time frames are displayed on iPanel?**  
That shouldn't create difficulties, we have: 4 hour, 1 hour, 30 min, 15 min, 5 min and 1 minute charts.  
  
**How to use iPanel signals**  
As you can see, iPanel creates aggregated reports across multiple time frames and it sends lots of signals from a set of indicators. Taking all those signals into account when entering a trade would, most likely, be impractical - there is too much information to digest.   
  
An ideal case is when across multiple time frames you have the same signal for any particular indicator: for example, all green arrows for MACD across all time frames. You don't want to sell when you see this signal.  
  
Forex traders can develop some easy visual strategies based on this indicator, while for the rest  
your best bet is to use it as a navigator whenever a quick reference is needed to confirm a trade or double check if "anyone" [indicators] is against your decision.

USDJPY, Daily, 2012 February 13  
  
Swing Trading  
  
CCI-Top-and-Bottom-Trading (with TRIX-Confirmation in the aftermath).  
  
Daily seems great for making progressive money for the time being.  
  
I favor to trade solely the actual upside movements.

Rating Table  
Rating Table should be an independent valuation about Longer Term Trades with a more global view at the Daily-, Weekly- & Monthly Chart. The file is written in *.ods due to the fact that "Open Office" is a free ware word processor. Everybody could download it from the internet (e.g. <http://www.openoffice.org/>). When I have the time and the love to make some evaluation I write it in such a file, so I can overlook after a certain time. I think I will upload this file every so often.  
Column (8) includes sometimes the Monthly Highest Price, so it could give grounds for discretionary refusal [see column (7)] or potential sales. "Evaluation Date" [see (1)] is the amendment date.   
Maybe you should compare it sometimes with "Open Orders" (see #[**1755**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5381592#post5381592)) at [http://www.myfxbook.com/members/Fore...account/242992](http://www.myfxbook.com/members/Forexcube/10k-account/242992).

Hi danc!  
Unstable Market Situation!  
I think it's not the best time for H4 trading, cos the Daily could go more down, weekly up, monthly up. Instable Market Situation. (IMS).  
Trading with the Pivotals: see also #[**57056**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5383289#post5383289) , #[**56882**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5381648#post5381648) (Up 1.3165 > 1.3206 (H 1.3215); then Down 1.3206 - 1.3165; Profit: +41 +41 = +82 Pips).  
Kindest regards  
FXcube

Scalping  
  
Scalping could be a favored strategy if you could wait for your best market chance.  
  
Here it is an example how to trade around a pivotal point.  
  
M1 and M5 seems excellent and the more global look at M15, M30, H1 and H4 has given me additively some signals.

This is a good time for me to make some scalping trades.  
  
With regard to higher time frames you could make a more qualified analysis.  
  
Note:  
Don't overtrade!  
An outbreak could occur somewhere along the time.

The Power of Scalping  
  
The frames below illustrate how powerful Scalping could be!  
  
2012 February 14 16:14 CET: Closed Trades. +498.94$; Total Trades: 97, Loss Trades: 0  
2012 February 14 16:43 CET: Closed Trades. +780.34$; Total Trades: 138, Loss Trades: 0  
  
Profit: +2.8% within half an hour. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
(Target: 1% a Day)  
  
Professional Attitude  
You have to recognize the market situation with the best probability of making a profit.   
Never search to a Pareto-Optimum-Market-Condition, ...try to select steadily the Market Optimum, which the highest probability patterns which you could detect! If not, ...stay on the sideline and wait! Less could be more!  
  
Easy pickings?  
If you don't have the skills to detect a favored market condition, stay away from the "short term money - Forex Market" and adopt the faculties how to do it!  
  
Coin of Vantage  
If you try to scalp throughout the day you could lose all your money!

Hi dryclean!  
Whatever fits the best for you, it's okay! I use 14, other traders swear a parameter of 20 or higher. It might be not a great difference! It might be more a question of how to read the CCI in a right way (e.g. #[**1778**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5387102#post5387102), #[**1779**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5387122#post5387122),#[**1780**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5387130#post5387130)), fewer and fewer the value of the CCI.  
Best regards!

"Do The Right Thing" For Trade Breakouts   
December 12 2011  
  
Often in life, the right action is the hardest to take. The same dynamic occurs in trading. For most traders it is extremely difficult to buy tops and sell bottoms, because from a very early age we are conditioned to look for value and buy "cheap," while selling "dear." This is why, although most traders proclaim their love for trading with the trend, in reality, the majority love to pick [tops](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/atop.asp) or [bottoms](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bottom.asp). While these types of "turn" trades can be very profitable, turn trading can sometimes seem like a Sisyphean task, as price trends relentlessly in one direction, constantly stopping out the bottom and top pickers.   
  
****Tutorial:[**Top 10 Forex Trading Rules**](http://www.investopedia.com/university/forex-rules/)****  
  
Most traders are reluctant to buy [breakouts](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/breakout.asp), for fear of being the last one to the party before prices reverse with a vengeance. So, how can they learn to trade breakouts confidently and successfully? The "do the right thing" setup is designed to deal with just such a predicament. It tells the trader to buy or sell when most ingrained lessons are against doing so. Furthermore, it puts the trader on the right side of the trend, at the times when many other traders are trying to fade the price action. Read on as we cover this strategy and show you some examples of how it can be used.   
  
**Do the Right Thing  
**In the "do the right thing" strategy, the capitulation of top and bottom pickers in the face of a massive buildup of [momentum](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/momentum.asp), forces a covering of positions, allowing you to exit profitably within a very short period of time after putting on a trade.  
  
"Do the right thing" employs a rarely used indicator in FX called the [commodity channel index](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commoditychannelindex.asp) (CCI), which was invented by Donald Lambert in 1980 and was originally designed to solve engineering problems regarding signals. The primary focus of CCI is to measure the deviation of the price of the currency pair from its statistical average. As such, CCI is an extremely good and sensitive measure of momentum and helps us to optimize only the highest probability entries for our setup. (For background reading, see _[Timing Trades With The Commodity Channel Index](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/05/041805.asp)_.)  
  
Without resorting to the mathematics of the indicator, please note that CCI is an unbound oscillator, with a reading of +100 typically considered to be overbought and any reading of -100 considered oversold. For our purposes, however, we will use these levels as our trigger points, as we put a twist on the traditional interpretation of CCI. We actually look to buy if the currency pair makes a new high above 100 and sell if the currency pair makes a new low below -100. In "do the right thing" we are looking for new peaks or spikes in momentum that are likely to carry the currency pair higher or lower. The thesis behind this setup is that, much like a body in motion will remain so until it's slowed by counter forces, new highs or lows in CCI will propel the currency farther in the direction of the move, before new prices finally put a halt to the advance or the decline.  
  
**Rules for the Long Trade**  
1\. On the daily or the hourly charts, place the CCI indicator with standard input of 20.   
2\. Note the very last time the CCI registered a reading of greater than +100 before dropping back below the +100 zone.   
3\. Take a measure of the peak CCI reading and record it.   
4\. If CCI once again trades above the +100 and if its value exceeds the prior peak reading, go long at market at the close of the candle.   
5\. Measure the low of the candle and use it as your stop.   
6\. If the position moves in your favor by the amount of your original stop, sell half and move the stop to breakeven.   
7\. Take profit on the rest of the trade when the position moves to two times your stop.   
  
  
**Rules for the Short Trade  
1\. **On the daily or the hourly charts, place the CCI indicator with standard input of 20.   
2\. Note the very last time the CCI registered a reading of less than -100 before poking above the -100 zone.   
3\. Take a measure of the peak CCI reading and record it.   
4\. If CCI once again trades below the -100 and if its value exceeds the prior low reading, go short at market at the close of the candle.   
5\. Measure the high of the candle and use it as your stop.   
6\. If the position moves in your favor by the amount of your original stop, sell half and move the stop on the remainder of the position to breakeven.   
7\. Take profit on the rest of the trade when position moves to two times your stop.  
  
**CCI Setup On Longer Time Frames  
**In the daily chart of the EUR/USD pair (Figure 1) we see that the former peak high above the CCI +100 level was recorded on Sept. 5, 2005, when it reached a reading of 130. Not until more than three months later on Dec. 13, 2005, did the CCI produce a value that would exceed this number.   
  
Throughout this time, we can see that EUR/USD was in a severe decline with many false breakouts to the upside, that fizzled as soon as they appeared on the chart. On Dec. 13, 2005, however, CCI hit 162.61 and we immediately went long on the close at 1.194,5 using the low of the candle at 1.1906 as our stop. Our first target was 100% of our risk, or approximately 40 points. We exited half the position at 1.1985 and the second half of the position at two times our risk at 1.2035. Our total [reward-to-risk ratio](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskrewardratio.asp) on this trade was 1.5:1, which means that if we are only 50% accurate, the setup would still have positive expectancy. Note also that we were able to capture our gains in less than 24 hours, as the momentum of the move carried our position to profit very quickly.

Figure 1: Do the Right Thing CCI Trade, EUR/USD Source: FXtrekIntellichart   
  
For traders who do not like to wait nearly a quarter of a year between setups, the hourly chart offers far more opportunities for the "do the right thing" setup. It is still infrequent, which is one of the reasons that makes this setup so powerful; the common wisdom in trading is "the rarer the trade, the better the trade." Nevertheless, it occurs on the hourly charts far more often than on the dailies.  
  
In Figure 2, we look at the hourly chart of the EUR/USD between March 24 and March 28 of 2006. At 1 p.m. on March 24, the EUR/USD reaches a CCI peak of 142.96. Several days later at 4 a.m. on March 28, the CCI reading reaches a new high of 184.72. We go long at market on the close of the candle at 1.2063. The low of the candle is 1.2027 and we set our stop there.   
  
The pair consolidates for several hours and then makes a burst to our first target of 1.2103 at 9 a.m. on March 28. We move the stop to breakeven to protect our profits and are stopped out a few hours later, banking 40 pips of profit. As the saying goes, half a loaf is better than none, and it is amazing how they can add up to a whole bakery full of profits, if we simply take what the market gives us.

**CCI Setup On Shorter Time Frames  
**Figure 3 shows a short in the USD/CHF. This example is the opposite of the approach shown above. On Oct. 11, 2004, USD/CHF makes a CCI low of -131.05. A few days later, on Oct.14, the CCI prints at -133.68. We enter short at market on the close of the [candle](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/candlestick.asp) at 1.2445. Our stop is the high of that candle at 1.2545. Our first exit is hit just two days later at 1.2345. We stay in the trade with the rest of the position and move the stop to breakeven. Our second target is hit on Oct. 19, no more than five days after we've entered the trade.  
  
The total profit on the trade? 300 points. Our total risk was only 200 points, and we never even experienced any serious drawdown, as the momentum pulled prices farther down. The key is high probability, and that is exactly what the "do the right thing" setup provides.

Figure 3: Do the Right Thing CCI Trade, USD/CHF Source: FXtrekIntellichart   
  
Figure 4 shows another example of a short-term trade, this time to the downside in the EUR/JPY. At 9 p.m. on March 21, 2006, EUR/JPY recorded a reading of -115.19 before recovering above the -100 CCI zone. The "do the right thing" setup triggered almost perfectly five days later, at 8 p.m. on March 26. The CCI value reached a low of -133.68 and we went short on the close of the candle. This was a very large candle on the hourly charts, and we had to risk 74 points as our entry was 140.79 and our stop was at 141.51.   
  
Many traders would have been afraid to enter short at that time, thinking that most of the selling had been done, but we had faith in our strategy and followed the setup. Prices then consolidated a bit and trended lower until 1 p.m. on March 27. Less than 24 hours later we were able to hit our first target, which was a very substantial 74 points. Again we moved our stop to breakeven. The pair proceeded to bottom out and rally, taking us out at breakeven. Although we did not achieve our second target overall, it was a good trade as we banked 74 points, without ever really being in a significant drawdown.

**When "Do the Right Thing" Does You Wrong**  
Figure 5 shows how this setup can go wrong and why it is critical to always use stops. The "do the right thing" setup relies on momentum to generate profits. When the momentum fails to materialize, it signals that a turn may be in the making. Here is how it played out on the hourly charts in AUD/USD. We note that CCI makes a near-term peak at 132.58 at 10 p.m. on May 2, 2006. A few days later at 11 a.m. on May 4, CCI reaches 149.44, prompting a long entry at .7721. The stop is placed at .7709 and is taken out the very same hour. Notice that instead of rallying higher, the pair reversed rapidly. Furthermore, as the downside move gained speed, prices reached a low of .7675. A trader who did not take the 12-point stop, as prescribed by the setup, would have learned a very expensive lesson, as his losses could have been magnified by a factor of three. Therefore, the key idea to remember with our "do the right thing" setup is, "I am right or I am out!"

**The Bottom Line  
**"Do the right thing" allows traders to trade breakouts confidently and successfully. CCI can put you on the right side of a trade when many others are trying to fade the price action. However, this setup only works if you apply it along with disciplined stops to protect you from major losses if the expected momentum fails to materialize.

Forex CCI Indicator Explained  
May 16, 2010 by [Kelvin](http://www.forexindicator.org/author/Kelvin)   
  
The CCI indicator is known as the Commodity Channel Index and this is an indicator that is developed by Donald Lambert.  
I will not bother you with the calculation of this indicator because your trading platform can automatically help you to calculate and plot out the indicator. What I am going to share with you today is what exactly this indicator can do for you and how you can integrate it to your trading plan.  
For this CCI indicator, it will come with +100 and -100 levels. Most of the time, this indicator will move in between the +100 and -100 levels and it will exceed the levels for about 20 to 25% of the time.  
  
**Here is what you can use the CCI for:**  
  
**_1) As a buy and sell signal_** – Whenever you see the CCI moving above the +100 level, you are in fact in a period of strong uptrend and this is the time you can enter a LONG trade. Once the CCI moves back to the +100 level, you should then exit your trade.  
However when you see the CCI moving below the -100 level, you are in a strong downtrend period and you can enter a SHORT trade. Similar to the above LONG trade, you should exit your trade once the CCI move up to the -100 level.

Buy & Sell Signal  
  
From the picture above, you can see that the market move higher when CCI reaches the +100 level and vice verse.

**_Follow-up  
  
2) As a reversal identifier_** – There are basically 3 ways you can make use of the CCI indicator to [identify reversal](http://www.forexindicator.org/forex-candlestick-reversal-pattern-tutorial-1-railway-track.html) and I am going to go through one by one in detail.  
  
**a) Trend Line Break:** You can make use of the CCI to draw trend line and once you see the trend line being breached, you are going to see the market moving in the direction of the [breakout](http://www.forexindicator.org/my-forex-breakout-strategy-revealed.html).  
  
[](http://www.forexindicator.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/TrendLine.png)[http://www.forexindicator.org/wp-con.../TrendLine.png](http://www.forexindicator.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/TrendLine.png)  
Trend Line Break  
  
**b) CCI Divergence** : Similar to [MACD divergence](http://www.forexindicator.org/how-to-trade-macd-divergence.html), the CCI also produces positive and negative divergences. When you see the market making higher highs while the CCI making lower highs, you are in fact seeing a negative divergence. This is usually a signal that the market is going to move down but the time it takes for the down move may vary and you should not assume that it is coming in the next few candles.  
  
[](http://www.forexindicator.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Positive-Divergence.png)[http://www.forexindicator.org/wp-con...Divergence.png](http://www.forexindicator.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Positive-Divergence.png)  
Positive Divergence  
  
If you see the price making lower lows while the CCI making higher lows, it is a sign of positive divergence and the market is going to produce an upward movement soon. Similarly, you should not assume that it is going to happen very soon.  
  
[](http://www.forexindicator.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Negative-Divergence.png)[http://www.forexindicator.org/wp-con...Divergence.png](http://www.forexindicator.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Negative-Divergence.png)  
Negative Divergence  
  
**c) Overbought & Oversold:** Similar to the Stochastic and the [Relative Strength Index](http://www.forexindicator.org/forex-relative-strength-index-indicator-explained.html), the CCI can be used as an oscillator. When you see this indicator moving above the +200 level, you are in an overbought zone and you can place a SHORT trade when you see the CCI crossing below the +100 level.  
When you see the indicator moving below the -200 level, you are in an oversold zone and you can then place a LONG trade once you see the indicator moving above the -100 level.  
  
[](http://www.forexindicator.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Overbought.png)[http://www.forexindicator.org/wp-con...Overbought.png](http://www.forexindicator.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Overbought.png)  
Overbought & Oversold  
  
However there is nothing that works 100% of the time and below is one such example  
[](http://www.forexindicator.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Overboughtdunwork.png)[http://www.forexindicator.org/wp-con...ghtdunwork.png](http://www.forexindicator.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Overboughtdunwork.png)  
Example  
  
The CCI indicator has been a great help to my trading so far and it can be integrated into various type of trading methods due to its multi-features. You can try this indicator out in your trading chart and see how it performs for you .

Be careful, my friend!  
#[**1783**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5387215#post5387215) could be also possible.  
The market seems extremely choppy. Price fluctuations seems possible at all hours. Take a look at the longer H1/H4 candles, please.  
I would set a Stop Loss whithin the winning zones.

**Tips and Facts about Scalping in Forex**  
  
**The only way to make small account big in a short period of time is through the use of really high leverage.** But wait... do not jump of the cliff right away. Start with reasonable leverage for scalping, for example 20:1 or at most 50:1, then move on as you see scalping skills improve. But even before that do not be lazy to demo trade your scalping system – make sure it will not disappoint you later...

EURUSD, M5, 2012 February 15  
  
The great power of the Pivotals in conjunction with some price movements at increasing volatility you could see at the M5 chart below.  
A retracement at DS1 1.3067 with a CCI-Bottom seems high-probably.  
The price movements has stopped at mS1 1.3104.  
  
Noctambulation?  
If you win more and more experience when trading the Forex Market you could detect these higher probability patterns a lot easier. It's like a sleepwalk!   
Kindest regards

When I say _"and FXcube's advices on the other hand!"_ I mean trading technique advices, like CCI div. and so. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f918.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
  
Take care, and keep up the good trading. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f973.png?v=15.1)

Nice!  
Could you show your CCI if that is what you used to determine your entry If not then what?  
Thanks

Hi !  
  
Sorry for the delay regarding your request...  
  
Here goes the picture you asked for, with the CCI. I had value 14 today, but 28 yesterday because I was trying new values, so don't get confused. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
I think you are free to use diferent CCI values and even two boards with CCi at the same time!   
  
Don't forget MTFA...my entrys were not decided using only M1.  
  
Best regards,  
Hatzerim

Here is a good example  
  
How would you handle this gap move .... would you wait and for how long or play it off the pivot if the CCi hooks

Don't trust DEMO Accounts!  
  
It has nothing to do with the real life trading!  
  
Demo Accounts don't tell the truth about the real Life Trading!  
  
Why didn't this account close due to the fact of the Margin Call?  
  
Downright ridiculous!

Hi dryclean!  
I don't know. It seems currently an instable market situation for me, H4, Daily, Weekly & Monthly could go further up.  
I try to trade the Daily Range currently at H4 (See #[**1816**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5399059#post5399059), please)...and will manage some Scalping Trades (M1) around different Pivotals this day.

Dear trader!  
Due to the fact that some traders are stupidly copy my demo account trades and copy it further to signal services I have decide not to publish Demo Trading any more. It's better when you manage you trading by yourself and will give your trading ideas here at this board.

That's great idea,   
  
many people avoid MC from that martingale trading with no SL.

Dear Forex Cube,  
  
If you look back once, let me tell you that your system is working like a Swiss Clock. Inspired by your topic I decided to go Live.   
  
Only 3 trades yet but the last one was like blessing. With the CCI, Divs, MTF you could see the results of the news for the cable before it was announced.  
  
I attached 2 pictures. Let me dedicate my 32 pips for you!  
  
Thank you so much! I will keep looking for more patterns like this and will keep my self to the rules.  
  
Best Regards FC   
  
pm.: To all who might have just started reading this topic. BEST CHOICE EVER!

Greetings Traders, Hello Forexcube,  
  
the first thing I would like to do is to use this thread to say a great thank you to Forexcube for opening my eyes on trading. I've been a "silent reader" of all your threads, which are a wealth of knowledge. One of your thoughts has been the most important for me, namely you once stated that we should set our risk and reward so that we feel comfortable with it- and I thought that the most common approach, the usual money management rules are not that important as our own comfort, mental comfort, the freedom of action, so that I no longer get stressed when I face a loss. Now I know that if not this time, I will turn a profit the next time. No stress. I trade grid style, do recovery trades if the market does not go my way, it is stressful but since I came across your writings I do it differently, for less profit, with less risk. I stick to 0,25% of daily profit, low expectations keep the risk low, and my head cool.  
  
Forexcube, I wish you all the best, and I wish to all of the traders to find their comfort zone in Forex war zone.

I've tried to compile that good indicator with the actual metaeditor, but i'm failing to resolve all the errors. Have changed all '.' with '_' (except for numeric value of course, 1.5 stay 1.5) but there is still lot of errors mainly due to the 'if' declarations no more accepted as before. Wonder if a skilled fellow here could glance at that issue and make some fixes. Thanks.

Try this, it is recompiled with MT v509. Delete the file .mq4 and use only this .ex4

Thanks Rob  
I'v tried to compile with an old 509 too; metaeditor509 seems to do its job, but the compiled file (supposed) cant be found (even inside /tmp dir, or elsewhere). So i'm trying to adapt the initial code to build600+ , but still fail to remove all of the errors.  
  
  
  
its also my hard way to learn the new coding style !!!! but hey i still have a lot to go ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1)

For me this indicators don't work. It's not possible to attach it to a graphic.

I have not finished to read the thread yet, I am at page 40.....  
  
Last two days I have been applying the 1/10 rule on a small account not demo, made nearly 1% (0.5% per day)  
  
Made 18 trades, 3 losses and one BE = +101 pips.  
  
My biggest win was 38.8 pips, my biggest loss was -20.7 pips but I took two more trades at the extreme and gained 16.1 pips.  
  
Looks promising but mostly importantly the style fits my persona...... still have a lot of work to do.....  
  
Thank you FC

Hi   
  
It will take time to master it, had a tough day yesterday shorting EJ and UJ, prices continued upward...I did hedge and recovered some money....  
  
Made money on all the other pairs but finished in negative for the day which was my first day finishing that way  
  
Going back and reviewing the charts on both the above pairs I can see they were both O/S on the 4h and the 30m was showing some kind of bullish divergence the previous day.  
  
Price Action needs to be taken in consideration also, before my entries the hourly candle were showing bullish business, maybe I should have been looking for hidden divergence instead in the direction of the least resistance, hey but it is all easy in hindsight.....  
  
I think the method has merit, I like it, made money on UC,AU, GU and EU but got stuck in my own conviction when the tape was telling differently, strong trend will always be showing divergences and O/B and O/S and if we do not use a stop loss we can be caught when we are not reading properly.......  
  
Hope it helps a bit.  
  
ZenNy

As FC mentioned he has supplied a platform, it is up to us to make fit our personality.  
  
I have been working on it for a while and intensively now on this method and adjusted for what make sense to me.  
  
This is my last scalp trade made today during Asian session (uj 15m), all my three TF's were O/B and two were showing bearish divergence and above 200, prices hit R1 and I went short, my risk was 32 pips (0.5) and made 64 pips.

FC is right, having a stop loss is not a great solution, one has to find his way based on his own personality and his own tolerance on risk.  
  
Raging market are the best by fading the previous high/low when overbought/oversold taking in consideration at least 3 timeframes.  
  
Is best to avoid strong trends, in those cases is best for a major trend line to be broken first and then fade the new extreme.  
  
Done for the day, +3.7% up.

Today traded UJ, AU and GU short, EU long and short.  
  
Made money also when the trade was going against me.  
  
Still I have two trades running, made 2.71 % today.  
  
Seems I cannot make less than 2% per day, which is very encouraging.  
  
I have not finished the thread yet, still have 20 pages to go but seems I have done my home work properly. I have blended my understanding and personality with FC insights.  
  
This is my last post on this thread, I wanted to give my input with a few posts to thank FC's generosity. Thank you FC, you have guided me rightly.

I think it does not fit my personality, I do not have enough guts trading without stop loss.  
  
I did try trading with a larger SL but at the end many trades went against me and I went down -27%, which is not pleasant. (swing)  
  
Day trading I started well but when a trade went against me it would eat all my previous profits.  
  
Said that this way works well for FC, he is up nearly 300% in a short time span, but I am not sure it is easy for others, certainly not for me.  
  
I am back the way I used to trade but following and studying FC TE is giving me a real understanding of what my stake should be and how much I should risk despite trading with a protective SL.  
  
I think I can combine my experience in trading with what I have learn from his generosity.  
  
FC means business, I cannot see any other on here at his level, he is an inspiration and one day I hope making more money then he does.(dreaming)

Forexcube is obviously a successful trader, but I have no clue how he trades (assuming he wasn't just cherry-picking his best trades). The first several pages of this thread consist of various CCI systems that are copied and pasted from different sources.

Hello Traders,  
  
I am looking for CCI that finds divergences and hidden divergences at overbought and oversold zones (whatever the set of OB OS are for example +200 or -200).  
  
Can anyone help me with that.  
  
Thank you.

Hi there!  
  
I guess that the way Forexcube trade it was the best.  
You just read the first topic slowly and trade it with a demo account. You'll get the essence of it.  
Don't forget to enter small trades. Place TP and SL.  
  
The systems form Forexcube were simple but with lots of posts...a bit fascinating and....confusing if you didn't got  
the essence of the system and sticked to it.  
**My advice:** Read all, use what woks for you.  
  
Cheers,  
H.
