Hello guys, go on daily chart back as you can go till now and search for these type of candles:  
  
Bullish signal: false breakout/rejection of the low of the previous day, better if the shadow of the signal candle is long enough, AND THEN close ABOVE previous day high  
  
Use pending orders above current candle high if it completely engulf the previous day high.  
0.02 size? 0.01 with a TP big like the signal candle, 0.01 pending order without TP, SL below the min of the pattern; It is just an idea, try your own gestion.  
  
OPPOSITE for bearish signals  
  
You can search also on weekly and monthly  
  
We have also a second type of signal (bearish, screenshot 1 and 6): if the signal candle has all the prerequisites but doesn't close under the previous day's low, BUT close BELOW the open of the previous day, put a pending order not on the signal candle' low, but on the low of the previous day. Note it is not a powerful signal like the first.  
  
Additional rules:  
  
Rule n°1  
  
-Trade _**ONLY**_ Daily, Weekly and Monthly.  
  
Rule n°2  
  
-WAIT for the candle _**CLOSE**_  
  
_**Don't try to anticipate the market. You aren't a magician or a time traveller. You must wait.**_  
  
My backtest's results on GBP/NZD (daily) 1-2 years: 20440 pips (including SL and with TP on every last high).  
Go on charts, do your backtests and report here, i challenge you to fail ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
  
**Obviously the signals must be contextualized. More things you know, more informations you have and greater the edge**  
  
“If you have an apple, and i have an apple, and we exchange it, then you and i always have an apple for one. But if you have an idea, and i have an idea, and we exchange it, then we both have two ideas”

I know what you are thinking: "But it's just an engulfing" mmmh, yes and no... sometimes yes... you'll see. Search and stick to the rules

Guys before other questions: this is a thing that i noticed 2 months ago  
  
So i don’t know now what could be the optimal MM for this. I think splitting the size and open two orders, one without TP and maybe with Trailing or just BE, and one TP big like the signal candle it’s good. But i haven’t studied it a lot of time  
  
I hope you can help me improving this :-) Cheers

Joseph - to be clear, we are just trying to understand your back test results first, before worrying about MM. I am also assuming the 20440 pips in the back-test are "pipettes"? If this is the case then the results in pips would be 2044 pips (i.e. for GBPNZD its $7.31 USD per pip). <https://www.mataf.net/en/forex/tools/pip-value>. Cheers.

Just do your backtests if you want (daily or weekly) and try to go in negative. Then we’ll look for improving this.

No offense, it's just an observation that I wanted to share. You can consider it good or bad, it does not change my life.

There's a number of things wrong here. First of all, what are you offering to those who take you up on your challenge and prove it doesn't work?  
  
Now for the errors or unclear aspects of your strategy explanation.  
  
1) Your opening graphic shows a line and "PO here" text with no explanation as to what "PO here" means. Further, the line marking "PO here" just doesn't follow the rules of your strategy from what I can tell.  
  
2) Sunday days. Your charts include lots of small bars every 5 days which indicates your showing Sunday days. This can screw things up if your basing breakouts from a few hours of price action on a Sunday. Anyone doing daily chart analysis needs to ignore Sunday days and/or better yet get with a charting program and broker/server which shows days based on NY close (GMT +2/3) and therefore doesn't show small Sunday days on daily charts.  
  
3) "Sell limit below" In one image you described a "sell limit order below..." when I believe what you mean to say is to set a "sell stop" order. Big difference.  
  
I'm sure there's more, but, that's some of the erroneous details I've spotted so far.  
  
Note: I think it's awesome people share their excitement about their strategy ideas here. But, as the saying goes, "the devil's in the details." And, as the trading market knows "those who don't nail the details go to hell." ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f600.png?v=15.1)

Thank's for the correction. Sometimes I get confused between sell stop and sell limit, i'm not very good in english. PO is pending order.  
  
Regard the rest, just observations. I'd like to see other backtests on other pairs, that's it. If it is "Bullshit" ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f602.png?v=15.1) we'll ignore it and we will move on  
  
Regard the "offer" i'm not offering nothing. If you lose you got something that could work. If you win it's still a good thing

Hello, i don't know! But i think it's better if you don't search under the 4hours... let me know! And i'm looking that on all 28 pairs

So, NZDUSD would be a possible candidate... buy stop placed above 2nd candle from the right...

How do you define a fake breakout?  
  
On the first picture there is no fake breakout. The price actually did break out to the down side.

That's the problem with this thread and the described "strategy." While well-intended I think there's some confusion on the part of the author of this thread. Accordingly, take it all with a grain of salt.

I can only guess at it but I think he meant rejection to the downside not fakebreakout.  
  
But its just a guess.

So can we first get a indicator developed to identify this pattern/formation, cuz as of right now all I see is a rejection on some MA (not sure what period) and the pattern hasnt really been described. Or am I missing something?

Thanks for sharing to the OP.  
  
You could also try:  
  
1\. bearish candle.  
2\. next, bullish candle that closes above the open of previous.  
3\. next, within the next few (1 to 5) candles, look for a candle that closes below the open of bullish candle in step 2.  
4\. then finally, enter sell and target the low of the bullish candle in step 2.  
  
As another user mentioned earlier, you could come up with many other patterns by looking at the charts. I noticed this one a few minutes ago while I was trying to figure out the OPs description.

Hello, i don’t think you need a indicator. Actually it takes to me just 5 min for search on all 28 pairs. It’s a pattern very easy to spot

The point is that the rejection/shadow must be LONGER than the previous one day

By the way, notice how a consolidation formed between the HIGHs of the two candles. Might be an opportunity on a lower tf.  
I wonder how often this occurs.

Yes you Are right. I’d not consider the candles with a very very long shadow and very small candles. But it’s all to verify and study! Thank you  
  
anyway we would taken only the one with the red arrow, then we would moved the stop at least at BE. Because I think it s not a good idea add positions.  
  
The ideal (and basic) setups for me are the screenshots number 2,3,4,5 in post 1

We can use an oscillator to exit our positions. For example if we take take a long we will exit when the price is overbought (70 line or whatever). The opposite for short positions. Obviously, this kind of exit works better if we take a position that agrees with the overall trend.  
Look at the pictures. The rectangle is the pattern, the white horizontal line the point of entry and the vertical red line the point when the price reaches the overbought zone.

The problem is that some kind of oscillators when they are in overbought The pair is just trending and it could remain in overbought for 2 months. Elder say that there are two types of indicators, one is good for spot highs and lows, one for trends... we must choice the good one for this

Nice system, what makes this pattern important is that its a wick pattern + CS pattern, (wick)short/long + (CS)Bull/Bear means sell, (wick)short/long + (CS)bear/bull means buy

And i think also that the point of strength of this "entry method" is that the SL is tight compared to the potential TP: If you lose one, you'll recover with interest in the next trade

Joseph, the NZDCAD example is nice. Unfortunately, it is very easy to cherry-pick examples from the past. Not all the valid signals are at the beginning of a major trend. I have yet to see the money management approach - TP/SL at least - that would allow anyone to determine if you could in fact gain the 1000 pips in the example provided, and further from a more general perspective "if you could fail with this"!

Hello,  
  
It's called an 'Outside' bar. There is an indicator for this on FF.  
Just put Outside bar into the search window.  
  
One indicator I found highlights both Inside and Outside bars.  
  
Enjoy!

Nothing happens when this indicator is placed onto a chart.

it works - look for a red or blue line vertically through the candle - you can change the colour

maybe someone able could fix this good EA, adding manual Stop Loss and trailing stop? I tested it on Daily with EurNzd and CadJpy and is working fine. The stop is way too large as it is in the EA.

I suggest to ignore any EA or indicator/alert  
  
in the case of indicator, if it could help us as a filter and in entries and exits, why not... but ignore the rest pls. Focus just on price action and candles

according to your rules the signal candle must close above the previous days HIGH for long trades. In your NU example, this did not happen for the last 2 green boxes. Is this correct?

Can you kindly check the image below and let me know if the Blue Boxes are potential Buy opportunities and if Red Boxes are Sell scenarios?

If these patterns are correct, based on the second candle closure, I should decide for Market Order (BUY/SELL) or Pending Order(BUYSTOP/SELLSTOP)  
  
Please confirm if my understanding is correct.

Hello,  
Should the trading rules be:  
BUY  
False breakout of the low price of the previous day candle,   
better if the tail of the signal candle is (0.2/3cm) long   
AND THEN the current candle closes ABOVE previous day candle CLOSE price.  
  
SELL  
False breakout of the high price of the previous day candle,   
better if the tail of the signal candle is (0.2/3cm) long   
AND THEN the candle closes BELOW previous day candle CLOSE price.  
  
Clearly, I am easily confused but, scanning charts today and re-reading this great thread made me wonder if the above is correct?  
Thank you

I think your assessment as to whether these buy/sell boxes are "potential" candidates is accurate. However, it is apparent that not all are winners. I think we need a means to filter out ones that are at the end of a move (e.g. an indicator, oscillator, or maybe just plain 'ol price structure, etc). I took your same chart and added a couple just to see if anything made sense at a glance and they seemed to help. That was 5 minutes worth of work, so I'm not saying it is absolutely the way to go, but it at least points me in a direction to keep testing this theory to see if it is profitable.  
[EDIT]  
BTW, I think measuring a candle's shadow/tail length by inches/cm's is worthless (really? .2 inches??). How/why in the world would I want to do that? I might have a 10" computer screen or a 32" screen. I might have my price action window scrunched up. Wouldn't it be better to refer to a candle's tail/shadow length as a percentage of the body? I've even seen an indicator on FF that does that...if you have a mind to do that sort of thing.

Anyway guys don’t try to complicate the things and don’t hyperanalize. All what you need is in the first 2 pages: I’ve explained all with perfection and a lot of examples.  
  
Just try to do a backtest starting from where your broker candles start (it could be 2008 or 2000)and to try to fail. You’ll see that without any type of analysis (short term trend, mid term, long term, levels, W1, MN etc) you will have a decent result.  
Actually only one person did the backtest and it resulted positive.

That could be stated as:  
  
Buy if,  
1\. candle (0) is bearish  
2\. candle (1) is bullish and closes above open of candle (0)  
  
Sell if,  
1\. candle (0) is bullish  
2\. candle (1) is bearish and closes below open of candle (0)  
  
You could also try [this](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=10697936#post10697936) to see but, I'm still not sure what the exact rules are.

I don't see that the SL is tighter than the TP: you enter when price breaks the high of the signal candle, your TP is the size of the signal candle and the SL is below the signal candle. So wouldn`t r:r be 1:1 - SL = TP?

2 problems i see with this.  
  
**Problem 1. The balance of SL and TP:**  
  
The problem with this system is the SL and TP. If we use the length of the previous candle and a 1:1 ri:re, the SL may be to close and we can get stopped out or the TP may be to far and never get reached and then we get stopped out if we go by just the size of previous candle.  
  
I think the system has good entry and we see many wins backtesting but not having the proper SL/TP is balance is what will give losses.  
  
  
**Solution for Problem 1:**  
  
We use ATR to measure the average size of a candle over the past 10 candles and we can say 1 ATR is our SL and 1 ATR our TP. This way we know the average volatility of the market and what it is capable of and we can give ourselves 1 or even 2 ATR room for SL, and we wont have to ask too much from the market for our TP since it will be easier for the market to give us 1 ATR(1 candle basically which is a small move to ask from the market) of profit instead of asking the market for a random TP that we just make up that happens to be way too far which is basically asking too much of from the market.  
  
example:  
  
pic below shows ATR at bottom right corner is 64 pips. so in the trade SL and TP both set at 64 pips

**Problem 2. Strong level to protect the SL and driving force to push price to TP**  
  
Another issue that makes setting the right SL/TP difficult is the fact that this is based on a pattern of 2 candles and buy/sell stops, so there is no level support or resistance or any level that we can use to protect our SL and say "ok price probably wont break this level so our SL is protected here" and there is no driving force or logic that we know of that is strong enough to push price to reach our TP.  
  
  
**Solution to Problem 2:**  
  
I do not know

Attention, i said the potential tp.You’re right about the fact that 1:1 isn’t good, that’s why I said to split the size and set one trade with the target and another without. You can see you can catch very big movements and this will be the trades that will pay for our all eventually losses with interest

I mean that on every signal you could split your size. Let's assume you trade 0.02 lot. With 0.01 you'll set your TP as the size of candle, other 0.01 without tp. So, like that, we have 3 scenarios:  
  
\- Both positions will hit your SL (that is tight compared to the POTENTIAL/infinite TP)  
-1 will hit tp, 1 SL= 0 loss and 0 gain  
-One will hit tp and one will run= Thousands of pips who will recover all your losses with interest. This is why i think in the long term with a very good MM, it works

Thanks for your effort to explain the pattern.   
  
However I still would like to be sure if I understood this correct.  
  
There are always 1 bull a bear candle to make a pattern.  
You enter Pending Buy Order at the high of Bull 2nd candle after it closes.  
You enter Pending Sell Order at the low of Bear 2nd candle after it closes.  
Does the 2nd candle need to be certain size as compared to 1st candle? Does their wick need to be certain size?  
  
Note: I use the term 1st candle and 2nd candle. I refer to them as the 1st candle of the pattern and 2nd candle of the pattern(newer)

Thanks for sharing your idea here but this is really confusing.  
Does the pattern involve 2 candles? 3 candles? or it depends?

You have all what you need for understand the concept in first two pages. You'll find mine explanations, i know my english is not good, but i don't think it's impossible to understand and anyone who has spent at least 200 hours on charts can understand easily what i want to communicate. I have posted also a lot of examples and other traders has explained it again and again.  
  
I reccomend to all if you are a newbie or if you don't have experience in trading to just study first the basics of the forex and market in general and leave this thread or the final result will be that you are only confused.

I noticed that this pattern often appear in a lot of price action dynamics. I hope you understand my intention it's not to blindly trade 2 candles but to make a valid and proved entry signal (anyway if you'll enter without analysis you'll gain)  
  
Edit: In second screenshot i mean double top. I get confused with english sorry

Where is the double bottom on the second picture? do you mean double top? Double bottom is a long signal and i think you are going short on second example. Using the wrong terms in screenshots will confuse people. Just a small tip ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
Also what do you mean you closed the trade after marobozu green candle? you are short on this trade so why would that marobozu green candle matter?

Yes, double top sorry.  
  
I was in the trade through the weekly pattern and then I closed on daily after the Marubozu because of fear, lack of discipline and patience

Hi Joseph95  
If the entry is not confirmed the following day after the signal candle, do you cancel your pending order, or leave it in place? If you leave the pending order in place how many days?

We all need to use the same SL and TP in order to compare backtest results.  
Every trade is in 2 positions: 1 position with SL under or above the signal candle and TP the same amount of pips as the SL.........no confusion there.  
  
2nd position: SL under/above the signal candle and TP left open.  
I guarantee you that to get thousands of pips from this position will be one hell of a wild ride, next to impossible in my opinion.  
  
Joseph could you explain how you handled your SL and TP for the 2nd position to get your 20,440 pips?  
Then I would be able to backtest in the same way to compare results for other pairs.  
thank you![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

what was your winning percentage in your backtest results? what is your win rate with forward testing results. i think you should set up trade explorer. its easy. just git to your forex factory profile page and click on trade explorer and follow directions

Cool bro. Good luck. Also do you think its better to trade this pattern perhaps on smaller timeframes so we dont get hit with news and swap costs? Because it can take a couple days for a trade to hit TP and in that time who knows what may happen

Thank you :-) Smaller timeframes are full of noise, and here is where you could be hit by the news. Swaps aren’t a problem, we re talking about some cents.  
Anyway For this trading approach i prefer daily and weekly, but this doesn't mean you can't make money with this on smaller tf

Strong level to protect the SL and driving force to push price to TP Another issue that makes setting the right SL/TP difficult is the fact that this is based on a pattern of 2 candles and buy/sell stops, so there is no level support or resistance or any level that we can use to protect our SL and say "ok price probably wont break this level so our SL is protected here" and there is no driving force or logic that we know of that is strong enough to push price to reach our TP.

Solution to Problem 2= Round numbers, it's a psychological support and resistance tool.

Maybe we should test this on lower time frame like m5 or m15 just to get some data and some trades in because daily chart trades take for eveeeeeeeeeeeeeeerrr hahaaha

Spread? what? come on man. If you dont know how to handle spread issues then youre in the wrong business but I'll explain.  
  
If youre on a 5 min chart, find pairs that have high volatility measured by atr where average size of 1 candle is like 10-15 pips and/or trade pairs with low [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide").  
  
If youre on the 15 min chart, find pairs that have high volatility measured by atr where average size of 1 candle is like 10-15 pips and/or trade pairs with low spreads.  
  
If neither of the aforementioned works, change your broker.

It's a good thread; maybe everyone is busy researching because there are other similar patterns that will work just as well as this one. I described on in a previous post one such thing [here](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=10697936#post10697936), and [here](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=10701189#post10701189).

I gived you an input. The rest is up to you. I asked all to do a backtest and only one person did.  
  
After the backtests with a tp on last HH or LL we could have studied a MM and when to exit ecc.  
  
Please don't look my trade explorer regard this and don't get discouraged because here i have 20 euro and a drawdown of 1 euro will show like a huge loss... it's just an old account that i'm trying to recover.

Im getting pretty bad backtest results on EURAUD starting from year 2000. like 40% win rate :/  
  
Another problem is the pattern is sort of tough to keep looking for when backtesting so I always feel like I missed a set up while backtesting haha

Ok even with trend not very good results backtesting on Uswiss. Around 50% winrate. I think the system just lacks logic. There is no logic that will protect the SL and there is no logic that will drive price to reach TP. What is pushing price? just a break of a low? thats not enough to reach TP and protect SL. I think everyone else has had mixed results with this as well which is why no one is posting but me lol. Creative idea though. Just needs more logic. Good luck

@Joseph95,  
  
Are the trade results on your trade explorer for the past 30 days directly related to this thread's trading method? I know you say to disregard the results because it's an old TE that you are trying to recover, but I assume the trades that you have taken since you started this thread based on your trading method are reflected in your TE?

[quote=Joseph95;10695692]Hello guys, go on daily chart back as you can go,  
  
Hi Joseph. This method is very close to the method i use to correct bad trades..  
  
It isn't as easy as a back test looks especially on the Daily, but a 4 hour bar such as 04-00 UK time it is even better..  
  
Do not let the nay sayers put you down as they probably want spoon feeding and want something for nothing.  
  
i am not here to divulge my method but hopefully you will see yours develop.  
But it is very similar...  
Take care and trade well, you will do it...  
  
  
edit,,, look for stats and try Frequency Distribution as an aid.  
  
edit 2,,, Try outside bar on the daily too , 

SEE LINE,TRADE LINE..PRICE HAS TO GO SOMEWHERE,,, PRICE WILL GO SOMEWHERE.

WOW Sherlock Holmes. and what do you mean?  
i did trade for a living , made a few £££ then got into property.  
When i started coming in FF again( because i do have friends here) i started trading small lots so i could speak about it.  
But then contradicting myself, i am trading full time for my girl friend, when i say full time i mean , i trade the Cable 08-00 bar and then finish for the day.  
easy as they say....  
I now find i feel better in myself by helping others to trade...  
  
Regards, trade well

Hi, the 4 hour bar i speak of is the 04-00 bar UK time.  
If you study this you can then study the 00-00 4 hour bar.  
  
  
edit,,, Those 2 candles/bars are in Asian session, the 00-00 is a good referance bar and the 04-00 is good to trade off when UK opens.  
Study it and you will see what i mean.

I' ve deleted the trade explorer because it's impossible to trade this method with 30 euro. I went to -4 euro then i recovered to 45 euro in 4 days, but trading just discretionally, not with this

I opened this thread in January 2018. Well. Let's see what could be happened if you would taked blindly all the signals till now.  
  
(Little spoiler, i tell you what could be happened: that now you was a better and happier trader)  
  
Note: screenshots taked on another broker  
  
  
I leaved this thread dead intentionally to show all what is the problem of the 95% of losers here:  
  
Lack of patience and discipline.   
  
You MUST make money NOW because you have to run in your 100.000 euro car as soon as you can. This is the problem, that's all.  
  
It's stronger than you: You must trade everyday, you must open positions because you must make money... and when you don't see results, you jump from a thread to another, from a system to another. You can study 2000 books and learn all the videos of Mark Douglas, but if you want make things more complicated for a perverse psychological mechanism... seriously: take in consideration to change work/hobby.  
  
Let's be honest, why is this thread dead? Because the logic behind was too simply. "It's too easy, it can't work"  
  
You was searching for a holy grail, but a complicated one that should meet your ideologies and preconceptions of what is "Trading"  
  
Breaking news: Trading is so simple if you want to make it simple  
  
These are only 9 charts of 28 pairs traded. In these 5 months i earned the 788% trading 20 minutes a day, lol. Are you still searching for the holy grail? Well, take a mirror and you'll find it. Happy life guys  
  
And now who telled me that was "bullsh*it" i want tell you, take the calculator and have fun

Little tip:  
  
Big-E was totally right. You can trade like that searching confluence of factors with Big-E System's on DailyTF.

In the first circle you was still in the trade, and in second circle too.  
  
You just move your SL above/below every new high/low

No EA or you'll fail. Only discretional.  
  
It's important to study PA and techincal analysis and kowing it like your name and address.  
  
Study also the whole Strat's thread.

Yes. You must let the profits run and cut the losses. These are the basics of trading.

Thank you. But i don't think i'll write anymore; I wrote just for saying how the problem is in the behavior, in the approach, in the expectations, prejudices and idealization on how to do trading.  
  
AND  
  
that if you are impatient and don't trust yourself, you'll never be successful.  
  
P.S  
  
I'd like to know if the user that sayed to me that this thread is "bullshit", if he earned over 9000 pips in 5 months

500.000= 4.00  
250.000= 2.00  
100.000= 1.00  
10.000= 0.10  
1000= 0.01  
  
  
Here is what i mean for patience ,in the LONG RUN (MANY YEARS) you will be profitable. With one trade you'll recover all losses with interests, because you have small SL compared to potential TP (infinite)

That's impressive if you made a 768% return while only risking$4 per trade with a $500 acct....

Hello,  
  
Great stuff man. But now will be interesting, how fast it will stop working. Why should it stop. Well if lot of will see the same and do the same, who will do oposite? Banks? Than who will loose if traders wins? Banks will loose? I don't think so. Now we will see how fast markets will react to this things.

On the Forex there is an average exchange of 2000 billions a day. There is nothing a retail trader (or a large group of it) can do for change the things.  
  
Especially if we are talking about CFD.

What are the two moving average lines on your charts and how do they relate to the buy/sell process? I've read the thread several times and couldn't find the values for the moving averages shown.  
  
Also, since you are Italian and presumably speak fluent Italian and I am an American and speak fluent English, is it possible to find someone who speaks fluently in both languages and who will interpret your system rules in such a way as to make it unmistakeably clear in both languages? I've looked at the thread several times now and some folks have tried to explain what is going on, but there is still a lot of uncertainty left for someone like me to misinterpret the rules.  
  
Thankyou for all that you do. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Hi Joseph95,  
Can you please answer one thing, please  
do you close orders on opposite signals?  
Because some times opposite signals can come right after few candles  
  
  
Thanks in advance

What's up guys? glad to see you earning money.  
  
Actually NZD/USD, EUR/USD, USD/JPY and USD/CHF are giving me over 1700 pips. See the quoted post, then open your mt4 ;-)  
  
Remember, always do analysis and don't enter blindly. The quoted post was a provocation to the people who said to me that was "bullsh*t"  
  
More informations you have more edge you have!  
  
Good trading

+572 (now)  
  
Now the important question is...  
  
Would you have the _BALLS _for hold a trade for 6 months, without get scared if the price goes against you 3-6 days eating your precious, hard-earned pips and without playing with your TP and SL?

Hi Joseph,  
Thanks for posting the system.  
~~Where is your TE?~~ Nevermind, saw your post.  
  
I have tried the two indicators that are supposed to find the 'pattern' in this thread but I don't think either of them works as Joseph intended.  
I'd like to forward test this using Laksior's explanations. I can do it manually but a simple indicator that selects engulfing candles with a failed breakout would be helpful. update: Here is an engulfing candle indicator I found ~~that I think is more useful~~. Update: no it's not that good. It misses obvious engulfing candles and doesn't make allowance for long wicks.

Thanks Free84 but that's not the pattern. It generates too many signals, many of which are not engulfing candles.   
Unless I'm mistaken about the necessity of engulfing candles, but then this system simply generates too many signals.

Hello Clemmo. The TE was a old one, which i started trading without any type of knowledge and experience. Now the things are different as you can see.  
  
I' ll try to explain again in a few words and i hope this time all will understand what i'm searching for when i open the MT4.  
  
You have one candle. If the second candle has a shadow that surpass the previous candle low/max, and then close above/below the max/low, you have a signal.  
  
Now this signal MUST be contextualized. Anyway i have demonstrated to the _WHOLE_ forum, that also taking it blindly , in 6 months you was **-plenty- **profitable.  
  
That's all. It's a pattern like others, that i found particularly interesting also because often it warns you of the end of a swing.

Brother,  
It makes complete sense the way you are sharing your trading strategy  
I have one question please  
During the anticipated long trend when a counter candle stick is formed, I mean long wick and close above/below previous candle, would you close that trade or would rather bring the stop loss bit around close to that place?  
  
Thanks in advance

I think it's pretty clear now. I will still wish for a proper indicator, maybe I will make it myself, because although you are quick at finding the patterns because you are used to hunting for them, for those new to this an indicator will speed up detection. I agree that context is important ,and maybe some signals that form at the end of a trend, (detected by a MA cross or an RSI signal or something) should be avoided.

Sorry, i do not trade this system, but have the same in my thread. People are too lazy to make the work self. Test it over a period and you have the result if this work for YOU or not.  
Thats it. 

Market is more simple as you think.

I' ll try to explain again in a few words and i hope this time all will understand what i'm searching for when i open the MT4. You have one candle. If the second candle has a shadow that surpass the previous candle low/max, and then close above/below the max/low, you have a signal. Now this signal MUST be contextualized. Anyway i have demonstrated to the WHOLE forum, that also taking it blindly...

Why dont you just say "engulfing candle"? If its not whats the difference? Or do you just want to take credit for yourself that you said yes and no? Why yes? and why no?

This must have been a good entry for this pair. With this indicator we can clearly see the possible entries, you just have to choose those that are in favor of the trend.

@Joseph95  
  
Thank you very much for sharing this system.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
Unfortunately most people use their time for negative things, rather than contribute to something productive. Keep up the good work, I believe your system works well, since its proven here enough times. One does just have to use proper money management to survive the potential drawdown or SL hit.  
  
I usually prefer scalping and pure price action combined with zones, but I cant always stay the whole day on charts, thats why I want to focus more on swing trading. I want to test your system soon over a period of at least 1 month and document my progress with it. I trade London/NY.  
I read all pages(thx to laksior for pics) in this thread and your explanation is very well and simple, but I have still a few questions if you dont mind to clarify them? thanks in advance.  
  
  
1\. Is it important if the market is in down/uptrend to apply your system or it works in all conditions?  
  
2\. Do you care for major support/resistance Zones and daily/weekly Trendlines?  
  
3\. I know you said dont use any indicator, but you also dont use EMA200 or EMA800 which are on higher TF often respected and often used by swingers? I ask because I see 2 lines on your chart and wonder if they influence your decision.  
  
4\. Obviously some trades take days or weeks, therefore you have to hold through red/orange news. You ignore news or you close trades before red news?  
  
5\. If you hold trades over weekend are you not afraid of gaps?

6\. With "close above highs of previous candle you mean the wick/shadow has to close above previous highs or you mean the body has to close above previous highs?  
  
7\. You set pending orders just above current signal candle high without waiting the next candle close?  
  
  
Sorry for so many questions, I just wanna make sure I get everything right. I would like to contribute with my experience.  
I made a few Screenshots on UJ Daily, would be nice if you could confirm I understand them right.

@Joseph95  
  
  
Picture 1: Bullish Signal, right?  
  
Picture 2: Signal not valid, right?  
  
Picture 3: Bearish Candle doesnt cover 100% of previous candle, trade still valid? Do signal candles have to cover strictly 100% of previous candles or is it ok if they cover just 90%?  
  
And one last question. Whats your experience with this system on H4 candles? You mentioned it works on H4 too, ever used it over a longer period on H4?

Infinite/Discretional. I see you use automated system, If you will automate it you wil loose in the long term, because markets change and there is no EA or automated system that can work forever. I've seen with my eyes EA working for 3-4 years LIVE account and after that period of time total TRASH.

Okay, I never took much notice of the second strategy, I thought we were talking about the engulfing candle.

Hello, I've back tested EUR / USD & USD / JPY & GBP / USD for the past 2 years, each pair got stop loss triggered 1 or 2 times at max, but i used this rule (PUT trailing SL if 15+ Pips in profit). Overall, had around 65 winners, 6-7 breakevens, 4-5 losers.

Hello,  
  
I still don’t see a setup on EURUSD or USDCHF W1 or D1 timeframes, as I understand the second strategy, the only difference from the first is that price closed above or below the previous days open and had not closed above the high or below the low.   
  
Maybe your using a different broke with a different bar opening time, I use GMT + 2..

I do not see it either. I mean I don't see a setup today, yesterday yes.

Sorry I deleted because the signal candle did not close below the open of previous day candle.  
If signal candle closes below previous day open, then this would qualify.  
What I am trying to say is Type 2 does not concern engulfing candle at all (whether is body only or high low)  
  
Type 2:  
1\. Rejection of previous day high.  
2\. Signal candle does not close below previous day low, but closes below previous day open.  
3\. Sell below previous day low.

As I read it, there needs to be an engulfing candle, in post 1, Joseph say's: (if the signal candle has all the prerequisites), maybe he could confirm the type 2 setup.

To clarify the setup 2 in words, you seek for two candlesticks ranging in the almost same price and then,  
  
  
(*sell stop setup*) IF 1. Candle has a rejection from low + IF 2. Candle has a false breakout from high = Open sell stop @ the low.   
  
  
(*buy stop setup*) IF the 1. candle has a false breakout at high and then retraces back + IF 2. Candle has a false rejection from the low and closes above the open price that means you set a buy stop.  
  
Overall, i think Joseph just has a logic of trading the '' high stress '' markets that are looking for a breakout, and to apply strategy to that he uses previous rejections /breakouts.

Hi Joseph  
Not to change anything, but just asking whether you have previous experience looking into Type 1 in the following sell situation (only different in point 1).  
1\. no rejection of previous day high by signal candle but the high is above previous day open.  
2\. Signal candle close below previous day low.  
3\. Sell below signal candle low.  
Thank you.

I suggest to don't lose time searching setups during the day, it could be a doji. Better wait the candle close. I search starting from 23:00 (Italy) when NY close

Keep up the good work, I believe your system works well, since its proven here enough times. One does just have to use proper money management to survive the potential drawdown or SL hit. I usually prefer scalping and pure price action combined with zones, but I cant always stay the whole day on charts, thats why I want to focus more on swing trading. I want to test your system soon...

sometimes it's due to our level of understanding not taking all rules into consideration or our interpretation of it is not complete.  
maybe you like to pinpoint on a chart which two Type 2. I don't seem to find any. we can then discuss so as to improve our/each other understanding.

Nope. If you place the SL above the high (or better, 20 pips above)

I don't want to read anymore i'm cherrypicking: the signals of the last months are visible to the whole world, and these trades are running all in profit; and i suggest you to focus on the candles, no indicators and EA, or you will never fully understand... train the eye and the brain, get a general view of the market, of what is doing

EUR/CAD last months. Camon. Tell me i am cherry picking. Are you in this trade? No. Because you have fear to lose money and you don't trust yourself, of what you see. Here is the problem.  
  
The yellow circles are the signals. You can see other dynamics like trendlines, flags, head and shoulders, hump, Elliot's waves. If you can't see all these things you'll never be profitable with this """"system""", also with the best indicator of the world

" **Obviously the signals must be contextualized. More things you know, more informations you have and greater the edge "**  
  
If nobody can't understand this, i suggest you to change hobby guys, for your own health and life. Go play the roulette, trust me.  
  
You can't pretend to earn money -only- with 2 candles. My post of taking blindly the signals was just a provocation, don't take it too serious...  
  
I'm not saying this for do the "great Trader" or for discourage you.  
  
Traders, basically, make decisions.  
  
They make decisions based on the informations that they can collect, and depending on what information tells, they do the trade .  
Traders can collect various type of informations from various types of analysis: Wave analysis, cyclic, fundamental, volumetric, technical, mathematical (algos) etc.  
  
I showed a thing that tells you something (the rejection and the CLOSE above/below certain areas) which is often snubbed, but if this is taked in the right context, it is a great signal.

Well, it's not like x crosses y, you put your sl at 50-100 pips w/e and then hop for 50-150+ pips systems,  
You can lose 3 in a row,( whichs not even posibble according to my daily backtests). But once you pick the right direction, it'll cover up 10+ Loses. Even with a low win rate, i see this working. Although, the win rate is suprisingly high.  
Thanks again for sharing your idea joseph.   
  
AUD/JPY last buy setup +40 Pips and running, worst scenario just BE it, be creative. And hold your winning ones, huge potentional to grow on daily chart before the market turns against you, especially when you pick a bottom or top.  
  
+Last EUR / USD swing looks like made over 800 pips, at this point it's better to discuss how to hold winning ones, because that 800 pips means covering up almost 10-15 loses according to the stop loss rules, and i found only 4 losing positions on EUR/USD for the last 2 years on the daily chart.

Very good job Asw. I think a dashboard it’s more useful because you have eyes everywhere, instead of arrows. Very good again, thank you  
  
  
P.S please, someone who has understood good the rules can explain it to Asw so he can improve the dashboard?

@Joseph  
  
like I said I want to contribute. The reason why I was asking for confirmation was because your english isnt perfect(neither is mine) so sometimes details get lost in translation, eventhough you gave alot of clear screenshots. I'm not lazy, I've read every page, especially the first 2 several times, but still can happen that I overlook important information. I want to do a solid backtest, therefore I want to be sure.  
Anyway I appreciate and I think this entry method has a good potential.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
I didnt had much time for testing, but from what I can say until now it is not even needed to cut out the losing trades, just if we could have a signal to get out soon enough. Some trades are 30-40 pips in profit before hitting SL. If we could catch that with a method besides trailing stop, this would make this method even more effective. I dont have an answer for this now, but maybe someone has. I have good experience with trendlines on higher timeframes, maybe they can filter out a few bad trades when price is close to a major trendline. Of course you cant only rely on it, but lets see what we can ad.  
  
And I do agree with you that the risk reward ratio is more than enough. Even if you lose 3 trades in a row, which I didnt had until yet, there are stil alot pips coming. You just have to be patient and hold the trades long enough.  
As for the money management I would simply adjust the lotsize to the SL so that when SL gets hit I lose max. 1-2%, thats it. Once you know your lotsize you can split your positions in as many parts as needed. Thats how I would do it.  
  
I tested your method today and I was watching only for the Type1 signal. I think I got everything right except that sometimes the rejection shadow of the signal candle is not bigger than the previous one. And the signal candle didnt always closed about previous day high, but its just a quick try.  
Its late evening here(europe) and after a long day I tried to spot few entries so nevermind if I missed some trades.  
Tell me what you think about it.  
  
  
These were spotted on Tradingview, (first 2 pics)EURJPY, (thrid pic) USDJPY, Daily, black box is winning trade, blue box shows pips, red box losing trade  
  
I always choose the max. pip count and I know its not realistic to catch 100% of the move, but its just a quick try to see whats possible. Exit points are after TP1 individual anyway....  
  
**Edit:** Ignore 2 of 3 losing trades(red boxes), these were not valid setups, sorry.

Sorry if I appeared aggressive. Before taking a trade, get a general view of what is happening and think about your next move; don’t look only the pattern

Dashboard type 1 works all great, i'll keep an eye for the type 2 if it occurs.  
  
In addition, i'm making an in-depth backtest for stop loss / takeprofit potentioals  
  
How will it be done?  
  
1) I use the stop loss rule of joseph for each trade, SL at HH / LL of signal candle  
  
2) Trying to identify the best posibble scenario to take profits,  
I'm doing by this monitoring the daily entries on 4 HR Chart, checking it if retraces back to where position is placed or not, is it a good idea to have a trail stop loss or not,  
  
SO FAR, taking the loses at normal stop loss & letting the winners let run looks like the best option, why? Well, the winning ones run for 110-500+ Pips, i'm assuming a good math of 2 positions sized with %66-%33 portion (%66 is taken after 100+pips profit, and letting the %33 run for 200+ would be a nice approach) In fact, all of the entries have a tendency to really run for 100+ pips, 200+ and 500+. Yes it is posibble!  
  
About SL ; Since the entry accurracy is quite high, and stop loss is some sort of tight ( usually 60-100 pips) i think it's a nice strategy to not use any trail stop loss or any kind, and just let the position run.  
  
I'll completly simulate this on few pairs for the past year, and share the results with you here.  
  
Best Regards.

The signal candle must have always a longer shadow compared to the previous day/week/month; if it doesn’t have longer shadow, simply it isn’t a valid setup

Are we talking about Type 2 or Type 1 ?  
  
Which shadow? also, top or bottom, can you give me an example, please.

The method used ;  
  
1 ) After the trade is taken, SL is placed and left untouched. ( Which is signal candle High / Low )  
2 ) Type '' 1 '' Setups are traded, Type 2's are really rare or either i wasnt able to notice them.  
3 ) Backtests contain 1 year range, on the daily chart.  
  
Insights :  
If the entry is accurate, it literally runs for 100+ pips profit according to the backtests.  
  
Suggestions about SL: No point to use stop loss higher than 100 pips, some shadows on the signal candles can be really huge, in fact it doesnt retrace back after a 100 pip. Hence, i'd suggest using a FIX SL of 100 pips on the signal candles which are normally higher than 100+ pips. If it's not >100, use the regular High / Low SL. ( Can be 60-70-80 w/e).  
  
Suggestions about TP: Since we run for a 100+ pip run everytime we are accurate, I'd say it's a good option to get in with 2 positions, 2.00 Lot's to take profit at 100 pips, and another 1.00 position running for 150 - 1000 pips, ( Do your own profit taking technique just in this case).

Hi AWS. Thanks for the dashboard. Very helpful. Does the Rejection_Dashboard_v1.0t2 identify both Type 1 and Type 2 or just Type 2?

I don’t know anymore how to explain it. This is the last time, seriously, there are 20+ examples.  
  
Type 1 (Bullish)  
  
We have 2 candles.  
  
One Red and one Green.  
If the green has a downLONGER shadow compared to the previous candle low  
  
and then  
  
CLOSE **_above_ **the previous candle high, we have a type 1 signal  
  
Type 2 (always bullish)   
  
We have two candles. One red and one green.  
If the green has a downLONGER shadow compared to the previous candle low and DOESN’T CLOSE ABOVE THE PREVIOUS DAY HIGH BUT close ABOVE THE OPEN -because is red isn’t it?- (If the previous candle was green, that was the CLOSE) here we have type 2 signal

hi joseph. if you don't mind and don't take my suggestion or request wrong then why don't you give a signal for some day just 1 or 2 signals with currencies i.e. previous two candles were this, this so now candle will be this this?  
so that we can also guess it very well and understand with perfection...  
Thank you very much...

Here are 2 indicators, so you can visually backtest.  
  
Target TP is setup at 0.786% of the average daily range, you can change this setting to what ever you require.

If you go on UJ D1 chart you will find several setups from the last 1-2 months. Its current data, not 3 years old or something. You can also watch this post for explanation...

I agree. I had similar ideas. Reducing the SL will bring alot. Either a fix one or we say SL at 80% of the candle for example. But to figure out whats the best SL, we would need to see more losing trades.  
With tighter SL the lotsize and so the profit will increase.

Hello Joseph,  
  
I've been though the thread and checked out your examples on the images you have posted.  
On a lot of there are no opposite candle before the signal bar(Bearish before a Bullish and Bullish before a Bearish).  
  
The dashboard is coded to have an opposite bar before the signal bar, is that correct or can there be a bullish bar before a bullish bar and a bearish bar before a bearish signal bar??  
  
I'm not a dumb s-it, just like things to be right.  
  
Asw

Hi Joseph, just one question. For a BUY signal, is it absolutely important for the previous candle to be a bearish candle, or it's ok for it to be a bullish candle as long as the signal candle fully engulfs it? Basically, must the two candles be opposing candles?  
\---  
**Edit** : Just noticed after posting that ASW has the exact same concerns as I am. Once you answer him, I would've gotten my answer.

Just flipping through my charts and observing what may look like a valid setup on done pairs. Still about 30mins to candle close on my broker, though.   
\---  
EURJPY D1 - Type 2 setup (SELL).   
EURNZD W1 - Type 2 setup (SELL).   
NZDJPY W1 - Type 2 setup (BUY).   
EURCHF W1 - Type 2 setup (SELL).   
EURUSD W1 - Type 2 setup (SELL)   
\---  
Kindly note that the EURUSD & EURCHF setups still have unresolved issues as previous candle is same direction with signal candle.   
\---  
BTW, EUR weakness seems to be the central theme from those setups.

Thank you Joseph for sharing his trading method. I try to make it an indicator as shown below. The blue and red bars in the separate windows are bull and bear when the conditions for Type 1 / Type 2 are all met. Please note that I modify some other volume indicator so as to get this indicator promptly. So the indicators are nothing to do with Volume.  
  
See whether the signals are correct. (Some of the signals might not have shadow significantly longer than the previous candlestick)

Hi Asw,  
  
And if you are going to include setups where the the previous candle and the signal candle are of the same colour please upgrade the "Rejection Dashboard" indicator as well to include the additional setups (candles of the same colour)

Why do U search turning points in a trend? U should continuation to search... turning points are at support and res levels. also technical zone + candle formation together says the reversal or breakout. but this is my opinion

Thank you so much.  
Please take a look at Type 2 Signal Candle under _any bar_.  
The direction of trade to be taken should be according to the signal candle colour. Buy colour should be green and long shadow _below_. Sell colour should be red and long shadow _above_.  
  
At the moment the dashboard appears as follow.

The signal would be before the last bar and that is the result of the signal.  
  
The signal is correct, forget the last bar. the signal is 1 and 2 bars back.

Hi Asw, really appreciate you taking time out to code the indicators. However, just taking a look at the last chart you posted (with indicator arrows), I can observe that you need an extra condition in your logic (code).  
\---  
For a sell signal, the signal candle MUST be bearish and vice versa. I can see sell arrows even when the signal candle was bullish. The CHFJPY H4 chart, you posted, I don't think that's a valid sell signal. It would only be a valid setup if the previous candle was bearish, therefore closing below open (for bullish bar) or close (for bearish bar).  
\---  
Just my thoughts, though. I don't know if I'm correct. I hope Joseph will come and clarify when he has the time.  
\---  
BTW, I did request for the mq4 file of the indicators (if you don't mind). I would love to play with some filters to see how the results would be.  
\---  
**EDIT** : Could you add a user adjustable setting to chose which candle the signal appears? I usually prefer prefer SHIFT 1, where the arrow shows on the signal (previous candle).

my queries are in accordance to the 2nd last bar as signal candle. we are on the same page.  
in the case of chfjpy h4, the dashboard gave a sell signal. I expect a _red_ candle for _sell_ instead of a green one.  
in the case of eurgbp w1, the dashboard gave a buy signal. I expect _green_ candle for _buy_ instead of a red one.  
  
hmnnn…… this is indeed unique as I can't find one from Joseph's previous examples.  
I guess will have to leave it to Joseph for clarification.

> {quote} Hi Asw, really appreciate you taking time out to code the indicators. However, just taking a look at the last chart you posted (with indicator arrows), I can observe that you need an extra condition in your logic (code). --- For a sell signal, the signal candle MUST be bearish and vice versa. I can see sell arrows even when the signal candle was bullish. The CHFJPY H4 chart, you posted, I don't think that's a valid sell signal. It would only be a valid setup if the previous candle was bearish, therefore closing below open (for bullish bar)...

The Indicators coded to Joseph's spec, as I understand it, however, you are quite right, the signal in that case is not good, I'll add code to make it bearish or bullish.  
With reference to the mq4 file , I don't share my code.  
  
The signal arrives when it does, can't choose which bar it arrives on.

Oh Well Mr.Inthebox: You are not in a box really a very nice description about the signals clearly understood.  
Could you please tell me one thing is it mandatory or important that current candle should must reject a previous day's high or low for sell or buy signal and should make a clear high or low signal more than previous candle and it should also close higher or lower than previous candle's close and open. i hope you are understanding high/low,close/open because i am asking for both cases. sell and buy.  
in simple in a buy signal is it important that current day candle should go down to make a clear shadow or some down from previous day's low and then close higher than open or high?  
Hope understood my question.

I would like to request MR. Joseph here to please put some live signals here being senior and export member and owner of the thread because whatever he knows and has experience regarding this strategy no body else can have. So Plz Mr.Joseph if you share signals because if you doing trading then you must have candles and currencies infront of your eyes which are clerly giving sings.  
If you don't think that you should share your personal indications then currency pairs can be share which are making candles according to strategy.  
Thank you very much...

Yes, it was a valid sell signal, except that the previous candle was a Sunday candle. I, personally, use a broker with no Sunday candles (NY close).

A non trading day and you were up at 3 am LOL. The name is to remind myself one has to look inside himself first to find answers, before looking out of the box.  
For me personally, it is not mandatory but important depending on situations and your own experience.  
For example, during ranging times, price likes to go below yesterday's low to take out stops to get in at a better price before resuming its up direction.  
In a running up trend with momentum, price may not even go anywhere near or below yesterday's low.  
Yesterday's high low and today's open are places where fierce battles are fought.  
Generally go with the advice buy higher high, higher low. Applies to open as well.

eur/chf if it closes above 1.1741 or below the previous candle, will be a signal candles. Sell is appropriate.

It's not a valid signal until the bar has closed and the PO should be below the low of the previous bar.

Thank you Mr.Asw. i was just asking about the thing. it will be valid if it closes tonight under the last candle and tomorrow breaks today's candle to down side. should sell stop at the end/down of today's candle if order hits it's a valid signal.  
Thanks again...

Mr.Remon my advise is to wait till tomorrow if today's candle breaks down previous candle and closes under previous low then put pending order on bottom price of today's candle if tomorrow it breaks down today's candle then it's safe signal as per Mr.Joseph's strategy. Other wise it's risky might it can go down from here but not sure...

Look at this pair. It's also going to the directions. but it's not valid until candle does not close yesterday's low and tomorrow if it does not break down today's lower low.  
i hope you understand...  
Thank you.

i don't believe in H4 for this strategy because today on H4 i saw some of the pairs were not going positive. Pairs were hitting stop loss on H4. it works very well with D1 and W1

Will take a while to look for any reason not to take a signal, as there are plenty of signals.. Perfect set up in the USDX today short H4.  
I would note that weekly S/R should be taken into account as this can create advrse conditions on a bounce. (no matter what time frame this is being used on..)  
Nice share, will take a second read through...

Thought provoking questions. Since no one is answering yet, let me attempt to. This is my personal view on hindsight.  
  
This was a ranging area and later the trend was reversed upward. So losing money here is normal.  
It should be alright if one is still making money on a monthly basis. Just like any other systems, test over a period of time to see whether it suits your temperament.  
  
1\. Type 2 setup, place pending buy order above candle 1. Candle 1 can be of same colour as signal candle.  
2\. Pending buy order placed 1 pip above candle 1 high.  
3\. Assuming buy order above was triggered, one could exit trade upon seeing opposite signal candle. Then go to look for other pairs.  
The opposite signal candle would also negate above pending buy order if it was not triggered.  
4\. Pending sell order triggered.  
5\. Loss accepted.  
6\. Pending buy order remains as long as there is no opposite signal candle or candle that closes below signal candle low.

Inthebox you are loosing your time. Don't explain it anymore please; i have explained it 10 times with 20 screenshots and i see people still struggling.  
  
You'll don't see me here because i asked to leave indicators and EA and now i see all concentrating on arrows and dashboards, and people still asking for explanations... so sadly. These people will never learn trading if they can't understand the logic behind 2 candles... how they can get a general view of the market ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f622.png?v=15.1)  
  
Meanwhile i see 2-3 traders making money. I'm happy for them.

Thanks Mr. Joseph for sharing this trading strategy... i will say I’m the ‘biggest gainer’ here, because i have made well over 800pips (and over 900pips floating profits) since the 8th of may. (When I started using this strategy)  
  
i have been trading for well over a year now, but this is the ‘simplest and most profitable’ strategy so far for me. Thanks again.

Well done my friend! I am very happy to know I helped someone!  
  
Keep on going and never stop to study ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f4d6.png?v=15.1) be patient ,trust yourself and let the profits run; you should forgive your trades once you’re in. Sit on your hands.  
  
Don’t get unconfident if you take 1,2,3,4 SL in a row or just one big SL, because if you will always searching for the opportunity you will find it and you will recover all with interest

This is not a valid entry. Trade taken before candle close. While we are at it I have to remind everyone about a big confusion that comes a cross in every tread. Unless we all use the same broker time we are not talking the same language. Broker time differs thus we are often end up different candle close. So either we all syncronize it or be careful about it. Noobs usually confused with all this and end up loosing faith or try all this with wrong format.  
  
My advise to ppl here to use brokers with GMT+3 as the candle close with US market close. And for god sake wait for the candle close.  
  
Another suggestion is: even setup is clear and you take the trade since we are trading on daily candle be careful with up coming news about the pair. If there are important news just pull yourself to BE before news. That way you can always protect your capital and there is always another trading day.  
  
And one last thing stay away from ranging pairs like EURCHF and very volatile pairs like GBPNZD. I am not saying you cannot make money on these pairs but why to risk more when there is plenty of others to trade.  
  
Regards to you all....

Joseph I cannot appriciate more what you are doing for fellow traders. That is what I call dedication and good heart. But we are not all equally created what many understand in minutes some may take longer. You already showed something of yours with such a nice intention but since you waste your valuable time for us why dont you take it a step ahead and give few setups as it occurs. Not only you of course anyone of us who got it right could give that picture. But please be there for us so we would know we are on the right track. Yes time consuming and you might get bored or feel silly but since you start this tread let it be more effective. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

I've got to give credit where credit is due and I am encouraged by what I'm seeing. Granted, I just started applying Joseph's instructions as of May 18th. There is a lot more testing to do to "make it my own" but we are on the right track. Although the method is simple, I also like to use tools that make my life easier. So I have to give a shout out to ASW for the Dashboard and indicators. Joseph may not approve and he is right that they aren't really needed but I love the dashboard and I also confirm everything with the chart itself.  
  
Now to the results. Below is my active TradeExplorer where I will be applying this method to a demo account. It is where I go to prove things. You can ignore everything prior to May 18th as those were other methods. Also the three trades with very short durations as they were mistakes. That leaves five trades - 2 closed and 3 open. My broker is GMT +3 so the day starts on the NY 5pm close. Right now, I'm only trading the Daily timeframe.  
  
Feel free to check that the setups are correct. My entries may be a little early on a few of them because of my schedule but those are calculated risks. It use 1-2% risk on every trade but no more than that so the size depends on the entry and distance to the stop loss.  
  
Let's see how this goes.

EURJPY had a nice short setup... moving nicely.

Hi prof8t. which timeframe are you referring to? On the Daily, using the NY close as the start of a new day, I saw the setup on 5/18 and entered 5/21 which was premature as price did not break the low of the 5/18 close. As you can see from my trade results, I paid for it too. But as of the start of today's candle, I don't see a valid setup on the EJ on the Daily. Are your charts showing something different?

So, like that, we have 3 scenarios: - Both positions will hit your SL (that is tight compared to the POTENTIAL/infinite TP) -1 will hit tp, 1 SL= 0 loss and 0 gain -One will hit tp and one will run= Thousands of pips who will recover all your losses with interest.

Thanks you Joseph for sharing your trade set up. I'm very appreciate that. I've just registered Forexfactory for ask some questions. I understand 2 types of your setup and SL but TP is problem for me. You said open order 2 order, First order TP at RR:1:1 SL and second order "Let's Profit run". I don't know when I should exit second order. Do you have rules for exit that and How to exit.

Nice trades! Would you mind going over your trailing with the GJ short trade of April 27th? That pair pulled back some 210 pips, making a LH which was broken on the 17th of May by another 70 pips before going down again, and you 're still in! Congrats!  
Looks like Ralffe's "trendline" system by the way.  
  
Edit: same thing for the EJ short on May 1st.

EagleEye, ok. But i don't speak Aztec and the pattern isn't discretional. Not my problem if someone can't understand 2 basic patterns with some variables

Why do people who think it doesnt work, just show a chart with 10 setups and we count the wins and losses? Pretty simple, why people judge before they test it themselves?  
I've tested it so far on 4 pairs and it works beautifully. And I just tested the Daily and Type 1. I'm still working on make the SL tighter, but even without it RR is more than enough.  
  
@Joseph  
  
I have this question, I didnt find an answer for it.  
**Example:** You have Type 1 Bearish Signal, you enter the trade and after some time another Bearish Type 1 Signal appears, do you re-enter or just Ignore it and stay even longer in the trade? You said you dont like to add to a position so I guess you just stay in.

Yes Eagle-Eye , IF it close above the previous close it is TYPE 2 setup. If it draws a higher high and still close above the previous close it is TYPE 1 setup . I hope you are not confused ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1).

Again. You think in black and white. You must be flexible! Anyway, try it! Expect huge drawdowns if you trade the weekly! I personally don't like very very much this trade, because price is ranging inside a weekly candle  
  
This system isn't for you if you aren't flexible; you aren't obliged to take all the signals. This is strictly discretional, so i can't "clarify"definitively  
  
Discretional trading has not rules sculpted in the rock...  
  
If someone can't understand it, change system or you' ll lose.

This is up to you. You can add positions if you want... it depends from your risk propensity  
  
One idea could be:  
  
I have a signal on the weekly. My main focus will be on the weekly, but if i want add positions i'll search on daily TF

Unless we all use the same broker time we are not talking the same language. Broker time differs thus we are often end up different candle close. So either we all syncronize it or be careful about it. Noobs usually confused with all this and end up loosing faith or try all this with wrong format. My advise to ppl here to use brokers with GMT+3 as the candle close with US market...

I wouldn’t stress too much about having the same broker IMO. There will be setups on your platform that other people miss due to having a different broker to you. It will work out evenly.  
  
I reckon if you operate on GMT + 0 it should be okay but tell me if I’m wrong. London session has the most volume traded through so if your platform is close to GMT/BST then it will

Hopefully it's OK to mention that Fx Choice has the New York close candles (I am in no way affiliated with them, just use for demo account). I do think the Sunday candles are messing you up. 

Wow! I've got some experience to gain.

Joseph, thank you for your insight, I too have been making $ with this simple strategy since the beginning of the month. It is fun to see my little account start to gain. And yes, there are losses. I am remaining cautiously optimistic that the growth will continue. 

Wow! I've got some experience to gain.

No trigger. Just download the demo as mentioned and do the comparison.

You cannot change server time. However there are quite a lot of broker working with GMT +3 . Just get a demo and watch it . If u have the set up then place your order in your oeiginal broker. Alternatively charting platform tradingview operates with ny close you can also follow it there and place your order whereever your account is.

I know this is supposed to be used only on daily, weekly and monthly, but I still tried it on M5 and it works pretty well if you want to scalp or scalp to swing.  
I used tradingview. All trades are from today until back approx. 1-2 weeks. No cherry picking. I didnt followed any  
indicators or pay attention to trend, market structure, price action, news etc. so theres room for improvement. I just tried to find valid Type1 setups.

Keep in mind that I always used the almost best possible exit. I know its not realistic, but this just shows whats possible if you let few positions run. TP1 RR1:1 was hit anyway most of the time. Its up to the trader what to make out of the rest. Like I said with keeping attention to price action theres much possible, but even trading this entry method blind its still profitbale for now. I know that 20 trades per pair are not much and I will keep on testing, but the results looking good for now.

I am telling everyone again. Technical analysis all good we use them but they are not powerful alone you need to watchout for news as well. If there is a crude oil inventory news soon stay out of CAD pairs wait till news settle down. Dont follow technicals blindly. It may turn out positive to you but why to risk it. There is plenty of pairs and there is trade everyday. Our goal is to ride the waves not guess where the wave starts. Keep an eye on the news as well as your technicals and you dont have to wonder why it didnt work out.  
  
It is very likely that CADCHF resumes its move to higher but that has nothing to do with this setups.

Looks like some new opportunities on the Daily will (..."may") be setting up at 5 pm today.  
  
EURCAD  
EURAUD  
EURGBP  
(EURNZD possibly)  
GBPAUD  
GBPCAD  
(GBPNZD possibly)  
  
There are some other type 2's but they look questionable. Also keep in mind it is not a signal candle until the new day starts. Trade smart and realize that some of these pairs are highly correlated. Factor that into your risk. And...some are already in "inflection zones" on the H4 and are showing divergence on a number of indicators. For me, that means that I should keep in mind where the initial move started, where it is now, and to keep my stops tight.  
  
The EURGBP is ambivalent but helps a little in determining which is better for me, the GBPCAD or the EURCAD. I'm going to go with the GBPCAD and see what happens.

Those are nice results David7. Thanks for sharing them with us. I was planning to get to the M5 at some point and your post confirmed my expectation.  
  
Which sessions were you trading and what hours. That usually makes a difference when trading the M5. If you decide to post your general trading windows, please specify which time zone you used or post them in GMT-0 so people don't get confused. Thanks for considering.

You're welcome.  
My timezone is UTC+2, I'm from Europe. I get confused with timezones, so I'm not sure if it helps you out. I used tradingview which also shows me UTC+2. I think UTC+2 is the same like GMT+2? Correct me if Im wrong.  
  
I didnt take the trades on demo account, I searched for the setups and meassured the pips. I would've taken these setups if I were on demo, but unfortunately at the moment I have not much time for trading. I found these setups across all times and sessions. Ny, London, Asia, which speaks even more for the entry method. I usually trade only London/NY.  
  
Someone else here mentioned it works on M10 too.  
I tried M15 and H4 and the results were not good at least on the first sight, maybe needs more backtesting before I can judge it.

Great. Keep on going. I recommend d1/w1/mn but if you prove you can earn money also on m5... good for you my friend. I hope my thread helped you.  
  
A dashboard for m5 with alerts could be useful, in your case  
  
Continue to post ideas and backtests guys, let’s build something together

Hambone,  
As for dashboard user how do you take weekly and monthly signals. Because the candles not yet been closed for the week or month so do you wait till it closes or you take it as it comes?

Hi Kxeroo. So far, I haven't taken any of the Weekly or Monthly trades as I prefer to trade the Daily. But, if i were to trade them, I would wait until the end of the week (Friday 5 pm NY) or the end of the month to close before I placed the trade.  
  
But I would ask that Joseph95 give his insight since he devised this method. He may have a different perspective/suggestion.

Hi dkarev. I didn't change any settings. I first set the timeframe to Daily then applied the template that Asw provided. After the template, I loaded the type 1 and type 2 indicators separately. I'm still using the ones that handled the types separately and not combined into one dashboard. I haven't tried that one yet.

> Looks like some new opportunities on the Daily will (..."may") be setting up at 5 pm today....some are already in "inflection zones" on the H4 and are showing divergence on a number of indicators. For me, that means that I should keep in mind where the initial move started, where it is now, and to keep my stops tight. The EURGBP is ambivalent but helps a little in determining which is better for me, the GBPCAD or the EURCAD. I'm going to go with the GBPCAD and see what happens.

The GBPCAD trade just got stopped out. It happens right. We knew we were in an inflection zone already and the move that began at 1.8415 may be exhausted...we'll see.

Hambone, why did it get stopped out? According to the trading system, you needed to place sell stop below the signal bar. If the order had been placed correctly, it wouldn't have even been activated

i really appreciate your response to inquiry please help with the link to the template and the indicator you used, i believe the indicator i downloaded is the combine one...if you have the link where the indicator and template are please help me with it.

You make a good point NewLiberty. On my broker, the signal candle low was 1.7115. The Entry candle low was 1.7107 ... 8 pips below the previous candle close. So it would have been activated. I entered a little higher at 1.7123 simply because I wanted to be in the trade.

Setups per the dashboard as of 5 pm NY close.  
  
Not sure I would take the GBPCAD D1 as there is no wick/shadow. Not sure if that makes a difference to others though.

Sure. If you look at the top right corner of any thread, you will see a paperclip icon with a number next to it. For this thread, you should see the paperclip with "151" to the right of it (that's the number right now...it could change anytime some adds another attachment). Click the paperclip and you will see all attachments that have been posted to the thread in one place.  
  
The template and dashboard I use are the ones from Asw on May 18. There are some dated later but those are the ones that work for me. Let me know once you find them or if you need further assistance.

The EJ weekly looks valid if you are allowing bear/bear candle combinations and Type 2. I believe Joseph's original model was candles of different colors (bull/bear, bear/bull). I'll have to defer to him. What pair is the second chart?

This is EA for this Strategy.  
Change StopLoss,TakeProfit as you want.  
(Don't make SL and TP too tight.If do so,the order fails.)  
  
If SL and TP is both 0,SL and TP becomes a last bar's bar-Length.

Hi John0415. Thank you for your effort to code an EA and to share it with the community. Personally, I like using tools and automation that could potentially help me. That said, may I offer a suggestion? Since Joseph95 started this thread and expressed his desire to not have any EAs posted, maybe you would consider starting another thread of your own and post your EA there. That would allow those who wanted to test your EA and provide feedback to do so without muddling up Joseph's thread with all of the back and forth that accompanies testing, debugging, etc. an EA. This would keep this thread brief and effective and prevent it from becoming so overburdened and lengthy as so many other threads have become.  
  
I have put your EA through the first battery of tests and have some feedback since it doesn't appear to take the trades correctly. I'll await your response on starting another thread and post my test results/comments there. Thanks for considering.

Oh,I didn't know about posting EA in this thread.  
I respect that and I've stoped uploading my EA.  
As for new thread,I have no such intention.

Till now i have studied it on m5. It works and there are a lot of signals.  
  
A dashboard working only for spot M5 signals (both type 1 and 2, or if you want more chances only type 1) could be very useful, because m5 it's a very fast TF, and without it we could miss some good signal. For D1 W1 and MN tf it's useless IMHO

> Keep in mind that I always used the almost best possible exit. I know its not realistic, but this just shows whats possible if you let few positions run. TP1 RR1:1 was hit anyway most of the time. Its up to the trader what to make out of the rest. Like I said with keeping attention to price action theres much possible, but even trading this entry method blind its still profitbale for now. I know that 20 trades per pair are not much and I will keep on testing, but the results looking good for now.

Great stuff, mate. From the average win-rate (+75%) you posted, I think a 1:1 ratio is already good enough. Anything higher will just be a cherry on the cake. One might consider splitting his positions in 2. First position exits at 1:1, while the other continues to run until the next key S/R level.

Dear Joseph95, based the given definition I think in these all 3 screen shots there is No setup at all, Am I correct.  
  
in 1st and 2nd screen shot, the 2nd candle did not cross the Open of the 1st candle  
  
and in 3rd screen shot both candle are of same color + The 2nd candle did not cross the Open of the 1st candle,  
Hence there is NO SETUP.  
  
Is my interpretation correct ?

There are a number of indicators that attempt to plot S/R levels, however, I don't use them. I prefer to draw the levels myself.   
\---  
So, here's how I personally go about them. I focus mainly on the D1 TF for my S/R levels, but occasionally I also plot H4 and W1 levels, depending how strong the trend is. I usually change my D1 charts from candlestick to line graph. This helps me to see the turning points better. I then place horizontal lines at the tip of the turning points to mark my S/R levels. I try not to pick every turning point but only the ones that resulted in some significant moves. After that, I flip back to candlestick charts and then watch PA around those S/R levels.

You're welcome prof8t. Does your broker use a prefix or suffix on the currency? If so, you need to add it to the inputs. For example, my broker lists the pairs as EURUSDi. Notice the "i" at the end. I had to add it to the pairSuffix on the inputs. Only then would the indicator list the pairs.

Not constantly due to time reasons. Just had not enough time to test it everyday.  
I do have took spontaneously a few trades on M5 GJ on my Live account and they were positive. 6W, 1L.  
What I noticed on M5 is that most of the time the trades become profitable when the signal candle is small - mid sized. On huge signal candles there were more losses. Cant tell now how to define "huge" candles, when I'm going to test it properly I will meassure the pipsize of those candles. This is probably an area where improvements can be made and mistakes can be sorted out.  
  
I hope you guys and joseph keep making progress. I dont like to make judgements before I havent test it long enough, but so far like said before it works good on M5.  
It didnt work on M15, H1, H4 for me.  
  
I would like to take trades constantly everyday for a month on one pair to have a reliable result. Since markets behave different on week 1 than on week 4.  
Problem is at the moment I have not enough time to trade, but I will do it soon and share my results.  
  
If you guys can confirm the system on any timeframe feel free to share. The more people test it the easier it gets to filter out the right pairs and timeframes. I had the best results so far on daily and M5.

i think i understand what u mean by the candle too long enough, all pattern /indicators wont work. mostly during high impact news, right?

Hi francis,  
  
I'm not sure what exactly you mean, but I didnt used this entry method on M5 during orange & red news.  
I traded GBP pairs during London until NY close and rest of pairs when NY open until close.  
  
For using daily candles it worked also during orange&red news, but I prefer to close my trades before news eventhough with daily candles it requires time to hold the trades, therefore its not always avoidable news to cross your trades. But the higher the timeframe the less impact it has on your trade. The most comfortable entry method was for me the daily. If you want quick scalps then M5.  
  
btw I was always using Type1 signals only. I still didnt try weekly candles.

I have been back testing this strategy extensively for the last week or so using a programmed strategy for JForex. I have tried 5 min, 60 min, 4 hour and daily charts on GBP/USD and EUR/USD and cannot find anyway to make it consistently profitable with Type 1 trades or even with the addition of Type 2 trades (they seem to make the outcome worse). One year might be profitable and the next few years are losses - break even at best not including commissions i.e. net losses. I had some hope for this since it looked pretty good on the surface. Perhaps there could be filters applied or avoiding news days - not sure, but overall I couldn't find long term success with this strategy. I tried trailing stops, break even levels, only trading in certain sessions, scalping, various stop losses and RR - nothing is consistent with this :-(

Thanks for the report TheSpoof. I tested extensively too with my EA and received similar results. I've done every standard time frame from M1 to Monthly. I use tick level data from TDS and I've done it with and without incorporating variable spread, slippage, and transaction costs. I've combined it with a variety of types of filters from RSI, CCI, Stochastic, and even some proprietary ones in an effort to cherry pick entries. I've tried many types of trade management such as those you mentioned above....Not a single strategy was profitable or sustainable using any of my automated approaches.   
  
That said, it was never intended to be automated per Joseph95 but I prefer to trade with automated tools. So I wanted to look at it anyway. At this point, it doesn't look like that is going to work.  
  
The trades that I have selected manually have worked out so far but I'm very selective. That's was the original approach Joseph suggested.

Hey Hambone,  
So what criteria are you using to be selective with the trades you take? The back testing has certainly shown that the candle pattern alone does not give us any sort of edge at all. I was hoping to even use it as confirmation of momentum to scalp some quick pips off the daily chart. I tested a 15 pip TP with a 30 pip SL (or SL at the signal candle as suggested) and it did very well in 2017 to now (quadrupled the account) but failed if tested from 2015 forwards so I didn't bother going back further. Maybe the pattern occurring at S&R? I think there are likely more reliable reversal patterns though.

Yes of course you have to watch price action. It definitely helps to use major and minor S&R zones. The most reliable majors for me are H4. Minors on M15, M30. If you pay attention to market structure and price action you can use this entry method with type 1 candles on M5 and be profitable. I dont know why it didnt worked for you, but maybe you give it a try again on different pairs?  
I'm naturally a scalper, maybe thats why its easier to make it work for me.  
GU is btw not a good pair to scalp due to its movement. Breakouts on GU are great, but on M5 i wouldnt scalp it. UJ is the most easy and save to scalp. G pairs give the quickest results but also spike hard in one candle. EU and EJ are also good to scalp.  
  
btw can you tell us how many trades you took approx? This is an important information and helps to classify the results.  
  
For daily candles when you draw major zones + pay attention to fundamentals and use fib on monthly, you will have all the information you need.  
I cant wait to test it for at least a month straight, then I will see if it gives constantly good results.

When it comes to winning systems, yes, I think a highly experienced trader can produce more gains over the longer term than an automated trader. BUT, if a winning system is really good long term, then you should be able to automate it and keep it a profitable system, albeit a lower profitable one.  
  
If a discretionary trader can make something work but a very good automated system cannot be profitable long-term whatsoever, that's not a good sign. The automated system will not ever match the pattern matching skills and intuition of a good discretionary trader; however, it never ever mentally tires, never fears and never experiences the effects of greed.  
  
I think it takes a good (meaning, a consistently successful), discretionary trader to be able to write a good automated system from what he/she knows how to do which is profitable. On the contrary, I've seen 100's of highly capable programmers who aren't good traders come up with nothing viable because they don't know how to be successful from by their own actions in a real-time market when real money is on the line.  
  
Forget about 80% winners and risking a 2x stop to 1x target. Forget about 70% winners and 1:1 reward to risk ratio. ALL GOOD SYSTEMS BASED ON TRENDING should be able to function near the 50/50 winners level with 1.5x to 2.0x range of reward to 1x risk ratio. Good systems are fractal in nature. A change in time frames should not alter much more than the reward to risk goals. The RATIO of that should not be impacted dramatically to yield "it works in the 5 min timeframe and daily but doesn't in the 1 min or 30 min", etc. etc.  
  
I appreciate the efforts of those here spending their time to look at this system in fine detail.

And the ratio isnt impacted. On daily your min. 1:1 RR is always measured by the signal candle, for M5 the same. The RR is always the same for type 1 entrys, but on my test before, the outcome was mostly much more than 1:2 or 1:3. So the RR is not a problem here at all, no matter the TF. Of course its up to the trader what he can make of it, therefore knowledge about price action is required. I would say you can be more profitable when you scalp this method or scalp to swing.  
  
I dont know why you think a good system has to work on every timeframe. Its in the nature of trading that one thing works on certain timeframe and dont on another. Same for this entry method. It definitely works on daily and M5, but yet I cant say if it will work for a year or a month and then the win ratio will decrease. More testing is needed.  
  
As for EA's, if they work or not says nothing about the effectiveness of this system, because you need to know about priceation, market structure etc to make this system work like OP stated. So the EA can only be as good as the programmers trading skills.  
  
For me its never about to find the final trick or "holy grail" like most people say. No matter how good the system is, you as a trader have to make the right choices and have to adapt to the market, if you fail the system fails too. There is no system and there will never be a system which will work without effort.  
One has to see trading like a race car. Eventhough you have a race car which is fast on Daytona Raceway, doesnt mean it is fast on Monaco too. Its the traders job to make the car fast on Monaco and adjust the settings, like you have to adjust in trading with a good system everyday here and there(news, fundamentals, date etc).  
That being said, the question if system x or y dont work cant be answered just by numbers or timeframes or RR. The trader has first to test it properly to find out, an EA cant do that because its limited to the programmer who is writing it.  
  
  
Like I said before, to judge someones testing it would be important to know how many trades he took. You cant expect much when you take 10 trades. I trust when people here say it dont work for me, but you get a better understanding when you know how many trades in what time period someone took.  
I appreciate everyone who share his experience.

How can you be so sure cl trader. You may very well be right but I'm a little weary of someone who sounds over confident.

Be as skeptical as you like. We're all strangers here and that is, in general, a healthy assumption. Your experience and yours alone through many many years of trading will lead you to the statistical trading truths I roughed out.  
  
Actually, I am a very humble person when it comes to trading. However, there's no need for me to defend my background / expertise in trading and the mathematics of reward vs risk levels and the bounded-ness one will face in the long-term. So believe it, don't believe it. That's entirely up to you. All I know is that I am right as rain on this subject. I don't "guess" when it comes to this. It's not over-confidence to report what one considers so overwhelming in evidence as to be factual as it relates to the future prospects of one's brokerage account funds growing over time.  
  
My only hope is that you don't have to find out the hard way...experiencing the consequences of completely ignoring what I had said, only to find out that I was right all along. If you trade within the boundaries I mentioned (these are long-term boundaries, not on a trade-by-trade basis), you are operating within a probabilistic model the markets will more easily allow you to find long-term success.  
  
Sometimes, things are genuine. This is one of those times.

No one posting, me either. It's hard enough for me to even find the 20 minutes this little strategy takes in the evening. Anyway, May had quite a positive account gain (I believe I had 17 trades hit target and seven hit SL), June was not good, red for the month, but, started to turn around the last week and a half and got a little back. Still ahead overall for the 2 months together. I am taking the signals blindly (D1) other than trying not to have more than 2-3 pairs with the same currency and my target is the size of the signal candle, which leaves a negative RR (when I have time, I want to go back over them and see how many would have made a 1:1 RR). I will be interested to see how July goes.  
  
I want to see how UC opens this week. It would be my first (W1) trade, but it looks good and has harmonic confluence, structure etc. 

Wow! I've got some experience to gain.

I just finished reading this whole thread, and reviewed the first 3 pages a couple of times, and the concept seems simple and powerful. I will be applying this to my trading, and post any results or commentaries once i get them. Thanks a lot for the input!

Where's your exit strategy (i.e. TP & SL). What's your win rate? Where's your testing results? Sorry, but a strategy is far from practical without a clear and statically-proven method to define all these components. 

If you can't measure it, you can't improve it!

Here, I've provided a colourful collection of failures. If you need more, just let me know.  
  
It takes you only 15 min (or less) to code an indicator to test your thesis before publishing it here on ForexFactory

At the end of the day all systems will fail sometimes. What counts is that the system works with a reasonably high probability. Using your test indicator can you provide the stats? %wins ? IF % wins is 70 it is already a good system.

If the win % is indeed 70, you have taken off through the stratosphere, surpassing the elite of the elite and have joined the dark forces of the mystical realm!!  
  
Since, all top professional traders are around 50-55%, I might add, are making a killing in the market!!  
Even at 30% success, your average serious trader can do quite well in Forex....how you might ask, simple, _position sizing and the risk to reward ratio_!!  
  
Cheers.

Hi Reteid, how do I get a similar strategy analyser for my indicator to show stats on chart like that? Tnx.
