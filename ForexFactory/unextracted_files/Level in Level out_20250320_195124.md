Hi nadi-fx, thanks for sharing.  
EURUSD alone or does it also use more pairs?  
I understand that he uses any level marked on the chart to enter if he is given a 1:3.  
It looks Interesting and a good time stamp to not spend all day in front of the screen.

Hi Gerval. Yes only e/u for several reason.  
1\. Because of using tight stop (30pips) so less wild wired moves, less stop hunting.  
2\. Reliability, 40% of all currency volume is on this pair, moves are meaningful.  
3\. Less screen time, checking on one pair vs several or more.  
4\. Most pairs are correlated on longer time frame anyways and dollar driven, so instead of splitting the load on serval or more pairs why not put it all on the most reliable and meaningful one.. less to watchdog.  
  
I hope it helps.

Currently short from 9805 LV.   
I would normally be short on this on its way up with sell limit but due to weekend on Friday i closed the hovering around breakeven and now since price looks to be resuming back to the LV I took it again with market order.  
I normally close all open positions (unless in massive gain) and remove all order for over weekend time just to be safe if there is a Armageddon, you never know in today's world lol.

Great Thread Nadi!  
  
Based on your first Post I can tell that you are a very experienced trader.  
  
Everyone who visits this thread should take this guy serious and learn from his Charts!  
  
____________  
  
Could you elaborate more on how you draw your Zones?  
  
I see a few squares and lines, how do they differentiate?  
Your lines are sometimes neither on the body nor on the bottom of the wick. Are the lines exactly where you want to enter, or do they just visually show where you generally want to enter (around this area).  
  
What if your desired 3R TP doesnt make too much sense as there is an important level at 1.5R? Do you take the trade? If yes, do you still use a 3R TP?   
  
Thanks for taking your time to open this thread.  
  
Good luck Trading. 

Dont be upset with the result you didnt get from the work you didnt do

Hi friend and thanks for kind words.  
Getting ready to go to bed but I will answer this one.  
  
Good observation on the LV lines. I don't use zones. I draw the lines based on the length of the wick and trade right at that level point bcz of my tight stops (30) I got to be precise and consistent to create discipline.  
So, if the length of the wick is small to mediocre (2 to 10pips) I draw the line on the middle of it. If its large like 20 pips I draw it at 2/3 and if very large I draw it inside 10 pips. I cannot be too far from the peak, because there is always a chance of retest of the very peak and some before the bounce, so need to give myself the extra 20 pips from the peak to my stop level. However you will miss triggers by a few pips off or stops to be hit by a few pips bcz LV was off a bit and that's just part of the game. All I can do is to follow the same structure for proven consistent results to go by.  
  
about profit taking on levels.. no level is important nor unimportant I treat them all the same.. I only pay attention to how jammed they are. if its not giving me the 3R I initially have the target at next level but if i see price is reacting to this mediocre level and not breaking through it then i just bank, but i give it a chance to break it. for example on the current short trade i got my tp at bottom level and not at the immediate one that is about 70 pips.  
  
The small squares are the entries. just for my notes.  
  
about position taking.. the target has nothing to do with me taking up on a level. I trade all levels bcz at any level price can bounce and take off is mass and I hate to not be on that bus.  
  
I hope it helps  
GL.

Reading the thread I saw that an operation like the one he took was prepared, this time SL.  
Prepared the following levels and testing in demo.  
It treats the levels the same, sl and tp whether or not there is a trend?, as in the current case.  
One last thing, because of the translator I did not understand correctly, when the price goes in your favor, 30 pips move to BE and let the operation develop?

Stop was hit on this one.. that level had two bounces prior to this last one and 3rd one did not hold up the level is broken and dead now.  
The previous two trades on this LV went in favor and looked promising but never broke the 60 pips mark therefore I BE on both.  
This is where the one-time trail to BE after 30 pips gain comes handy. Just wanted to point it out as a recent example, but it finally got me after 3 tries lol, np.

Yes, so when you place you limit order you also put in a 30 pips trail stops. That means when price goes in your favor for 30 pips the SL moves to Breakeven (BE) and then you remove the Trail stop.   
I do not trail stop my position I just do the one-time trail stop to BE and that's it. I secure a no loss after been rewarded with some leeway.  
  
I hope it helps.

10695 LV is the next one likely to be triggered with sell limit. 30pips hard stop in place the 30 pips one time trail in place and target I put it between the two jammed levels for about +140 I will exit that trade no matter what at that point, it's a good enough profit what my plan and goal I can care or less if this drops in mass.  
just thinking ahead of time based on structure and plan.. that level could get run through and shoot up to the moon and take me for 30, np... or yet worse, it could fake out for 40 hit my 30 stops then runs down, lol... it's all part of the game.  
you look at my chart and see some of the trades are look to be absurd and say to yourself well i can avoid those its too obvious!! ok.. you do that and you will lose out on big gains from the tiniest unimportant levels for sure hands down. you will have price coming at your sell limit with so much heat lets say after some major news and most if not all of you will remove that limit order bcz you think it will for sure run though it or to at least hit your tight stops of 30.. but only to watch and witness one of the best bounces of your life (eg, 2nd chart)  
So, I don't know, all I can do is to watch my behind.

Hi Nadi,  
Why do you not have a buy at 9686? I assume this would also be a target for the sell at 10695.  
  
Thanks!!!

Hi Dave,  
Why would I have a buy LV at 9686? there is no level there, it is in a middle of nowhere.  
The buy levels are at 9398 and 9104.

My sell limit order at 10695 was missed to be hit by couple of pips... Hate to see it run down without me in it, but it happens.  
So far a small bounce, hopefully it will retest the peak in full this time.

Beautiful bounce was missed by a hair good for 100 pips as of right now. This kind of things happen time to time... painful to watch when not in it lol.  
I hope any of you who are following maybe cut this.

Pa looks good to be producing reasonable bounces inside these 250 pips sideway chop-ish movement, trending is less likely... but who knows tho just taking it at face value.

I noticed PA reacted to this tiny mediocre level, I don't mind taking a shot at it... the buy in on.  
There are two other levels below this one that I initially looked to take up on and still have buy limit on both... either price goes crazy bear and zip through all of them or bounce of off one of them, won't be in it till test it.

Hi nadi,  
When determining your levels, do you use any sort of trendline breaks to filter out the mediocre levels? I assume they are mediocre because they fall between a high and low levels?  
  
thx

Hi Dave,   
No, no trend lines... throughout my career I have tried to stay away from trend lines bcz they are hard to draw and are controversial, I could never find a solid structure for it that I can rely on... they just look sexy after the fact IMHO.  
Mid-levels are smaller V's or less data less volume that's why they may not be as strong or reliable... I have no problem with mid-levels they payoff well too.  
Instead of filtering I manage risk and stay true to my tight stops.  
  
I hope it helps.

Nice bounce off the 9610 LV a mediocre one. Looks promising to hit the target at about 85 pips at zero risk SL been trailed to BE after 40 pips gain.  
I hope most if not all off you are in it.

It seems that if I react well on that level.  
Let's see if it rises and goes for the liquidity of the double top before going back down.

Waking up to a good one... sweet little profit of about 85pips off the 9706 LV.  
so, for the week 3 trades with two loss and one win but a bottom line of +25... if i was fortune enough for that sell limit to be triggered, I already had hit the 100 pips weekly goal with 3 more days in the week to go. I may have messed up on drawing that LV line incorrectly as I look at it now, it happens.

I put the entry according to previous max and I'm still inside, Yesterday I did not take the entry for a few pips and today it has not taken me out for those same pips. Watching how it develops.  
Would the TP leave you at the previous level above 9670?  
It has traveled 30 pips in favor, and I have it in BE

I see you stuck with the old peak LV and it's working out for you atm.  
Yes take the 100... after that point the next 50 pips its the rough area for PA to travel to with two jammed up LV which Price could easily bounce off of it, I would just bank on that level.  
  
Up top, the correct LV is where I placed it after witnessing yesterday's peak, price clearly reacted to the wick on (the red circle) and I just simply missed that. otherwise, I would have been triggered with yesterday short good for another 3R and totally would be ok with today's SL bcz of it... I take that over this.  
that is why the preciseness of the LV is super vital when it gets rough like this. I missed the short by two pips and my stop today was hit by 2pips lol. so instead of being up 100 pips up 25.. big difference but its ok... who said trading was easy lol.  
Thats the beauty of trading.

The way Price is reacting around the 10620 level is a very good lesson for the thread followers. Most times you will get a clean bounce, or a clean stop hit. But there are times when price plays around at the level like what we are witnessing now.. it gave us a false break out and hoovering around the level still as to not sure if it's going to head down or resume the bull run or go circles.  
so usually at this time I just sit on my hands and at least wait to see how the H4 candle closes if I have to take another shot at it going short, it has sting me already once. This level now is a suspect and a suspicious one... more time will reveal its hand, and if it run short now me not in it, it's fine bcz I already took a shot at it and can't do much about fake outs, it's part of the game. A guy told me once, "you atta make out with fake out" lol ... it will happen, be ok with it.  
The point I am trying to hit home is;  
To not start wondering  
To not start messing around with Stops level (move it from 30-40 or 50 or extended to next level etc)  
To question everything just bcz one level or handful of levels behave this way... be ok with the loss and the deceive... this market is a beast.  
... stay the course  
  
I am not lecturing by no means... just giving insight of what I do and go about it based on my own hard-fought experience throughout years.  
I also know and understand why there isn't enough followers so no need to lecture much but for a few that are here this prime live example should work out well and I couldn't hold back. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

I agree with you, the TP after 100 can bounce in any previous minimum, also it already meets the 1:3 ratio, we will see the retesting it does.  
I put above the highest maximum because it is common to take liquidity from 2 or 3 high peaks and more at the beginning of the American session.  
If there was bad luck with the short entry and the SL for two pips and it is still in the green... it means that when it develops normally and in the long term it will compensate you.

Can't get a better hammer than this one, good lord... its hammer time baby, lol  
BUT..  
I can't take a short when is 25 points away of my LV... discipline comes to play.  
The reality of this good looking hammer is that it is very large it well extended and broke above the last peak with lots of volume and action on it, which barely the bears won... level remains suspect.  
This could still well play around this level, retest the top or the LV again before finally and if dropping down. So, I gotta enter out of place and risk my tight stop hit right at the level or extend my stop from 30 to above 60!! hell no.  
the only way i would get back on this horse is at the new LV off the wick around 10860

Because you want an indicator that shows you something when the live chart is telling you, look at the highs and lows with respect to the MACD and you will see how it indicates wrong or late, what it could indicate is whether it is going to reach a maximum or minimum and a divergence is taking place... Although wait for nadi-fx to clarify your doubts better.  
To draw the limits, the creator of the thread indicates it in post 7.

We continue to hold the position, if they accumulate a lot up top and they intend to go down, they may possibly shoot up and take me out, but discipline is discipline.  
I still have to get used to these H4 deadlines a bit.

No matter what the trend is Price still plays level to level most times!!... as we all got to know that no price goes straight up or down... pullbacks are a given and resumes are a possibility, so with level to level you could easily fall into trends automatically at the luxury of double tops/bottoms.  
So, I have eliminated the stress of trend or no trend off my trading style and take things at face value to test the market at peaks and valleys where money was either inserted In or Out, some are strong some are not and meant to be broken resume trend or held tight to bounce to start a whole new move which I am in it from the very beginning where it creates lots of room for me to may let it ride and enjoy the also so called trend for more than my 3R goal.  
  
I hope it helps.

> Ignored

The MacD has nothing to do with my trading bcz is super lagging like every other indicator... it's just a visual for after the fact that there was a peak or valley after i have already taken action on it. When you trade with limit orders you are ahead of all indicators! meaning you are not waiting for confirmations to do xyz. That is why you see zero indicators on my chart.  
About drawing the lines i have explained it in first a few posts I think please refer there. But in short no Zones... need to draw the line precise and trade right at that. You could use zones too but its not a clear discipline structure, your stop hit will be affected when you use zone unless increase the stop level to much higher like 60 from 30... now you are looking at a totally different ball game.  
  
I hope it helps.

its right you got it... on HH or peaks you use sell limit and on LL or valleys you use buy limits.   
you are basically counter trading when taking action on bounces so when price is going up you sell and going down you buy.

I wanna show you guys something, just my humble take...  
Since the Trend issue has arisen which was a given, very common one and an important one, so I address it with example, so you all know where I am coming from.  
  
Look at the first chart which is the weekly chart. We had one of the longest lasting bear trends in E/U in recent times. It lasted 15 months, that's 60 weeks for total of 27Cents or 2700 pips. The overall trend has been bearish (dollar strong) since 2008... leg down in 2008 another leg down 2014 and this last one as I just pointed out.  
now back to the example... if I had a crystal ball, I would have made one sell trade and keep it for 2700 pips! one clean position stress free paying less fees less to none screen time letting that baby ride to make banks right at the end of it for 2700pips, just beautiful... but I don't, nor will I need it or want it to be honest with you... bcz I can make more through Peaks and Valleys without the complications of trends and duration of it... not to mention trading is my passion and I want to be more engaged. I love getting up in the morning be excited to check my charts making adjustment reading articles etc before heading to real life work and business.  
I should also mention that position trading is very profitable, but it is for big institutions, and we are just little retail traders with much much smaller accounts. That is a different ball game.  
okey, as I was saying that trend lasted for 60 weeks... even if I make 50pips a week I can beat 2700 pips and had to never worry or stress about what overall trend was is or doing. Spotting a trend _beforehand and lasting in it_ is very difficult, stressful, unpredictable and you name it.  
Now look at the next chart. I mentioned in the initial first post the expectation and goal are to make 100pips a week, some weeks you will some don't but in the end, it all averages out if you stick to the plan and stay the course. So, in the 2nd chart you see how simply you will make way more than 100 pips in any given week to make up for loss weeks or no gain weeks. If you scroll though the past you will see good solid weeks where in 200 pips overall weeks of movement you have managed to make 200 or even 300 pips just bouncing up and down or catch a nice little runner on the jammed space when it breaks out with your target at a next level to be... in feature we will see those live, I hope.  
60 weeks' time times 100 pips are 6000 pips, and I could care or less about market trend. I rather bank on the obvious... historically market sideways 2/3 of times than it trends and pullbacks are given, price cannot not go straight up or down, period. Those are facts that I can rely and bank on.  
  
I hope it makes sense and if it does not, I can understand... this is just my humble way of thinking and trading the market... hence I don't downplay or eliminate trend completely out of my trading its just not priority if I fall into it great if not it is not the core of what i do.  
  
Now, the trend advocates, please don't beat me down, I don't want any part of it you win, and I respect your opinions, market knowledge hands down. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
In trading you should know YOU, that's your real edge. I know me that I am incapable of Predicting the market... incapable of complications... but capable of simplicity, structures. I try to do my best to follow my plan as I have learned to earn from this market, and I should say, humbly for now... this is a beast that we are dealing with, never doubt that.

I understand your method and targets, but right in this situation - why 9947? There is no extremum at this price, so could you please show the logic of making this level significant?

Do you use horizontal price alerts so you know that price is close to an area of intrest, pre-marked level, to place your pending orders? If so, would you share how you do that. I'm assuming that you just don't place pending orders at every level that you identify.

Objective reached.  
  
1- SL (-30 pips)  
2- TP (+95 pips)  
  
Nadi-fx you said that it moves BE when it goes 30 pips in its favor, but in case you see that it is close to 1:3 and it turns against you in a significant way, act in some way if you are in front of the screen or let it develops alone without acting?

Current situation is not looking too bad... the 9947-level stop was hit by a pip or two kinds of unfortunate but got a nice bounce on the next level-9709 which is at +70 close to hitting the target around 100 with stops at BE.

How do you know there is extremum on this level or any level anyways.  
This a mediocre Level that I have already explained in previous posts. You got a clear bottom with a nice wick where price was rejected, I take that all day long. That trade almost worked; my stop was hit by a pip otherwise at this very moment i would have been in two long positions heading north with heat.  
  
I hope it helps

If I understood you correctly you are talking about profit taking.  
As I have said I don't trail my stops although way... it's just a one-time initial trail to BE.. I don't want to lose on a position that it was in some favorable gain like 40 pips or so, I am okey to BE on those if it turns on me instead of giving up 30 on top.. and its 30-40 nothing concrete. you see a trade going in your favor and giving you some room, so you want to set stops at BE, zero risk seeing where it leads.  
About profits... I mentioned 3R as initial goal and beyond if you are getting 100 pips and price is hitting a solid Level and reacting to it, you want to bank there. Like I did on last buy trade, banked 85 at 10655ish level or like you banked on your sell trade at 9693ish level for a cool 100pips, solid trade buddy.. I got sting with the stop hit as by two pips as you all watched.  
  
I hope it helps.

I see a level that is qualified enough I set my limit order, stops.

Good question.  
I try not to. Most times I close it. Like this buy trade that I am in... if the target is not hit and its hanging around +70 pips or so I would just bank it and call the week.  
However, if ever i was lucky enough to fall into a trend that I am in significant gains like 200 pips and going on a strong PA, in such rare case I would secure +100 and let it ride over the weekend with plenty of room to not be affected by Gap action.  
  
The main reason for not leaving positions open over the weekend is to not risk your account. If a financial Armageddon happens your stops will not be honored, and you could lose your whole account (could get massive gain too)... so not wise to risk that.  
  
Therefore its better off to close all position remove all orders keep the account free and clear. I have alert set for hour before the Friday close to assess the situation to do so.  
  
I hope it helps.

Clean chart the buy position closed an hour before market close good for +55 and all other orders removed.  
I netted +45 on five trades, 3 stops and 2 winners one full one half. A bit disappointed I didn't get my weekly goal of 100. On sideway action week the results should be better... realistically the week was good for +140... if the bounces were a bit less sharp could have been a 200+ week. Not bad for a week when PA range was no more than about 140pips all together.  
The real dagger for me was missing the sell trade by 2 pips... also, two stops being hit by 1-2 pips didn't help either otherwise I would have had a monster week. Thats the way it goes at times.  
Missing the first sell trade was totally my mistake as i did not draw my line correctly off by 4pips or so.  
  
Just the little summary of the week behind us.  
  
Great having you all around.  
  
GL.

Thanks for sharing your trading style and the details on how you approach the market. Your focus on risk management and sticking to a plan with discipline is a valuable reminder for all traders.   
One question: How do you determine your trade size for the upcoming weeks based on your available equity?

Yes, based on available equity risking 1-2%.  
  
$1500 x 2% = $30 / 30 pips SL = $1 per pips  
  
Accounts 50K under risk 2%... 50K+ risking 1% (recommendation)  
  
GL  
  
ps) I must add, when we talk equity, you must assess that safely. Equity is floating! Meaning your open positions could go against you and you must know what the worst-case scenario is and calculate your risk accordingly.  
Otherwise just go based on Balance.

Hi thanks for your thread.  
A couple of questions if I may.  
  
Do you drop down into smaller time frames when looking to exit a trade or are you strongly disciplined to remain on H4?  
Do you ever have multiple positions open and if so does this come about by adding market orders or do you place limit orders again?  
  
Thanks

Hi ax,   
No, I never drop down if anything I look up to D1. Anything under H4 is noise to me.  
I hardly ever have multiple open positions... if I ever do is on two instances;  
1) When I am on hedge... meaning I decided to not exit at a level looking for more profit but at the same time been triggered at that level in opposite way, bcz I still will test the level.  
2) I could be in some trades in heavy profit for 1/10 the load... for eg, I have banked 90% and just let 10% run for however long it maybe.  
This is something I was going to get into in this thread when the opportunity arrived.  
  
I hope it helps.

There are serval brokers. Please do own research.  
  
To all...  
I would like to not have any broker discussions in this thread, respectfully.

Here are the levels for this week I got five limit order going to start it al off.  
The whole range inside this sideway action is 190pips. If PA plays inside the box, you will make money... if it breaks out, you will be hit with some stops but might be riding in on a breaking out. targets if you choose to set one should be on top and bottom to get 3R+... for now I have left it alone to not crowed the chart also might give the PA the chance to break out one for me to enjoy a bit of a trend money, who knows.  
Most importantly you don't wanna miss a ride and for that you need to test the market at these levels.  
gotta be in it to win it lol.  
  
I highly welcome you to share your chart.  
  
Best of luck to all for this week's trading.

Recommendation;  
I have my phone alarm set to check the chart every 4hrs on start of every H4 candle.  
At my time zone west coast time it goes like this... 2PM market open and close, 6pm,10pm... 2am off bcz i am sleep and don't wanna be bothered at no cost.. 6am, 10am.  
5-10min spent on the chart if I have to make adjustments but more importantly to just be engaged with what's going on.

Hi, Yes I do. I have been trading the same way for long time bcz my market philosophy is to get in out where money seems to be getting in and out which is at Levels.  
However, don't take my word for it and go broke lol... forward trading in this thread will tell.  
... also as you know, in the end of the day results would vary from trader to trader.

This level is tricky, price clearly bounced nicely from it but if I would take up on this level it had to be based on the new high which is that long wick a bit higher. Quiet a bit of money was inserted there to push and reject so if price gets there again it very well could test the HH... so at 10611 my stop will be hit.  
I like the observation, good on you I hope my take helps.

Morning, good question.  
I don't put too much weight on news bcz I am on higher TF and won't fall victim to whiplash as much as the lower tf do.  
However, on the major ones like NFP and Rates if I have too many jammed up orders on levels close to the price before such news releases, I just make sure the closest one is at least 50-70+ pips away.  
for example, this week we have the nfp & FOMC and we are in a tight range, let's say price stays still at where it is I will remove the in between order and take my chances with tops and bottoms only. That would be 9117 and 10835.  
Overall, I personally not too concerned about any news... my risk is plenty wise and all such stops hit is all pre accounted. at times I give up a 30-40 (on whiplash your SL will be more bcz of speed on the price or gap at times) in seconds when price just runs through it and other times, I get a nice bounce for major gains and possibly fall into a deep trend.  
I recommend to for thread and inexperience, to sit on your hands at such major news till feel more confident.  
  
I hope it helps.

yep, again lol... but it's more like 5 pips tho, it's fine.  
PA don't seem to have much strength and most likely will just play up and down in a tight range till Fomc.

The buy trade above is good example of staying the course.  
Some of you might pass on this when you see price coming at you with 70 pips straight heat!! or say lets wait and see how it reacts around it to not get in with limit, too risky.   
Sure, it might work this time or some other time, but bounces happen really fast, and you end up either missing the trade or getting in late out of place to risk stop hit... or yet worse add length to the stop to cover the HH LL possibility of losing more, which will affect the bottom-line.  
  
See, I eliminate all that stress and just let it play out... my risk is predetermined, and I am good with it.  
I cannot miss the bus.  
  
Just a little humble take on mental stuff.

Two questions if I may....  
1\. For the top sell level why is the order placed at that level on the wick?  
2\. for the buy level second from the bottom (around 1.09408) which candle is the level based on, and why was that candle/wick selected?  
Thanks

Is your stop loss on this first trade right at the same level as your next buy limit?

First question... I have explained this on previous pages np here is again... on long wick like this one I just go 10 pips inside and set the level there.  
2nd question... it's based on first bottom and wick on the 24th (the circle), price reacted two other time on that level bouncing nicely from it at same spot so I just left it the same.

As I pointed out in the chart... a lot of activities on those bounces where new money was inserted and finally gave in to the bulls.  
That is even more of a reason why I stand ground on my levels and limit order, even when price approaches it with lots of heat, 70pips full bold H4 candle.  
... is valid till crushed lol...  
however, most if not all levels are meant to be broken at some point and time, it's just a matter of how profitable it was before it breaks out.

Yes, it happens to fall right on the below buy limit.  
My stop loss is 30pips and I don't care where it lands, period.  
Playing around with the stop loss it's a system of its own... one can write a book about it and still be lost.   
I have learned to keep up with a discipline risk vs skill. That way I can manage risk and rely on a stat.

on the bottom you should have been triggered price traveled even a few pips below.  
My observation on your chart is, it serves you better if you could clearly draw the LV line on all levels... it's a good visual to have at all times and one glance.

I have tried to adjust between your entry points and lower tf, so... but you run the risk of not entering the order.

Guys do not draw your LV on any TF other than H4. The LV's are based on high tf... on lower tf you will have whole bunch more levels, less reliable. D1 is too far out and conservative and H1 and under too much noise, go with the middle which is H4.  
Train yourself to stick to one TF when choosing your Levels.  
  
Just my humble take.

Nadi,  
You mentioned that your trades either blow past your stop or move in your direction. Have you experimented with a reverse trade after say 35 pips with a shorter stop, like 15 pips? thoughts?

I am not sure if I understand your question...  
  
You mean when trade goes in your favor for 35 pips move the stop to 15 pips!!?  
if that's the case and I understood correctly... I already have answered this in the first post... I have a one-time trail stop to breakeven after 30-40 pips gain.  
  
If you mean to overall experiment with initial 15 pips stop!!!.. no absolutely not bcz that is way too close and too tight of a stop to deal with... even my 30pips is still too tight any smaller than that will cause to miss big gains.  
...offense is first defense second. Nothing matters is continuously keep getting kick out of winners.  
  
I hope I got it right lol

Hello nadi-fx  
  
Great thread and following with interest.  
The latest buy trade you entered at 9704 can you highlight where your take profit is so I can compare if I have it right.  
Still learning this but not 100% sure whether you religious have a 3-1 Risk to reward or take profit at the next level regardless if risk reward.  
Thank you for your time. 

Thank You James16, Fijitrader, Mbqb1, ghous, Pinbar and Jarroo. cpfleger

Hi, my take profit on this trade is already set up top at 10750 about 100pips. I initially always shoot for 3R especially if it falls into a solid level, I bank it like where I have for this buy trade. However, there is a level before that at 10388ish around 70 pips profit, If I see price not breaking it easily and plays around it, I could just take the 70 there. In another words I will not settle so easily for take profit when a level is lower than 3R or 90 pips and initially is set at following level.  
Nothing is set in stone, but I will stand my ground to get my 3Rs and wont panic or give up on littles threats.  
  
Overall, it's about having a structure and following it, but in a frame of managing risk too... many things to consider in different circumstances, such as;  
what day of the week I am,  
what kind of profit or loss I am at,  
am I excelling or bleeding,  
... and a few other factors... and then to act accordingly.  
  
I give you couple of scenarios...  
let's say it's Thursday week is winding down, I have had 3 trades all losses, so I am down 90 pips... I enter the 4th trade, it is not a loser but only a weak winner meaning its stuck at some mediocre level where it could easily turn on me and eat my profit. At this juncture its wise for me to bank a descent some if I can, let's say 65pips to reduce the bleeding, one more day in the week is left and I may not be able to survive such week... so I accept and walk away with my 25 pips loss for the week or a better opportunity later... keeping my head above the water.  
another one could be... its Wednesdays, been in couple of trade one win one loss and I am up +60... on following trade I will follow the structure fully and stay on offense aggressively to reach my 100pips avg goal and possibly beyond.  
The name of the game is to survive first and to go for the kill second... for me IMHO.  
  
In normal circumstances I follow my structure religiously to answer your question, let it play out the way it should.  
  
I hope it help and I answered it to best I could.

So given we have a limit order to sell at 1.10367 ish will you cancel that depending on price action and your confidence in carrying on with the buy trade, or let things play out? Just want to understand how hands on you are after setting up the trades. 

its all just one persons opinion....

Let things play out. I for most if not always take my shot at up coming LV.  
I will give my buy the shot to break through and at the same time don't miss out on the new trade in opposite way. I don't know what's going to happen at that level, I just don't know.   
I treat each trade as it's own.

Now, this move (red circle) allows me to put my Stop at BE. It serves me well to be at a risk-free trade before going to bed. I can only wake up to a nice surprise and not a bad one, I like that.

nice tread.  
I notice you use recent Levels. I look left and draw level where most touches are. questions so many but how you define the level is getting weak or price will not respect the level or how many time you trade same level ? I use 3 touches then I feel level not going to hold. unless its major S/R. I mark block on EU 3 touch reference points. thanks

Morning  
  
With regard to say a buy order running with a 90 pip TP above the entry. But we have a sell order at 70 pips above where we took the long would the sell order not negate and close the long position. I have never tried it so may be dependent on the broker used (IE if they operate order cancels order)

Up late.... so now you are out of that open trade?  
  
Regardless, I can now see why the 30-pip trailing stop makes sense. Gets you out of a minor move at BE and allows you to wait for the next level to enter

Good morning to all... I see long trade is closed but at breakeven. That level is dead now, but it served as a profitable one with serval nice bounces.  
My 9408 LV was missed to be triggered by a hair this time less than a pip, I think.  
  
I get your post shortly. Coffee time.

hi and thank you.  
The answer to this question is in my first post... but thread is young, and I'll answer it again.  
I filter with "Time", Two weeks. Recent levels! as you also mentioned. Recent to me is two weeks. Otherwise, you will have a level at every step of the price.  
If no reaction on a level after two weeks is dead to me, I don't care how strong once it was.  
so in short...  
* Two weeks with no rejection reaction  
* or... once is broken.

your fellow trader here name axecap asked similar question i have explained there, so please refer to post 104.  
but on extended explanation;  
I treat each trade as individually and at its own... so I could be in both trade going the opposite direction of each. if i am in buy then 70 pips later there is a level for sell, i take the sell and may leave the buy still open for more profit. this happens for most cases when my 3R has not meet. I stand ground for that.  
But if I have meet my 3R profit and then i got a level coming I bank and reverse. At no cost I will not let a new level trade opportunity to be wasted.  
  
Technically speaking... you will need to operate with a broker that allows hedge or no FIFO.

Yes buddy it serves well most time but also stings you at times too when fakes you out one more time before taking off. But you wanna be more safe than sorry.  
on this one I was fortunate enough to notice the move before going to bed and manually move it to BE at 35 pips gain... if i am sleep my trail is set at 40.  
Overall that bounce was kind of weak from get go and I could expect this to not be a super star move.  
The one-time trail 30-40 pips serve well in the long run. The key is when you do get faked and kicked out before runs to the moon to _Not affect_ you and start change things around.  
Stay the course, it's all part of the game.

It is unreal how I missed this nice strong bounce, less than a pip. and my LV is right on the money, no mistakes there, it's just a mis.  
... nothing ever bothers me more than this kind of things lol. It's a bummer.

Great trigger and perfect situation to be before announcment.  
  
Now for the sake of the thread...  
I will keep eye on this trade to see how it plays out before the release... where and when is positioned to whether bank it all or some or let it ride the release etc,... exciting stuff.

Nadi-fx, when a trade is fulfilled, as with buy#2 in the post above… do you enter another pending buy order at that same level to replace it? In this case I am assuming you do.

I sure do, that level is very much intact great bounce off of it where you enjoyed that 90pips profit.

Here is my chart with sell trade at 10364 LV ahead of the fomc release... price hoovering around BE if stays like this before the release stop is in major jeopardy to fall in victim of whiplash. In reverse, the ideal situation would have been if this sell was already in about 50 pips gain, then our stop at BE and give it chance to drive short at zero risk but it seems unlikely to say the least lol.  
I very much keep the Buy limit up top and will place it only about 5pips inside the peak considering news impact on the price with speed wilderness. If it's meant to drive the price bearish, we could get trigger there for a nice bounce, who knows.  
Not the best ideal position on to be with the current sell trade but it is what it is worst case scenario you will give up 30... but some of you are sitting pretty already with 90 in the bank lol.  
Let's see how it plays out... NEWS days are just another day in the office... don't make too much out of it bcz you are in NO control. unless you are Jimmy buffet or something.

Be prepared for two stops to be hit or be rewarded with a major gain, or to clear your chart and sit on your hands till dust settles, that is totally fine too. Only YOU are in charge of your risk management for your account. There is always pros and cons, risk reward. The difference is we keep our risk limited and our reward extended.  
One win clears at least 3 losses.  
As a retail trader who is at the mercy of secondhand info following the footsteps of price and not leading the price. There is a big difference there my friends, to follow and not lead. Therefore, 3R is my best friend... so when I do fall in-line with the big boys (1 in 3 times) I have to maximize. At least the way I trade.  
all in IMHO.  
  
I just wanted to throw that out there before wild time.

Now the best ideal situation to be on the buy trade that we had a massive bounce yesterday. I was super bum stunned how it missed me by hair. I wanted to be in driver sit for the major news coming up this week.  
This is how I would have played it out;  
today is sitting at 100+ pips cushion. I would set my take profit sitting at 50-60 pips or halfway and let that baby ride if its meant to go bull. Or, scale it by taking half off and letting it ride. By no means I would have liquidated the whole position. Because the reward could be massive at times after such news, and you could be sitting on a ride for long time.  
Now what that does for your bottom line is to wipe all or most of your stops hit or to be hit even if you have 2/10 of the position riding.  
Just something to keep in back of your mind for the next time.

Please if I may ask how did you get 1.09429 as entry. Did you make your calculations based on Nadi-Fx formula? Which H4 swing did you make use of. Still wondering how come Nadi-Fx got the price of 1.0941ish. But I am still getting to grip with the system

Hi jewel, please read the first post and study the chart attached.  
In this particular LV all you gotta do is to look to your left... you see the bottoms a few days before with long wicks visiting the same spot, that is equal to a level.  
Where to exactly put your LV, referee to one of the early posts, I have explained it in detail.

I am assuming NOT... because the candle broke the level and closed above the level. That said the close of the next 4 hour candle could indicate a fakeout

Thank you for your response. I read everything before now. The post 7 is what I am trying to apply to this entry. from my understanding, the applicable swing is either H4 candle of April 21st at 8.00 or April 20th at 12.00. In the case of both candles, the wick is longer than 20 pips. So my understanding is the 10 pips inward rule should apply.  
The low of 20th is 1.09380 and so limit should be at 1.09480 and also;  
the low of 21st is 1.09334 and so limit should be at 1.09433.  
I hope that I have the right understanding of what you kindly shared?  
Thank you for your time and efforts

Jewel... that was the way I analyzed it. However, I was one of the fortunate who had their trade trigger... because in retrospect I wasn't 100% precise with the 10 pip rule... my entry was at 1.0943 rather than 1.09433. Hope that helps.

Good afternoon and greetings from The Netherlands.  
  
I've very recently returned from this :  
  

Inserted Video

  
  
... and have been thinking about trading a longer timeframe: H4 will do nicely.  
  
Trade #1 below, using a futures contract, albeit a tiny micro contract, as I trade futures (as you can see my Long trade from yesterday did not fill) :

Okey the buy trade stop was hit quickly right after announcement... but should be in the short trade from up top 10845ish LV working out nicely at statement time. Should already have recouped the earlier loss.  
Remains to be seen tho...

Correct.   
But even if it did not close above the level, just bcz of the high reaction on it creating a long wick and resuming its still dead and the new LV is based on the new wick peak.

I wouldn't go to BE just yet as this is still in turmoil, statement is not fished yet price could give it retest.  
I know based on structure the trails stop has meet, but this is news time gotta be a bit crafty in relation to the news time.  
But its up to you guys, being safe is good... but it might kick you out and resume you be out of the ride.  
there is always pros and cons.

The post 7 is what I am trying to apply to this entry. from my understanding, the applicable swing is either H4 candle of April 21st at 8.00 or April 20th at 12.00. In the case of both candles, the wick is longer than 20 pips. So my understanding is the 10 pips inward rule should apply. The low of 20th is 1.09380 and so limit should be at 1.09480 and also; the low of 21st is 1.09334 and so limit should be at 1.09433. I hope that I have the right understanding of what you kindly shared?...

Spot on brother.  
it's based on your first highlighted candle the long wick one... exactly correct going in 10 pips inward.  
  
Now based on different brokers the price could be off by a bit for all of us... so by a few 10ths of a pips some will get triggered and some wont, that is exactly why I missed it.

I was thinking of going to sleep with BE, but with the volatility so high now the BE is very close, we will leave it as at the beginning and tomorrow, as you say, we will see a pleasant surprise or not.

If no reaction on a level after two weeks is dead to me, I don't care how strong once it was. so in short... * Two weeks with no rejection reaction * or... once is broken. GL

Please if I may ask, is the swing level of April 17th with buy limit order at 1.09118 still meeting the time filter of two weeks maximum? It is now two weeks and some few days old!!!  
just for clarifications please

Bounced around and stopped out except for the sell triggered at 1.1089.   
Nadi, assuming we go back up and revisit that area would you have another sell limit order there,  
and if so would you shift your current stop loss above the entry point?  
Thanks

Hi Jewel,  
If it's over two weeks, I don't put too much weight on it any longer. This one is still inside a bracket (sideway action), but it doesn't matter, it's been too long with no reaction and the initial action its mostly diminished by now. That level still may give the best bounce of the world, but I rather follow a structure that I can rely on in the long run.

You are and should be already in it from earlier trigger, so no need to re-enter again as this trade never surpassed the turmoil. However, if you used the trail stop and now kicked out at BE it's also fine. But I would not re-renter on any level unless I get a whole new V action.  
I personally still in this as is shown on the chart below with stop at 30pip intact.

Now is a good time to set the trail stop, your target and just let it play out. hopefully we got some cushion tomorrow and in a good position to ride the NFP at zero risk.  
remains to be seen...

If as a result of your arrogance or immaturity or both, you are unable to understand that there may be a fragment of "truth", however small, that you may know nothing about, then you need to re access your perception of reality. And again if it is only what you know that is knowledge and that whatever you don't know is not worth knowing and is as a matter of fact not "knowledge", may be you are the one busy in lala-land. The fact that you could talk so condescendingly to people that you don't even know says much about the state of your mental health IMO.  
I have always had you on my ignore list, one of only two people on the list. I decided to remove all ignore just recently. So when you showed up in this thread, the first thing I did was to read your recent posting to see if you have changed, but no. You are still spilling your version of what is generally known as "A TALE TOLD BY AN IDIOT, FULL OF SOUND AND FURRY, SIGNIFYING NOTHING."  
I hope the thread starter will not encourage you to deface his thread with your nonsense  
  
PS i know you like fruitless banters and I am not likely going to respond any further to you

Hi nadi, I don't trade like this but it's been fun reading the way you're being passionate to educate us all, and the way this system works.  
One question, with this style of bouncing-here-and-there kind of trading, on average how many % do you bank per week or month?

TBH I left my trade at the 30 pips SL because of the anticipated volatility expected from the myriad of news reports

It's all good, nothing is set in stone if you feel comfortable managing risk that way under different circumstances that's the way to go.  
I was going to bed so could not watch dog it and was already bleeding for 30 so didn't want to wake up to a unpleasant surprise this time lol.  
It's all about going to your tool bag and pick what's work for you as a trade.  
great job.

Its okey... repetition will build confidence in time.  
  
I probably would have been in this trade still if I had not missed the buy trade on Tuesday (good for 140pips) and down 30 pips on Wednesdays. If was sitting on +100 with a open position in profit at zero risk, I would have let it ride and risk to get more with NFP.  
But must deal with reality of current position.

Sounds good... but my level is up higher where it was before, 10845 ish LV  
I know you see the new wick but it's not a peak and is just a continuation of that bear move, however price could just react to that and bounce, it's just not my structure that I could go by.

yes my LV is 1.10865 too. Just expecting a bounce if it gets to that area and treat it as a sort of sell trade continuation

I would have thought that today being NFP news day, you would have reduced your limit orders to just the extremes 0940/1086 because of anticipated volatility.  
I believe it is the reason you put the new buy limit order at 9908 instead of 9960.May be I am not yet getting somethings right

No, just doing what I do normally. The wick is about 21 pips so down 2/3.. or inward 7 pips.  
  
about orders on extremes, you are correct to be in safe side. I am just hoping to be triggered before the release, which most likely won't happen. Price atm is 50 pips away from each limit, it's a decent distance I just keep it.   
I will be sleep most likely when NFP happens, but I am comfortable with the orders and stop hits.

Nice nadi-fx  
  
That's about the same here too.  
  
What would you recommend with the current trade we are in. would you normally close the trade before weekend closing?  
  
The other limit trades not yet triggered, would you normally cancel them before close of today and re-evaluate on next weeks opening.  
  
I remember you writing about it but cant seem to find it now.  
  
Thank you for your time.

I see where it lands hour before the close... I normally close open position, but most likely i will keep this one open over weekend I like the engulf in the making.  
Other orders I will delete them all at close.  
plz find that post because I think I went more in depth on this matter.  
  
Great trade. well done.

Hi nadi-fx  
  
Would you now be considering 10475 ish as a new mid level on market open next week if price hasn't reached it today ?

Yes, I would, it is a level. It is a mediocre level with some FOMC implications. This a refection spinner H4 spinner candle.  
I wouldn't put a sell limit there for a new trade because is Friday and market close and give the buy trade a chance to break it hopefully. so it remains to be seen still.  
i will make post about all this near close or after.  
  
I like how you are paying attention to details... it becomes handy when things get rough at times ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

I exited with 40+ pips gain. Hoping for a re entry at around 1.10 on Monday if it retraces down to that level.  
Thank you once again nadi-fx

For better understanding may I ask you to post one more picture without non actual old levels? I see here so many lines that I'm afraid I'm lost in them.

I can't do that buddy I like to have the old lines on my chart.  
But, my chart is always up to date with levels. Any Level lines that you see is cut, that level no longer is in play.

I came to think of it I can open a new chart... here it is.  
I drew the current LV in play and the origin of it (red circles)  
  
I hope it helps.

Week in review...  
We were blessed with five level to level trade opportunities to deal with in sideway action. FOMC/NFP week and no real breakout occurred... NFPs dust still is not settled tho, and that is why I kept my buy position open hoping for bullish continuation.  
Produced two winners +140/+80... one stop hit -30... one BE and one pending, in profit for 20 at zero risk as of now.  
Overall, a successful week with surpassing the weekly goal and beyond.  
However, as you all know some of us did not trigger on the buy trade and I was one of them. But still, managed to bank +50 for the week with an open buy position at +20 on zero risk. Hopefully shoots up so I can meet my weekly goal of 100 and plus.  
  
For the coming week we got 4 solid levels to place limit order, two extremes and two mid-range levels all clearly visible in the chart below.  
  
I thought people were more engaged, active, posing great questions, observing and some expressed concern and dismissal about the whole deal, which is all good and fine.  
The fact is forums belong to public, and everyone are surly the master of their own judgement for their own good as to beak who and what is right or benefits them to follow or unfollow. All that is good as long as agendas are purely to only serve good.  
I am only sharing not teaching technicals, everything in this market has been already taught and shared for million times. Everyone does it in their own taste, style, flair and some tweaking which might fall in-line and suitable with some others, to trade together in a peaceful community. All systems and methods etc after X's and O's, comes down to how well you manage risk consistently in a structural manner... and that is a never-ending process of learning, practice and executions in the heat of the battle.  
Respect is all I have asked for and kindly reminding it.  
  
Looking forward to the new week and positive results.

Great post.  
I would love you to keep sharing with us your ideas and trading style. I have been around the markets for 13 years and have become a trader with steady and consistent profits, but there is always something new to learn in this business and I like you're approach to trading. I will still trade how I trade but its nice to try something different every now and again and I've been looking for a strategy for the 4H time frame.  
  
You are correct that there is nothing new in trading most of youtube is re-cycled garbage and it makes me sad when people turn up out of the blue and post in threads with arrogant attitudes saying how you are doing it wrong or you are showing nothing new.  
  
If it works and is profitable it does not matter how you trade the markets and if you want to share that information you should be able to do that too with out people being disrespectful.  
  
Keep posting as I find your trading approach interesting and you have a few nice fellow traders interested too. Hopefully we can keep a nice friendly thread going between us.  
  
Good luck to everyone this week.   
  
I like to prep my charts before looking at yours to see if I am getting it right. So far so good.

Trading is a single person's business.  
You do not need anyone to tell you how to trade.  
**You do not need anyone to accept your method or system**.  
You do not need authorization from anyone.  
All YOU need is **_YOUR COMMITMENT and DISCIPLINE._**  
  
It's all about **_YOU._**  
  
cpfleger 

without patience how can you be a trader?

A question, would you consider these levels to place limit orders? I like to go for the extreme ones.  
  
BTW, friendly thead.

> Week in review... We were blessed with five level to level trade opportunities to deal with in sideway action. FOMC/NFP week and no real breakout occurred... NFPs dust still is not settled tho, and that is why I kept my buy position open hoping for bullish continuation. Produced two winners +140/+80... one stop hit -30... one BE and one pending, in profit for 20 at zero risk as of now. Overall, a successful week with surpassing the weekly goal and beyond. However, as you all know some of us did not trigger on the buy trade and I was one of them....

Thank you for your efforts here! The 2nd of May there was a minor level which was not mentioned although the reaction was similar to that of the level we are trading right now - any reason for that?

I have been around the markets for 13 years and have become a trader with steady and consistent profits, but there is always something new to learn in this business and I like you're approach to trading. I will still trade how I trade but its nice to try something different every now and again and I've been looking for a strategy for the 4H time frame. You are correct that there is nothing new in trading most of youtube is re-cycled garbage and it makes me...

Hi furlan,  
The 9100 LV, to me is expired. Falls into my two weeks filter...  
.. but it's up to you... as long as you can test it and give up only 30 its worth a shot.  
  
I personally stay very discipline to that filter.

Hi Go,  
That is a minor level. That level was approached with a lot of heat from earlier bounce (the buy trade that I missed by a hair). on that on i treated as a one that wait & see how PA reacts to it which after a doji it shot up quickly. if it had hoovered around it for serval candles and I was able to get in at the right price up top I would have test it.   
There is a difference between testing a level at possible PAs exhaustion and at its peak. This was at its very peak.   
I don't do that often nor like it... I rather test and give up 30 to not mis a ride.

It closed the market at a quiet point in the range, so there should not be any large gaps. But in forex... who knows.

My own take is I am not sure if there will be a big gap, just a normal small one even though is come off of a big announcement's week.  
As far as the market is concerned there is not a whole lot of news for EU and dollar this week... I except more of sideway action in the same range as last two weeks. visiting peaks and valleys will work great for us or at least that's what I am hoping for... with that said I still think the NFP dust is not settled yet and a visit to peak at 10845 is a good possibility... but who knows, this beat is unpredictable.  
Stay flexible and trade at face value is what I value the most.

Many highs matched above call them like honey, so as you say they could maintain the range for a while and create liquidity, until they go to both sides of the range.

Dear Nadi!  
  
Thank you for your detailed pics with new levels - I've found they are similar to my seeing of your strategy, so I confirmed for myself that I understand your ideas right.  
  
I've visually backtested your strategy for several years + for 2009-2010 years also. I see absolutely more SLs then TPs, even not 3:1. But you said it was profitable for you for many years. Can I please ask you to describe your experience with this method more detailed? How deep were your drawdowns, how profitable in the long run etc.  
  
Thank you anyway for your work and sharing!

Your back test has flaws most likely. Validating some levels that are not, not extending your profit when it can etc.  
But I don't want to start argument about it here. That is why this is thread and forward trading will tell all. There are perhaps a lot of money/risk management skills that you have not input as well that will get you ahead, not to say technically is not sound.  
I recommend to not follow or trade big load if you have doubts.  
Not to mention for young life of this thread it has been profitable... sure its been a Sidway action, but once it gets in trending market it will also be profitable... but market 60-70% of times ranges, so statistically its sound and philosophically.

GM to all... woke up to a +103 bank and -30 stop and an new buy position triggered with a nice bounce. Sitting at +73 so far and its only Tuesday. This is a good start to a week, now can be more aggressive and room for risk to excel for larger profitability.

Got a first winning sell trade from 1.10883 level. I'm in the buy trade too. So glad I'm applying the same logic as you.

Similar to you, a short +99 and two long positions, one of them not closed in Sl by half a pip.  
What the market takes away from you sometimes, other times it gives you.

wow luck you not getting sting with the stop hit.  
The way I deal with this situation is to exit at BE when (1st buy trade 9705 LV) reaches back to the level unless it blows right by it, any hesitation I will exit it and drop the risk.

I understand that you place the lowest position in BE so as not to increase the risk with both?  
or look for the BE with both positions when it goes a little in favor?

I understand and done just in time.  
The first closed in BE and the second in BE as it is reaching 30 pips. Thank you for teaching me your risk management in your system.

A buy limit can become a sell limit if price goes through it and then goes back to that level?

If this current trade get to BE and drops, what is the next line of action: should there now be a sell limit at 0977ish or we wait for a swing low to be formed and then put a buy limit for when it returns. In the meantime we still keep the sell limits at 10486 and 10865.  
  
Have you ever had a loosing month with this strategy. I understand that it is inevitable that we have a loosing day/week  
  
I suggest that post 232 be added to the essential read.

I closed early, when it looked to me we were heading back to test resistance. I managed a bit better than BE. It may well head back up with CPI news in the next couple of hours , but for me now its sit on my hands time with EURUSD 

its all just one persons opinion....

Was stopped out by a pip before it reverses, unlucky. I have a question though, for this particular trade that hit my stop loss (breakeven), will you put a new buy limit if it tests that level again or wait for a clear lower low?

No immediate buy limit... and only again if there is a clear strong swing low.

I was stopped out at BE as well. It's fine its part of the game and keeps you safe in the long run. Unlucky and Lucky happens and it's a wash... in the end what counts is you doing the right thing and follow a set of structure that you can always fall back on otherwise you be all over the place.  
Discipline and staying the course is my edge. I have no problem with getting unlucky (as it has happened a lot last couple of weeks and you been the witness of it lol). This week atm sitting at +70 profit and its only Wednesdays, bring it on baby.  
  
Currently waiting to see if a new low swing will form to see where we at with levels and orders... for now the only two playable levels with sell limits are 1048 & 1086.  
  
I have some free time today I want to touch on an important Delima you might be facing I find it necessary since thread is developing with consistent followers.

If it had dropped with a real break out then yes that would have made that swing low a legit level to go short from, but now we notice is not and one maybe in the making a bit up top at 10000.  
Both sell limit are very much intact till two weeks filter takes them out.  
232 is in... good suggestion.  
  
Okey and now the main question; as I have been asked several times in different shape and form, so I will answer it once and for all and add it to first post.  
**"Have you ever had a losing month with this strategy?** " or etc in that nature.  
... sure, if and when I fuck up... if and when I try to outsmart the market and myself, get too wise for my own good... when I panic and let fear in to act desperate... when I become impatient with even results or mediocre results then fall off the pathway try to get too creative.  
but, when I stay even kill, stay the course, sticking to trading plan and style... ya, losing is far and away FOR ME.  
The fact is, I know my market philosophy and I trust it because I have sweat it out for many years of trading, and won't change it for the world, not based on ego but rather success... because is based on when and where Money was inserted and deserted, so, I test the market on those spots (peaks and valley, levels) to keep probability on my side with 3R+ hammer on top of it, for the possible lack of mediocre win rate. Keeping losses short, maximizing winners (30pips stops/BE, 3R+)  
  
folks, don't put much weight on any one to throw in bunch of personal stats for you on how successful they are or once were. instead, put weight on actual market sense and philosophy, a base, as to if it makes sense to you or not, is it market Savvy, is it based on some valuable market core or some xyz digital codes... more important of all, is it for you or not, does it fit your personality or not, does it fit your agenda and goals or not, is it at your speed or not.  
eg, even if I am a god trader, I would not be able to scalp for shit, bcz is just not me... I won't stare at charts for hours. Or short time trading or too long. Or too volatile crazy wild pair. Or high risky, high variance, and etc  
As a trader in my opinion, you got to be flexible adapt to what's successful and implement it, but at the same token it got to fit YOU.  
You will never get any number from me based on my results besides what you see in forward trading you witness here. My results have nothing to do with yours period.  
  
This post is for everybody, Thanks for the question, Jewel.

I would not do that. I follow the plan and stay away from those types of decisions where I can save a few but miss a ride.  
I know you made couple of bucks instead of even like me or rest of us. But if it had turned on you right there and ran to the moon, you would have sat there and beat yourself up for interfering. that is a bad feeling to create for yourself just to save a few winning tips vs abandoning your trading plan and discipline.  
You want to do the same thing all the time, staying solid so you have something to fall back on otherwise you are all over the place and relying solely on your PA predictions and you name it... that is all fine and dandy but you gotta be that good all the time. If you can do that then you stand correct and keep on. I know I can't.  
let is play its course for most times.  
  
Just my take brotha not putting you on the spot just pointing out details that make big differences... if it makes sense to you and others.

So why would we not want to place a buy limit at the 1.0946ish area right now?

Because you already took shot at it not long ago and failed, sure it faked us out but its not really shooting up either... need to be patient to let it fully develop a new swing low, it still looks like a bounce... need a full loop round to develop and approach it again to take shot at again.  
stay patient.

Really looking forward to how tradable buy and sell limit levels will develop from within the marked area.  
Again is there a set number of pips between a buy and sell limit you use as filter?  
  
Thank you very much

No, just when a valid level is formed is good to go.  
I know the concern comes from too jammed up PA... but price can take off from any level.

Thanks for the reply. Can I check if it is a valid sell (10031) and buy (9661) as these are mid-range valleys/peaks I feel. Or if it’s not, why is it not a valid level?

How is that a Peak or Valley? (blue circle) I marked it off your chart  
its not, that is nothing but a wick in a continuation... so therefore like we have explained earlier right above be patient for new swing low to form.  
wicks are nothing if they are not in a essential location like peaks and valleys. does that mean price will not react to it? no, price reacts to a lot of things for reasons sometimes or something that we don't know anything about, should we trade all of them!!! in that case you can open trade anywhere and everywhere.  
you want some kind of probability with you.

Then may I ask why you consider this as a valid Peak in the circle? It does not break the previous swing high (10866) but you still considered this as a level.

That is clearly valid... your got a high or Peak (blue circle) then price made a clear V and the square box is a valid trade.

Why did you consider this as a valid level then, since there was no clear low formed on that candle and u set a buy limit order as shown from your square box. Sorry for asking a lot of questions as I do not get the mid ranges valleys/peaks.  
  
I thought this was a valid sell (2nd image) because of the V shape formed as well similar to this (1st image) which caused my confusion. Hope you can enlighten me thanks ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

That is clearly a low after price push off long!!! are you just asking questions to ask questions or to just not putting mind behind it.  
the 2nd image I already explained to you... the origin is nothing but a wick in a continuation, there is no V there, otherwise every pullback is a V. there is no level formed there yet.. did we sell from there!! I have not even put a level there yet, let alone selling.   
a pullback and resume sets a level.  
you need to understand the difference between a wick and a push off or a wick with continuation.  
  
This is very simple my friend. please do the due diligent, with all due respect. if this is your thing read the 1st post and all other important posts a few times and study the chart for hours and hours.  
  
GL... bcz right now you need a lot of it, not to be harsh.

Okey so now we have a new level 10024 is in play I already got a sell limit order. I also decided to take one more shot at 9410 after the drop for now missed my order by couple of pips. Hence the drop push off validates the new swing low level at 10024.

Morning guys... got hit with a stop on 9404 buy position. Looks like its breaking out with a bear move from a month long sideway action. So, we have only long aways sell limits, waiting game begins to see how PA develops to give us new levels from current action.  
It starts with price pullbacks which will define valley to put a Buy limit then double top or N action to go short with sell limit.  
  
Price is right at 9110 (old LV) that one as you all should know by now it's a filter for me (2w).

Two recommendations;  
* Don't use indicators to define your levels, you will have lines everywhere crowds your chart way too much, keeps you out of touch... learn to train your eyes to see it yourself and draw it. Not to mention if you are following the thread most of levels from an indicator is filtered. so you be trading not based on what we do here.  
* Don't go below H4 timeframe. Its noise and you have to watch dog the chart every 15 min or hour. again, that's not what we do here.  
and if I have to use one more recommendation that would be to ignore post 262, with all due respect.  
  
But it's all entirely up to you.

Right… have today installed MT5 iOS app to see if I can trade this method with iPhone while traveling (will be in Austria & Italy next 2 weeks). Only my second trade using this approach &, as I do not have an MT5 broker, all in Sim mode. I’m Long from just below my lowest level as price so often tags the 100 / BRN levels; as it’s Friday & trade has reached +20 or so, will move stop to b/e soon & def close position for weekend.  
  
Thanks for thread, nfx ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f64f.png?v=15.1).  
  
Edit: stopped @ b/E+ / great weekends everyone.

9100 LV falls into my 2 weeks (2W) filter.   
However, if you feel comfortable to give up 30 to test it, it's all good. This level is still in the sideway bracket so it may not be all that bad of a trade, I don't mind it.

Alright guys I decided to take a stab at 9100 level even though it falls to my 2W filter. I see price reacting to it for several candles and the level is still within bracket I will make a audible and go for it... it's worth a shot.

I am always intriqued at how people determine levels the way you do! When I look at a chart it just seems like so many levels. So I shall be following closely and learning more. Any tips on how you spot levels?

Goodmorning, so the none signal sell trade did not work out but I lost only 12 pips on that one moved the stops up before going to bed after a little cushion it gave.  
overall, a dumb trade not within the plan but I was up +40 and this probably was the only chance to get me back to my weekly goal... still finishing the week with +30.  
I consider this week a survival one... trades were against market will and that's when power of 3R comes handy, one win covers 3 losses, with 25%-win rate you breakeven.  
I am done for the week all orders removed.  
  
Week is winding down, market heading south, dollar strengthening, bracket broken and will see how it shapes up. for now, no buy limits, sell limits far and away.  
what's next! price will halt makes a pullback and you get yourself a Valley that's a level to go long... after pullback it may resume, and the resume point becomes your peak that's a level to go short on next visit (double top) that's how you will get in this bear move. 9310 is the closest to it atm.  
  
Possible scenarios;  
* Price pulls back and gets stuck in a sideway action you will make ton of money.  
* Price pulls back but gets in choppy action, you will BE for most parts.  
* Price pulls back gives you double top and shoots down you will make money and possibly continue to stay in the trend, (next phase I will show you, if still here)  
* Price pulls back and resumes and breaks the valley hard every time you will lose 30 every time... but if shows slightest reaction/bounce you still might get away with BE results at times.  
so, that's the way it goes.  
  
one thing is for certain, price will halt, price will pullback... and markets overall sideways 2/3 of times. Based on those facts I know I can make money and not lose money, IF I can keep myself in check. So, it comes down to YOU.  
  
Have a wonderful weekend folks.

if its not giving me the 3R I initially have the target at next level but _**if i see price is reacting to this mediocre level and not breaking through it then i just bank**_ , but i give it a chance to break it. for example on the current short trade i got my tp at bottom level and not at the immediate one that is about 70 pips.  
  
Please do you have specific price action strategy to determine if price is reacting to or breaking a mediocre level? Do you sometimes go down to the lower time frames eg H1 to see this reactions? I guess it may also help to explain how to remain with the trend in case one gets lucky  
  
many thanks for your time

I never go to lower time frame if anything I go up.  
No specific PA strategy... it either breaks the level hard or reacts to it with a hesitation or bounce. I will at times give it the chance for the hard break, that's all.  
Now...  
1\. If level is short of my 3R, I hold for the break to bank at next level for 3R. (Like on the buy trade this past week)  
2\. If level satisfies 3Rs but it's in a sideway action I bank at the quickest hesitation. (like the sell trade mid this week for 103)  
3\. If level is in the trending mood PA stepping, I will be more tolerable, take the hard break more seriously to maximize on possible trend.  
... the 3rd scenario is something we have not seen yet but PA looks to be trending bear now... so if we are able to get on this on a pullback double top.. we will look for bottom hard break for trend continuation. (chart below)  
The probability is higher on trending PA for continuation level to be broken, especially early stages of the Trend.  
It's just all commonsense to me more than anything else instead of PA predicting, reading etc,... trend can stop at any time... we just won't know. But there are early stages when its ripe and exhaustion time when near winding down... both are very visible in the charts.  
Now, all of that depends on my Risk Management too... where I am at that time of the week... down two stops, even, up, killing it etc  
Trading is not all clean cut... it's all about the buck in the end more than the Xs and Os.  
  
I hope it helps.

90% of times when price breaks the Level hard your stop is hit... but when it does not and resumes back in your favor it can turn into a winner or breakeven... like the sell trade we had late last week (red circle).. I end up BE that one but some of you even banked 30-40 pips.  
stop survived a hard break on that one, which traveled about 26 pips.

@Nadi: Could you please clarify when a peak or valley is confirmed for you? Does it need to be a "swing point" or any minimum height in pips? Would you consider 1.0848 as valley?

When money is inserted and deserted...  
Price halt and take off, the origin becomes a Level... most times are Valleys and Peaks and at times mid-range levels.  
  
Please read the 1st post and important posts.

I see again and very eagerly we have another Level indicator posted here.  
As I said before, learn to train your eyes to see it yourself and to draw it yourself and not depend on xyz to all that for you. This way you be more engaged with price and chart, builds muscle memory, becomes second nature.  
Level that is broken is dead and that is what this whatever indicator or most other don't show and therefore your chart is full of lines, just be aware of which one to filter if you chose to not listen to me and want to use it.

Based on the shaded H4 candle, the wick in my case is more than 10 pips, so the 2/3rd rule applies. Are we to add 1/3 or 2/3 to the low to get the level for buy limit?

On this one I went inward 2/3... when not a lot of wicks or no wick to work with just go inward 5-10 pips making sure still got 20 pips to the 30 mark and inside enough to not miss the trigger.  
It happened couple of times last week and cost me to miss big gains. I rather get triggered get sting with Stops then not trigger and miss a big ride.

Levels placed like yours.  
The buy level coincides with the opening of the day, one more confluence.

Okey guys, some game planning ahead on how to manage when in a trend play.  
From here on if we get on any sell trade that does fall big you want to bank but leave some of the position open... I Bank & Keep **(KB 80/20)**  
... banking 100+ for 80% and 20% of the position to run... If you catch a big trend let's say around 1000 pips... that equal to 6-7 of stop size.  
and if trending and stepping, you very well could be in multiple of it... now you are a playaa, maximizing the trend, stress free, at ease, risk free... you already have got your main chunk.  
Talking ahead this may not happen but if does you are planned for it. Being a few steps ahead helps you make _in-the-moment_ decisions with full clarity.  
I can care or less about Trend... but if it's there this is how I would play it.

That level could get crush like a pumpkin pie... but got be tested.  
The larger the pullback the better chance of level to hold... this pullback is a little one for now compared to the drop.  
remains to be seen...

Here is my chart to start the week with levels and orders for now.  
  
Also, on obvious points where money inserted... the reason so far price pushed bear so nicely and orderly. (red Circles)

**Patience...**  
I know some of you see the wick, it looks so ripe for a drop to at least test the Valley... and you're sitting there tempted to get on this to either grab it for a quick gain or possibly be in this ride for a big drop.  
But, in reality...  
This pullback is not fully developed yet, and it could still very well reach up higher it could even be a bounce to the moon... noting is set yet.  
sit on your hands let it develop, stay patience, stay with your structure (whatever it is that you do)... stick to your plan... practice discipline... **stay the course.**  
Rides and bounces etc are everywhere... how you win with it is another story... your structure is your edge... you wanna win based on something that you can fall back on if it doesn't pan out to be the way it should've could've...  
_Structure and Risk Management_ is first and everything else 2nd the way I approach it.... you are the master or your boat tho.  
  
I see things live and find it necessary to point out, that's all... no intention to lecture by any means.

now is when many indicators cross and give inputs, but I prefer to sit on my hands and wait for the inputs of the system, it gives us the advantage of entering early and good liquidity taking points.

Can you please point out which specific H4 candle close that confirmed this particular setup?  
If EU does not trade above the current high of 1.09046, does it imply that we have a sell limit at 1.08946 after 20:00 H4 server time candle close?

Buy limit triggered as the level got broken hard, stop is alive still maybe hit may not, remain to be seen.  
what you don't want to do is to interfere with it, let it play its course.

How do you feel about scaling out on stops - say taking off 33% of the trade every 10 pips against your trade?

Close of the highlighted candles are the signals. Just to be sure

That would be a disaster, so the answer is no. This stop is very small and a lot of times is hit before you get to it... A lot of times just the reaction and bounce to the level travels 10-15 pips negative, so every time you would be in a winner for less amount.  
This is how you deal with stops... you lick your wound and move on to the next trade. It's part of the game.

No.  
No candle is a "signal"...   
The measurement of the level point is what we use it for. H/L of the wick to its close.  
You are making this way to complicated for yourself my friend... you see a bottom or top you draw a line!! if there is a wick you do accordingly as I have explained if there is no wick you go inward 5-10 pips.

Just dislike the post so you don't see it.  
There always will be one, and there is full of them here at FF and quite frankly everywhere in life... so best is to not waste time and be distracted.

No, price take off from low is not that much yet, need more loop, need more time...

I'm not in it. Nadi said that this had not developed into a level yet.

That level wasn't fully developed.  
A very weak level and price has broken bullish structure and momentum is building up to the down side the sell limits should be stronger trades.

nadi-fx. Ok. Is the selection of a level (e.g in the case a LL) a discretionary decision or are there rules associated with when to apply a level or not? For example do you use the MACD to assist with the decision to apply a level or not? Many thanks.

But I will like to ask Nadi, Is there a level around 8410 for a sell limit?

This was not a Level, because;  
*Not enough take off from LL!...  
I marked your own image... need a larger take off and loop around... especially considering the magnitude of this bear move.

This should answer all your current questions about LV.  
  
The first image; price halt and continuation... that halt is just a part of the price continuation... not large enough, not long enough...  
translates to; not enough bull money inserted in order to be taken seriously. so, the LL is not level, but the peak of that small move is a Level... bcz new money did insert there to push it down further... that point is to be taken seriously.  
  
2nd image... the pullback and the resume both are fine for levels, the is price take off on both pullback and resumes.  
  
I hope it helps... just think of it; where money has showed up to push the price from any price halt!!... then, you got yourself a level there and must be tested on the next visit... some works some don't... because simply we do not know how much was inserted and if those orders still stand there later on, all we know at some point and time there was action there, that's it. But is good enough to make money from such little info anyways.  
We are served with 2nd hand info as retail traders, always remember that.  
... to counter such vulnerability, is the reason for 3R since the win rate will not be significantly high. you can hit 25% and be even money... any more than that you're profiting... but it might come and take in runs... like you will have a few losses in a row or same with wins... but its the loss one that you need to bear through, stick with it and etc, to prevail in the end and make money.

ok, I understand the pattern(s) you have drawn. The interpretation of whether a level is formed at the lower low (in your diagram) appears to be the magnitude of the retracement, or as you call it “the take off”. My question remains… is the determination of the magnitude of the retracement from the low a discretionary decision? Or, is there a repeatable quantitative method to confirm the take off has a high probability of creating a new level? As an example, if the takeoff from the low was greater than xx% (50%, 61.8% etc) of the downward move. Thanks.

The reason I hesitate to use the name Retracements is because quickly gets related to Fib levels and that is not what I want here.  
I use the Take-Off bcz after the point of price halt and bounce I like to see a significant take-off and the continuation of it for some time. So, within next a few candles I need to see at least one striking one. A slow pullback means it just profit taking is taking place... a sharper pullback means profit taking + new money is coming in, now that's something I can bank on when it revisits that area again. It's like a solid wall in place and price on the revisit if not as strong will bounce off of it.  
So, No there is no discretionary decision... however as an experience trader I could tell based on strength of this current bear move that little retrace was not the highest probability level to go long from, by just looking at it. Therefore, I have come to conclusion as to how to separate/distinguish retracements... initial take off or speed or bounce or etc needs to be visible to me to validate any level... I need to see that somewhere in the first wall of the retracements.  
I don't use fib, I don't use any indicator, I don't use set of number of pips, I don't make decisions off the cuff either.  
  
I hope it helps.

ok, I get it… however, the description you use… need to see a “significant” takeoff and a continuation of it for “some time” means it is discretionary… in other words, the determination of what is “significant” and “some time” will differ among traders. I am not saying that is a bad thing… it is what it is… discretionary, based on a trader’s personal understanding and experience in the market. The opposite of discretionary is rules-based (which can usually be coded), however for this portion of your system, rules-based doesn’t apply. Not an issue for me, but needed the clarification.

Of course, can't code it... but it does not mean it's discretionary.  
The day you can code something for 100% perfection is your end in this market, so forget coding talks here lol.  
  
A pullback consists of a few candles on the initial leg... on those you need to see at least one of them to show strength and hold etc, (that is speed and time) ... there is nothing discretionary about that, it's very visible in the chart unless one wants to make it complicated.

Using your description I would now place a buy limit at around the 1.0761 level.... do you agree?

The current tradable levels on my chart:  
  
1.10024  
1.09314  
1.08970  
1.08440  
1.07650  
  
this being a trend week, we expect to see a tradable range next week. I may be wrong

don't get too fixated on the exact number bcz every broker is off a bit here and there... There is hardly any wick on this one, so you just go inward 5-10 pips... as long as you leave 20 pips from LL to the stop.

The levels are all correct.

Good morning nadi-fx,  
  
Just read through your excellent thread and it reads very precise and well thought out.  
Also love the idea of sticking to 4hour timeframe and one pair only EUR_USD.  
  
I must also admit I too do not take that much notice of minor news events as I believe most of these events are already built into the charts.  
  
I just have one question answering if you wouldn't mind and that is in relation to the MACD indicator.  
This you clearly have on your charts yet from your post above you do not seem to support it's use?  
  
Maybe I have missed something, this is certainly not a criticism just a genuine question if you would be so kind.  
  
Very best regards,

Hi DT... that post stand correct the Mac D has no roll in what i do what so ever, it is a super lagging indicator of all.  
I have just for a quick look to see if the PA is up or down in H4, that's all. For most of my daytime I check the chart on my phone, so this gives me that quick look.

It has done 30+ pips and you did not mention BE. Do you consider it too early to place on BE?

No need to wait I tell ya now,  
Whipsaw whiplash fake outs... thats not out of Woods  
The purpose of BE is to not play scared money... is to not be hit with 30 when price has given you 40+ pips and sometime then loops around and get you.

I know you mentioned that you treat each trade individually but I want to ask if the current buy trade TP is triggered, the 8460 Sell order SL would definitely be hit first.  
  
Would it be better to close the buy trade or take partial profits even if it’s not 3R yet the moment the sell order is triggered?

okey guys pros and cons here...  
If you BE this one you might feel good right now bcz you took a shot didn't pan out and you got away with it at no cost, which is good.  
If you are still in it like me you are risking your stop to be taken out, took a shot didn't work and will pay the price.  
  
IF this turns around and resumes the bounce to take off for a good profit or heavy one, then the upside worth more than the downside.  
  
I personally don't think about any of that, "what could happen"... I just stick to what I do every time, and that is; to play it the same every time, which is, if the position has not matured, I stick with it and gladly accept the outcome, whether is the SL or TP.

The beast is at work... look at what it's doing lol... I have seen it so many times, lived and breath it.  
that's why I have a set of structure and stick to it for most part. Thats the only thing I can rely to fall back on, track record to go by.  
But if I do different thing every time than I be all over the place and cannot count of any track record.  
Staying discipline with one thing eliminates a lot of things, most nonsense that costs nothing but losses after losses... I can go on and on in this particular part.  
  
It's a choice, and that's what it comes down to in the end, individually as a Trader.

Nadi-fx, please just another clarification. with the 0826 and 0844 levels so close, do we put sell limits on both of them or is there modification in this case?

When too close like this just pick one or test both... I would just go with the farthest one which is the 8440... just the reaction to 8240 could travel to 8440 so mind as well get triggered with the deepest one.

Is it required that the H4 candle should close above the 30 pip line to be able to move stop to BE  
And again should the trade survives, is the proposed TP at 8970?

Morning to all and coffee time...  
I see the beast is still at work, only if NY was thinking bull we would have been out of the woods... but seems like the level is resisting to break.  
I am still in this trade... its the first and only trade of the week so I don't mind with the stop hit verses not losing out on this ride if its meant to happen, might be the only chance of profitability this week who knows.

Since we were about 30 pips in profit theoretically we should have moved SL to BE and therefore now the trade should have been close, right?

I don't want to set a firm number, I have said 30-40 pips but along with a strong candle to be seen before moving SL to BE. The point is to not move the stop to BE when price still not giving it a strong bounce away from the LV and still playing around it like this one at the moment.  
TP, yes you want to protect the 3R, unless its really not happening at some point... but lets say its at 60-70 pips with 1-2 day to go in the week its wise to bank some to save the week close to 100 goal.

Well in my structure I have said 30-40... the gain never saw the 40, nor showed any strong or sustain bull momentum.  
But if you have moved it to BE and out of the trade it's all good... the survival of this trade is 50/50 at best.  
I don't sweat stop hits... I rather give my trade all the chances it needs to prevail and not jump the gun on eliminating it.

Ok guys look at the two circled spots in the chart... what's the difference between the two?  
You all are asking a lot of questions about the BE and looking for something super firm and that's not how trading work.. that is why I am not all for coding/EA... so let's hear your input or answers.  
We were in that trade as well live and BE that one, but I moved my stop to BE when?

I understand the close, but don't get fixated on the close so much but rather the strong very sustain bull move away from LV and the after math, which is a halt and reject to go up further the look alike of a PB peak for a trend resume... now in that case I will move my SL to BE to be safe from not giving up a 30 on top of losing out on 60-70 gain!  
  
Now the case on the 2nd circle is not the same is it... we never had the strong candle to solidify the strong bounce in the first place and that's where it ends.

The current tradable levels on my chart:  
1.08970  
1.08440  
1.07935  
1.07504  
  
Was not quite sure what to make of the 1.0712 buy level from where we have the current bounce and if 1.0750 is a sell level already.

I agree with you on the levels, except for the sale of 1.07504 I see it very close to the price and not yet as a level, although it can work perfectly with the movement so strong and without retracement that there has been.

The 0705 is a level and if it was not Friday right before closing hours I would have already been in this buy position now.  
The 750 surely is a level to go short from.  
As soon as market opens depending on where price open is I will place my orders on these levels.

It's clear, initial bounce is solid two bold take-off candles, nice enough loop, and it is at the later stages of the trend to say the least... so solid to be tested.

If we are looking at the highlighted candle, the low is 0707 and by the rules let say we add 5pips that comes to 0712. So I still don't understand the 0705 as entry for buy limit.   
Thank you for your time

Yes that be correct if we were in it already... now that we are not you can take into account the new wick on the 2nd bounce and last close. (blue box shows)  
  
This is just a rare case like this... otherwise is exactly how you measured it.

just 2 sell limits left; 1.07935 and 1.07500  
  
Did the shaded H4 candle qualify for placement of a buy limit at 1.0680 ish? I think it does but I missed it somehow ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f605.png?v=15.1)

I did place a purchase, but the price continues like a bearish rocket, with almost no retrocement to high levels with sales.

A breather that gives the price, for the moment in favor of the sale of 1.07520, reaching 29.9 pips in favor, we will see if it continues, although today is already Friday...  
You never know where a retracement can occur, but in a strong downtrend like the one we have seen it is dangerous to be ahead of the train with purchases (4 stoploss in a row), perhaps one possibility is to wait for the price to relax to go against it of the trend.

On Friday I closed the operation with a x1.5, since when carrying several SL I prefer to approach a 0 loss, and wait for new opportunities. New levels this week. Sell at 1.07740 and buy at 1.06390.  
  
I hope all is well nadi-fx, what do you think?

Both level are correct... Price look to be correcting a bit after 3 weeks 450 pips drop... maybe getting new levels in between too.  
It's all good bud good luck this week.

Thats a good sell. I missed putting sell limit on that level but did bank 57pips on that level on buy trade.

I see the thread quiet, and I can understand, there is no bling bling her nor should be.  
Okey so here is the story of what's happening, it is nothing short of what always happens... price makes a run then corrects for a while then makes a run corrects and so on and on...  
This time around it was a bit unfortunate since it did not give us a chance to get on ride of 450pips drop, normally it does at least once or twice to benefit from trend moves as well. This was one of the nicest clean-cut runs in some time, pullback drop pullback drop giving no DB/DT.  
what I like to hit home is this now... during the run which lasted about 3 weeks we were hit with 5 stops in a row total of -150pip... now what it seems to be is a sideway action which has already given us 3 signals, all winners... none of them were even full 3R and still has wiped all the losses, and the correction has just started... in is inside a 150 pips range up and down, how long it will last who knows... take it at face value and trade the heck out of it.  
The key is, _Patience, Staying The Course,_ just like any other successful trading style or life in general. Jumping the gun or second guessing or moving from systems to systems and else does nothing but damage and chaos to your trading career.  
Sure, you did not make money in 3 weeks, and you lost some on top of it... but trading is not clean cut, market is not clean cut, it's made of lots of twist and turns... There is not a trading method that does not go through up and downs, good runs and bad runs etc,... it all averages out in the end, but that is, **IF** you stay discipline, trust the process and stick with it, that is your only edge in this market.  
_The point is how you handle the Bear time and how you maximize the Bull time._  
When this correction lasts for couple of weeks you will make ton of money, it will recover all lost times and plenty more... but **IF** you did not go crazy during the down time, giving up more than you should have and else.  
  
Anyways I hope it makes sense.

I agree that the price has not given us any opportunity to rise in the downtrend in some retracement, added that it has been a strong fall, it has caused the sum of several losses, but if that is one of the worst possible scenarios, and even Thus the losses are recoverable with a positive operation or managing some operations with lower R:R...,  
One question, nadi-fx, how did you manage the accumulation of 57 pips, did you place it in BE and when the price returned, did you take it out in BE, or did you close the trade with a risk of less than x3? to recover part of the previously accumulated losses.

I never moved the stop to BE and just closed it right at the reverse level for less than 3R. Need to recover from some of the losses.

You mean like this... why would you exit on such a great trend play jackinthebox  
look I see now then people come in here and present something else and some of your praise it... ok fine  
There are many ways to skin a cat... stick to what we do here... but if you all want more than what I have presented then let me know, I got four different entries for every phase of the market movement... show your interest then I make the effort to show you how you can profit or play the price from every step.

This is a great system as it identifies a very important point/area. Big thanks to nadi-fx for pointing this out!  
But you guys/gals are **predicting** a reversal instead of **reacting** to what the market does

you can always adjust to your own needs and experience what to do when price is around h4 level.  
if you are waiting for price**reaction** around h4 level, then one has to go to the lower time frame something like m5 to look for that.

You are right in what you say, but to react to the price you have to be in front of the screen, in principle the system is to place an order and play with the distance of the stop and the ratio.

Hi Nadi,  
  
Your system looks great, very mechanical and unambiguous which I love!   
  
I'm curious if you recall your highest amount of consecutive losses to date? Don't suppose you have an approximate win rate? My apologies if this has been answered in previous pages, I'm just working my way through them now. I look forward to joining you next week.  
  
Have a great weekend.

I am going to make some changes to the 1st post regards to trade structures for the sake of this thread to make it safer.  
Limit order types of trading is not for everyone.

So first post is revised...  
The big change is we got confirmation now before entering versus none before.  
in detail: you will wait for H1 candle rejection at the level before taking position.. therefore, replacing Limit orders with Stop orders  
Thats it.  
Please read the 1st post.

I ended up deciding to open a new thread for the changes. The changes differ, and it's better to have its own place. I trade both ways using limit orders and go for it without confirmation when I see fit, and distinguishing between was just too much of a task to explain and display. The other thread will serve as a safer way to trade, and I thought it would fit for more people, so that is why I will be active there and keep that thread going.  
If you are interested, visit that other thread called " Level in Level out 2.0."  
  
Cheers.

I have finished reading your two threads, sorry, I think your trading system has been a failure so far. Even if you started a new thread "Level in Level out 2.0", it's useless. The fact is that you are also exploring and constantly being stopped out. A 3R is just a beautiful imagination!
