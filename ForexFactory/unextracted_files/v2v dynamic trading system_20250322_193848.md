**The definition of technologies used inside this system...**  
  
☛ **The VWAP bands on this system**  
  
Using an average true range/average range or an average daily range, the VWAP bands (shifted from the main line) are calculated with statistical z-scores. The VWAP calculation is primarily based on the lecture by Dr. Paul Levine (R.I.P.) on the MIDAS system.  
  
A statistical z-score value can be injected into an algorithm or included in an equation for predicting trend-end probabilities. The vertical line guides on the chart (from & to) are used for plotting price inflection points or session ranges (4-hour, daily, weekly, and monthly or 8-hour or 24-hour market range). The setup included a feature that can switch from MVWAP (MA-based VWAP ) to classic VWAP. MA (Moving Average) is a non-lag Hull MA calculated using Fulk's Matulich for T3-based MA. As a result, I call it T3-HMA.  
  
As part of the system, linear, volume-weighted MAs are applied (but only some of them, as the rest use adaptive calculations with Price) before adding the DSMA filter (Deviation-Scaled MAs by John F. Ehlers). Then, the MA's period calculation within the system is calculated/assigned dynamically based on the current Dominant Cycle Period.  
  
  
☛ **Dynamic Zones by Leo Zamansky, Ph.D. and David Stendahl**  
  
The Dynamic Zone indicator elaborately shows how it solves common trading complications. An oscillator is a valuable technical analysis tool employed in aggressive investment strategies to capitalize on market trends. This approach to investing adheres to a straightforward, logic-based methodology - It only enters the market when an oscillator has moved far above or below traditional trading levels. However, these indicator-driven systems cannot evolve with the market because they use fixed buy and sell zones. Traders typically use one set of buy and sell zones for a bull market and substantially different zones for a bear market.  
  
Herein lie the complications. Once traders begin introducing their market opinions into trading equations, they negate the system's mechanical nature by changing the zones. The objective is to have a system automatically define its buy and sell zones and thereby profitably trade in any market- bull or bear. Dynamic Zones present a dynamic solution to the limitations of fixed buy and sell zones in any indicator-driven system.  
  
  
☛ **Jurik filter ─ phase and smoothing**  
  
JMA (Jurik Research Moving Average) phase and smoothing calculation. Have you noticed how moving averages add some lag (delay) to your signals, especially when price gaps are up or down in a substantial move, and you are waiting for your moving average to catch up? Wait no more! JMA eliminates these complications forever and gives you the benefits of both worlds: low lag and smooth lines.  
  
Ideally, for instance, a filtered signal should be smooth and lag-free. Lag causes delays in your trades, and increasing lag in your indicators typically results in lower profits. In other words, latecomers get what's left on the table after the feast has already begun. The JMA's improved timing and smoothness will astound you.  
JMA is a powerful adaptive tracker that can smooth time series data with minimal lag, no overshoots, and no oscillations. The algorithm is stable and avoids the complexities of neural networks. JMA delivers the most reliable all-around performance for smoothness, accuracy, and timeliness.  
  
  
☛ **Best Formula: Using Average Price Bar ( APB )**  
  
Average Price Bars (APBs) more accurately represent the current market by minimizing fluctuations in nominal price action, often referred to as the “choppiness” of current High, Low, and Close price action. In other words, APBs eliminate the noise of price distortion.  
  
  
☛ **haDelta (Heiken Ashi - Delta)**  
  
haDelta is a simple formula originally developed and published by Mr. Dan Valcu. The idea behind haDelta is to quantify HA candles. One can measure momentum, which is very important when you use haDelta for reversals. It measures the difference between haClose and haOpen. Caution: High sensitivity if used.  
  
  
☛ **Uses Hull MA (by Allan Hull), but this one is a variation from Low lag to zero lag.**  
  
Various moving averages exist, with the Simple Moving Average (SMA) being the most basic. However, the SMA suffers from a significant lag in price movements. To address this issue, the Exponential and Weighted Moving Averages were introduced, which focus more on recent data for better accuracy. Allan Hull developed the Hull Moving Average (HMA), A remarkably fast and seamless technique that practically eliminates delays while also improving smoothness at the same time. The dynamic MyRSI with NET, combined with T3 Hull MA variation, Jurik filters, and phase & smoothing, ultimately achieves optimal lag elimination for more precise results.  
  
  
☛ **Ehler's Deviation-Scaled Moving Average ( DSMA )**  
  
The Deviation-Scaled Moving Average (DSMA) is an innovative data-smoothing technique introduced by John Ehlers in the July 2018 issue of TASC magazine. The DSMA functions as an exponential moving average with a dynamic smoothing coefficient, which adapts based on the magnitude of price changes. By utilizing the standard deviation from the mean to measure this magnitude, the DSMA provides substantial data smoothing, even when price changes are small, while swiftly adapting to these changes. As a result, this indicator offers minimal computational lag and rapid adaptation to price variations, making it an effective tool for identifying trends and potential trading opportunities.  
  
  
☛ **Vertical Horizontal Filter ( VHF )**  
  
The Vertical Horizontal Filter (VHF), developed by Adam White, is a valuable tool for identifying trending and ranging markets. Similar to the ADX in the Directional Movement System, the VHF evaluates the degree of trend activity, allowing traders to use trend indicators in trending markets and momentum indicators in ranging markets. By effectively differentiating between these market conditions, the Vertical Horizontal Filter facilitates more accurate and informed decision-making when employing various trading strategies.  
  
  
☛ **Dominant Cycle Period ( DCP )**  
  
The DCP-generated value is being used as a dynamic Period parameter value (for dynamic MyNET).  
Based on Homodyne Discriminator by John F. Ehlers, Rocket Science for Traders. This type of algorithm exhibits superior performance in a low signal-to-noise environment.  
  
  
☛ **Linear Momentum ─ a.k.a. MomenTicks**  
  
Linear momentum is defined as the product of a system's mass multiplied by its velocity. In symbols, linear momentum is expressed as p = mv. Momentum is directly proportional to the object's mass and velocity. Thus, the greater an object's mass or the greater its velocity, the greater its momentum.  
  
  
☛ **My NET ( Noise Elimination Technology )**  
  
As a technical indicator, My NET employs Kendall correlation to eliminate nonlinear noise. However, the application of additional filters in this system results in a significantly less noisy plot than RSI.  
  
The NET is a modified version of the RocketRSI Relative Strength Index. A one-bar close price difference is calculated as the ratio between their absolute values and the sum of the recent one-bar close price differences.  
  
  
☛ **Elegant Osci**  
  
In a unique update for dynamic MyNET with the SmoothStep function, "An Elegant Oscillator: Inverse Fisher Transform Redux," author John Ehlers (At TASC Magazine article - February 2022) explains how he uses the inverse Fisher transform to create an indicator he calls the elegant oscillator.  
First, he describes the Fisher transform before explaining the inverse Fisher transform, which provides normalization by dividing the root mean square (RMS) value into the waveform.  
  
The elegant oscillator can spot reversion-to-the-mean opportunities with improved timing capabilities.  
  
  
☛ **Momentum Deviation**  
  
This is another variation of a standard deviation as it got embedded with dynamic MyNET  
\- it uses the momentum of price (instead of price itself) for calculation  
\- It is calculated in a way that it takes minimal CPU load  
\- As far as values are concerned, it is similar to standard deviation. It is the same as a standard deviation -it can calculate the deviation of anything.  
  
  
☛ **The ADX**  
  
ADX is a popular indicator whose elaborated form is the Average Directional Movement. Traders rely on this indicator to assess the strength of the trend. However, using the traditional ADX requires a perfect understanding of the highs and lows of the market. To make things easier, the developers have created the ADXm Indicator.  
  
dynamic MyNET uses the ADXm algorithm.  
  
  
☛ **The Linear Regression-adjusted Quantitative Qualitative Estimation double**  
  
TASC magazine's August 2022 issue featured another variant of a moving average called “The Linear Regression-Adjusted Exponential Moving Average." Author Vitali Apirine presents a technique called the linear regression-adjusted exponential moving average (LRAdj EMA) to combine a linear regression indicator with an EMA. The indicator can be used to help define turning points while filtering price movement. The LRAdj EMA can be applied in combination with a traditional exponential moving average of the same length to facilitate trend identification.  
  
  
☛ **Hurst Exponent with NET (a variation) -_inside dynamic MyNET_**  
  
In the 1970s, an American engineer called JM Hurst published a theory about why financial markets move in the way they do. The theory was the result of many years of research on powerful mainframe computers, and it became known as Hurst’s Cyclic Theory. Hurst claimed a 90% success rate in trading based on his theory, and yet the theory has remained largely undiscovered and often misunderstood.  
  
The Hurst Exponent is used as a measure of the long-term memory of time series. It relates to the autocorrelations of the time series and the rate at which these decrease as the lag between pairs of values increases. Studies involving the Hurst exponent were originally developed in hydrology for the practical matter of determining optimum dam sizing for the Nile River's volatile rain and drought conditions that had been observed over a long period. The name "Hurst exponent," or "Hurst coefficient," derives from Harold Edwin Hurst (1880 - 1978), who was the lead researcher in these studies; the use of the standard notation H for the coefficient also relates to his name.  
  
The Hurst exponent is referred to as the "index of dependence" or "index of long-range dependence." It quantifies the relative tendency of a time series either to regress strongly to the mean or to cluster in a direction.  
  
A value of H in the range 0.5 - 1 indicates a time series with long-term positive autocorrelation, meaning that a high value in the series will probably be followed by another high value and that the values a long time into the future will also tend to be high.  
  
A value of H in the range of 0 to 0.5 indicates that a time series exhibits long-term switching between high and low values in adjacent pairs. This means that a high value is likely to be followed by a low value, and the value after that is expected to be high, with this pattern of switching between high and low values persisting for a long time.  
  
A value of H = 0.5 can indicate a completely uncorrelated series, but it is the value applicable to series for which the autocorrelations at short time lags can be positive or negative but where the absolute values of the autocorrelations decay exponentially quickly to zero. This is in contrast to the typical power-law decay for the 0.5 < H < 1 and 0 < H < 0.5 cases.  
  
Hurst exponent estimation is a viable tool for analyzing the past. Looking at a correctly estimated H value can answer the following question: was the market persistent, or was it anti-persistent? In turn, that would help you analyze the performance of your trading strategy or expert advisor during that particular period.

After the process is complete, your MT4 chart will be filled with an additional number of bars ranging between 2048 and 65536 M1 bars. These bars are directly sourced from your broker's server (not Metaquotes). This imported data usually exceeds the amount that can be retrieved normally, providing the v2v dynamic trading system with a more extensive historical tick dataset for analysis.

  1. Afterward, delete any dummy tick data from 1970 to maintain accuracy. If you haven't obtained the maximum historical data post-deletion, re-add the 1970 record temporarily and repeat the process.
  2. This approach efficiently acquires maximum M1 data for your selected currency pair. Proceed to download data for other timeframes as needed.

**Important Notes:**

  1. The v2v dynamic trading system uses M1 historical tick data by default. Load other TF data using the same steps.
  2. The system needs a broad tick data history, so it should grow with the MT4 platform.
  3. As the platform gathers data, error messages ("not enough tick data to calculate," "data horizon breach," and "array out of range") should no longer appear in the Expert logs.

  
The v2v dynamic trading system is a powerful tool, but its effectiveness depends on the user's skill.

Yes, probably in the future release (including line thickness of those FX Fixing levels), but not a priority at the moment as I am still working on something.  
  
Thanks for the feedback.

I do use MIDASes (i.e. VWAPs, they both are the same in formulas ;-) ancored at some specific and common-used timeframes, from the beginning of the year and month, for example. Try it, and you will be pleasantly surprised. I do use them for many years so far.  
  
Additionally I must say that the ancored MIDAS/VWAPs are the realy true support and resistance tools. No tools are needed.  
But to see the whole market picture one needs using the MIDAS/VWAPs legacy for the different timeframes.

P.S.  
  
At last, v2v, take some sort of thoughts about possibility to use your VWAP indicator twice or triple times at the same chart. It can be interesting to have, but it is hard work for a computer though.

Yes, heavy indeed... it eats a lot of CPU resources. About the weekly high & lows... it was actually coded with no lines...  
  
I am about to upload the new release wherein VP-R is now fused with VWAP (as a 1st instance of this system) ... Hence, the v2v VWAP is for anchoring Only (as a 2nd instance of this system). And if the user wanted to attach another, it simply needs to change the Instance ID (as a 3rd instance of this system). ─though users can use another VWAP (lightweight version).

V2v,  
  
1/ As for the first bolded - Yes, I thought of that way. Got it!  
2/ The second bolded, on the picture you have shown the cross of two VWAPs, yes, you have nailed it again - it might be used this way.

> {quote} Yes, heavy indeed... it eats a lot of CPU resources. About the weekly high & lows... it was actually coded with no lines... I am about to upload the new release wherein VP-R is now fused with VWAP (as a 1st instance of this system) ... Hence, the v2v VWAP is for anchoring Only (as a 2nd instance of this system). And if the user wanted to attach another, it simply needs to change the Instance ID (as a 3rd instance of this system). ─though users can use another VWAP (lightweight version). {image}

**Tip of the day...**  
  
─ You can delete the vertical line guides to reset its position. In result... all vertical line guides reverts to Bar 1, except data horizon line (if enabled) ─a guide for indicators with PVP line).  
  
─ Another way... press >>> _**Ctrl + B**_ on your keyboard >>>**Select All** >>> **DELETE ─** _all v2v system objects will be restored_  
  
  
This may be useful if ever you are switching from higher TF down to lower TF

Hi, v2v  
  
I just would like to ask is there any possibility to add SD bands as an option?  
I understand motivation you have said before, however, I would like to look at origins where both of SD and ATR bands cross.  
It is not a priority, but may be useful.

I was looking at it... but I hold it off for a while as I am still cleaning up or streamlining the existing codes or structure of the system, making sure there will be no big issues.

Classic method !  
  
In other words, PVP becomes support / resistance, respectively.  
  
**Addon to the above thesis - if PVP is broken through, the price goes to VWAP.**

I don't know what you mean... but it will remain as it is... until I decided that it is useless, but so far those shifted VWAP is as good as it gets as a MIDAS (not much though) type of tool. The core of the v2v dynamic system is Volume Profile & Range (ATR, ADR, AWR, AMR and Custom Range)... and the VWAP tool/strategy is just one the confirmation bias (TDZ, Pivot Fibs) that may support the core or the main context.  
  
If you want to turn it off.. simply change the indicator parameter to disable shifted VWAP.  
  
Note: My coding skills (intermediate) are not that advance compares to the likes of a gun programmer or speed coder with the likes of abokwaik or the master coder like mladen... and the likes. This is just one of the reasons why I stated at post #1 the following statement:

  1. Ideas/suggestions are very much welcome _, but don't expect that it can be_ _added or considered._

**Latest NFCI Release**  
  
Index Points to Steady Financial Conditions in**Week Ending April 5**  
  
The **NFCI was unchanged** at –0.84 in the week ending April 5. Risk indicators contributed –0.37, credit indicators contributed –0.32, and leverage indicators contributed –0.15 to the index in the latest week.  
  
TThe **ANFCI was also unchanged** in the latest week, at –0.67. Risk indicators contributed –0.47, credit indicators contributed –0.37, leverage indicators contributed –0.12, and the adjustments for prevailing macroeconomic conditions contributed 0.29 to the index in the latest week.  
  
The NFCI and ANFCI are each constructed to have an average value of zero and a standard deviation of one over a sample period extending back to 1971. Positive values of the NFCI have been historically associated with tighter-than-average financial conditions, while negative values have been historically associated with looser-than-average financial conditions. Similarly, positive values of the ANFCI have been historically associated with financial conditions that are tighter than what would be typically suggested by prevailing macroeconomic conditions, while negative values have been historically associated with the opposite.

v2v dynamic system _has been updated:_

  1. font size adjustment of navigational buttons
  2. improved allow dll checks with info /error display on the chart
  3. when clearing all objects manually >>> pressing [ CTRL + B ] [ List All ] [ CTRL + A ] [ Delete ] will restore all objects. A sort of maintenance only if you added a bunch of lines or you wanted a reset of all objects location (e.g. VWAP/VPR vertical line guides ─ to & from <<< though you may delete just the two normally in a simple stroke of mouse and delete key)
  4. added another sync action for vpr indi (visual issue) and pivot fibs plus indicator with regards to one particular screen setup for horizontal bar type (#4) to clear the show box session (static broker session).

**Updated info... ( post #1 )**  
  
The core indicator of this system are the following ( in no particular order ) :

  1. Pivot Fibs plus
  2. Volumes on Main Chart
  3. Volume Profile - Range ( VP-R )
  4. VWAP

  
**☄** _Ideally..._  
  
☛ The v2v dynamic system is best suited on H4 TF or higher using a Trend following strategy... However, **if Session timings are the main or crucial part of a strategy, one must/should or may consider using the H1 timeframe and below ONLY** _**.**_ This is particularly logical or correct as the indicator builds pivots using the current chart prices (data). So there is no sense to use the Session guides ( Weekly-Monthly-Q1-Yearly ) for time frames higher than H1. It means... that one needs to be careful when using a Weekly chart to build MN1, Q1, and YR1 because as the original coder of the All Pivots indicator (the core of Pivot Fibs plus) said that... he can't get the exact start date of these timeframes, which is actually true. Hence don't rely on Pivots build if your current chart timeframe is higher than H1. Thus on the W1 chart, one should look "inside" of bars to find the correct prices for 1st January and 31st December of each year (almost always). Hence, the original coder suggested not use the Pivots on larger than D1 timeframes.   
  
☛ With Volume Profile ─ Range indicator which is typically suited for the M30 timeframe is very useful together with Pivot Fibs plus indicator which has the PVP (Peak Volume Price, also known as POC) without the horizontal volume bars.  
  
☛ Swing Traders may use the TDZ's dynamic floating levels or zones (band high & low with midpoint) that may look to show OB/S levels (careful, looks ONLY).  
  
☛ **The Pivot Fibs indicator is armed with calculated ranges wherein the Daily and Weekly range info is better or more reliable if the current timeframe is less than or equal H1 TF only... more importantly when gauging or sizing up the trading range.**

that's good, I always act away from the big volume, 70% fits that too, you know the market does what he wants it's always 50-50, you have great weather on your picture

Yes, indeed... one of Dalton's product of his teachings. I wasn't able to say that earlier because of his surname as I might misspell it ; )─. I downloaded his videos from youtube last year. There's [another guy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxWgRXdEDicIIzq-Q1VlTZA)... from India.

...probably they are on vacation ; )─ ...in normal days, I am waiting for that movement most of the time in confluence with volume accumulation inflection points based on volume profile... but as long as I have a better understanding of the fundamental bias behind it or analysis(quantitative/qualitative)... If incomplete, I'll rely on volume/market profile context.

Yes, I know it is Easter.  
  
Anyway... How do you find the trading style of Trader Dale using Volume Profile? <<< besides the fact he's selling his services for a fee, and a custom indicator he sells. ─not promoting, as I even modified/fused my own Volume Profile... and even VWAP.. and fused PIVOT FIBS with its own built-in POC or PVP.  
  
Anyway, just wondering if you ever checked it out before. Though I found it the simplest form of Market/Volume Profile without the 70% value area (high/low), 80-20 inside value view, initial balance, of course, the context behind those letters, TPO counts, etc...

Oh! even me... it is very interesting for me too when I started to fused Volume Profile context with ATR based VWAP to find the starting point in relation with trading range ─which is something new or fresh as I never have seen anyone did that... as far as I know (in retail traders domain).

...UJ view with TDZ Angleator: ...looking green ; )─ but still just lurking near or around Weekly Pivot  
  
Not sharing the latest (early last year) TDZ Angleator as this is too intensive or too heavy for MT4. This indicator is born out of TMS Angleator by GS using the classic TDI setup.

  2. the pending alert time (in minutes) is converted accordingly to hours and days or minutes remaining
  3. code optimization

_

  1. reduced indicator filesize
  2. code optimization
  3. minor issue fixed on the update process
  4. change default colors with other indicators
  5. brought back divergence with TDZ-MTF only
  6. fixed slope change color for TDZ-MTF mode
  7. fixed _array out of range_ issue with TDZ indicators
  8. fixed Weekly Range on-load display ─ _PIVOT FIBS plus indicator_

Note: By default, some of these indicators are using a limited number of bars to load on-chart in order to add multiple functions & features ─more than the usual. However, having such a self-imposed limitation... produces some unexpected (due to limited coding skills) ; )─ and expected issues that I was able/tried to rectify along the way.

Hi, v2vboni  
  
I have just tried to use the VWAP at the Brent H1 chart. Look at it below.  
Why does this ATR Monthly not fit the price volatility? Try youself.

It may be due to market timing ─open session for this type of CFDs or some other reason(s) e.g. bad coding, data, etc.. However, I didn't check much but probably that's the way it is... this indicator ideally for FX pairs only. But, you may use the shifted VWAP multiplier option with the value of 3, 6 or 9 (default 1.0) and the number of pips that you think is correct for a Monthly ATR (if you have this, no need to use a multiplier, keep it as 1.0) ─That is the purpose of these parameters.  
  
You may check the chart below as an example.

Anyway, tired of coding lately as I am busy with streamlining my trading strategy/setup/structure.  
  
Note: I recompiled some of the indicators as sometimes with MT4 bug... It may need to compile three times before the update shows on the chart.

In case of issues due to previous versions... as the **v2v dynamic system** (including **News Event indicator**) uses global variables extensively. Below are the maintenance steps that you may follow:   
  
MT4 global variable maintenance:

  1. Press "F3" on your keyboard to delete all or selectively the global variable(s)
  2. Or you may use the included Volume on Chart indicator

MT4 object maintenance:

  1. Press "Ctrl" + "B" on your keyboard
  2. Delete all (...and "Ctrl"+"A") or selectively (...put click on checkbox) the objects ─ more importantly, to reset the vertical line guides chart positions that are used for setting up VWAP and Volume Profile chart range.

I just use the system to identify the probable price inflection points after generating my own bias via the following:

  1. fundamental sides (inter-market relationships), and technical sentiment (based on data - e.g. CFTC, options expiries.. etc.)
  2. market sentiment/behavior
  3. economic data analysis (labor, inflationary, GDP, surveys, central bank data/statement and spoken)
  4. upcoming major news, desk news headlines or chatters ...etc.

Then... Once I have my own bias, I open my charts to see if I could find some technical confluence, and trade my bias (fundamentals) technically by identifying:

  1. The current trend using the simplest form of Price Action (candle math with price action - pin bar, support becomes resistance; vice-versa)
  2. Using Volume Profile to identify...

    1. Virgin(s) or Not Virgin(s): Point of Control (POC) or Peak Volume Price (PVP)
    2. Locate the Price areas wherein there's a highest or lowest Volume (tick) being traded:

      1. Low Volume Nodes (LVN)
      2. High Volume Nodes (HVN)

    3. The location of the VWAP in relation to the Volume POC or the LVN and HVN

  3. Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP): Does Price respect VWAP in relation to Volume Profile's POC?
  4. Verify if ATR or ADR values are respected in confluence to POC, VWAP, PA, and S&R 
  5. Then, the position sizing comes into play in relation to where exactly I plan to enter into a trade, and where to set-up my stop and take profit level(s).

Thus, the v2v dynamic trading system is not a stand-alone system... it needs you... as a trader... or as an individual with unique sets of the following:

  1. trading knowledge
  2. skills with resourcefulness driven passion.
  3. behavior (or mental conditions), 
  4. and experience.

Now, with my less than five years of trading experience... I never found any system so consistent so far. ; )─ ...including this system of mine.  
  
Hence, using my system will return different results (varies) for each individual trader...

Since Frank Sinatra sings in his own way, my chart sing... I did it, my way

“If you have some technical system you love. That’s fine. Keep using it. Just add news following to whatever process you currently have.  
Observe or search why each currency is moving. Find out what the experts expect the market to do next. Just tune in and absorb. Do this daily.” ─jarratt  
  
The 2-Step formula for finding higher probability trades:

  1. Always have a good Fundamental reason or driver to either sell or buy any currency
  2. Find a catalyst or trigger – like news events – that support that Fundamental bias

**※ Neural Network ****─ HMA-DSMA** _**...v 1.09**_  
  
☛ Using a variation of HMA algorithm of low-lag to zero-lag, and then... fused with the following:  
↓  
☛ Jurik Filters/Smoothing and custom MA types  
☛ Combined with Deviation-Scaled Moving Average Algorithm  
☛ Better & Best Formula (Better & APB calculation)  
↓  
✦ The button text shows the average predicted open price  
✦ As always this type of indicator eats a lot of CPU resources...  
  
**Brief theory of Neural Networks:**  
  
_The Neural network_ is an adjustable model of outputs as functions of inputs. It consists of several _layers_ :

  1. _input layer_ , which consists of input data
  2. _hidden layer_ , which consists of processing nodes called _neurons_
  3. _output layer_ , which consists of one or several neurons, whose outputs are the network outputs.

All nodes of adjacent layers are interconnected. These connections are called _synapses_. Every synapse has an assigned scaling coefficient, by which the data propagated through the synapse is multiplied. These scaling coefficient are called weights (w[i][j][k]). In a _Feed-Forward Neural Network_ (FFNN) the data is propagated from inputs to the outputs. Here is an example of FFNN with one input layer, one output layer, and two hidden layers:  

Attached Image

![](/attachment/image/3402338?d=1564684588)

  
The topology of a FFNN is often abbreviated as follows: <# of inputs> \- <# of neurons in the first hidden layer> \- <# of neurons in the second hidden layer> -...- <# of outputs>. The above network can be referred to as a 4-3-3-1 network.  
The data is processed by neurons in two steps, correspondingly shown within the circle by a summation sign and a step sign:

  1. All inputs are multiplied by the associated weights and summed
  2. The resulting sums are processed by the neuron's _activation function_ , whose output is the neuron output.

It is the neuron's activation function that gives non-linearity to the neural network model. Without it, there is no reason to have hidden layers, and the neural network becomes a linear auto-regressive (AR) model.

Don't simply use a Moving Average on your chart... Let's make it a little bit complicated ; )─  
For that, here is the **※****Long****& ****Short****Deviation Scaled Moving Averages... (DSMA)** **※** ; )─ Enjoy and have a nice weekend!  
  
DSMA was described in the “The Deviation-Scaled Moving Average.” article of July 2018 TASC Magazine There John Ehlers describes not only the Deviation scaled moving average but a cross of two DSMAs. ─ But with this indicator, it is a system multiple DSMA crossovers.  
  
Similar to GUPPY indicator in terms of Moving Average values and how it is being used ─But with the following fused algorithms...  
  
☛ JMA (Jurik Moving Average): Smoothing/Filter  

─ Long DSMA acts like the Slow JMA, and

─ Short DSMA acts like the Fast JMA

☛ Hull Moving Average non-lag variation  
  
✔ The DSMA is a data smoothing technique that acts as an exponential moving average with a dynamic smoothing coefficient. The smoothing coefficient is automatically updated based on the magnitude of price changes. In the Deviation-Scaled Moving Average, the standard deviation from the mean is chosen to be the measure of this magnitude. The resulting indicator provides substantial smoothing of the data even when price changes are small while quickly adapting to these changes.  
  
✔ Jurik Filters, Phase, and Smoothing  
This indicator utilized JMA's (Jurik Research Moving Average) phase and smoothing calculation. Have you noticed how moving averages add some lag (delay) to your signals? ... especially when price gaps up or down in a big move, and you are waiting for your moving average to catch up? Wait no more! JMA eliminates these complications forever and gives you the best of both worlds: low lag and smooth lines.  
  
Ideally, for instance, a filtered signal may both be smooth and lag-free. Lag causes delays in your trades, and increasing lag in your indicators typically results in lower profits. In other words, latecomers get what's left on the table after the feast has already begun. The JMA's improved timing and smoothness will astound you.  
  
JMA is a powerful adaptive tracker that can smooth time series data with a very small lag, no overshoots and no oscillations. The algorithm is stable and avoids the complexities of neural networks. JMA delivers the best all-around performance for smoothness, accuracy, and timeliness.  
  
✔ Hull Moving Average  
There are many types of moving averages, the most basic being the Simple Moving Average (SMA). Of all the moving averages the SMA lags price the most. The Exponential and Weighted Moving Averages were developed to address this lag by placing more emphasis on more recent data. The Hull Moving Average (HMA), developed by Allan Hull, is an extremely fast and smooth moving average. In fact, the HMA almost eliminates lag altogether and manages to improve smoothing at the same time.

...**v2v dynamic trading system** is powered by **JMA**  
  
And here's what the Jurik Research Team said about their algorithms:  
  
What is the Theory Behind JMA ?  
  
PART 1 : PRICE GAPS  
Smoothing time series data, such as daily stock prices, in order to remove unwanted noise will inevitably produce a graph (indicator) that moves slower than the original time series. This "slowness" will cause the plot to lag somewhat behind the original series. For example, a 31 day simple moving average will lag the price time series by 15 days.  
Lag is very undesirable because a trading system using that information will have its trading delayed. Late trades can many times be worse than no trades at all, as you might buy or sell on the wrong side of the market's cycle. Consequently, many attempts were made to minimize lag, each with their own failings.  
Conquering lag while making no simplifying assumptions (e.g., that data consists of superimposed cycles, daily price changes having a Gaussian distribution, all prices are equally important, etc.) is not a trivial task. In the end, JMA had to based on the same technology the military uses to track moving objects in the air using nothing more than their noisy radar. JMA sees the price time series as a noisy image of a moving target (the underlying smooth price) and tries to estimate the location of the real target (smooth price). The proprietary mathematics is modified to take into consideration the special properties of a financial time series.  
The result is a silky smooth curve that makes no assumptions about the data having any cyclic components whatsoever. Consequently JMA can turn "on a dime" if the market (moving target) decides to turn direction or gap up/down by any amount. No price gap is too large.  
  
PART 2 : EVERYTHING ELSE  
After several years of research, we Jurik Research determined that the perfect noise reduction filter for financial data has the following requirements:

  1. Minimum lag between signal and price, otherwise trade triggers come late.
  2. Minimum overshoot, otherwise signal produces false price levels.
  3. Minimum undershoot, otherwise time is lost waiting for convergence after price gaps.
  4. Maximum smoothness, except at the moment when price gaps to a new level.

When measured up to these four requirements, all popular filters (except JMA) perform poorly. Here is a summary of the more popular filters...

  1. Weighted Moving Average -- not responsive to gaps
  2. Exponential Moving Average -- excessive undershoot; noisy
  3. Adaptive Moving Averages -- (not ours) typically based on oversimplified assumptions about market activity; easily fooled
  4. Regression Line -- not responsive to gaps; excessive overshoot
  5. FFT filters -- easily distorted by non-Gaussian noise in data; window is typically too small to accurately determine true cycles.
  6. FIR filters -- has lag known as "group delay". No way around it unless you want to cut some corners. See "Band-Pass" filters.
  7. Band-Pass filters -- no lag only at center of frequency band; tends to oscillate and overshoot actual prices.
  8. Maximum Entropy filters -- easily distorted by non-Gaussian noise in data; window is typically too small to accurately determine true cycles.
  9. Polynomial Filters -- not responsive to gaps; excessive overshoot

In contrast, JMA integrates information theory and adaptive non-linear filtering in a unique way. By combining an assessment of the information content in a time series with the power of adaptive nonlinear transformation, the result pushes the theoretical "envelope" on financial time series filtering almost as far as it can go. Any more and we'd be up against Heisenburg's Uncertainty Principle (something no one has overcome, or ever will).

No... not from zero, from here >>> <https://www.mql5.com/en/code/9002>  
  
I simply recorded accordingly to my preferred (or based on my limited coding skills with constraints) coding structure that I consistently been using.  
  
Then fused with some algorithms

  1. DSMA
  2. HMA
  3. Jurik
  4. and with some optional custom MAs

The charts summarize the relative position of an exchange rate relative to its performance over the last year. The yellow background indicates the square dimension of the chart. The orange dot indicates today's position relative to the high (top of the chart) and low (bottom of the chart) of the FX index during the last 365 days. So if the orange dot is close to the top, the currency is close to its highest valuation. If the orange dot is close to the bottom, the currency is near its lowest valuation. The blue bars indicate the distribution of valuations over the course of one year. The span between high and low valuation is divided into ten ranges (ie, deciles). Then the number of days during which the currency's valuation has been in each of these deciles is counted. The number of days is proportional to the width of each of the ten blue bars. Thus the position of the orange dot relative to the width of the blue bars indicates if the current valuation is a relatively common event or a relatively rare event. For example, if the bulk of valuations has been in the lower deciles, and the orange dot is near the top where the bars are narrow, the currency has recently moved up sharply. These charts ("FX conifers") are a simple method of visually summarizing the performance of a currency over the time period of one year. One useful feature of this chart is that it automatically adjusts for the different volatility of currencies, as the span between one-year high and one-year low is a reflection of a currency's volatility.

A trade-weighted currency index is a weighted average of a basket of currencies that reflects the importance of a country's trade (imports and exports) with these countries. Sometimes a trade-weighted currency index is taken as a crude measure of a country's international "competitiveness". At any rate, a trade-weighted currency index is a useful measure to aggregate diverging trends among currencies of a country's trading partners. For example, Canada is trading mostly with the United States. Thus the USD/CAD exchange rate has a weight of about 80% in Canada's trade-weighted CAD index.

**...More about****JMA**  
  
  
**Why does JMA have a PHASE parameter?**  
  
There are two ways to decrease noise in a time series using JMA. Increasing the LENGTH parameter will make JMA move slower and thereby reduce noise at the expense of added lag.  
  
Alternatively, you can change the amount of "inertia" contained within JMA. Inertia is like physical mass, the more you have, the more difficult it is to turn direction. So a filter with lots of inertia will require more time to reverse direction and thereby reduce noise at the expense of overshooting during reversals in the time series.  
All strong noise filters have lag and overshoot, and JMA is no exception. However, the JMA's adjustable parameters PHASE and LENGTH offer you a way to select the optimal tradeoff between lag and overshoot. This gives you the opportunity to fine-tune various technical indicators.

![](/attachment/image/3405308?d=1565072666)

  
For example, the chart (above shows a fast JMA line crossing over a slower JMA line. To make the fast JMA line turn "on a dime" whenever the market reverses, it was set to have no inertia. In contrast, the slow JMA was set to have large inertia, thereby slowing down its ability to turn during market reversals. This arrangement causes the faster line to cross over the slower line as quickly as possible, thereby producing low lag crossover signals. Clearly, user control of a filter's inertia offers considerable power over filters lacking this capability.  
  
  
**Does JMA forecast a time-series?**  
  
It does not forecast into the future. JMA reduces noise pretty much the same way as an exponential moving average, but many times better.   
  
  
**Will prior JMA values, already plotted, change as new data arrives?**  
  
No. For any point on a JMA plot, only historical and current data is used in the formula. Consequently, as new price data arrive on later time slots, those values of JMA already plotted are not affected and NEVER change.   
  
Also, consider the case when the most recent bar on a chart is updated in real-time as each new tick arrives. Since the closing price of the most recent bar is likely to change, JMA is automatically re-evaluated to reflect the new closing price. However, historical values of JMA (on all prior bars) remain unaffected and do not change.  
One can create impressive-looking indicators on historical data when it analyzes both past and future values surrounding each data point being processed. However, any formula that needs to see future values in a time series cannot be applied in real-world trading. This is because when calculating today's value of an indicator, future values don't exist. All Jurik based indicators use only current and previous time-series data in its calculations. This allows all Jurik indicators to work in all real-time conditions.  
  
  
**How does JMA compare to other filters?**  
  
The Kalman filter is similar to JMA in that both are powerful algorithms used for estimating the behavior of a noisy dynamical system when all you have to work with is noisy data measurements. The Kalman filter creates smooth forecasts of the time series, and this method is not entirely appropriate for financial time series as the markets are prone to produce violent gyrations and price gaps, behaviors not typical of smoothly operating dynamical systems. Consequently, Kalman filter smoothing frequently lags behind or overshoots market price time series. In contrast, JMA tracks market prices closely and smoothly, adapting to gaps while avoiding unwanted overshoots. See chart below for an example.

Two other popular indicators are T3 and TEMA. They are smooth and have little lag. T3 is the better of the two. Nonetheless, T3 can exhibit a serious overshoot problem, as seen in the chart below. Depending on your application, you may not want an indicator showing a price level the real market never attained, as this may inadvertently initiate unwanted trades.

Better Moving Averages Tim Tillson November 1, 1998  
  
Tim Tillson is a software project manager at Hewlett-Packard, with degrees in Mathematics and Computer Science. He has privately traded options and equities for 15 years.  
  
**Introduction**  
  
"Digital filtering includes the process of smoothing, predicting, differentiating, integrating, separation of signals, and removal of noise from a signal. Thus many people who do such things are actually using digital filters without realizing that they are; being unacquainted with the theory, they neither understand what they have done nor the possibilities of what they might have done."  
  
This quote from R. W. Hamming applies to the vast majority of indicators in technical analysis. Moving averages, be they simple, weighted, or exponential, are lowpass filters; low-frequency components in the signal pass through with little attenuation, while high frequencies are severely reduced. "Oscillator" type indicators (such as MACD, Momentum, Relative Strength Index) are another type of digital filter called a differentiator. Tushar Chande has observed that many popular oscillators are highly correlated, which is sensible because they are trying to measure the rate of change of the underlying time series, i.e., are trying to be the first and second derivatives we all learned about in Calculus.  
We use moving averages (lowpass filters) in technical analysis to remove the random noise from a time series, to discern the underlying trend or to determine prices at which we will take action. A perfect moving average would have two attributes:  
  
It would be smooth, not sensitive to random noise in the underlying time series. Another way of saying this is that its derivative would not spuriously alternate between positive and negative values.  
  
It would not lag behind the time series it is computed from. Lag, of course, produces late buy or sell signals that kill profits.  
  
The only way one can compute a perfect moving average is to have knowledge of the future, and if we had that, we would buy one lottery ticket a week rather than trade!  
  
(See Appendix II below for more elaboration). Having said this, we can still improve on the conventional simple, weighted, or exponential moving averages. Here's how:  
  
**Two Interesting Moving Averages**  
  
We will examine two benchmark moving averages based on Linear Regression analysis.  
  
In both cases, a Linear Regression line of length n is fitted to price data.  
  
I call the first moving average ILRS, which stands for Integral of Linear Regression Slope. One simply integrates the slope of a linear regression line as it is successively fitted in a moving window of length n across the data, with the constant of integration being a simple moving average of the first n points. Put another way, the derivative of ILRS is the linear regression slope. Note that ILRS is not the same as a SMA (simple moving average) of length n, which is actually the midpoint of the linear regression line as it moves across the data.  
  
We can measure the lag of moving averages with respect to a linear trend by computing how they behave when the input is a line with unit slope. Both SMA(n) and ILRS(n) have lag of n/2, but ILRS is much smoother than SMA.  
  
Our second benchmark moving average is well known, called EPMA or End Point Moving Average. It is the endpoint of the linear regression line of length n as it is fitted across the data. EPMA hugs the data more closely than a simple or exponential moving average of the same length. The price we pay for this is that it is much noisier (less smooth) than ILRS, and it also has the annoying property that it overshoots the data when linear trends are present.  
  
However, EPMA has a lag of 0 with respect to linear input! This makes sense because a linear regression line will fit linear input perfectly, and the endpoint of the LR line will be on the input line.  
  
These two moving averages frame the tradeoffs that we are facing. On one extreme we have ILRS, which is very smooth and has considerable phase lag. EPMA has 0 phase lag, but is too noisy and overshoots. We would like to construct a better moving average which is as smooth as ILRS, but runs closer to where EPMA lies, without the overshoot.  
  
A easy way to attempt this is to split the difference, i.e. use (ILRS(n)+EPMA(n))/2. This will give us a moving average (call it IE/2) which runs in between the two, has phase lag of n/4 but still inherits considerable noise from EPMA. IE/2 is inspirational, however. Can we build something that is comparable, but smoother? Figure 1 shows ILRS, EPMA, and IE/2.  
  
**Filter Techniques**  
  
Any thoughtful student of filter theory (or resolute experimenter) will have noticed that you can improve the smoothness of a filter by running it through itself multiple times, at the cost of increasing phase lag.  
  
There is a complementary technique (called twicing by J.W. Tukey) which can be used to improve phase lag. If L stands for the operation of running data through a low pass filter, then twicing can be described by:  
  
L' = L(time series) + L(time series - L(time series))  
  
That is, we add a moving average of the difference between the input and the moving average to the moving average. This is algebraically equivalent to:  
  
2L-L(L)  
  
This is the Double Exponential Moving Average or DEMA, popularized by Patrick Mulloy in TASAC (January/February 1994). In our taxonomy, DEMA has some phase lag (although it exponentially approaches 0) and is somewhat noisy, comparable to IE/2.  
We will use these two techniques to construct our better moving average, after we explore the first one a little more closely.  
  
**Fixing Overshoot**  
  
An n-day EMA has smoothing constant alpha=2/(n+1) and a lag of (n-1)/2.  
  
Thus EMA(3) has lag 1, and EMA(11) has lag 5. Figure 2 shows that, if I am willing to incur 5 days of lag, I get a smoother moving average if I run EMA(3) through itself 5 times than if I just take EMA(11) once.  
  
This suggests that if EPMA and DEMA have 0 or low lag, why not run fast versions (eg DEMA(3)) through themselves many times to achieve a smooth result? The problem is that multiple runs though these filters increase their tendency to overshoot the data, giving an unusable result. This is because the amplitude response of DEMA and EPMA is greater than 1 at certain frequencies, giving a gain of much greater than 1 at these frequencies when running though themselves multiple times. Figure 3 shows DEMA(7) and EPMA(7) run through themselves 3 times. DEMA^3 has serious overshoot, and EPMA^3 is terrible.  
  
The solution to the overshoot problem is to recall what we are doing with twicing:  
  
DEMA(n) = EMA(n) + EMA(time series - EMA(n))  
  
The second term is adding, in effect, a smooth version of the derivative to the EMA to achieve DEMA. The derivative term determines how hot the moving average's response to linear trends will be. We need to simply turn down the volume to achieve our basic building block:  
  
EMA(n) + EMA(time series - EMA(n))*.7;  
  
This is algebraically the same as:  
  
EMA(n)*1.7-EMA(EMA(n))*.7;  
  
I have chosen .7 as my volume factor, but the general formula (which I call "Generalized Dema") is:  
  
GD(n,v) = EMA(n)*(1+v)-EMA(EMA(n))*v,  
  
where v ranges between 0 and 1. When v=0, GD is just an EMA, and when v=1, GD is DEMA. In between, GD is a cooler DEMA. By using a value for v less than 1 (I like .7), we cure the multiple DEMA overshoot problem, at the cost of accepting some additional phase delay. Now we can run GD through itself multiple times to define a new, smoother moving average T3 that does not overshoot the data:  
  
T3(n) = GD(GD(GD(n)))  
  
In filter theory parlance, T3 is a six-pole non-linear Kalman filter. Kalman filters are ones which use the error (in this case (time series - EMA(n)) to correct themselves. In Technical Analysis, these are called Adaptive Moving Averages; they track the time series more aggressively when it is making large moves.  
  
**Trading Results**  
  
I used Metastock 6.5 to compare 5 moving averages (SMA, ILRS, EMA, DEMA, and T3) on the Nasdaq index (NDX) from 7/19/93 to 6/30/97, almost four years of data. I set the interest rate at 4% annualized, and a trading cost of .1% for entry and exit. This is realistic, since I can trade up to 1000 shares through Fidelity Web Express for $14.95, and a typical trade might be 300 shares of a $50 stock.  
The system used was very simple. A moving average was computed using each of the five above. A derivative was taken (1-period Rate of Change function, ROC). A long position was entered at bottoms, and closed at tops, of the derivative. No shorts were taken. For example, the code for "enter long" for an EMA was:  
Code:  
res:=Mov(C,opt1,E); d1:=ROC(res,1,points); d1 > Ref(d1,-1) AND Ref(d1,-1) < Ref(d1,-2)  
I let opt1 vary from 2 to 10. This is a fast system, which executes a lot of trades. The table below summarizes the best results each MA was able to achieve; note that the optimal parameters did not vary widely.  
  
MA Optimal Parameter Best APR ILRS 7 19.02 SMA 8 20.20 EMA 8 28.17 DEMA 7 28.81 T3 5 (volume = .7) 33.59 No single set of backtesting results is conclusive, of course. But these numbers confirm that T3 has merit - it not only looks good to the eye on the chart, but can be a powerful building block in other indicators and trading systems.  
  
Appendix I - Metastock Implementations  
  
Metastock 6.5 code for ILRS:  
Code:  
{input number of lookback periods, default is 11} periods:=Input("Periods? ",2,63,11); {determine how many points are in the time series} size:=LastValue(Cum(1)); {determine the constant of integration by taking the simple moving average of the first periods points in the time series} start:=LastValue(Ref(Mov(P,periods,S),periods-size)); {value is the integral of linear regression slope plus the constant of integration} Cum(LinRegSlope(P,periods))+start;  
**Metastock 6.5 code for T3:**  
  
If x stands for the action of running a time series through an EMA, f is our formula for Generalized Dema with 'volume' a:  
Running the filter though itself three times is equivalent to cubing f:  
  
**Thus the Metastock 6.5 code for T3 is:**  
Code:  
periods:=Input("Periods? ",1,63,5); a:=Input("Hot? ",0,2,.7); e1:=Mov(P,periods,E); e2:=Mov(e1,periods,E); e3:=Mov(e2,periods,E); e4:=Mov(e3,periods,E); e5:=Mov(e4,periods,E); e6:=Mov(e5,periods,E); c1:=-a*a*a; c2:=3*a*a+3*a*a*a; c3:=-6*a*a-3*a-3*a*a*a; c4:=1+3*a+a*a*a+3*a*a; c1*e6+c2*e5+c3*e4+c4*e3;

**※ Heiken Ashi ─ Average Price Bars ( HA-APB )**_with PAC_  
  
The difference between the original HA-APB Price Action Channel ( PAC ) and this variation of PAC (using JMA, DSMA, and HMA), is that the latter is using three touchpoints instead of just the two-line PAC. This one added the Average Price to see if APB closed above or below it.  
  
☛ HA-APB based Price Action Channel ( PAC ) and  
☛ Average Price Line (HA-APB Low + HA-APB High)/2  
☛ Fused with MTF mode.  
☛ Using T3 MA and with...  
☛ Jurik Smoothing/Filter and Deviation-Scaled Moving Average (DSMA)  
...some extras added: Access buttons for features & functions, and a symbol or pair and timeframe switch panel  
↓  
✜ Price Action Channel (PAC)  
─ It provides an overall direction near the Price.  
─ Reveals periods of consolidation.  
─ Reveals periods of volatility.  
─ It may Use as an Exit Target or  
─ Use as a Trailing Stop Loss

**_v2v dynamic trading system_**** _updates..._**  
  
**※ Heiken Ashi ─ Average Price Bars ( HA-APB )**_with PAC_

  1. Key updates/more info:  
─ Removed consolidation wicks color change to focus only on bullish & bearish wicks color change... and more importantly on this APB bars below. Besides, one can easily identify a consolidation or contraction phase using this tool. Hence, one sort of redundancy out of the equation.  
This is not a buy or sell signal... it just another data/information in confluence to your own speculative/sentimental well-informed bias.

![](/attachment/image/3412262?d=1565716740)

  
─ HA Average Price line: Smoothed ( Both avg price line & PAC channels have combined filters used, such as DSMA, HMA non-lag variation, TEMA ),  
─ added MTF switch button, and  
─ HA bars automatic body width adjustment (zoom in/out) without waiting for a tick data

Earlier.... the volumes on main chart tool just reminded me how lucky I am that this tool is a part of my trading arsenal.  
  
The very first version was made by Mladen... And then, after I attached this to my chart, I just imagined how I could add the volatility code & alerts and making it the heart of a system.  
  
That's the time the v2v dynamic system was born.

the Neural Network (NN)... minor update

  1. Fixed the option for rerunning of Neural Network (wrongly run twice) on Button switch behavior... now, a one-time rerun execution only.
  2. Again... this option is "false" by default. If "true", upon button switch trigger... And at runtime, an observable high CPU usage can be seen.
  3. Reminder: Ideally, you may use this only as another confluence with your own speculative/sentimental well-informed bias.

※ Volume Profile - Range _with VWAP_  
※ anchored VWAP

  1. These tools are now using by default the tick Volume data source based on what the VP-Range tool (more on tick data quality) is currently using. Otherwise, it will use the default VWAP setup (classic VWAP)

The Mystical, Mathematical **MIDAS**  
An**_Anchored_ VWAP **Channel  
For Congested Markets  
_by Andrew Coles, PhD_  
  
  
Physicist _Paul Levine (R.I.P.)_ based his Midas (_market interpretation/data analysis system_) approach to technical analysis on a mathematical modification of the volume-weighted average price (vwap). Behind this modification is a well-thought-out philosophy of what drives market prices. This philosophy can be reduced to five basic tenets:

  1. The underlying order of price behavior is a fractal hierarchy of support and resistance levels.
  2. This interplay between support and resistance is coaction between accumulation and distribution.
  3. This coaction, when considered quantitatively from raw price and volume data, reveals a mathematical symmetry between support and resistance.
  4. This mathematical symmetry can be used to predict market tops and bottoms in advance.
  5. Price and volume data — the volume-weighted average price — subsequent to a reversal in trend, and thus to a major change in market (trader) sentiment, is key to this process of chart prediction.

  
_The problem:_  
While there is no obvious flaw in the logic that binds these five principles, there is one weakness in the final tenet involving what follows the end of a trend and a significant change in market sentiment. In his lectures, Levine repeatedly identified the ends of trends with significant trend reversals. Yet this need not be the case; the end of a trend will more likely herald a resting phase in market activity.  
  
  
**This one is an ATR based MIDAS Channel made by v2v**

I wanted to have MT5 version of v2v trading system to be finally made this year.  
  
However, it seems that ideas, bugs, modifications or updates /improvements to this v2v system just keep on going... and going... and going... ; )─

Hi!  
I see "TDZ_MTF GBPAUD,Daily: cannot set millisecond timer (200)" and

Behind this modification is a well-thought-out philosophy of what drives market prices. This philosophy can be reduced to five basic tenets: The underlying order of price behavior is a fractal hierarchy of support and resistance levels. This interplay...

The v2v trading system is not a noob-friendly trading environment or chart setup to trade with as it requires a superhuman trading experience ; )─. More so... as the tools/indicators are too technical for a trader with a K.I.S.S. mindset. Although, once you get the hang of using this system, it adheres to "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler." ; )─ Albert Einstein  
  
Anyway, here are the steps that may solve your issue in setting up this system: 

  1. Open the MT4 platform >>> press "Ctrl-O" ─it will pop-up an MT4 pop-up Window  
...and make sure you have the parameters or value as highlighted.  
...now close and open your MT4 platform again. 

Attached Image

![](/attachment/image/3457126?d=1570270216)

  2. Use the attached tools to load the history (tick data of each instrument/pair) - limited up to 2048 bytes of initial file size (history data file) ─a platform limitation...run the application and simply follow the on-screen instructions. If you are not able to do this successfully, I suggest that you find another trading system or tool to use. There are tons of it in this domain alone.  
...click to download this tool >>>**[Load history tool](https://www.forexfactory.com/attachment.php/2586790?attachmentid=2586790&d=1512342051) **  
  

  3. Now, open a blank chart with an instrument/pair  
...see the attached image and check why you need these steps. If you don't get it... just move on to another system.

  4. To fix the issue identified in Step #3... simply follow the sub-step below:  
─ open a blank chart (if you haven't yet)  
─ set your chart accordingly as highlighted below chart image:

  5. Press the "Home" key on your keyboard in order to show the current chart time frame data horizon. Such as, on M5 or M1 time frame - or any time frame that needed a much more tick data (volume) history to load on your chart.  
─ Now, press "Pu" (page up button) on your keyboard... continue pressing it repeatedly and it will manually load more historical data to your chart.  
─ You will need to do these for all the instruments/pairs or selectively the ones that you trade only  
─ For the template maintenance... Reset the FXV template by simply pressing "Ctrl-B" >>> "Ctrl-A" >>> "Delete" button, and save as your default template   
  
Note: The tools or indicators within the v2v trading system work in harmony with each other in terms of algorithm/parameters. Hence, if you attached it to your chart individually may not work fully or it may have issues.   
  

  6. If at this point you were still not able to make it work.. please read the attached image. Thank you

...a much better way to load history data (tick volume)  
Follow the steps below:

  1. Open an M1 chart
  2. Press "F2" key to load History Center
  3. Navigate to the currency pair and the "1 Minute (M1)" history data for the chart you have open in your terminal (be sure to "double click" the "1 Minute (M1)" selection in history center so it actually becomes the active selection)
  4. Then left-click once on any of the data rows in the right-hand window of the History Center (it doesn't matter which one)
  5. Click the "Add" button, this pops up another window titled "Bar" and the default selection is on the "year"
  6. Enter 1970
  7. Then select "OK"... and it creates a new bar with the timestamp and price info you just added.
  8. Now select "Close" in the History Center
  9. Navigate to your M1 chart of interest and then from the terminal menu select "Charts -> Refresh"...this will refresh the chart and attempts to fill any time gaps in the chart data (which now includes your year 1970 data point) with server data  
Step 9 continued...Now your chart will have pulled anywhere from 2048 to 65536 M1 bars from your broker's server (not Metaquotes server) and is usually far more data than you can get the broker to cough up when you try and manually scroll your M1 chart back in time

Now you have really quickly downloaded all the broker's M1 data on your currency pair that the broker is going to let you have, much faster than holding down the home or pg-up key for minutes and minutes to download even fewer data. It works with charts of other timeframes as well.

**Momenticks** _fused by v2v_  
  
**Linear momentum** is defined as the product of a system's mass multiplied by its velocity. In symbols, **linear momentum** is expressed as _p = mv_. **Momentum** is directly proportional to the object's mass and also its velocity. Thus the greater an object's mass or the greater its velocity, the greater its **momentum**.

**v2v Momenticks **─ A volume-weighted price linear momentum  
Linear momentum is defined as the product of a system's mass multiplied by its velocity. In symbols, linear momentum is expressed as p = mv. Momentum is directly proportional to the object's mass and also its velocity. Thus the greater an object's mass or the greater its velocity, the greater its momentum.   
  
  
p = momentum;  
m = mass is converted into volume of trade or tick data.  
v = velocity, it’s a value taken from pips movement divided by timeframe in point/seconds.  
  
Now... with anchored Momenticks.

Read about Linear Momentum:

> Impulse Affects Momentum  
>  Any moving object can have momentum. This is because momentum is mass in motion. The way we determine an object's momentum is fairly straightforward. Momentum is the object's mass times its velocity, or, in equation form, p=mv, where p is momentum, m is mass in kilograms, and v is velocity in meters per second. Momentum is proportional to both mass and velocity, meaning that a change in one will cause the same amount of change in the other. So if you increase an object's mass, you also increase its momentum. The same is true for velocity: increase or decrease the object's speed, and you increase or decrease its momentum by the same amount.  
>  But usually it's the object's velocity that changes instead of its mass, right? You may remember that a change in velocity means the object is accelerating. You may also remember that acceleration is caused by a force and that the greater the force, the greater the acceleration. Therefore, the greater the acceleration, the greater the momentum!  
>  Force is an important factor, but time also counts. Specifically, when we are interested in knowing how long the force acts. For example, if you push a box across the floor for just a few seconds, the time interval is very short. But if you push a box across the floor and you do so with the same force as before, but this time for several minutes, you've increased the amount of time the force acts. This longer time interval leads to a greater change in momentum. This change in momentum is called impulse, and it describes the quantity that we just saw: the force times the time interval it acts over. The greater the impulse, the greater the change in momentum. To change the impulse, you can either change the amount of force, or you can change the time interval in which that force acts. In equation form, we can write this relationship between impulse and momentum as

>  The Greek letter delta means 'change in,' and we read this equation as force times the time interval equals the change in mass times velocity. Be careful not to read this as 'force times time equals mass times velocity' because now you're saying that 'impulse equals momentum.' It's important to remember that impulse is a change in momentum, not the momentum itself.  
>    
>  Changing Time and Force  
>  If you want a large increase in momentum, you need to exert a large force over a long time period. When you quickly shove the box, it doesn't move very quickly across the floor, but if you push it with that same force for a long period of time, you can move it all the way across the room. This is because you've increased the time variable on the left side of the equation. When an object is brought to rest, its momentum also changes, but now it decreases instead of increases. Time is especially important in this situation because a longer time interval means less force acts on the object to result in the same change in momentum.  
>  Say for example that a stunt double jumped from a 10-story window during an action scene. Does she want to land on the sidewalk, which is very hard, or does she want to land on a soft cushion? She definitely wants to land on the soft cushion because this cushioning will increase the time of her impact and decrease the force on her as she lands. In either case, her impulse, or her change in momentum, is exactly the same because in either case, she goes from moving to a state of rest. The difference is that the change occurs over a different time period and with a different amount of force.

Just a reminder, this tool is about Linear **"Momentum"**. This is not the usual trading tool wherein you buy or sell whenever it crosses the zero line level. More so, if you selected the Rate of Change (ROC) or the Adaptive ATR option. Hence, you may use this tool if you need additional technical insights for your own generated based line analysis (FA & TA).

By the way... the adaptive ATR feature was based on mladen's work shared at metaquotes. Please read the below information he shared with it.  
  
"_Average True Range (ATR) is a widely used indicator in many occasions. It is calculated as SMA (Simple Moving Average) of true range (which is calculated as the greatest of the following: current high less the current low, the absolute value of the current high less the previous close and the absolute value of the current low less the previous close). With an added "twist": It is using Perry Kaufman's Efficiency Ratio to calculate adaptive true range"_  
  
And with this Momenticks release, the usage is... the same.   
  
  
I just updated the above Momenticks wherein it shows the previous and current ATR value

**

**  
Theory:**  
There is always a need to measure if the market is "quiet" or it is volatile. One of the possible ways is to use standard deviations, but the issue is simple: we do not have some levels that could help us find out if the market is in a state of lower or higher volatility. This feature is attempting to do that :

  1. values above level 0 are indicating a state of increasing volatility
  2. values below level 0 are indicating a state of decreasing volatility

  
**Usage :**  
This is not a directional feature. It should be used for volatility detection, not trend assessment - for that, you have to use some other indicator and then check this one if the market volatility conditions are those that you expect

Get the updated release >>> **[here](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=901713)**  
  
**=========================**  
  
**A must before loading the v2v dynamic trading system**  
  
Follow the steps below:

  1. Open an M1 chart
  2. Press "F2" key to load History Center
  3. Navigate to the currency pair and the "1 Minute (M1)" history data for the chart you have open in your terminal (be sure to "double click" the "1 Minute (M1)" selection in history center so it becomes the active selection)
  4. Then left-click once on any of the data rows in the right-hand window of the History Center (it doesn't matter which one)
  5. Click the "Add" button, this pops up another window titled "Bar" and the default selection is on the "year"
  6. Enter 1970
  7. Then select "OK"... and it creates a new bar with the timestamp and price info you just added.
  8. Now select "Close" in the History Center
  9. Navigate to your M1 chart of interest and then from the terminal menu select "Charts -> Refresh"...this will refresh the chart and attempts to fill any time gaps in the chart data (which now includes your year 1970 data point) with server data  
Step 9 continued...Now your chart will have pulled anywhere from 2048 to 65536 M1 bars from your broker's server (not Metaquotes server) and is usually far more data than you can get the broker to cough up when you try and manually scroll your M1 chart back in time

  
  
If everything went fine... then you've quickly downloaded all the broker's M1 data on your currency pair that the broker is going to let you have, much faster than holding down the home or page-up key for minutes and minutes to download even fewer data. Now, you may continue with the rest of the time frames. But, don't forget to delete (it depends on the MT4 server set up by your broker) the year 1970 dummy tick data after it downloads more history and/or check if after deletion it will revert back to a default max of 2048 history size otherwise add 1970 once again.

**=========================**  
  
**A must before loading the v2v dynamic trading system (_new steps_)**  
  
Follow the steps below:

  1. Open an M1 chart
  2. Press "F2" key to load History Center
  3. Navigate to the currency pair and the "1 Minute (M1)" history data for the chart you have open in your terminal (be sure to "double click" the "1 Minute (M1)" selection in history center so it becomes the active selection)
  4. Then left-click once on any of the data rows in the right-hand window of the History Center (it doesn't matter which one)
  5. Click the "_Add_ " button, this pops up another window titled "Bar" and the default selection is on the "year"
  6. Enter 1970
  7. Then select "_OK_ "... and it creates a new bar with the timestamp and price info you just added.
  8. Now select "_Close_ " in the History Center
  9. Attached a script located under "Scripts" folder (with _v2v_dynamic_system.zip_) >>> Attached this to your chart: _ForceLoadHistoricalData.ex4_
  10. Navigate to your M1 chart of interest and then from the terminal window (press _Ctrl-T_) select "_Journal_ "-> go to main chart window and _right-click mouse button_ and select "_Refresh_ "...this will refresh the chart and attempts to fill any time gaps in the chart data (which now includes your year 1970 data point) with server data  
Step 10 continued...Now your chart will have pulled anywhere from 2048 to 65536 M1 bars from your broker's server (not Metaquotes server) and is usually far more data than you can get the broker to cough up when you try and manually scroll your M1 chart back in time

  
If everything went fine... then you've quickly downloaded all the broker's M1 data on your currency pair that the broker is going to let you have, much faster than holding down the home or page-up key for minutes and minutes to download even fewer data. Now, you may continue with the rest of the time frames. But, don't forget to delete the year 1970 dummy tick data after it downloads more history, then you may need to check & verify if after the deletion (1970 record) if still got maximum historical data has been downloaded otherwise add 1970 record once again.

If you experienced the **greyed out ( unclickable elements ) MT4 toolbar issue** whenever you are loading custom indicator(s) that use tick data (volume history) extensively, which usually happens upon loading the **v2v dynamic trading system**. And more often (with MT4 demo servers due to connection/latency issue) if you closed your MT4 platform while more than one chart/instrument or pair are getting loaded (more frequently from the previous release). Now with the current release (get it from the shared link below), you might not experience this issue anymore as the entire system won't load up completely unless the connection to your broker's MT4 server(s) (demo or real) has been established successfully.

*** **optional solution** : Reload your template (the default or v2v dynamic system) on your chart or switch to another timeframe (e.g. from M30 to H1)

**v2v dynamic trading system: **_profile loading... and greyed out ( unclickable elements) MT4 toolbar prevention_

  1. Added greyed out toolbar prevention code... and removed unwanted objects due to on-load failure
  2. New default parameter values
  3. Since intuition can be trained... And so as your eyes and brain in order to see the divergence/convergence. With that, I removed TDZ's divergence signal to prevent a possible false signal creeping up to your analytical mind.
  4. New template and custom profile

I just wanted to add or to reiterate (without sounding rude), that this v2v dynamic trading system is not for noobs, and I won't say it that this system or indicators are for noobs as it would tend to sound not a good trading tool to have ; )─ I just meant that it requires greater experience to understand how the system works. Otherwise, look for another trading system that makes you think less and adhere to the mantra of the KISS approach.  
  
This is not a trading system that shows you a buy or a sell signal. It is a trading system that makes you a responsible trader that uses more of your brainpower and not just simply waiting for a buy & sell signal or a pattern to form. This system will let you create your own combination of confluences/setups and produced your own technical baseline bias before any type of price action shows up on your chart.

Dear, v2vboni  
  
I see you have attached the impulse element of Momentics to your system. You have made the great stuff and the enourmous work, pal ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44b.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44b.png?v=15.1).  
As you can see I relate myself to science, and many years ago the subject I would like to discover here once again was already discussed at FF.  
It is the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process what could describe the volatility of financial instruments much more carefully than those to be used in momentum indicators.  
Here I have attached the PDF file of a scientfic paper written by two scientists from Russia (that is why the paper is in cyrillic). The paper title could roughly be translated as Empirical model for stochastic volatility of financial fluctuations. In two words there are mathematical (they are difficult to understand somehow) calculations for the volatility dissipation process being held after an impulse. Take it at a glance - you might find it helpful for your endeavors.

**Period of Dominant Cycle**  
  
_Based on_ **Homodyne Discriminator** _by John F. Ehlers_  
  
_This type of algorithm exhibits superior performance in a low signal-to-noise environment._  
  
**Homodyne** _means I use the signal multiplied by itself one bar ago to produce a zero-frequency beat note. This beat note carries the phase angle of the one-bar change. Still using the basic definition of a cycle, the one-bar rate of change of phase is exactly the cycle period._  
  
**Note:**_This indicator does not generate BUY / SELL signals. It is used to find the cycle period that can be used as inputs to other indicators. For example, if the current value of the indicator is 32, then it means that the current cycle period of the price is 32 bars, and this value can be used to calculated period based indicators like RSI, ADX, CCI, ATR, etc. Since this indicator value changes, we calculate our indicators like RSI dynamically (32-bar), etc instead of a fixed RSI period._  
  
_This screenshot below shows some indicators that use the value of the dominant cycle period. This is just an example of a trading system or a tool that uses the Dominant Cycle Period. ─an upcoming version of the v2v dynamic trading system, but without the cycle period line showing up on the chart sub-window._

**v2v dynamic trading system** : _**Updates**_  
  
Now with _**Dominant Cycle Period**_ (based on **Homodyne Discriminator** by John F. Ehlers) as an option to change the default Period dynamically.  
  
This type of algorithm exhibits superior performance in a low signal-to-noise environment. _**Homodyne** _means I use the signal multiplied by itself one bar ago to produce a zero-frequency beat note. This beat note carries the phase angle of the one-bar change. Still using the basic definition of a cycle, the one-bar rate of change of phase is exactly the cycle period.

  1. Added toggle button to use the Dominant Cycle Period option to change the default Period dynamically for the following tools...

    1. VP-Range: ATR/ADR bands calculation and period
    2. VWAP: ATR/ADR bands calculation & period
    3. TDZ: the dynamic zone top, mid and bottom bands only
    4. v2v Momenticks: period

  2. New template, profile and default parameter values

**Tip of the day**  
  
A much better way to reload the current state of your default (loaded) MT4 profile with multiple charts. However, make sure that the navigational elements pointed out on the chart below are not grayed out before using the script and/or loading your default profile and template.

**Tip of the day**  
  
Not able to load properly the v2v dynamic trading system on your MT4 platform? Probably you don't have enough historical data that are required by Volume Profile and Pivot Fibs plus indicator.

Hi V2v  
  
The earlier versions of your pivot indicator have the vpr.VWAP label to be functional.  
But the last ones have none of it.  
  
So the suggestion is to add a bunch of labels for the VWAP legacy (an additional button).  
  
They are  
  
Current WEEK's VWAP  
Previous WEEK's VWAP  
Current Month's VWAP  
Previous Month's VWAP  
Current Quartal's VWAP  
Previous Quartal's VWAP  
VWAP from Year’s beginning  
  
the label should have 2 edges from the central point.  
these 2 edges are the 0,341 of a standart deviation from the last price labeled.  
  
0,341 is 34,1%  
34,1%*2 = 68,2% equals to one sigma  
  
Best  
D.P.

**Volumes on Main Chart** bars are based on tick volume... It is very useful when you know about price action in view of normal Japanese candle bars in the combination with Heiken Ashi Bars (APB average price bars, wick length, trend, direction, color change, etc...) and as well in candlestick math (check YouTube) price action.  
  
The attached image will give you the rest of the things about Volumes on MainChart. If the shared information seems not enough, just don't use this tool or the v2v dynamic trading system.

Hi, V2v,  
  
Reading the above book, I just confronted with some kind of approach - here it is below at the chart. However, this apporach is a theoretical one. The question - is the 20 bar approximation enough? I mean, is there any difference between the 20, 30 or, say, 40 bar "window" to achieve the same results at the same inputs (the amplitude of Signal-to-Noise Ratio at the chart)?  
  
Did you try finding the mentioned difference in order to understand the wider "window" is not already needful for the approach, and the 20 bar approximation is necessary and sufficient?  
  
Best  
D.P.  
  
P.S. New questions are possible.

I only got a summarized answer to those questions about theoretical data/information... an endless frontier of approximation of enough and not enough.  
  
By the way, I am taking a rest in terms of coding at this time of the year.  
  
Thanks for the input.

V2vbony, I have seen your discussion with DonPato at his thread and must say you were discussing about the same things but different manners.  
  
I thought what if, using the J.Perl concept (see at the picture below), some kind of signals might be generated, these signals could be found out by means of relations between VWAP (1H and 4H) and PVP (1H and 4H), what could you say? this is just an idea to think of...  
  
At the picture:  
1/ the red curves are for VWAPs @ 1H  
2/ the vertical black arrows are for price directions  
3/ the horizontal black arrows are for PVP @ 1H  
4/ the magenta curve is for VWAP @ 4H  
5/ the blue horizontal arrow is for PVP @ 4H  
  
Best  
D.P.  
  
P.S. find an exhaustion bar at the picture youself ))

This works... but not all the time. The same with other concepts or strategies out there. It's just a matter of higher probabilities and/or consistencies, it provides over a period of time while constantly adapting to an ever-changing and highly efficient market.  
  
The main purpose of v2v dynamic trading system is to see possible price inflection points in order to identify viable entry/exits in view of Technical Analysis armed with you own generated Fundamental bias (without this, is all up to you). Like for example: I received a DM from another platform thanking me as he was able to generate his own strategy using this system by using HA-APB price channel with TDZ indicator only with almost 80% winners.  
  
Anyway, at the end of the day, it is you and you alone who can figure out what works and what doesn’t.

Hi, V2vboni  
  
Just played with TDZ-Momentics,  
1/ I would like to ask if there is a possibility to have 2 (and more) instances TDZs in a chart?  
2/ It there a possibility to switch MTF to a predefined TF, say, D for example?

By changing the _UniqueID_ parameter value, it can have more than one instance of TDZ indicator (but buggy: it should have been removed much earlier). However, this parameter would be removed on the next upload (the same will be done for other indicators: just a bit enforcing to use v2v system only) as the current code structure has been changed due to visual inaccuracy in MTF mode with larger TF intervals (in-between: e.g. M1-M15, M5-M30, M30-H4, H1-D1, and D1-MN1 ). Hence, it's always better to use the next TF (activate MTF mode button) or move to another TF as desired.

The chart image summarizes the relative position of an exchange rate relative to its performance over the last year. The yellow background indicates the square dimension of the chart. The orange dot indicates today's position relative to the high (top of the chart) and low (bottom of the chart) of the FX index during the last 365 days. So if the orange dot is close to the top, the currency is close to its highest valuation. If the orange dot is close to the bottom, the currency is near its lowest valuation. The blue bars indicate the distribution of valuations over the course of one year. The span between high and low valuation is divided into ten ranges (ie, deciles). Then the number of days during which the currency's valuation has been in each of these deciles is counted. The number of days is proportional to the width of each of the ten blue bars. Thus the position of the orange dot relative to the width of the blue bars indicates if the current valuation is a relatively common event or a relatively rare event. For example, if the bulk of valuations has been in the lower deciles, and the orange dot is near the top where the bars are narrow, the currency has recently moved up sharply. The chart ("FX conifers") is a simple method of visually summarizing the performance of a currency over the time period of one year. One useful feature of this chart is that it automatically adjusts for the different volatility of currencies, as the span between a one-year high and one-year low is a reflection of a currency's volatility.

T3 based VWAP

✔ T3 by Tim Tillson  
Tim Tillson is a software project manager at Hewlett-Packard, with degrees in Mathematics and Computer Science. He has privately traded options and equities for 15 years.  
  
"Digital filtering includes the process of smoothing, predicting, differentiating, integrating, separation of signals, and removal of noise from a signal. Thus many people who do such things are using digital filters without realizing that they are; being unacquainted with the theory, they neither understand what they have done nor the possibilities of what they might have done."  
  
This quote from R. W. Hamming applies to the vast majority of indicators in technical analysis. Moving averages, be they simple, weighted, or exponential, are lowpass filters; low-frequency components in the signal pass through with little attenuation, while high frequencies are severely reduced. "Oscillator" type indicators (such as MACD, Momentum, Relative Strength Index) are another type of digital filter called a differentiator. Tushar Chande has observed that many popular oscillators are highly correlated, which is sensible because they are trying to measure the rate of change of the underlying time series, i.e., are trying to be the first and second derivatives we all learned about in Calculus.  
  
We use moving averages (lowpass filters) in technical analysis to remove the random noise from a time series, to discern the underlying trend or to determine prices at which we will take action. A perfect moving average would have two attributes:  
  
It would be smooth, not sensitive to random noise in the underlying time series. Another way of saying this is that its derivative would not spuriously alternate between positive and negative values.  
  
It would not lag behind the time series it is computed from. Lag, of course, produces late buy or sell signals that kill profits.  
The only way one can compute a perfect moving average is to know the future, and if we had that, we would buy one lottery ticket a week rather than trade!

Yes, I removed that as it may cause an information overload  
  
RES/SES button is just for resetting the current vertical line guides for both Volume Profile and VWAP indicator Range  
  
RES = Reset (SES active to Reset)  
SES = I can't think of any other 3-letter to name it. This is just a fail-safe so users won't be able to clear the current vertical line guide position accidentally. Thus, at times it needed to cycle with the two-button state.  
  
Users may need to exercise their memory retention or brainpower when using this system. No need to spoonfed a lot. This is a FREE system, I don't care how many traders who will use it or found it useless.

I have got it all. The last (for now) Q. Do I right understand that you have made smoothing VPR-VWAP with T3? and left the original VWAP "as is" (legacy) at the same time? That is why they are a little bit different, is that?

No, T3 based VWAP (VP-R & VWAP indicator) uses vertical line guides (from & to) custom range, but not unless you plot manually with the same range as the VWAP legacy.   
  
T3 VWAP is using the following filtering/smoothed technology

  1. HMA-DSMA
  2. Jurik
  3. MomenTicks

Thanks. But I have 2 Q to ask  
1/ What parameters does Legacy VWAP option influence on?  
2/ Wt.Close - what is it?  
3/ Do you expect Quartal VWAP?  
  
At last, I have found a suggestion to be realized. You have been using the "MTF" button at the lower indicators. Could you please shift this button directly to the "RSI Classic" button? Or made an option to shift it out... Yes, you can say this option already exists - but this option shifts both of buttons left or right at the same time.  
  
Best

As designed... No legacy option for both indicator that uses range-bound ( using vertical line guides - from & to ) VWAP of VP-R_MomenTicks & VWAP_MomenTicks. The Legacy VWAP only shows within horizontal volume bars of VP-R_MomenTicks, and horizontal lines of PIVOT FIBS plus indicator.  
  
Wt = weighted but I just changed it along with the others on the next upload.

  1. Typical = **pivot FIBS**
  2. s.Open = session open
  3. w.Open = weighted open
  4. p.Close = previous close
  5. w.Close = weighted close
  6. p.High = previous high
  7. p.Low = previous low
  8. PVP = peak volume price... a.k.a. POC = point of control ─ **pvp FIBS**
  9. VWAP = volume weighted average price ─ **vwap FIBS**

For ADR range button:

  1. cur.Pivot = current pivot
  2. prev.Pivot = previous pivot
  3. cur.VWAP = current vwap
  4. prev.VWAP = previous vwap
  5. cur.PVP = current pvp
  6. prev.PVP = previous PVP
  7. vpr.PVP = volume profile range pvp
  8. vpr.VWAP = volume profile range vwap

  
Quarterly/Yearly for PVP & VWAP can't be done at the moment, as it needs a massive restructuring ( a lot of coding work ). For now, I suggest using the range-bound VWAP feature instead.  
  
The other features with regards to the button on left ( e.g. RSI Classic ) will remain due to information ( limited text length if covered ) next to it. Thus, the button on the right ( MTF ) will remain.

V2vboni, I meant as follows - yes, the button will remain, but its position on the screen should be shifted to the position of RSI button (left), if possible.  
Look at the picture below. You can not see the MTF button, if the chart is one half (or one third) of the whole screen.

thanks!  
  
I was using 4 monitors in front of me and I got used to a full-screen chart. Anyhow, I move the button and parameter info.

Still, a long way to go for this _**v2v dynamic trading system**_  
  
But, for now... This **Game Changer Edition** will not be updated for some time. Next... Hopefully, making an MT5 release.  
  
Although, there are a couple of features I wish to add with this system...

  1. Position sizing ( I have an existing one that needs some work to be done )  
─ Auto/Manual ATR based calculation that dynamically adjusts the ATR based bands of two VP-R indicator  
─ TP, SL, and BE target  
─ Pip & Amount counter

...was doing some code optimizations with this system and I had a logical break in-between when suddenly on my YouTube channel subscription with TMZ shows live video footage on news about Kobe died in a helicopter accident. So, I said to myself, this can't be true... Then, I immediately went to the CNN site and Yahoo.com to verify. Nothing was there at all. I suspected it just might be fake news. But after 10 minutes... it started to be in everybody's news site.

**※****Traders D****ynamic Zones ( TDZ )**  
  
This indicator is a hybrid TDI that uses the same RSI core... BUT with a lot of twists inside. Thus, it became a one-of-a-kind oscillator that is uniquely different from the traditional TDI.  
  
Here are the following TDZ features & functions:   
  
☛ Dynamic Zones by Leo Zamansky Ph.D. and David Stendahl  
  
The Dynamic Zone indicator can elaborately show how it solves common trading complications. Extreme investing employs the use of oscillators to exploit tradable trends in the market. This style of investing follows a very simple form of logic: only enter the market when an oscillator has moved far above or below traditional trading levels. However, these indicator driven systems, cannot evolve with the market because they use the fixed buy and sell zones. Traders typically use one set of buy and sell zones for a bull market and substantially different zones for a bear market.   
  
Herein lies the complications. Once traders begin introducing their market opinions into trading equations, by changing the zones, they negate the system's mechanical nature. The objective is to have a system automatically define its own buy and sell zones and thereby profitably trade in any market -- bull or bear. Dynamic Zones offer a solution to the complications of fixed buy and sell zones for any indicator driven systems.  
  
  
☛ Jurik filter ─ phase and smoothing   
  
This TDI version uses JMA's (Jurik Research Moving Average) phase and smoothing calculation. Have you noticed how moving averages add some lag (delay) to your signals? ... especially when price gaps up or down in a big move, and you are waiting for your moving average to catch up? Wait no more! JMA eliminates these complications forever and gives you the best of both worlds: low lag and smooth lines.   
  
Ideally, for instance, a filtered signal may both be smooth and lag-free. Lag causes delays in your trades, and increasing lag in your indicators typically results in lower profits. In other words, latecomers get what's left on the table after the feast has already begun. The JMA's improved timing and smoothness will astound you.  
JMA is a powerful adaptive tracker that can smooth time series data with a very small lag, no overshoots and no oscillations. The algorithm is stable and avoids the complexities of neural networks. JMA delivers the best all-around performance for smoothness, accuracy, and timeliness.  
  
  
☛ RSI-Trend Strength Index (RSX) by Mark Jurik  
  
RSI is a very popular technical indicator because it takes into consideration market speed, direction, and trend uniformity. However, its widely criticized drawback is its noisy (jittery) appearance. The RSX retains all the useful features of RSI, but with one important exception: the noise is gone with no added lag.  
  
  
☛ Best Formula: Using Average Price Bar ( APB ) calculation for calculating Price parameter   
  
Average Price Bars provide a better depiction of the current market by eliminating or reducing fluctuations in nominal price action often referred to as “choppiness” of current High, Low, and Close price action. In other words, APB removes the noise of price distortion.  
  
  
☛ Uses Hull MA (by Allan Hull) but this one is a variation from Low lag to zero-lag   
  
There are many types of moving averages, the most basic being the Simple Moving Average (SMA). Of all the moving averages the SMA lags price the most. The Exponential and Weighted Moving Averages were developed to address this lag by placing more emphasis on more recent data. The Hull Moving Average (HMA), developed by Allan Hull, is an extremely fast and smooth moving average. The HMA almost eliminates lag and manages to improve smoothing at the same time. With TDZ indicator combined with Hull MA variation with Jurik filters, and phase & smoothing that ultimately eliminates lagging.   
  
  
☛ Ehler's Deviation-Scaled Moving Average ( DSMA )   
  
The new DSMA made by John Ehlers and featured in the July 2018 issue of TASC magazine. The DSMA is a data smoothing technique that acts as an exponential moving average with a dynamic smoothing coefficient. The smoothing coefficient is automatically updated based on the magnitude of price changes. In the Deviation-Scaled Moving Average, the standard deviation from the mean is chosen to be the measure of this magnitude. The resulting indicator provides substantial smoothing of the data even when price changes are small while quickly adapting to these changes.  
  
  
☛ RSI & RSX haDelta   
  
haDelta is a simple formula originally developed and published by Mr. Dan Valcu. The idea behind haDelta is to quantify HA candles. By doing this, one can measure momentum and this is very important when you use haDelta for reversals. It measures the difference between HA Close and HA Open. Caution: High sensitivity if used.  
  
  
☛ Vertical Horizontal Filter ( VHF )  
  
Vertical Horizontal Filter (VHF) was created by Adam White to identify trending and ranging markets. VHF measures the level of trend activity, similar to ADX in the Directional Movement System. Trend indicators can then be employed in trending markets and momentum indicators in ranging markets.  
  
  
☛ T3 (TRIX) by Tim Tillson  
  
The reason for the development of this moving average was to improve the noise filter and decrease a lag, presented in most of the moving averages. The indicator is based on multiple exponential smoothing of price.   
  
  
☛ Dominant Cycle Period ( DCP )   
  
The DCP generated value is being used as a dynamic Period parameter value (for TDZ bands).   
Based on Homodyne Discriminator by John F. Ehlers, Rocket Science for Traders >>> [here](https://www.forexfactory.com/attachment.php/3490859?attachmentid=3490859&d=1573920062). This type of algorithm exhibits superior performance in a low signal-to-noise environment.  
  
Homodyne means I use the signal multiplied by itself one bar ago to produce a zero-frequency beat note. This beat note carries the phase angle of the one-bar change. Still using the basic definition of a cycle, the one-bar rate of change of phase is exactly the cycle period.  
  
  
☛ Linear Momentum  
  
Linear momentum is defined as the product of a system's mass multiplied by its velocity. In symbols, linear momentum is expressed as p = mv. Momentum is directly proportional to the object's mass and also its velocity. Thus the greater an object's mass or the greater its velocity, the greater its momentum.

**Why v2v dynamic trading system tools have this kind of default parameter value?**

Answers:

  1. Unlike stock prices, most of the time FX pairs have a way more tendency to overshoots targets/prices due to a lot of factors in just a matter of seconds or minute(s) and then go back immediately to where it almost started in up & down or whipsaw price movement. Thus, most indicators suffer from this type of movement like a head-fake, that may act like an intentional/unintentional misdirection. Hence, it may produce false signals
  2. If this system doesn't have such process update delay parameter value, this system would greatly slow down the MT4 platform and you'll found this system unusable.
  3. With such a parameter option, you won't have multiple features that you could enjoy having with this system.
  4. The same goes for having such a feature to load a limited number of bars for processing to achieve faster rendering of MTF volume bars or data transformation.
  5. The update delay process works during normal volatility... BUT, it can be overridden by _FXV Volume on Main Chart_ tool for its volatility pips parameter (auto/manual) value. Once the pip threshold reached, it will trigger the update process of some tools within the system, and then reset back to the default process delay parameter value in minute(s).

**v2v dynamic trading system** : _**...Updates**_  
  
**_Montauk Edition_**

  1. v2v MomenTicks:  
  
Now with... Tick Volume Indicator ( TVI ) _by William Blau. _In his book "Momentum, Direction and Divergence" (1995). If you like to learn more, we advise you to read this book. His book focuses on three key aspects of trading: momentum, direction, and divergence. Blau, who was an electrical engineer before becoming a trader, thoroughly examines the relationship between price and momentum.  
  
TVI is calculated according to this formula:  
  
TVI = 100 x (DEMA(UpTicks) - DEMA(DownTicks))/(DEMA(UpTicks) + DEMA(DownTicks))  
  

  2. Typical Usage:  
  
The TVI helps identify whether buyers or sellers are in control. If the TVI is trending up, it indicates that buyers are in control. If the TVI is trending down, it indicates that sellers are in control. If the TVI is above zero, it indicates that net buying has taken place over the time period displayed. If the TVI is below zero, it indicates that net selling has taken place over the time period displayed.  
If a large number of trades are taking place at a specific price level (i.e., a flat spot forms on the tick chart) and the TVI is rising (falling), look for the price to break out on the upside (downside).

The Spearman study is a technical indicator used for the evaluation of trend strength and turning point detection. This study calculates Spearman's rank correlation coefficient in order to reveal the correlation between actual price changes and an extremely strong trend. The Spearman indicator registers two sets of data: prices of each bar during the specified period in their chronological order and the same prices sorted ascendingly.

  1. Updated Blau TVI using T3 MA calculation for Price

**v2v dynamic trading system** : _**...**__**a Project Looking Glass**_

  1. **v2v MomenTicks** :

    1. Added the **_Force MomenTicks_**  
  
The force index (a.k.a. Force MomenTicks under v2v dynamic setup) is a technical indicator that measures the amount of power used to move the price of an asset. The term and its formula were developed by psychologist and trader Alexander Elder and published in his 1993 book Trading for a Living. The force index uses price and volume to determine the amount of strength behind a price move. The index is an oscillator... but wait! Since it was fused under the v2v dynamic trading system, it can be called a Momencillator ( Linear-weighted momentum ─ TVI powered ) \- a Momentum and an Oscillator.  
  
The Force MomenTicks is used for trend and breakout confirmation, as well as spotting potential turning points.

**v2v dynamic trading system**  
  
  
**MomenTicks** is a **_Linear_ **(velocity ***** price) **/** **_Weighted_** (volume or tick data ***** velocity) **_Momentum_(LWM)**

  1. Fused the **Laguerre of RSI** with _TDZ MomenTicks_

    1. The existing code (Laguerre of RSI) made by David W. Thomas was based on John Ehler's Laguerre Filter to avoid the noise of RSI. However, IMHO the said filter flattens the underlying trends and then, resulting in a sudden change of direction (from flat to directional up or down). Thus, I applied DSMA (by John Ehler ─ TASC magazine 2019) and Jurik MA smoothing filters with LWM algorithm or under TDZ setup in order to see what's getting filtered.

  1. **This system welcomes...** **The** **[Singular Spectral Analysis ( SSA )](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_spectrum_analysis) ****of** _**MomenTicks**_  
  
Brief Wikipedia definition:   
  
"In time series analysis, singular spectrum analysis (SSA) is a nonparametric spectral estimation method. It combines elements of classical time series analysis, multivariate statistics, multivariate geometry, dynamical systems, and signal processing"

Basically this toll is an idea of how we can use this scientific tool as a technical analysis instrument. You do not need to understand in-depth what SSA is, you need to understand what it does. It decomposes the time series and then reconstructs them.   
  
Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) is a method that takes all the variability in a series and breaks it into a few oscillation patterns that we refer to as eigenvectors. It also gives a measure of the significance of these patterns or eigenvalues.   
  
“Eigen” is a German word, which roughly translates to “characteristic”. Eigenvectors are structure functions that best represent the modes of behavior in price. The eigenvalues are a measure of the variance that these modes account for. The eigenvectors can be ordered by eigenvalue, highest to lowest, so that the first few patterns retain most of the variance in the data. The ordered eigenvalues are referred to collectively as the Singular Spectrum.

─ A higher number of SSA bars: Smoother results   
─ A lower number of Lag SSA bars: Sharper results  
─ A higher number of Computations: Sharper result  
─ A less number of Computations: Smoother results   
  

  2. Based on the original SSA of Price (advanced) by mladen with the required library file ( libSSA.dll ).
  3. As a guest tool for v2v dynamic trading system, you need to attach this tool manually (not included on v2v dynamic template) on your chart.
  4. Note: This is just the beginning of its integration to v2v dynamic trading system

**Tip of the day**

  1. Using _Dominant Cycle Period ( DCP )_ as Lag length for _Singular Spectral Analysis_ tool 
  2. This may get automated soon as the process of improvements or enhancement continues for this system

**v2v dynamic trading system** : _**... a Project Looking Glass**_

  1. **v2v MomenTicks**  
  
─ **Volatility Ratio** : Now using a default Period value of 25 but it can change dynamically by getting the maximum value between the default Period of 25 vs the value of Dominant Cycle Period (DCP) divided by 3 (not divided in MTF & DCP mode is ON). The data is derived from the Standard Deviation of Price (close) and _powered by_ MomenTicks  
  
─ **Synthetic VIX (SVIX) Ratio (****New****)** : By default, the Period value is 20 but it can change dynamically by getting the maximum value between the default Period of 20 vs the value of Dominant Cycle Period (DCP) divided by 3 (not divided in MTF & DCP mode is ON). The data is derived from the Standard Deviation of Price (close) and _powered by_ MomenTicks.  
  
This is based on the original research/studies of Larry Williams (activetradermag.com, December 2007), The VIX Fix. ─ A “synthetic” VIX calculation can be used in any market to reproduce the performance of the well-known volatility index.  
  
This SVIX Ratio allows traders to gauge the securities that do not have an official CBOE VIX ticker symbol.  
  
Both SVIX and Volatility Ratio explores the momentum and price ranges relative to relevant securities (stocks, CFDs or currency pairs) closing prices over a prescribed period.

**v2v dynamic trading system** : _**... a Project Looking Glass**_

  1. **v2v MomenTicks**  
  
─ **Volatility** and **Synthetic VIX (SVIX) Ratio** has been updated, and it is now using an **Adaptive Deviation** (previously using a Standard Deviation calculation)  
  
_The difference when compared to standard is significant - not just because of ema usage, but the efficiency ratio is making it a "bit more logical" in very volatile market conditions. ─_ _mladen_

**v2v dynamic trading system** : _**... a Project Looking Glass**_

  1. **v2v MomenTicks**  
  
─ Removed **Volatility Ratio** and kept **Synthetic VIX (SVIX)** to avoid redundancy or technical analysis paralysis about volatility.  
─ Fixed issue with DCP & MTF button behavior or interaction with v2v MomenTicks.

**v2v dynamic trading system** : _**... a Project Looking Glass**_

  1. **v2v MomenTicks**  
  
─ Now... **Laguerre MomenTicks** is using an **Adaptive Deviation.**  
  

  2. **Singular Spectrum Analysis ( SSA ) of MomenTicks**  
  
─ Updated the internal dynamic calculation of **Jurik filters**.  
  
─ Just to be clear... **SSA** is originally designed as a recalculating algorithm. Thus, it looks to repaint from time-to-time.   
  
─ This tool is not ideal to view on a chart lower than M30 TF (overshooting linear MomenTicks' line issue).  
  
─ In full integration or in the next release, this **SSA of MomenTicks** will be showing like a normal Japanese candlestick bars on-chart but colored based on slope change.   
  
─ Since **SSA of MomenTicks** recalculates, you may view this tool just like an MTF mode of Heiken Ashi bars.   
  
─ And of course, no single tool of v2v dynamic trading system that can be used as a sole indicator that helps manage your trading positions or position your positions accordingly.  
  
─ However, if you wanted to use another variation of SSA which doesn't repaint, simply google search "_SSA normalized end-pointed_ ".  
  
─ Anyway, this is just a guess indicator at the moment, you may remove it as you wish.

─ Again, just to be clear... **SSA** _is originally designed (based on the exact science of SSA) as a recalculating algorithm_. Thus, the slope color change repaints from time-to-time.  
  
─ Since **SSA of MomenTicks** recalculates, you may view this tool just like an MTF mode of Heiken Ashi bars. Hence, you may adjust the parameters according to your own way of using it. Come to think of it, those time-based charts such as 1-minute, 15-minute or 4-hour also “repaints or recalculates” the same exact way.  
  
─ And of course, this tool cannot simply use as the sole indicator that helps manage your trading positions or position your positions accordingly.   
  
\- A higher number of SSA bars: Smoother results  
\- A lower number of Lag SSA bars: Sharper results  
\- A higher number of Computations: Sharper result  
\- A less number of Computations: Smoother results

(1995) Kaleidoscope World  
  
So many faces, so many races Different voices, different choices Some are mad, while others laugh Some live alone with no better half Others grieve while others curse And others mourn behind a big black hearse Some are pure and some half-bred Some are sober and some are wasted Some are rich because of fate and Some are poor with no food on their plate Some stand out while others blend Some are fat and stout while some are thin Some are friends and some are foes Some have some while some have most Every color and every hue Is represented by me and you Take a slide in the slope Take a look in the kaleidoscope Spinnin' round, make it twirl In this kaleidoscope world Some are great and some are few Others lie while some tell the truth Some say poems and some do sing Others sing through their guitar strings Some know it all while some act dumb Let the bass line strum to the bang of the drum Some can swim while some will sink And some will find their minds and think Others walk while others run You can't talk peace and have a gun Some are hurt and start to cry Don't ask me how don't ask me why Some are friends and some are foes Some have some while some have most Every color and every hue Is represented by me and you Take a slide in the slope Take a look in the kaleidoscope Spinnin' round, make it twirl In this kaleidoscope world Kaleidoscope world In this kaleidoscope world

**_Added a new member to the family..._****Regression Analysis ( RA )****for VP-R tools**  
  
─ Based on the original works by [Boris Armenteros](https://www.mql5.com/en/code/10249): Regression Analysis 2.0  
─ This **v2v RA for VP-R** works **ONLY** for _v2v dynamic trading system_  
─ New templates

  1. On the next update, I may add navigation buttons (data point range) to jump from one VP-R tool to another
  2. and probably add the following...  
─ DCP based calculation  
─ Linear-Volume Weighted Price (not sure though)

==============================================  
**A****must****before loading the v2v dynamic trading system****(****new steps****)**  
==============================================  
**Follow the steps below:**

  1. Open an M1 chart
  2. Press "F2" key to load History Center
  3. Navigate to the currency pair and the "1 Minute (M1)" history data for the chart you have open in your terminal (be sure to "double click" the "1 Minute (M1)" selection in history center so it becomes the active selection)
  4. Then left-click once on any of the data rows in the right-hand window of the History Center (it doesn't matter which one)
  5. Click the "_Add_ " button, this pops up another window titled "Bar" and the default selection is on the "year"
  6. Enter 1970
  7. Then select "_OK_ "... and it creates a new bar with the timestamp and price info you just added.
  8. Now select "_Close_ " in the History Center
  9. Attached a script located under "Scripts" folder (with _v2v_dynamic_system.zip_) >>> Attached this to your chart: _ForceLoadHistoricalData.ex4_
  10. Navigate to your M1 chart of interest and then from the terminal window (press _Ctrl-T_) select "_Journal_ "-> go to main chart window and _right-click mouse button_ and select "_Refresh_ "...this will refresh the chart and attempts to fill any time gaps in the chart data (which now includes your year 1970 data point) with server data  
  
─ Step 10 continued...Now your chart will have pulled anywhere from 2048 to 65536 M1 bars from your broker's server (not Metaquotes server) and is usually far more data than you can get the broker to cough up when you try and manually scroll your M1 chart back in time.

If everything went fine... then you've quickly downloaded all the broker's M1 data on your currency pair that the broker is going to let you have, much faster than holding down the home or page-up key for minutes and minutes to download even fewer data. Now, you may continue with the rest of the time frames. But, don't forget to delete the year 1970 dummy tick data after it downloads more history, then you may need to check & verify if after the deletion (1970 record) if still got maximum historical data has been downloaded otherwise add 1970 record once again.

The system is getting bigger and bigger...  
  
I had this on my note last year and not able to get it done. Thanks for reminding me. On the next updates, it will be included.  
  
Thanks again.

It looks very good, but according to my analysis atr does not work with z scores. The better way to calculate volatility is by using  
Average(MathLog(MathAbs(close /close[1])))  
  
Then use sqrt(time) to project the zscore boundaries..  
  
This is very suitable with Z-Scores.. Make sure you use a long period for the average, at least a week worth of data on 5 minute chart.  
Just my 2 cents..

Thanks for the reply, I look into it more and see how it goes.  
  
I initially did just like that or based on what abokwaik has done with your suggested calculation. Although I did not explore that much of it as I have an existing calculation of ATR values that I must use for VWAP as the center due to the perceived notion of the price is above or above the center (VWAP) ─combining the anchored VWAP approach and the so-called MIDAS.  
  
On the other hand, the regression channel seems near to what you have suggested >>> check the original works >>> [here](https://www.mql5.com/en/code/10249)  
  
Sample Code:  

Inserted Code
    
    
     
      if(Close[1] >= 10000 || Close[1] >=2000) divshift = 1000; else divshift = 1.00;
      
      if (UseAR == ATR) iShift = GetATR();   // ATR selected ( calculated in PIPS )
     
      iShift *= GetZscores()/divshift; 
     
      workShiftBars = (int)floor(MathSqrt(iShift*(fmax(0.25,ShiftedMultiplier))))
     
    ...
    ...
    ...
       posVWAP[pos] = VWAP[pos]+VWAP[pos]*( (workShiftBars*1.96/2) )/1000;
       negVWAP[pos] = VWAP[pos]-VWAP[pos]*( (workShiftBars*1.96/2) )/1000;
       resVWAP[pos] = VWAP[pos]+VWAP[pos]*( (workShiftBars*2.58/2) )/1000;
       supVWAP[pos] = VWAP[pos]-VWAP[pos]*( (workShiftBars*2.58/2) )/1000;
       posSD1[pos]  = VWAP[pos]+VWAP[pos]*( (workShiftBars*1.28/2) )/1000;
       negSD1[pos]  = VWAP[pos]-VWAP[pos]*( (workShiftBars*1.28/2) )/1000;
       SD1pos[pos]  = VWAP[pos]+VWAP[pos]*( (workShiftBars*1.00/2) )/1000;
       SD1neg[pos]  = VWAP[pos]-VWAP[pos]*( (workShiftBars*1.00/2) )/1000;

  1. Statistical: Mean, Deciles and Quantiles-Quartiles ─ Percentile has been added.  
  
In statistics and probability quantiles are cut points dividing the range of a probability distribution into continuous intervals with equal probabilities, or dividing the observations in a sample in the same way. There is one fewer quantile than the number of groups created. Thus quartiles are the three cut points that will divide a dataset into four equal-sized groups. Common quantiles have special names: for instance quartile, decile (creating 10 groups: see below for more). The groups created are termed halves, thirds, quarters, etc., though sometimes the terms for the quantile are used for the groups created, rather than for the cut points.   
  
A **[Quartile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile)** is a type of quantile which divides the number of data points into four more or less equal parts or quarters.

The **first quartile (Q1)** is defined as the middle number between the smallest number and the median of the data set. It is also known as the lower quartile or the 25th empirical quartile and it marks where 25% of the data is below or to the left of it (if data is ordered on a timeline from smallest to largest).

  
The **second quartile (Q2)** is the median of a data set and 50% of the data lies below this point.

  
The**third quartile (Q3)** is the middle value between the median and the highest value of the data set. It is also known as the upper quartile or the 75th empirical quartile and 75% of the data lies below this point. Due to the fact that the data needs to be ordered from smallest to largest in order to compute quartiles, quartiles are a form of Order statistic.

In descriptive statistics, the **interquartile range (IQR)****,** also called the midspread, middle 50%, or H‑spread, is a measure of statistical dispersion, being equal to the difference between 75th and 25th percentiles, or between upper and lower quartiles, _IQR = Q3 − Q1_. In other words, the IQR is the first quartile subtracted from the third quartile; these quartiles can be clearly seen on a box plot on theles; and they are denoted by Q1, Q2, and Q3, respectively.

  

The IQR of a set of values is calculated as the difference between the upper and lower quartiles, Q3 and Q1. Each quartile is a median calculated as follows. Given an even _2n or odd 2n+1_ number of values.

  

first quartile _Q1 = median of the n smallest values_  
third quartile _Q3 = median of the n largest values_

second quartile _Q2 is the same as the ordinary median. _

**─ PIVOT FIB plus:** A new pivot was born... And this aside from the previously v2v created PVP & VWAP based pivot.

  1. Now, welcomes the **50th percentile** or [Quantile](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=12866411#post12866411) Median Pivot Fibs  
Note: When switching from one pivot to another, the calculated dots method for high & low-level lines moves accordingly. If you are not familiar with the D.O.T.S. method, try to research about it using Google or YouTube.
  2. Restored previous default period parameter to 9 (minimum of 6)
  3. Improved execution process for faster quantile switches

  
**─ Volume on Main Chart: **Volume/Volatility dashboard

  1. Added a corner location hidden switch

Start observing these levels once it gained respect from price or after giving it some room to breathe in a VWAP-like type of observation. And then, in combination with a perceived exhaustion level(s) wherein price respecting the ADR or ATR range (...looking at lower or upper range values) inside VWAP channels (with inside shifted VWAP z-score levels). Then, come up with an estimation of price boundaries.  
  
In Quartiles:

  1. Given that Q2 is the Median (50th percentile)
  2. Q1 (25% of the data is below) is the median of the lower half of Q2
  3. And Q3 (75% of the data lies below this point) is the median of the upper half of Q2

With that... Now, start looking for inefficiency or inequality to come to the perceived price boundaries.  
  
On the lower half:  
If the Price is deviating down and away from the Q2 median (50th percentile) and lower than Q1, then look for possible inflection points, such as tick-volume clusters build-up at the previous or current session range and/or from the set range. Observe the price movement/behavior in touching the said levels as it moves with the current data.  
  
On the upper half:  
If the Price is deviating higher and away from the Q2 median (50th percentile) and higher than Q3, then look for possible inflection points, such as tick-volume clusters build-up at the previous or current session range and/or from the set range. Observe the price movement/behavior in touching the said levels as it moves with the current data.  
  
Then... add an effective decision-making process such as a tried & tested technical analysis (e.g. price auction, accumulation/distribution, swing trading) and/or in a combination of fundamental/sentimental bias or whichever comes first.   
  
I can't simply provide a viable trigger with this system which is designed towards more to the discretionary type of a trader.

**The most underrated tool** within the **v2v dynamic trading system** is the **_Neural Network ─ T3 HMA-DSMA with Jurik filtering._**  
  
Part of the reason is that, just like the Volume Profile tool, Neural Network uses a lot of CPU resources or computing power on a trading platform, such as MT4. Also, with regards to usage. The majority of the users are simply looking for an easy or fast tool that spoonfed them with a Buy or Sell signal instantly. Hence, some shy away from using this kind of tool.  
  
In these times, Neural Network is being used more recently in a lot of things in the fields of Science & Technology.   
  
Anyhow, here is my CoT data customized report:

**[v2v dynamic trading system](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=901713) _: ... a Project Looking Glass_**  
  
  
Artificial neural networks (ANN) are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. An ANN is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain.  
  
**Neural Network ─ Jurik & DSMA Filtered T3-HMA**  
  
This T3-NN is the most underrated tool within the v2v dynamic trading system. Since the science behind the Neural Network itself requires a lot of computing power to get process, Hence, some of the retail traders simply shy away from using this kind of tool.  
  
In these times, an A.I. based Neural Network in the fields of Science & Technology has exponentially increased due to advanced computing power available. And more recently in the medical field wherein, they used Neural Network Artificial Intelligence to find post-infection treatment (Remdesivir) for COVID-19  
  
  
**Updates:**

  1. Applied the **MomenTicks** algo
  2. Added DCP ( as default ) for the value of Future Bars
  3. Added data horizon value from the VP-R tool to generate the number of bars for Training Sets.
  4. Fused the work data source parameter based selection ala VP-R tool ( tick/volume data TF )

ouch!  
  
Dear, v2vboni, may I expect the system being transferred to MT5?  
  
Best  
D.P.  
  
P.S. I have some tools to suggest to be integrated into the system, but I'd rather to suggest them after MT5 integration?  
  
P.P.S. Added some time later. What if these two profiles (as suggested at the picture) are fixed at the exact position and are still staying there while the chart is moving left, it might be an option?

I already migrated some parts of the system (e.g. HA-APB, TDZ and v2v MomenTicks...) but one step at a time only ; )─  
  
...a long way to go for MT5 based setup. But quite strange, based on my initial/personal observation, this system runs better under MT4.

I understand, there is the huge bunch of pieces of your work to transfer, that is why I am keeping silence.  
  
As of the point of fixation of MP, I meant that these right edges of these two profiles are fixed at the same appropriate point. The left edges can be still changed at their positions.

Thanks for this suggestion. I'll arrive on that eventually. I was thinking sort of exactly like that while I modified the execution process when vertical line guides are out of their respective position.  
  
I am getting lazier as a coder, as this system is getting bigger and bigger. Anyhow once done with another modification or updates, there are another 1,000 lines of codes left to do

Excerpts from a recent interview with the legendary trading psychology coach, Dr. Van K. Tharp.  
  
Dr. Tharp: "...that's why it's a100% Psychology. Also, many of the core religions of the world say that our everyday experiences are illusions, Buddhism and Hinduism called it Maya. And even Jesus through a course of miracles basically says that our thoughts are illusions ─that what we see means nothing except the meaningly given. In fact, a course of miracles can be summarized by nothing real can hurt you, nothing unreal exists, meaning it is all illusion. Here in life a piece of God."  
  
Dr. Tharp: ...And one of my favorite statements comes from Alfred Korzybski when he says... 'The map is not the territory'. Right now, I can totally explain why it's the case.  
  
Interviewer: "Wow! So you're saying that what we experienced is not real but just an illusion? And that the Market is basically... not real?"  
  
Dr. Tharp: "Exactly. And if you really understand that you'll become a trading genius"  
  
────────────────  
v2vboni: "This reminds me of the Matrix movie... A conversation between Neo and Morpheus.  
  
Neo: "I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life. I thought it wasn't real"  
  
Morpheus: "Your mind makes it real"  
  
Morpheus: "...if real is what you can feel, smell, taste and see, then 'real' is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain"  
────────────────  
  
Dr. Tharp: "Modern Science says... What's out there in the Universe is basically waves and particles. Waves are probability events for the particles. Hence, we are living in the world of vibrations. We have senses in the (human) body that can process the vibrations and translate them to something that we can understand"

**[v2v dynamic trading system](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=901713) _: ... a Project Looking Glass_**  
  
For some tools/indicators there so-called a re-paint one. However, others simply coded such a tool to process new information. Come to think of it, the candle bars are doing the same thing.   
  
It is natural for us humans to look for patterns after the fact, and then, we wait again to see if the stars are all aligned before pulling a trigger. Heck, we even see figures formed above our heads (cloud formation).  
  
Anyhow, if you are naive and gullible enough, you may find the following tool, just another re-paint job, LoL ; )─ ...and that's okay.  
  
  
Moving on, _Below is the updated tool:_  
  
**Short & Long Multiple Jurik & Deviation Scaled Filtered ─ T3-Hull MA**

  1. Added multiple options for process trigger

**_Updates..._**  
  
**Short & Long Multiple Jurik & Deviation Scaled Filtered ─ T3-Hull MA**

  1. Added multiple options for process trigger **(FIXED)**

    1. Now using a global variable to store the chosen execution trigger

      1. Button text is coded with the selected trigger (stored in a global variable):  
  
NB = New Bar Only  
NBT = New Bar and Timer  
NBV = New Bar and Volatility  
NBTV = New Bar, Timer and Volatility  
TV = Timer and Volatility  
TONLY = Timer Only

**_Updates..._**  
  
**Re**** _Flex_ **by John F. Ehlers **─** _Stocks & Commodities Magazine __February 2020 :_(more info >>> [attached PDF](https://www.forexfactory.com/attachment.php/3621557?attachmentid=3621557&d=1588257054))  
  
_"The reduction of lag is probably the most desirable characteristic of an indicator. That is because in trading, even if you get the right answer, it is of no value if the indication comes after the opportunity has passed. The new indicator I will present here is an averaging type of indicator. The averaging contributes to its stability, and the averaging is done in a novel way to produce zero lag. I named this new indicator “ reflex” because I used to be an archer, and the creation of the indicator reminded me of a bow and arrow. Reflex is a kind of bow with a cool name."_ _─ John F. Ehlers_  
  
**The background:**  
In “**Re**** _Flex_** : A New Zero-Lag Indicator” in this issue, author John Ehlers introduces a new averaging indicator that he has designed with reducing lag in mind. According to the author, this new indicator can be used to generate signals in a more timely manner than other lagging calculations. This is a continuation of his article and is the extended **Trend** _**Flex**_ indicator (that differs from the "reflex") indicator.  
  
It is a sort of momentum based indicator and should be used like that. The default setting is rather long - as usual, some experimenting with the parameters should be done before using it in trading decisions" _─Source: Based on the published MT5 initial TrendFlex coded version by mladen_

  1. **TDZ MomenTicks**

    1. **RSI & RSX based ****Re** _**Flex**_

Hi, v2vboni  
  
I have got an option into your wait list.  
  
At the picture you can see the ancor of the VWAP and the delimiter of a week.  
  
The idea is to automize the ancor switching into a new position each time a week ends.  
  
The new position of the ancor should become the monday open for the next week.  
  
For both of the momenticks' VWAPs such ancors should be switchable, say, one can set up at 8 weeks lag for the long-time ancor, the other ancor can be set up at 2 weeks lag for the short-time. That is why both ancors can be automatically replaced to new positions each time the week ends.  
  
Best  
D.P.

Hi, v2vbony  
  
I am using the system on Brent (Brn) Oil (the picture is attached). So, I seem to find some issues to check.  
1/ The neural net is magenta; it seems to be malfunctioning.  
2/ I have found that ATR parameters completely depend on Z-score now. So I have to set the parameters myself now. Where is the previous ATR mode?  
3/ I have no indicators in the bottom of a chart, if the new TPL is used. Is it right?  
4/ Can you give my exactly that set up (parameters) you use at the picture above (for SP500)?  
  
Be kind answering  
  
Best  
D.P.

Thanks for the feedback!

  1. Previously it was not mentioned that there was a hard-coded 2.58 (99%) z-score value in the calculation of Period for some tools within the system. Now, still using it but as a parameter value with a default value of 1.96 (95%) z-score, but with added dynamic calculation of ATR & Period values when DCP is ON: Period = DCP value with z-score and ATR value... While ATR1 & ATR2 is calculated dynamically with z-score and DCP value. if DCP is OFF: Period = 9 minimum either DCP is ON/OFF... While ATR1 = 9 & ATR2 = 27.  
  
The ATR1 & ATR2 is part of the calculation to get the final ATR value.  
  

  2. With Neural Network, thanks for reporting this issue. There's a bug in the calculation of Period dynamically with DCP ON or OFF. It got fixed and will be shared after this post.  
  

  3. The parameter used for SPX: VP-R = Monthly AR using M5 range TF with a multiplier of 12 (Anchored VP-R it is 9).

A suggestion to your issue list )  
  
1\. to add Z-score to the RSI legacy indicator  
2\. RA1/RA2/RA3/ and **OFF**  
  
Best  
D.P.  
  
1/ Neural net is stalled since yesterday. Please take a notice  
2/ VHF at RSI. What is it? Almost no reaction when pressed.

✔ Vertical Horizontal Filter (VHF)  
Vertical Horizontal Filter (VHF) was created by Adam White to identify trending and ranging markets. VHF measures the level of trend activity, similar to ADX in the Directional Movement System. Trend indicators can then be employed in trending markets and momentum indicators in ranging markets.

  1. The VHF feature of the TDZ works ONLY when MTF mode is OFF
  2. VHF description and other features are added again at post#1.
  3. TDZ or RSI based tools use the Z-score calculation.. but ONLY for the dynamic zone bands (top-mid-bottom). This is intentional to provide a sort of variance for the entire v2v dynamic trading system.
  4. Neural Network is intended to stall (applied just recently) and it can be run or re-run ONLY with its trigger button. _Why?_ Running it periodically (in a set amount of minutes) or every new bar would be heavy for the system to run and wait. The MT4 platform is still NOT supporting the multi-threading process. Thus, the tools are executed in FIFO. Personally, the stalled Neural Network output is much better as I can see what is shown to me after some time and compare to the current price movement since then <─ A sort of way to gauge the consistency of the Neural Network output.
  5. Regression Analysis... an OFF option can be added.

In my point of view... technically the current price level is sitting around weak highs and with enough room (average range) to move up before a retracement move.

On the chart below, I'm actually looking at the viability of retracement or reversal (higher or lower time frame) using the statistical quantiles as ADR midpoint. Such as P75 (midpoint of higher range) or P25 (midpoint of lower range)  
  
The example below is for P75 as ADR midpoint for range high.

You may check and see if the P25 midpoint viability for ADR range for USD/CAD, and with the same setup above.

**Updates:**

  1. v2v MomenTicks: The return of **Synthetic VIX Ratio**

    1. improved calculation

The Synthetic VIX indicator is based on Larry Williams' TASC article "Fix the VIX":  
  
When it comes to describing what markets do, Bernard Baruch said it best: "Markets fluctuate."  
  

  
Essentially, the VIX reflects investor fear — high readings are associated with high-volatility conditions (and market bottoms) while low readings are associated with low-volatility conditions (and market tops).  
  
Unfortunately, the VIX is calculated only for the S&P 500 Index, NASDAQ Composite Index, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. What about other markets?  
  
Luckily, it is easy to duplicate the VIX for any market — Treasury bonds, gold, silver, soybeans, even individual stocks — with a simple formula.

It seems to be due to price-gap handling ( adaptive algorithm might fix this one ─ which I will upload after this post-reply )  
...maybe due to inconsistencies with the data. You may need to download the tick-volume data for M1, M5, M15, and M30 TF )

Yes, you sort of sizing it to the corresponding volume profile structure. With regards to Pivot Fibs plus, at this point... nothing much I can do bout that. You can only adjust the session timeframe in 30-minute and in 1-hour based start time (or broker/server start time) based on the tool required parameter setup (NY, London, Tokyo... etc). It is the same for all PIVOT tools that I have seen so far.

If about the starting point of the VWAP & MVWAP, I based it on Dr. Paul Levine Lectures (R.I.P.) you need to have a starting point for the VWAP calculation (e.g. VWAP= (High+Low)/2 ...at the start of the day or plotted starting point, we need to put initial values ) <<< the resulting starting point, may be aligned with the vertical line guide or one tick/bar forward.

Much more interesting found

Another thought to have just enlighted me is to make the different Z-score settings for those two VP-R_Momentics VWAP profiles (as you made two buttons were for ATR and AR). The different ranges need the different Z-scores limitations!

The different ranges need the different Z-scores limitations! Best D.P. {image}

Thanks for the suggestion...  
  
I am getting there, but not quite due to time/focus constraints while trading/coding and a bunch of personal stuff to deal with.

**v2v**** _top correlation_**  
  
The correlation coefficient highlights the similarity of the movements between the two parties.

  1. If the correlation is high (above 80) and positive then the currencies move in the same way.
  2. If the correlation is high (above 80) and negative then the currencies move oppositely.
  3. If the correlation is low (below 60) then the currencies don't move in the same way.

─ A more improved run-time or on-load, timed-run and new bar execution handling  
─ Assigned clickable/trigger masked areas for switching input parameter  
─ Stand-alone version... but eventually, this tool will be fused with the v2v dynamic trading system

**v2v dynamic trading system:**  
  
Fixes the following tools:

  1. v2v MomenTicks ─ affected the MTF mode since the last update (fixed)
  2. v2v top correlation ─ fixed on-chart click anywhere and trigger the next TF sets instead of acting only upon clicking the assigned clickable area.

The v2v dynamic trading system is not the usual thing out there. It doesn't have any arrows or trigger alerts for a buy or sell signal. For such, it needs critical thinking of the One in between the keyboard and a chair. Yes, that is you.  
  
This system is designed for a discretionary type of trader. Thus, it may only help you to manage your trades or position your positions. And it requires the One's due diligence to understand or to know more about this system.

The v2v dynamic trading system is not the usual thing out there. It doesn't have any arrows or trigger alerts for a long/buy or short/sell signal. For such, it needs critical thinking of the One in between the keyboard and a chair. Yes, that is you.  
  
This system is designed for a discretionary type of trader. Thus, it may only help you to manage your trades or position your positions. And it requires the One's due diligence to understand or to know more about this system.

The v2v dynamic trading system is not the usual thing out there. It doesn't have any arrows or trigger alerts for a long/buy or short/sell signal. For such, it needs critical thinking of the One in between the keyboard and a chair. Yes, that is you.  
  
This system is designed for a discretionary type of trader. Thus, it may only help you to manage your trades or position your positions. And it requires the One's due diligence to understand or to know more about this system.

_**UPDATES:**_

  1. **v2v Power:**

    1. Just like the correlation tool, this one now uses the DCP value as an option. You can switch ON/OFF the DCP mode by clicking on the middle panel body and top header text.

  2. **v2v top correlations:**

    1. Updated header text... and applied some code optimizations.

  3. **New templates:**

    1. Updated default parameters

The Homodyne Discriminator Cycle Period measures the cycle period of the current market trend. It returns the current cycle period (in bars or candles) of the current market trend (or market cycle). Based on Homodyne Discriminator by John F. Ehlers, Rocket Science for Traders.  
  
This type of algorithm exhibits superior performance in a low signal-to-noise environment.  
  
Homodyne means I use the signal multiplied by itself one bar ago to produce a zero-frequency beat note. This beat note carries the phase angle of the one-bar change. Still using the basic definition of a cycle, the one-bar rate of change of phase is exactly the cycle period.  
  
And now... Here comes the v2v dynamic trading system armed by the DCP (Dominant Cycle Period) ─just replaced the word Discriminator (it seems inappropriate word in the new normal). The DCP tool shared the generated value (number of bars or candles) to the following tools below within the system.  
  
1 ) Regression Analysis: Linear, Quadratic, Logarithmic and Exponential  
2 ) Volume Profile with VWAP  
3 ) Traders Dynamic Zone  
4 ) v2v MomenTicks  
5 ) Neural Network  
6 ) v2v top correlations  
7 ) v2v Power

The v2v dynamic trading system is not the usual thing out there. It doesn't have any arrows or trigger alerts for a long/buy or short/sell signal. For such, it needs critical thinking of the One in between the keyboard and a chair. Yes, that is you.  
  
This system is designed for a discretionary type of trader. Thus, it may only help you to manage your trades or position your positions. And it requires the One's due diligence to understand or to know more about this system. Sadly, it may take some precious time to finish the user manual.

And begin to understand that these are all imaginary because of the Market (Makers) really can't kill you, but the Market seems to think that they can. However, once you took the red pill, you'll start to walk with the Architect while building a neural pathway to the art of trading (or science ─ whatever). Then arm yourself with this system plus a tried & tested trading plan (strategy/method), a sound position-sizing or money management, and a scam-free retail broker as you begin to see the Markets that nobody else does. ─ Agent v2v

✍ **Note:**  
─ The indicators or tools on this system is simply a visual representation of time and historical price. And just like the normal candle bars, it re-calculates based on new information.

Just banking on a probable rotation until an opportunity presents itself. This is a Monday intraday setup, which may(/not) continue through the early part of the Tuesday Asian session. But... for this setup, my enemy is the current trend (downtrend), Thus, I just keep my enemy closer ; )─ So no worries... keeping my losses small if ever, but eyeballing bigger winnings ; )─ ...I just wanted to ride the first train without Steven Seagal on it that may disrupt my trading plan ; )─

Did you notice that the **v2v****dynamic****trading system** is equipped with **VWAP****based**** _PIVOT FIBS_**?  
  
If I am not mistaken, this is the first of its kind. However, regardless of where the PIVOT is based on...  
You only need to see the confluence (more often) on an X _382_ and X _618 FIBS_

The v2v dynamic trading system is not the usual thing out there. It doesn't have any arrows or trigger alerts for a long/buy or short/sell signal. For such, it needs critical thinking of the One in between the keyboard and a chair. Yes, that is you.  
  
This system is designed for a discretionary type of trader. Thus, it may only help you to manage your trades or position your positions. And it requires the One's due diligence to understand or to know more about this system. Sadly, it may take some precious time to finish the user manual.

And begin to understand that these are all imaginary because the Market (Makers) really can't kill you, but the Market seems to think that they can. However, once you took the red pill, you'll start to walk with the Architect while building a neural pathway to the art of trading (or science ─ whatever). Then arm yourself with this system plus a tried & tested trading plan (strategy/method), a sound position-sizing or money management, and a scam-free retail broker as you begin to see the Markets that nobody else does. ─ Agent v2v

Thank you for your feedback!  
  
...still, a lot needs to be done.  
  
Pending updates:

  1. ASR (Average Session Range): On-going work (existing feature have issues)
  2. Dominant Cycle Period: to provide MTF capability to the tools within the system. Such as the v2v top correlation, v2v Power and TDZ & v2v Momenticks
  3. v2v Power:  
─ Will try to apply the previous bars lookup... just like the one with the Regression Analysis channel  
─ Will add the re-engineered DCP tool for MTF value (targetted TF for periods or bars)
  4. v2v top correlation:  
─ Will add the re-engineered DCP tool for MTF value (targetted TF for periods or bars)

The v2v dynamic trading system is not the usual thing out there. It doesn't have any arrows or trigger alerts for a long/buy or short/sell signal. For such, it needs critical thinking of the One in between the keyboard and a chair. Yes, that is you.  
  
This system is designed for a discretionary type of trader. Thus, it may only help you to manage your trades or position your positions. And it requires the One's due diligence to understand or to know more about this system. Sadly, it may take some precious time to finish the user manual.

And begin to understand that these are all imaginary because the Market (Makers) really can't kill you, but the Market seems to think that they can. However, once you took the red pill, you'll start to walk with the Architect while building a neural pathway to the art of trading (or science ─ whatever). Then arm yourself with this system plus a tried & tested trading plan (strategy/method), a sound position-sizing or money management, and a scam-free retail broker as you begin to see the Markets that nobody else does. ─ Agent v2v

The VWAP bands on this system...  
  
This one is built with an ATR or Average Range /or ADR wherein the Shifted VWAP bands (from the midpoint - main VWAP) are calculated based on statistical z-scores. The main VWAP (the middle line) starting point of calculation is based on Dr. Paul Levine's (R.I.P.) lectures about his system called MIDAS. However, the so-called Top-Bottom Finder I did not fuse it, but instead, I'm using the z-score for the probability of predicting a trend end via ATR or AR-based calculation. The vertical line guides on this system (from & to) are used for plotting from price inflection points or session range (4-hour, daily, weekly, and monthly or 8-hour or 24-hour market range). The setup included an M-VWAP (MA-based VWAP ─ switch instantly with Classic VWAP). The MA is a Hull MA non-lag fused using a Fulks Matulich calculation way of a T3 based MA. As a result, I called it a T3-HMA.  
  
Mostly, the MAs inside the system are Linear-Volume-Weighted with Jurik-based MA smoothing filter (but some of it only as the rest are using an adaptive calculation with Price) before adding DSMA filter (deviation-scaled MA calculation by John F. Ehlers). Then, the other tools are integrated with the system. Such as, Regression Analysis that can switch instantly with the Classic - a normal Price Close, and a Heiken Ashi based APB Close Price calculation). And most of the MA period is dynamically calculated/assigned based on the Dominant Cycle Period algorithm by John F. Ehlers.

**UPDATES:**  
  
_1 ) A unique strength indicator called a**v2v Power** is fueled by Dominant Cycle Period (DCP) to generate the number of bars (or Period) and calculate the number of power hours to use for gauging the strength of an instrument or symbol._

  1. _And just like the regression analysis tool, I integrated the vertical line guides (via VP-R tool) that are used for anchoring a starting point or to limit/increase the number of bars to calculate. Such as... start position from session opening, price bar inflection points, and beginning of a trend. Thus, it can be used for plotting manually as a user-defined starting point._

_2 ) New templates_

1 ) **v2v Power**... **Special edition:**_**Time Travel**_  
A one of a kind currency/instrument strength tool that comes with great responsibility ; )─  
  
─ Applied mechanics and invention of _Dr. Emmett Lathrop "Doc" Brown, Ph.D._  
─ And fused a 1981 DeLorean sports car driven by _Michael J. Fox._  
─ Now, a tool that can go back in time, and powered by a techno-babble called the _Flux Capacitor_  
─ A tool designed knowing that _inter-market relationships govern currency price action._  
  
2 ) Regression Analysis: On-swap start/endpoint correction (**fixed an issue caused by the above updates**)  
  
3 ) v2v & TDZ MomenTicks: data source adjusted to M5 data (if current TF > M1)

The v2v dynamic trading system is not the usual thing out there. It doesn't have any arrows or trigger alerts for a long/buy or short/sell signal. For such, it needs critical thinking of the One in between the keyboard and a chair. Yes, that is you.  
  
This is a discretionary trader designed system or someone with a systematic trading plan/strategy. Thus, it may only help you to manage your trades or position your positions. And it requires the One's due diligence to understand or to know more about this system. Sadly, it may take some precious time to finish the user manual due to constant development/updates.

The system requires **One** 's due diligence to understand or to know more about this system. Sadly, it may take some precious time to finish the user manual due to constant development/updates.  
  
**UPDATES:****_The following tools have been optimized._**

  2. TDZ & v2v MomenTicks: Range calculation ─ both ATR & ADR mode

  4. Heiken Ashi APB ─ Fixed a function: MT4 server or Internet disconnection handling

  1. Default parameter values
  2. New templates

**McGinley****Dynamic** fused with**TDZ Momen _Ticks_**  
  
The **McGinley Dynamic** indicator is a kind of moving average that was designed in order to track the market in a better way in comparison to the current moving average indicators. It is a technical indicator that enhances the movement of average lines by adjusting for shifts within the market speed.  
  
This technical analysis tool was designed to solve the main issue with moving averages, their reliance on fixed time periods. It helps solve the issue of varying market speeds and provides a more accurate reflection of price action.  
  
The McGinley Dynamic indicator was **invented by John R. McGinley** , a former editor of the Market Technicians Association’s Journal of Technical Analysis and a Certified Market Technician.  
  
The indicator itself is relatively new. It came from McGinley’s efforts in the 1990s to design a responsive indicator capable of adjusting itself to the market’s speed. Hence, the name** “dynamic.”** The McGinley Dynamic indicator was first published in the Journal of Technical Analysis in 1997.  
  
Many traders, analysts, and market experts refer to the McGinley Dynamic indicator as **“the most reliable indicator, you have never heard of.”**  
Similar to MAs and other indicators, the McGinley Dynamic isn’t intended to be used on its own. It is advisable for the best results to complement it with other indicators  
  
Now, integrated **as an oscillato** r under **_v2v dynamic trading systems'_**_architecture_

  1. Classic (RSI) McGinley Dynamic Zone
  2. Trend Strength Zone (RSX) McGinley Dynamic

Thanks... I am much better now.  
  
  
I had a severe COVID case  
─ unusual fatigue  
─ sore throat  
─ body aches: bones (bone marrow) at lower limbs feeling like having a migraine  
─ sense of smell gone for almost 3 days  
─ severe cough with intermittent vomiting  
─ fever 37 - 39 °C  
─ eventually, suffered an ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) caused by COVID or the so-called COVID pneumonia  
  
I'm not able to trade and code for 3+ weeks. But just okay.

**v2v****dynamic****trading system****─ ****_for_ MT4 platform**  
  
_**Project Looking Glass...**_ Reimagination of a trading system under the retail trading environment built with Tesla footprints inside. And dynamically driven by the current Dominant Cycle Period (DCP) with price calculation fueled by **Momen**** _Ticks_**** _─_** linear volume-weighted momentum.  
  
The v2v dynamic trading system is not the usual thing out there. It doesn't have any arrows or trigger alerts for a long/buy or short/sell signal. For such, it needs critical thinking of the **One** in between the keyboard and a chair. Yes, that is you.  
  
The system requires **One** 's due diligence to understand or to know more about this system. Sadly, it may take some precious time to finish the user manual due to constant development/updates.

And begin to understand that these are all imaginary because the Market (Makers) really can't kill you, but the Market seems to think that they can. However, once you took the red pill, you'll start to walk with the Architect while building a neural pathway to the art of trading (or science ─ whatever). Then arm yourself with this system plus a tried & tested trading plan (strategy/method), a sound position-sizing or money management, and a scam-free retail broker as you begin to see the Markets that nobody else does. ─ Agent v2v

Featuring RMA Phase Accumulation MACD  
─ This is a variation of [RMA MACD](https://www.mql5.com/en/code/26749) (for MT5) by mladen, and I fused inside v2v MomenTicks  
  
  
This MACD is using what is known as the RMA average for MACD calculation.  
  
Taking into consideration that RMA is a variation of the SMA, the MACD values produced are almost surprisingly "fast" compared to the regular ema version. It also has some interesting properties when it comes to periods following the very volatile periods. In any case, seems to be a useful tool in the family of all sorts of MACD variations.

**UPDATES:**

  1. Re-introducing the PolyChromatic Momentum feature for **TDZ _MomenTicks_**  
  
_Denis Meyers that invented Polychromatic Momentum, describes it as:_  
Momentum is defined as the difference, or percent change, between the current bar and a bar some lookback period in the past. The major problem with using momentum-based indicators is that the optimum lookback period seems to change over time creating losses with the current chosen lookback period _(this release is using a period generated via DCP calculation)._  
  
To avoid the errors due to a single lookback period we create an indicator that takes a weighted average of all significant lookback periods for the tradable. We named this indicator **polychromatic** because poly means many and chromatic means colors. Thus, the Polychromatic for this indicator translates into the sum of many Momentums... But this release is using all the filters & features under the umbrella of _v2v**MomenTicks system architecture**_.  
  

  2. Minor updates on the following tools...  
─ HA-APB  
─ v2v MomenTicks  
─ Volumes On Main Chart  
─ News Events  
  

  3. New templates

**Re**** _Flex_** by John F. Ehlers **─** _Stocks & Commodities Magazine February 2020_  

> Quote
> 
> Disliked
> 
> The reduction of lag is probably the most desirable characteristic of an indicator. That is because in trading, even if you get the right answer, it is of no value if the indication comes after the opportunity has passed. The new indicator I will present here is an averaging type of indicator. The averaging contributes to its stability, and the averaging is done in a novel way to produce zero lag. I named this new indicator “reflex” because I used to be an archer, and the creation of the indicator reminded me of a bow and arrow. Reflex is a kind of bow with a cool name. ─ John F. Ehlers

  
**The background:**  
  
**Re**** _Flex_** : A New Zero-Lag Indicator” ─ author John Ehlers introduces a new averaging indicator that he has designed with reducing lag in mind.  
  
**_Now... Reintroducing this feature under the v2v dynamic trading system's architecture:_**

  1. **TDZ MomenTicks**  
─ added RSI & RSX based **Re**** _Flex_**  
  

  2. **New templates & default parameter values**

**v2v dynamic trading system** ─ _for MT4 platform_  
  
A **Re**** _Flex_**(under TDZ MomenTicks) companion emerges... called **Trend**** _Flex_** : A John Ehlers' algorithm that got fused with v2v dynamic trading system's architecture.  
  
─ RMA phase accumulation **Trend**** _Flex_**(under v2v MomenTicks)  
─ This **Trend**** _Flex_** is using what is known as the RMA average for trend calculation. Just like the RMA phase MACD. The values produced are almost surprisingly "fast" compared to the regular version.  
  
The **Re**** _Flex_** indicator synchronizes with the cycle component in the price data. The second, its “companion”, the **Trend**** _Flex_** retains the trend component.

**UPDATES:**  
  
TDZ MomenTicks  
─ RSI & RSX Heiken Ashi Delta  
haDelta is a simple formula originally developed and published by Mr. Dan Valcu. The idea behind haDelta is to quantify HA candles. By doing this, one can measure momentum and this is very important when you use haDelta for reversals. It measures the difference between HA Close and HA Open. Caution: High sensitivity if used.  
─ Removed McGinley dynamic  
  
  
v2v MomenTicks  
─ Adjusted dynamic period calculation

==============================================  
**A must before loading the v2v dynamic trading system ( new steps )**  
==============================================  
**Follow the steps below:**

  1. Open an M1 chart
  2. Press the "F2" key to load History Center
  3. Navigate to the currency pair and the "1 Minute (M1)" history data for the chart you have open in your terminal (be sure to "double click" the "1 Minute (M1)" selection in the history center so it becomes the active selection)
  4. Then left-click once on any of the data rows in the right-hand window of the History Center (it doesn't matter which one)
  5. Click the "_Add_ " button, this pops up another window titled "Bar" and the default selection is on the "year"
  6. Enter 1970
  7. Then select "_OK_ "... and it creates a new bar with the timestamp and price info you just added.
  8. Now select "_Close_ " in the History Center
  9. Attached a script located under "Scripts" folder (with _v2v_dynamic_system.zip_) >>> Attached this to your chart: _ForceLoadHistoricalData.ex4_
  10. Navigate to your M1 chart of interest and then from the terminal window (press _Ctrl-T_) select "_Journal_ "-> go to main chart window and _right-click mouse button_ and select "_Refresh_ "...this will refresh the chart and attempts to fill any time gaps in the chart data (which now includes your year 1970 data point) with server data  
Step 10 continued...Now your chart will have pulled anywhere from 2048 to 65536 M1 bars from your broker's server (not Metaquotes server) and is usually far more data than you can get the broker to cough up when you try and manually scroll your M1 chart back in time.

The **v2v dynamic trading system** uses global variables extensively. Below are the maintenance steps that you may follow:  
  
MT4 global variable maintenance:

  1. Press "F3" on your keyboard to delete all or selectively (press Ctrl-A on your keyboard) the global variable(s)
  2. Or take a look at the image below which shows the built-in on-chart global variable maintenance trigger.

**v2v****dynamic****trading system****─ ****_for_ MT4 platform**  
  
This system acts as a trading platform within MetaTrader.  
  
_**Project Looking Glass...**_ Reimagination of a trading system under the retail trading environment built with Tesla footprints inside. And dynamically driven by the current Dominant Cycle Period (DCP) with price calculation fueled by **Momen**** _Ticks_**** _─_** linear volume-weighted momentum.  
  
The v2v dynamic trading system is not the usual thing out there. It doesn't have any directional arrows and trigger alerts for long/buy or short/sell signals. For such, it needs critical thinking of the **One** in between the keyboard and a chair.   
  
The system requires **One** 's due diligence to understand or to know more about this system. Sadly, it may take some precious time to finish the user manual due to constant development/updates.

However, once you took the red pill, you'll start to walk with the Architect while building a neural pathway to the art of trading (or science ─ whatever). Then arm yourself with this system plus a tried & tested trading plan (strategy/method), a sound position-sizing or money management, and a scam-free retail broker as you begin to see the Markets that nobody else does. ─ Agent v2v

Again, I just wanted to add or reiterate (without sounding rude), that this v2v dynamic trading system is not for noobs, and I won't say that this system or indicators are for noobs as it would tend to sound not a good trading tool to have ; )─ I just meant that it requires greater experience to understand how the system works. Otherwise, look for another trading system that makes you think less and adhere to the mantra of the KISS approach.  
  
If you somehow can't figure out how to set it up on the MT4 platform... Then, it means you're probably not yet skillful enough to use this system as this requires due diligence/resourcefulness or does not have enough experience with third-party tools/indicators. Even more, in terms of trading experience to understand (how to's) the system or to know if one needs to ditch it or not. More so, It is a FREE system. What more effort needs to be given to the users? No one fed the coder with a silver spoon while coding this system. ; )─  
  
This development thread journal contains a few pages of information to learn more than enough to use the system. Although, personally... My system and the trading itself need almost superhuman amounts of patience, composure, resolve, self-discipline, resilience, or necessitates... Even some counter-intuitive decision-making before/after clicking that buy or sell button.  
  
This trading system makes you a responsible trader that uses more of your brainpower and not just simply waiting for a buy & sell signal or a pattern to form. This system will let you create your combination of confluences/setups and produced your own technical baseline bias before any type of price action shows up on your chart. However, at the end of the day, it is you and you alone who can figure out what works and what doesn’t. Good luck!  
  
**UPDATES:**  
1) An improved band multiplier (z-score and Fibonacci) application process,  and with that...  
2) Additional control buttons got added for the following tools: TDZ MomenTicks, Regression Analysis, and Volume Profile - Range.  
3) Now, the data source (tick/volume) got fixed to use only M1 data which in turn fixed the data horizon detection.  
3) Implemented a v2v Power panel display limitation: By default, it will show only from M5 to H1 TF ─ via parameter modification.  
4) New templates with updated default parameters

The **v2v dynamic trading system** uses global variables extensively. Below are the maintenance steps that you may follow:  
  
MT4 global variable maintenance:

  1. Press "F3" on your keyboard to delete all or selectively (press Ctrl-A on your keyboard) the global variable(s)
  2. Or take a look at the image below which shows the built-in on-chart global variable maintenance trigger.

I'm thinking of adding the classic standard deviation bands as an option. This is like the classic market/volume profile tools out there.  
  
Currently, the bands you're seeing as described on the first post (post #1) herein are based on Average Range (ATR or Average (N) Daily, Weekly, and Monthly Range. This is for the band size width while using the statistical Z-score or Fibonacci-based calculation with MVWAP or classic VWAP value as its starting point for band expansion (+/-)

**Dynamic MyRSI with NET (Noise Elimination Technology)**  
  
Inside the December of 2020 issue of TASC Magazine, John Ehlers published an indicator called MyRSI with NET (Noise Elimination Technology) in which he uses a sort of Kendall (auto)correlation to filter out signals. This release contains the initial works posted by mladen (4th November 2021) @ MetaQuotes domain codebase or >>> [here](https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/post/13770622#post13770622).  
  
**MyRSI**  
Is an RSI alike version of the well-known RSI indicator where the output is range-bound between -1 and 1 values. The indicator accrues Closes up and Closes down and plots their ratio divided by their sum.  
  
**Noise Elimination Technique**  
As a noise elimination technique, we are using a slightly modified and simplified version of Kendall Correlation that allows us to use it on a single indicator. In general Kendall, Correlation is used to measure an association between two sets of variables.  
  
  
And with this release, I added the following features and functions under the v2v dynamic trading system architecture:  
  
─ Dynamically generated number of Periods using the DCP (Dominant Cycle Period) tool. Hence, it works ONLY with the v2v dynamic trading system.  
─ This is using HA-APB based desired Price calculation (e.g. HA-APB Close, HA-APB Open, HA-APB Typical, HA-APB Weighted... etc.)  
─ Applied Tech: ATR price adaptive, DSMA, and MomenTicks  
─ Dz (Dynamic zone) Bands using ATR based calculation  
─ Added the classic and hidden Divergence (as dots). Plus... An option to choose NET (as default) or MyRSI based Div.

Dynamic MyRSI with NET ( Noise Elimination Technology)  
  
─ Fixed issues with both releases: Stand-alone release and the one fused with _v2v dynamic trading system_  
─ Disable access parameter buttons when loading: Applied on both releases.  
─ Added disconnection handler with the stand-alone release  
─ Updated templates

─ The differences between the stand-alone (well, sort of) and the v2v trading system release are the followings...  
(1) This one doesn't have a detection feature for the sudden surge of volatility (...replaced with work speed in minutes - parameter adjustment), and  
(2) the work data source doesn't use the data horizon feature (quality tick/volume data usage) whenever it moves from TF to TF. Instead, it uses the current TF only  
(3) With this stand-alone release, it has its own ON/OFF control via global variables.  
(4) Plus, a reactive behavior whenever the MT4 disconnected due to internet or broker server issues.

**v2v dynamic trading system**  
  
Now... The dawn of the new era has begun. The Dynamic MyRSI with NET (Noise Elimination Technology) officially took the sub-window that was previously occupied by the TDZ MomenTicks under the umbrella of the v2v system.  
  
Thank you for your service TDZ!

**v2v dynamic trading system ─ for MT4 platform**  
  
_A project-looking glass by v2v..._  
  
A trading system reimagined for the retail trading environment built with Tesla footprints and dynamically driven by Dominant Cycle Period (DCP) fueled by MomenTicks ─ A linear volume-weighted momentum.  
  
The v2v dynamic trading system is not the usual thing out there. It doesn't have any directional arrows and trigger alerts for long/buy or short/sell signals. For such, it needs critical thinking of the One in between the keyboard and a chair. Yes, that is you.  
  
The system requires One's due diligence to understand or to know more about this system. Sadly, it may take some precious time to finish the user manual due to constant development/updates.

And begin to understand that these are all imaginary because the Market (Makers) really can't kill you, but the Market seems to think that they can. However, once you took the red pill, you'll start to walk with the Architect while building a neural pathway to the art of trading (or science ─ whatever). Then arm yourself with this system plus a tried & tested trading plan (strategy/method), a sound position-sizing or money management, and a scam-free retail...

  
Having said that, don't forget to...

This is a discretionary trader-designed system or for someOne with a systematic trading plan/strategy. Thus, it may help to manage trades or position existing positions... Otherwise, come up with an overall/average directional probability.

Well, the above statement is just an example of a predatory statement or a typical marketing scheme on how to dupe noobs and/or gullible traders out there. I just put those words herein only as a tool to spark interest in the shared resources below. Also, I was thinking that these may help to decide whether to add or use this ambitious trading system as part of your trading arsenal.

**v2v dynamic trading system _─ for MT4 platform_**  
  
_A project-looking glass by v2v..._  
  
A trading system reimagined for the retail trading environment built with Tesla footprints and dynamically driven by Dominant Cycle Period (DCP) fueled by MomenTicks ─ A linear volume-weighted momentum.  
  
The v2v dynamic trading system is not the usual thing out there. It doesn't have any directional arrows and trigger alerts for long/buy or short/sell signals. For such, it needs critical thinking of the One in between the keyboard and a chair. Yes, that is you.  
  
The system requires One's due diligence to understand or to know more about this system. Sadly, it may take some precious time to finish the user manual due to constant development/updates.

> Now sit back, relax, and start to believe that we're on the Matrix, just like Neo. And begin to understand that these are all imaginary because the Market (Makers) really can't kill you, but the Market seems to think that they can. However, once you took the red pill, you'll start to walk with the Architect while building a neural pathway to the art of trading (or science ─ whatever). Then arm yourself with this system plus a tried & tested trading plan (strategy/method), a sound position-sizing or money management, and a scam-free retail...

  
Having said that, don't forget to...

> Trust in the Lord with all of your heart and lean not on your understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.  
>  ─ Proverbs 3:5-6 NIV

  
This is a discretionary trader-designed system or for someOne with a systematic trading plan/strategy. Thus, it may help to manage trades or position existing positions... Otherwise, come up with an overall/average directional probability.  
  
✍ A gentle reminder...  
  
─ Keep this in mind... There's always room for improvement in this system.  
─ Ideas/suggestions are welcome but don't expect to be added or considered.  
  
But before anything else... Kindly note, that you may start to feel that you've entered the Matrix while reading the below information for you to identify what is real and what is not. However, this all depends on what pill you took from Morpheus ; )─ Otherwise, you might start to feel resurrected. And don't worry, you should be just fine.  
  
Other times, you might suddenly see a Black Cat just walk by, and then followed by another that behaves the same way. And then, you ask yourself... Is it a _Deja vu?_ Again, don't worry... It simply means that I'm currently altering the codes of the v2v dynamic trading system ; )─

**C)**_Before loading the v2v dynamic trading system, please read the following steps below. And make sure to do the same steps with all the currency pairs or instruments to load enough tick/volume history._  
  
_1 ─ Open an M1 chart_  
_2 ─ Press the "F2" key to load History Center_  
_3 ─ Navigate to the currency pair and the "1 Minute (M1)" history data for the chart you have open in your terminal (be sure to "double click" the "1 Minute (M1)" selection in the history center so it becomes the active selection)_  
_then left-click once on any of the data rows in the right-hand window of the History Center (it doesn't matter which one)_  
_4 ─ Click the "Add" button, this pops up another window titled "Bar" and the default selection is on the "year"_  
_5 ─ Enter 1970_  
_6 ─ Then select "OK"... and it creates a new bar with the timestamp and price info you just added._  
_7 ─ Now select "Close" in the History Center_  
_8 ─ Attached a script located under "Scripts" folder (with v2v_dynamic_system.zip) >>> Attached this to your chart: ForceLoadHistoricalData.ex4_  
_9 ─ Navigate to your M1 chart of interest and then from the terminal window (press Ctrl-T) select "Journal "- > go to main chart window and right-click mouse button and select "Refresh"...this will refresh the chart and attempts to fill any time gaps in the chart data (which now includes your year 1970 data point) with server data_  
_10 ─ continued... Now your chart will have pulled anywhere from 2048 to 65536 M1 bars from your broker's server (not Metaquotes server) and is usually far more data than you can get the broker to cough up when you try and manually scroll your M1 chart back in time._

**E)** Make sure to load the attached template. There's an order of loading the tools within this system as one tool depends on another. Meaning, you cannot simply attach one-by-one or use one or two tools only.  
  
**F)** From time to time you may need to click this reset button...

**Note:**  
Most of the users who consistently use the v2v system are usually loading this from another computer or another instance of the MT4 platform to generate their own technical bias.  
  
Another thing to note is that... From the backend side of your Broker's MT4 server, they can set a bandwidth limit for each instrument or currency pair (even less on the MT4 demo server).  
Hence, those major pairs, crosses, or instruments load faster compared to others. And since this _v2v dynamic trading system_ processes tick/data intensively, it may add additional load. Even more so, as most of the tools within the v2v system are doing recursive calculation (at least three cycles and the others are six)

_**SmoothStep function fused inside the dynamic MyRSI - NET**_  
  
Returns a value from 0 to 1 that represents a parameter's proportional distance between a minimum and maximum value. The SmoothStep function lets you increase an attribute such as Opacity from 0 to 1 gradually, but nonlinearly, over a time range.  
  
Some more information on SmoothStep is available here >>> [SmoothStep - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothstep)  
  
  
An initial experiment (mql coded) was shared here >>> _[https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...0#post13979010](https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/post/13979010#post13979010)_

✜ v2v dynamic trading system ✜  
  
**☛ dynamic My NET (Noise Elimination Technology)**_with**SmoothStep function**_... just got **ELEGANT!**  
  
In a unique update for dynamic MyNET with SmoopthStep function, "An Elegant Oscillator: Inverse Fisher Transform Redux," author John Ehlers (At TASC Magazine article - February 2022) explains how he uses the inverse Fisher transform to create an indicator he calls the elegant oscillator.  
  
First, he describes the Fisher transform before explaining the inverse Fisher transform, which provides normalization by dividing the root mean square (RMS) value into the waveform.  
  
The elegant oscillator can spot reversion-to-the-mean opportunities with improved timing capabilities.  
  
Note: The initial release by mladen can be found >>> [here](https://www.mql5.com/en/code/37881)

The ala Philadelphia Experiment... updates for the _**v2v dynamic trading system**_  
  
UPDATES: A fusion with _dynamic MyNET_  
─ ADXm Regular & Double: Rebirth out of wedlock ; )─  
─ Elegant Oscillator: Reborn out of boredom ; )─  
  
─ New templates and default parameters  
  
ADX is a very popular indicator and its elaborated form is the Average Directional Movement. The traders rely on this indicator to assess the strength of the trend. But using the traditional ADX requires a perfect understanding of the highs and lows of the market. To make things easier, the developers have created ADXm Indicator  
  
Now, here comes the **ADXm** fusion with _dynamic MyNET with SmoothStep function._

[TASC's January 2022 edition](https://traders.com/Documentation/FEEDbk_docs/2022/01/TradersTips.html) Traders' Tips includes the "**(Yet Another Improved) RSI Enhanced With Hann Windowing** " article authored by John Ehlers. Once again John Ehlers revolutionizes the RSI indicator.  
  
By employing a Hann windowed finite impulse response filter (FIR), John Ehlers has enhanced the "Relative Strength Indicator" (RSI) to provide an improved oscillator with exceptional smoothness.  
  
The method of calculations using "closes up" and "closes down" from Welles Wilder's RSI described in his 1978 book is still inherent to Ehlers enhanced formula. However, a finite impulse response (FIR) Hann windowing technique is employed following the closes up/down calculations instead of the original Wilder infinite impulse response averaging filter. The resulting oscillator waveform is confined between +/-1.0 with a 0.0 centerline regardless of chart interval, as opposed to Wilder's original formulation, which was confined between 0 and 100 with a centerline of 50. On any given trading timeframe, the value of Ehlers' enhanced RSI found above the centerline typically represents an overvalued region, while undervalued regions are typically found below the centerline.  
  
In this update to the v2v dynamic trading system is a fusion between _**RSI with Hann windowing (RSI H)**_ **and** _**dynamic MyNET**_. In such a fusion between the two, _RSI H_ is reborn with inherent features/functions shared within the _v2v dynamic trading system architecture._

[TASC's December 2021 edition](https://traders.com/Documentation/FEEDbk_docs/2022/01/TradersTips.html) Traders' Tips includes the "**The DMH: Directional Movement indicator****with****Hann windowing** " article authored by John Ehlers. This study offers an improvement over the classic directional movement indicator developed by J. Welles Wilder by applying a finite impulse response (FIR) filter using Hann window coefficients.  
  
The calculation starts with the classic definition of PlusDM and MinusDM. These directional movements are summed in an exponential moving average (EMA). Then, this EMA is further smoothed in FIR filter using Hann window coefficients over the calculation period.  
  
In this update to the _v2v dynamic trading system_ is a fusion between _**DMH**_ **and** _**dynamic MyNET**_. In this fusion between the two, it inherits the features/functions shared within the _v2v dynamic trading system architecture._

v2v dynamic trading system...  
  
Fixed and optimized the VP-R tools for handling MT4/Platform (broker server/user's internet) disconnection that resets the vertical line guides to default position on charts. The VP-R vertical line guides should remain in-place after successful reconnection to the MT4 server.

**UPDATES:**

  1. In this release, I have made some minor changes to the way the data sources are handled within the system.

  1. New templates: Once loaded, check/verify the indicator parameter if you prefer a recursive calculation is ON or OFF

**dynamic MyNET:** _Added Non-Linear Regression-adjusted QQE double_  
  
TASC magazine August 2022 issue, featured another variant of a moving average called “The Linear Regression-Adjusted Exponential Moving Average." Author Vitali Apirine presents a technique called the linear regression-adjusted exponential moving average (LRAdj EMA) to combine a linear regression indicator with an EMA. The indicator can be used to help define turning points while filtering price movement. The LRAdj EMA can be applied in combination with a traditional exponential moving average of the same length to facilitate trend identification.  
  
By contrast, under the v2v dynamic trading system architecture or inside the dynamic MyNET tool...  
  
The algorithm was applied to **Non-Linear Regression-adjusted Quantitative Qualitative Estimation (QQE) double (NLR-adj QQE double).** It then inherits all technologies used by the v2v dynamic trading system.  
  
As a form of regression analysis, nonlinear regression involves fitting data to models and expressing the results mathematically. Compared to simple linear regression, which generates a straight line between two variables (X and Y) as if Y was a random variable, nonlinear regression must generate a curve (typically). This model aims to minimize (as small as possible) the sum of squares.  
  
An observation's sum of squares measures how far it varies from the data set's mean. It is computed by first finding the difference between the mean and every data point in the set. Then, each of those differences is then squared. Lastly, all of the squared figures are added together. The smaller the sum of these squared figures, the better the function fits the data points in the set. Nonlinear regression uses logarithmic functions, trigonometric functions, exponential functions, and other fitting methods.  
  
To summarize the Difference between Linear and Nonlinear Regression Models...

> The difference between linear and nonlinear regression models isn’t as straightforward as it sounds. You’d think that linear equations produce straight lines and nonlinear equations model curvature. Unfortunately, that’s not correct. Both types of models can fit curves to your data—so that’s not the defining characteristic. To know more on how to identify linear and nonlinear regression models >>> click [HERE](https://statisticsbyjim.com/regression/difference-between-linear-nonlinear-regression-models/). The difference between nonlinear and linear is the “non.” OK, that sounds like a joke, but, honestly, that’s the easiest way to understand the difference.

**Momentum Deviation**  
  
Based on work published by mladen @ mql library - 12th December 2021  
  
However, this is another variation of a standard deviation as it got embedded with _**dynamic MyNET**_  
\- it uses the momentum of price (instead of price itself) for calculation  
\- it is calculated in a way that it takes minimal CPU load  
\- As far as values are concerned, it is similar to standard deviation. Same as standard deviation -it can calculate the deviation of anything.

**Nadaraya - Watson Estimator** fused with _**dynamic MyNET**_  
  
A kernel as a weighting function was used by Nadaraya and Watson in 1964 to estimate values as a locally weighted average. This produces a smoothed (non-causal) value that can be used to estimate future values. Mladen published the MQL version at [MQL source library](https://www.mql5.com/en/code/36883), basing it off of an indicator developed by luxAlgo for different trading platforms.  
  
**Recommendations...**

  1. Use it for discretionary estimates only,
  2. never use it in any signaling mode.
  3. But again, it is _"discretionary"_... In another context, you can only blame yourself, and not the creator. ; )=

**dynamic Nadaraya - Watson Estimator** with _**NET (Noise Elimination Technology)**_  
  
A kernel as a weighting function was used by Nadaraya and Watson in 1964 to estimate values as a locally weighted average. This produces a smoothed (non-causal) value that can be used to estimate future values.   
  
Estimating a future state given a selective past (lagged variables) is important but provides only a fragment of the information necessary in order to forecast. The predictive distribution on the other hand contains all information about this future state given the selective past.  
  
**Recommendations...**

  1. Use it for discretionary estimates only,
  2. never use (but you may) it in any signaling mode.
  3. But again, it is _"discretionary"_... In another context, you can only blame yourself, and not the creator. ; )=

It appears that the Nadaraya - Watson Estimator hype is real. However, this is only one trade ; )-  
  
We'll have to wait and see how it turns out in the long run. Meanwhile, let's see if I can make the Nadaraya - Watson envelope within v2v dynamic trading system main chart... or probably not ; )=

It will be interesting to see if Frankfurt FX fixing pushes up the price even more @ current price or returns to current week VWAP area. --- @ post time: 1.05974

EUR/USD... continuous testing with dz NWE with NET  
  
Updated positions: New TP @ 1.05940... a little above the Weekly VWAP (NY Day session)  
I believe this price area will become resistance if it drops below or on the NY Weekly VWAP. Then, once my target is reached... My plan is to buy dips before/on/during the NY session.

Due to a pinch of greed, I spent a few chart hours before I closed my trade (at 1.05820)... Even so, I'm still making much better profits since I added more entries.  
Let's move on... If an opportunity arises, I'll sell high.  
  
I have only traded a few times so far... I think Nadaraya-Watson Estimator is pretty good.

EUR/USD:  
  
But @ post time... The narratives... Is to break 1.06350 for Buyers to Price hike... Then, breaking 1.05810 for Sellers to Price drop.  
Otherwise... Price needs to surpass the running 3-Week VWAP line above... and the running VWAP since the last significant price move down and up to the current pull back.

The lesson... Don't underestimate the price movement a day or few hours before the NFP day ; )=  
  
Although I was shown the optimal directional probability by my technical system... I let my contrarian tendencies get the better of me ; )---  
  
♬ Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew  
When I bit off more than I could chew  
But through it all, when there was doubt  
I ate it up and spit it out  
I faced it all and I stood tall and did it my way♬  
  
Again, I was reminded of what I wrote on the first page.  
  
**Note to Self:** “ _While no methodology or system that works in every instance . . . I have never seen anything so consistent_ ” ─ just like this system ; )─  
  
Test continues with Nadaraya-Watson Estimator in the next trading week.

**v2v dynamic trading system**  
  
UPDATES: _**dynamic MyNET**_

  1. Removed RSI-Trend Strength Index (RSX)
  2. Add McGinley Dynamic using RSX as smoothing function:  
If VHF is ON = The "improved" formula will be activated (based on mladen's work published @ [MQL library](https://www.mql5.com/en/code/31753))

  
The **McGinley Dynamic** is a type of moving average that was designed to track the market better than existing moving average indicators. It is a technical indicator that improves upon moving average lines by adjusting for shifts in market speed. John R. McGinley, a market technician, is the inventor of the eponymous indicator.  
  
_KEY TAKEAWAYS:_

  1. The McGinley Dynamic indicator is a type of moving average that was designed to track the market better than existing moving average indicators.
  2. This indicator solves the issue of varying market speeds by incorporating an automatic adjustment factor into its formula, which speeds (or slows) the indicator in trending, or ranging, markets.
  3. The McGinley Dynamic indicator improves upon conventional moving averages by minimizing price separations and volatile whipsaws so that price action is more accurately reflected.

This coming trading week, I'll be conservative in terms of my position size... In other words, securing a fortress of safety or taking a defensive stance.  
  
EUR/USD: H4 TF ...as much as possible use M1 tick (volume) ...Not enough tick data history??? Please read page #1 post.  
First two days of the week, I'll be looking to sell the highs... with a TP target of 1.06100... Otherwise, I'll be buying the dips between 1.06050 - 1.05770

**Hurst Exponent** with _NET_ (a variation)

The Hurst Exponent is used as a measure of long-term memory of time series. It relates to the autocorrelations of the time series, and the rate at which these decrease as the lag between pairs of values increases. Studies involving the Hurst exponent were originally developed in hydrology for the practical matter of determining optimum dam sizing for the Nile river's volatile rain and drought conditions that had been observed over a long period of time. The name "Hurst exponent", or "Hurst coefficient", derives from Harold Edwin Hurst (1880 - 1978), who was the lead researcher in these studies; the use of the standard notation H for the coefficient relates to his name also.  
  
The Hurst exponent is referred to as the "index of dependence" or "index of long-range dependence". It quantifies the relative tendency of a time series either to regress strongly to the mean or to cluster in a direction.  
  
A value of H in the range 0.5 - 1 indicates a time series with long-term positive autocorrelation, meaning both that a high value in the series will probably be followed by another high value and that the values a long time into the future will also tend to be high.  
  
A value of H in the range 0 - 0.5 indicates a time series with long-term switching between high and low values in adjacent pairs, meaning that a single high value will probably be followed by a low value and that the value after that will tend to be high, with this tendency to switch between high and low values lasting a long time into the future.  
  
A value of H = 0.5 can indicate a completely uncorrelated series, but in fact it is the value applicable to series for which the autocorrelations at small time lags can be positive or negative but where the absolute values of the autocorrelations decay exponentially quickly to zero. This in contrast to the typically power law decay for the 0.5 < H < 1 and 0 < H < 0.5 cases.

_dynamic_**Hurst Exponent** with _NET_  
  
Hurst exponent estimation is a viable tool for analyzing the past. Looking at a correctly estimated H value can answer the following question: was the market persistent or was it anti-persistent? In its turn, that would help you analyze performance of your trading strategy or expert advisor during that particular period.

_  
This variation uses the featured technology below for the v2v dynamic trading system...  
  
☛ **Dynamic Zones by Leo Zamansky Ph.D. and David Stendahl**  
  
The Dynamic Zone indicator can elaborately show how it solves common trading complications. Extreme investing employs the use of oscillators to exploit tradeable trends in the market. This style of investing follows a very simple form of logic: only enter the market when an oscillator has moved far above or below traditional trading levels. However, these indicator-driven systems cannot evolve with the market because they use fixed buy and sell zones. Traders typically use one set of buy and sell zones for a bull market and substantially different zones for a bear market.  
  
Herein lie the complications. Once traders begin introducing their market opinions into trading equations, they negate the system's mechanical nature by changing the zones. The objective is to have a system automatically define its own buy and sell zones and thereby profitably trade in any market -- bull or bear. Dynamic Zones offer  
a solution to the complications of fixed buy and sell zones for any indicator-driven system.  
  
  
☛ **My NET ( Noise Elimination Technology )**  
  
The My Net is a technical indicator that employs Kendall correlation to remove nonlinear noise. Two main plots are calculated: My(Base) and NET wherein the bases are the following: RSI/RSX, T3-based RSI/RSX, and Elegant Oscillator. Each plot can be used as a confirmation of the other.  
  
My NET is a modified Relative Strength Index, similar to what is used in RocketRSI. It is calculated as the ratio of the sum of recent one-bar close price differences to the sum of absolute values of these differences.  
  
NET is calculated as Kendall correlation of My NET. The NET plot is less noisy than RSI, however, the usage of additional filters may be beneficial.  
  
  
☛ **SmoothStep function... (S0 & S1) fused with dynamic My NET**  
  
Returns a value from 0 to 1 that represents a parameter's proportional distance between a minimum and maximum value. The SmoothStep function lets you gradually increase an attribute such as Opacity from 0 to 1, but nonlinearly, over a time range.

**_Trend Quality_**** _-_****_Trend-noise Balance Indicator_**  
  
A few hours ago I uploaded this tool as another variation fused within the _**dynamic MyNET**_ which is under the umbrella of the **_v2v dynamic trading system_**  
  
The Trend-Quality indicator is a trend detection and estimation tool that is based on a two-step filtering technique. It measures cumulative price changes over term-oriented semicycles and relates them to “noise”. The approach reveals congestion and trending periods of the price movement and focuses on the most important trends, evaluating their strength in the process. The indicator is presented in a centered oscillator (Q-Indicator) and _**banded oscillator format (B-Indicator) ---**__**this variation uses dynamic bands**._  
  
  
The B-Indicator is a banded oscillator that fluctuates **orginally** between 0 and 100 _(again, this variation uses dynamic bands or zones)_ , is calculated by dividing the absolute value of trend by noise added to absolute value of trend, and scaling the result appropriately.  
  
The **B-indicator** doesn’t show the direction of price movement, but only the existence of the trend and its strength. It requires additional tools for reversal manifestations.  
The indicator’s interpretation is simple. The central line suggests that the trend and noise are in equilibrium (trend is equal to noise).  
  
Values:

  1. below **mid** or**50** **=** **Gold** _line color_ indicate ranging market
  2. in the **mid** to **65** range (or **+15** from**mid**)indicate weak trending
  3. in the **65** to **80** range (or **+30** from **mid**) indicate moderate trending
  4. **above 80** range (or **30+** from**mid**) indicate strong trending

  
The 65 level (or +15 from mid)can be thought of as the demarcation line of trending and ranging markets and can help determine which type of technical analysis indicator (lagging or leading) is better suited to current market conditions. Readings exceeding strong trending levels can indicate overbought or oversold conditions.

Trend Quality B-Indicator: _**Trend-noise Balance Indicator ( TBI )**__**.****.. and****Hurst Exponent ( HuE )**_  
  
**_B-Indicator_ **is a banded oscillator that fluctuates originally between 0 and 100 (again, this variation uses dynamic bands or zones). It is calculated by dividing absolute trend by noise added to absolute trend, and scaling the result as necessary. The B-indicator doesn’t show the direction of price movement, but only the existence of the trend and its strength. It requires additional tools for reversal manifestations.  
  
The Trend-Quality Indicator as described by David Sepiashvili in [Stocks & Commodities V. 22:4 (14-20)]. David Sepiashvili's article in this issue, "Trend-Quality Indicator," describes a method of assessing trend strength. To accomplish this, Sepiashvili uses a summing process to determine the cumulative price change (CPC). The CPC is reset to zero at every trend reversal. Trend reversals are based on the crossing of two moving averages. The CPC is "piecewise" averaged to produce the trend, which in turn is compared to a noise calculation to produce the quality indicator.  
  
  
The **_Hurst exponent_** is a measure for the behaviour of the market. It shows if the market behaves in a random, trending or mean-reversion manner. This can be used to select the right trading strategy for your market.  
  
In the 1970’s an American engineer called JM Hurst published a theory about why financial markets move in the way they do. The theory was the result of many years of research on powerful mainframe computers, and it became known as Hurst’s Cyclic Theory. Hurst claimed a 90% success rate trading on the basis of his theory, and yet the theory has remained largely undiscovered and often misunderstood.  
  
Studies involving the Hurst exponent were originally developed in hydrology for the practical matter of determining optimum dam sizing for the Nile river's volatile rain and drought conditions that had been observed over a long period of time.[1][2] The name "Hurst exponent", or "Hurst coefficient", derives from Harold Edwin Hurst (1880–1978), who was the lead researcher in these studies; the use of the standard notation H for the coefficient also relates to his name.

_Just How Long Will A Trend Go On?_  
  
**Trend Continuation Factor**  
**_by M.H. Pee_**  
  
_Yes, trends are important: They help you make money and they help you recover your losses._  
  
Because trends are an important component of the market, it is imperative you can detect them. However, it's not enough to just identify a trend. It's also crucial to be able to tell the direction of the current trend. Although trends can make you the most money in the shortest time when you are in sync with them, they can also cause you to sustain heavy losses if your position is in the opposite direction. To avoid getting caught in such a situation, I created the _trend continuation factor_(TCF), an indicator that identifies the trend and its direction.

  4. NEW: **Weighted Deviation (WTD)**  
...a variation inside dynamic MyNET which is under the umbrella of the v2v dynamic trading system  
  
This weighted deviation is a sort of all linear weighted deviation. It uses linear weighting in all the steps calculated (which makes it different from the built in deviation in a case when linear weighted ma is used in the ma method). It is more responsive than the standard deviation.

**Custom Candles - Any Time Frame**  
  
→ Added custom candles' starting session (**Broker,** **Sydney** _as default_ ,**Tokyo** , **London** , **New York**)

  1. Applicable only for... **_custom candle time frame that is less than or equal to H12 time frame_**
  2. Make sure you set your correct GMT offset time (your broker's server time)

→ Optimized dumb proof...

  1. In the event that global variables (for buttons/custom candles' TF current state) have been cleared, it will be reloaded using the default parameter values.

**v2v dynamic trading system** with **_ICT concepts_** in mind...  
  
Those horizontal lines on the charts provide you with additional technical bias information, which can support your overall directional probability.  
  
...As an alternative to using fibonacci levels, you could also use statistical quartiles to weigh premium versus discount.

For the time being.... This will be my last system update. Get the full system >>>**[HERE](https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/901713-v2v-dynamic-trading-system)**  
  
Earlier, I had a Eureka moment and I began to finalize the system for thorough testing starting next week. And then, I will trade this system with my own live trading account, and to a trading prop firm.  
  
Once I am satisfied with the testing results, I will trade this using another more trading accounts (multiple FX brokers). I am confident that this system will succeed.  
  
Finally, I will upload the updated v2v dynamic trading system, and then continue to refine the system as needed to ensure optimal performance.  
  
Many thanks to the admins for sharing and supporting this platform for us members to share new ideas in pursuit to become a consistent profitable trader.

An **MVWAP** is basically **an average of the VWAP values**. VWAP is only calculated per day, but MVWAP can move from day to day because it is an average of an average. This provides longer-term traders with a moving average volume-weighted price. The MVWAP on this system is using the period value from the Dominant Cycle Period tool (auto-generated)

**Before loading the v2v dynamic trading system onto your chart, please read and follow the following steps. The same steps should be followed for all currency pairs or instruments to ensure that enough tick/volume history is loaded. These are required for the system to run... particularly if you just recently (or first time) logged in to your "new" MT4 trading account (live/demo).**  
  
Step 1) Open an M1 chart  
Step 2) Press the "F2" key to load History Center  
Step 3) Navigate to the currency pair and the "1 Minute (M1)" history data for the chart you have open in your terminal (be sure to "double click" the "1 Minute (M1)" selection in the history center so it becomes the active selection)  
Step 4) Then left-click once on any of the data rows in the right-hand window of the History Center (it doesn't matter which one)  
Step 5) Click the "Add" button, this pops up another window titled "Bar" and the default selection is on the "year"  
Step 6) Enter 1970  
Step 7) Then select "OK"... and it creates a new bar with the timestamp and price info you just added.  
Step 8) Now select "Close" in the History Center  
Step 9) Navigate to your M1 chart of interest and then from the terminal window (press Ctrl-T) select "Journal "-> go to the main chart window and right-click the mouse button and select "Refresh"...this will refresh the chart and attempts to fill any time gaps in the chart data (which now includes your year 1970 data point) with server data  
  
...continued...  
  
Now your chart will have pulled anywhere from 2048 to 65536 M1 bars from your broker's server (not Metaquotes server) and is usually far more data than you can get the broker to cough up when you try and manually scroll your M1 chart back in time.

If everything turned out fine... then you've quickly downloaded all the broker's M1 data on your currency pair that the broker can let you have, much faster than holding down the home or page-up key for minutes and minutes to get even fewer data. Now, you may continue with the rest of the timeframes. Don't forget to delete any 1970 dummy tick data after it downloads more history, then you may need to verify that after the deletion (1970 record) the maximum historical data has been obtained, otherwise add the 1970 record again.  
  
Note (for first-time users): The v2v dynamic system must grow with the MT4 platform as it requires a broad tick data history.  
  
Once the platform gathers enough data, the system will no longer display an error message (viewed via Expert logs). Such as..."not enough tick data to calculate", "data horizon breach", and "array out of range".

☛ **RSI with NET ( Noise Elimination Technology ) **  
  
The "RSI With Noise Elimination Technology" (NET) is an indicator developed by John Elhers. The indicator is simply **a rolling Kendall rank correlation coefficient of a normalized momentum oscillator** (a version of the RSI introduced by Elhers in the May 2018 issue of Stocks & Commodities).  
  
As a technical indicator, NET employs Kendall correlation to eliminate nonlinear noise. However, the application of additional filters reimagined a popular tool under the v2v dynamic trading system...**dynamic MyNET**  
  
The NET is a modified version of the RocketRSI Relative Strength Index. A one-bar close price difference is calculated as the ratio between their absolute values and the sum of the recent one-bar close price differences.

It doesn't hurts with **_Hurst Exponent_**  
  
The Hurst exponent indicates whether a time series behaves randomly, trending, or mean-reverting. In this case, the autocorrelation increases with lag, resulting in a decreasing speed of autocorrelation. Therefore, it is an excellent trading tool.  
  
The Hurst exponent is a measure of the memory in a time series and is used to classify the series as mean-reverting, trending, or a random walk. depending on the choice of the maximum lag parameter (i.e., whether we are looking for short or long term), the results can differ significantly.

**_  
A brief history of Hurst Phenomenon...  
  
The **Hurst exponent** is used as a measure of long-term memory of time series. It relates to the autocorrelations of the time series, and the rate at which these decrease as the lag between pairs of values increases. Studies involving the Hurst exponent were originally developed in hydrology for the practical matter of determining optimum dam sizing for the Nile river's volatile rain and drought conditions that had been observed over a long period of time. The name "Hurst exponent", or "Hurst coefficient", derives from [Harold Edwin Hurst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Edwin_Hurst) (1880–1978), who was the lead researcher in these studies; the use of the standard notation _H_ for the coefficient also relates to his name.

**dynamic MyNET =**► _**McGinley Dynamic**_  
  
The McGinley Dynamic indicator is a type of moving average that was designed to track the market better than existing moving average indicators. It is a technical indicator that improves upon moving average lines by adjusting for shifts in market speed. John R. McGinley, a market technician, is the inventor of the eponymous indicator.

KEY TAKEAWAYS

  1. The McGinley Dynamic indicator is a type of moving average that was designed to track the market better than existing moving average indicators.
  2. This indicator solves the issue of varying market speeds by incorporating an automatic adjustment factor into its formula, which speeds (or slows) the indicator in trending, or ranging, markets.
  3. The McGinley Dynamic indicator improves upon conventional moving averages by minimizing price separations and volatile whipsaws so that price action is more accurately reflected.

Understanding McGinley Dynamic Indicator  
The McGinley Dynamic indicator attempts to solve a problem inherent in moving averages that use fixed time lengths. The basic problem is that the market, being the great discounting mechanism that it is, reacts to events at a speed that a moving average will not be able to cope with.  
This issue is called the lag, and there is no type of moving average, whether it be simple (SMA), exponential (EMA), or weighted (LWMA), that is not affected by this. Understandably, this will call into question the reliability of that moving average. The McGinley Dynamic indicator takes into account speed changes in a market (hence, "dynamic") to show a smoother, more responsive, moving average line.  
  
The speed of the market is not consistent; it frequently speeds up and slows down. Traditional moving averages, such as a simple moving average or an exponential moving average, fail to account for this market characteristic. The McGinley Dynamic indicator solves this problem by incorporating an automatic smoothing factor into its formula to adjust to market moves. This speeds, or slows, the indicator in trending, or ranging, markets.  
  
This is not to say that the aforementioned issue of lag has been eradicated, only that the reaction to market movement is faster. The key point to note is that, due to its smoothing constant, it will be more market reactive than other moving averages. The user can customize this indicator through the selection of the number of periods.

_Just How Long Will A Trend Go On?_  
  
**Trend Continuation Factor**  
**_by M.H. Pee_**  
  
_Yes, trends are important: They help you make money and they help you recover your losses._  
  
Because trends are an important component of the market, it is imperative you can detect them. However, it's not enough to just identify a trend. It's also crucial to be able to tell the direction of the current trend. Although trends can make you the most money in the shortest time when you are in sync with them, they can also cause you to sustain heavy losses if your position is in the opposite direction. To avoid getting caught in such a situation, I created the _trend continuation factor_(TCF), an indicator that identifies the trend and its direction.

Trend Quality B-Indicator : _Trend-noise Balance Indicator_  
  
**_B-Indicator_ **is a banded oscillator that fluctuates originally between 0 and 100 (again, this variation uses dynamic bands or zones). It is calculated by dividing absolute trend by noise added to absolute trend, and scaling the result as necessary. The B-indicator doesn’t show the direction of price movement, but only the existence of the trend and its strength. It requires additional tools for reversal manifestations.  
  
The Trend-Quality Indicator as described by David Sepiashvili in [Stocks & Commodities V. 22:4 (14-20)]. David Sepiashvili's article in this issue, "Trend-Quality Indicator," describes a method of assessing trend strength. To accomplish this, Sepiashvili uses a summing process to determine the cumulative price change (CPC). The CPC is reset to zero at every trend reversal. Trend reversals are based on the crossing of two moving averages. The CPC is "piecewise" averaged to produce the trend, which in turn is compared to a noise calculation to produce the quality indicator.

**dynamic MyNET** ► _**SmoothStep function....**_  
  
There are many cases in which we need normalized values (computer graphics, machine learning, technical analysis). There are several ways to accomplish this, including SmoothStep. It belongs to the family of sigmoidal (clamping in this case, since this indicator, as it is, is not used for interpolation) functions, and it produces a subset of what is the built-in stochastic, except that in its original range of 0 to 1 and that it filters out some values that stochastic produces. This makes SmoothStep more suitable for some applications, such as clamping, where you don't want to have values above or below the desired range. Additionally, SmoothStep is computationally efficient, making it a good choice for applications where speed is a priority.

**_  
This version is using a property of a smooth step that it can be further smoothed - based on **Kenneth H. Perlin's** (a professor in the Department of Computer Science at New York University) idea. His work centered around something called “Sigmoid Function” having a characteristic “S”-shaped curve or sigmoid curve which eventually levels off.

The sigmoid function is a special case of a logistic function that has S-shaped characteristic.  
  
**Properties of Sigmoid Function**

  1. Domain: (-infinite, +infinite)
  2. Range: (0, 1)
  3. x(0) = ½ = 0.5
  4. The sigmoid function is continuous and monotonically increasing everywhere.
  5. The function is differentiable everywhere.
  6. Maps feature space into probability function:  
– When x-> \+ infinity, the value of the sigmoid function will be close to 1.  
– When x-> -infinity, the value of the sigmoid function will be close to 0.  
– For x = 0, the value of the sigmoid function will be ½.

**Advantages and Limitations of Sigmoid Function**

  1. It gives a smooth gradient that prevents jumps in output values.
  2. One of the best-normalized functions.
  3. When used with a linear function, it will return a value between 0 and 1, which does not make the activation value disappear.
  4. Gradient values are only significant for the range -3 to 3.  
The graph will have minimal gradients for values greater than 3 or smaller than -3.
  5. The main disadvantage of the sigmoid function is that it suffers from the vanishing gradient problem.  
As the gradient value approaches zero, the network ceases to learn and suffers from a vanishing gradient descent problem
  6. When sigmoid is used and:  
Inputs are non-zero centered; then saturation is a concern  
– Saturation implies gradient will be zero.
  7. Extremely greater or smaller values are mapped to the extremities to 0 and 1.

  
►**UPDATES:**

  1. A button has been added to the SmoothStep, and its calculation has been optimized.
  2. Restore the button for Vertical Horizontal Filter (VHF) as well

**Please read the below information before loading the v2v dynamic trading system (templates) on your chart.**  
  
**Each currency pair or instrument must follow the following steps to load enough tick/volume history. Thus, these are required for the system to function properly... especially if this is your first time logging-in to your (new) live/demo account.**  
  
Step 1) Open an M1 chart  
Step 2) Press the "F2" key to load History Center  
Step 3) Navigate to the currency pair and the "1 Minute (M1)" history data for the chart you have open in your terminal (be sure to "double click" the "1 Minute (M1)" selection in the history center so it becomes the active selection)  
Step 4) Then left-click once on any of the data rows in the right-hand window of the History Center (it doesn't matter which one)  
Step 5) Click the "Add" button, this pops up another window titled "Bar" and the default selection is on the "year"  
Step 6) Enter 1970  
Step 7) Then select "OK"... and it creates a new bar with the timestamp and price info you just added.  
Step 8) Now select "Close" in the History Center  
Step 9) Navigate to your M1 chart of interest and then from the terminal window (press Ctrl-T) select "Journal "-> go to the main chart window and right-click the mouse button and select "Refresh"...this will refresh the chart and attempts to fill any time gaps in the chart data (which now includes your year 1970 data point) with server data

...continued...  
  
The chart will now have pulled anywhere between 2048 and 65536 M1 bars from your broker's server (not Metaquotes), which is usually more data than you can manually scroll back in time when you manually scroll your M1 chart.  
  
If everything went smoothly... then you've quickly downloaded all the broker's M1 data on your currency pair that the broker can let you have. This is much faster than holding down the home or page-up key for minutes and minutes to get even fewer data. Now, you may continue with the rest of the timeframes. Once more history is downloaded, be sure to delete any 1970 dummy tick data. Next, you may need to verify that after the deletion (1970 record) the maximum historical data has been obtained, otherwise add the 1970 record again.  
  
  
**Note (for first-time users):** The v2v dynamic system must grow with the MT4 platform as it requires a broad tick data history.  
  
Once the platform gathers enough data, the system will no longer display an error message (viewed via Expert logs). Such as..."**not enough tick data to calculate** ", "**data horizon breach** ", and "**array out of range** ".

RMA, which is a variation of SMA, was used to filter NWE using phase accumulation of MACD values. In comparison with a regular EMA, it produces almost as fast as a regular one.  
  
**Note:** The other ones that uses RMA using phase accumulation of MACD inside dynamic MyNET are... LrQ, HuE, TBI, and WmD

> The **Relative Moving Average (RMA)** indicator is a technical analysis tool commonly used in financial markets to identify trends and potential entry and exit points for trading positions. It is a variation of the traditional moving average indicator, designed to provide a more accurate representation of price movements by taking into account the relative strength of the underlying security.  
>    
>  The RMA indicator calculates the average price over a specified period of time, similar to the simple moving average (SMA). However, unlike the SMA, which assigns equal weight to each data point, the RMA assigns greater weight to more recent price data points. This weighting scheme allows the RMA to react more quickly to price changes and provide a more timely signal.  
>    
>  To calculate the RMA, the indicator takes the sum of the closing prices over the specified period and divides it by the sum of the weighting factors. The weighting factors are determined by the length of the period and follow a specific formula that assigns higher weights to more recent data points.  
>    
>  Traders and analysts use the RMA indicator to identify trends in price movements. When the RMA is rising, it suggests that the underlying security is experiencing an uptrend, indicating a potential buying opportunity. Conversely, when the RMA is falling, it indicates a downtrend, signaling a potential selling opportunity.  
>    
>  The RMA indicator can also be used to generate trading signals based on crossovers with other moving averages or price levels. For example, when the RMA crosses above a longer-term moving average, it may be interpreted as a bullish signal, indicating a potential trend reversal or continuation.  
>    
>  One of the advantages of the RMA indicator is its ability to adapt to changing market conditions. By giving greater weight to recent price data, it is more responsive to short-term price fluctuations and can help traders capture shorter-term trends.  
>    
>  However, it is important to note that like any technical indicator, the RMA is not infallible and should be used in conjunction with other analysis tools and risk management strategies. It is also crucial to consider the context of the market and other factors that may influence price movements.  
>    
>  In conclusion, the Relative Moving Average (RMA) indicator is a technical analysis tool used by traders and analysts to identify trends and potential trading opportunities. It provides a more accurate representation of price movements by assigning greater weight to more recent data points. By using the RMA indicator in conjunction with other analysis tools, traders can enhance their decision-making process and potentially improve their trading outcomes.

The **_D_**** _etrended Ehlers Leading Indicator_** (DELI) was authored by Jon Ehlers (See “MESA and Trading Market Cycles” by John Ehlers). The DELI uses highs, previous high, lows, previous lows and feedback to create two exponential moving averages. First, Detrended Synthetic Price (DSP) is plotted as their difference. Then a third exponential moving average is created from the DSP and the DELI is plotted as their difference.  
  
The **Kaufman Adaptive Moving Average** (KAMA) is a technical analysis indicator developed by the American quantitative financial theorist Perry J. Kaufman in 1998. KAMA is a trend-following indicator that uses a series of calculations to adapt to market conditions and reduce noise.

A _**M odified Moving **__**A**_ _**verage**_ (MMA) — Otherwise known as the**_R unning Moving Average_** _or_ _**R**_ _**elative Moving Average**_, or **_S_** _**M**_** _oothed Moving Average_ **(SMMA) is an indicator that shows the average value of a security's price over a period of time. It works very similar to the Exponential Moving Average, they are equivalent but for different periods (e.g., the MMA value for a 14-day period will be the same as EMA-value for a 27-days period).  
  
MMA is partly calculated like SMA: the first point of the MMA is calculated the same way it is done for SMA. However, other points are calculated differently:the new price is added first and then the last average is subtracted from the resulting sum.

> In time series analysis, singular spectrum analysis (SSA) is a nonparametric spectral estimation method. It combines elements of classical time series analysis, multivariate statistics, multivariate geometry, dynamical systems, and signal processing —Wikipedia

  
  
The goal is to use this scientific tool for technical analysis. In order to understand SSA, we should focus on what it does rather than what it is. In this method, time series are decomposed and reconstructed.

With Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA), we break down all the oscillations in a series into a few eigenvectors, which represent oscillation patterns. Furthermore, the significance of these patterns or eigenvalues is estimated.  
  
“Eigen” is a German word, translating to “characteristic”. Eigenvectors are structure functions that effectively represent price modes of behavior. The eigenvalues measure the variance these modes account for. The eigenvectors can be ordered by eigenvalue, highest to lowest, so that the first few patterns retain most of the variance in the data. As a whole, the ordered eigenvalues are referred to as the singular spectrum.

**Note:** **SSA** is basically _**recalculates**_  
  
The above screenshot shows that the RMA is ON with SSA. RMA adapts to changing market conditions. By giving greater weight to recent price data, it is more responsive to short-term price fluctuations and can help traders capture shorter-term trends. Therefore, it provides a more accurate representation of price movements by assigning greater weight to more recent data points. Hence, by using the RMA in conjunction with SSA, traders can enhance their decision-making process and potentially improve their trading outcomes.  
  
However, it is important to note that like any technical indicator, the SSA & RMA is not infallible and should be used in conjunction with other (your own tried & tested) analysis tools and risk management strategies. It is also crucial to consider the context of the market and other factors that may influence price movements.

**Singular Spectrum Analysis (****SSA****)** is a technique used in time-series analysis to decompose a time series into its underlying components and extract meaningful patterns, trends, and cyclic behavior. SSA has found applications in various fields, including finance and trading.  
  
In trading, Singular Spectrum Analysis can be employed for time-series forecasting, noise reduction, and signal extraction. It helps traders and analysts identify hidden patterns and trends in financial data, which can be used for making informed decisions and developing trading strategies.  
  
The basic steps of Singular Spectrum Analysis are as follows:

  1. Embedding: The time series is embedded into a trajectory matrix by stacking consecutive time-delayed versions of the series. This matrix represents the trajectory of the time series in a higher-dimensional space.
  2. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD): The trajectory matrix is decomposed using Singular Value Decomposition, which involves breaking down the matrix into three components: left singular vectors, singular values, and right singular vectors.
  3. Grouping: The singular values and vectors are grouped to form components that capture the underlying structures in the time series. These components represent the trend, cyclic patterns, and noise in the data.
  4. Reconstruction: The identified components are combined to reconstruct the original time series. Depending on the specific application, traders may use specific components or their combinations for various purposes, such as forecasting or noise reduction.

The advantage of SSA is its ability to handle non-linear and non-stationary time series, which are common characteristics of financial data. By separating the components of a time series, traders can focus on specific patterns, trends, or cyclic behavior and potentially gain insights into market behavior and develop trading strategies accordingly.  
  
However, like any analytical technique, SSA also has limitations and requires careful parameter selection and interpretation of results. As with any trading analysis method, it's essential to combine SSA with other tools, perform robustness tests, and consider risk management when implementing trading strategies. Traders should exercise caution and consider using SSA as part of a comprehensive trading analysis toolkit rather than relying solely on this method.

In trading, the **Nadaraya-Watson Estimator (****NWE****)** , also known as kernel regression is a statistical method used for non-parametric regression and prediction tasks. It is named after its inventors, E.P. Nadaraya and G. Watson, who introduced it in the 1960s.  
  
The NWE is commonly used in finance and trading for modeling relationships between variables and making predictions based on historical data. It is particularly useful when the relationship between variables is non-linear and cannot be adequately described by simple linear models.  
  
The NWE can be applied to various trading-related tasks, including:

  1. Forecasting: Traders and analysts can use the estimator to predict future values of financial instruments, such as stock prices or exchange rates, based on historical data.
  2. Smoothing: The estimator can help remove noise or fluctuations from a time series, providing a clearer view of underlying trends and patterns.
  3. Signal Extraction: Traders may use the Nadaraya-Watson estimator to identify underlying signals in noisy data, helping them make informed decisions in financial markets.

The basic idea behind the Nadaraya-Watson estimator is to estimate the conditional expectation of a dependent variable (e.g., stock price) given an independent variable (e.g., time or market index). It does this by assigning weights to observed data points based on their proximity to the target point and their relevance to the prediction. The closer the data point to the target point, the higher its weight in the estimation process.  
  
Mathematically, for a set of data points (x_i, y_i), where x_i is the independent variable and y_i is the dependent variable, and for a new input value x, the Nadaraya-Watson estimator is defined as follows:  
E(y | x) = (∑[i=1 to n] K((x - x_i) / h) * y_i) / (∑[i=1 to n] K((x - x_i) / h))  
Where:

  1. K(u) is the kernel function, a symmetric function that determines the weight assigned to each data point based on its distance from the target point (x).
  2. h is the bandwidth parameter, controlling the width of the neighborhood used to estimate the conditional expectation. It affects the smoothness of the estimator and should be carefully chosen to achieve optimal results.

The choice of the kernel function and bandwidth parameter depends on the specific characteristics of the data and the underlying relationship between the variables. Traders typically use cross-validation or other optimization techniques to determine the most suitable values for these parameters.  
  
Overall, the Nadaraya-Watson estimator provides traders with a flexible and powerful tool for analyzing time series data and making predictions in financial markets, especially when traditional linear models may not be sufficient to capture the complexity of market dynamics.

The _**SmoothStep**_ _**function**_ is a mathematical function commonly used in computer graphics and animation to create smooth transitions or animations between two values over a specified range. In the context of trading, the SmoothStep function might be used for smoothing price data or generating signals for trading strategies that involve gradual transitions.  
  
The _SmoothStep_ _function_ takes three arguments: an input value (usually normalized within a specified range), a minimum value of the range, and a maximum value of the range. It returns a value between 0 and 1, providing a smooth interpolation between the minimum and maximum values.  
  
The formula for the _SmoothStep function_ is as follows:  
  
SmoothStep(x) = 3 * x^2 - 2 * x^3  
where x is the normalized input value within the range [0, 1]. The normalized input value is calculated as (input - minimum) / (maximum - minimum), so it falls within the [0, 1] range.  
  
The function has the following properties:

  1. SmoothStep(0) = 0: The function returns 0 when the input value is at its minimum.
  2. SmoothStep(1) = 1: The function returns 1 when the input value is at its maximum.
  3. SmoothStep'(0) = 0 and SmoothStep'(1) = 0: The first derivative is 0 at both ends, resulting in smooth transitions.

In trading, the _SmoothStep function_ can be used for various purposes, such as:

  1. Smoothing Price Data: Traders might use the SmoothStep function to smooth out noisy price data, making it easier to identify trends or patterns.
  2. Generating Trading Signals: The function can be used to generate trading signals based on smoothed indicators or price data. For example, a SmoothStep function might be applied to an oscillator to generate buy or sell signals when it crosses certain thresholds smoothly.
  3. Risk Management: The SmoothStep function could also be used to create smooth transitions in position sizing or risk allocation strategies.

When using the SmoothStep function in trading strategies, it's important to consider the specific context and adjust the range and parameters of the function according to the characteristics of the data and the desired outcomes. As with any trading tool or function, it should be tested thoroughly and combined with other analysis techniques for robust decision-making.

**KAMA** stands for **Kaufman Adaptive Moving Average** , and it is a type of adaptive moving average used in technical analysis and trading. The KAMA was developed by Perry Kaufman and introduced in his book "Smarter Trading" in 1993.  
  
The KAMA is designed to be adaptive, meaning that it dynamically adjusts its smoothing period based on market conditions. Traditional moving averages use fixed time periods, such as 10, 50, or 200 periods, which can result in lagging signals during choppy or volatile market conditions. In contrast, the KAMA aims to be more responsive during trending markets and smoother during sideways or ranging markets.  
  
The calculation of the KAMA involves three main steps:

  1. Efficiency Ratio (ER): The Efficiency Ratio measures the price movement relative to the average true range (ATR) over a specified period. It helps determine the level of noise or volatility in the market.  
ER = |Close - Close (n) | / Sum of |Close (i) - Close (i-1)| for i = 1 to n  
Where "Close" refers to the current closing price, "Close (n)" is the closing price n periods ago, and n is the lookback period for the efficiency ratio calculation.
  2. Smoothing Constant (SC): The Smoothing Constant determines the level of responsiveness of the KAMA to recent price movements. A low SC results in a more stable and smoother KAMA, while a higher SC makes it more responsive to recent price changes.
  3. Adaptive Constant (AC): The Adaptive Constant adjusts the smoothing period of the KAMA based on the Efficiency Ratio. It ensures that the KAMA shortens during high volatility and lengthens during low volatility.

Once the Efficiency Ratio, Smoothing Constant, and Adaptive Constant are calculated, the KAMA is computed using the following formula:  
  
KAMA = KAMA (prev) + SC * (Price - KAMA (prev))  
Where "KAMA (prev)" is the KAMA value of the previous period, "Price" is the current price, and "SC" is the smoothing constant.  
  
Traders often use the KAMA as a trend-following indicator or as a component in more complex trading systems. It can be used to generate buy and sell signals based on crossovers with other moving averages or as a reference for determining the prevailing trend in the market. As with any trading indicator, it is essential to combine the KAMA with other tools and conduct thorough testing before incorporating it into a trading strategy.

**dynamic MyNET ► _Arnaud Legoux Moving Average (ALMA)_**  
  
As the name suggests, the ALMA indicator is a moving average (MA) variant and was created by Arnaud Legoux in 2009. The goal was to decrease the lag commonly encountered with moving averages.  
  
• Added ALMA as another MA method (AMA, RMA, KAMA, ALMA, NEMA, DEMA, TEMA)  
• Updated the default parameter values... As a result, _please make use of the templates provided_ _._

**dynamic MyNET ► _synthetic VIX_ _(sVIX)_**  
  
• Added the **sVIX**  
  
The S _ynthetic VIX_ Indicator is a market volatility meter. For calculating the volatility index, it closely monitors price-action changes. In order to determine the level of price volatility, we use the index value as a scale.  
  
Initially, this indicator was developed to track the level of volatility in the S&P 500. Today, you can use S _ynthetic VIX _ for analyzing forex currency pairs and other types of trading assets.  
  
Furthermore, it offers the easiest demonstration of price index states when compared with other MT4 volatility indicators. This is a good technical indicator for beginners. Moreover, it works well for experienced traders as well.  
  
Here is the formula → _based on Larry Williams’ article "Fix the VIX":_  
S _ynthetic VIX value = [{Highest(Close,Period) – Low}/{Highest(Close,Period)}]_  
  
  
_**Now...** below is the variation of **Synthetic VIX**_ ► the **sVIX** under **_dynamic MyNET_**

**dynamic MyNET ► Lambda (λ)**  
  
Lambda calculus (also written as λ-calculus) is **a formal system in mathematical logic for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application using variable binding and substitution**. It is a universal model of computation that can be used to simulate any Turing machine.  
  
Added Lambda as a vertical-horizontal filter for the following tools ONLY...  
• Nadaraya-Watson Estimator (NWE)  
• Weighted-momentum Deviation (WmD)

**dynamic MyNET ► _UPDATES_**  
  
• This is for faster parameter (v2v system) configuration changes, as well as chart trading operations (e.g. buy/sell, and trade management):  
  
— By switching back to ON for dynamic MyNET... SSA (Singular Spectrum Analysis)  and Lambda (λ-Calculus)  states are turned off.  
— Switch ON the MTF mode... SSA and Lambda states are turned off. You may enable it again as needed.

The one major thing I must work on is Managing Risk. I have no issues trading with my systematically designed trading system on my personal accounts. However, if ever I venture with a prop-funded account, I must work/improve on that area much more.

By mid November I'll be testing... with a different mindset.  
\- Take the losses. 100% win rate is not possible ; )-  
\- Be more serious (e.g. managing risk, price monitoring) and don't get greedy.  
\- Position sizing more accurately based on my account size (margin size)  
\- Add extra amount of patience.  
  
  
Hmmm... 'till next time...

**v2v dynamic trading system** ► _**TMA centered Bands**_

The only independent tool within the system is the Custom-Candle Any-TF.  
  
...TMA centered Bands is part of the VP-R MomenTicks (volume profile range tool). From the previous posted screenshot... I pointed a button with "TMA" text.  
  
If you want only the independent TMA centered Bands... You may get the original here >>> [HERE](https://forex-station.com/post1294931658.html#p1294931658)

I am not feeling well health-wise at the moment. But I have an update or fix for the PIVOT FIBS plus tool regarding the base price midpoints (VWAP, PIVOT, PVP...etc.).  
I will upload this as soon as I feel much better.   
  
Warm & Kindest regards,

I just wanted to remind the users of v2v dynamic trading system (if there are any) ; )--- are mainly to anticipate a probability of price move... a reversal, retracement, and a trend. And most importantly to manage your trades entries and exits.   
  
You must develop your own strategy/plan with this system so you would be able to create/develop a neural pathway for your own edge in trading. Don't simply say/predict a movement of the price after the fact... Just humble yourself, be positive and systematically trade with utmost passion, trust and patience.   
  
During such process... You may lose a lot of trades, but I am confident that you will have more winning and profitable trades in the long run.

**Operational setup:**  
• If you're finding it difficult to switch between system options or modify your chart screen and setup, you may need to**turn OFF** the **dynamic MyNET** or **Hidden Gap** finder (or set lower start bar parameter value). This will enable faster and easier switching. For instance, when you want to move or set up SL & TP, or when you want to close existing positions. After you're done, you can turn it **back ON** as required.

**v2v dynamic trading system** ► _**Upcoming updates by next weekend**_  
  
**PIVOT FIBS plus:**  
Added Midday Tokyo session (12:00 PM)   
  
  
**Custom Candle Any-TF with Hidden Volume Gap (or FVG):**  
An option to run the volume gap finder just once, and then have it continuously check if the current candle bar mitigates drawn volume gaps. However, no new hidden gaps would be drawn. Then, the gap finder should run again as soon as a new candle appears, based on the current chart time frame. But all of this resets back once you navigate through the buttons. Currently, the volume gap finder runs on each new tick data, which may slow down your chart. Its speed also depends on the input value for the StartBar parameter.

If the VWAP is higher than the PVP (Peak Volume Price) or PoC (Point of Control), it indicates that more volume has been traded above the PVP than below it. This means that the distribution function is skewed to the upside, and it is expected that the price will move up when it reaches the PVP.  
  
On the other hand, if the VWAP is lower than the PVP, it indicates that more volume has been traded below the PVP than above it. This means that the distribution function is skewed to the downside, and it is expected that the price will move down when it reaches the PVP.  
  
If the VWAP is approximately equal to the PVP, then the distribution function is symmetric. In this case, when the price touches the PVP, there is no expectation of price movement in either direction. Instead, small oscillations about the VWAP should be expected.  
  
Given the information above... ICT concept traders must not disregard the importance of "ICT 2023 Mentorship - Market Maker Models".

✜ **v2v dynamic trading system** ✜ ─ _for the MT4 platform_  
  
A **_Project Lookin' Glass_ **by v2v...  
  
Introducing the v2v dynamic trading system, a groundbreaking solution tailored to the retail trading environment. At its core, the system is powered by the Dominant Cycle Period (DCP) and MomenTicks, an advanced, volume-weighted momentum algorithm.  
  
The v2v dynamic trading system sets itself apart from conventional approaches by eschewing traditional elements such as directional arrows or trigger alerts for buy/sell signals. Instead, it fosters a more analytical and strategic mindset, challenging users to engage in critical thinking when navigating the complexities of the market. This unique design empowers traders, like yourself, to make informed decisions and capitalize on emerging opportunities.

As an evolving and continually updated system, the v2v dynamic trading platform does not come with a traditional user manual. Users are encouraged to exercise due diligence and proactively explore its features to fully understand and harness its capabilities.  
  
To embark on this journey, it is essential to embrace a fresh perspective that acknowledges the intricate landscape of modern trading. By cultivating a strong belief in your potential and resilience, you can confidently navigate the market and challenge traditional limitations.  
  
And now...  
  
“ _Take a deep breath, relax, and start believing we are living in the Matrix, where the Market (Makers) can't kill you, but the Market thinks they can. Then... As you walk with the Architect from beyond (who holds the Akashic records), you'll begin to observe what is happening while a newly developed neural pathway to the art (or science) of trading is designed for you. With the guidance of powerful tools offered by this system, you will uncover new insights and develop your own unique approach to trading. Complemented by a well-crafted strategy, effective risk management techniques, and a trustworthy broker, you will pave the way towards sustained profitability and success as you gain invaluable experience._ ” ─ Agent v2v  
  
That said, be sure to...  
  
“ _Trust in the Lord with all of your heart and lean not on your understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight_ ”   
─Proverbs 3:5-6 NIV  
  
The v2v dynamic trading system is tailored to suit the needs of discretionary traders who utilize a systematic trading plan or strategy. By employing this system, users may find it beneficial in managing their trades or adjusting current positions, thereby optimizing their overall trading performance. Moreover, this system can aid in identifying potential opportunities and determining an average or overall directional probability, leading to more informed decision-making.  
  
Please bear in mind that the v2v dynamic trading system is a work in progress, and there is always scope for further refinement and improvement. Your valuable ideas and suggestions are appreciated, and while they may not necessarily be incorporated, they will certainly be taken into consideration as we continue to develop and enhance the system.

**UPDATES:****New scripts added to the v2v dynamic trading system**

  1. LoadHistory_M1-data_Only
  2. LoadHistory_All_TF-data

  
**Before using the v2v dynamic trading system (templates), please review the following information:**  
  
**Loading Historical Data(New STEPS to follow)**  
  
If you are a new user or have recently opened an account with your trusted broker, follow these steps (refer to the screenshots below):

  1. Go to the History Center: Tools menu > History Center  

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Size: 136 KB](/attachment/image/4718275/thumbnail?d=1715844779)](/attachment/image/4718275?d=1715844779)   

  2. Run the script: LoadHistory_M1-data_Only

Once the process is complete, your MT4 chart will be populated with an additional number of bars between 2048 and 65536 M1 bars sourced directly from your broker's server (not Metaquotes). This imported data usually surpasses the amount that can be retrieved normally, providing the v2v dynamic trading system more historical tick dataset available for analysis.

  1. Afterward, delete any dummy tick data from 1970 to maintain accuracy. If you haven't obtained the maximum historical data post-deletion, re-add the 1970 record temporarily and repeat the process.
  2. This approach efficiently acquires maximum M1 data for your selected currency pair. Proceed to download data for other timeframes as needed.

**Important Notes:**

  1. The v2v dynamic trading system uses M1 historical tick data by default. Load other TF data using the same steps.
  2. The system needs a broad tick data history, so it should grow with the MT4 platform.
  3. As the platform gathers data, error messages ("not enough tick data to calculate", "data horizon breach", and "array out of range") should no longer appear in the Expert logs.

  
It is important to emphasize that the v2v dynamic trading system is designed for experienced users and may not be suitable for beginners. A strong understanding of its workings is crucial to utilize this system successfully. If you find the system too complex, exploring other options that better align with your current skill level would be best.  
  
Effectively utilizing the v2v dynamic trading system requires due diligence, resourcefulness, and familiarity with third-party tools and indicators. With sufficient trading experience, users can better determine if the system suits their needs without resorting to negative criticism towards its creator. Remember, this system is offered free of charge, and the effort invested in its development should be appreciated.

**Guidelines:**  
• Essential Steps for New Users: Carefully follow the outlined steps provided**→ [HERE](https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/post/14869337#post14869337)**  
• Utilizing the v2v Templates (with stripped template - v2v_simple | v2v_simple_vpr): Users**must** use it for optimal performance.  
•  To learn more about the system, users are encouraged to visit **→ [HERE](https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/901713-v2v-dynamic-trading-system)**  
  
**Operational setup:**  
For smoother navigation when adjusting your chart screen and settings, consider temporarily disabling certain features like **dynamic MyNET** or**Hidden Gap finder** (**turn OFF**). Reducing the start bar parameter value can also help. This will allow for a more seamless experience when setting stop-loss and take-profit levels, closing existing positions, or making other adjustments. Remember once done, you can always reactivate these features (**turn back to ON**).

The Weighted Average Price (WAP) chart setup offers a novel way of analyzing price movement in relation to the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP). By utilizing the Z distance from WAP, traders can gauge the deviation of the current price from the WAP line, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of market trends and opportunities. Incorporating the WAP into your technical analysis can lead to a richer comprehension of market behavior, enabling you to make more informed and confident trading decisions.

**For improved on-chart behavior:**  
→  Dynamic MyNET will be disabled once the top correlation pairs are enabled. You may re-enable it as needed.  
→  Dynamic MyNET will also be disabled if you double-click the vertical line guides of the Volume Profile - Range.  
  
And this can be re-enabled when necessary

**Please take note of the following**** _upcoming updates and fixes_****:**  
  
→ **Dynamic MyNET** : Addressing small issues with the MTF mode by ensuring that the Z-score and dynamic band values reset back to the current timeframe as expected. Additionally, change the color of the navigational button text to match the current MTF mode (OFF/ON).  
  
→ **v2v Power** : I have added a new power button for easier switching between ON/OFF states.

I have closed my existing sell positions. Now, I shall seize the opportunity to buy low while the metaphorical blood flows in the streets. After all, a wise trader once said, 'When fear grips the market, buy. When euphoria grips the market, sell.'

Updated positions... new TP @ 1.07670  
  
Given the current price movement, there's a potential for the price to remain within the value area. I'll closely monitor the current 1-hour candle (at post time), particularly for any failure of the price to close above 1.07370. If this occurs, I will act swiftly to exit my existing buy position, safeguarding against potential losses. Conversely, should the price manage to break through 1.07370, I'll capitalize on this development by initiating a new buy position.

I made a move after the previous 1-hour candle closed above the resistance level of 1.07370. I added another buy position and set up a pending order slightly below the new entry price. Now I can rest with confidence in my decision. Nightnight from my end.

Oh, dear me! My crystal ball must be on the fritz because it’s painting a different picture than what my strategy intended. How will I slumber now, knowing I might be sailing adrift in a sea of uncertainty? Perhaps I should take a page out of the Beatles’ book and “Let It Be...”

With the EUR/USD pair moving steadily, I am feeling quite content (at post time). However, I will stay cautious, as the markets are like the ocean - sometimes calm and peaceful, but also susceptible to sudden and unpredictable storms. As I head to bed, I'll rely on my subconscious to watch for any signs of trouble ahead... While my dreams are filled with the gentle lapping of waves on the shore of profitability. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60c.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f30a.png?v=15.1) I wish!

EUR/USD: an update... current position  
  
With the calculated precision of a veteran astronaut, I’ve secured profits for some of my buy entries from yesterday and earlier today. Now, one final rocket ascends to just above the clouds, aiming for a take-profit objective at 1.08170. If the market’s winds are in our favor, this launch may bring just enough gains for me. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f680.png?v=15.1)  
  
As a precautionary measure, the stop-loss has been set at 1.07500, slightly above the current week's VWAP line (as of post time), ensuring a safe return in case of turbulence.

EUR/USD: new positions  
I've noticed that the rocket's engines have started to cool and the countdown to re-entry may have begun. With a sharp eye and steady hand, I have initiated the first stages of a new sell entry and arranged additional sell limit orders as landing pads. I am prepared to seize further opportunities as the price (may) descends. With these measures in place, it's time to secure and prepare for turbulence as I observe the price movement. The journey carries on, but the trajectory has shifted in my perspective (only). ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f30d.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f6ec.png?v=15.1)

EUR/USD: updated chart before FOMC statements  
  
When analyzing the weekly market data, it's evident that my custom R78 area closely aligns with the traditional weekly pivot point. This is because my weekly pivot point is calculated using the Weekly Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP), which represents the midpoint or 50% level of market activity.  
  
The R78 area, commonly known in pivot trading circles, acts as a pivotal reversal point or an ideal location for setting the Take-Profit for certain pivot-based strategies. This region, calculated based on the midpoint of market activity, can be an advantageous location for identifying potential price reversals or locking in profits for traders who understand its significance. However, again... my weekly pivot point is calculated using the Weekly Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP), which represents the midpoint or 50% level of market activity.

Considering the significant resistance at the R78 area for upward price movements and the nearby traditional weekly pivot point, being at or near it may suggest a potential upward or downward movement. Though, during FOMC it goes both ways, ha ha ha ha! LoLz... But in my biased opinion... Therefore, it is possible that the EUR/USD pair could experience downward pressure during the upcoming FOMC statement. However, it's important to note that certainty in financial markets is rare. While the R78 area suggests potential price decreases, market movements can be unpredictable, similar to a cat chasing a laser pointer.

Blood on the streets... Updated positions  
  
As the current 1-HR candle comes to a close, it seems that 1.08150 could act as a pivotal point separating the bullish and bearish forces in the EUR/USD market. If the price drops below this key level, I plan to sell at higher prices, taking advantage of the opportunity to capitalize on the bearish trend.

The previous 1-hour candle closed below the level of 1.08150. I took this chance to close one sell entry for a modest profit and quickly adjusted my stop loss to protect my gains. As the new candle forms, I am prepared to sell at higher prices if the price starts to rally. Like a hunter in the wild, I'll wait patiently, ready to take advantage of any bullish movements and turn them into profitable opportunities. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f3af.png?v=15.1) Good luck to me! ; )—

Assuming ( ONLY ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/261d-fe0f.png?v=15.1)) that the market presents an opportunity to buy dips... I'm looking to enter at or below the 1.07600 level, which corresponds to this week's pivot point. I calculated this level using my own custom VWAP-based pivot analysis, which marks the market's 50% midpoint. It's not your typical Pivot Point line. While my strategy relies on technical analysis with some consideration of fundamentals, sentiment, and trained intuition, I understand that the markets can be unpredictable.

To secure a small profit and adapt to market conditions, I adjusted my stop loss and removed sell limit orders. My target profit remains fixed at 1.07770. While I’m catching some zzZs before the London opening, I am contemplating the idea of buying on price dips.

Still in my pajamas, but my trading senses are already tingling! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f917.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f4a4.png?v=15.1) As for takes (opinions) given out outside of this thread, I like to think of myself as a Technical Trader Extraordinaire, channeling my inner Chart Whisperer. Fundamentals? Psh, those are for the birds!  
  
My takes are below...

  1. Time horizon: Traders with a short-term focus might find that fundamental factors like economic indicators and central bank policies take too long to play out in the markets. They might instead rely on technical indicators and charts to make quick trading decisions.
  2. Complexity: The global economy is incredibly complex, with various factors influencing exchange rates, from geopolitical tensions to natural disasters.

Remember to keep the big chunk of fundamental analysis for the chirping birds, and follow your technical charts with a sense of humor and a bit of Beatles flair! After all, trading can be a "Hard Day's Night," but with the right mindset and knowledge, you can "Come Together" with the markets like John, Paul, George, and Ringo.  
  
Make sure Yoko doesn't disrupt the band (aka your trading strategy). Stick to your technical prowess and charming wit, and you'll rock the markets like the Fab Four. Stay focused and avoid any distractions that could throw off your groove! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f3b6.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
As the clock ticks towards the London session, I am carefully considering selling at the highs. Will this move land me a solid 'Ticket to Ride'? You don't have to care, but I'm sharing anyway. Meanwhile, I'm also weighing up the potential for buying dips—a tactic I might just 'Let It Be', or who knows, 'Here Comes the Sun' on my buying opportunity. Stay tuned, folks! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f3b5.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f4b0.png?v=15.1)

And now, if this trade doesn't work out, I might need to ‘Come Together’ with a little comfort food ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f366.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f355.png?v=15.1) because ‘I am gonna be sad’ ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f923.png?v=15.1)  
So, my selling highs strategy has a ‘Paperback Writer ’-worthy target of 1.07770 and a protective ‘Penny Lane ’-ish stop loss of 1.08600.

If the price action stays within my identified value area based on quartiles of the volume (tick data) profile, I expect that my target at 1.07770 will be reached.

To minimize potential losses and retain flexibility, I have moved my current selling position's SL at a small profit. This will enable me to reevaluate market conditions and identify new opportunities for high-probability selling entries, thus maximizing potential profits while reducing risk.

In light of recent market changes and after analyzing the situation, I have decided to take a more conservative approach. I closed an active position and canceled my previous pending orders. This strategy will allow me to concentrate on potential opportunities for buying dips when they occur. While I understand that this change might seem premature, I am still dedicated to exercising patience as a fundamental principle of successful trading. As a result, I opened one active order @1.07834 and have placed new pending buy orders in anticipation of favorable market conditions.

This is the end, my friend, my trading journey’s reached its final bend. I'll sleep it out, let my losses run, for this trader’s fight, it’s already won. So don’t stop me now, I’m having such a good time, I’m done trading, and I feel fine ; )—

According to my theoretical analysis and interstellar insights, the price will 'Launch into the Stratosphere' during the trading session (Friday), and I predict it will skyrocket ‘to infinity and beyond’. By the End of the Trading Day (or possibly even by next week), the price will achieve a 'Cosmic Lift-off' reminiscent of the 'Big Bang' itself. Thus, the price has the potential to be truly out-of-this-world ; )—

TP @ 1.07120, hmm... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1) That's a number with 'eyes' on it, like a hawk on the hunt. I’m analyzing the price action and its potential impact on my open positions, like Sherlock Holmes with his magnifying glass. But no matter the outcome, I can sit back, relax, and enjoy the weekend as if I'm on a tropical island, sipping a 'position-free' pina colada! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f3dd-fe0f.png?v=15.1)

As I scrutinize the H1 chart, I’m entranced by these ‘fair value gaps,’ glimmering like forbidden treasure in a trader's fantasy. They’re alluring, but they whisper a siren song of peril, like a mythical sea creature, luring me with its hypnotic promises of wealth, yet threatening to devour me in the treacherous waters of the market.  
  
And that for the next trading week. Have a great weekend!

If the market decides to swing like Muhammad Ali (think float like a butterfly, sting like a bee), my strategy is to sell high and buy low:

  1. Sell: high 1.07250 (min) and 1.07330 (max)  
Profit Target: between 1.06620 - 1.0660  
  

  2. Buy: below 1.0660 (dip)  
Profit Target: between 1.07250 - 1.07500, (or let the trade run up to 1.0800 handle)

It’s like the Float and Sting trading technique—hit it where it hurts, and make it pay! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1). Otherwise, I just made bank ; )—

Within the next three hours, I will be closely monitoring price action at key resistance and support levels. If the price breaks below 1.06970, I will consider a sell entry with TP at 1.0660. If, however, the price breaks above 1.07070, I will look for a potential buy entry with a TP at 1.07390, or depending on market conditions, I may allow the trade to ride up to the 1.08000 handle.

Attracted by the tempting promise of wealth, I ventured into the risky territory of H4 FVG (just above 1.0660). Its enticing nature, similar to a siren's song, calls out to me, but I am aware of the dangers. With caution and bravery, I embarked on the journey, being aware of the potential for both success and failure.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f635-200d-1f4ab.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f30a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Then, by adding insult to injury, I added another short ; )— same TP @ 1.0660 with SL @ 1.07320. I'm on a roll baby!

Hmmm... Blood on the streets later (or my blood)... Then, I will take advantage of the opportunity to sell at a high price when there is excitement in the market. As a smart trader once said, "When fear takes over the market, buy. When excitement takes over the market, sell."  
  
Today, I am taking control of the market while others are excited (or it is just me... too excited)! Ho ho ho ho!  
  
I am witnessing conflicting signals from the EUR in my analysis. On one hand, it seems strong, but on the other hand, it appears vulnerable. This unpredictable behavior has made me more certain about continuing to short, like a detective ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f575-fe0f-200d-2642-fe0f.png?v=15.1) who is convinced that he is on the trail of the true culprit.

Observing my chart below (if you see it only), it appears that my trade has been cannon-balled into a watery grave, thanks to the unexpected intrusion of a Chinese Coast Guard water canon firing inside my area of resistance or my EEZ (Exclusive Economic Zone).  
  
The price must not go beyond @ 1.07250. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f30a.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f4a5.png?v=15.1). Otherwise, I think this will be another day that I will make another bank ; )—

I'm back... After briefly taking a short-term sabbatical from the trading arena (adjusted my SL higher). While my stubbornness was part of my set-and-forget approach, I was rewarded with a little (closed some short entries in profits). Now, my focus returns to the battlefield of bids and asks, ready to strike again, maybe even sooner (@post time my SL moved to profits - leaving one short entry's SL a little above Weekly VWAP).  
  
Meanwhile, I placed a buy limit order at 1.06280 - 1.06500 with a TP of 1.06850 and SL @ 1.05900

While my stubbornness was part of my set-and-forget approach, I was rewarded with a little (closed some short entries in profits). Now, my focus returns to the battlefield of bids and asks, ready to strike again, maybe even sooner (@post time my SL moved to profits - leaving one short entry's SL a little above Weekly VWAP). Meanwhile, I placed a buy limit order at 1.06280 - 1.06500 with a TP of 1.06850 and SL @ 1.05900 {image}

The previous one remaining short trade closed, buy limit orders retracted, and a single buy entry launched with an SL placed at 1.0660. As for the profit target, set @ 1.07050. Also, place one buy-limit order.

EUR/USD: my current positions...  
  
I have a bearish bias for the next 4 hours. After that, I will re-analyze the current price action systematically. Currently, if the 1-hour candle (@post time) closes above 1.07160, it indicates that the Bulls are trying to gain control. If the price breaks down below 1.07060 within the next 4 hours, then the Bears keep on growling to control the Price.  
  
My TP is set for 1.06930, with a defensive SL at 1.07300, ensuring that I’m not caught in the woods ; )—

While the ECB has been raising rates, they’ve expressed caution about going too far, which could be viewed as a dovish stance compared to the Fed. That being said, based on my understanding, I believe the ECB might maintain its current policy for the short-term, which could indeed put some bullish pressure on the EUR/USD pair.  
  
Based on my analysis and bias... I do believe that the EUR/USD pair could have some short-term bullish potential. The ECB’s policy and potential divergence from the Fed’s more aggressive stance could put upward pressure on the EUR. Of course, it’s important to monitor the market closely and adapt your strategy as needed, as things can change quickly. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f4c8.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f4aa.png?v=15.1)

With the EUR/USD trading above the 50-day MA and the 200-day MA still acting as a potential resistance level, it could suggest a bullish bias in the short-term. However, it's important to consider other factors as well, like the overall trend and economic news. It might be a good idea to keep an eye on key levels and the 200-day MA to see if the trend continues or if the pair reverses. Always stay flexible and adaptable! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f4ca.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
In addition, there is strong support around 1.0600 and resistance around 1.0800. A break above or below these levels could indicate a shift in short-term momentum.

Seize the opportunity to buy at discounts around the Weekly VWAP. The bullish bias will be further reinforced if the price breaches the key value area high of 1.07250, which could signal a potential continuation of the uptrend.

New open/pending positions: TP @ 1.07230 and SL @ 1.07650.  
  
Based on my analysis, I expect that the EUR/USD price may initially retrace downwards to fill the gap created by the opening surge, before potentially rebounding to the 1.08000 price level.  
  
Keep in mind that the market is always changing, so it's important to stay flexible and adapt to new information.

The opening gap has been successfully filled, leading me to shift my strategy. I now intend to buy on dips around the 1.07230 level, aiming to take advantage of potential upward momentum in the EUR/USD pair and target the 1.08000 resistance handle.

Based on the current market conditions, it’s possible that the EUR/USD pair could reach the 1.08000 handle before retracing back to 1.06000. Here are a couple of factors that could support this potential scenario:

  1. The recent upward momentum of the pair suggests a possible extension of the bullish trend, potentially driving the price toward the 1.08000 handle (or even up to the 1.08400 handle).
  2. The resistance level at the 1.08000 handle may act as a temporary barrier, leading to a short-term pullback towards the 1.06000 handle before the price continues its upward trend.

Remember, success in trading is a marathon, not a sprint, so keep learning and adapting to the ever-changing markets. Cheers! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

...woke up and no attempt from me to close my positions:  
  
Anyhow, this week, my strategy is to sell at the highs and keep an eye on the price around 1.07000. However, I will remain flexible and adapt my approach to risk management, always prioritizing risk mitigation and avoiding unnecessary risk.

**Operational setup:**  
For a smoother experience when adjusting your chart settings, I recommend temporarily turning off the dynamic MyNET or disabling the Hidden Gap Finder feature. You can also try reducing the start bar parameter value.

Recent market developments have created near-term bearish pressure on the EUR/USD pair. Technically, the pair is nearing a significant resistance level, and the short-term moving averages are trending downward. On the fundamental side, uncertainty surrounding global trade policies and the possibility of economic slowdowns may be strengthening the U.S. dollar, which could further exert pressure on the pair. As always, traders need to stay informed and make decisions based on their risk tolerance and analysis.

It appears that the EUR/USD trend is somewhat bearish in the near term, with the current level approaching a bearish 200 SMA and the 20 SMA gaining downward traction. This is further supported by Trump’s trade policies, which may strengthen the US Dollar Index and put pressure on EUR/USD. However, it’s important to note that market sentiment can shift quickly based on economic data and geopolitical events, so it’s crucial to stay up-to-date on the latest developments.

**v2v dynamic trading system...** _**need for speed updates!**_ — _**well just a bit ; )-**_  
  
• News Events: By default, the on-load behavior when switching between timeframes is turned OFF.  
• dynamic MyNET: When the Weighted Average Price (WAP) indicator type is selected, its status is set to OFF by default during timeframe switches. Also, this tool will automatically toggle OFF if you click or drag the vertical line guides from the main chart used for the VP-R tool regardless of the chosen indicator. The same behavior occurs when you start using the correlation tool.  
  
These updates aim to improve your experience with the system by offering increased flexibility in customizing your default or preferred chart template. When using dynamic MyNET on your chart, I recommend disabling or removing this tool before opening new positions or managing existing ones. This practice ensures a faster and more efficient chart interface.  
  
Although the v2v dynamic trading system contains a comprehensive suite of tools, it is well-structured and designed to be clear and informative once users become familiar with its features. The various components work together harmoniously to provide valuable insights into market trends and dynamics, empowering traders to make well-informed, systematically driven decisions.  
  
While the system may appear complex initially, its organized layout and informative nature allow users to navigate its many tools with ease, making it an effective resource for analyzing and trading the forex market.

Based on the v2v dynamic trading system ; )- assisted technical analysis, I anticipate a potential uptrend in the EUR/USD pair, with the price possibly reaching 1.0450 on or before the end of this trading week.  
  
This projection is based solely on my technical analysis. Please note that my actual trading positions may be subject to change daily during the Asian session as price action develops through the London midday session. I will continue to monitor market conditions and adapt my strategy accordingly.  
  
At the time of this post, other traders sharing a bullish sentiment may also be closely monitoring the 1.03260 level, anticipating a breakthrough to support their long positions.

I am exploring the integration of Order Block features into my v2v dynamic system to identify key areas for institutional order placement. This enhancement aims to align my trading strategies with major market participants.  
  
Order Blocks could complement my current system components, such as volume profile and quantile areas, and improve overall trading performance. They may help me identify high-probability trade setups and critical support and resistance levels, leading to better risk management and more informed entry and exit points.  
  
Incorporating Order Blocks provides a valuable opportunity to adapt to changing market conditions and maintain a competitive edge.

**v2v dynamic trading system...** _**updates!**_  
  
PIVOT FIBS plus:

  1. A new GMT input parameter has been added, enabling users to synchronize the tool with their broker's MT4 server time (see the provided image). This enhancement ensures compatibility with the upcoming Daylight Saving Time (DST) transition, which is set to occur on March 9th, 2025.
  2. ICT's timing ranges, kill zones, and silver bullet have been updated and revised for the most commonly used ranges.

  
Custom Candle & Hidden Gap tool :

  1. The tool now utilizes the GMT input parameter from the PIVOT FIBS plus tool, ensuring seamless integration and accurate time-based analysis across both tools.

**RE-UPLOADED...**  
  
It seems that the original loop in the code was intended to process bars starting from the start of the bar up to the current candle. Changing the loop to start from zero, now includes the start of the bar itself in the calculations, which might cause the custom candle start bar to be drawn inaccurately.  
  
To address this, I adjusted the loop to start from k=1 and checked to ensure that the start of the bar doesn't go below 0.

In the current release, only USD-quoted oil is detected automatically. I will upload the updated v2v Power tool soon. The changes made will allow for the detection of Gold and Silver instruments quoted in USD only as a standard. However, you may need some additional symbols that are hard-coded: XAUEUR, XAUAUD, XAGEUR, and XAGAUD, for extra strength calculations.  
  
For your reference, here is the full list of hard-coded symbols that need to be activated on your MT4 platform's Market Watch.  
  
"EURUSD","GBPUSD","AUDUSD","NZDUSD","**XAUUSD** ","XAUEUR","XAUAUD","**XAGUSD** ","XAGEUR","XAGAUD","EURAUD","GBPAUD","GBPNZD","AUDNZD","EURNZD","USDJPY","GBPJPY","EURJPY","AUDJPY","NZDJPY","CADJPY","CHFJPY","USDCAD","EURCAD","GBPCAD","AUDCAD","NZDCAD","EURGBP","GBPCHF","EURCHF","CADCHF","AUDCHF","NZDCHF","USDCHF","USDNOK","USDCZK","EURNOK","EURCZK","USDMXN","**USOIL.cash** "  
  
The three highlighted symbols above represent the default values for metals and oil, quoted only in USD. For all others, the tool will automatically detect the available values. This functionality for detecting metals will be included in the next release of the tool.

Has anyone looked at currency strength and correlation as tools to manage or execute trade entries?

Recently, I customized my currency strength meter and applied it to analyze various metals quoted in USD, EUR, and AUD. The results have shown that monitoring currency strength and analyzing positive and negative correlations with related symbols can provide valuable insights for traders.  
  
By incorporating currency strength and correlation into your trading strategy, you can enhance your understanding of the market and make better-informed decisions.  
  
Here are some key advantages of using these tools:

  1. Identifying Strong and Weak Currencies: Currency strength analysis helps traders spot trends and potential breakouts, leading to better trade entries and management.
  2. Gauging Correlation: Analyzing correlations between currency pairs and related symbols offers additional insights, helping traders identify potential risks and opportunities.
  3. Reducing Exposure to Market Volatility: By evaluating the strength of the base currency against the quote currency, traders can minimize their exposure to market fluctuations.

**RE-UPLOADED:**  
I have recently resolved some minor issues with the **v2v** **Power** and **Correlation** tool, specifically related to USD-quoted Oil and Metals (Gold and Silver). Please keep in mind that this tool is intended to function as part of the **v2v dynamic trading system** and may not operate effectively as a standalone tool.

**Patience****is a****Virtue**  
  

> Quote
> 
> Disliked
> 
> In a world driven by instant gratification—where desires can be fulfilled with a simple tap or swipe—patience has become a rare and precious virtue. Yet, in the Forex trading arena, patience remains paramount. While many areas of life offer immediate rewards, success in Forex is rooted in the ability to wait, observe, and time one's actions with precision.  
>    
>  Traders who cultivate patience—taking the time to analyze trends and understand market movements—position themselves for remarkable success. Forex trading challenges its practitioners to embrace delayed gratification, pushing them to resist impulsive decisions and to wait for the perfect moment to enter or exit a trade.  
>    
>  In this fast-paced, ever-changing digital landscape, Forex trading serves as a compelling reminder that patience remains a cornerstone of success. It teaches us that great achievements are often born from discipline, resilience, and persistence—the hallmarks of this timeless virtue. —v2v
