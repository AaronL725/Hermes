Sometimes I take positions that take several days or weeks, during which time, quite frankly, I am bored. Now I don't recommend that people trade out of boredom, but I figured I'd try some small lot scalping to test a commonly used scalping system to entertain myself (and hopefully make a few additional pips) while longer-term plays develop and (hopefully) come to fruition.  
  
**__The Basic Method__**  
  
There are a number of variations of this scalping system, but the rules have been basically presented as follows ... .  
  
The chart set up is basically a virtually naked chart with all but a 25 SMA on the 1H. I have read that you can use virtually any time frame for this method, but I am going to stick with the 1H for practical reasons, since you will be looking at the charts for "signal" candles at the top of each hour.  
  
(Certain variations of this system have S/R lines at obvious support/resistance levels where price has shown a tendency to retrace, which I imagine can't hurt with the possible success of the method ... .)  
  
If you have a platform that can tile views of a large number of pairs at the same time, it is recommended that you set your screen up that way so that you can scan multiple pairs for "signal" candles.  
  
Start your screening of possible scalp set-up's for pairs that are trending (i.e., with the 25 SMA moving discernibly up or down) and with consistency of price in relation to the 25 SMA on the 1H and the 4H. If the pair is ranging, consolidating, or there is divergence between the 1H and 4H (i.e., price is above the 25 SMA on one, but below on the other), don't trade that pair.  
  
Also, it appears that it is the preference of many traders to use this system at or near the beginning of sessions, when price movement is likely to be the most pronounced, avoiding, of course, those times when economic data is going to be announced that might affect the trajectory of the pair (a separate variation discussed below).  
  
Once you identify these pairs and the direction of the trend, watch for counter-trend candles to appear. For example, if the pair is trending down as shown by the 1H and 4H charts, look for counter-trend bullish candles to appear. (Some methods use 1, 2, or 3 counter-trend candles; I think the more the merrier, but I also don't want to wait three hours for three counter-trend candles to form ... .)  
  
**_On the close of the next candle that appears in the direction of the trend (that is your "signal" candle)_** , fashion an entry order to trade the pair in the direction of the trend at or below close of that candle (in the case of a short), setting a stop loss 8 pips above that entry, with a TP of 10 pips.  
  
There are variations on this set-up, with the SL being set above the "high" of the signal candle; the TP and SL being managed after entry into the trade and such ... . 8 pips seems like an arbitrary SL to me, but it also sets your risk at a predetermined level; 10 pips is also likely to cut short potential "runners" but then again, you're in and out, have locked in your profit after which you move on, go to sleep, do your business without thinking about those open positions you're running ... . Naturally, if you run into a situation where the position appears to want to run longer than 10 pips, I naturally see no harm in moving your SL to breakeven and then managing the SL as price moves favorably in the direction of the trend.  
  
Unfortunately, I did not see a huge discussion about risk management with this method. One way to look at it is to say that for each microlot I devote to the trade, I am facing an $.08 loss if price moves against my position for each micro lot and a $.10 gain per each microlot if it does not. For example, if I devote 20 micro lots to the trade, then I am facing a potential loss of $16.00 and a potential gain of $20.00. Tweak the lot size in a way that conforms with your risk appetite (or lack thereof). For my part, I am thinking about using a 2 x equity max per scalp, which is not particularly aggressive ... .  
  
Naturally, there are other subjective components to the method that are too numerous to outline here that involve reading what the candles are telling you as to whether buyers are in control, whether sellers are in control, or whether a tug-of-war is occurring. I would naturally recommend boning up on how to read candles, candle patterns, and the like, since that may give you an additional edge with the method, keeping you out of some trades that meet the objective criteria for entry or that give you additional confirmation that your entry is a good one.  
  
  
**__The News Event Variation__**  
  
Okay, so I hate trading the news. Way too wild. Way too fast. And there is the little thing about my not having an approach as to how to trade the news.  
  
Well, here is a scalping approach ... . And it basically ignores any trend a given pair is experiencing at the 1H or 4H, although I imagine if the news results in movement that is in keeping with the prevailing trend that exists at the time, it is likely to be more profound in depth ... .  
  
First, look at the economic calendar for high impact news events. For me, I have a day job that basically starts and ends with the New York session (which is why I call this thread the U.S. Day Job Scalper, since I'll have to resort to scalping primarily in the Asian session). So, I basically can't scalp either the London (sleeping) or the New York (working) sessions, so my main focus will be on scalping Asian session econ news events.  
  
Second, hop on that computer shortly before the announcement, set your chart to the 5 minute time frame, and watch price action as the data is announced.  
  
Third, _**on the close of the first five minute candle after the news announcement**_ : (1) if the 5 minute candle is **_bearish_** , fashion an entry order to short the pair at or slightly below that five minute candle's closing price, with an SL at the open or above the price high for that candle, moving the SL to break even as soon as the opportunity presents itself and then to at least +10 pips when the opportunity presents itself; (2) if the first, post-announcement 5 minute candle is _**bullish**_ , fashion an entry order to buy the pair at or slightly above that five minute candle's closing price, with an SL at the open or below the low for that candle, moving the SL to break even as soon as the opportunity presents itself and then to at least +10 pips when the opportunity presents itself. In both cases, proceed to manage the TP by watching for a "signal" candle or other evidence that shows that price is potentially reversing ... .  
  
As far as lot size is concerned for a news event scalp, I am likely to go lower in size than with the other scalping method described above and the reason is quite simple: when I enter the trade, the size of that first five minute candle may vary dramatically and thus my potential risk may vary dramatically. With news events, price can move particularly quickly, so I won't have a lot of time to dick around with figuring out an ideal lot size based on the size of that first candle. For my part, I am likely only devote 1 x equity to such a trade, since it could potentially involve greater risk and therefore greater loss ... .  
  
I imagine that if the order doesn't execute fairly quickly, you will want to delete the entry order fairly soon, as you naturally don't want to get caught in some kind of nasty retrace. Unfortunately, I don't have any particularly useful guidelines as to when to give up on the entry ... . The one thing you don't want to do is to attempt to chase an entry; if it doesn't execute, delete it and move on to another pair.  
  
* * *  
  
I'll try to post examples as I go along ... . 

Fireworks are fun ... as long as you don't blow your fingers off.

_**_Next Week's Asian Session News Event Scalp Opportunities_**_  
  
So here are next week's Asian session high impact news event scalp opportunities:

For my part, I'm going to be watching for price movement around that NZD Retail Sales announcement and the JPY Prelim GDP.  
  
The AUD Monetary Policy minutes can be a horribly mixed bag, so I might watch price action around that time, but it may just produce gyrations to both sides that are difficult to take advantage of ... . Won't be awake for the RBA Governor's talk, but he is likely to continue in the vein of indicating that the Aussie is overvalued ... .  
  
The BOJ stuff is currently tentative, and it always seems that they never start at a particular time, so those announcements are not worth holding my breath for, since they could occur at virtually any time during the Asian session.  
  
Additionally, that CNY HSBC Flash Manufacturing announcement might move the Aussie one way or another later in the week.

_**MT4 Screen Set-Up**_  
  
So, here's the way I've got the MT4 screen set up. It looks a bit busy, and you probably could cull out of a couple of what I would call the "non-Asian" pairs out of the mix to simplify the thing:

Since I'll be trading the Asian, I imagine my focus with be on AUD/JPY, AUD/NZD, AUD/USD, EUR/AUD, EUR/JPY, EUR/NZD, GBP/AUD, GBP/JPY, GBP/NZD, NZD/JPY, NZD/USD, and USD/JPY.  
  
I also anticipate avoiding trading in either GBP/JPY and GBP/NZD, since these pairs can be quite violent, and it is likely that stops will be easily blown even if the pair is trending in the direction you want on a longer-term basis.  
  
I would also probably recommend having a little cheat sheet handy (mine has a few gaps, which I'll fill in on Sunday) at the beginning of your trading session with the pairs' relationship to the 4H SMA so that you don't have to keep toggling back and forth between the 1H and 4H:

After making sure that my indicators were set up the same on all my charts (25 SMA, 3 Level ZigZag Semaphore Indicator), I rechecked the my spreadsheet and filled in any gaps. Naturally, the 1H column may change between now and the Asian open, but it kind of gives me an idea about which pairs are trending. For instance, virtually every Yen pair is ripping upward; virtually every Cable pair, down:

The Euro pairs appear to be in short-term consolidation or transition, with divergence present in many pairs or, at least a period of indecision as evidenced by the flat aspects on many of the Euro cross 1H's. That being said, I wouldn't necessarily read too much into the Euro crosses being flat or divergent based on the final few hours of Friday's sessions, where many traders are exiting positions in order to lock in profits before the weekend.

_**_Today's Plan (11/16/14)_**_  
  
1\. NZD cross news scalp. The plan is to scalp the NZD retail sales announcement, most likely using NZD/USD. Because there may be volatility associated with the announcement, I plan to stay out of doing non-econ scalps of NZD crosses and to just focus on scalping the announcement. The forecast is for 0.8% versus 1.2% previous for Q/Q Retail sales. If the forecast is correct, we'll see a dip in the Kiwi ... . (The mindset, however, is not to anticipate the move, but rather to just watch the first five minute candle post-announcement and make an appropriate entry at that point, regardless of how the announcement turns out.)  
  
2\. Yen cross news scalp. The Japanese Prelim GDP announcement may make things temporarily hinky for Yen crosses, so -- as with the NZD news scalp, I am going to stay out of Yen crosses for at least this Asian session. The forecast is for 0.5% vs. -1.8% previous Q/Q GDP. Correct forecast = Yen strength, so expect retracements of recent Yen cross rip-up's if that turns out to be the case. Most likely pair to be used: USD/JPY (I have a longer-term short EUR/JPY position, so I'm not going to use that pair for this trade ... .)  
  
If we do get a very positive number (forecast or above), I anticipate managing this trade and not just settling for 10 pips. Yen crosses have ripped up so far in the past couple of weeks that an oversized number could lead to a substantial correction in these pairs. That will involve keeping eyes on the chart for a period of time after the initial entry and moving the SL to breakeven as soon as practicable and then again moving the SL to profit if the trade goes that way ... .  
  
3\. Non-econ scalps. Because of the NZD and JPY announcements, I may keep an eyeball on AUD crosses for possible non-econ scalp opportunities. At this point in time (it is way before the open), I'll focus on scalping the following pairs: AUD/USD long, EUR/AUD short, and GBP/AUD short.  
  
I'll hop back on shortly before the NZD news announcement ... .

Dang ... . Didn't have my clock synchronized with my econ calendar, so missed the boat on the entry which would have been .79145 or so. Could have moved the SL to breakeven or plus 10 at this point or closed it out at the peak. But could've gotten 25 to 30 pips out of that ... . Oh, well ... . At least it didn't cost me anything.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

There has been a "sympathetic" bounce in the Aussie in light of the NZD data, so I'm going to wait a bit on scalping Aussie crosses ... .  
  
This is most apparent in EUR/AUD and GBP/AUD ... .

So, I initiated a buy of AUD at the price at the top of the first red candle, with a SL 8 pips below and a TP of 10 pips above.  
  
We'll see how that works out ... .  
  
Not sure if that was advisable so soon after the opening of the session, but hey ... .

Awesome ... . Don't usually dabble in it, but it will provide a distraction while my longer term plays are working themselves out ... .

May try to take a second dip at the AUD/USD well ... . Price remains above the 25 SMA on both the 1H and 4H, so I will need a bearish candle here or will have to base an entry on the first signal candle that I screwed up the entry on the first time around ... . That would be a long at .87464, SL .87384, TP .87564.

... and then there is the "fingertrap method" of scalping, which is discussed at length here ... . [http://www.dailyfx.com/forex_forum/f...r-trap-strateg](http://www.dailyfx.com/forex_forum/finger-trap-strategy/616653-finger-trap-strateg)  
  
Set-ups for the use of this strategy may be developing in the Yen crosses post-GDP numbers ... .  
  
With the fingertrap, two moving averages are used -- an 8 SMA and a 34 SMA. The set-up you are looking for is for price to be on one side of the 34 for both the 5 min. and 1 H charts and for the pair to be noticeably trending. You take your entries using the 5 min. chart when price touches the 8 SMA in the direction of the trend.  
  
The notion behind this (as with the "signal" candle method above) is that people trading in the direction of the trend are temporarily exhausted, so you are buying on dips (for longs) or bounces (for shorts) as evidenced by price touching the 8 SMA.  
  
Currently, USD/JPY is poised to cross the 34 SMA on the 1H and is below it on the 5 min, so I may take a "fingertrap" short if price touches the 8 SMA on the 5 min.

So, USD/JPY just touched the 8 SMA on the 5 min, so I've shorted it at 116.264. I'll move the SL to BE as soon as price moves +10 pips in my favor ... .  
  
SL currently at 116.50 ... .

Peeled off half position of USD/JPY fingertrap short and will let the remainder run ... . If I get follow-through, great; otherwise, I'll get at least what I've locked in, plus the 10 pips of the SL ... .

So we're beginning to see a desired breakdown below 116 ... . I will consider adding to the position if there is another touch of the 8 SMA and the candles indicate that sellers are in control ... . What I like to see is minimal wicking on the high end of the bearish candles ... . We're showing a bit of wicking on the north side of the bearish candles on the 5 min., implying that buyers are weighing in at some juncture ... .

Obviously some hesitancy to move past 116.00 ... . But we may get another touch of the 8 SMA here shortly ... . Not sure I will go for that at this point ... . Would prefer a breakdown below 116 before adding, since 116 appears to be providing some resistance ... .

Well, any ideas you've got are welcome ... . More eyes on the charts, the merrier! For tonight, I think it's going to be Yen crosses short, though ... .

But now that we moved past 116.00, I may add to the position if price again touches the 8 SMA (since I'm now playing with house money).

Bigger breakdown than I expected ... . But I would expect to see resistance at 115.30, at least according to my 3-Level ZigZag Semaphore indicator (30 min.) ... . Don't know if I'll get to add at another strike of the 8 SMA before hitting the hay ... .

And I think I'm going to leave that trade as it is to run overnight ... . Good SL in place ... .  
  
I considered fingertraps on AUD/USD and NZD/USD (long), but the angle of ascent isn't quite as steep as I'd like to see for a fingertrap, at least on the 5 min. ... . Although there is no strict rule of thumb for the "angle" of ascent or descent, the USD/JPY short is a good example of the type of angle you'd like to see ... . Basically, you want to catch the pair in a rip ... .

May have spoken too soon, might get a touch of the 8 SMA here ... .  
  
Oops ... . Closed out my position accidentally as I was attempting to adjust the SL. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f923.png?v=15.1)

There's not much on tap for tomorrow: AUD Monetary Meeting Minutes ... , so the whole world's your scalping oyster (but I'll avoid AUD crosses for the evening ... .)

**__Aussie Econ Scalp__**  
  
So, we've got Aussie Monetary Policy Minutes in about an hour and half's time, so I thought I would have another go at trading news (last night didn't go spectacularly, although I made up for some of that with a fingertrap USD/JPY short ... .) Hey, what's a demo for but to try out new techniques ... . Quite frankly, I'm not very fond of watching the 5 min., waiting for that candle to close, and then entering. A good deal of the initial impulsive move has evaporated, and -- as we saw with Yen crosses last night, that move can quickly evaporate, leaving you feeling stupid and stopped out ... . Naturally, if there is follow-through in the direction of the original impulsive movement, that's all fine and dandy, but it doesn't always happen that way ... .  
  
In any event, I thought I would try the Donchian Channel breakout method using the channels displayed on the AUD/USD 30 min. chart as guidelines for my entries:  
  

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Basically, I will set an order to go long should price break the top channel, as well as an order to go short should price break the lower. The SL's will be price at the level of the opposite channel, and the SL's will be moved to break even at the earliest possible opportunity and the pender that did not execute will be deleted. Some platforms allow you to place an OCO ("one cancels other") pair of orders for such a scenario, so that if the long executes, the short is deleted, and vice versa.  
  
The way the channels are priced currently may naturally change in the next hour or so (it being a 30 min. chart), but right now the top channel is at about .8743 and the lower at .8692. So the plan is to fashion an entry order to go long if price strikes .8748 (5 pips north of the channel's upper limit) and to short if price strikes .8687 (5 pips south of the channel's lower limit).

__**Non-Econ Scalps**__  
  
I've scrolled through obvious Asian session candidates for scalping, but am not particularly excited about any particular pair. Yen crosses appear to be digesting last night's monkey business, so I'm not sure I want to wade into those unless there is a repeat of last night's breakdown ... .  
  
NZD/USD may be interesting, however, at least for purposes of a fingertrap scalp. The pair has broken through the 1H 8 and 34 SMA's and appears to be poised to head lower. However, I see some resistance below around .7900 and would prefer the pair to move through that level so that I could imaginably see some continuation through to .7840 or so ... . It has been sideways since around the London close. However, I've noticed some sympathetic movement in the Kiwi in response to Aussie data, so we'll have to see what occurs with the pair once the Aussie minutes are announced.  
  
Also, I've been pouring over various charts in connection with what scalping method to use. I see practical drawbacks to the "1H Signal Candle" method described at the outset of this thread and that is, quite frankly, that I've got to wait an hour for a candle to close before setting up an entry order. Lots of good stuff can happen in an hour. For that reason, I'm going to focus on using fingertrap, even if it does yield fewer set-ups than the 1H Signal Candle method. Additionally, I don't want to necessarily settle for 10 pips as a matter of course. I want continuation that has the potential to yield more than 10; if I get ten because I moved my stop loss to break even + 10 pips, that's great, but if I can get more, I'm going to go for it in virtually every case.

On the other hand, EUR/JPY may be ripe for breakdown ... . It has had difficulty moving higher and retracing all of the ground it gave up post GDP figures. However, while price is below the 34 SMA on the 1H (just barely), it is still above it on the 5 min. Worth keeping an eye on, though, if it breaks through the 34 on the 5 min.

Pondering whether the 30 min. channel is too wide ... . Ceiling is + 40 above current price; floor - 20 or so.  
  
The 15 min. Donchian channel ceiling is at .8722; floor -- .8695 (about the same as the 30 min.). That could also be a slight "tell" as to the direction traders think the announcement will push price ... .  
  
Think I'm going to use the 15 min. channels ... .

Lack of impulsive movement post-Monetary Minutes in AUD/USD (which is what I generally look for with econ announcements), so deleting out the entry for the econ news scalp. Worth keeping an eye on for just a straight fingertrap scalp, but would need to break resistance rather convincingly at .8721 for me to consider that.  
  
Taking a break for a bit for din-din ... .

And now AUD/USD is back to pre-Monetary Minutes levels, and NZD/USD is retracing its sympathetic gains.  
  
EUR/JPY may breakdown (eventually), but the temporary concern for a short here is the higher highs on the left. I know it's only a 5 min., so these are -- in the grand scheme of things -- minor blips on the radar ... :

I would prefer a series of lower lows and lower highs ... .  
  
But the pair doesn't currently meet the criteria for a fingertrap short: (1) below the 34 SMA on the 1H; (2) below the 8 and 34 SMA on the 5 min.; (3) visibly trending in the direction of the trade .. .

An hour and 3/4's into the Tokyo, and nothing has panned out or looked promising (from a fingertrap perspective). Oh, well, there's always tomorrow ... .

Well, everything economic on tonight's menu is "tentative" BOJ stuff, so Yen crosses might be frisky (as they have been for the greater part of the day, it seems), so I will steer clear of those unless something dramatic occurs (i.e., continuation through the double tops or total breakdown ... .)  
  
Both USD/JPY and EUR/JPY face arguable double tops, with the former at basically 117 even, the later at about 144.60.  
  
AUD/USD is short-term sideways, which could arguably make for good scalps from extreme turns in the ZigZag, assisted by the PSAR or another indicator:

As you can see on the 1H, the short-term trend is bullish, so I would favor buy scalps.  
  
NZD/USD was making some bullish headway over the last several days, but that appears to have come to a temporary halt in light of negative economic data showing yet another drop in dairy prices, with an arguable double top in place around .7975-ish, which also could be interpreted as a wedge formation, the breakout from which is usually an dramatic affair:

Naturally if price breaks that rising trendline, a good fingertrap set-up might occur ... . However, the pair has yet to make a lower low off of the double top, so it remains to be seen if it's going to continue lower and make a lower low or rebound through previous resistance ... .

With AUD/USD, watch for reaction off the psychological .8700; with NZD/USD, .7910.  
  
With .8700 and AUD/USD, though, the resistance isn't particularly "clean" there; lots of wicking, false breakout's, etc.

NZD/USD right at that .7910 resistance ... . If it breaks through, I will consider a fingertrap short on a touch of the 8 SMA on the 5 min.

With AUD, waiting for a long opportunity around .8700 if the 5 min. candles show buyers taking over + a change in the PSAR indicator (currently showing down).

Ugh. NZD/USD dawdling at resistance. If you happen to be into Camarillas, price is hesitating at the Camarilla S2 (Daily). Price breaking through the S3 Camarilla (currently at .79013) is considered a "breakout" by the proponents of using those particular pivot points for intraday trading.

NZD/USD close to breaking through that Camarilla S3; I'll take a short at this point if price either touches the S2 or the 8 SMA (they're right at the same spot right now).

Sometimes this is like watching paint dry ... .  
  
NZD/USD still dawdling around the Camarilla S3; AUD/USD around the S2.

I was looking for a long opp in AUD/USD, but now it looks like it may breakout lower ... . Resistance at .8700, though.

Will let the remainder ride; SL is at breakeven, so it's a no risk proposition at this point.  
  
I'll check back in later to move the SL (or see if it's stopped out).

Actually, looks to be ripping a bit ... . SL moved to BE + 10 ... . Fun trade. ... But AUD/USD short would have been good too from the looks of it.

Good thread mate but make sure you stick with 1 or 2 ideas and work them. Butterflying all around from idea to idea will lead to nothing working well. I did it for years!

Thanks for the advice. I usually start out with 1-3 ideas for the evening and then narrow it down to one.  
  
NZD/USD short worked out okay this evening.

Overnight the 3rd 3rd of the NZD/USD short stopped out at about +25 pips, which was not bad ... . However, were I to have gotten into the AUD/USD short as well, it would have had better follow through. Oh, well, sometimes you hop on the wrong horse.  
  
Tonight we've got CNY HSBC Flash, which may make AUD a little jumpy depending on how it turns out. The forecast is 50.2 versus 50.4 previous ... .  
  
AUD/USD levels to watch: .860 Psych/Previous Support; .85529/11/6 low of .854 (which is also the 2014 low). The pair broke the 1H rising trendline described yesterday and shaved off about 100 pips. HSBC Flash could give the pair a boost, or could also send it lower to test the 11/6 low and beyond ... . Unfortunately there isn't a whole lot of room between here and a test of .8600. Shortly after HSBC Flash is announced, I will trade the news for continuation or as a news trap ... .  
  
NZD/USD: .7842 (previous support; price currently at this level); .7700 (psych level and arguable double bottom: once on 9/28, the other time on 11/3); yearly low .766. The pair is currently sitting at dabbling around support at .7837 or so ... . As compared to AUD/USD, NZD/USD has more room to fall ... .  
  
Yen crosses are virtually unworkable at this juncture. Many have been in extremely overbought territory for a lengthy period of time, so I hesitate to wade in long (which is direction of the prevailing trend in both EUR/JPY and USD/JPY), as these pairs continue to make higher highs and higher lows ... . My feeling that a breeze of Yen strength could cause them to suddenly collapse ... . Although I will keep an eye on them, I will need to see some kind of break down before daring to short ... .

NZD/USD is beginning to break down post-producer price data ... .  
  
Will consider a short if price touches the 8 SMA on the 5 min., but we're just at the beginning of any breakdown (in my view), and price is hovering at support.

Interesting how NZD/USD price behaves in relation to the Camarilla Pivots (Daily). Dabbled at the Pivot Point after the end of New York (understandable, it's the mean). Then dropped to the S3, tickled the underside of the S2, and now wicking down to the S3 again ... .

Basically same NZD/USD set-up as last night: waited for price to go beyond the Camarilla S3 (indicating possible breakout) and then shorted at the next touch of the 8 SMA. I'm always doubtful of a scenario repeating itself two days in a row ... .  
  
Now, if I hadn't moved my SL in so tight last night, I assume that the 3rd 3rd of my initial entry would still be in play. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f62d.png?v=15.1)

Still some life left in the Kiwi ... . Bounces off the S3 and now between the S2 and S3 ... .  
  
But wouldn't it be nice if this were the beginning of something?:

No high impact news this evening, which could make for somewhat of a schnooze. However, for scalping "teenies," I think a market free of econ news is beneficial -- less to rock any boat you're in.  
  
Last night, I mostly traded GBP/CAD using the one minute chart, which was locked in a nice, narrow (but usable) range for a few hours.  
  
Looking at tonight's charts, I am regretful I have a day job. The breakdown in EUR/JPY I was looking for last night last night materialized early in the London session, resulting in about a 120 pip drop. Naturally, I could not have caught all of that, but even 50 would have been nice. Now, though, it looks to be somewhat sideways, but is having difficulty clearing the .382 Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Point line (around 148.319; coincident with previous minor resistance) and appears to be in short-term consolidation. So, bottom line, I'm still keeping an eye on the pair just in case something there is further breakdown, for example, below the previous day's low of 147.881.  
  
AUD/USD had some serious downward wicking at the New York close (down to .86), so there may be sellers out there to pressure it lower ... .

In actuality, either EUR/CAD or GBP/CAD look rangey and good for range scalps ... . I would prefer to trade things that might arguably have follow-through, but you take what the market gives you.  
  
Here are the two I've got set up right now:

The EUR/CAD short executed ... . So I deleted out the GBP/CAD short (don't want to double up on CAD) ... . We'll see how that turns out. A bit concerned that the range may have narrowed.   
  
EUR/JPY tried to make a run of it above the .382 Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Point line, but has now fallen back below that ... .

EUR/JPY may be making a scalpable run lower here ... . I'm watching for a break of the .236 at 148.178 ... .  
  
There is also resistance at 148 ... . This is one I would want to fingertrap and play for follow-through, so I'm being extra cautious due to the pair's recent bullishness (an understatement).

More interested in a follow-through move by EUR/JPY in any event ... (if it occurs). Price has broken through the .236, but I want to see if it tests it from beneath or not.  
  
Also, looks like it may be consolidating a bit below the .236 Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Point ... .

I'd like to enter short, but only if there is going to be continuation ... . While the breakthrough of that minor intra-day resistance might be helpful, I'd prefer if it just plain broke the daily low and then continue lower.  
  
In that case, I will play it as a "fingertrap" after breaking the daily low, taking entries upon touches of the 5 min. 8 SMA. Strictly speaking, though, it is not yet a really good fingertrap set-up, which starts, really with the 1H chart. You look for price to be below the 34 SMA on the 1H (in the case of a short) and trending and then zoom down to the 5 min. Price should then also be below the 5 min. 34 and 8 SMA's. Enter on touches of the 8 SMA. I guess it's similar to using Bollinger bands ... .

At this point, it's broken that intraday support line and is getting close to 148.00. This is just one of the cases where I want to sell lower ... . I generally don't like breakout plays, but ... so much room to tumble after overbought conditions.

Since I'm now playing with house money, the notion would be to add to the position on subsequent touches of the 8 SMA, assuming there is no support close by and that sellers remain in control as evidenced by the candles. At this point, though, way past my bed time ... .  
  
Happy trading!

A little critique on the EUR/JPY trade that closed out last week ... .  
  
That particular trade turned out well, but the timing of the entry was not ideal and could have been better.  
  
Looking at the chart posted above in the previous posting, you'll notice a couple of things.  
  
Prior to the initial entry, Aso issued a statement regarding the impulsive nature of the Yen's weakness (essentially, his statement was that the Yen had fallen "too far, too fast"), resulting in the impulsive movement below the previous day's low. The initial entry was taken at the break of the -.272 Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Point. The Pivot Point immediately above that is the 0 line, which represents the previous day's low.  
  
In light of the impulsive movement in the pair down to the -.272, a better entry would have awaited the retest and rejection of the previous day's close once and then a second time before entering short. It's not a huge thing pip-wise, but it's a way to reassure yourself that traders have rejected buying the pair at that level. From a candlestick pattern standpoint, a cup and handle formation is arguably present after the first post-Aso bounce, test of the previous day's close, and subsequent dip. This is usually a bullish continuation pattern that, in this case, only shows rejection after a subsequent break of the cup's "lip."  
  
Additionally, I think I needed to label the trade in the back of my mind as a breakout and a reversal. Breakouts and reversals can be particularly profitable, but also quite dangerous. Breakouts can suffer from a lack of follow-through (which I why I move the SL to BE as soon as the pair moves past +20 pips) and reversals aren't always in the cards, especially when -- like EUR/JPY or USD/JPY, the pairs have been so bullish for so long. In this particular case, though, I considered the fact that the pair had retraced in the prior day's New York session, leading me to believe that the pair could experience further weakness, so it wasn't as though it was just starting an intraday reversal at the juncture in time at which I entered the trade.  
  
Thirdly, I was playing this particular trade as a "fingertrap". I've got Heikin-Ashi candles on this chart, which is sort of an attempt to eliminate some of the visual clutter associated with changes in trend. However, when doing "fingertrap" or, I would think, Bollinger bands, you will want to have just raw red/blue candles; Heikin-Ashi averages prices per bar and may not fully tell you whether buyers or sellers are in control at a particular juncture in the pair's trajectory to make an informed decision as to whether to add to the position upon a bounce/dip, which you usually want to do in a fingertrap situation ... .  
  
Fourthly, I probably could have left the last third to run and removed the TP from the set-up. My stop was already at BE or BE + 10 pips (making it a risk-free proposition), and I'd already taken some meat off the table at that point. The notion would be to move the SL down as the trade progresses in your favor to the next nearest swing high (swing low in the case of a long) ... . Unfortunately, I had to get some shut-eye at the point at which I moved the SL to BE or BE + 10 and neglected to consider removing the TP. I could have arguably still been in the trade (20-20 hindsight, naturally ... .).

My approach today is going to be somewhat different ... .  
  
To keep things simple, I am only going to focus on three pairs: AUD/USD, NZD/USD, and EUR/JPY. (How folks scan 17 charts at once is beyond me ... , but kudos to you for being able to multi-task like that ... .)  
  
Secondly, I am going to be looking at breaks of the previous day's highs/lows for rejection or breakout. If a weekly high/low or other obvious resistance is nearby (EUR/JPY, for example, is hovering just south of psychological 146.00), I'll consider that, too.  
  
See you in a couple hours from now, at which time I'll post levels to watch ... . I naturally want to see where prices open in relation to Friday's high/low's and last week's high/low's ... .

At the start of the Asian session, NZD/USD and AUD/USD are hovering near the Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Point, while EUR/JPY is hovering at Friday's low.  
  
I'll be looking to trade EUR/JPY either on a break below Friday's low or bounce off of it. Too early to tell what's up with NU and AU.

If you go short on EUR/JPY at some juncture, last week's low is not far below at 144.81-ish. A break below that could result in some good pippage ... .

Although it's early in the session, I'm gravitating toward Yen crosses for plays. In addition to EUR/JPY, the widow maker (GBP/JPY) may be of interest on a break of 184.00 ... .

Very quiet session, most likely due to Japanese bank holiday, so EUR/JPY locked in a somewhat narrow range.  
  
AUD/USD has made some positive movement upward, tested the underside of the .764 line, was rejected, tested it again, and then eventually broke through and tested the psych level at .8700.

Well, I could have left it there for the evening, but was watching charts on my iPad and saw that something interesting might be happening with EUR/JPY and/or USD/JPY -- some retracement of late last week's bearish movement.  
  
For EUR/JPY, I am now watching the 146.50 level, which provided some brief resistance back on 11/16, and would be where I would consider shifting long if that level is broken since this would be where there would be an 8/34 MA cross ... . This could also be where a news trap would potentially occur, since this is about the level the pair was at the pre-Draghi speech and the level at which shorts that took advantage of that movement would be squeezed and/or stopped out.

As far as a EUR/JPY short set-up is concerned, there is divergence between the 1H and the 5 min, with price being below the 34 on the 1H, but above that on the 5 min., so it is not yet "ripe" for a short (which was frankly the set-up I was looking for when I started out this evening -- continuation of Friday's downturn ... ).

Also, while the PSAR on the 5 min. indicates that the pair might be "rolling over," this is all likelihood just a minor pullback. Compare the number of green/bullish PSAR dots since price struck and bounced off Friday's low versus the number of red/bearish dots:

146.20 new session high ... . Not sure that this level is of any particular significance, although I do see a ZigZag low (support, now resistance) at this level back on 11/21 on the 5 min.

So hating divergent charts for EUR/JPY on the 5 min./1H time frames.  
  
If there is bullish continuation, convergence would occur around 146.52 (that's just me eyeballing where the 34 MA is right now and where a cross of the 8 and 34 might occur) for me to consider long.  
  
Bearish convergence is closer on the 5 min. -- around 146.10, but it doesn't appear we're headed that way short-term.

Retracing from session highs.  
  
Will consider a short on 8/34 MA cross below current price at 146.14-ish.  
  
If I were long (and in the money), though, we're getting a nice series of bull flags/8 MA touches on the 5 min. where you could arguably add to your winning long position ... . ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

A dip below that swing low at 146.10 will also be helpful ... . As well as a large chocolate shake ... . Thanks. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Well, I was up way too late last night watching that ill-fated EUR/JPY short ... .  
  
Tonight, I am going to focus on scalping teenies in EUR/CAD and GBP/CAD, assuming I can get ranges that can be worked with in those pairs. Right now, the range is too tight to be usable for 5 or so pips due to spread, but this naturally may change as the session wears on ... .

Here's the GBP/CAD 1 Min. Chart:

I'm using Trading Station and am displaying **_bid_** prices as the basis for the chart. In setting up the chart for sells, I switch to **_ask_** prices and draw the lower end of the range with a horizontal line (if you're planning on doing buys, draw a similar line for the range ceiling).  
  
What I'd like to see is a 5 pip or so range between which price oscillates and of which I can arguably take advantage, selling at the high end of the range and exiting at the bottom (shown by the gray horizontal line).

Here's is the 1 Min. GBP/CAD _**Ask Price**_ based chart:

You can see that on these small time frames, the Bid Price chart varies substantially from the Ask Price chart. If you are scalping teenies, it is important to know where the Ask price floor is (where you would exit shorts and/or enter longs) and where the Bid price ceiling is (where you would exit longs and/or enter shorts).

Additionally, it may be necessary to redraw the ceiling/floor as the session progression, the range narrows or widens and the like. Right now I've got them drawn based upon the minutes immediately following the New York close when prices jumped around a bit ... . They are likely to settle and narrow later.

Right now the range is between 1.77259 and 1.77203. Not a huge range to work with, but if you trade it dynamically, it's kind of fun ... . Just don't get caught when and if it breaks out, because then you'll have to clean up that mess ... .

I notice that GBP/CAD took quite a dive last night after that last scalp I had from the high of the range, so I'm glad I didn't enter another scalp long after my last short. Generally what I like to do is scalp in the direction of the larger time frame trend (in this case, lower). You're less likely to get caught ... . Naturally if you're trading dynamically and do get caught, you will want to bail out of scalp immediately ... .  
  
In any event, the other scalp I set up last night before I had to go was a EUR/JPY short grid. The notion was to catch downward movement of EUR/JPY in the event that it rejected the previous day's high. If it moved through the high, the grid would not be hit (that's the notion anyways). The set-up turned out to be quite productive, but I caught two danglers at 146.40 (TP 146.30) and 146.30 (146.20) which I will have to deal with later:

GBP/CAD (and EUR/CAD) never did find neat true ranges to use ... . And I missed the long bus ... . But there is always the short bus. For GBP/CAD, there is a 8/34 EMA cross in the making on the 1 min. (I switched to EMA over SMA; seems the exponential is a little bit more sensitive), but this would involve a short-term reversal from the run-up from 1.76771 ... . May be worth a few pips ... .

It looks a bit busy, and you probably could cull out of a couple of what I would call the "non-Asian" pairs out of the mix to simplify the thing: {image} Since I'll be trading the Asian, I imagine my focus with be on AUD/JPY, AUD/NZD, AUD/USD, EUR/AUD, EUR/JPY, EUR/NZD, GBP/AUD, GBP/JPY, GBP/NZD, NZD/JPY, NZD/USD, and USD/JPY. I also anticipate avoiding trading in either GBP/JPY and GBP/NZD, since these pairs can be quite violent, and it is likely that stops will be easily blown...

Awe ... (wait for it) ... some. I think it's better to have a smaller number of screens; that looks like it's just about perfect ... .  
  
Gets me thinking about slapping on some indicators myself. I used to use Slow Stochastic and the Awesome Oscillator, but they tended to squeeze the chart (I thought) too much.

Also, if you've got any scalping methodologies, feel free to share them here. I confess that I sometimes feel that I frankly don't know what the hell I'm doing on the smaller time frames. I'm used to more overarching themes that are obvious on 1H and 4H. I know everyone says that scalping is really not that much different; you're looking at the same candlesticks, support and resistance, and any moving averages and indicators that will assist you in making your trade decisions. What gets me kind of turned about is the fact that you may be trading on a 5 min. chart in a way that totally contradicts what's occurring on a more macro level. For instance, I just can't tweak my psyche to go EUR/USD long short-term because I've got EUR/USD short on my mind for longer-term set-ups.  
  
I've also read virtually tons of variations on how different folks scalp using moving averages (like the "fingertrap"), indicators, "signal" candles, Camarilla pivot points; it's downright maddening ... . Maddening, I say! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f624.png?v=15.1)  
  
I like "fingertrap," but it's really only good for momentum-based movement ... . Trading ranges (if you can find them) in quiet markets is great, especially if you can do so dynamically (both ways) ... .

Please be aware of the fact that scalpers are subject to **A LOT** of unanticipated moves... that will be determined according to your broker.

I have had several (understatement) WTF moments on the smaller time frames ... . My best explanation for these moves is that certain folks want certain candles to close in a certain way at certain times. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)   
  
I generally try to do the entries and exits manually. Unless my broker can see my hand hovering over the mouse ... .

Tonight I'm basically going to keep an eye on GBP/JPY ... . It has come off highs of 186.10-ish earlier today and may be poised for a move lower, with the 1H 8/34 EMA's on the verge of cross over. The cross has already occurred on the 5 min., but I would be looking for follow-through down to 185.00, so I want to be patient and not jump in here if downward movement is going to be of particularly short duration. Currently the angle of descent from 186.10 to current levels is not the kind I'd like to see in a momentum-based play; steeper is better ... .

Just as an example of the kind of angle you're looking for, look at the blue rectangular area highlighting an uptrend in GBP/JPY:

In particular, notice the separation between the EMA's ... . That's the kind of momentum you want to have for a fingertrap set-up. Unfortunately, if you look at the downtrend leading up to current price, you'll notice how close the EMA's are. There is downward movement, yes, but there isn't a great deal of momentum behind it.

On the 1H, we're getting a nice little rising wedge with repeated tests of 186.00:

... So it might be worth a few pips just to play a bounce off 186.00 ... . The alternative is to potentially wait for either (1) a 8/34 EMA cross on the 1H or (2) a break of the rising trendline at 185.00-ish. Me personally, I would favor a retrace off of 186.00 or the 1H EMA cross; if you wait for the break of 185.00, most of the move may already have played out .... .

First third off at +10 pips and SL moved to BE:

And as I was posting this, stopped out the remainder at BE. (Probably moved it in way too close, but didn't like the lack of follow-through through that little swing low at 185.48 or so).  
  
May attempt a second entry upon a touch of the 8 EMA if there is continuation. Looking awfully choppy right now.

GJ (5 Min.): The downward angle of the 8 EMA has flattened and the separation between the 8 and 34 EMA narrowed, spelling, at the very least, indecision as to direction. There seems to be an awful lot of dawdling around the .618 Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Point.

GJ: It is entirely possible that we will get an 8/34 EMA cross on the 5 min. here shortly, which might make a long enticing. However, the last swing high is quite close at 185.82-ish. That being said, a long would be consistent with where price is in relation to the 34 EMA on 1H (above).  
  
On the flip side of the coin, I would consider another short if price breaks below that swing low at 185.468 ... . It otherwise appears pretty indecisive here. Back in a few.

GJ: Had a little fleeting touch of the 5 min. 8 EMA which I didn't manage to enter on. That could be a good thing. Looks to be dawdling a bit again.

GJ Short: Entered at 185.377/SL at 185.845. Same deal as before: ideally, move SL to BE at +20 pips. Peel off positions as position moves into profit. Consider adding positions upon subsequent touches of the 5 Min. 8 EMA assuming continuation.

GJ Short: At + 14 pips, moving SL on last third to BE. At this point, I am playing with house money, so I could add upon touches of the 8 EMA once, I think, I get past 20 pips. Unfortunately, we've got the 185 psych level coming up as well as the daily low at 184.78-ish, so I don't know how productive any additions might be.

GJ Short: Last third of short stopped out shortly after I logged out for +1 pip.  
  
The pair is still worth keeping an eye on for scalps with potential for follow through. Here are some levels to keep in mind (which are based on the Daily and Weekly Fib Retracement Pivot Points):

Drilling down to the 5 min., you can also see that the pair respects (to a certain degree) Daily Fib levels, presenting S/R at these levels:

Currently, for example, the pair is meeting resistance at the .236 line. It is not particularly clean (nature of the beast), but it is not breaking meaningfully below that level. Naturally, it could have more to do with the psych level at 185.00 ... . In any event, I would be looking for a breakout should 185.00 give way meaningfully ... . Right now, basically sideways ... .

I generally give less credence to short-term trendlines like this, but price seems to be respecting it nevertheless, and the three retests of 186.10-ish appear to have temporarily capped price.  
  
Medium impact data later in the day (CPI, etc.) may provide an impetus one way or the other ... .

GJ: Shorter time frame (5 Min.): a falling wedge, the floor of which is around 185 ... :

As of right now, I have the set-up I want for a short with continuation on the 1H (price below the 34 EMA; quite frankly, though, the 8/34 EMA cross on 1H appears to be in its "infancy"). On the 5 Min., however, I am looking for price below the 5 Min. 8 EMA, along with a somewhat steep downward angle (I don't have a particular angle in mind, but I think that everyone knows a rip when they see it).   
  
Also, because short-term resistance is nearby at 185, I'm looking for a break of that level, since the pair's downward movement is being stalled at that point.  
  
That being said, some caution is in order leading up to the JPY data. If it happens to be a giant stink bomb, I could naturally see a retest of 186+, in which case I'd have to change my whole outlook on things. Yen crosses have been on bullish tears since mid-October, but have paused their ascent in the past few days. A tear higher would just be bullish continuation of the trend that has been in place since mid-October, so I need to be ready to flip my approach to a long if that scenario presents itself or await another short set-up.   
  
At this particular price level, however, I would prefer a short set-up due to the amount of air below, and the fact that I consider Yen weakness as overdone. Unfortunately, a movement's being "overdone" is not an actionable trade, although there is some RSI/Slow Stochastic indications that show that the pair is may still be overbought -- although not extremely so -- on the daily (RSI at 65.83; Slow Stochastic bumping along the 80 line).

EJ: EUR/JPY presents a whole different show as compared to GJ. It has been narrowly range-bound for several days between basically 147.50 and 146.40:

Here, I'd be looking for a meaningful break of either of these levels post JPY data. If it breaks 147.50, I would be looking for bullish continuation of the trend that has been in place since the end of October with a near-term TP of 149.00. A break below 146.40 could spell a significant correction for the pair; near-term TP's at 145.60 and 142.25.

UJ: The UJ chart presents a fairly clean breakout short set-up, but longs ... eh ... not so much.  
  
On the 1H, there appears to be a fairly clean floor that the pair is having trouble violating around the Weekly Fib Retracement .5 Pivot Point at 117.20, so I would look for a breakout through this level to go short:

With a long, the ceiling is somewhat dirty, so you may have to use other tools to determine when and if to go long. A psych level is at 118.00, but this a mere 20 pips above current price; the next swing high is around 118.50; a break of 119.00 would naturally be significant, but it is possible that most of the move could be over by then (mere speculation).

Out of the three pairs, EUR/JPY offers clean plays both long and short with USD/JPY and GBP/JPY offering the cleanest plays if price breaks down. Since I am in a longer term EUR/JPY short, I am going to be focusing primarily on either UJ, GJ, or both for good short plays if they present themselves. Because I am in EUR/JPY short, I may also use a UJ long as a hedge against my EUR/JPY short position in the event the Yen weakens even more post-data.

Yen Crosses: JPY data kind of mixed bag. Market reaction somewhat muted so far ... .

Yen crosses: May now be looking at bullish continuation of patterns in place since mid to late October.  
  
GJ: Possible long on break of 185.70-ish, but the reward doesn't look that enticing -- 186-ish.

Yen crosses: Looking like bullish continuation from where I'm sitting. Unfortunately, the recent highs are quite near overhead, which diminishes the likelihood of follow-through. To go GJ long here, for example, with the recent highs at 186.10 doesn't really get my motor running ... .  
  
EJ and UJ, however, have longer to go to recent highs, making them more attractive long.

Yen crosses: I swear these pairs are just teasing me ... . First I think my set-up for GJ short might be coming to fruition, and then bullish continuation appears. Now that bullish momentum appears to be petering out. Well, you can't lose any money if you don't enter a trade and you shouldn't enter a trade if your set-up isn't there ... .

GJ Short: Um, ... not. Looking like a test of 186.00 right around the corner.

GJ Short: Hmmm. Never did see a retest of 186.00 ... . I'll still be waiting for a good short opportunity come next week once full liquidity returns to the market ... . It basically waffled around all night long. Thank goodness it's Friday ... . Have a happy weekend everyone!

Yen Crosses: If last week's postings are any indication, I've got a thing for Yen crosses, and I continue to watch EUR/JPY, USD/JPY, and GBP/JPY with interest because of the substantial run-up they have taken in the last two-four weeks for their potential to correct substantially lower. But that has not come to pass and, in fact, GJ is testing 186.00 as I write this post, which is not the set-up I was looking for. EJ is testing 148, and UJ is knocking on the door of 119. They certainly don't look like short set-up's to any one but those with a "gut feeling" that they've topped out. (Truth be told, I'm EJ short at 146.350/TP 145.580, so yes, I am eating some crow here). That being said, I hesitate to enter long here, too, since these little lines in the sand (186 for GJ, 148 for EJ, and 119 for UJ) are at least short-term barriers to movement and are likely to present an obstacle to short-term reward.  
  
But I am a fairly patient guy ... . I'm fine with settling with 10 pips, but the set-ups I want to see are those with potential for follow-through during which you can lock in the 10 pips by peeling off a portion of your position and then move on (hopefully) with deeper movement into the trend. With fingertrap, you're looking for price to be on one side of the 34 EMA on both the 1H and 5 min. charts and for some fairly significant momentum to be in place as evidenced by the angle of ascent or descent the pair is taking (a/k/a "the rip"). For the above-mentioned Yen crosses, I am looking for short set-ups meeting these criteria ... . But it looks like I've got some waiting to do.  
  
Naturally, I could keep my eyeballs on the chart all night long waiting for that 1H 8/34 EMA cross, but I think it suffices to check in on the charts at the top of the hour when the 1H candle closes to see how those EMA's are making out or to set up an alert that will tell you when that occurs.

Yen Crosses: GJ is testing 118+, EUR/JPY continues to do its rangey dance, and USD/JPY ... well, out of all three pairs, I would think that this appears to be the most amenable to a break lower (which is what I've been looking for for nearly a week ... ). But check out the GJ chart ... . Talk about whipsaw ... .  
  
AUD/USD: There is a bit of AUD news this evening, the most important of which is the rate decision. The forecast is for the RBA to hold rates steady ... . Right now, AUD/USD to dabbling around the pivot point with housing data coming in about half an hour which may provide some movement in AUD crosses that is scalp worthy.

GJ: Retest of daily high within 5 pips. Naturally want to see how price reacts off that level (Daily Fib Retracement "1" Pivot Point). If it breaks through and closes above on the 5 min., I may consider a fingertrap long upon touches of the 5 min. 8 EMA. However, I just can't envisage much follow-through when we're at several months' highs here.

GJ: But on the Monthly scale, we're literally right at the .50 Fib line (182.88) from the 7/07 to the 9/11 low ... . And the bearish trend from 9/11 low is quite protracted. Additionally, 200 is not out of the question, which is right around the .618 ... .

Yen crosses (EJ/UJ/GJ): Continue to test highs/remain bullish, particularly UJ/GJ. UJ currently testing previous day's high. EJ tested previous day's high on prior hourly candle, but flatter trajectory than UJ. GJ has broken previous day's high.  
  
AUD: AU currently testing previous day's low. Ran entire range from previous day's high to previous day's low since last New York close, which would have made for a nice Pivot Point-based short trade .. . Aussie GDP up later, which may provide modest pop if numbers in line with forecast.  
  
EU: Near test of previous day's lows.  
  
GU: I don't generally scalp this pair, but we have a fairly good rip to the downside that would make for a fingertrap (MA cross/good separation between MA's/8 EMA touch):

NU: Choppy and somewhat rangebound for quite a period of time, although there is a slight downward trajectory on larger time frames since the beginning of October. This could make for nice scalps off of obvious S/R or Pivot Points of significance.

NU: Ripping lower now. May consider a short on a touch of the 8 EMA, but probably missed a good entry north of here while I was dawdling with other crap. Not a pair I generally scalp, but a rip's a rip.

NU: Would like to see continuation through that daily low for a short, but fully expecting a bounce there. If it doesn't continue through the low, I'll stand aside for now. Pair's been rangey, and I'd prefer a short higher up if it's not going to rip lower.

NU Short: Eventually took out the last third at 10+ pips on my second entry. However, between the ill-fated first entry and the better second -- basically a wash:

AU Short: Well, Aussie's all the talk of the town this evening with disappointing GDP numbers. What I'm looking for now is a retrace to the previous day's low (.8433-ish) before considering a short.

EU Short: So, I've already got a EUR/USD short in place at 1.24566 with a SL at 1.23801. If the Euro rips lower, I'll add to that position by fingertrap in the hours following the ECB press conf (since I'm now playing with house money). Naturally if things go the other way, I'll probably be stopped out (got about 60 pips of play between current price and the stop).  
  
Basically, the pair's been chopping its way between the .236 Daily Fib Retracement and yesterday's low of around 1.23 even.  
  
And ... they're ... off!

EU Short: What I'm basically looking for on the 5 min. is a cross of the 8 and 34 EMA's, after which I'll add upon touches of the 8 EMA if we get some mo to the downside.  
  
However, right now it's looking like we've got buyers, so I may stop out or close the short and then scalp to the long side on an extremely short-term basis.

EU 5 Min.: I naturally could have made some pips there, but what I'm looking for is a set-up with follow-through. I want to see higher highs and higher lows to go long and lower highs and lower lows to go short. To me, the failure to hold above yesterday's close is telling, but I don't want to dive in short yet, as there appear to be buyers out there at various levels. For instance, a few buyers waded in at the Pivot Point, driving price back up to the .764 ... .

Thanks for the recommendation; I'll have a gander at the chart.  
  
A lot of those Swissie crosses use to give a lot of good rangey action that's good for scalping in quiet markets; recently I think I've kind of ignored them because of all the news surrounding the SNB's intervention in the EUR/CHF floor and such ... .  
  
But worth another look ... .

Also, helps to have two accounts: one for scalping; one for longer-term stuff (working at getting that in place at the beginning of the year). I was getting in and out of GBP/CAD for 4-8 pips, but now that I've got a longer-term set-up in my one account for that, it kind of blocks it out from scalping in the single account. Naturally, if you're not subject to FIFO, you can continue to scalp it without having two accounts ... . Stupid FIFO.

USD/JPY: Watch for a break of the swing low at 118.75 (I'm not counting that impulsive wick down to last week's low as part of that swing). There could be a number of stops located there in light of the bounce that could be taken out very shortly.

UJ: I read an article that this (119) would be a good level at which to buy ... . To me, the 1H chart says "lower highs" and "lower lows" since the 121.75+ high.   
  
However, we've got that wick down to the previous week's low at around 118.00 even, which means that buyers were there (at least yesterday). But given the retracement to around 119.80+, my guess is that those buyers that drove price back up from 118.00 now have placed BE stops either at that level or "in profit" stops at that 118.75 swing low (minus the wick). Blow those and more impulsive downward movement ... .

I'd have to set up a separate TE just for scalping, which I don't do enough of to properly test. Just one of things I do from time to time if I have free time during the early Asian ... . But the plan at the beginning of the year is to set up one account just for scalping and another account for the other method that the demo is based on now, so I'll eventually get around to it, but I'm not sure how much of a "test" it'll be ... .  
  
It's kind of unfortunate that I couldn't stay up after that last UJ short scalp ... . Looks like we got the follow-through I was waiting for ... . Oh, well, can't be on 24-7.  
  
But UJ's right at last week's low, so could be an interesting session for that pair ... .

Let me qualify that somewhat ... . Will add assuming that I am at least 20 pips in the green ... . Doesn't make sense to add positions any closer to your entry ... .

Which is why I always peel off some as it moves lower. Then your efforts aren't for nothing. That being said, I won't pass on 45 pips worth of movement in that short period of time. Hardly ever happens that I come home from work and find a pair breaking a previous day's low, with the 5 min. 8 and 34 EMA's headed in the right direction and at a good angle ... . Usually it's a long waiting game.  
  
And the darn thing is right back at yesterday's low ... . Apparently not ready to give up that level yet. For me, though, dinner time ... . Good luck, everyone.

But here's the basic set up for "fingertrap" trend scalping: [http://www.dailyfx.com/forex/educati..._in_Forex.html](http://www.dailyfx.com/forex/education/trading_tips/daily_trading_lesson/2012/03/26/Short_Term_Momentum_Scalping_in_Forex.html)  
  
It's a bit more interesting that merely trading tight ranges (don't get me wrong; I'm totally fine with that), but I think it's probably a little better (or quite a bit better) during the London session and the London/New York overlap, since there is more likely to be follow-through on movement.   
  
Additionally, while I'm fine with capturing a bunch of 5-8 pip range plays, I'd rather enter a position that at least has the promise of more than 10 pips.  
  
But the underpinnings of it are price action and a good grasp of S/R fundamentals, as this will guide you as to when a good entry is shaping up.

Yen Crosses: I'm looking at basically doing a repeat of last night with a Yen cross, most likely EJ or GJ. We are getting close to a cross of the 8 and 34 EMA's on the 1H for both EJ and GJ, which is generally the set-up you want to even begin to consider a fingertrap (you want to see a cross on the 1H first and then move down to the 5 min. and trade in the direction of the 1H EMA cross ... .). However, I might not have much room to play with between where the cross occurs and support.  
  
Last night's UJ short's weren't really good fingertrap set-up's in the sense that the 8/34 EMA cross had occurred a good deal above where I was getting in. The notion I was using there was that because we were seeing a break of (I think, if I remember correctly) the previous day's or week's low, there might be continuation lower. In that sense, it was basically a breakout play (that got a few pips in, but basically no continuation). Naturally, were I to have been able to get in at the 1H 8/34 EMA cross above ... score!!!! (But I was at my day job ... .).  
  
Additionally, we had a bull cross of the 8/34 after a bounce off support (asleep at that time, unfortunately) which also could have been taken advantage of.   
  
In any event, these pairs aren't there yet, so I will recheck them at the top of the next hour ... .

Last Asian Session's EJ Short Play: Well, I figured that I had stopped out, as I was relegated to watching the chart on my iPad for several hours using charting software other than my broker's. Turns out that I virtually came within less than a pip of my SL and that, in the end, I made a couple of additions that turned out to be productive, with price eventually breaking below my first entry around the beginning of the London session, but just barely:

Looking at the chart now, it looks like it was a wise decision to bail out around last week's low, since it popped back up a good 95 pips after striking that level, making me think that it could have made for a fantastic dynamic trade. Look at how price responds to certain Fib lines:

The lower Fib line (indicated by the purple arrow) is the Weekly Fib Retracement "0" Pivot Point, which represents the previous week's low, so obviously it's a level that is inherently of possible value from a scalping perspective. It also happens to be coincident with the 147.00 psych level, so it's even nicer that way ... . The higher level indicated by the red arrow is the .382 Weekly Fib Retracement Pivot Point.  
  
And ... when I overlay the Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Points over the Weekly, I also see the potential reason why price appears to be bouncing off the Weekly .382 ... . Well, it's not really; it's retracing off the previous day's high (represented by the 1.0 line). Conversely, price isn't really bouncing off the Daily .382, it's bouncing off the Weekly "0" line or previous week's low:

Hate that my platform deletes out the trade history from the chart at the end of each trading day. Swear I should have stopped out on that EJ short trade ... . Naturally concerning if your SL doesn't execute; on the other hand, it could also be that the charting software I was looking at was inaccurate in terms of showing the ask price (a lot of charting software averages the bid and ask, which isn't helpful when you're playing with tenths of pips) or, given my fatigue level at that time of night, entirely possible that I jotted down the wrong SL on the post-it before moving over to watch on my iPad, or simply didn't place the SL at the swing high I thought I placed it at. That is like the third time I've messed up a trade this month because I didn't double check before logging off ... . Fortunately it worked in my favor this time; the last couple of times, eh, not so much ... .   
  
Another couple of lessons in that: (1) don't log off when a scalp is in play and you haven't been able to get a BE SL in place; and (2) don't try to make dinner plans if you're going to be scalping and haven't been able to get a BE SL in place before you go ... .

EJ Short: Now comes the least fun part ... . Waiting ... . CCI is at 132.48 on the 5 min. and pointed lower, but price is still above the 8 and 34 EMA's, which have now crossed bullish. May have to dollar cost average out of the net position, which I am not fond of doing ... . So for now I'm waiting for price to cross back below the 34 EMA which is at 147.42 or the CCI crosses the 100 line (preferably both).

EJ Short: Fewer than 10 pips away from BE for the net position. May consider removing limit at (now) 147.422 should it appear to want to rip. But it's dawdled between 147.7 even and this level for a good while now, so maybe I shouldn't tempt fate and take it at +10 pips. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

The first series was a good set of entries, placement of BE SL's, and peeling off of positions as the trend moved in my favor.  
  
The second should have switched to long on the bullish cross of the 8 and 34 EMA; I was trading counter-trend the whole time, so the approach to save the trade was to dollar cost average, but the entries were poor for that method. For that method to work, it is best to wait for the trend to exhaust (a bearish 8/34 EMA cross would have been the clue), and then to add positions at that point upon touches of the descending 8 EMA, assuming that there appears to be a good angle to the descent. I added a couple positions in the up trend after initial entry and before the bearish EMA cross and then a few more during a flat consolidation area, which is not a good area to add since price can move up or down from these areas ... .  
  
Moreover, I also missed out on a good deal of pippage on the uptrend ... .  
  
Staring at the chart for the past several hours, however, makes me think that just entering and exiting on the 8/34 EMA crosses on the 5 min. chart might be productive ... . Something to think about going forward ... . Or entering on the cross, bailing at a change in heikin-ashi color ... .

Pretty quiet market ... . Yen crosses narrowly rangebound and basically flat.  
  
The only pair that looks interesting might be EUR/NZD ... . On the hourly, it looks bullish, so even though on the 5 min. it put in a bearish 8/34 EMA cross a short while ago, I would look to go long on a bullish cross of the 8/34 with an extremely modest TP (like, at 1.61 even -- the daily high).  
  
For my part, I am going to watch for a little bit before considering an entry ... . Generally prefer scalping a Yen cross during the Asian session, so also may have a gander at NZD/JPY, which appears to have more movement than the other Yen crosses.

Yen crosses getting a bit noisier. UJ has broken previous day's low; EJ testing underside of previous day's low; GJ in same boat. UJ probably most interesting of the three given the break of the daily low, but there is some fairly close support at 117.437, which represents last week's low.

UJ Short: On the 1H, there has been a bearish 1H 8/34 EMA cross, which occurred in the middle of the New York session. Currently, we are at last week's low, but bullish heikin-ashi are appearing on the 5 min., so we may see a bounce here, potentially to retest yesterday's low at 117.571. Also, the majority of the wicking has been on the lower end of candles this past hour, implying that some buyers are wading in to block movement below 117.30.

That was fun, but I can see that I will have to increase my lot sizes in order for this to be worth my while. Currently, my initial entry is 2 x equity, and I ordinarily peel the position off in thirds, and then scale in lot sizes equal to what I've peeled off if I get good movement in the direction of my original trade. That being said, I also want to reserve the option of being able to dollar cost average out of the position if I f up the trend direction (which makes for a real horrible night for a guy who's got a day job).  
  
I would also note that with the UJ short, a better entry would have been right at where the 8/34 EMA cross occurred on the 5 min. (around 117.75). I wouldn't probably have entered right there, but would have waited for the 8 EMA to present a good downward angle to wade in, but this would have increased what I would have gained from there to 117.25. Oh, well, twenty-twenty hindsight plus you can't be on all the time ... .  
  
Anyway, happy trading!

It's kind of a bummer having a day job ... . That's because when you open up the chart of the pair you were scalping the previous evening, you notice that were you to have stayed in the trade, you would have had a lot more water in your bucket:

Nature of the beast. Tonight the only thing I can see on the econ calendar is some JPY data in about an hour's time ... . That being said, there is always some muckey muck that will open up their mouths and spoil the show: [http://www.forexfactory.com/news.php?do=news&id=517989](http://www.forexfactory.com/news.php?do=news&id=517989) (RBNZ piehole comments that NZD rate is unjustifiable/unsustainable ... .)  
  
I will most likely be watching UJ, EJ, GJ again. Here are the levels:  
  
UJ Previous Day's High/Lo: 118.012/115.061; Previous Week's Low 117.455  
EJ Previous Day's High/Lo: 147.028/144.959; Previous Week's Low 146.401  
GJ Previous Day's High/Lo: 185.092/181.615; Previous Week's Low 184.966  
  
To me, the tone for probably at least the next couple of sessions will be one of Yen strength (assuming that that data I mentioned coming up isn't earth-shattering). UJ made an attempt to clear last week's low during the New York session, failed, and then preceded to fall back some 100 pips. But the fact that the pair rallied from 115.50 all the way to last week's low of 117.50-ish (nearly two hundred pips) is indicative of the fact that there may still be bulls lurking in this market who are buying on dips on a forecast for the currency north of 120.00.  
  
My thought last week that any correction that was overdue in UJ would be about to this area, but we now have uncertainties and generalized anxieties about Russia in the mix, which may be adding to a risk-off atmosphere (which people often claim contributes to flight to the Yen as a "safe haven" currency) which, in turn, may drive Yen crosses lower.

UJ Short: That cross was on the 1 min., BTW ... . Still waiting for it on the 5 min.

UJ Short: Agonizing wait, but there's the cross on the 5 min. of the 8/34 EMA's. It's been so tentative and without much momentum the past hour, so don't know that the movement will have follow-through.

Yen Crosses: Post-FOMC, it looks like the entire tone of the market has changed, at least for Yen crosses, with USD strength seeping quiet convincingly into the mix. UJ has broken last week's low and appears poised to break yesterday's high (although it is knocking at that door presently).  
  
EJ is a bit more muted, but also has broken last week's low; price is currently between yesterday's high and the Daily Fib Retracement .764 Pivot Point.  
  
GJ looks a bit more frisky, having just broken both last week's low and yesterday's high ... . Because of that, I may focus on GJ for this evening's scalping session, keeping a watchful eye on whether it can hold above yesterday's high at basically 185.00 even.  
  
With respect to all three, the 8/34's crossed a couple of hours ago, making the set up ideal for fingertrapping, although you generally want to try and get in on the move shortly after the cross on the 1H occurs to capture more of the potential move ... .

GJ: Currently right above yesterday's high, which is basically coincident with last week's low and also an important psych level (185 even).  
  
With GJ, I tend to go smaller lot size-wise since it tends to be somewhat wild ... .

GJ (5 Min.): The 8 EMA has gone somewhat flat with the past few heikin-ashi's (which are currently red), so I am waiting to see what happens here at this important level.

GJ Long: Initiating a long here ... at 185.114. You know the drill: SL to BE at +20 (maybe more for this pair; a lot of wicking); starting adding positions thereafter upon touches of the 8 EMA while peeling off pieces in the green, assuming continuation.

GJ Long: Looking at this chart, though, additions may be somewhat tricky. There is a lot of wicking through the 8 EMA, and I don't want to add positions every time it wicks through. I guess I'll just have to see as we go ... .  
  
Basically when you add a position, you also want price to move a bit in the direction of the trend before adding an other one anyways, so you may not want to add on every touch anyhow.

Unfortunately, I have had like zero time to scalp recently ... . That being said, I have been looking at scalping techniques alternative to the fingertrap method (which goes for continuation and larger gains than just a few pips) which go for small pippage only (3-5 pips in most cases) because, point in fact, I don't really have a "system" for scalping in the particularly quiet Asian markets where the ATR's are frequently less than 5 pips for certain periods of time.  
  
In researching this, I stumbled across John Paul's Trade to Win videos on YouTube. Although he mainly trades S&P futures, I think he's got a couple of good tips, one of which is, if using the 5 min. charts for your scalping, use a 4 period ATR to look at what the last 4 bars of ATR are and limit your TP to that ATR. Naturally, if the market is too quiet, i.e., the 4 period ATR is insufficient to clear both spread and/or commission, well, then you shouldn't be trading at that time.

The other tip involves dividing the markets (Asian, London, and New York) into 2 1/2 hour segments and looking at the segment of the market immediately preceding the period in which you're trading to inform the direction of your trades (i.e., trending higher, going sideways, trending lower, breaking out, etc.). 

Inserted Video

  
  
The only unfortunate thing is that he uses a proprietary indicator (called the Atlas line) that informs the direction of his trades, so you'll have to find an alternative indicator to inform your trade direction ... .

Although this thread is entitled the U.S. Day Job Scalper, I've also been looking at other mechanical methods for scalping during the day (I'll eventually retire and need something to do to occupy my time). One of these methods is the opening range breakout. The basic proposition is to take the first 15 min. opening candle and then trade breakouts from the hi/lo of that candle, going long if price breaks above the candle, short if it breaks below. Naturally, if a clear trend is evident, you would trade in the direction of the trend, taking profit at, for example, the previous ten period's ATR. Here's an example:

In this particular case, the trade would have hit the proposed TP based on the ATR of the previous 10 15 min. candles. Naturally, that would be insufficient for most folks to make a profitable day of it, so additional methods would have to be used to trade the rest of the first 2 1/2 hours of the New York session ... .  
  
The only drawback I would think is that if that particular candle is indecisional (e.g., a doji), in which case I probably would not trade based on that candle alone ... .

The notion is to add upon touches of the 8 EMA if there is a good angle and then move the SL to BE or BE + a few. Naturally don't want to do this if it flattens out ... .

Fully expect to get stopped out here shortly, but the SL's about 6 pips in the money, so ... a good time for a break ... . Will be back later to see if there's continuation (my guess, looking at how the 8 EMA is flattening out right now, I wouldn't bet on it ... ).

Probably going to get stopped out here, but this may be worth watching for another entry somewhere ... .  
  
I would prefer a 8/34 EMA cross or break through this circled area of support, where there appears to be some buying interest:

So, I'm basically back to watching with particular interest for a short at 1.53725 or so ... .

Drilling down to the 1 min. (which I rarely actually use), you can see why the 1.5372 area is of interest; similarly it looks like we've got minor resistance at 1.5425:

1.5425 marks where the initial impulsive candle (virtually immediately at poll closing, at which time projected results were issued) stopped briefly before retracing back to 1.5372 and then pulsed higher to 1.545 or so, retreating back below 1.5425, testing that level from below, after which it slid to 1.5372, from where it has bounced a bit ... .

Crap ... . It's dawdling here ... . One option is to just set up a pender below that support line at 1.5375 targeting 1.528 or so. I'm wary of doing that, since we're likely to see a bit of possible whipsawing every time a significant election result report comes in ... . So you could get one of those whipsaws that hits the entry, but then whips against you ... .

That being said, if it's anything like the Scottish independence vote, it's likely to be a long night, full of potential for pippage ... . If the BBC projections prove correct (and I'm not counting on anything), GU is going to give up most of these 150 pips ... . The spike, after all, was due to a projection for a Tory win; the BBC is saying that the Conservatives will fall 7 seats shy of that ... .  
  
So, I'm looking short, at least for now ... .

Getting close to an 8/34 EMA cross, but I'm not getting excited about it ... . The aspects of both EMA's are basically flat, so a cross here wouldn't be saying much ... . The two lines may wind back and forth across each other as the market awaits clearer election results ... .

I guess I should have considered the other possibility -- a breakout above that top at 1.545 ... . Dang ... . Now that 1.545 is support ... .  
  
That being said, I did get a few pips out of the pair to the downside, so it's not all bad ... .

Even if I do get an entry if price breaks out below .7421, there isn't that much room for continuation through .74 even, which has provided previous resistance on higher time frames, so I don't necessarily expect much out of the scalp ... . You never know, though ... . The next meaningful resistance below .74 is .73-ish ... .

Got my confirming candle. I would like to wait to enter on a bounce/touch/penetration of the 8 EMA at this point ... .  
  
Or, in the alternative, a test of the underside of .7421 ... .

Sad trombone music ... stopped out ... . Back to waiting for a better entry ... . Maybe wait for a break of the yesterday's low ... .

Like watching paint dry ... . Waiting for an 8/34 EMA cross to the downside again ... . Was rejected by .7900, but this thing may very well bobble around between .79 and yesterday's low for quite some time ... . Gotta accept that the Asian session is slow ... .

This looks like it's going to be annoying for a while ... . The thing to do is set up a text alert for when price breaks that .789 again which it might very possible not do again for quite a bit of time. Back in a bit ... .

Back to where we started at the beginning ... .  
  
The 8/34's have crossed to the downside, but price is still above that level (.7887) it bounced off the last time around (frankly, that really didn't look like clear support to me ... ).
