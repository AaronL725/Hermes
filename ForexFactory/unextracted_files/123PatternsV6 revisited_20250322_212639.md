**Welcome Traders**  
  
The purpose of this thread is to continue to develop trading rules based on 123 patterns.  
  
In November 2010 I published an indicator called **123PatternsV6**. That indicator was the result of much discussion and development work in a thread called [[Multiple Trading systems gbpusd only](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=250606)]. [Zamanib](http://www.forexfactory.com/zamanib) started that thread and I recognise his valuable work on that project.  
  
The version of 123PatternsV6 that I use is unchanged for more than a year now and can be downloaded from that previous thread.  
  
[Download 123PatternsV6](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=4148791#post4148791)  
  
**123Alarms** addon see [post #27](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5148661#post5148661)  
**123Alarms** update with email alerts [post #1286](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5199458#post5199458) (7 Dec 2011)  
  
**Why a new thread ?**  
  
I am starting this new thread to start with a new focus and avoid confusion with that previous multiple systems thread.  
  
**Guidelines to keep this thread on-track**  
  
This thread's focus is using 123PatternsV6 for trading decisions.

  1. 123PatternsV6 custom indicator only
  2. No other custom indicators or systems discussed here
  3. Any MT4 built-in indicators and chart objects are OK
  4. Any currency pair is OK
  5. Any time frame is OK

**Thread Housekeeping**

  1.  _Normal charts only_. Go to the previous thread (listed above) for a discussion of rangebar and other charts.
  2. Keep posted charts clean and easy to read. Use MT4 _File.Save As Picture_ to create gifs. Use the _attachment button_ in FF post editor to upload gifs and then insert into your post. This way we will not get those huge chart images wrapping the thread off the screen.
  3. _When quoting someone else delete most of their post_. There is no point quoting an entire 50 line post with a one or two line response. Learn how to use the editor properly, quote only the relevant words and cut the rest.

**Goals**  
  
As you know a complete trading system involves much more than somebody's favorite indicator. Risk management, position sizing, timing, trading journals to evaluate progress, entry rules, exit rules and so on.  
  
**My goal for this thread is to work together on understanding 123 patterns, when are they useful, and when they are not.**  
  
In my posts I will filter out my own 'great ideas' or 'rules' that do not actually support consistent profit making. For example if adding a moving average looks cool/interesting but in reality makes it harder to make profitable trading decisions then it must be removed.  
  
If you have an interest in 123 patterns and would like to work towards these goals then welcome trader, let's do some work.  
  
_Robdee_  
  
PS **Indicator support.** Please use the private message system for support questions. Do not post support questions in this thread. Thanks.  
  
PPS **Removing rubbish posts**. As moderator of this thread I will remove posts that I consider to be irrelevant or just basically rubbish. I know in my naive enthusiasm I've posted rubbish in some threads in the past. I know how it happens. This is a not a personal attack, it is just keeping the place tidy as a learning environment.

**123PatternsV6 uses ZigZag which comes with MT4.**  
  
To understand this use a plain chart, add ZigZag only, then go to any candle and look back in time. **What are the last three points made by ZigZag? Label those points 1 2 3.** When price continues from point 3 to go past point 2 then we have a break. Some people call this _1-2-3-break_.

Ideally the move from point 1 to point 2 should be more pips than the move from point 2 back to point 3. In other words point 3 is somewhere in the middle between point 1 and 2. I say 'ideal' because that alignment strongly suggests that 1 to 2 is an **impulse move** (with the trend) and 2 to 3 is a **retrace move** (against the trend). This provides evidence of trend direction.  
  
In summary ZigZag filters the noise and allows us to focus consistently on just the most important high/low points. **With ZigZag only we can easily observe:**

  1. previous three price points before any particular candle in time
  2. three price points forming a 1 2 3 pattern
  3. price retracing from 2 to 3
  4. price trend continuing and breaking past 2

We also have **two categories** of 123 patterns. First, those patterns where 3 is ideally located in between 1 and 2. Second, those patterns where 3 is located beyond 1. Some would say this second category breaks the pattern and is therefore not a valid 123 anymore.  
  
I prefer to call these two categories **ideal patterns** and **distorted patterns**.  
  
Robdee  
  
PS Something to think about - How does the 123-break pattern relate to the popular _higher-high higher-low_ concept, is it the same thing ?

First I want to welcome and thank _Forexcube zamanib ukcool HankT_ and _gprfc_. Your interest and support is appreciated. I like to look at FF user profiles and try to imagine what it is like to be living (and trading) in those places all over the world where you are living now.  
  
Here in [New Zealand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand) it is spring. Gardens, lambs and calves are all growing fast right now. Gusty winds cover the country as we change seasons. I went for my 'first swim of the season' in the harbour recently. It was still pretty cold but refreshing and I am looking foward to long summer days.  
  
It would be nice to read descriptions of other places where traders live.  
  
**Now about this indicator...**  
  
In my first few posts to this thread I am going to start simple and build up layer by layer. This will allow readers to see the foundation ideas that went into this indicator. In the last post I showed that something as simple as just dropping ZigZag on the chart will give you a lot of information.  
  
I think it is important to actually do that. Manually insert text labels 1 2 3 break on to a chart that has ZigZag only. You will get a better feel for what the indi is trying to do. Notice those places where patterns overlap or it is hard to tell the difference between bullish and bearish patterns.  
  
**Basic Setup**  
  
For a basic setup we keep ZigZag on the chart and overlay 123PatternsV6 on top. We change the indicator settings turning **off** ShowAllLines ShowAllBreaks and ShowTargets. ZigZag had a default depth of 12 so we set our indicator to the same **ZigZagDepth=12**.  
  
Now we can see (on top of ZigZag) the blue dots, red dots, and break arrows as below.

I demo'd the 1 2 3 a year or so ago and had so-so results, not enough for me to continue. The problem I found was that #3 often didn't break the #2 position or broke it just a little so that i got into a trade but then reversed. I will watch your alls progress with the indicators listed to see how this "New and Improved" version goes. Thanks for posting, p.

Welcome piprac. I agree with you, in some situations 123 patterns are **not useful**. However, I also know that there are other situations where 123 patterns **are useful**.  
  
That is the goal of this thread as in post #1  
  
"**My goal for this thread is to work together on understanding 123 patterns, when are they useful, and when they are not.** "  
  
In other words

  1. what are the strengths and weaknesses of 123 analysis
  2. what are the limitations
  3. what market conditions are best
  4. what times are best
  5. what other study do we combine with it
  6. and so on...

Just to clarify this, **the indicator is not new and improved**. It is the same indicator we were using a year ago.  
  
What can become _new and improved_ is our understanding and trading practice. To do that requires the efforts of trial, error, and tracking our progress.

Hello  
The MTF zigzag indicator looks good,where can i find this,i would like to use this along with the 123 indicator.  
Robdee made my first pips using the 123 setup taking it slowly as this is the first time i have used this strategy.

Welcome _AlexM80 Udine Eamonn simmo24_ and _porfiro_ , good to have your feedback. Looks like I better carry on with more posts ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
In the last post I described the **basic setup** using ZigZag and my indicator. With the basic setup only _ideal_ 123 patterns are shown with red dots for bearish and blue dots for bullish. _Distorted_ patterns are ignored and not highlighted at all with a basic setup.  
  
**Now on to the next layer...**  
  
To the basic setup I now add **sell zones**. A red arrow points to the _first candle to close below_ (2). This shows that the bears are strong enough to push the price down and close below that previous price level (2) where the bulls last showed their strength. _At this point who is winning, the bulls or the bears ?_  
  
The price level where that **red arrow** is printed now becomes a guide for future selling interest. A _sell zone_ then is an area of _future selling interest_.   
  
I draw this with a **pale green rectangle** that covers the red arrow and stretches out into the future. The bears were winning at that price once before so they will remember that price. The bears will be interested in being strong at that price again to sell more lots or to defend their short positions.  
  
The bulls will also remember that they were beaten at that level and will push up to retest the strength of the bears. If the _bulls_ give up that fight too easily then price will drop away too fast and will not come back into that _interesting_ sell zone. In that case I will not have a trade entry which is OK with me.

For my trades **I am only interested in selling when price comes into the sell zone**. If I liked I could enter immediately after the break. I could grab some pips that way. However the reason I do not do this is I am usually not watching the chart when that happens (so I miss my chance) and I also like to see some _bullish_ strength (pushing price back up into the sell zone) so I have the bulls enthusiastically filling my sell limit orders (as a result of their buying activity).  
  
_Does that make sense ?_

A few people have been asking about **audio alerts** for 123PatternsV6.  
  
There is an add-on called **123Alarms**. It can be downloaded from the old thread.  
  
[Download 123Alarms](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=4166864#post4166864)  
  
Please note that it **does not require rangebars**. Just 123PatternsV6 on normal charts will give 123Alarms everything it needs.  
  
The chart must be in the **active window** (active MT4 profile) for processing to occur and the alarm to activate. If you switch away to a different MT4 profile then the alarm will be mute because that chart is not being processed any more.  
  
You can **make your own .WAV sound files** to be used with the alarm.  
  
Hope that all makes sense ?

Welcome davidtrader, thanks for your question.  
  
A sell zone is not an exact price line. Rather it is a broad 'zone' or range of prices roughly 10 pips high. I like to think of it as _colouring_ _with a crayon_. It is not a precise _to the pip_ area, it is a 'zone'.  
  
Use the MT4 menu **Insert.Shapes.Rectangle**. Start drawing just above and to the left of a red arrow, drag the rectangle down to cover all of the arrow and across to the right to form a long thin horizonal rectangle.  
  
I set the rectangle properties as below

The most **successful sell zones** will occur after the bulls have had a successful run up to a new high. They still think they are winning even after the first _bearish_ 123-break. That is when they (the overconfident bulls) are going to push back into the sell zone filling my sell limit orders.

Thanks _JulesvH cmac0351 spyderman_ and _billbss_ for your comments. I see your experience and welcome your input.  
  
Also welcome two junior members _xalson_ and _davidtrader_. Your very first post was made in this thread. Looks like something here motivated you to join FF and make a post - great ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
At this early stage of the thread **I am describing the basic ideas** that went into the indicator when we were developing it a year ago. These concepts should appear in most any discussion of 123 patterns. Different authors will use different terms to describe what is essentially the same price behaviour and the same analysis. This can be confusing.  
  
What I have been trying to do is use **clear and consistent terms** that then provide a foundation for our further discussion. If you use the same terms that I do then confusion (in this thread) will be avoided.  
  
**Summary of Terms**  
Terms used in the first four main posts are underlined below.  
  
Using Zigzag only [post #5](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5139774#post5139774)

  1. 123 patterns are an important feature of price action
  2. Looking back in time you will always see three previous _price points_
  3. Zigzag draws our attention to the most important price points
  4. Charts with Zigzag alone provide a lot of information
  5. Two categories of patterns, _ideal_ and _distorted_

Basic Setup [post #7](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5140817#post5140817)

  1. basic setup highlights _ideal_ patterns only, not _distorted_ patterns
  2. add 123PatternsV6 on top of Zigzag with matching depths
  3. turn **off** ShowAllLines ShowAllBreaks and ShowTargets
  4. red dots and arrows for _bearish patterns_
  5. blue dots and arrows for _bullish patterns_

When are 123 patterns useful? [post #14](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5143910#post5143910)

  1. 123 patterns are _not always useful_
  2. 123 patterns _are useful in some situations_
  3. an important goal of this thread is to understand what makes the difference between _successful_ and _failed_ 123-break patterns

Basic Setup Sell Zones [post #17](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5144951#post5144951)

  1. Following a _bearish_ 123-break pattern a decision is required about a time and a price for selling
  2. An _aggressive_ decision sells _immediately_ after a break (no wait)
  3. A _conservative_ decision _waits for price to retrace_ up into a _sell zone_
  4. Consistent sell zone pricing is provided by the red arrow
  5. Sell zones are _interesting_ because they are remembered by both bears and bulls as old battle lines
  6. Sell zones are _useful_ because they offer buying volume to fill limit orders
  7. Sell zones are not an exact price line, they are a small range of prices roughly 10 pips high

OK, that is all I can think of this morning. _Have I missed anything?_  
  
Now is a **good time for feedback and questions** on these terms and concepts before we carry on.

Robdee,  
  
I noticed that the sell zones are seem to be higher (on a short) then the price you would have entered on an aggressive break entry. Is that correct.   
  
And in post #30 the 2nd sell zone is even above point #3. Will we be discussing the mechanics of the sell zone placement later?  
  
Thanks,

Spyderman, great questions. You have found a weak area that I was unwittingy being rather too vague about. Thanks.

Yes that is correct. _Aggressive_ entry prices are below 2. The red arrow points to the very first candle to close below price point 2. I see an aggressive entry as the open price of the following candle. Break candle closes, arrow has printed, market order now - no hesitation.  
  
_Conservative_ entries wait for price to break and then move higher into the range above 2 (and normally below 3). This is what the sell zone represents. An area of _future_ selling interest as opposed to _immediate_ selling interest. As the charts show, there are many situations where price action does not return into the sell zone and the conservative entry is not achieved. This can usually be explained by strong bearish pressure overwhelming the bulls.

I'm going to discuss this right now because it is an area of weakness and certainly needs improving. **Determining a good price level for the sell zone has been problematic.** Last year I tried all sorts of ideas for the placement of the arrows (which act as a guide for the sell zones).  
  
**123PatternsV6 prints arrows using the following calculation.**

SellArrow[shift] = High[shift]+(High[shift]-Low[shift])/3;  
  
In other words look at the breaking candle. Calculate the range (size) of that candle (range=high-low). Divide that range by 3. Add that value to the high and print the arrow at that price.  
  
In effect the arrows are printed _above_ the breaking candle at a variable distance from the candle (1/3 of the candle height).  
  
If the candle size is large then arrow will be further above. If the candle size is small the arrow will be lower. In other words if there is a lot of momentum we expect a stronger pullback. Assuming that the bulls don't give up the fight.  

Blue arrows are the mirror image of this. They are printed _below_ the breaking candle at a variable distance (1/3 of the candle height).  
  
Why am I so interested in sell zones? The reason is I can see a time when I'm going to be searching for liquidity. If I can **find a place where the bulls are overconfident** and buying into my sell orders for significant periods of time then liquidity will not become a limiting factor.  
  
OK, any more questions?   
  
_Robdee_  
  
Note: I have been out on my own with this sell zone thing because most participants in the old thread (last year) were using aggressive entries.

Davidtrader, good to see your chart posting. What I notice right away is your chart is one hour (H1) timeframe. That means the distance between 123 price points is huge, like 100+ pips. Which means in theory that appropriate stops are going to be pretty large too, so as to fit the pattern size of H1.  
  
As a learning exercise I suggest using 5 min timeframe. You'll get a lot more practice because patterns come along more frequently. Plus you will not need more than 20 pip stops operating at that level.  
  
See below my labels on the EURUSD H1 pattern that you posted.

**Stop Losses - What I do**  
  
Stop losses are best left to personal preference. Your stop management needs to match your own trading personality. However, I will explain what I do.  
  
**My approach to stops** is to take me out _fast_ if I am wrong. So I simply use a 20 pip stop in _all_ situations. If I haven't selected the right entry price (within a 20 pip margin of error) then I want to be taken out quickly. This _clears my mind_ of the bad trade and allows me to re-evaluate without the emotional pressure of being stuck in a losing position.  
  
Often I will chase an entry down getting taken out at 20 pip intervals until I find a better entry that holds. Although this cuts into profits pretty deeply it is the way I like to operate. That is, keep pruning out bad trades until I find a place where I can "buy and hold" for 100 pips.  
  
Now there are a couple of other things I do with stops. As soon as price moves to +20 above my entry price I move the stop from -20 to breakeven. This means that if price bounces back against me I lose nothing.  
  
When price moves to +50 above my entry price I start trailing pip for pip. This means my stop keeps moving up (trailing) 50 pips below the most recent high. This means if my TP target is not reached I'll still bank some pips.  
  
Hope that helps. Would be good if experienced traders share their own stop loss rules in this thread.

Thanks for starting this no-frills thread. Amazing little indicator that cuts through the "fog" of trading.

Welcome Joeyd, I like your description 'no frills' and 'cuts through the fog'. I see Zigzag as the basis of this 'fog' cutting. I just want to focus on what is important, not get distracted by all the little price gyrations.  
  
This post is a followup to my suggestion to start on 5m charts.

On a 5 min chart we are operating on a smaller scale. The average distance between the three price points is less. Friday 18 was a textbook perfect example of where 123 patterns show how _useful_ they can be.

How do we describe and recognise these ideal conditions - as they are happening ?  
That is the challenge, that is the goal of this thread.

Good question.  
  
123Alarms uses the default setting from 123PatternsV6.mq4  
  
The only way to change that default setting is to edit the code and recompile the indicator.

  1. MT4 menu Tools.Metaquotes Language Editor F4
  2. Open the file called 123PatternsV6.mq4
  3. Look for this line  
**extern int ZigZagDepth = 1;**
  4. Change it to the new value**  
extern int ZigZagDepth = 12;**
  5. Recompile

I forgot about this because in the old thread we were using rangebars and ZigZagDepth=1 was best setting for constant rangebar charts.

This post shows the same basic setup with one more layer added.  
I call this layer **Fibo Targets**.  
  
Fibonacci retrace tool is used to draw one fibo with five levels configured at 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.1, and 3.8. The **fibo is always drawn starting at price point 2**. The fibo is then stretched out to price point 3. If that looks too small then I drag the fibo further out to price point 1.

This is the only variation I use with the basic setup. Start drawing at 2, drag to 3, if that is too small, drag to 1 (instead of 3). So the fibo's dotted line will always show on the chart as linking either 2-3 or 2-1.

Hello Robdee  
I have your indicator setup on a chart for the last few days,and have notices when the 123 setup arrow prints on the chart it also shows the round coloured dots to show the candles that form the 123.  
However sometimes the arrow shows when the candle closes without the round coloured dots and i then refresh the indicator and the arrow dissapears would this not be a confirmed 123 or does the indicator repaint ?  
Regards

Hi simmo24, the dots identify price points that make up the 123 pattern, **arrows signify the 'break' part of the pattern**. A decision to buy or sell depends on all the factors including things like timing and previous price action.  
  
In the next version of 123Patterns **I will not be using arrows** to highlight the break candles. I will use some other method that does not seem to say 'buy here' and 'sell here' like arrows do. Arrows tend to make people think, "OK time to trade" which is not right.  
  
In the chart that you posted you have not switched off ShowAllLines and ShowAllBreaks therefore you are seeing arrows that are not associated with ideal 123 patterns. In other words you are seeing arrows that are associated with distorted 123 patterns. The **basic setup** I have been explaining requires ShowAllLines=false ShowAllBreaks=false ShowTargets=False ZigZagDepth=12.

  1. Dots show only the 123 price points for _ideal_ patterns
  2. No dots will show on 123 price points for _distorted_ patterns
  3. Arrows point to the first candle closing beyond #2, the _start of the break_

_Does that answer your question ? hope so.  
  
Robdee_

how about **too small**? this means in pips(how pips) or lengh of 2 wave or ...?

If there are no coloured dots when the arrow appears this sounds to me like ShowAllBreaks=true which allows break arrows to show on distorted patterns. **Distorted patterns are not well defined** and it is possible that an arrow could be printed only to be erased again after more price action pushes the ZigZag price points further out. I have seen this occur.  
  
It is also possible that you are using ShowAllBreaks=false and there is some kind of repaint problem with the indicator that I am not yet aware of. I switch MT4 chart profiles quite often which means my indicator displays are being refreshed often so I certainly could miss something like the repaint you describe.

Perfectly thanks. Just re-read the post about distorted patterns. I was happy enough with the concept of price zones. Now you've reminded me about distorted patterns, all has become clear. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

They are both drawn correctly. It is a matter of choosing which one you prefer. I prefer 2-1 in that situation. What concerns me is that your chart shows prices breaking below #3, that is a bearish sign for sure.

My general rule is placing the buy limit orders inside the buy zone.  
  
In the chart you posted there is a problem because some candles are closing below 3. That is bearish. So, in that specific situation I will not be trading an uptrend because those bearish closes mean the bullish 123 pattern is no longer valid.  
  
[Attachment ](https://www.forexfactory.com/attachment/file/838209)  
  
Another way to look at this is to oberve the poor quality of the break. Yes one candle closed above 2 but then the very next candle closed below 2. There is no follow-through on the break so it is not good quality. When I see this it makes me suspicious that it is a fake-out not a break-out. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61f.png?v=15.1)

**As a forex trader, what data can I ignore?**  
  
More specifically, when looking for trade setups, what data can be ignored? This is a question I asked in a poll last year. Many traders have many systems and various rules. However most of them can agree on a few categories of data that can safely be ignored.  
  
Which ones do you think can be ignored?

Time of day (eg London Open, London Close)  
Volume and changes in Volume  
Wicks on candles (upper and lower)  
The range of candles (high - low)  
Patterns (channels, triangles, waves etc)  
Technical analysis 'news' posts on FF news page  

Or to put this another way, what data should _not_ be ignored?  
  
[Click here to vote in the poll](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=257671) and see the results.  
  
And now from yesterday's NY session, one sell pattern was successful, followed by three buy patterns that fail, what makes the difference ?

greetings everyone,   
  
may i ask you robdee, regarding this method, on what sessions do you normally trade this setup? do you stick on M5 alone and disregard higher TF's, and trends?  
  
regards

_Frank, kamusta ang buhay ?

I am looking for liquidity > average so that means trading 6:30 to 18:30 GMT (12 hours of good liquidity).  
  
I use 123PatternsV6 on M5 to gain understanding of correct use. Later I may migrate to higher TFs when I understand 123 patterns very well.  
  
For big picture analysis, trends, overbought/oversold areas I use 200MA, fibos, and CCI(14) on H4 chart.  
  
For fundamental risk-on versus risk-off sentiment I use SP500 futures daily chart combined with [NYSE TRIN index](http://www.quote.com/us/stocks/chart.aspx?s=%5ETRIN) closing values.

hey, what other technical aspects are there to this setup. do you use cci 200 like one poster said? or is it only the 123's and volume during trading times? can you please elaborate further on the pure technical "how to find and enter the trade" robdee ?

Sure will do. Remember the reason this thread exists is to _develop_ the ideas further from what we were doing a year ago, hence the title "123PatternsV6 revisited".  
  
**Sell zones** and **buy zones** are well described in this thread. That is how I find and enter a trade. It is also becoming clear to me that the 123-break is most reliable during times when there is greater than average liquidity.  
  
No other technical inputs, no use of any oscillators or moving averages. That guy who was using CCI(200) was on H4 charts which doesn't suit what I'm trying to do. I don't understand how he proposed to trade that.  
  
On M5 I'm only looking for small intraday swings so expect to TP at +50 and +100, not much more than that.  
  
This thread is pretty wide open in terms of developing the art of 123 pattern analysis. If you know some technique that improves our ability to make profitable trading decisions (and it's not some other custom indicator or EA) then you're welcome to post it here.

Welcome wallstreet03,  
  
I suggest you label the three previous price points 1 2 3 and then you may be able to see what is happening. I can see why the blue arrow did not print at that time you highlight.  
  
If you have ShowAllBreaks=true then yes you will get arrows that print and then disappear. There are recent posts on this topic.

Hi Robdee interesting thread, aspects of this are reminding me of Ross Hooks (joe ross traders trick entry), the retrace to your entry zone would be the correcting bars of the traders trick entry, but are you trying to stay totally clear of price bars in your technique?

Nice post spacePip, I'm not sure what you mean about avoiding price bars, do you mean 'constant rangebar charts' which yes I am avoiding those. In a rangebar chart all the bars are the same height but their time durations are variable.  
  
The chart you posted is an 'M5 bar chart' that simply uses bars (instead of candles) to represent the same OHLC values for each time period. In my mind there is no difference between that and an 'M5 candle chart'.  
  
If you are able to explain a brief summary of the Ross Hooks approach (or post a link to an existing summary) that will be appreciated. Looks like it provides a very specific entry criteria which may be useful.  
  
_Robdee  
  
_Update: I found [this posting](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=5646) from Joe Ross the inventor of the Ross Hook _.

spacepip: nice one, i got the very same trade! :-)  
  
robdee: thank you for the fast answer. i understand the concept of the sellzone/buyzone, however i really did not think about that spot for entries before reading this thread. i usually do trade 123s though. i must add though that i have had a hard time in finding "good" 123s and sorting out the bad ones. that is why i brought up the concept of forceindicators thinking that they somehow would eleiviate this from my trading. i am looking forward to the sollution of this if there is one. lets work this out together eh! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

Emb, I agree with you and I'm glad you're participating in the main goal of this thread. Thanks for your comments.  
  
The last several posts have been sidetracking, that's OK it is useful, but now I need to get back to the main topic of this thread which is...

The last post I made on the main topic was [What data can I ignore ?](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5158789#post5158789)  
  
In that post I referred to a poll I have been running asking traders to select multiple categories of data which they think are **safe to ignore** as they evaluate trading setups.  
  
What is the **least important** data available to us? More than 60% selected _Technical analysis 'news' posts on FF news page._ Yes, safe to ignore, I certainly agree with that. I don't even read those TA 'news articles' because they distract me and play with my mind. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f615.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/2753.png?v=15.1)  
  
By contrast the **most important** data (that cannot safely be ignored) according to traders are these two:  

  1. The range of candles (high - low)
  2. Patterns (channels, triangles, waves etc)

Only 15% voted to ignore these two. In other words **85%** are saying these two categories of data must be included in the analysis.  
  
OK, _patterns_ I can understand, we use all kinds of patterns. This thread is all about one of the simplest and most common patterns out there. I agree, patterns must not be ignored.  
  
Now what about the _range_ or size of candles. The number of pips from the top of the candle to the bottom. From the highest bid to the lowest bid during that time period. Is a 30 pip candle telling us something different from a 10 pip candle ? No I don't think so.  
  
It is all just OHLC isn't it? Seems to me the _Close_ is the important thing. So why are 85% saying we can't ignore range? Maybe the way I worded the question has biased the answers, I don't know.  
  
The **second part** of that post [What data can I ignore ?](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5158789#post5158789) showed a chart with one **successful** pattern and three **failed** patterns. What makes the difference, any ideas?  
  
I have some ideas but I'm waiting for responses to my question. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

First buy fails because it hits resistance (old support from point 2 in successful sell 123-break).  
Second buy - does it really fail? It appears to be successful for several bars and the amount it moves is small because of low volume.  
Third buy fails because of low volume and resistance (same resistance that caused first buy to fail).

im interested to join, this is one setup i use to open up a trade.  
  
this is so widely used and discussed here in FF, and also called in different name according to the starter of the thread. others may find me wrong on how i use this method but this is how i understand this and operate so please just correct me if im wrong. in hope to help new traders like me and by the essence of sharing and caring ill share to you my friends how i use this method along with the other edge that ive learned from generous senior traders out there. thanks and more power to them.  
i believe this setup is powerful if done properly, specially if we use this in conjunction with the general trend, S/R areas, divergence, volume or smart money flow, and right session. though these setups always happen the whole trading day i leave the preference to you.  
so this is how i do it: i check and plot the S/R on the higher TF H1-H4, then i watch the Price Action on those plotted areas of S/R on M15 down to M5. i prefer to hunt this 123,abc etc. setup on M5 because for me that timeframe is my comfort zone R:R wise.   
then if i was lucky to find an entry (mostly aggressive), MM applies. (i leave this to you or you can share us your MM style its up to the owner of this thread if he allows it to be discussed).  
the broken 123, 2b or the 2nd type of 123 pattern robdee is telling us, i was adviced to hunt that at the end of the run, so when i saw that pattern after the divergence, that signals that the end of the run is near and tells me to close the trade. and steal for at least another 10-15 pips.  
attachment below speaks a thousand words, i hope i was able to relay to you guys what i mean.  
  
again this is not mine, ive just learned this from those senior traders out there who are so generous to assist new traders like us. more power and thanks to them.  
  
hope this helps  
  
regards   
frank

Sorry i rushed the post didn't make it clear, I didn't mean rangebars, I was simply referring to normal chart candles/ bars and whether you are keen to use them with this method, or are you just sticking to the plain chart with only the zigzag indicator?  
  
If you are open to using candles or bars then the Ross Hooks could be of interest as a way of entry when price retraces back into your buy/ sell zones. Basically a ross hook is described as "the first correction following a breakout of a 123 high/ low" so this is similar to what you are looking for. Entry is triggered with a break of one of the correcting (retracing) bars.  
  
There is lots of free info on the internet about this if you google joe ross and im sure a thread on here somewhere, but the following pdf explains it well

The **second part** of that post [What data can I ignore ?](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5158789#post5158789) showed a chart with one **successful** pattern and three **failed** patterns. What makes the difference, any ideas?

The buy and sell zones are reminiscent of Supply /Demand zones and if looked at in this light the buy trades fail because they are still in what could be considered a supply zone that extends from the the first trade.

Thanks spacePip for bringing this to our attention. Your explanation and the PDF you provided both make good sense to me in the context of what we are trying to achieve. The PDF provides sufficient information without overwhelming detail. I don't think we need to get into any deeper details of Joe Ross's work here. As you say there is plenty more Joe Ross information available on the 'net for those who are interested.  
  
This style of analysis, comparing bar-by-bar is what I call _price action_. Any chart style, tool, or indicator _built into Metatrader is OK_ in this thread. What I am _against_ is getting wildly off topic discussing various _custom_ indicators and EAs.  
  
Observing the price action within a buy/sell zone using Ross Hooks and TTE **gives traders a defined price and time for action.** That final prompt, _"see price has dropped below the last retracing bar, you are good to sell,"_ may be that small extra edge of confidence needed to take appropriate action.  
  
Not being a chart-watcher I will find it difficult to catch exactly the right TTE moment on a live chart. However I will illustrate past RH/TTE price action in some of my future chart postings.

Picture perfect structure on London's bearish session yesterday.  
  
Everything I'm looking for including no candles closing above the 50% fibo after the break.

Global markets generally looking oversold now so I'm expecting a bounce today, I'll see what 123 analysis is saying at the London Open. Asia is already up 60 pips from the low.

Hi emb, yes I agree at the time you wrote that it was a bullish picture.  
  
Bearish interest was seen in candles below the buy zone. Later, three separate attempts closing below 50% showed persistent bearish interest.

As a result the bears successfully defended 1.34  
Now we'll see what the bulls do at 1.33

yes i did see that 123 long in the london session and i did take that long. from your "buy zone" i also noted the second 123 short however i did not want to go with that because i am of the understanding that agressive breakouts of 123's do not provide enough wins for me.. or maybe the do but i lack the statistics for them.  
  
what is your take on this? going for the "buy/sell zone" entry vs the agressive entry at point 2.

I placed a pending on that London setup but this one failed. I did notice that the 50 fib was quite a few pips below the buy zone so no real confluence.

Hello Traders!!!  
  
Thank you Robdee for the indicator. It's good visual help for those that are not familiar with 123 pattern.  
  
Atached you will find today's EURUSD M5 chart, where I had highligted #3 at what you call distorted pattern. Do you know why there is no arrow signal?   
  
Thank you

My preference is always conservative entry inside the zone. Aggressive does work sometimes even with a tight SL, scalpers probably do well with it grabbing some quick pips on the break of 2.  
  
The sequence that interests me is 1 2 3 break, retrace candles, then TTE. If the TTE occurs in the zone and above 50% fibo that's perfect.

Yes my failed trade was similar setup although earlier. I was feeling too much pressure to get into a trade. If the bulls were in control I don't think we would see all that price action below 50 fib.  
  
The other point I garnered from Joe Ross is **successful 123 patterns follow a strong directional move** , they do not follow after sideways consolidation.

Welcome PartyPips, good question. Just before I answer that take another look at your 123 numbering. 2 is always in the direction you expect the price to move. So for a bearish pattern 2 is the always the lowest number. For a bullish pattern 2 is always the highest number.  
  
OK, yes there was a candle that closed below the bearish point 2 (that you label 1). The problem was the red line coming from that point **did not stay intact**. This is a side effect of using ZigZag to find the price points. I accepted this limitation during last year's development but it did cause concern for those trying to catch absolutely every possible break.

Here is an example of a distorted bearish pattern where the red line coming from point 2 did remain intact. It remained intact long enough for a candle to clearly close below it. That is what 123Patterns is looking for to print the red arrow.

Hello all,  
  
I just want to comment how do I trade using ZigZag:  
  
**About Equity Management & Risk to Reward Ratio:**  
  
I'm sure that this is one of the most important when trading.  
  
Usually I only risk 2% of my account and go at least for the double of the risk. So, why I don't care and why I do care about stop loss in pips: I don't care because I will be risking 2%, it doesn't mater if the stop loss is 10 pips or 40 pips from my entry I will increase or decrease the lots to trade, and it will represent 2%. I do care, because if my stop loss it's 10 pips I will go for 20 pips (my minimum target will be the double) but if my stop loss it's 40 pips at least I will go for 80 pips, and for my it's much easier to take 20 than 80 and in both cases I will earn 4%.  
  
Why at least the double, because in the worst case if I'm only right 34% of the time I will be positive ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1).  
  
**About Entry, Stop Loss and Exit:**  
  
Entry: I do trade Ideal & Distorted patterns but I ALWAYS wait for a retracement using A- level off broken support or resistance (label #2) (the arrow at the indicator it's a good guide) or B- Fibo levels with the combiantion off candlesticks formation (the best ones: bullish or bearish engulfing and evening or morning star, and I also look for tweezer top or bottom and pin bars, nothing else)   
  
Important: if I don't have a new 123 pattern I will reentry in the same direction  
  
Stop Loss: 3 pips the high or low of the signal candle or the previous candle.  
  
Exit: Fibo targets 1.618 for retracements to 61.8% and 1.27 if the retracement was around 78.6% or just double the stop loss as target (i do this usually for the first and the second trade of the day "if" i'm planing not to work all day, but if the 2 firts trades are looser, them I keep trading using fibos target).  
NOTE: once I set my target I don't follow the market moving the stop loss. It's like set and forget  
  
Drawdown: 4 loosing trades in a row could happen in a single day, but you will recover it with fibo targets very fast, and yes, i had 5 and 6 loosing trades in a single day but they are not common  
  
Aditional Indicators: don't need it, 123 pattern it's all   
  
I will be posting some trades and you will see how it works.  
  
IMPORTANT NOTE: this is my way of trading from some years ago, but great that Robdee has post the indicator to help new people.  
  
Any question, just let me know.  
  
Happy thanksgiving day

Welcome lefteye, I agree it is a bit of a mystery how zigzag actually works.

hey i do not know if this will help but.. the zigzag draw lines at and in between extremes of price action. the defining factor in when or why a line is drawn is when price is greater then stated percent value.  
  
the depth is referred to as the minimal amount of bars that has to be drawn before the indicator is looking to draw a new line, thus creating lines in between a specified interval of bars.   
  
the third value that the zigzag uses has to do with the amount in pips that differs from the last point of the line. by definition, if this amount is exceeded a new line is drawn.  
  
  
i might have got something wrong though.. but if you or anyone else for that matter has any questions regarding this please do not hesitate to pm me. thank you

Have read through all your posts and really like this system.Have not traded it yet but have spent a bit of time going through sam seiden supply demand clips economics 101 he calls it and your strategy of a pull back to the no2 break makes a lot of sense in the supply demand concept. I am really looking forward to your ideas and will contribute where I can

G'day sako, welcome to the thread. Your input is welcome. Just this week I started summer school at Massey University studying economics. Learning to think like an economist is useful and relevant to trading.

The day after Thanksgiving called Black Friday in North America. Markets there very quiet as expected.

  1. London opened on growing volume and bearish bias.
  2. Bulls did little to defend 1.33
  3. Interesting drop in volume 12:15-1:15 GMT possibly lunch?
  4. Second target reached but not even 100 pips in the range today.

An odd enhancer is picking the setups that give the best probability of success  
Note the 2 setups on EUR .  
  
The first setup had a weak move away from the level and price did not move far from the breakout. Result was 1-2 the small 14pip move  
Granted a round number 1.3300 was in the way of the trade  
  
The second setup had a strong move from the level and price moved a fair distance before retracing back.   
A strong move away from the setup arrow implies a strong supply area (more sellers than buyers) which if price moves back too ,there should be more sell orders there. Result was the 1-2 approx 75 pip move down.  
  
Didnt take this trade was asleep nz time just for educational purposes

i like this idea so much. i did something similar two days ago. after seeing the 123 go short and i did have that one to.. i put another order in to sell at the old point 2, stop was 3 pips + spread. wouldn't you know it my order got filled, target at 78 something. who would not risk 1 to get 10 right? :-) another nice way to use 123s or the wording how 123s are useful.

hello robdee, your indicator works great with the current method im using, and i like its simplicity compared to what i currently use that draws lines instead of dots. can you help me on this, how or where can i adjust the parameters so that only the latest signals will be seen on the chart and the old plots will automatically erased?   
thank you in advance and more power to you.

Mabuhay frank  
  
My charts are what I call **Basic Setup**

  1. ShowAllLines = False
  2. ShowAllBreaks = False
  3. ShowTargets = False

You will also notice in my recent posts I have removed ZigZag (training wheels) from my charts.  
  
Anyone starting as a beginner with 123PatternsV6 should be using ZigZag to **train your eyes to see the patterns** rather than relying totally on my indicator.

First of all, a very big thankyou to Robdee for starting this thread and holding our hands to guide us through the strategy.  
  
I like this strategy based on price action using fibs as a confirmation tool.  
  
Is there any reason or restrictions, why this strategy (aggressive break of point 2 representing support or resistance) could not work on a 4 hour timeframe?  
  
I would like to incorporate the strategy with the CCI (for which I am very fond of). Any suggestions?  
  
BTW I am from NSW and just came back a month ago from my first trip to New Zealand on a cruise. Absolutely beautiful country! Dunedin was my favourite. I even took a photo of the stock exchange in Windy Welly. :-))

hey and welcome. i asked a similar question and got the answer that a cci is not part of this method. but i personally do want to use it in this setup. if you ask me it looks like often when the price is breaking or trying to break point 2 in a 123 pattern we will have a move in the cci(200)'s direction. as long as the cci is stronger then 100 that is.  
  
thoughts ?

good morning robdee, i hope somebody got this setup this morning could have given nice pips. anyway, if you look at the M15 chart is it possible that those plots will auto erase coz the one i use has a parameter that can be adjusted to show just the recent plots but it paints lines instead of dots? if not possible then no worries i think i just have to live with it ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/270c-fe0f.png?v=15.1)  
  
i missed this coz i was sleeping, darn! its really hard to trade in caribbean we are on eastern time. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f62d.png?v=15.1)  
  
thanks alot my friend

hey alrightfrank, can i ask you. is it true that you always take those aggressive breaks on the point 2 or is there some other criteria that you use? i do see these trades but i am reluctant to get in because i want to see the 123 and enter on the rh. as discussed in this thread in this week.  
  
can you explain please?

yes i do. it depends on your risk tolerance my friend dont take my opinion on this i could be wrong but this is how i operate. as i type this i entered an aggressive buy position, see the post.   
the thing is i hunt this setup on M5, though my chart is on M15. i can see clear setups happening on M5 and also considering the risk and reward ratio risk is smaller in M5.  
first thing, i belive in the system, it works most of the time not all the time. i know loosing is part of the game, ive learned to love it. so i enter the market without emotion once i see the setup and then let the market decide.

i always trade london sessions my friend, with this trade i just target for 10-15 pips.  
when i open a trade i always secure it to SL at breakeven +1 once it hit 25+ pips, i get out of trade if it hit .61, SR area or whenever i feel it needs to be closed.  
  
F  
  
i dont use fib to assist me on my entries, i just use it to calculate my targets.

G'day amochoc and welcome to the thread, glad you had a great cruise around NZ. The number of cruise ships visiting Tauranga increases every year. I was a university student in Dunedin back in the 80's, great Scottish region.

There is no technical limitation, the indicator is designed to work the same on all timeframes. The 123 break is a well known pattern. It is observed and _interesting_ to many big players in the 4 hour and daily charts. Of course you have to scale out your stops, targets, trade durations accordingly to trade on that level.

I also like CCI for overbought/oversold/divergent conditions on my 4H chart. I use CCI(14) with level markers pulled out to +/- 125.  
  
I am using 4H chart only for big picture overview, not for placing trades. 4H fibo areas are also very interesting, to observe price action at those levels.  
  
Look forward to your input.

i would be careful to go CT long my friend, theres still strong SR 1.34xx area, overall im still bearish. i only guess that theres still a chance for the market to visit 1.32xx level, as well as shoulder formation on near supply area. just my two cents ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61e.png?v=15.1)

Hi Robdee,   
  
Your indicator 123PatternsV6 is very usefull

Hi Rob  
  
First of all best of luck with the thread.  
  
The distorted pattern is a 2b trade, just google that and you'll see them clearly. They are the same general concept as double tops/bottoms and 1 2 3 trades i.e. a sign of test and failure at a key level. I don't trade all 2b i.e. distorted pattern trades, much more selective.  
  
Personally I feel once you have had the first 1 2 3 to change direction then you have a series of HH, Hl's and they are the same as 1 2 3's.  
  
Paulus I think it was did some great work re 1 2 3's coming out of Asian session into London. The idea of only taking trades counter to the direction from Asian session. This would take into account the notorious London open head fake concept avoid some losing trades and hopefully get into the main move of London session.  
  
Trading 1 2 3's at your zone prices is a very important concept, perhaps easily explained as support becomes resistance and vice versa.   
  
What else, I am very wary of taking (what I describe as) weak 1 2 3 moves very early in US session that counter the London direction. Often those small 1 2 3 patterns will fail and US session moves back into the London direction (often with a distorted pattern).  
  
All the best.

OK your other comments about not bogging down the thread with nice to have indi's.  
  
The trend is your friend, that old adage applies for a reason, well because it works. The consideration then becomes what do you use to describe as your trend. A very personal decision for many.  
  
MTF analysis then becomes important. One of the prolific EA writers at FF includes a standard option to take signals when the D RSI is below the 50 level. Thats a pretty good rule of thumb.   
  
Will this mean that some trades are missed when the D chart is turning, of course but should save many losing trades going against the D trend.  
  
How you get by avoiding losing trades on the odd counter daily trend days I have never figured out (as far as an EA goes), manually you can just avoid selling as an example on 5 min chart after a strong D hammer.

There are various indi's around that highlight SR levels, drawing lines at the identified levels. I've never used them but I'm sure they would assist.   
  
I almost hate to say it but its so simple. An 8 lwma after a retrace gives an easy visual of a 1 2 3. The red line is the clear buy zone/resistance became support. A positive close candle moving through the 8 lwma with little/no upper wick (for a buy) avoiding candles that are overly large (15 pips or so) is a method I've used for years.  
  
  
Also in this case the D has had a nice positive close and approaching (but not above its 50 RSI). Interestingly to put above posts into context. Price came out of Asian session lower so after a positive D close look for buys.  
  
How you code this goodness only knows.

If you were following the idea of going with D trend then on this day none of the buys would be tradeable as you are running against the D chart. More specifically the buy at 3530 has no clear buy zone for me, its run 50 pips to generate a buy (counter trend day) thats not a good idea.  
  
Interestingly enough the London close reversal played out like a charm, so you wouldn't be looking to sell at that time no matter how good the set up.  
  
The 1 2 3 buys in Asian session failed simply as Asian session just didn't want to buck the trend when volumes were light. Hindsight is a wonderful thing though.

As mentioned follow D trend, could use above/below its 8 rsi 50 level or right side of fozzy cross or whatever D filter you use to determine higher TF trend.   
  
Then look for trades at your buy sell zones that have a candle closing through 8 lwma in direction of higher TF trend.  
  
Very sorry if you are anti the indi's but the concept is solid.

Welcome Vantage, thanks for your input. You have a broad perspective on many elements of analysis which is valuable to consider in the context of this thread. I will have to go through your posts carefully step by step to evaluate where I can incorporate and then reply in more detail.  
  
I am _not_ against (anti) any indicators built-in to MT4. _I am against_ the many different _custom_ indicators and EAs available that would side-track this thread.  
  
I have only made brief comments about how I evaluate big picture (Daily trend). The focus so far has been basic interpretation of 123 patterns with fibonacci projections. I am trying to introduce as few variables as possible into the decision making process.  
  
Thanks again Vantage, your insights are always appreciated.

EURUSD  
London Open big volume did not break first bearish target, this was good evidence of bullish support.  
Bulls reacted to any price action below 50 fibo.  
Fed surprise announcement produced 200 pip bullish candle.  
Bears defense of 1.34 failed.

That is my interpretation of what happened today.  
I missed the bullish move because I kept thinking like a euro bear.

i would like to say something. the idea of using an indicator to assist ones perception of the price is something i like, though if it was possible i would like to be able to not have to use one. i suppose that i could claim i truly do not need my macd or cci.. but i ask you here, does anyone know of a way to not have to use an indicator like for example the cci?  
  
i am talking about not haveing to use it and still gettting that feeling of "oh okay here this move is greater then that, in force". perhaps it is just me overcomplicating things. but if anyone knows please advice.   
  
and i must add, i love the idea of the sell/buy zone, the ttl, and also the ross hook.   
  
ideas? comments?

One of the things the VSA threads taught me was cause and effect, the D chart had a doji 3 days ago then a shooting star. The failure of that shooting star to go lower may (and I'll say may, same as you thoughts were on lower) have given reason to look to buy.  
  
At the moment my simple thoughts are:  
  
a) possible rally in a downtrend, we can still go lower and price is right on a D sell zone  
b) if the market is convinced eur problems solved then this could be start of big move up, of course there could be some funny up and down days until that happens  
c) we have no divergence to confirm the move up  
  
So this D set up is one of those where I'd look at the chance to buy and sell whatever decent set ups happen from 5 min charts. As opposed to the recent sell only bias.

Rob there are a couple of threads now that trade using the TDI, I'm not sure of its make up but its very close to the old fozzy (theres nothing new in trading) 8 rsi with 8 sma on it.  
  
I have for a little while now been using higher TF fozzy crosses (as its a standard mt4 indi) as first hint of direction change (divergence a bonus) with above/below higher TF rsi 50 line as the 2nd confirmation of direction.  
  
Then using 5 min 1 2 3's (higher lows lower highs) as the entry method. Taking care with days like today where we could still go either way (my bias is up though) as the market might want a final shake out attempt lower.  
  
So I tried to filter the 1 2 3 set ups to my view of D chart.  
  
See one of prev posts, after up day (eur and gu) yesterday price came out of Asian session lower so that = buy bias.

hi there vantage, do you just base your directional trade in daily chart? and use rsi just for directional bias? how about H1 and H4, can we use this as well to base our directional bias to trade in M5?  
  
thanks alot

Hi Frank  
  
Perhaps a fine line here between going off topic and Robdees request to help fine tune 1 2 3 entries.  
  
Bias is D chart based, if you are going against that its one of those counter trend choices. You either accept the risk as being higher, perhaps lower your profit expectations (grab lower pips if in profit), or pass on the trade.  
  
Pls see above posts, we take certain 1 2 3 trades on 5 min if its in line with D trend without waiting for 1hr to fall in line. For example if (as has been the case now except the last day or 2) the GU, eur trend is down you are looking for sell opp's. A classic would be price moving higher out of Asian session we would not be looking to buy but waiting for a 2b/dble top/1 2 3 at the recent extreme of price that you are hoping is in a sell zone at an important level.  
  
If you miss that initial 1 2 3 trade at the recent price extreme then we would be looking to only trade after 1hr/4hr has lined up. In the case of a sell we would be looking for some kind of hesitation candle (on 1hr) eg doji, shooting star, close in lower half of candle OR 2 or more candles that are pos closes but fail to break higher out of the recent range.   
  
Long explaination of your question but waiting sometimes for D 1hr trend to fall in line is a solid way to trade.

Personal view is roughly 70% of the time pa will follow the D chart from 1 day to the next. Thats decent odds, you then need to say where will you get in. It might mean that if trend is down London might try and buck that and needs US vol's to turn market to fall in line with D. Bottom line you can STILL lose money if you are trading trend IF you are using small stops and NOT being careful with your entry.  
  
1 2 3's is a classic method to use to shake out efforts to go against the trend.

With the above in mind pls look again at chart in post 119.   
  
If you missed the distorted pattern buy (2b trade) around 5539 (the recent extreme of price) we would then be waiting for a 1hr close to look for a 1 2 3 buy at a higher level.

Following on from above post 11 hrs ago. As mentioned bias was up.  
  
D pos close yesterday, fozzy crossed up and on 50 line.  
  
Price comes out of Asian session dropping, but bias is up, so prob a London open head fake lower. See earlier post look to trade the reversal of direction of pa coming out of Asia time.  
  
1hr candle closes bouncing off the D pivot ie an important level, a pos close hammer, in the direction of D bias. So now my D and 1hr charts are agreeing. 5 min chart, red line shows close of 1hr hammer and 1 2 3 follows see arrow up.  
  
Couldn't get a better example of how I view 1 2 3 (higher low) trades.  
  
Oh also the first 15-20 mins after a 1hr close often brings the desired 1 2 3 trade.  
  
Oh almost forgot, look to left of 1hr chart, the hammer close is a move up from its buy zone.

Thanks to Vantage we are seeing more details of the relationship between higher and lower timeframes.  
  
I like to see what is happening on a **monthly scale** using the 4 hour chart.  
I use a **30 candle cycle** and during November this has been starting on Fridays.

As you can see I set CCI(30) to match the cycle.  
I stretch the O/S O/B lines out from the default to +/- 125.  
Apart from that it is just like my _Basic Setup with Fibo Targets_ I use on 5min charts.  
  
I hope this gives you something useful.

Hi david trader, your chart is easy to read. Any time you see price moving below point 3 that means the pattern is no longer valid, the sellers are too strong. If you see this then it is a good time to look for an exit.

Yes, wait for bearish 123 pattern and draw your sell zone.

Good question, that is the purpose of this thread to find answers.  
  
One simple way taught by Joe Ross is this.

  1. Wait for strong move up (60+), then look for bearish 123 at the top.
  2. Wait for strong move down, then look for bullish 123 at the bottom.

EURUSD  
Can't seem to get those bears out of my mind.  
Cost me -20 pips soon after the London Open.  
Looks like a good defense of 1.35 by the bears.

If the market is turning there are often a couple of days when the big guys turn off the sells, the rest of the market is still selling. IF this is a turn the big boys will start buying, they can't buy all at once they have too much ammo. So a turn will often have its own D 1 2 3 (with rsi divergence for those that watch it). We haven't seen those patterns yet.  
  
You traded a big pic 1 2 3, make your candles much bigger and you'll see the smaller 1 2 3's. IMHO after your entry there was a distinct 1 2 3 lower high which might have given warning of a failure to move up and you could have gotten out with a smaller loss, or IF you believe the market IS turning you'd need stop below the D's low.  
  
As Rob has mentioned we could easily be headed lower looking for a D dble bottom, 1 2 3 high before the move up really begins.

First of all a little story. Islander a superb trader, I asked him how he did so well trading 1 min time frames at certain specific times of day. He said 10,000 hours of chart time. He was looking back all the time to perfect his entry requirements and his methods.  
  
Moving on.   
  
Trend (and therefore ranging markets) are time frame dependent, what may be ranging on 4hr might give great opportunities on 1hr/5 min. Looking at the chart post 135. The market hasn't had a real pullback on D chart yet, no real 1 2 3. As some pullback is likely still I would look at the distance from high to low for that trade, the market has moved a long way to take an entry there on what is not yet a confirmed upward trend.  
  
Just my view, until trend is confirmed up on D chart I would be looking at lower time frames for opp's to get entries much closer to turn points.

Just showing as an example again in using MTF to assist in a trade.  
  
D yesterday had a doji that could not break Wed's high. This is the kind of candle we would look for to confirm a poss move down back into the trend.  
  
I hr red neg close candle with large upper wick, confirming the view of D candle.  
  
2 nice 1 2 3's follow.  
  
Now IF the market is headed up after all, then over next few days we would need to see a D 1 2 3 with a low around 1.3200 or above. Only TWT what happens. So now its back to sell mode until there is evidence on D chart of a 1 2 3 bottom.

Hi Robdee  
  
Can you advise if theres any change's to the 123 indicator if Iam to use it on say the 15min TF..or 1 hour.  
  
Iam running the indicator on 5 min at : zigzag 12, retrace depth min 0.4, retrace depth max 1.0  
  
Thankyou

G'day Glenn, welcome to the thread. Those 5min settings you are using are the same as my basic settings I use on 5min and 4hour. I expect that those settings will also work fine on 15 min and 1 hour. At least as a good baseline. I did a lot of tweaking last year trying to find better settings but never found anything more reliable than those defaults.  
  
ZigZag=12 makes sense on 5min because 12 candles = 1 hour.  
ZigZag=12 makes sense on 4hr because 12 candles = 48 hours.

Thanks Robdee..  
  
I lived in Auckland for 30 years before moving to Aussie....hows it going?  
  
Glad to see John got back in.  
  
I have studied 123, TTE and ross hook for years, so your indicator fits in well...  
  
Any advise on trading using the indicator would be of intrest....so far I have traded the setup for a few weeks on 5 min...in the first few hours of london session and so far 100% winners...  
  
Thanks

Hi Rob  
  
Thanks for your efforts here. I am not in a position to watch the indi live at the moment. My apologies then for any stupidity that follows as a result.  
  
I have shown the 8lwma and fozzy 8 rsi with 8 sma overlay just to compare your indi with what I would typically be looking for.  
  
OK first chart shows red line where 1 hr closed in line with my view of daily. So from there the bias is negative. PS I became indi averse but put fozzy back on for divergence as I found that helped with distorted trades, then the co-incidence of solid set ups with fozzy crosses became apparent.  
  
Second chart shows the areas where I would be looking to get in. You'll see that on the right hand trade I would have been looking to enter 1 candle earlier.  
  
EA suggestions for discussion:  
  
1) Is it feasible to have options to take a view of the market and have sell only, buy only, show all trades? That way if you have the time you could look at computer at close of 1hr candle and see if confirms view of market and choose (in these charts as an example) sell only after the red line 1hr close. Therefore you could avoid some poss fake out sells when 1 hr had not yet 'flipped' over in line with the daily. I have purposely not asked this question earlier, I wanted to post a few charts with HTF's lining up so you would now see what I was thinking.   
  
2) In the 2nd pic after close of 1hr the left red line shows where I'd be looking to enter (close of candle that has opened above closed below the 8lwma, fozzy crossed lower nice to have) 1 pip or so below the close of the candle. In this case as candle closed below 2 point EA agrees.  
  
The right red line, I'd be looking to enter 1 candle before the EA. That's about a 20 pip difference in entry, it didn't hurt this time but often that size later entry as you know could be the diff between success and failure. Is it feasible to code an option where if candle closes (for a sell in this case) with little/no lower wick (I use ballpark 3 pips), close to (but above) the orange red line at point 2 (again say ballpark 3 pips) that trades would be signalled when 2 point is broken with 1 pip?  
  
I trust that this is clear.  
  
Cheers.

Only the retracement, with a entry as per TTE....so Iam in the trade before point 3...  
well I try to be, doesnt all ways work as per the plan...  
  
I also work out a TP based on point 2 minus point 3....the balance multiply by .618...  
  
Sorry I dont have a lot of time to spend in forums...  
  
**EDIT** sorry point 2

hey and welcome to the thread :-)  
  
i would just like to comment. i do the same on entry, see the break of point 2, watch for the TTE zone and have orders there to take me in at that point.  
  
however i do calculate the distance of TP differently. taking the distance from point 2 to point 3 as the target, from point 2. as such if my TTE zone   
equals rr 1:3 or greater on that trade i will take it.   
  
example: TP is 30 from point2, TTE zone says i risk 15 until point 3 then that is risking 15 to get 45 hence 1 for 3.   
if the case is that my TP is greater then 30 as point2 would be another value then i consider that as an even greater opportunity and strongly consider moving my target even further, as per always keeping my 1 for 3 mentality. greater is only bonus though, hope you understand this :-)  
  
as for the part where it does not always work i do this; if the cci(200) is > 100, on long side in this example, at the point 2 of the 123 pattern then that point 2 is acceptable. if not then it isn't. this thinking can be applied differently with other indicators set to other numbers. it is just something i've found to be working for the moment and it is only my interpretation. i think somebody wrote about it in this thread also, though i cannot find it atm.

Hi Guys,  
Great thread, I use a 123 break pattern along with CCI and a 60sma, really only looking to trade with the sma for direction and CCI for confirmation.  
I find H4 suits my life style but applies to all time frames, just make sure the sma is in agreement one time frame higher.

Thanks for that...I will look at your CCI method....do you change the cross line " 100" or cci(200) for different TF's...  
I was refering to the TTE ideal of three candles then the turn....fourth candle contiunes then the move will contiune...  
Therefore its not always possible to get the three candles before the retracement zone...  
So Iam intrested in looking at the CCI setup.  
  
Sorry if this is off thread Robdee  
Thanks

Here is an example of my Basic Setup with Fibo Targets and CCI(144) on 5min charts.  
CCI(144) represents a 12 hour cycle so fits the **intraday** scenarios well.  
  
With Fibos, CCI, and TTE this is getting more significantly more advanced than simple setups I've posted previously.

**Note: Click on this chart (3-times in Firefox) to see full size image**  
  
In Friday's scenario 4:30GMT was the optimal entry.  
  
Assuming a bullish trend, I look for a pullback into oversold (CCI below -125).  
Then I'm looking for a TTE entry that allows me to enter before the next point 2 is broken.

Rob any chance you could make you charts clearer with some thicker cci lines and darker colours.  
  
For what its worth I'll post same charts with 2 of the set ups we use.  
  
Pls note the diff in pips when market goes from counter trend back to trend.

2 of the basic set ups we'll trade.  
  
3 ma's nicely stacked. I have shown the candles we'd like to trade when they close as they have positive closes with little/no upper wick. They are counter trend to the daily down trend. They were close to the round number so would probably pass.  
  
In both trades we would be looking to get into before 2 point broken. Going counter trend could really be the diff between win/BE or a losing trade. Pls see previous post of mine, any chance you could code to get entry earlier?

2nd set up. 1hr has given us a good candle to now suggest counter trend move up is over. So we are now selling rally in a down trend with a decent 1hr candle confirming poss move down in line with D trend.  
  
Left red line our entry and ea agreeing as 2 point has been broken. Ma's not nicely stacked but we have our 2nd basic trade (1hr agreeing with D trend).  
  
Right red line we would look for entry 1 candle before the ea. Ea didn't signal as 2 point not yet broken. Again any chance of coding a neg close candle with little/no lower wick that is close to 2 point but hasn't yet closed beyond 2 point as a trade?  
  
The diff in pips between this trend and the above counter trend trades is really clear.  
  
Sorry Rob I have just shown the ma's etc not to move the direction of thread but just to show what we would look for in set ups. Not intending any of these to be brought in. The 1 2 3 indi appears to be working very well just trying to get a focus between trend and counter trend.

We wouldn't be looking for bullish trend just yet. We closed below Thur's low.  
  
Until we now get a D candle that closes pos to confirm a D 1 2 3 move up we will be working on the assumption that this leg down on Fri is the 1st of a typical 3 leg down move.  
  
So again any pos 1hr candles in Asian session on Mon we would consider opp's to sell rally in down trend. Dare I say it, Asia moving up into London open we would look at as a LO head fake opp to sell.  
  
1 step further any move to Thurs low would be a HTF sell zone. The 2 red lines show our sell areas.

since robdee already explained it nicely i'll use his latest picture to illustrate my thoughts on this.  
  
point a shows the bar that broke point 2, 1 pip above this bar is where aggressive entry would be.   
  
point b shows where tte zone would be and as such tell me to enter as it is where the bar that broke point 2 started to form.  
  
also notice down below on his cci, that is scratching the 125 level and im sure it would be also if i'd pull up a chart with it set to cci(200) @ 100.  
  
  
thank you :-)

Start of a new week, I'm trying to change my mind to think like a Euro Bull.  
  
Using 123 analysis and 50 fibo makes **1.3326** look interesting for bulls.

hi bit difficult to be bullish when the chart is showing downtrend, but being open really helps in short term trading  
  
being open to all possibility mean u capture more pips  
  
e.g. euro only gone down 300 pip in last 5-7 weeks or so but most of the move down was only on a few candles. if you miss the move you really dont have much of a downtrend thats why i prefer scalping as it works in ranges which it certainly has done after the big move - ranging very tightly.

We'll see, 1hr shows 2nd leg down but we couldn't go below fri's low. That could just be Asian habit of not wanting to push through levels. There is some rsi divergence showing. D shows a nice shooting star.  
  
It could turn any where here or down to 3200, who knows, why guess. the D chart will tell soon - perhaps.

Basic 123 analysis yielded zero pips in this session.  
  
**Conclusion:** 123 analysis in consolidating ranges is of limited value. This is exactly what Joe Ross (Ross Hook,TTE inventor) teaches. He says wait for a strong move up or down first, then look for evidence of an opposing entry using 123.

Hi Rob  
  
Sorry I would disagree strongly here. The zig zags for your 1 2 3 chart above post are too wide.  
  
The indi from your 1st post worked fine.  
  
D chart shows some clear S levels around 3300. 1hr chart shows a hammer with divergence at 3300.  
  
5 min hl's as per your indi that i downloaded are clear. A superb day.

With some basic chart analysis as above your 123patternsV6 indi (settings as standard zigzag depth 1, retrace depthmin 0.4, retrace depthmax 1.0) is fantastic.  
  
The question is why are you not focused on what that indi is showing?  
  
Thats where I think you are onto a winner.

Same chart cleared of pivots and psych levels. Trades are clearly shown. How about developing this further into a full trade ea and lets put this up for demo trading.

In a very sideways week the 123PatternV6 did a fantastic job. The arrows up and down are created by the system.  
  
I'd like to see an option to take trades earlier at break of 2 point, or at least an alert if price approaches to x number of pips before 2 level.  
  
With a stop 2/3 pips + spread beyond the 1 point (ie the last swing high low) you can see for yourself how many winners v losers there are.   
  
The first 1 2 3 trade will always be the safest.   
  
Rob I strongly believe you are onto something here.   
  
Mondays London + US session.

Ok this is not telling me anything I didn't expect I've been trading 1 2 3's (higher lows lower highs) for years. I am amazed how well this indi performs picking up the swings in a rotten sideways week.  
  
Rob I would look to try and enter trades where candles have little/no wick (in direction of trade) but haven't yet crossed the 2 point. See the x trade, the indi showing trade on candle that crosses and closes below 2 point around 3362. I'd be looking to enter 3375 ish with the candle before which closes just above the 2 point but with little/no lower wick (when selling of course).

Hi  
Due to business interests I am not able to watch charts live at the mo (which is why I'd love to get a usable 1 2 3 ea) so cannot comment on repaint. Robdee is very experienced and I don't think that he'd miss that one. The arrow shows after a candle closes past the line at the 2 point.  
  
With wicks provided the body is much bigger than the wick I have used up to 3 pips wick, of course the smaller the better.

Vantage is correct in saying that the arrow prints after a candle closes beyond price point 2. The indicator is always looking back in time at the last three price points to see if they make a valid 123.

Valid 123 patterns may later be rendered _invalid_ by price action that exceeds the bounds of the original 1 2 3.  
  
Also, distorted patterns (ie ShowAllBreaks=true) leads to redraw/repaints at times.  
See previous posts on this topic...

  1. Arrows and distorted patterns [Post #49](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5155407#post5155407)
  2. 123 setup becoming invalid [Post #1113](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=4138391#post4138391)

These are known limitations and are all being taken into account with the next version V7 which is currently in testing by myself and another trader.  
  
Vantage suggestions for fine tuning entry options are appreciated and will be added in V7.  
  
The logic used in V7 will not be complicated. It will be less complicated than V6. The logic for finding and acting on 123 patterns will essentially be the same as Vantage's recent posts.  
  
I have a solid and proven EA code base so it will not be difficult to build an EA for this.

Thanks vantage for posting the weeks charts with your 123 settings I have changed the zigzag depth from 12 to 1 as you said and it looks really good in fact really really really good.

Hi Rob  
Just an example of aggressive entry on the pm I sent you. Here entry would be just below 3400, as opposed to waiting for 2 point to break. Just wanted to give you visual of the 1st neg close candle in trend move.  
  
Thanks for your work here.

hey Vantage that dashed "v" you marked on the chart is exactly where i would enter with my rr 1:3 as i told you in my pm. this "v" point illustrates it perfectly; a bigger 123 shown a few bars earlier and then an entry at a bit better price going short.   
  
just saying.. you think differently and find the entry in another way, but we both find the same place to go in. makes me feel good :-) i am so on this train guys!

here is a picture of what i mean. i made up the difference from point 2 to point 3 and set it to 10. i have not measured it because that does not matter for what i am about to show.  
  
on one side there is a trade with 10 pips risk for a possible gain of 10 pips. it is an rr of 1:1. on the other side there is an example of another trade with the same stop and target, though the entry is higher up giving us a better price. the entry i prefer here is the 1:3 where i am risking 5 to get 15.   
  
who wouldn't right?? i am just saying :-) now you can see my point, hopefully.

Yes you often get a smaller 1 2 3 after a bigger one and is a great place to enter. Aggressive entry before the traditional break of 2 point, it is well documented.  
  
Like I have said before when selling I typically look for 1st neg close candle that has little/no lower wick and enter when candles low is broken with a pip (or so).   
  
If in this example you take entry at the top of the hammer is that entry based on a fib of the 1 2 range? Just want to be totally clear on what you are looking for.

Rob to be clear when selling 1st neg close after 3 point in a traditional 1 2 3.

i am looking for a 123 setup and then i calculate where the entry "50% between 2 and 3" is, put my order there if it fits my other criterias.

Vantage, emb  
  
Your recent charts and discussion are very helpful, great work! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
I see three options for aggressive entry _before_ the break of point 2.  
  
1) Vantage's **candle that closes with very little wick** (ie not much opposite pressure) and occurs after price point 3 and before price point 2 has been broken. This provides a consistent approach to aggressive entry.  
  
2) emb's entry line **"50% between 2 and 3"** providing better R:R ratio and another consistent approach to aggressive entry.  
  
3) My favourite, **"50% between 1 and 2"** followed by preparing to exit/reverse on 210% (aka Fibo Targets).  
  
See the case study that we have all been posting from 6 December...

123Patterns**V6** shows the dots and arrows _too late_ to suit the aggressive entry methods mentioned above.  
  
I am working on **V7** which will include some way of showing aggressive entries _as they occur_.

Here is a preview of V7 showing 'Vantage style' entries on that same day (6 Dec).

robdee that v7 looks very promising. is it too much to ask of the new v7 version to have a automatically calculating line of set % for my entry? i am thinking a box where you input how much pullback in % and then v7 draws a line at that point, calling it meatball or w/e.. could be useful for other people also, one might want to enter on a 20% pullback and another trader maybe likes 40% or so.  
  
understand me? ideas?? all the best so far ! :-)

Hello robdee,  
  
This is excellent thread, I was looking for something like this last months, especially I like emb's entry line "50% between 2 and 3" providing better R:R ratio.I think, this is very promising and long story.

Hi emb, sure no problem, I am very busy this week with mid-semester exams. Later in the week I will be working on it. Something like 23RetraceLine=0.50 is what I' thinking. _Robdee_

Traders may like to do some V7 beta testing?  
  
I am very busy this week so I will just post this and then carry on with my other work for a few days.  
  
New ideas...

  1. V7 focuses on aggressive entries, it does not wait for the break.
  2. Filters are used to avoid too much chaos
  3. CCIFilter prevents _buy_ entries when CCI grossly overbought (smoothed cci > 125)
  4. CCIFilter prevents _sell_ entries when CCI grossly oversold (smoothed cci < -125)
  5. VolFilter prevents _all_ entries when volume is below average.
  6. Below average volume is defined as MA12(fast) < MA144(slow).

We can see here you use ZigZagDepth=1, did you change this from 12 or it will remain 12?   
Thank you in advance.

Congratulations:   
  
I think this is the most interesting thread on FF at this time. Very practical approach to problem solving; with some good, sharp, minds on the task.  
  
My request:  
  
I would love to hear a distinct alert sound for a buy and a different sound for a sell. When all alerts sound the same, it is a tad frustrating.  
  
I use Chin bars to alert me to breakouts and I just recently figured out how to have a bullish sound or a bearish sound alert from the same indicator. Given my level of ability with programming, that is probably not too complex for the wizards here. If it is a new thought, I can show anyone how to do it.  
  
Different alert sounds would be a nice feature to add to the 123 indicator. I have found that this enhancement in Chin Bars is quite beneficial.  
  
On another tack:  
  
Personally, I find Zig Zag indicators a bit hit or miss and I prefer to do my own higher-high, higher-low plots (and vice verse) based on fractals. I know that is probably a whole new slant on this as zigzag is the core, but maybe keep it on the back burner.   
  
Great work in progress here.

He's busy and I know for a fact Rob changed it. The bigger 12 missed many 1 2 3's.

There isn't an indi that will get everything the way your eye will. Over the last few weeks the 123PatternV6 has shown itself to be quite amazing. Just looking over last weeks trades shows the ability it has. Thats the point, how many solid trades can we get.  
  
You might want to compare your fractals to the 123PatternV6 and V7 (NOT the zig zag 12 setting) and if the proof is there I'm sure Rob will consider it.

I totally agree that we should be able to know when the indicator is not doing the job correctly. Counting 123, or higher-highs, higher-lows etc. is something we can learn to do well on our own. A good indicator can help us with that, especially with the learning curve.   
  
I like what is developing here and have no desire to hijack it in any way. I use123 and also use the fractals idea and I like both. Often they are one and the same.   
  
Having said that, I have attached a reasonably good fractal zigzag that may or may not prove useful. It attempts to meld zigzag with fractals and seems to do a reasonable job. I only post it here as it may help with this project.

Keep up the good work my friend, you most certainly are onto a good indicator here, I've attached it to my Range Bar chart and I'm liking the way it looks. It's very similar to what I look at when I'm looking at H/L, L/H price patterns.  
  
If I was to use something like this I would be looking at using it for trend continuation entries, and less for counter trend set ups.  
  
However saying that I can certainly see potential for reversal patterns.  
  
Just take a quick look at this chart, don't pay too much attention to the other indicators on the chart, these are for my trading setups.  
  
I've circled areas on the chart according to your signals that would tell me that there's a possible change in trend coming.  
  
This would be indicated by a L/H or H/L, count the 1.2. H/L L/H circles and you can see what I mean.  
  
Also you can see what would be the continuation signals.  
  
Very well done my friend.

Another example of what I'm talking about, you can clearly see the areas on the chart where a change of price direction is indicated.  
  
Giving early possible signals. Obviously you will get false signals however, after a fake reversal signal a trend continuation is the next signal.

xx50 to xx00 level.. typical price action movement...  
  
You can see the first L/H as indicated, this is the ideal scenario for an entry.

Nice thread, robdee : well done (thanks for the heads up, Mr V).  
  
I like 123 setups and my personal trading "search for the Holy Grail" has for a long time been how to enter on a reject of the 3 point. This morning's first trade is a reasonable example (6E = EU futures / 5 tick range bars / CET chart time) : I hope it's self-explanatory.  
  
First Monday morning trade is potentially tricky, especially when the market has been trending quite strongly overnight (I start at 0900). I sold a reject of the volatility stop : entry 1 tick below the close of the bar. First contract hit t1 @ +13, c2 back to b/e +1.  
  
PS. Sorry not showing thread indicators ... but my point is about the pattern, not about indicators (& my platform is NinjaTrader)

+32 pips on my short using my strategy  
  
2 x risk on the trade  
  
Putting your indicator on the chart I use you can see how it compared entry basically the same spot.

Again more repainting issues with the (3) symbol on the chart... must be a reason for this... will make visual backtesting virtually useless.

I haven't had chance to play yet. Rob said he will put in some filters that can be switched off to leave decision to traders.   
  
The indi was actually doing a great job to signal a valid 1 2 3 at the round number. The fact that it was counter trend is something for the trader to decide whether he wants to take or not.  
  
Just apply your own filter (ie keep your hand off the button) and only take trend signals (unless of course its around London close then you can look at counter days trend trades).

hi. please remember that the v7 is in testing phase and as such is not always working as intended.  
  
one thing you could do to filter which side of the trades you want to take is to use a slow moving macd next to your chart. i personally like to use the cci to measure force but there are many oscillators/momentum indicators that you could use.  
  
edit: vantage beat me to it :-)

Thought I would chime in because I use supply and demand to trade and saw sell and buy zones so figured worth a read. Very interesting thread with some great minds in here. I am by no means close to a pro as I am a student just like most on here. I still make the bone headed mistakes and prolly more than most because I try to predict rather than go with the flow.  
  
So I posted this pic of what i see why it failed. And remember i am not picking on you just letting you know why go long? I make these same mistakes still at times and dont want to see you lose like i did and still do. Basically dont make a bad habit because I am fighting through mine right now.  
  
Also on your chart if you did take that trade you had a chance to get out of it with some gain. If you take a countertrend keep your stop tight and if you do get in profit early move stop to breakeven and let it ride. Hey if it goes your way then congrats you found the turning point , if not you lost nothing. Where you want to move a stop to BE is up to you. I know some at 5 pips move it and some at 15 pips. Up to you but remember when taking a CT its very very very risky. Keep your stop TIGHT.  
  
If you stick with the original indie and play tops and bottoms looking for zones with the arrow you will be fine. Just realize where the trend is. Ask yourself did this swing make a higher high or lower low? If it made a higher high and retraces back to your arrow on the indie then you have a better shot of a winning trade. If it didnt you may get something out of it but look close to where it may stall. Same goes for a lower low. Just a few mistakes I have done and still do from time to time.   
  
Good luck fellas and ladies.

my friends, pls let it be known to all of us that we cannot rely 100% on indicators alone to base our trading decisions, like "red dot sell, blue dot buy" first thing we have to know is how the indi works and why. if im not mistaken vantage had already threw out something about trading with the main trend of the day. its already shouting sell! sell! sell! from the begining of London session, therefore if we go long the crowd will be against us.   
i had a false signal on my platform as well like yours and the pic below, but the main idea is to learn to hunt 123 pattern nakedly and have the indi confirm it if it will have its chance, and still i will keep this great indi on my chart coz its doing its job.

this is what i mean, even the indi give false signal the main trend is always dominant, and still the indi is doing its job.

You answered your own question in your question.... downtrend... do not go long in a downtrend... very low probability

I have some ideas for indi signal filter:

  1. I must have more than 1 candle in between 1 and 2 and 2 and 3
  2. The pull back or rally from 2 to 3 must reach the 31.8 of the 1 to 2 move

I wanna from rob to appriciate itemes above to indi parameters change

Version 7 is a work in progress and I seek to add ideas that may improve it.  
  
I believe it is critical to identify the LL, LH, sequence using fractals.   
  
I have added the fractal zigzag to the chart to help illustrate what I believe are the more important 123 patterns. The fractal zigzag is a guide only, but a useful one. It is not perfect.  
  
To me, the critical 123 patterns should be based on LL, LH, fractals and I have shown that sequence on the chart. So these particular LL, LH, locations are based on fractals.   
  
I did not add the fractal indicator as it clutters the chart. With a bit of practice you can easily locate fractals on your own and establish the LL, LH, sequence. Same withe fractal zigzag, the human eye is much better at locating these things, but indicators help with the learning curve.  
  
Price rises to probe the down trend line and then falls back to make a 123 pattern that I identified with black numbers. Point 3 is a pullback of 50%. The Fibonacci projection (green) is used on my black 1 2 3 (fractal) points to calculate a 161.8 target which is 1.3 pips away from the 50% entry.  
  
Version 7 locates so many nice 123 patterns but if we could have to option of locating 123 based on fractals I think it would add a powerful component. I believe it could filter out a lot of the confusing situations.  
Identifying the LL, LH, sequence on the fractals (and HH, HL, in a bullish trend) is very powerful.   
  
Can it be done with zigzag, fractal zigzag or another way altogether? I am not a programmer but if it can be done, I think that adding 123 fractals to the method would worth exploring.  
  
My two cents worth. Please look at the attached chart.

if you ask me today is a chop/flat/news day. it will be interesting to see how the indicator does today.   
  
i would also like to point out that some of us might not want to hear both the sounds, when the price breaks a level and when the sound draws an arrow on the chart. if you ask me about that i would like an option to only hear either or both these sound alerts. if its not much to ask ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)

I have made changes to the **123PatternsV7** _beta_ code.  
  
Option now exists to **show only Bulls** or **only Bears**.  
Used when trader has decided market is trending and does not want to see opposing entries.  
  
To hide the Bulls set **ShowBulls=False** (eg in a downtrend)   
To hide the Bears set **ShowBears=False** (eg in an uptrend)   
  

Inserted Code
    
    
    Notes           = "BETA TEST EURUSD M5 Setup"
    ShowBears       = True
    ShowBulls       = True
    ShowStatus      = True
    ShowDots        = False
    VolFilter       = True
    VolMaFast       = 12
    VolMaSlow       = 144

Other changes:

  1. **ZigZag is gone!** This is what was causing most of the repaint issues.
  2. CCIFilter is disabled, Have not seen much benefit in this filter.
  3. Status for time of entry, price of entry, pips moved above/below
  4. Status for daily range, average daily range, and DR/ADR ratio
  5. Status for ratio of last candle volume compared to average volume

See attached file below version 20111214 and the matching template.

This is bound to be a really dumb question but then I am IT illiterate - the chart shift triangle doesn't show on your template and I can't work out how to get it there. Chart shift is enabled in the properties.

Welcome handy148, you are right, to make the triangle visible go to Charts.Properties.Colors.Grid and set it to a visible colour.

Hi davidtrader, yes you are correct.  
  
V7 signals show **both lines** (buy and sell) coming from the body of the signal candle.  
  
The idea here is suppose you have a sell signal and then later price breaks above the buy line. This is a good time to close the short and maybe change to a buy. (instead of just waiting to get stopped out)  
  
Another way to think of the two lines is a **sell zone**. As long as price does not close above the sell zone then it remains valid. If two candles close above the zone then it is broken - no longer valid.   
  
When this occurs the sell zone often becomes a buy zone. (resistance becomes support)  
  
Hope that answers your question.

With all this focus on V7 and the 5min charts I have been neglecting the big picture. So today I had another good look...  
  
Nothing new really, the **same big bearish 123-breaks are still in force**.  
  
Not even the big FED surprise could reverse that. They tried, they got all those central banks to agree, the media hype was awesome, and their timing was very good. However, as engineer [Scotty](http://www.google.co.nz/search?q=star+trek+scotty) reminds the captain, "_Ye cannae change the laws of physics!_ " ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1).  
  
I have tweaked my **30-bar cycle** to be slighty more accurate at **31-bars**.  
These cycles have been reversing on Fridays for the past couple of months.  
  
One reason to keep 123PatternsV6 is because it is useful giving me the easy to read 123 analysis I want on the 4-hour chart.  
  
See below...

Interesting theory, will see how it goes .. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) My only concern is bullish divergence in oversold area that just created.

Hi every body  
**why we dont set zigzag depth in 123v7 to 12?** if we set zigzag depth=12 some false signal will filter  
i ask this question because robdee analyses with zigzag depth 12 in any pic?

hi rob  
Thanks for new verion of 123v7 but I do prefer the first one with the ability to set the zig zag depth have been playing with the zig zag depth and 8 looks really good especially on the higher time frames eg 1hour

Hi sako, thanks for your feedback. I'm always glad to hear a different point of view. I have been putting so much effort into overcoming ZigZag's repaint issues that I have been overlooking the merits of ZigZag. Yes it does have merits.  
  
Another indicator I have written uses ZigZagDepth=8 and it appears to be a very effective level of filtering. I also agree with what you say about higher TFs that is why I use **V6 on 4 hour chart**.  
  
The higher the ZigZagDepth number the more little insignificant peaks are filtered out. This allows us to focus our attention on the larger, more significant, more powerful price points.  
  
**How much filtering is appropriate?**  
  
This is always problematic, some people want to see every possible trade highlighted on their screen. Others are happy seeing only a select few high probability trades. I am in the latter group, so very selective filtering is my usual preference.

hi rob  
Im not sure the repaint is much of an issue when you have an area of interest say on the 1hour frame just drop down to a lower time frame eg 15 min or 5 min to refine your entry it would soon be come clear whether that point of interest on the say 1hour is going to go the way you want  
I have been trying to see how much the indy repaints on 1min to see if it is a problem  
does it repaint often or is it only occassionally you have a better idea  
From what i can see at the moment it looks pretty good rob

**This happens when I release Beta code.**  
  
People ask me, _why are you still using the old version ?_

Answer: I have been using the old version for a _long time_ , I _know_ it works.  

Answer: The new beta code is for testing only. It needs to be tested over a period of 2-3 months. It is just a development tool for new ideas. It is like playing with stuff to see how it works. I do like the look of it but I am not very confident about it.  

**Are you wondering which version to use V6 or V7 ?**  
  
Keep in mind that **V7 is beta test only** , I have no idea how consistent it will be over the long term. The focus of V7 is on early aggressive entries (before the break of 2) so this is not really following strict 123-break methodology.  
  
**V7** _seems to fit_ the last few days of price action by passing a large number of potential entries through a series of filtering rules. **It seems to fit because I made it fit**. Only a few of those many potential entries make it through the filters and are displayed. (If you want to visualise this filtering set ShowDots=True). Now we need to wait and see if it continues to perform without me doing any more fitting.  
  
**V6** is my tried and tested old faithful 123-break indicator that has been around for more than a year. You can control the level of filtering with ZigZagDepth and if you can put up with a few ZZ repaint issues then it will suit many applications.  
  
**Final note** , if you cannot clearly identify 1 then 2 then 3 with 2 pointing in the direction of the trade then it is not 123 analysis, it is something else.  
  
Hope that helps. I get frustrated when I post Beta test code and some people start treating it like a production release. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61f.png?v=15.1)  
  
Maybe I should call it [Alpha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Alpha) code for testing, I don't know.  
  
Anyway, enough said.

Thanks for your reply  
Just to clarify I like this 123v7 first version for the reasons Ive posted.I am really impressed with what you have done and iam trying to learn as much as i can from this thread . From other threads I see a lot of people knocking indicators because they repaint and they throw the baby out with the bath water this is not a perfect game and there will never be a perfect indicator  
but what you have developed here is really something i like a lot. This 123 indy is new to me and Im trying to get to grip with the boundries of how it may be useful and share any positive results thanks for your effort and sharing rob

David, those are OHLC prices for the current candle.  
OHLC means open high low close.  
See [this page](http://www.babypips.com/school/types-of-charts.html) for an explanation of OHLC candles.

Hi Robdee,

From a visual perspective it gives confidence in the trend and where it may be finishing. Hope the charts are self explanatory 5min chart then 1min chart of the move

EURUSD  
London started with a tricky bullish pullback lasting 2 hours.  
All had calmed down by 10:30 with a continuation of the downtrend.  
V6 based fibo targets worked as expected. Day's low hit at 16:00.

Note: Following that period of choppy consolidation I experimented with stop hunting. Today I shifted the lowest buy zone down 25 pips and the highest sell zone up 25 pips to observe stop hunters. This is shown above.

The only trade I took (on this system) was 10:30 gmt short. Bearish trend too strong to look at longs imo.

Put the latest version of 123v7 on to see how it worked around the breakout in the post 225 I did.  
Worked well   
Great being able to turn bulls and bears off keeps chart clean when looking for the entry  
This is looking promising Rob but as you say give it the test of time  
PS Have both 123v7 indicators on chart first for the zigzag 8 setting second version 123v7 for testing entries

The lines keep printing until a new signal prints, the new signal then 'takes over' the lines at the new level.  
  
Sometimes I will draw a rectangle to extend out the zone further to see what happens later on.

Hi Jurn_e,  
  
I see you use a fixed target (like I''ve seen you doing before in another thread), do you also use a fixed stop in testing?

Nope. I don't have a fix stop.  
We can discuss it in the other thread on stops.

OK, can discuss it there. Let me just share yesterday's session (around London opening). Normally I woudn't trade a 1:1 or lower RR and the question in the long run is: what is the hitratio/reliability for this 123pattern. I've seen chart examples for larger swing trades using fibo, I see you using your favorite 10pips and for me the stoploss is important and in that sense also the RR. I usually pick the last swing h/l for my SL... In the attached picture the SL (red) and Target (green) are set 1:1. Sure, yesterday was a nice chart to pick and what would we do with reversing signals, close and reverse?   
  
I like this 123pattern in combination with the aggressive v7. Will demo it for now. Thanks again rob!

EURUSD  
Before London, Asia found support along 1.29 _80_ (50 fibo)  
London Open picked up the bullish push at 1.3000  
This lasted only 1/2 an hour reversing at 1.3035 (fibo target)  
**Four hours of battle** found support on 1.29 _90_ (another 50 fibo)

I did not have confidence in the bulls.  
I found two small bearish 123-breaks that I could sell with V7 (called 'sell' above).

My chart is a bit different to yours - different broker perhaps but I have a red candle followed immediately by a blue sempahore 3 which I don't see on your chart.

hello robdee. nice system. were there some longs there? it was a positive session for euro  
  
are you waiting for the break of 2 low, or going in a bit earlier with better risk reward

Hey Rob,  
  
Thanks for your efforts I´m following this thread since the beginning.  
  
I would like to suggest you to put a vouch filter on it to avoid the noise, it seems like a lot of people just don´t get that this is about testing an Indicator. Not sharing a system.  
  
Cheers.

hi musashi, actually counter trend rallies are noted for their ferocity and speed, as well as catching those short very well. counter trend rallies can be the most powerful of all moves in the financial market.

Hi handy, the (3) dots show me you are using the original V7 beta. That original used zigzagdepth=1, a cci filter, and (3) dots. That older version can be found in [post #202](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5213263#post5213263).  
  
The newer heavily modified version (no zigzag, no cci filter, no (3) dots) can be found in [post #235](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5219503#post5219503).  
  
I think that explains the difference in our charts.

Welcome Halba, good questions, yes I agree there are longs, if I had more confidence in the bulls I would have been buying right on the 50 fibos. I use V6 dots to draw the fibos from point 1 to 2. I then look for price action to show respect to the 50 fibo.

With V7 beta there will be times when the entry shows _before_ the break of 2. That is OK, that is how it is designed. Just need to make sure that all three points are visible 1 2 3, then V7 painted candle, enter the trade. It is also OK if the entry _appears_ after the break of 2. The R:R will not be quite so good but it is still a valid entry imo.  
  
I gave up trying to get the indicator to number the dots because there is so much overlap, bulls vs bears, and true vs distorted. This means it is **actually better for the operator to figure out** where the 123 price points are. I label them manually as the intraday chart unfolds. V6 gives a good hint because it drops coloured dots on the more obvious 123s.  
  
Hope that helps. Trade well.

Thanks for that.  
  
One thing I noticed this morning (just now in fact) is that a short red line suddenly extended across 4 further candles and a red down arrow appeared 4 candles back.

Hi David, your chart looks good.  
Nice to see someone (other than me) using fibo targets. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
See my analysis below (using V6 only).

Option 1 (more safe)

  1. 1 2 3 break (red arrow)
  2. draw fibo 1-2
  3. now place order on 50 fibo

Option 2 (safe)

  1. 1 2 3 (no wait for break)
  2. draw fibo 1-2
  3. wait for Vantage signal candle (small wick)
  4. now place order on 50 fibo

Option 3 (more risk)

  1. 1 2 (no wait for 3)
  2. draw fibo 1-2
  3. now place order on 50 fibo

Note: 123PatternsV6 will not show the 123 dots until the break has happened. So either you find your own 123's (eg with ZigZag) or you wait for the break. V6 makes Option 1 easy.

I prefer to see a candle rejecting 3 point and closing with little/no wick in direction of trade.  
  
Rob highlighted the 2b's perfectly rejecting the R level 3040 and the D pivot/round number 3000. Very interesting.

Rob appears to have programmed the 2b reversal (just google it), between v7 and v6 we seem to be nailing these turns.   
  
Rob I really still like a lot of the v6 signals.

Welcome grovnus, you might be able to see a 123 on your chart if you set ShowDots=true.

V7 beta is focused on **aggressive** entries.  
This means that **by design** it does not wait for a valid 123.  
If **you cannot find any 123** then you may decide not to trade that signal.  

This is what I was writing about in my reply to Halba see [post #277](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5227889#post5227889).

i also like the signal that v6 generate but my problem is, its a bit late entry for me, also we need a filter for this on the higher timeframe coz there are times that it gives false entry signal. but the early warning alarm works fine it does its job well. if the alarm is triggered i immediatly pull the FE and watch for the candles to close above or below the base C, or point no.3. then i pull the trigger to enter the market.

If you are already using **123PatternsV7** then you may be interested in this..  
  
**123AlarmsV7**

  1. Immediately after 123PatternsV7 paints a signal, 123AlarmsV7 **plays a WAV file**.
  2. There are options to show **popups** or send **email** messages.
  3. This alarm system requires that **123PatternsV7** is installed. See [post #235](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5219503#post5219503).

[http://www.sierrachart.com/userimage...4126025615.png](http://www.sierrachart.com/userimages/upload_2/1324126025615.png)just one idea  
  
i build a custom ZZ custom 123  
  
see yellow line  
  
it use the folowing logic  
  
high=low=EQUILIB  
  
if candel + EQUILIB = (OPEN + HIGH)/2  
if candel -EQUILIB = (OPEN+LOW)/2  
  
normal zz is purple line  
  
settings are same for both zz  
  
do u think it improves ur system ???  
  
regards

Hi mate,  
  
Can you tell me what is printing the dots, and is it repainting, market is closed so I cannot check what it is doing.  
  
Is it similar to fractal in some ways?

Hi, been following this thread for a while now. Just sucking in all that info like a sponge.   
  
Robdee, I know you said this ain´t no support thread to the indi.  
I´m yet not allowed to send pm. So I apologize for this post.  
  
My question is why or how you determinate where to draw the fibo in the picture at post #291   
When I look at the pic it all seems great with bounce att fibo 50 and everything.  
But its a already printed chart. How about when its live. ( with other words, how to predict the future ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) )  
  
Why not choose point 2 earlier or later?  
  
Se attached pic.

I would say, it depends the depth of the ZZ ?  
It's always harder to see verify this after the chart was drawn as hi-lows always move.

Welcome Zeb_Sailor, yes that is the question! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
They are all valid 123's, so which one is the right one for drawing the fibo.  
  
As you say, while the structure unfolds (live in real time) it is not easy. We should keep an open mind and keep updating our fibo when new price points appear. It becomes a bit of an 'art form' which neither I nor my maths based indicators have mastered yet.  
  
First the **ideal setup**  
1-2-3-break (all four steps visible)  
NOW draw fibo from 1-2 and look for retrace to 50%  
If a good reaction to 50% (no candles close below it)  
then I have high confidence in reaching 210% and 380% targets  
Observe reaction to first target  
If price action breaks through easily (complete candles on the other side)  
then it makes sense to hold on for second target  
  
Second the **non-ideal setup**  
1-2 (only two steps visible)  
now draw fibo from 1-2 and look for retrace to 50%  
(same sequence as above)  
  
Use a ZigZag or fractals indicator (or 123PatternsV6) if you need help spotting the price points.  
  
Hope that helps.  
  
_Robdee_

Thanks for the answer Robdee,  
  
In other words I need to take more "artclasses" to get the right feeling/touch ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
( or a crystal ball ) ;p  
  
Untill then I´ll stick to the 'ideal setup' and simultaneously try to improve my skills in "painting" ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Thank you for sharing your knowledge with us!  
I´ll keep watching this thread.

EURUSD  
Asia had a bullish run then London opened _near_ 50% fibo.  
7:50 Buy signal (near price point 3) failed to reach first target.  
Resistance found inside previous day sell zone.  
14:00 Sell signal (near price point 3) eventually broke through first bearish target.

Your broker is sending you a little bit different price and volume data compared to my broker. I use IBFX demo for my charts. This is the best MT4 data feed in my opinion. See my previous post on this topic [post #2078](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=2488135#post2488135).

Thought I would share this chart.Drew blue and red trend lines basically through the centre of the green and mag dots from 123v7 version 1 indy  
Then looked for 123 breakout of the trend.Picked up both changes of the trend

EURUSD  
Bulls continued a push into overbought territory.  
Reactions to targets suggest profit taking + bearish interest.  
I'm not drawing conclusions from what I see as essentially low volume end of year holiday trading.  
In other words 'a mess'.

Hello davidtrader  
  
V7 beta1 uses zigzag.  
V7 beta2 uses _no_ zigzag.  
I wrote my own fractal code instead of zigzag.  
If you want to see the price points set ShowDots=true.

if we filter the fractal with type of candel does it add value ????  
  
candel - & blue dot  
  
candel + & red dot

I'm still enjoying the multiple entries that v6 gives. With 2 shooting stars on daily at what appears to be a sell zone I would have been focused on sells at break of 2 point or earlier if possible.  
  
Rob is it time to set up ea's that can be demo'd?

hello and welcome to the thread.  
  
as i understand it this is how to use the version 7 of the indicator, and the alarm.  
  
put the following on a chart:  
123v7  
123v7alarm  
zigzag set to depth 1  
  
now, whenever you get the alarm (the popup and/or the blue/red candle) you take a position if it is in conjunction with the current and ongoing trend, as per taking into consideration how to see the swingpoints and direction of 123s.  
  
  
i hope this helps somewhat.

I am a little bit confused here.   
From robdee's live performance in myfxbook, it looks like this is not a successful trading system.   
  
Why still got so high rate? Is there anything I missed?

Ultimately 123 is an attempt to use the Elliot Wave structure and could really be numbered zero, one, two, to make it compatible.  
  
We should start at fractal zero.  
We have a wave to a fractal at one.   
A wave back to another (opposite style) fractal at two.   
Then we try to catch the third wave ... if price moves past one again.  
  
We only know for sure that a third wave is in progress, when price breaks past the fractal at one.  
  
However, we can gain extra pips if we make an act of faith and enter between one and two and are then correct about a pending break, past one, taking us into Elliott wave three.  
  
(Different strategies for entering between one and two could probably take up their own thread; Fibonacci ratios, reversal candle patterns and spread cost calculations being being amongst them.)  
  
Maybe this is a chance to rename the traditional 123 to zero one two. It would certainly clarify what this is versus what the conventional 123 was and also integrate it seamlessly into the Elliott Wave.  
  
Elliott Wave is a tough subject, but parts of it are easy enough to use. Renaming 123 to 012 would somewhat harmonize the two where they overlap and take advantage of the knowledge available in both camps.

Hi Rob  
A comparison between v6 and 7. 7 does a great job today after the eur rejected Y's high.  
  
I have added 8 lwma just to show my old fall back of an open/close above/below in trend is a good trade often enough in itself. the entries around 2983 and 2945 shown perfectly.

_Happy New Year![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
_Only during previous two days can I see proper trading volume and sensible patterns.  
That is 4th and 5th January. Before that is just a mess.   
  
EURUSD

  1. pullback from point 2 at 1.2909
  2. London Open above 50% fibo at 1.2932
  3. V7 sell signal follows point 3
  4. 65 pips to first target
  5. 140 pips to second target

Click this chart to see the full size image.  
  
Conclusion: Today was another good example of waiting for 1 2 3 to form against a 50 fibo.  
When London forms point 3 near 50 fibo this is a sensible pattern.

I must say I am glad that NFP week is over.  
This usually means we can settle down for the next three weeks with some sensible trading patterns.  
  
EURUSD  
London bulls "paddled against the current" stalling near 1.28  
A small bearish 123 formed at that level  
The 50 fibo (1.28) rejected one hour before NFP news  
Overall drop for day was 1.28 to 1.27

Ok, a slightly different approach. Not using the larger fibo targets and filtering the trades using the v7-dots. No other indicators attached, plain v7. Besides that, I think one should make sure which sessions to trade.  
  
I was looking at the thread again last week after being of for a while. Mid december I posted some charts with the first v7 release. During the holidays I have looked at it again, but as movement and liquidity is poor and unreliable, any outcome during this period should be neglected. So, last week I started things up again with the current v7 version and today I decided to give it a shut.  
  
I like to draw lines, simple lines from dot to dot, fractal to fractal (not using fractals myself) or using Demark lines (in most trading I use this). This will filter a lot of signals out. As Robdee said in this thread that (about the v6 arrows) not all arrows should be seen as direct trade signals, but that they should be filtered.  
  
As we can choose to display the dots in v7, I use this for drawing lines. For an up-line (breaking down): connect the last/current blue dot with the prior blue dot that was below the current blue dot (just as TD-lines, Demark). The other way around for down-lines.  
  
Now I need my aggressive 123pattern signal to close below/above the trendline break. This means AFTER the break, within a few candles. When a signal comes first, then followed by a trendline break and I still can get in, I won't. First the break, then the signal (the signal candle can break the line as well). Stop is at the last dot high/low (=+spread). Target is at R:R:1. This is not an ideal situation in most systems, but.... As it's the aggressive version, the goal is to grab this instant movement, collect some pips and get out. In my other trading I use a more conservative RR, I am not a gambler! In another thread I have learned that jurn_e makes a nice return by doing just so, collecting short run's. For this aggressive version I think such an approach could work.   
  
I made my first live trade this morning. In the chart it’s the second trade that I marked. The first one I missed. The first trade gave me a nice 11pip, now see what happens in the coming week. Will keep you posted.

very interesting pbb, i have done a lot of back testing and thinking during the holidays and come to the conclusion that the signals given by the 123v7 work very nicely if used in conjunction with divergence. i keep a macd and slow stochastic on my charts because of this.

Robdee  
  
I am very familiar with the 123 pattern  
  
I installed your indicator (version 7) on todays EURUSD (5 minute chart)  
  
Around 8:40am EST (NY time) the indi drew a bullish bar and the two lines  
  
See image  
  
I do not see the 123 pattern  
  
I like it that your indicator gave the signal, but I want to understand its "thinking"

pgpb,  
  
On his posts 202 & 235, he explains that v.7 is for aggressive entries - unlike the 123 of v.6. I hope this helps a bit.

Anyone can make simple ea based on 123patternsv7?sell when red dot appear and buy when blue dot appear.  
  
I tried it manually with 15m looks really accurate to me 

Slow and Steady!

Hi everyone, I have been focusing on my univeristy studies and work, so trading is a low priority. Quite refreshing actually to take a break from it after years of studying the markets.  
  
Looking at yesterday's London session I see that **my very favourite setup** was there very plain to see. _Now I just need to catch those ideal setups as they happen!_  
  
**EURUSD**  
London Open forms point 3 on 50% fibo (ideal)  
Wait for V7 buy zone to form  
+80 pips to first fibo target

Hello all!  
  
I've installed both 123PaternsV6 and 123PaternsV7 on the same M5 chart and I like signals they produce.  
  
But I've found that 123PaternsV7 does not update along with prices flow.  
I mean that when initialized it shows signals and that's it.  
While 123PaternsV6 does process new bars as they arrive, 123PaternsV7 does not.  
  
How can this be fixed?  
Thanks!  
  
PS. I set VolFilter = False. Maybe this has caused the problem.  
I found that with VolFilter = False the indicator shows better signals (for me).  
Also I do not trust Volume values in the forex market.  
Since they are just ticks density, not real contracts volume.  
Thus if some banks fill multimillion contracts there will be few ticks ("volumes") but a huge price shift.

Hi Robdee!  
  
I have been studying forex trading for some months and doing practice trades on a few systems available in FF. I find 123 Patterns system is interesting and viable. Your team efforts in getting the system improved and fine-tuned and in helping others is really praisworthy. At the moment I'm going thro' the key thread posts. Many thanks ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Hi Robdee!  
  
Please consider to upgrade the indicator in the following way:  
  
...  
  
extern bool ShowComment = True;  
  
...  
  
//+------------------------------------------------------------------+  
//| Custom indicator iteration function |  
//+------------------------------------------------------------------+  
int start()  
{  
// REDRAW ONLY ONE TIME PER CANDLE  
if (redrawtime == Time[0]) // if already redrawn on this candle then do no more  
{  
if (ShowComment) // IF USER WANTS COMMENT  
StatusMessage();   
return(0);  
} // if already redrawn on this candle then do no more  
  
else redrawtime = Time[0]; // remember when the indicator was redrawn  
  
...  
  
// update the status display  
if (ShowComment)  
StatusMessage();   
}// end of start()  
  
...

Guys trying to trade 123 s is dead, ok you may get the odd good run but today's market is all about stop hunting, evolve and survive.  
I use to trade cubbys old 123 whilst reasonably good at the time try to trade it now and you'll see, not a critisism just observation.

depends on your timeframe and how tight your stops are....if you are on 1hr or higher and willing to risk at least 50 pips - aint nothing wrong with it and risk to reward ratio is intact.  
  
now if you are trying to trade it on 5 min - you are experiencing some serious churn right about now.

Good day Robdee   
  
I've been following your thread for sometime now and I find your concept of 1-2-3 pattern trading very interesting.  
  
What actually catch my attention the most is your circle bars. I have always been fascinated by cycles in the financial market.  
  
Do you mind sharing the **cycle bar** that shows **date at key turning point** with me. I will like to study it and probably add my idea to it and make it better.

Hi, RobDee;  
  
First of all, Happy new year, and merry Christmas to you (If you are celebrating); also happy holiday.  
  
you done a great job on the 123 pattern indicator. I am running simulation, which is very profitable.   
  
Well, little bit more to ask, as I am not good at counting 123; if you can add in the 123 numbers, and arrow (As V6), it will be much more helpful for people like me.  
  
Thanks.

It is very nice to combine 123Paterns with Zigzag indicator; but while working with the standard ZigZag, proposed by MetaQuotes, I have found some errors. The main problem is that it doesn't proceed the case of the outside bar properly. At first, i just want to initiate a new post to talk about the errors and optimization of Zigzag indicator. but I am only a junior number which is not authorized to do that by FF. I don't know if someone else found the Zigzag had some paradox inherent in its plotting as me. By the way, could anyone tell me how to be a certified member of FF? thanks.

+50 +13 +20 +18 +BE +35 +16 +25 = 177 pips on EU today. First signal I missed. 2nd signal I reversed because it was to close to the fibo and MA. The 3rd signal I reversed because it did not agree with my filters. The BE I closed because it was against my filters and in hindsight I should not have taken it.  
  
Nice Indi RobDee, I use the 123 reversal everyday in my trading, have done for years. But there is no doubt that this works very well provided a good filter is used, I use the TDI and stochastics from the TMS method along with Fibos and the 50 and 200EMA.  
  
The second chart I have marked up with the 123s as I saw them. matches up pretty well.  
  
Thanks Robdee. Shame the thread died.

Here is one in progress. SL is at B/E so it can do what it wants. But this Indi does work if you know how to filter it.

Would you look at that! Just kissed the TP but didn´t fill it. I´ll leave it see if it squeezes down another couple of pips. Although the Oscillators are showing a potential turn back up.

That´s number 3 in the bank. +20 +25 +20 = +65 pips today so far.

Last one for today +20pips. Didn´t take the signal straight away because of the news. Used the 100% expansion for the TP.  
  
txfx. It is not rocket science, put the Oscillators on a chart then mark the signals with a vertical line. Do the oscillators agree with the signal. Is there divergence. Does everything agree, if not then pass and wait for the next one. Look at the first signal, LH edge of the shaded area, BRN very near, Oscillators in OS and possible Bullish Divergence, is this a good short signal? Just repeat this exercise for each signal. It significantly reduces the number of losers.

Hello dee50, I am very impress with your exits. Your are squeezing out almost all if not all pips out of each trade. You are exiting at the end of  
each move. Could you tell me how you figure out those exits?  
To wish you lots of pips, would be redundant because you are getting them all.  
Love your charts, keep them coming please.

Let the chart tell you where price is going, Looking Left, will give you clues. But if in doubt, 123 patterns follow Market Harmonics CD = AB.  
I also use the premise that if price pulls back (Leg 2 - 3) to 38% Fib then it is likely the expansion will reach the 161.8% Expansion unless there is something bigger in the way like a major S&R Level, like wise the pullback to the 50% Fib is likely to expand to the 127% Expansion.  
I have attached 2 charts for todays trades, they should make it more obvious.

dee50, thank you for taking the time to explain your exits. I will glue those charts next to my computer, they are worth their price in gold.  
One more thing, Is HTF S&R = Higher Time Frame S&R, and BRN = Big Round Number?

They are part of the Trading Made Simple method and show when the Green Line crosses the Red line on the TDI indicator. They are a little sensitive and sometimes show when the lines just touch rather than cross, so you always have to check visually. On the larger TFs they would actually signify a Trade entry point.

EU +62 +90 = 152 pips today.  
  
I prefer V6. V7 works well but some how V6 seems to be a little better.  
  
Is no one else trading this method??

I am going to do you a big favor and Not give you my Method and template. Why?  
  
My "Method" uses primarily Analysis of PA, S&R levels, Oscillators and the 123patternV6 indi, in that order, my method is not a Mechanical Entry Method, far from it.  
  
If you are not yet familiar with the 123 concept. There is no support on this thread, no one to explain it, with out that you would be wasting your time.  
  
I would recommend that you stay with the Genesis Method as there is plenty of experience there to help you.  
  
I know the sight of many pip wins is alluring but it has taken me 7 years to get to this point. No one method on it´s own will achieve that for you.  
  
Hope you take this for how it is meant.

Very good answer dee! it is so true and so much to learn to make it work for you. I think I got an idea of what your doing from some of your pics but I've been working on this stuff for many many years also, lol.

Lots of sense in your response. There is not lot of traffic in this thread, and because I am weird, I like it. Since I saw your first post here, I saw the value in  
your charts. My big request to you is, please keep posting your charts, there is so much to learn from them. Thank you. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

These should help.  
  
1\. 123 Chart Pattern + Fib expansion. Sunil Mangwani. Concentrates on the 123 Reversal Pattern. My Favorite for the most pips.  
  
2\. 123system. Mark Crisp. His emphasis is on the HTFs and stocks but the concept translates to the LTFs and Forex very easily.  
  
3\. TTE Traders Trick Entry. Joe Ross. Earlier entry on the 123, but use with caution. Great in a trending market but can rip your pants off and throw you to the ground in a Ranging market.

This is what is on my chart. There is also a standard Moving Average EMA 200 and stochastics 8,3,3. Should all load with the template.  
  
I am currently testing with the EMA on 20 and the TDI red line removed showing just the Green and Yellow and the volatility Bands.  
  
For those not familiar, the Synergy APB candles are Hieken Ashi candles. I compiled a couple of PDFs for another thread about these, if I can find them I will post them here to explain their use.

5 minute, 15 minute, 1 hour. Too many false signals on the 1 minute and until I can work out a better filter I am leaving it alone.

EU +45pips news related but taken on the 123. Support confirmed by Trend Line see chart 2. TP was 100% Expansion because it was a news related trade. Notice how the TDI and Stochs were OB confirming Profit Target. A second trade may shape up later.

..i trade from London Open but was too late to the charts this morning to trade this EU short (5m). Counter this week's trend but a setup's a setup! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
...and here's a warning signal for the exit, nearly a 123 reversal so stops would have been moved just above '2'. Need to be more vigilant on counter trend setups.

For those of you with regular day jobs, who have difficulty trading the lower TFs have a look at the HTFs. Here are Daily and 4 Hr charts. The 123 concept works on any TF and the rules and target expectations remain the same. How many pips can you see on these charts. Most of them would be gained whilst you were at work or even asleep. Just remember you need to use a good Money Management technique and/or a good Money Manager EA.

Confirmation of the Reversal off the Low of the Day. Rejection from the 38.2% Fibo and a failure of a second attempt at the low of the day and Hidden Divergence Confirm what sidefx was saying, the 123 gave an early indication of the change the rest confirmed it.

Those are the indicators that I am using. These are my preferences. If you want to look for updates or use different versions that is entirely up to you.

EJ +165 pips. On other threads traders are pulling in good pips from the eur/jpy, so I thought I would give it a go earlier today. Don´t know if i was just lucky or what. Looks like I might have to take trading more seriously.

eur/jpy +76 pips. Now I see why so many traders are trading the eur/jpy, it just wants to give you those pips. this is how the eur/usd used to be, you had to be a real dipstick not to make money.

Thanks, but there is no special talent here. I use the expansion tool, targets are the 127% or the 161%. Leave the trade alone, walk away, until it hits your TP or Stop which ever is the first, that is actually the hardest part. I used to fiddle and adjust my TP all the time, the stress was killing me, now I leave it alone. I only interfere if PA or the indis tell me it is over. I manage the trade only until I have moved the stop to B/E after that I often leave the computer and go and potter about in my vegetable patch. 

Cut your Losers short and let your Winners run.

Hi to everyone and thank you Robdee for your 123 indi.  
I use Demark's sequential in multi time frames and it is usefull also to trade 123.  
Please see my image in which you can see EURUSD chart 30 m with setup 8 and 9 and chart 5m with 123 formation.....so setup on higher time frame give me alert and 123 on lower time frame give me timing to enter the market with very low risk!  
But there is a problem: on web there are a lot of Demark's indi but all are incompleted......so if you are interested I can share with you my experience and you can code a real and full Demark's sequential code.  
Thank's in advance

EU +75 pips. I closed the trade at the 127% Expansion my initial target was the 161% but Price movement down has been so slow today, that I nearly lost the will to keep on living. Entry was early in the day following Pin bars in 3 TFs with a small 123 pullback giving the entry. If I had waited and taken the signaled 123 I would still have made 50 pips. Nothing valid on the EJ today.

EU +40 pips + EJ +40 pips = 80 pips for today. Every one a 123. Notice how I am using the target from a larger 123 for my TPs. Do not be afraid to try this, the worst that can happen is that price will not reach your extended target and you will have to B/E.

dee50, In the last two attachments your three points to set the fibo expasion are the immediately previous 123 points determined by the 123 indicator. However, I have seen in few other attachments you use different points. Can you expand a little on what is your criteria for choosing the anchor points. More specifically, how do you choose them when they are not 123 points?  
Thank you and have a wonderful weekend. :O)

They are 123 points, you will probably have noticed by now that the 123 Indi does not identify all the 123s, and I do not choose my trades based on the indi, I choose my trades based on what 3 time frames are showing me. The fact that my trades coincide with the 123 Ind just goes to show how good it is. As for how I determine my TP, I do not use the Fib Expansion In isolation. I hope the attached chart explains it. I look for Confluence of Fibs & S&R where price has been before, is price reacting to the fib levels. That is how I determine my initial TP, if another 123 forms after my entry I measure the Expansion and see if it agrees with my initial assessment. If I have missed the entry for a larger 123 I measure the expansion from the previous formation. I base this on the fact that the larger the 123 formation is, the more relevant it is because it will also be visible on the Higher Time frames so more traders will be reacting to it.

AU +60 pips. Took this trade on my Futures account. A mixed trade using a BPC and 123 combination for the entry. BPC = Breakout Pullback Continuation. I do not need to explain this, do I?

EU +50 pips. So simple even I can make money. 123 off support followed by 123 break of resistance confirming momentum long. Does not get much easier.  
  
I really do not understand why more traders are not trading this pattern, one of the oldest, most reliable patterns that there is. And yet, the threads here on FF and other forums about the 123, are short lived. Traffic light methods run for years with only mediocre success. Ain´t folks queer?

Cheers! Another great day for you. Your win rate is very high. When was the last time you took a loss? I'd be interested in seeing the losers too ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Do you ever use the Demark Combination stuff like this?

Last loser was here. [http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...62#post6706262](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=6706262#post6706262).  
  
I used to have lots of losses, years ago, I believed the crap that losses are part of trading and you should accept them, but I wasn´t making any money with that attitude, now, I do not like losses!! I close for B/E or a small loss, if I have to, and then re enter if price turns and continues. I see no need to hold a trade until my stop loss is hit, I actually think that that is one of the most stupid things to do in trading. If my entry is wrong, I get out.  
If you pick your entry correctly there should be no need to take a loss.  
I never ever let a winner turn into a loser.  
I like the 123 entry off Support or Resistance because price will move far enough to guarantee a profit or at least a safe exit.  
I limit myself to no more than 2-3 trades per day, reduces my exposure to risk and reduces the chance of an impulse trade. Unless I am feeling playful. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
I have learned to be patient and wait for right setup.  
I pass on trades that I am not 100% confident about.

Short answer. No. I have looked, recently, at Demark but considered that the method did not offer anything significantly better for me so I stuck with PA, experience and a bit of the TMS.

Thanks dee50. Hope you don't mind my asking, do you day-trade alongside another job or trade for a living, or just trade for 'fun'? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
When do you typically move your SL to B/E to 1/. minimise losses on a 'bad' entry and 2/. reduce risk on a 'good' trade?

Trade for a Living.  
  
For your second question I am going to be cheeky and use one of your responses from another thread "on a ranging day like this i need to reduce/remove risk as soon as price action says it is reasonable to do so" I surmise from your response that you already know how to do this, so I would only be teaching you to suck eggs. Which is a very strange statement because you do not suck eggs you blow them!![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

For the first 2 years I was shit. Then the next 2 years I improved. The last 3 years I have really made money and each year I have gotten better.  
  
Some people come into trading and are making money after a few months (I really hate them), the rest of us have to put in 1,000s of hours of screen time, go bald and develop a paunch and eventually retire before we become profitable. 12 months is not long enough.

...yes, don't get me wrong before I went full-time, i'd amassed the 1000's of hrs of screentime. My problem when I decided to move to trading FT was being under-capitalised and not really trading with money I could afford to lose. I'd convinced myself that the capital would be enough (look at the back-testing, demoing and small money forward testing, how can this fail?) and that remortgaging the house to fund it was a sensible thing to do!

No matter how politely you make your requests, it is patently obvious you have not read the thread or used the tools available to you.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f621.png?v=15.1)  
Robdee´s last post was on the 17 September 2012, so he is unlikely to respond to you.  
I posted a couple of PDFs about 123s, just 3 pages back, so you have not even bothered to look back.  
I posted a link to another thread with information about 123s, just 2 pages back.  
  
There is the google search which would provide lots of information  
There is the search facility here on FF  
  
And last but certainly not least, this is where you should have started your trading journey from is Babypips.com

To be honest, I can not say that there was one defining moment, I can think of many Aha moments none of which was the definitive turning point but they all contributed to my development as a trader. As you know Trading is an amalgamation of knowledge, a jigsaw puzzle if you will, if a piece is missing the picture is incomplete.  
  
But if I chose one thing that has had the greatest impact is when I had the confidence to go for bigger TPs. And I stopped micro managing each trade which usually resulted in my closing out the trades far too early. One of the benefits of that is much less stress and of course, much greater profitability.

I thought so. Looking through your other posts on other threads I got the impression that you had been trading for some time and I am glad to see that there are others who have survived the blood bath that is Trading. And you are absolutely right, being under capitalised is the kiss of death for would be traders and the other is the problem that they go from demo to real money trading and do not realize the mental impact that has. That alone can kill a trading career.

EU + 50 pips. Initial TP was at the 161.8% expansion but momentum was strong so moved it to BRN. Entry was 123 + BPC. No brainer.

Hey Dee  
  
You are not talking to yourself, I am sure I am not the only one listening (and very much appreciating your posts).  
I took the same trade and got out with just under 50 pips

Hi dee50,  
  
Please don't stop posting your trades. I find them very inspiring. I am a follower of the TMS thread but I find your 5 minute trades posted on this thread to be more suited to my trading style. I will post some trades when I start trading the method properly. I am still absorbing the material from the pdf's you posted on this site about fibs and 123's etc. 

The consistency you seek is in your mind, not the markets. Mark Douglas

I have been trying out some alternate settings, this is for 123pattern V6 on the 5 min. You get less signals but they appear to be more accurate. I have only tried this on eurusd. On pairs that are more volatile like the GU I would advise caution as you will still get many fake signals, that is the nature of 123s.  
  
It goes with out saying, but I am going to say it anyway, BACKTEST first.

Does this answer your question. Large Blue arrows are the signals from 123pattern v6, all short. For the uninitiated, it looks like Demark is indicating Longs, where as the only valid signal is a long based on the 13 candle count at the bottom RH of the chart.

EU +40 pips. Only valid signal today. But if it pays out 1 is enough. I initially targeted the 3050 but realized that there was a significant S&R at 3060 from the beginning of June. Slap on the wrist for me for not having identified that prior to taking the signal.  
  
Edit. Sorry I am not with it today, just checked the other pairs that I "normally" monitor and there were signals on the EJ, UJ, GU and AU in fact the EJ would have yielded around 80 pips. Just goes to show, you should not get up early as I did today. The signals were on the 15 min charts.

Hi,  
thank you to all great work...but I must say taht I am not comfortable with 123 by swing....I prefer 123 by bars as in Ross'books.  
I explain better: I use only bars to see 123 ...for example 2 bars up and 1 down forming 123....or 3 bars up and 1 down ....or 4 bars up and 1 down .....or 5 bars up and 1 down...stop.....I don's use 123 formed by more than 5 bars.  
Please see images:

EU + 50 pips. My favorite 123. A signal from a S&R level in this instance the 200 EMA, then lots of confirmation all the way down.  
  
The smaller text you can see is another Indi that shows 123s and Ross Hooks, I am in the process of trying it out in conjunction with the 123pattern Indi.  
  
searching thru other threads on the 123 pattern, I am astounded by the number of "Traders"?? who say the 123 swing pattern does not work or they can not make money with this pattern. I would suggest that they first learn what the pattern is all about and what the psychology is behind it.

Yes,you are right....123 (by swing or by bars) is the firt step for inversion....you can read it as wave 1 -2 and 3 (breackout of top of wave 1) or ABC (breackout of top of wave A).

If you started your own thread about bar counts or Demark you might attract the attention of the coders here on FF and you may also get more interest from other traders depending on what you called the thread, rather than posting in a thread called "123Pattern V6 Revisited".

I think most traders can´t make 123 work because they do not know how to read PA and because they treat the pattern like a mechanical entry system, which it is not. Do you know lots of traders who win when the market chops?

Reading thru an older 123 thread I came across this PDF. Slightly different approach to entries, thought you all might find it interesting.

Sorry I did not answer your question. Yes most of the trades are off S&R, that is the true nature of 123s and because they are off S&Rs you can usually bank pips.

GU (15Min) support becoming resistance (SbR) switch earlier, amazing how price 'switches' to the pip sometimes like this one! I was late to the entry off an engulf.

Thanks dee50, very interesting. Could be a similar setup on EU (15M) forming now in fact...There's also 61.8/R1 confluence around potential point '3'.  
  
Edit: setup now void. '1' exceeded.

I agree it looked like it could have set up for a 123, especially off a Double Top with Regular Divergence, but there was below---  
  
Trend Line support  
Hidden Divergence  
  
and now Bearish Divergence. I would prefer to see the Stochs Divergence coming from OB/OS to below/above the 68 or the 32. This would make the divergence much more convincing.  
  
Just above current price is a previous Minor S&R  
  
With this sort of PA I would not expect to be trading a 123, I would be looking to trade a Range or Channel. However as it is still only a 35 pip Range i would not consider an entry for a 10 - 15 pip gain as worth the risk.

EU +50 pips. Main reason for taking this trade was the Pin Bar at the BRN and the BPC at previous S&R, but it was confirmed by a 123 later. Target was the Trend Line. Do not care if price drops further, +50 for a Friday afternoon is good enough.

Hi [dee50](http://www.forexfactory.com/dee50),  
first I wan to thank you for all of your explanation, I'm new to forex and I might be slow in understanding your way and I would appreciate if I can get it.  
I really like your work and read your posts more than one time but for some reason it's still not so clear for me yet how do you choose your entry points , once you said that they are not based on 123 system only , and the indicator itself doesn't show always when to enter , I'm confused for a little bit , is this based on your experience or other tools that you use ?  
thanks

Yesterday EU +5 +37. I have marked everything on the chart. 2nd trade was a Pin Bar Reversal entry followed by a 123 confirmation.  
Today so far. EU +30. Everything is obvious, you just need to look.

The short answer is, my entries are based on my experience, 1,000s of hours of screen time. Every thing I use is on the chart and if you look carefully you will see that every one of my entries has a reason for it, in fact I will normally only enter when there are at least 2 - 3 factors confirming the entry. These are always on the chart, they are not hidden away in the dark recesses of my mind.

Who spotted that the reason for todays entry was a Triple Bounce off an S&R followed by the 123 + a BPC. The TB is only visible if you zoom out, this is one of the problems of trading the lower time frames, you do not see the bigger picture. We focus too much on a small portion of time.  
  
Here endeth the lesson.

that unfortunately is a reality of trading! unless you go to one of the traffic light system threads where there is some one to guide you and the indicators tell you when to enter and exit.

EU +35. Pin Bar off S&R and really strong Divergence followed by 123 + BPC to confirm. Confluence of the 161 expansion, 38% Fib and 200 EMA and short term Resistance made this the TP.  
  
The BPC was perfect, price broke back above the BRN then a short pullback, almost to the pip, to the BRN. I forgot to mark it on the chart but you can clearly see it.

EU +30 & +32 = 62 pips. No brainers today. Short Breakout, 123 + BPC, TP at Daily S&R. Then Long Divergence at Major Support with 123, Target the 200 EMA. Soros I aint, but it puts food on the table with minimum risk.  
  
I have been trying out another 123 Indi, you see it on my charts the little numbers 123, it is also pretty good, it is more adjustable. it was developed to show Ross Hooks, I have that feature disabled because in these markets you get so many Ross Hooks it makes the feature pointless especially on the Lower Time Frames. You will also have to adjust the "rejectifheightlessthan" parameter from 15 to 150 for a 5 digit broker other wise you will get "a LOT" of false signals.

I have been trying out another 123 Indi, you see it on my charts the little numbers 123, it is also pretty good, it is more adjustable. it was developed to show Ross Hooks, I have that feature disabled because in these markets you get so many Ross Hooks it makes the feature pointless especially on the Lower Time Frames.

EU +75. 4th July 20 min trade. I almost decided to call it a day when the 123 signal came at a BO level, then someone cut the rope and off it went, did not have the time to think about the TP so targeted the S&R level but price moved so fast that I dropped the TP to the BRN. SL was a joke I moved it straight to BE and then went for a ciggie when I came back there it was.

Congratulations.  
I also trade the same, but only 30 pips. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Congrats [dee50](http://www.forexfactory.com/dee50) , actually it was the [Draghi](http://www.forexfactory.com/news.php?do=news&id=435927) at ECB Press Conference today who did cut the robe for such a fall, I've been told many times that when a you trade technical strategies it's recommended to stay a way from the markets at such news times like this, I work on a Demo for now and I had a position from early morning but I closed it before the conference to do it as they recommended, but it seems that it makes no difference when you are trading a good strategy or at least you have the needed experience ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1) .

BO = Break Out.  
  
Yes I knew Draghi was giving a press conference, that was what I had been hanging around for. I always trade the news, have done for many years and Draghi is always good for at least 50 pips I think he does it on purpose. If I am in a trade before the news I asses the likely impact and then decide whether to stay in the trade or close but the main thing is I move my stop to lock in profits then if it goes against me I do not lose anything.

EU +50. It is too easy. There would have had to have been a negative print for the EU not to have gone down. Not a bonafide 123, but it shows that you can make money from the news. Waiting now for another possible entry.

Here's once.   
  
Price already pulled back and then went passed the "2" candle for a conservative entry. Then it pulls back again.

This is an excellent site if you want to learn the intricacies of understanding and using PA.

Here is another pullback.   
  
Once it retraces and surpassed the "2" point, I will enter the trade. I'm confident PA will prove useless again, but lets just prove the people here wrong.

Why are you linking me to a website?   
  
I just showed you a valid 123 pattern, with a conservative entry that failed.   
  
Either my entry was wrong, which I'm confident it wasn't, or so called 'price action' is a load of B.S.

Continuing the theme. USDCAD Higher Time Frame 4H Channel. Does not hurt to look up, PA is in the center of the channel with Resistance at the same level. A great opportunity to go long??

I read the whole thread from zigzag simple -> advance -> complex -> expert -> nonesense.   
This thread is really dead from zigzag to a different dimension of chart..  
I use zigzag as my guide and it works very well.  
  
For the new traders just always make it simple. Make it too complicated doesn't make it profitable.

Sarcasm. WHY??? Your method of trading is clean and simple, I checked, but does that mean that every one elses methods are invalid?

I will respond on the thread that you started, be more appropriate.  
  
EDIT  
  
I have just read thru your thread and apart from the usual few gonads, most of the advice is extremely sound and there is nothing that I can add to it.

EU +70. Grueling day, was tempted to close so many times, but, I have learnt not to interfere with the trade. Multiple choice TPs so just kept moving the TP down as price continued to drift down, I finally opted for the area just above the confluence of 100% Fib, BRN and S&R.

EU +37. Some times you have to interfere and close a trade when the PA is telling you to. This is what I saw. Also if you look at the swing high, you have a large green candle followed by a large red candle which closes near the bottom of the green candle, this the signal for a Pin Bar on a higher time frame, in this instance the 15 min.

Always check HTF. You will miss important information if you only look at the lower time frame. Look Left, Look Up (for passing pigeons) and then act.

that's amazing!.  
I noticed that the candles are a little bit different from min" FXDD " , I'm not sure what time zone you live in but it looks like very near to what I have +3 GMT.  
also the doted Fib doesn't exist on my chart with the fact that I use the same template that you provided in earlier , is there something that I'm missing here ?  
thanks

Our charts are the same (attached). It is just that I used a chart with all the indis and heiken Ashi taken off for illustration purposes only.  
  
Your Fibs are different because, see attached. The fibs do not adjust themselves, you have to change them when required in this instance because the 0.0% Fib had been negated. How to use fibs is a whole other thread entirely, I have some PDFs about this I shall try to find them and post them.

Thanks for the sympathy, it is appreciated, but---  
  
I rarely trade after 17.00 my time, Bernanke was 20.00 my time. I am strictly 9-5 (GMT +1) my time of doing 18 hour days is long past. I just feel sorry for all those who listened to the Hype and were short the Euro. Just imagine all those Swing traders trading their Daily and 4 Hr charts who got stopped out.

Quick EU +25. Straight forward 123 on the 15 min, also available on the 5min. Price may well continue down to the 200 EMA, but I have to go out for a few hours.  
  
CU later

Well that's good to know that you didn't get any loss on that day ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) , your timing zone(+1GMT) matches London time and I think this is the best time to trade ,I think you paid a lot till you reached that plan to trade only during 9-5 and it looks pretty much a wise thing to do, I find many people trust others more than they trust their selves and that's exactly where their problems begin.

EU +40pips. Straight forward 123 off S&R on the 15 min. TP was BRN 161.8% and short term S&R. This trade could was signaled on the 5 - 15 - 6o min charts, take your pick. Nice start to the week.

Good way to go [dee50](http://www.forexfactory.com/dee50) ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1) , and thanks for the links,there are a lot of valuable information in it and I enjoyed reading so far.  
I understood that TMS method is basically for 4H charts when the green line crosses the red line we should enter on the 1st or 2nd candle according to Big E , however I can see that [Phx62](http://www.forexfactory.com/phx62) worked on 1H time frame and rarely on 15M , but in all cases he rely on price action and uses his common sens for the trade , do you do the same ?  
just more question : do trade any other pair with TMS and price action other than EUR/US ?  
Thanks

I am REALLY struggling to understand how it is that 123break patterns do NOT work for me. They simply always reverse and hit my SL. And I always go with the trend too....

4 hr charts Big E. If people had read the TMS thread they would have realized that BIG E traded the 4 hr at night and the 1hr during the day. Phx62 trades primarily the 1 hr, but also trades the 15 min. I trade the 1hr, 15min and 5min. Big E said the TDI is King on the 4hr but PA is King on all other time frames. However, the market has changed considerably since he said that, at the time the EU had a range of 200 pips per day, what does it have now? So as far as I am concerned PA is King on all time frames with TDI confirming a move. I have always used the 123 in my trading and I have always looked to the lower time frames 15min and 5 min for tighter entries.  
  
I personally prefer to trade the EU because I am very familiar with it I have been trading it almost exclusively for 7 years, I occasionally will look at the EJ, UJ, AU & GU.

That move was good for 30 pips using market harmonics, ran further but the market spiked back. That had nothing to do with a 123 failing, that was the market.

How on earth do you do this?   
  
Any chance you could teach me/mentor me?   
  
I've been studying charts for 15 hours a day for months, and I'm still struggling. I would really appreciate someone to focus on helping me improve.   
  
I've read ALL KINDS of price action literature, but when It comes to applying it, it never works out...  
  
I could really use some help.

what I understood that Big E traded 4H at night his time pacific time which equals London session and that's where most of the volume come, I couldn't agree more with you that price action is the king for all the time specially when you use it to trade one pair and become an expert with it like your kind self.  
my problem is that I see a lot of people talking about price action but I discover later that everyone means his own experience , not a material to study or specific points that can be worked with, for example you can build your entry on a candlestick shape over a support or a Resistance, but if you see a pattern like double top or triple top you may cancel it like what you traded today for EU, other people would say patterns are the best way to find your entry and still you find that market would drag then 100's of pips .  
I wish there is a way to define all the factors for price action and their preterites as it really keeps me confused .  
and thanks for being informative and helpful as usual.

To answer a multitude of questions, simply, I have copied this from Nial Fullers site, this is the link to the full piece. [http://www.learntotradethemarket.com...rading-signals](http://www.learntotradethemarket.com/forex-trading-strategies/how-to-filter-price-action-trading-signals). His emphasis is on the Daily, but he concentrates on just a few simple PA strategies that are easy to identify and to act upon and the beauty of this is, it transfers to the lower time frames. But, you just have to remember that any lower time frame signal is less reliable than one on the HTFs.  
  
This is the meat of it.  
  
"  
**The “big boys” know how to filter their trades**  
If you’ve fallen prey to thinking that the “big boys” are trading a hundred times a day and [day trading ](http://www.learntotradethemarket.com/forex-articles/why-i-hate-day-trading)until their eyes bleed, you’re mistaken. Many of the guys with big money wait on the sidelines patiently and “pounce” only when the best signals, levels and trends are present on their charts. You need to learn to think like the big boys, act “as if” you’re a “player”; be intelligent and stop using the market for entertainment and start treating this as a real business.  
The best and most logical explanation for why you should trade less is because **there are inherently less good signals for any strategy or system; think about it…the reason a signal is high-probability is because it doesn’t happen extremely often, if it did then it wouldn’t be a high-probability event would it?** If you force yourself to trade all the time you’re going to be taking a large quantity of useless and second-rate signals, this is simply a waste of your time and money.  
**Creating a filter checklist for you trades**  
A good exercise for any trader is to create their own checklist of different filters that they use to scan the markets for potential signals. You can just create a quick checklist with one to three sentences describing what the filter is and then an example image of the filter under it.  
Here’s an example filter checklist that I’ve created from the examples above (in yours you would place an example image below or next to each sentence like the ones above but maybe a little smaller):  
**1.****Look for a signal with a protruding tail that creates a false-break of a level.** Watch for obvious protrusions and false-breaks of key levels in the market. This filter can be applied to trending markets or to counter-trend trades. Wherever you have a key support or resistance level, keep an eye out for false-breaks / protrusions of that level.  
**2\. A long-tailed pin bar is a high-probability pin bar.** Long-tailed pin bars work very well in trending markets and as counter-trend signals, as we saw in the examples above. A long-tailed pin bar is always something to keep an eye out for when analyzing the markets.  
**3\. Don’t “bet” on a breakout…wait for confirmation instead**. A good filter to use for tempting looking breakout trades is to wait for the breakout and close above or below the level. Then, the breakout is “confirmed” and you can start looking for a signal in the direction of the break. This will help you avoid many false-breaks, especially in range-bound markets.  
**4\. Look for continuation signals after a pullback to support or resistance in the trend.** Trend continuation signals are a ‘bread and butter’ strategy that you need to watch for.Watch for trends and then retracements within those trends, then keep an eye out for signals forming from “value” areas that indicate the trend might resume.  
**5\. Don’t trade signals in tight “chop”.** Be cautious trading pin bars or other signals that form in thick and choppy consolidation. If you see two or three pin bars in a row as in our example above and the market is not coming off in the direction implied by the pins, it’s an indication that it’s probably not going to come off. We need to see momentum and a clear breakout from consolidation before entering from a signal formed in “chop”.  
**6\. Look for “confluence”.** Watch for obvious “hot points” in the market, or areas where two or three or more levels are intersecting…these are very high-probability levels to trade from.  
**7\. Avoid signals that form in “no man’s land”.** This one is sort of the opposite of the confluence point. If you see a signal that just looks like it formed without any type of confluence and looks like it’s just placed wrong, you should probably avoid it. This filter is especially important to use on the 4 hour and 1 hour charts.  
Whilst having things like checklists and an overall trading plan are very important, they are only one part of finding the best trading signals. The man or woman doing the analysis and pulling the trigger is JUST as important as the strategy or trading plan they are using.  
As traders, we need to develop our subconscious “gut” trading feel on an ongoing basis, learning from the charts and keeping notes and simply immersing ourselves in day-to-day market analysis and observation (note I didn’t say immerse ourselves in ‘trading’)**.** This helps us develop a good intuition and gut feel which go hand in hand with a good trading strategy."

EU +30. Not a 123 trade, but an example of what to do when PA is screaming at you. Look at all the clues at the top of the chart, set a realistic TP at the minor support and Hey Presto +30 pips and all just before Bernanke sends the market into a Tizzy.

Dee50,  
  
Thanks...I found this system cause I also trade using the 1-2-3 patterns.  
  
Thanks for the 1-2-3 pattern indicators. I could not get the V-6 indicator to work  
cause I think it's set-up for "RANGE BARS" and it kept freezing up my computer.  
Do you have any suggestions for this?  
  
Also, I'am a hugh fan of "Another Simple System 15 tf". Which trade the 1-2-3 pattern off of  
the 10 ema.  
  
Loveevery1 is using the: "Another Simple System"  
  
10 ema (magical ema)  
200 ema  
800 ema

This system and Another simple system in my opinion are the SECRET to forex. So thanks for keeping this  
alive and helping people! Out of the 3 or 4, 1-2-3 pattern indicators (V-6, I couldn't get to work) I'am  
using "show 123 v2" indicator. What do you think of that indicator? Or, do you like the other 2 that  
you posted better?  
  
Once again thanks for all your help, it is very much appreciated!

> Dee50, Thanks...I found this system cause I also trade using the 1-2-3 patterns. Thanks for the 1-2-3 pattern indicators. Also, I'am a hugh fan of "Another Simple System 15 tf". Which trade the 1-2-3 pattern off of the 10 ema. Loveevery1 is using the: "Another Simple System" 10 ema (magical ema) 200 ema 800 ema round numbers This system and Another simple system in my opinion are the SECRET to forex. So thanks for keeping this alive and helping people! Out of the 3 or 4, 1-2-3 pattern indicators (V-6, I couldn't get to work)Once again thanks...

Hi Snarlyjack, nice to see you are still around. I am very familiar with Arjuns 10ema method. Sorry I took so long to respond, I did not bother trading yesterday as I thought the market would dither along until Bernanke, but I thought it unlikely that Bernanke would say any thing different.  
  
Unable to start "123Patterns v6"  
Check to see if you have the standard MT4 "ZigZag" indicator installed, I am in the habit of cleaning out my indicator folder, and I deleted the zigzag indicator thinking I would never use it. After I re-installed it everything worked fine. I still have to manually kick start the indicator every time I open my MT4  
  
I am using "show 123 v2" indicator. What do you think of that indicator? Or, do you like the other 2 that you posted better?   
I like the V6 indicator and the "show 123 v2" although I do not use either with their default settings. The "show 123" is more flexible and has the capabilities of being tailored more and I think that for a novice it is very good as it "Reveals" more 123s which is good for the learning process, as long as the novice knows not to try and trade every 123. I am still undecided which one I like best so I am running both.

Yes I took the day off. Normally, for me at least, there is money to be made from Bernanke but as this was his second outing this week I thought it unlikely that he would say any thing that would move the market.  
  
I noticed you over on the TMS thread, I forgot to mention that the majority of them are trying to trade the 4hr charts. If you want something more relevant to the lower time frames, there is a thread called  
X-Man's Super Simple System  
<http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=327972>  
  
This method is identical to the TMS method except it has been adapted to the lower time frames, you will find that X-Man also has a 4hr method, ignore it.  
Phx62 and I spent quite a lot of time posting on that thread, the thread died when we stopped posting there but still has all the relevant information that you will need.

EU +27 +25 = 52pips. 2 straight forward 123 entries 1 short off Resistance and 1 long off Support. Both TPs were obvious, and today with small candles, over ambitious TPs would have been stupid.

Thanks for the information Dee , I want what everyone wants, a successful way of trading to keep me away from 9-5 Job and between markets psychology ,the tons of information which you still don't know if it is working or not I really feel completely lost and don't know where to start and what is the right track to reach a point to serve food on my table from trading, I thank you for all the help and insight that you provide.

That's Great!, I managed to take the first short trade like you did on a demo but and because I'm a chicken I got only 15 Pips which I'm totally happy with, it was a 123 simple and clear.  
as for the buy trade is there any other reason that you took buy from that area other than it's just a bounce from a support ? could the price break that area and make another 123 pattern for a downside ? don't you think it was early entry ?  
BTW :how did you define that support green line, did you do it by just looking at it or through an Indicator?

Congrats on the 15 pips![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)  
There is no such thing as "only X pips" any outcome that preserves or increases capital by any amount is a "winner"![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f973.png?v=15.1)  
  
Look at the chart more closely. How many candles tried to go lower at the BRN & S&R, did the price close, at any time below the BRN? When price spikes thru a level but does not actually close above/below it, it is an indication that price will move in the opposite direction. Look at the TDI and Stochastic had they both been in Over Sold?  
  
Could price have reversed after the entry and gone the other way. Of course. I can not predict what the market will do next, I can only make an educated guess and hope that I am right, if not my SL is there to protect me.  
  
How did I define that support line, look at a higher time frame as per the attached chart.  
  
Edit. One further point about the entry. The pullback from the 2 point of the 123, was held at the support level (BRN) same as the first trade where the pullback from point 2 was held at the resistance level. My experience has shown that if this happens the 123 will complete and price will move on enough to at least guarantee a breakeven.

Thanks Dee,  
  
You were right I "lost" the zig-zag indicator somewhere along the way, so I reinstalled it.  
I still can't get "V-6 to work for some reason" so I'am going to use "V-2". I think it  
has something to do with the range bar's set-up? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1) But it's all good...

aggression = 3  
rejectifhightlessthan=150(for 5 digit broker)  
  
I have not finished testing with the different switch settings.  
  
I also set the faildncolour & failupcolour to none, reduces the clutter on the chart.  
  
And reduce the maxbar setting, unless you are doing a lot of back testing. This reduces the load on your processor

Thanks Dee,  
  
Can you post your zig-zag indicator to make sure I'am using the correct  
one that feeds "V-6". Also, do you need the zig-zag indicator loaded on the  
chart for it to work or just in the file folder?  
  
I'am using:  
  
10 ema (blue) close  
200 ema (red) close  
800 ema (purple) close  
Standard-deviation channel  
FFS TP stoploss  
Round numbers  
gg-trendbar  
123 patterns (show 123 v2) set at 3 aggression & 150 rejectheight, 500 maxbars, yellow fail up/down color.  
  
Thanks for all your help and have a good weekend!

> Thanks Dee, Can you post your zig-zag indicator to make sure I'am using the correct one that feeds "V-6". Also, do you need the zig-zag indicator loaded on the chart for it to work or just in the file folder? I'am using: 10 ema (blue) close 200 ema (red) close 800 ema (purple) close Standard-deviation channel FFS TP stoploss Round numbers gg-trendbar 123 patterns (show 123 v2) set at 3 aggression & 150 rejectheight, 500 maxbars, yellow fail up/down color. Thanks for all your help and have a good weekend! snarlyjack {image}

Here is the ZigZag indi. You do not need to load it just have it in the indicator folder. There were other people that could not get v6 to work but I do not think that anyone was able to work out why. Try V 5 attached.

Hey Dee  
  
Thanks very much!!  
  
The settings you suggest on the 123 indi's really help me see the set ups much better.  
  
One last request, sometimes when visually back testing I will put the zig zag indi on  
  
What settings would you suggest for the zig zag indi?  
  
By the way, on a personal note, I see you are in Spain. My wife and I visited Madrid a few months back and we loved it.  
The architecture, the food, the art, the people, the food, did I mention the food.....and of course Spain does produce pretty good soccer players.

Thanks Dee,  
  
I appreciate the indicators & your help!  
I think I'll just stay with "show 123 V2".

Hooray Dee, I had two trades today from the same places that you took them, but as a newbie I was more than satisfied with 15 Pips each , I think I made a record here and I'm closer to your way of trading which I believe is great...... that means that I'm on the right track, right ?

It is a good start, congrats. 30 pips today was no mean achievement, well done.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1) how about posting a chart, encourage some of the others.

Sorry, missed your post. If you want to see the swing points V6 is using then you obviously need to use the same setting "3", but if you want to compare, try another setting 5 or 8 for example, it is a quick way of comparing settings. I have not looked at the code for show123 v2 so I am not sure what setting it is using.  
  
Spain. The cities are very different from where I live, I bought an Olive farm deep in the mountains and live among the country folk, they are a very different species altogether from the city folk.

I did this trade not based on 123 pattern but more like a hunch that at this resistance level with TDI confirming the direction.  
it seems that I can catch a good entry but I still need to work on my Exit points, I read in many places that greed is worst enemy in FX markets and that's why I'm conservative with exits, for the time being at this point of my learning curve I'm more than happy to have such results.

EU +20 pips. Counter Trend so a quick 20 TP was the 200 EMA on the 15 min. Entry was 123 on the 5min. Double Top with divergence and TDI cross to confirm entry. Divergence on 1hr, 15min and 5 min.

Hah.....well I can think of half of the reasons that you placed which made me think of them as a hunch but I couldn't explained them all as you did.... you are also a good teacher that can explain what is going on  
couldn't agree more with you that "hunch" should be excluded and work only logical, and to prove your point I made a mistake today using my stupid hunch.  
I entered with buy at a point with the following reasons : it's a long with up trend, above yesterday close, above a support and the price when touched the previous support it bounced sharply, and it was going to shape 123  
but it seems that it was not the case and since then the market dropped below that support forming a double top and reaching to yesterday's London session price and took off from there  
I hate to see my self losing so I took another buy to a average that position and closed both with 1pip loose.......That's great for me ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
if I waited another half an hour I wouldn't take that long position but it's a good lesson for today

Yesterdays final tally EU +20 +50 = 70 pips. By 17.00 my time PA just missed my TP so I decided to let it run, moved my stop upto just below the BRN and shut it down. As you can see it got there much later.  
  
Today EU +30. Took the 123 off the 5 min chart TP was the 161.8 Exp.

I entered with buy at a point with the following reasons : it's a long with up trend, above yesterday close, above a support and the price when touched the previous support...

One further thing, Look at the higher time frame in particular the 15min and 1 hr, in that order, that would have made you think twice before going long at that point because every thing was pointing down.

Yes, I understand this but take for example your trade today on 1H and 15M , the chart was pointing down, still though you took your trade based on 5M chart along with the trend and just a bout before the news time, is that correct ?

1hr and 15 min PA, TDI & Stochs were up, I entered at 09.15 gmt (10.15 my chart time) I entered using the 5 min to fine tune the entry, which also had a 123 along with the 15 min chart. News? what news? I pay no attention to news until after 8.30 NY time, if I worried about every news item marked in red on FF I would never trade, there would not be enough time between each news item. Any way I had already checked the expectations for the PMIs and they were expected to be positive, so no surprises there.

well...actually I was confused for little bit, your platform time showed the last time was 9:45 and I had the impression that you and me have the same time zone (+3GMT) and actually that spike with that price and time is 10:15 my platform time, anyway as usual I Learn a new information from you as I was under the impression that as a technical trader "which hopefully I will be ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) " I should stay a way from the news and I was really confused as I was always trying to get in the market after the news, that's why I didn't get any trade today but thanks for correcting me.

This might help a little with the news. The whole thing about avoiding the news, is to my mind, a crock of s_ _t, just another myth. I was told that if I abused myself to often I would go blind, 30 years later and after much enjoyment, I still have 20 - 20 vision. I have traded the news, successfully, for years. You just need to be aware of the pitfalls.

Thanks Dee, talking to you is fruitful as usual, and I believe an advice from a true trader like you who trade each day is better 100 times than who claims to be an educator or a mentor, you have been this markets for a long time .... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

EU +50 . News plus 123 +35= 85pips. 2 trades. 1st trade was a PA trade with TDI & Stochs confirmation. 2nd trade was a news trade using a 123 for the entry following the initial announcement. TP for the first trade was a sensible 50 pips just below the Resistance of todays high. I just rounded up the TP to 35 for the news trade, seemed logical to expect both trades to terminate in the same area.

EU +30. Straight forward 123 entry, visible on 5 and 15 min charts. Double Top and divergence on 1hr and 15min charts. TP confluence, 38% fibo of yesterdays low/high, BRN and S&R, 15 min 200 EMA just below. I am done for the day, sun is shining, birds are tweeting and I have a life beyond this monitor.

Yapee......I got the same trade with 25 Pips , as far as my reason was only double top along with 123 , target the next support and it worked ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
what I'm really happy for is that I'm taking the same trade with you " with the fact that I'm using nearly half of your logic because I'm still learning " , that means that I'm on the right track.....

Hello, Dee  
  
First, I appreciate your chart and knowledge sharing. It helps me a lot. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) I see you often use divergences on TDI. When it comes to Divergence, I thought using CCI is better. In your trading example today, TDI had a diverence (15m) while CCI didn't have. If you don't mind, could you please share your experience with TDI divergence? Is this better than anything others?  
  
Thanks

Short answer. No. The TDI indicator is made up of a Smoothed RSI and is therefore no more reliable than any other indicator for ascertaining Divergences. My preference for Divergence is the Stochastics, this is why I have it on my charts. Others will tell you the CCI, RSI or MACD etc. It is just a matter of preference and the settings used, I have used Stochastics for years on the setting 8,3,3 and have found it to be an extremely good indicator of divergences on the time frames I trade, it also shows me what stage of the price cycle we are in.  
  
The only way for you to decide which you prefer is to put a couple of them on a chart and make a direct comparison. Do a search on the web for alternate settings, many traders just use the default settings without realizing that those were the optimum settings when the indicator was first devised, since then then the market has changed.

Well done. Good analysis and execution.  
  
I know you are trying out the TMS method. here is a link to a trader who started with Big E, his pseudonym is "Dginc" he has mastered the TMS method and adapted it and built a site specifically to help other traders, his expertise, knowledge and wisdom are second to none.  
  
Start at this link. <http://www.protradenetwork.com/contact-me/>  
The link says "contact me" but it is also his "About me" page, I recommend you read this first before progressing to the rest of the site.

EU +20 pips. Slow slow market, Not a 123, but a Triple Top at the BRN 1.3300 was just begging for a quick (hah! 1.25hr) scalp. Counter Trend so a conservative 20pips. TP was confluence of the 200ema and trend line and short term S&R.

it seems that we share a lot Dee... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) and no wonder I felt lost today, I took the first sell early morning before london open and it went good for about 15 pip, then when london opened the market went back and took all so I ran a way with 1 pip... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f923.png?v=15.1)..., the second trade was good for 15 pips and I didn't want to be greedy, but look where the market went through after your and my close !

Dee, how do you decide whether to take only longs or shorts? Just looking at what side of the 200 EMA price is on?

EU +20 pip scalp. Nice straight forward 123 off Support, a quick 10 min scalp, just how I like them. My initial TP was a measured move using the Expansion tool, but when divergence formed at the BRN on the 1hr and 15min I took my pips.

I take Trend and Counter trend trades often one following the other. I am more interested in how a trade sets up, is it off the high or low of the day, S&R, Fib level, that is more important than the Trend. Take today for instance. The 200 ema on the 15 min is flat but on the 1hr it is up does that mean I will take only longs, no, at the moment Price has once again stalled at the BRN 1.3300, so despite what the Moving averages are saying I am keeping my eyes open for a possible short. 

Cut your Losers short and let your Winners run.

I don't know why I feel stupid today, whenever I wake up early I loose patience during the day .  
I took the first long today before london open and it was a nice 123 straight and forward and I was happy with those 14 pips, then I noticed that it's a continuation and I took another long, now here is what I think my problem is that I loos patience when I see there is a drawback......well I closed the trade with -12 pip so I got 2 pips for today.  
I think I need to work more on discipline and trading psychology.......and stop waking up early ! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f634.png?v=15.1)

You need a kick up the a _ _ e. You went long when your TDI was OB and out side the bands, your stochastic was OB and starting to slope down. If you had zoomed out you would have seen that Price was at a congestion level and was likely to stall. Being impatient is one thing, being irrational is another![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44e.png?v=15.1) You know better than that.

Dee,  
  
I've been watching this thread for a while, and your posts are so inspirational to young, aspiring traders such as myself. I aspire to be as good of a daytrader as you.  
  
If its not too much to ask, could you tell us more about yourself?  
  
Do you trade for a living, ect?  
  
I'd even urge you to make your own thread. This thread is dead, and the only reason I stay on it all day, is to hopefully catch your posts.   
  
Thanks.

Yah I know , I deserve it, I'm not sure exactly but I can tell you that at the time when I took the first trade TDI was in band and everything looked fine ,but I thought of more like price action as the price bounced off from a support and it was a 123, so I thought it was good to try it,  
I admit that the second trade was a mistake and I should look into the big picture and obsessively TDI, first

If you see this post in time, you can catch the double top that just formed on USDCAD 1H chart. 123 formation forming on 5 minute.  
  
Bearish divergence on 1H too.  
  
EDIT: And even after all that, price still went against me after the 123, Dammit.  
  
EDIT2: Just found out it was because I went short right next to a FIB retracement level. Should have remembered to plot it.

EU +45. 123 +News entry. I got back in time for this one. 123 off former resistance after a Double Top with Divergence on the 4hr and 1hr charts, had I been here I would definitely have taken that trade, but, took an early entry following the news ADP and GDP. TP was confluence of 1hr 200 EMA and 61.8% Fibo this was also a minor S&R but I did not mark it up.  
  
Hope you all took a bite at these trades as they were perfect set ups.

Dee,  
  
I have been marking yesterday's low-high using fib levels as you do.   
  
  
Are there any other levels I should mark? Do you do the last week's low-high? Or is this all?

I do the previous day H/L. And I look for Fibo confluences otherwise known as Fibo clusters. The attached PDFs are excerpts from a book by Carolyn Boroden alias the Fibonacci Queen, this is one trading book that I highly recommend buying.  
  
PS. I will deal with your question about myself later, probably at the weekend as I am pushed for time at the moment.

yesterday I tried 2 trades, what an idiot I was. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f62b.png?v=15.1) Price had been in a 30 pip range, so what did I do? I went for a 40 pip target, as you can see I broke even twice for 2 pips each. The only redeeming feature of those 2 trades was that I moved my SL to B/E after 10 pips. BUT, I should have known better, I should only have gone for 20 pips each trade especially the second trade as resistance was quite obviously the 200 EMA and the trade was counter trend. The first trade target should have been the BRN 1.3200. Lack of concentration on my part cost me 40 pips. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61e.png?v=15.1) Will I do it again? Probably, I am only human.

Do you really trade the news this way........cheeez at this point whenever I see news I still remove my fingers from the mouse![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f923.png?v=15.1)...  
I'll give a try today and see how it goes , would the price get slipped during these times or do you used pending orders to avoid that ?

Waw , were you able to trade yesterday with all of these news and choppy price ? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61f.png?v=15.1) I was barely able to take one trade and lost 10 pips , the market was crazy with no clear sentiment or any bias , I see it great to have positive pips with such situations ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/270c-fe0f.png?v=15.1)

Dee,  
  
I have saved all those PDFs, and have been studying them and applying them, but my charts just end up getting complicated and cluttered.  
  
  
  
I'd REALLY appreciate it if you could lay out how exactly you plot all of your S/R fib lines, so that I could replicate it.  
  
I have been replicating your daytrading style, and am loving it, and would GREATLY appreciate it if you could take a moment to explain how you plot all your fib levels.  
  
  
I already fully understand how to do yesterdays swing low-high with retracement, but if you could tell me the rest of the fibs you plot, I would really appreciate it.  
  
  
  
  
So far, I look for the following:  
  
1\. TDI Cross on 15 min chart is a must.  
2\. Divergence on 15m/1H (optional).  
3\. Candle formations (Double top/bottom, 123break pattern).  
4\. Patterns must be off S/R zones such as fibs of last days swing low-high, and BRN.  
5\. Must be going from oversold/overbought to opposite.  
6\. Candle must close before entering trade.  
  
  
Anything I am missing or could add on?  
  
  
I am a newbie, and have been trying to find a strategy that suits me for a year now, but I am confident I have found it, and with your help, I could get it 100% right, as you have.  
  
Thank you.  
  
EDIT: I also understand the concept of fib extensions and expansions as explain in the PDFs, but am confused how to apply them to this type of trading. Can you show me an example, of how you would use them?

Congretulations! Really a good job. By the way, do you really see candle patterns at 5m chart? Is this reliable?

Patterns are reliable, individual candles not so much, but, if you looked at the 15 min chart yesterday you would have seen the Pin Bar forming at the same time.

So far today EU +45. Another 15min Pin Bar backed up by a massive 1hr Pin Bar and a 123 on the 5min to confirm entry. Look and you will see. The TP was a little difficult to judge and I had to go to the 4hr chart to find a suitable target, none the less, ultimately it was the oscillators going into OB that made me pull the plug. Backed up by Divergence and at a push a Double Top.

Thank you Dee. I know some people see pin bars very profitable, but I need more excercise using this candle. Thank you anyway. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

> So far today EU +45. Another 15min Pin Bar backed up by a massive 1hr Pin Bar and a 123 on the 5min to confirm entry. Look and you will see. The TP was a little difficult to judge and I had to go to the 4hr chart to find a suitable target, none the less, ultimately it was the oscillators going into OB that made me pull the plug. Backed up by Divergence and at a push a Double Top. {image}

Great Job Dee, I I thought that you took yesterday off since you didn't post your trades till today ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
\- I have just one question : there were some opportunists for 123 pattern to be sold for today , but still you didn't take them , do you define your bias for the day and try to find entries that matches your expectation for the direction ?

Sorry but I do not have much time available at the moment for responding. I do not spend my entire day watching the monitor. I have 2 alarms that I set one is time based and the other is Price based, When either sounds I return to the screen and have a look.

I am getting these results because I do not watch the market all the time. I do not get sucked in to taking a trade that is not really there, the longer you look at something the more detail you will see, real and imagined.

you are taking the words out of my mouth , I noticed that watching the market for long time I start to see and build relations that are not logical and at the same time I start to jump in at the first signal that's why I got some loses this week, I understood from you that I need glue my self to the monitor for a long time before reaching the point that you are already in , but I see my self starting to see and draw imaginary lines, trends and non sens trades ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f643.png?v=15.1) , Hah.....does this has a cure ?

EU +20 +20. Not a 123 in sight, sorry. But a good example of trading a Range using TF trend to dictate direction. Taking shorts off resistance backed up by Divergence. Take sensible profit within the range, identified by support.  
  
Hope it helps.

GU +60. 123 Entry, but entered a little earlier using the TTE because Support (200 EMA) was hit 6 times. TP was near base of Pin Bar, for obvious reasons. Nice trade but still only worth 30 real pips.

EU +22 +30. There were 2 123 patterns, one within the other on the 15 min chart, but I waited for the news which as fate would have it occurred right on the entry point for the second 123. Just 20 pips away was yesterdays high so I took one off at that point and targeted the 89% fib with another. The news was not strong so I doubted that price would move to far.

Dee do you only trade the eu? If so, what do you do on the days where there aren't any good 123 patterns?

Looking back at my last few posts you will see that I resorted back to Price Action trading. 123 is a good method to use but you should always have an alternative, I use 123, Price Action and for a couple of years now I also use the TMS (TDI) method or a combination of all 3.

I took two trades today, but I saw well over 4 over good trades I could of took but I didn't want to over trade ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1). The first trade is eur/jpy.. notice how the market spiked up but couldn't make a new high so I shorted that..

EU +35. 123 entry off the 5min chart. Taken 1 off at the 123.8% Fibo, final TP is just the other side of the BRN at the 161.8% Fibo. Price just missed my Final TP but SL is now at BE +12pips.

Nice work Dee... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
I noticed that there were also 123 pattern before the news at 10:00 AM and the move looked like going up and went there for about 15 pips , still though you didn't take trade , do you set your bias for the day let's say that you would think sell for today and then look for signals that are confirming your thinking ?

Closed my last one for +40. Pin Bar had formed off Support BRN, missed my final TP by just 2 pips, but Pin Bar at BRN and OS on the oscillators says "take what you have and be grateful"

EU +20 News Trade. This is why I like news trading, 20 pips in as many seconds. As long as you remain realistic about your TPs news trading can be very profitable.

One of the reasons I have not started a new thread on 123 trading is because it has already all been covered many times over. Most people are too lazy to search the forum for existing information, so, as this morning is very slow I have spent a few hours putting together a PDF of posts by "Paulus" from another thread. If this does not provide enough insight in how to trade the 123s then you should move on to another method.  
  
Hope it helps.

EU +25 +12. First trade was a 123 entry from the 5min chart TP was top of "anticipated Range". 2nd trade was a little more difficult because the BRN 3350 was in the center of the range and the number 2 point had formed on a Pin Bar thru the BRN, so, did I wait for price to break the bottom of the pin bar which would not give enough pips to the bottom of the range or, did I take a TTE for a scalp of just 12 pips or, did I pass. I opted for a TTE after price broke thru the BRN, for a quick 12pips. Was it worth it, in hindsight I should not have bothered I made the cardinal mistake of taking a dubious setup because I was bored.

it seems I'm on the way of cloning your way Dee..... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) , I took the first trade as you did but on GU as I thought the news for that pair would be more effective , I got long for 25 pips which I'm very happy with them , the second trade I entered short on EU after the pin because I saw BEEB on normal CS , I saw the pin par and said to my self " Dee will kill me if he sees me taking that trade.... " so I closed it winning 1 pip and you were right .......![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

EU +55 +21. I did not take the breakout short first thing this morning, it happened much too quickly for me, so I sat back and waited for PA to hit S&R at 3320, then I waited for a 123 to form, there was one within an hour but there was not much air between the 2 & 3 point so, I waited. A shapely 123 did form and I took an early TTE entry, multiple choice TPs so I put the TP just below the BRN 1.3400 and trailed the stop. Market just ran out of momentum at the BRN so I took a quick scalp Fade Trade for +21. Today was a No News Day, in other words ignore all those little bits of useless data and just follow the PA.

You rock Dee....... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/270c-fe0f.png?v=15.1) just right to the point, we just need to cut the B.S about news as the market today moved exactly the opposite of the news which was marked with red on FF confusing everyone, just PA and trade what you see is the key , KISS " keep it simple and stupid " will give you Pips with peace of mind !

EU +34. You have to be really patient and wait. Nice 123 TTE entry off Resistance and 50 EMA. TP was confluence of BRN, 100% Fib, 200% Fib Exp and in that area a Daily S&R. Some what meager pickings today, but I am out and gone. Adios.

Patience is a virtue, but combine that with knowledge and your losses will diminish. It is one thing to be a great technical analyst, but sentiment is also a powerful short term driver of the markets!. As day traders we need to be aware of the sentiment as it can move the market in the opposite direction to the technicals. Here are 2 reports that can help you, I have posted these before, but my daily pre trade routine is  
  
1\. Read and download the Danske Technical Update and the Danske Daily Update.[http://www.worldwidereaction.com/smi...work/7_6_8.gif](http://www.worldwidereaction.com/smileys/images/smileys/work/7_6_8.gif)  
2\. Check FF Trading calendar for timing of News.  
3\. Open my charts check the sentiment against technicals.  
4\. Make Pips.  
  
Hope it helps

Yesterday I took one trade EU +20. It was an excruciating trade that took 3 hours for just 20 pips. The 123 looked good as it was combined with a Triple top off Resistance and justified an early TTE entry, the 161.8% Fib Exp only gave 20 pips but initially it looked like it would get there quite quickly. I identified a Daily S&R at 1.3180 and put my TP there, but 3 hours later we were coming to the end of my trading day and price had still not gotten to the 161.8% exp, so I moved my TP up to the 161.8% and settled for 20pips. Had I not intervened it would have been 35pips as price did make it down to the Daily S&R.  
  
Lesson for the day was. "Do not bugger about with your TPs, set it and leave it!!" If in doubt trail your stop!!

EU +20. 123 on the 5min. But Pin Bar on the 1hr off resistance & the 4hr remains in OS so momentum is down, but caution is required so only a small TP. Divergence on the 1hr & 15min confirms exit

Another couple of trades from the news. EU +30. +22. First trade was a Gap Fill trade, waited for the gap to be filled, then entered short following the positive dollar sentiment TP was between the 127 & 161 Fib exp. second trade I could not resist. Pin Bar rejection off the 50 ema. TP was same place as first trade, nice finish to the day.

That is a very lazy question![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44e.png?v=15.1) you only need to look back at the last 3 pages of this thread to find an answer to that, I have just done it, it took only 2 minutes. And I have already answered the same question several times earlier in the thread.

EU +40. 123 entry off Support. TP was yesterdays High and S&R and 50% Fib, this formed Double Top confirming exit, oscillators also confirmed. Did not trade yesterday because the 4hr was saying go long, the 1hr and 15 min did not agree, sentiment was unclear due to both the EU and US data being positive and so under those circumstances it was best to do nothing.

You always make it sound easy and simple .....and what's important just right into the Bulls eye ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1).

EU +50. News trade. Draghi is guaranteed at least 50.It looks like it may fall more, but I would have to trail stop to carry on and chances are that price would just come back and I would only gain a couple more pips so I have learnt to take what I want and leave some for the others.

I can see that the 4H says up and 1H also says the same, the problem is with 15M I see it distorted till the end of the day then it got cleared for long, but by that time London session would end and most traders would give up at the end of the day, I'm getting that right ?

EU NFP +105. Standard catch it and run, followed by the usual Fade Trade. The third entry was actually a 123, ignore the big wicks and take the entry as price moved over the BRN 3150, if you look closely you will see a 123 inside a 123 as price hit the BRN twice before crossing over. All in All I love the big news days you can make a weeks worth of pips in a couple of hours.

Thanks for the compliments guys, but what I did was not clever or magic. Have a look at the attached 1 minute chart, the first entry was no more skillful than entering as fast as I could following the announcement, the other 2 entries were just a matter of reacting to PA and what the oscillators were telling me.

I think that this might provide an answer for you. [http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...34#post5155334](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5155334#post5155334)

because you appear to be asking questions that you should not be, if you had grasped the basics of what a 123 is.

blue points LOST ?  
  
A correct 123-break pattern is made invalid when price breaks back above #3 !

I did not take this trade, I am some what lazy monday mornings. However, it does provide me with an opportunity to show you how you can use another pattern along with your 123, to determine the most likely place to take Profit. In this instance it is a Pennant pattern. PDF attached explaining the Pennant.  
  
The 1-2 leg formed as part of the LO Fake out, the 2-3 leg pulled back to the TL Base of the Pennant, the early entry would have been as price broke thru the top of the Pennant for the second time, this would have given a 45 pip trade, the standard entry on the break of point 2 would have given 35ish pips.  
  
There are a number of clues as to where price was likely to go. The confluence of Daily S&R and 50% fib & previous area of Resistance just a little lower.  
  
Confluence of the 161.8% Fib exp and BRN 1.3200, this would only have given 15ish pips.  
  
Using a measured move, Market Harmonics, this would have confirmed the most likely TP area was the confluence of Daily S&R, 50% Fib and previous Resistance.

EU +21 +15. First trade 123 entry off 1hr and 15 min. second trade was a news trade which despite the numbers being good went no where as news came out about 2 states not having accurate figures. What are they on about, since when have any government figures been accurate? have they never heard about the statisticians favorite tool, the Weighted Average.

I'm not sure how do you do it but you milk every swing as if you already travel in time and read the price where it's heading and where it's going to turn back..... that's cool Dee ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60e.png?v=15.1)

EU +40. I had no idea that the Spanish were going to announce that they haven´t got a clue how to run their economy, but my grateful thanks to them, I do not have to wait for price to hit my TP.  
  
No brainer trade, Multiple Tops, Multiple Bottoms, we are in a range. Strong Divergence, price was only going one way, back down. With Spanish help it happened much quicker.

Hi everyone, and thanks for the thread. I've downloaded the 123 patterns indicator a year ago, but could start using it pretty recently. I've tried to go through the posts, however, there is quite a lot. I've seen that there has been an alert coded for the v6 version, but the alert goes off quite often for me. My question is that has there been an alert coded for the v6 that only signals the appearance of the arrows, instead of alerting me of every price action move that goes below/above the recent high/low?  
  
Thank you for the answer, and happy green pips for everyone.

Sorry for the delay in answering, have been on another thread picking up a few tips to improve things over here. In answer to your question. I use home page of FF and Forexlive, [Forex News | Currency News by ForexLive](http://www.forexlive.com/)  
  
I also use the direct government links for various reports or data. There are live news feeds, subscription, but generally I have not found them to be much faster than the free services.

You have to change to V7 for an updated alarm. or. change "zigzag depth" from 1 to a higher number, Robdee the originator actually used a setting of 12. But you also need to remember that the alarm on V6 was an early warning, if you want an alarm as the arrow forms to indicate the cross of the 2 point youre entry will be late, which depending on momentum might only be a couple of pips to 10 pips or more.

here you are the indicator was made for a numerical GAN & and something like this but i found it useful for all kind and respected by all price action   
for me i mix it with my strategies   
for PA   
scalp 123 5&15 min   
4 & 1 HR TMS  
for Daily 3SS & D1 20-50  
  
the number is where the price make its rest and stay for a long time monthly (main trend Up & down )   
then the smallest wave at weekly and daily has own stops and place to take a rest and pullback or reverse ....PA etc..  
on daily & lower is very very small waves inside the weekly wave that inside and part of the main wave at monthly wave   
  
  
sorry for my English   
i tried to explain in images

Hi guys! Good stuff here. 123 is perfect pattern. But it has one huge disadvantage, at last from my point of view, and unfortunately I could not manage with this. It has poor RR ratio.

In all honesty, I struggle to believe that anyone in this thread is making money trading the 123 pattern.  
  
Anyone who has tried it knows how horribly low the success rate is, even when used off of S/R.  
  
But to each his own. If it works for you, then it works for you.

...yes, TEBs recently revived 1.2.3. thread, will help improve the 123 win rate considerably.

123 does not work!!!! No One makes money from 123!!!!  
  
Here is an example of 4 trades this morning, all started from well defined S&R levels, with average R:R 1:2 using the 200 Target level as defined by TEB´s method. When price comes within a couple of pips of the 200 move SL to B/E (no R:R) free trade. SL goes initially above/below the 3 point.  
  
This is my futures platform so the pairs are clockwise. EU, GU, AU and Yen $ (UJ)  
  
If you have not yet done so, go look at TEB´s thread, just bare in mind that the thread started and ended in 2008 when all pairs had a much greater daily range, so you need to adjust your expectations for today´s market.

EU +24 +50. AU +35. It has been a good morning for V6. Took a bit of heat on EU, Finger started twitching on the mouse button but resisted the urge to close came very close to my SL but that is what it is there for.

I just went through the whole thread.  
  
Dee, if you were doing so well (which it seems like you were), then why are you switching your strategy so drastically?  
  
Your scrapped your old strategy, added a couple of MA's and said "He took my trading to the next level". I really can't tell if you're being serious or not.  
  
I even remember you saying you don't have losses anymore.  
  
I find this really hard to believe.  
  
  
It seems like the newbies in this thread are having the piss taken out of them.

Do you want me to point out to everyone just how many systems you have been in, and started off by calling the OP "my friend" to grease your way in, only to not be profitable within about 10 days and then you degenerate into calling the system rubbish, and eventually to tell the OP that he is a liar? I have read all of your posts, and I can back up what I'm saying. Do you want me to produce the posts where you laughed like a hyena because you had 'cracked this FX thing', and "no broker was going to get any more of your money"......only to come back a few weeks later, cap in hand and start (yet) another thread where you're virtually begging for help? Do you want me to do that?  
  
FX trading isn't for you, you are a persistent loser at FX trading and you are in no position to judge what works and what doesn't, because EVERYTHING you have tried, you have failed at. But you blame the system and eventually blame the system developer and not yourself. YOU are the reason you keep failing, and you still expect to download a system, spend 10 - 20 days (maximum) and expect to be rolling in more money that scrooge mcduck.  
  
  
I have no idea if this system works *for me* or not, but I do know that dee50 has more skill and experience that you can dream about. If this system, like every other system BAR NONE that you have 'tested' (for not more that 20 days ROFL), doesn't work for you, then MOVE ON. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44e.png?v=15.1)

EU +30 +50. 2x 123 entries on the 1Hr chart. one within the other, entered 1 lot on the first and 1 lot on the second. First TP was the 200, second TP was for 50pips just over the BRN 3550. Four bounces off the 38.2% Fibo confirmed it as support. So, not a difficult decision.

I enter all my trades manually. There are a number of EAs here on FF for automating trades but I personally have never used any of them, Cavemanager was one that PHx62 uses on the Trading Made Simple thread.

I'm trying to learn this system.  
  
What you think about using regular fractals (5 candles) to spot 123?   
  
A fractal of 3 candles is enough to be considered a max/min?  
  
Hope to be clear with my poor english

I think you would be better off using the standard Zig Zag indicator, visually it provides a much better indication of the 123 pattern, I know TEB63 uses the standard fractal indicator I personally find that the fractal indicators are too busy and you will struggle to identify 123s, however, I found a fractal indicator that is adjustable, play around and see what works for you.

Nice early entry. can you explain your reasons for taking the entry so early, rather than on the break of the number 2 point? It would be really helpful. Thanks

Hope this has not been answered previously. I did read the thread, but rather quickly. Have a great deal of confidence in 123Pattern trading... Question, looks to me that there are some missing,"dots," in 123PatternsV6 chart. A Buy is signaled at one point, but the set up pattern is not shown. Changing to 123PatternsV5 indicator no Buy signal is given. Any input will be greatly appreciated. Anyone... dee50, hoping for your input on this.

An arrow without dots means it's a distorted pattern. It means it's not exactly how a 'perfect' 1-2-3 pattern should look like, but it's close to it.

Hi handy,  
  
i always do every thing my self, i stick to 15 mns chart and only main pairs eur/usd, usd/cad,nzd/usd, aud/usd and gnb/usd whenever i see 1 and 2 points i use fib and write 3 myself around 50 to 38.2 fib. then i start looking for price action at these levels like pin bar, enguling candels..   
  
hope this helps you.

Not regularly i just put to see how it looks, but i close the trade at 1 :1 RR.. but i think to be a smart trader you have to be one step ahead from price...

For over 5 years now I have only traded the eurusd, it has only been in the last couple of weeks that I have decided to watch and trade the EJ, AU,UJ and GU as well, mainly because the daily range has been so small on the EU it has been difficult to make enough pips to justify getting out of bed.

EU +40 123 entry on the 1hr. TP was the 38% fib and recent S&R level. Set it, move stop to B/E and leave it. For my part I went out and cleared my vegetable patch of the summer plants and started getting it ready for the winter crop.

GU +70. The 123 occurred earlier outside my trading time, but the angle of the MAs showed good momentum so I took the trade once price broke below the S&R level. Targeted the 200 even though there was an S&R level just below. Do not be greedy take the pips where you are most likely to get them, you lose less and gain more. I can not get excited about the GU as the pips are only worth half, so 70 sounds good but it is really only 35.  
  
Have a good weekend

Simple. HTF 4hr. also the next 1 was part of consolidation not a swing point. I have said this before but I will say it again, the indicators are an aid to learning to recognize 123s, I personally do not use them to make trade decisions.

Would you, or anyone, be kind enough to share?  
  
I am trying to build an EA myself and feel that "123 patterns" should be at the core of it.

The EA I mentioned are MPTM, THV Cavemanager, Swiss Army EA.  
These are good EAs for trade management.  
But you have to decide on the trade entry trigger using the 123 pattern.

Yes. I took TEB63s method of determining the TP, I used this to replace the 161.8% fib expansion that I used before, although if you place both on a chart you will find that there is not much difference between the two. And I use TEBs MAs on the EU 5 min chart and on the other pairs that I trade. I have kept my EU charts the same because I still trade the TMS method as well and I see no reason to have lots of different charts open when I do not need to.

You hit the 200, you just needed to draw your fibs in the right place. Plus, look for the S&R levels these will give you confirmation of your TPs. Price will go to the S&R levels more often than it will go to the 200, why? Because the S&R level is Factual, price has been there before and thousands of traders are viewing them, the 200 level is a theoretical level that is only observed by people using it. In this instance the 200 was a good level for TP because it was close to the S&R level.

The area of the 200 is more realistic, the 61.8% Fib retracement coincides with a previous area of support, just below that the 78.6% Fib retracement coincides with a HTF S&R level. The 300 is a longer term possibility, so your TP depends on how long you want to wait.

you know , I also like your method and try to clone it , combining TMS with specializing in one pair would enhance the chances on it, at least you would have only one pair to focus on and have a better chances with it plus it's less stressful on the long run....

EU is a bitch at the moment, very small daily range that is why I have started monitoring EJ UJ AU GU, on the 1 hr TF, they are not always better but EJ and UJ have slightly larger ranges at the moment. I find GU generally has decent moves but I try to keep that in perspective as GU has a lesser $ value per pip.

All TFs. Do not bother showing the Ross Hooks, I never saw the point of them. I also set maxbars to 100, puts less strain on the processor, you only need a greater number than this if you are back testing.

I need to start just selecting A+ trades. This was still an overall profit, but in hindsight shouldn't have entered when I did.

EU +55. 123 Entry on 15 min chart but TP based on 1 hr 123 and confluence of BRN and 200 Exp. Do not know what caused the spike down but it means I do not have to be around all day, I am done.  
  
GU +40. Not a 123 but a lovely Pin Bar with divergence at resistance, it does not get any more inviting than this. Thanks to Jankone and Ryan they made me aware of the Pin Bar![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

I am not going to respond to all your charts individually, but here are a couple of examples of what you seem to be missing. I am not sure what dictates your entry points, it is almost as if you are following another method other than 123.

GU +50 +41. Straight forward 123 from strong S&R, but Long Tail on the 1-2 leg, no sentiment today until Draghi this evening, so realistic 50 pip Target, had a second runner just in case but closed it as we are going into consolidation, maybe even a reversal.

EU +44 +70.  
GU +50 +100  
  
"Focusonmoney" See the lines on my charts, see what price level they are at, now draw the same lines on your chart and scroll back, what do you see happening when price hits the line. Practice looking for levels, after some time it becomes much easier. Start on the Daily, then change down to the 4Hr, then to the 1Hr. Use the 1hr and 15min for your short term S&R levels. Another way is zoom out, you will see the levels much more easily, they actually become obvious when you zoom out.

This morning I used Market Orders, I opened the charts saw the trades and entered. Other times I use pending orders, depends on how the PA is setting up. If I am not sure I wait and use a market order. If the pattern looks good and the entry point is not near a major level I will use a Pending order. Sorry, does not help much does it? but I am a Discretionary Trader.

That's great Dee, I knew that you will beat the market today, I took today the same entries like you did , but my problem is the same I can't wait for the right exit , I still work on Demo which I treat like real, whenever I have few pips I just close the orders and when I look few hours later to see the market I start to hit my head into the wall, whenever I have a loosing trade I wait for days to minimize the loose , but for a winning trade few pips would make me want to run a way with them like a jerk !  
I know that patience is a virtue but I cannot be patient unless I'm loosing.....Dah... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f624.png?v=15.1)

Welcome to the club. Same problem for every one. In fact it is the single biggest reason for many traders failing!!! The only way to overcome this problem is through confidence, you develop the confidence over time to set your target and leave it alone. I am concerned that you will not take a loss and hold on to a losing trade trying to mitigate your loss, that is the road to ruin, cut your losses short and re enter, if you panicked to soon. Or take a smaller position size, one that does not hurt so much

Aha.... so I'm not a lone in this and it's the human nature and the only way to overcome this is by experience !! it's strange that we all live in a world of uncertainty and we accept it , but when it comes to money and known loose we start to run away.  
it's good to know that it's not only me and building confidence over time will not consume all the capital " I hope " , I agree with you that it's better to cut your losses and re enter.  
Thanks Dee...... you are the best !

Good Way to go Dee , since EU had a big move yesterday, it's wise to stay a way from it for today , I can see that you are have moving averages all over the charts , do you rely on them as targets ?

I do not have many MAs. Using the TEB method, 100 EMA 30 EMA 5 EMA. On my EU charts 50 EMA 200 EMA. I only use the 200 EMA as a potential target because so many pro traders have that on their charts and it usually forms S&R because of this. If an ema is part of confluence, then yes it is a target or it is part of the target. Any other time I TP at or near an MA it is coincidence and there is usually another more pertinent reason for taking profit in that area.

This weeks EU trades. +235 pips. NFP was very generous to me, I was in the market prior to the announcement, with a very small 10 pip SL, so the gap up was very beneficial to me. The rest of the week was extremely bitty, so I set my TPs at realistic points. Today, to alleviate the boredom of trading, I am going to watch the paint dry on my walls and maybe count how many grains of rice there are in a 1Kg bag.

When does Price hit the Session Day´s High or Low??. Do you care?? As Day Traders you should! If I need to explain why then you should not be reading this.  
  
Here is a link to Thomas Bulkowski´s site where he conducted a study, the results are interesting. Bare in mind this is stocks, the results will be slightly different for Forex and for each pair, but it is not difficult to do a simple back test. Remember you need to test the times when you are awake and trading so that the results are relevant to you, to often I see backtest results covering 24/5, fine if you are an algorithm that never sleeps.

Yah, I like Pin Bar at support or resistance, it looks pretty much reliable , also other forms have a better probability at that area.

The reason I used this site as an example is because he is one of the few Analysts who has actually done the research and listed the Success and Failure rates for candle patterns, too many people talk about candlesticks and Patterns as if they were a foregone conclusion whereas the reality is very different!!! The Pin Bar on it´s own only signals a reversal 59% - 60% of the time, however Bulkowski did not test the Pin Bar at S&R levels had he done so he would have found a significant difference in the predictive success rate! So you are correct in choosing the Pin Bar (Reversal Bar) at S&R.  
  
Bulkowski´s analysis of a 123 Pattern, although different to how we use it, he uses a trend line in the pattern, shows that this pattern confirms a trend change 73% of the time. My own analysis in Forex, puts this figure at closer to 86%.  
  
<http://thepatternsite.com/123tc.html>  
  
His analysis of an ABC correction (Measured Move) is closest to our 123. But he actually Analised each leg of the Pattern and evaluated the success rate of a 100% expansion. Check out the "Measured Move Up Trading Tips"  
  
<http://thepatternsite.com/mmu.html>  
  
"The measure rule predicts a price target! This works 83% of the time in a Bull market and 93% in a Bear market

I'm not sure but I feel that his version of 123 matches the broken trend strategy, is that right ?  
also his ABC matches the harmonic version of AB= CD or 100% fibo expansion

Not until we get some confirmation. Remember technically we are still in an uptrend and have not yet completed the move to 1.3850 - 70 ish. Plus dollar news was negative, I am erring on the side of caution.  
  
Edit.  
2 consecutive Pin Bars have formed on the 15 min, but just below them is a BRN 1.3800, so it is tempting to fade this move but I would wait to see if the BRN becomes support.

Here is the round number indi.  
Looks like we should have gone short EU, but then Hindsight is 20/20 vision. I still would not have expected price to completely reverse, did I miss some news?

I stopped using them about 12 months ago, and concentrate more on the S&R levels. There was some research done on the effectiveness of Pivots I can not find it at the moment but I will try and find it tomorrow, it is supper time here.

EU +88. Yesterdays EU trade, straight forward 123 entry signaled on the 1hr and 15min. There where 2 possible targets, confluence of the 200% Exp and BRN 1.3500 or confluence of the 78% Fib Ret and BRN 1.3550, I opted for the first because there was a S&R level just below. Easy choice for the trade just look at the angle of the TDI and the MAs showing very strong downward momentum.

EU looks compelling for a CT trade, we have 15 min very nice Pin Bar at support with divergence, BUT the 1hr does not agree, so I will wait for confirmation.

my reasons were, 123 off support and off BRN, TDI on 15M were green over red over MBL, 1H TDI also were crossed up at that time but below MBL.  
I know that this is a CT and have a higher risk than with the trend but in many cases CT trades went fine,I found that CT are fine when there is a trading range not when a strong trend starts to roll, as you said there were a lot of broken Pin bars later that were broken which indicates that CT trades are not advisable at that time  
Thanks to the help Dee.  
Cheers

Hi Dee,  
  
Would you have considered this one on EJ?  
1 hr inside bar with bullish divergence at the 61.8 retrace of the move up from 8th Oct to 22nd Oct.  
Also 132.627 support from 15th Oct low.  
  
15 min retraced but did not close below the 78.6%. Didn't make it back to the previous high but possibly good for 20?

Hi Ian sorry I did not respond. You are right waiting for a better entry did pay off. +35. Here is what I saw. I am not a big fan of Inside Bars and I prefer to see the TDI come out of the OB/OS areas, also I do not take any notice of divergences that occur inside the OB/OS zones, part of the divergence has to be outside the zone especially after such a strong and determined move.  
  
Also  
UJ +40. A BPC entry after short term S&R level broken confirming continuation of the longer term trend.

I am disappointed, I had hoped that some one would challenge me and even slap my wrist for considering a CT trade in such a strong down trend. The term "Catch a Falling Knife" has been used often. However, caution was justified when another Pin Bar confirmed reversal back into trend. I did not take that signal because Support 1.3500 was only 20 pips away and the candles were getting smaller, there was also a rumor of a large offer at the Bid at 1.3500 which had the potential to turn around and bite you on the arse.

I am not a Fortune Teller, I do not have a crystal ball, sorry, I am a Historian, I use Hindsight to guess where price may go, what has been will come again. The market repeats it´s self over and over again, I just look left and ask myself "where do you think it will go"? "What supports that"? Confluence, Fibs, S&R, MAs etc. Where this becomes difficult is when the market makes a historical high/Low and you have to resort to a purely technical assessment because there is no information to the left!

Yah, I know that I'm just kidding . I don't think that you are historian, because this would mean that history teachers would be leaders in everything in this world including this market, which is for sorry not the case.  
the debate that you start between you and your self before every trade for where and when and compiling that logic based on your history or what you trained your eye to see makes that trade good , at the end Good Job Dee !![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Well, I did see that and saw that also you and many others did take many counter trend trades many times, it seems that counter trend targets have always to be small targets and should always have the stop at the breakeven even if a good entry is there...... or just always follow your friend " Trend " and have less headache !  
  
hope that you had some fun while a way ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

EU. +77 +50 +60 +50 +30 +25 +35 +30

My trades for the week. Due to the market I had to depend on S&R, 123 and TDI so there are a mix of entry types on the charts, for that reason I have not explained the entries on the charts, but most of the entries were 123 & S&R combinations.  
  
I have found an interesting sessions marker which includes Total pips for each session. I normally trade from 9 - 5 GMT +1 and I found it useful to know how many pips were in each session rather than total daily pips, it helped provide a more realistic expectation of what I could expect to gain each day as a Day Trader. If I was Swing trader then that knowledge would be irrelevant.  
  
To set it up just enter your session start and end times based on your broker times, eg. My broker is GMT +2 so my session times are 10.00 - 18.00.  
F8 on the chart and select "show object descriptions" to show the session pips.  
When scrolling back you may get some elongated session boxes I found that changing TF and back again easily fixes that, the thread I found the indi on said refresh the chart but that did not work for me.  
  
Enjoy

If you mean do I ever get stopped out for a loss, Rarely, Look at EJ 25th Nov, 1st trade, I closed for only a 7 pip gain this was a counter trend trade and it looked to me like it was reversing back into trend so I closed it. 2nd trade I re-entered following a 123, I targeted the BRN 137.000 which was short term S&R but Stochs went down to OS so I adjusted my TP back to the congestion area just to the left.  
  
Looking at the 2 charts do you see any reason why I would have taken a loss?  
Another reason is, I do not over trade, look at the charts, I am averaging 1 trade per day, I have plenty of time to make the decision to trade.  
  
It was not always like this, I used to lose loads and then spend twice the amount of time getting it back, the difference now is I "Never" let a winner turn into a "loser", I have been trading the same pairs with the same method for years and I have learnt to pick my targets and leave it alone unless PA tells me otherwise.  
  
Hope it helps

Я смотрю у Вас торговля идет хорошо.  
Только на скринах не вижу индикатора 123, в ручную определяете паттерн?  
Если не сложно - опишите правила для входов: напишу робота, посмотрим что получится.  
******  
I see you have a trade goes well.  
Just do not see on screen display 123, manually define the pattern?  
If not difficult - describe rules for inputs: write robot, see what happens.

The 123 indicators that are available are good for training your eyes to recognize the 123 patterns, but I do not rely on them for trade entry signals.  
  
If you look in the attachment section you will find several PDF files that describe entry and exits rules, TEB63 had a thread about the 123. which I can recommend. <http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=106165>  
  
You could also read "this thread from the beginning", RobDee the thread originator put in a lot of work to explain the method.

ES +30 (7.5 points) Classic Pin Bar entry off Resistance.  
EU ongoing live trade, 123 entry with the News, ADP. SL BE +5, TP is just above the 200%exp at 1.3525, Price has broken thru a rising trend line but has not yet pulled back, but momentum has virtually disappeared. 15 min chart is deeply OS and Hourly is approaching that area, so we will see if this has enough weight to drop down to my TP  
  
UPDATE  
Have moved SL to 1.3550 and taken Half off at 1.3530. Moved TP down to 1.3520

EU +15 +35. Final Tally on that News Trade. Did not reach my final TP, Buyers came back in an pushed price back up and took out my SL at 1.3550. Would also have taken out my SL if I had left it at +5 So, No worries I made profit and that is the main thing. On to the next trade.

Final Tally EU +33 +52. Second TP hit for my news trade. This is what I love about news trading, all over in minutes. First TP 5mins second TP 25mins. A normal days work in 30 mins. I had moved my SL upto 1.3614 which locked in another 24 pips. So No Risk.

EJ +65. Not a 123 entry but useful example of a PA trade. DBL BTM at S&R & BRN with Good Divergence. Also a bounce off the 1hr 200 EMA. Entry at break of descending Trend Line. TP confluence of BRN and S&R level. Lots of good reasons to take this trade.

Dee  
  
I've been following your trades on this thread for the last few weeks. They are amazing! Please keep them coming.  
  
It's always so easy to see, from your charts and reasoning why you chose your entries and your exits. But hindsight is a wonderful thing. In real time, it is a struggle to see so clearly what to do, and I feel, or more importantly, what NOT to do.  
  
For instance, with this last trade, how DID you decide on the price target? In a smaller timescale, say M5, Price reached the local high 139.29 (about middle of your chart) and stalled for almost an hour. What made you decide on the higher target? Did you move your stop loss up to capture some profits in the event price breaks down before reaching your target? The TDI on M5 has come back into the blue line but of course, not yet on the M15 or H1. Which signal do you decide to follow? The M5, M15 or H1? How did you decide to pay attention to one S&R level and not another?  
  
I ask because many times, I think price will more further and it doesn't. And other times, I think price won't move further and it does!

Stop looking at 5 min charts unless you are only planning to scalp for 10 pips! I gave up even looking at 5 min charts some time ago, what you are seeing is noise and misinformation.  
  
I follow the 1hr chart and use the 15min to fine tune my entries. and/or as an early warning system.  
  
I draw my S&R levels off the Daily & 4 hr. 1hr & 15min have minor S&R levels that I want to be aware of because this is where price stalls for a while before carrying on to the HTF S&R levels.  
  
For news trading I trail my stop aggressively. For standard trades it depends on PA but I usually just aim to get to BE + 2-3 pips and give the trade some room to develop, if price stalls for some time I tend to move sl up under the consolidation zone.  
  
Sorry but I do not have a list of rules that I follow, I am a Discretionary trader and follow what PA is doing.

Thank you very much Dee.  
  
I am now going back over your trades and everyone of mine to see if I can spot entries and exits better. It's so obvious now you've said it, because M5 was confusing me and causing knee jerk reactions.  
  
Many thanks again.

Like the thread and system..have downloaded the 123indi(v5 & v6) but all I get are red and blue dots, an occasional blue/red arrow and with v6 red and blue lines. Don't get the 1,2,3 I see on some of the posted charts. Can anyone direct me to the notes or post explaining the finer operations of the indi? Thanks in advance

Trading, as you know, was really crappy this week, so I spent some time working on a project, I am building a Hydrogen Generator to power a car, with out the need for Petrol or Diesel, and I thought I had solved it this time, but after an hour the car started coughing and spluttering. Better than my last attempt. Someone mastered this some years ago, but then he died taking the secret to the grave with him, and I am trying to solve the puzzle, preferably before I die.

Yesterday yielded a couple of decent trades, unlike the rest of the week which was one BE after the other.  
  
EJ +12 +50 2 x 123 trades, Because of the small ranges I trailed SL pretty tight. First trade got stopped for +12, second went the distance.  
EU +50. Pin Bar entry confirmed by a small 123. again ran a tight SL but this went the distance. There was a reverse 123 that formed after but I did not take it.

Thanks for the suggestion, very helpful. I was mystified at first but then I googled "Icelanders+Hydrogen" and lo and behold, they are decades ahead of the rest of us. Unfortunately it will never happen here in Spain, not legally anyway, the Spanish authorities are sh__ scared of anything with the word "GAS" in it. Millions of users in the rest of Europe with LPG but here in Spain, one taxi in Malaga and one in Granada! so what chance hydrogen.

I've been looking for a method I can trade on higher TFs because of a lack of time to trade. I like the 34 Hull MA because I find it works well as dynamic support and resistance by getting the trend direction from the W1 D1 charts and then trading setups on H4 it seems to work well.

OR, you can try, 32, 50, 200 EMAs. OR any other combination of numbers, at some point price will hit those MAs what ever the number that you chose. Some people chose MAs set to FIBO numbers, it really does not matter, What does matter is how many traders are watching a particular MA, take for instance the 200 MA this by all accounts is an important one for the Swing trader and 1,000s of swing traders will make a decision based on this MA.  
  
SMA, EMA, Hull MA, Stevensons Rocket MA or the Dead Cert MA, on the Higher Time frames it does not really matter what the MA is called. Many of the variations of MAs were developed to try to provide an edge on the lower time frames so their sophisticated calculations are more or less irrelevant on the higher time frames.

You can use what ever MA or any other indicator you prefer.  
  
I simply use the 34 Hull MA because I like it, it's my line in the sand, I check to see if price is above or below the 34 HMA on the W1 and D1 charts and then look for 123 patterns on the H4 to enter a trade in line with the higher TFs trend.  
  
It's nothing new, it's not rocket science, I do it because it works for me.  
  
I don't have time to watch the charts all day, trading H4 charts with pending orders means I have time to do other things and not get burned out.

Hi Dee,  
  
I find the 15 HMA to fast the 34 HMA works well with the W1 and D1 charts.

You need to follow the links in post 1 to the other thread where Robdee first introduced the indicator. Try This.

The numerical values were put in manually just to highlite the formation, they are not part of the indi.

Not sure what the market is going to do. See if the professionals are right, no one is right 100% of the time but these guys are pretty damn good.

FOMC will they won´t they? They probably will, but, how the market will react is another thing, if you can get hold of one of these things you will still only have a 50-50 chance of being right!

EU +70. UJ +75. EJ +40  
  
Well, the professionals can be partially wrong!!!!!. This is what fundamentals can do to the Technicals. The Pros got stopped out EU, are still in the UJ and the EJ. So Not Bad really. I did not agree with their long EU so My bias was short EU and Long EJ and Long UJ. But I did not just jump in and hope for the best, I waited for the initial reaction to end and for the market to show it's hand and confirm my bias only then did I enter and pray.

EU +150. Talk about lucky. Out of Boxing day boredom I had a look at the charts last night and saw this triangle setup. Placed 2 limit orders, one long and one short, checked the charts once again before going to bed and lo and behold the long had been filled, moved SL up to BE +2, set TP at the Daily S&R, cancelled the short, and went to bed. Woke up, checked the charts, revised TP to confluence at Weekly S&R, ate a leisurely breakfast with an enormous grin. Whoever initiated this stop run. THANK YOU.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Yesterdays EU +50. Today so far EU SL BE +10 target 50pips. No 123 entries so far, this is why you need to have an alternative method or methods.

Update on today EU +50. Target hit at S&R level, only just. No more today until after FOMC minutes tonite, I was tempted to take the 1hr pin bar off the S&R level but that would have been CT with BRN 1.3600 and the 50 ema not too far above only 7-10 pips, not worth the risk.

Happy new year. Ordinarily I would close any trades at the end of my trading session, but with such small ranges you have to take the pips on offer, if that means leaving the computer on and checking it during the course of the evening, then so be it. The market refuses to adapt to my lifestyle so I have had to compromise.

Yesterday EU +40. I nearly took the Pin Bar CT yesterday but didn´t, the market rewarded my restraint by giving me a 1Hr Pin Bar with trend. My initial TP was down at 1.3525 S&R level, but the market was kind enough to show me, with Divergence, that for now it was not going any lower than 1.3550 so I manually closed for 40pips. If you work with the market it will often be very generous to you, but if you try to fight it, then it can get really nasty!

that's good that you've got away before FOMC meeting .  
so you missed a pin and followed another, the question is which pin will be in your favor.....that's the question ! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

EU +30. That is a real BUGGER, Moved SL down to lock in 30pips because move has lost momentum, slippage took out my SL 2 pips earlier, gave me the 30 at least, that is one of the disadvantages of running tight, you get too close to PA and anything can happen. Se La Vie

EU +40  
did not think you would be interested so did not post, but here it is.  
No such luck today, only managed 40pips on EU. A little more on a couple of others.  
  
No crystal ball today. Did not forsee such low employment numbers so I played it safe and waited until the knees stopped jerking and traders had time to digest all the news, didn't make any difference, no one took any notice of the 0.3% drop in the unemployed. 6.7%  
  
Just for reference. All entries were Pullback entries, waited for the Spike to settle entered on the next candle.

Hmm that colour change EMA is default at 89 if I did not read it wrong. I noticed there appears to be a fair number of viable signals on the 15m when the colour changes with the following supporting conditions :  
  
1)TDI also cross in the same direction with good angle and space  
or  
2)TDI has crossed not too long ago about 1-3 candles.  
or  
3)TDI crossed in the same direction within 1-3 candles 

I want more brain power!

I noticed there appears to be a fair number of viable signals on the 15m when the colour changes with the following supporting conditions : 1)TDI also cross in the same direction with good angle and space or 2)TDI has crossed not too long ago about 1-3 candles. or 3)TDI crossed in the same direction within 1-3 candles

You are not wrong. Except you need to reverse the supporting conditions, the ema supports the TDI. I do not talk about the TDI on this thread, there are a number of threads here on FF or go here

Here you will see the 89 EMA being used in conjunction with the TDI in fact Dginc´s method is IMHO the next best interpretation of the TMS method and is definitely worth a look.

Did not forsee such low employment numbers so I played it safe and waited until the knees stopped jerking and traders had time to digest all the news, didn't make any difference, no one took any notice of the 0.3% drop in the unemployed. 6.7% Just for reference. All entries were Pullback entries, waited for the Spike to settle entered on the next candle. {image}...

Off course I'm interested and I always check on this post to see your trades and learn from them, although I didn't think that you would trade NFP on more than one pair as I thought that the result would be either pro or against dollar so the effect would be the same on all pairs.  
  
traders had a conflict between the low number of Non-Farm Employment Change : 74K and 0.3% drop , it just doesn't make sens and just added another reason for people to trust these numbers or not , which eventually they didn't.  
  
Thanks for sharing and have a nice weekend

No need for the apology, I post none 123 trades every day, so in theory I am constantly "off topic", I just do not discuss other methods because it can take a thread off into the unknown or unwanted. I show my "other trades" simply to highlite the need for more than 1 method.  
  
Incidentally, the TDI Bounce often signals a 123.

Yes and Yes. A mixture of Forex News Gun and Diamond Trading Signals. I usually only trade the EU so I have years of performance data in my head, most news traders trade the UJ for dollar related news, in this instance I realized that such a low print would affect the dollar majors and because I was waiting to see, I had plenty of time to check what previous reactions had been in the UJ and AU.  
  
The EU and I have known each other for years, so we have a tentative agreement that we will give each other the heads up when either of us think that there might be a worth while opportunity, where as the UJ and AU are more cautious of me as we have spent very little time together and they tend to favor their regulars, much like any clique or club, I can understand this. But sometimes, when the out come is glaringly obvious it would be churlish and stupid not to use that information for my own benefit.

Yesterday EU +50 +50. There were a couple of 123 trades indicated but I took these trades because the short tern S&R level was hit and rejected 5 times in total on the 1 hr chart. Divergence formed on the 3rd hit which was also forming a 123, on the 5th hit a small Pin Bar after a reversal bar formed so I took a second entry, both entries had my stop at short term S&R, so risk was minimal. TP was confluence of 200%ext and S&R level and 61.8% Fib ret. I checked chart before bed time and moved SL to BE, then let it get on with it.

That's great Dee, for the past two days the whole ADR for EU was around 50 pips and still you can juice it to the last pip.  
I think 123 is a great tool but EU is narrowing the range and makes it difficult for me to find an entry , finding an alternative is a good thing specially in these ranging days.  
I want to thank you because you directed me once to the TMS thread as they are doing a good work over there, they are not mainly working with 4h, many of them are working on 1h frame and I learned a lot from them.

I just waited and waited and waited for a setup, then lo and behold the EU gave me the heads up that it was going to do something, bit sneaky really because I had to take some heat first as price went back up to test that S&R level again, but eventually the bulls gave in to the bears. I said "Right you bastards, make me sweat would you" and then I put another trade on and said "Take that, see how you like those bananas". I warn you, this is what can happen when you spend too much time on your own in front of a computer screen.

That completes my business for the day. EU +35 News. UJ +35 123 Entry. EJ +30 123 Entry. Because of the small range days I adjusted my TPs to reflect that and concentrated on the nearest S&Rs, short term or long term.

> Yesterday EU +40. I nearly took the Pin Bar CT yesterday but didn´t, the market rewarded my restraint by giving me a 1Hr Pin Bar with trend. My initial TP was down at 1.3525 S&R level, but the market was kind enough to show me, with Divergence, that for now it was not going any lower than 1.3550 so I manually closed for 40pips. If you work with the market it will often be very generous to you, but if you try to fight it, then it can get really nasty! {image}

Checking your posting history reveals that you have already been to the TMS thread and a couple of others that more than cover the Indicators that I use, I have responded to the request for indicators and templates on more than one occasion, search my posts and you will find it.

that's a good day for me.....  
  
EU +17 pip , EJ +27 Pip , and 63 pip for GU for news trading , I didn't trade the news before and had no idea when to enter or to exit , just shoot the button and the price went like a rocket, if I stayed more I would have made more pips but for a newbie like me it's more than great ..![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

Well Done. Hope you are also posting your charts on the TMS thread for feedback.  
Find a method for News trading!! don't just "Shoot the Button" and hope for the best, price often shoots in the opposite direction before reversing into the actual direction, this is where many traders get caught out, make sure you are trading in the direction of the sentiment.  
  
I did not trade today, couldn't be bothered and there was no news to push things either way, apart on GU which I do not bother with these days.

Wanted to thank you for your help and very, very useful postings. Took your recommendation to heart. Went back over your earlier postings. Went back over Phx62 postings in TMS. Zoomed right out and found charts so much easier to read on H4. Plenty of time to make decisions whether to enter, exit or continue. Realise M5 and M15 is too fast for me and too many fake outs.  
  
Got an easy 80-100 pips (scaled out my trades) today. Very happy with stress free result. My final TP was a little further down but as it's Friday, I decided to close my trades early. Missed the boat with the GU news - but I realise I'm not yet ready to trade news. Looking forward to more pips next week.

Thanks Dee , yes I do post in the TMS thread some times, and for the news trading I had many other loosing trades for just shooting the button before , and I know what you mean....![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f923.png?v=15.1) . that's why I'm trying to study news better to see how it could be traded.

UJ +50. Any other type of entry you want. BEEOB. IB. 3 Bar reversal. Divergence at S&R level. Hidden Divergence, and of course a 15min 123 entry, why would you say no?

You are welcome. Glad you have found your method. Do not worry about news trading until you have become consistent with your method, and only then begin to try out an alternative if you still feel you need to.

EJ +40. 123 entry on 1hr and 15min charts. Divergence at S&R supports the decision.

Yesterdays EU +40. 15min 123 Entry. There is so little momentum in the market that I have had to start letting trades continue after my normal trading hours, so this one finally completed during the asian session. TP was the 200% exp of the 123 and S&R level.

You are misunderstanding the concept of a Pin Bar, it was a good TDI cross up, but that was not a valid Pin Bar. Check out the PDF.

Thanks for the clarification Dee , sometimes I see people take the Pinbar alone without divergence , and other times they take the divergence without the Pin bar to make an entry , for sure that combining these two methods together gives a better chance.  
Thanks

A Pin Bar is only a Pin Bar when one of the following occurs and the bar does not form within an area of consolidation  
  
Pin bar + divergence at the tip of the reversal bar  
Pin bar + clear Support or Resistance  
  
Anything other than this is likely to be a Hammer, a Hammer often occurs within consolidation and is a signal that price will reverse back into the initial trend. An example of all three is attached.

EU +107. I had an open swing trade running long, thanks to more market hysteria I have made more pips than I expected. I think these days to be a trader you need to be in contact with an inmate of an asylum because only another lunatic can understand the mentality of the market.!!![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f643.png?v=15.1)\+ ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f643.png?v=15.1) = Pips

It's Ok Dee, you don't have to collect 10,000 pips a month........![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1).  
with this market condition I think who can have a positive balance at the end of the month would be doing more than great.

UJ +30 +70. 123 entry. TP split between 2 significant S&R levels. Larger than average candles made me decide to take partial profit and trail stop to the next S&R level, I was surprised that it actually got there so quickly.

Hi Dee,  
  
I caught this move on GJ: +25, +80, +80. I split my risk into 3 chunks and take partial exits. Helps me calm my nerves a little! 15 pips shy of my target but candles were getting smaller and I had errands to run. Typically, within minutes of my exit, price went to my target.  
  
Quick question: I can see where you get your first S&R but with the second S&R - I can see a S&R around 103.75, a good 20 pips less. The region at 103.52 is not so clear. Was that 2nd target predetermined or partially guided by the candles and momentum on a LTF

2nd target came from Daily. 22-23 05 2013, 103.50 area. Although my S&R lines look like lines in the sand, I actually treat them as areas.  
This is a good example of how 2 traders looking at the same chart see different things, this is how and why the market moves. If we all saw the same thing at the same time there would be no market!  
  
Well done on your trade by the way![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)

Thank you friend!   
Trying to follow your active theme but due to my lack of free time, it sometimes lose how to develop some things in it.   
  
I try to watch at least the graphics you but sometimes I can not understand when you add or remove an indicator and mostly why ....   
  
Am I correct in my next statements about how your trading:   
1\. use PA, Fibonacci, EMA20, 50,100,200 and "TDI"  
2\. TF M15 and H1 only;   
3\. "123 Patterns v6" and the STO now you do not use;   
  
\- Moreover, the Fibonacci which platform you use or any other use Fibonacci?   
  
\- EMA only as support levels you use it or you are important and their intersections?   
  
\- For the "TDI" use these values:   
"Extern int RSI_Period = 13;  
extern int RSI_Price = 0;  
extern int Volatility_Band = 34;  
extern int RSI_Price_Line = 2;  
extern int RSI_Price_Type = 0;  
extern int Trade_Signal_Line = 7;   
extern int Trade_Signal_Type = 0; "   
  
\- Do you trade the "newс" or normally avoid them?   
  
I'll be very grateful if you answer because although probably gave answers back to the topic I could not find them, so I'm trying to digest the situation you just graphics ....

EJ +85 +135. Pin Bar + 123 confirmation.  
UJ +80 +130. Pin Bar + 123 confirmation  
  
2 absolutely identical entry conditions. Perfect Pin Bars at resistance followed by 123 formation confirmation, TP split in 2 using BRN S&R confluence levels.

Wow. What a great move. Missed this one. I saw the pin bar but didn't dare enter as EJ has made previous attempts to go south only to reverse.  
  
You called it a 1-2-3 confirmation. Was the entry and 1-2-3 taken on the M15?

No, the 123 is clearly visible on the 1hr, in fact there are several 123 options visible.  
  
Yes ej was in a range with 1 attempt to go north which was rejected, so the likely hood of going south was much stronger.

Good way to end the week .  
  
I had a -20 pip today on EU, the price was coming down from BRN, TMS H4,H1,15M were crossed down with divergence on 1H, and made a 123 at London open......then two hours later the price decided to go north ! ....Dah

EU +50. 15m 123 entry. This trade I was not confident about, and it was not a very clean signal, so I had a very tight 10 pip stop to start off with, EU had not completed my predicted move to 1.3750 - 1.3740 so I thought I would take a chance and it paid off, my other 2 pairs were in the money so worse case was I could BE, that is acceptable.

I can see 1-2-3 but I thought we're supposed to wait for confirmation i.e. enter at B or C

123 Confirmation, I entered on the Pin Bar. The 123 confirmed the reversal and I was able to breathe again.  
  
Also, look for the TTE ( Traders Trick Entry) in the attachments section.  
  
I agree, normally you would wait for confirmation, if the Pin Bar had not formed I would have entered at B 

Cut your Losers short and let your Winners run.

I agree with you the the divergence were bad since it was in OB, but the price was rejected from yesterday high and BRN ,a bade double top the same time ,and along with bad pinbar that count's as half reason, EU yesterday has made more than 2ATR and there were no news scheduled for today for EU, so in my opinion the context were closer to sell.  
well after all the price has proved by it's direction what is right or wrong right ? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f62d.png?v=15.1)  
but can I ask how did you anticipate that the price should reach 1.3750 ?

I knew someone was going to ask that, unfortunately, that would require a separate thread and I am not even sure if I have got it entirely correct.  
  
It is a method that I picked up from a site called, [Emini Futures, Trading Strategies, Live Emini Trading Room & Trading Videos - Emini Addict](http://eminiaddict.com/)  
  
It is a method that basically follows measured moves. When you first see it being applied you think, WTF???![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f615.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/2753.png?v=15.1) but watching it time and time again, I got the gist of it, then I back tested time and time again and started to understand it. It is something that works very well at predicting where price will go, most of the time, so it is just like every thing else in trading, it works some of the time.

EMINIADDICT  
  
Sorry, I forgot to mention that most of the site is subscriber only access, but he does have one video every day that is open to the public, here is a link to todays video. You need to have patience because he reviews the the futures indexes first and then moves on to the futures currencies, the the currencies are  
6E = EU  
6B = GU  
6C = UC  
6J = UJ (JU) in futures trading it is the yen/dollar  
6A = AU  
  
<http://eminiaddict.com/?p=7787>  
  
I generally download the video so that I can go back thru it in my own time and I can skip the indexes and move to the currencies which are normally about half way thru.

No. You trade with the stop loss you can afford and you place that stop loss at the time of your entry, it is called a "stop loss" for a reason. PHx62 and Eeelfranz used an emergency stop loss of 50 pips, that is what they could afford, others place stop at the last swing high or low, even if that is 70 pips it all depends on your money management, but one thing is certain, what ever your stop loss, it is put in place as soon after your entry as possible. A few tears are preferable to opening a vein.  
  
Have a good weekend.

1\. use PA, Fibonacci, EMA20, 50,100,200 and "TDI" Yes.  
  
2\. TF M15 and H1 only; Trading TF 1Hr, 15min to fine tune entries Daily and 4hr for S&R levels.  
  
3\. "123 Patterns v6" and the STO now you do not use; I no longer use the V6 indi I do not need it to identify 123s, I still use the stochastic on my TDI method.  
  
Moreover, the Fibonacci which platform you use or any other use Fibonacci? I do not understand this question  
  
  
EMA only as support levels you use it or you are important and their intersections? 200 & 50 Ema support levels. 20,50 & 100 ema are my variation of the TEB63 method. This links to TEB63.  [http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=7133778#post7133778](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=7133778#post7133778)  
  
For the "TDI" use these values. I use the default TDI settings  
  
Do you trade the "newс" or normally avoid them? I trade the news and there are recent postings showing this!!

Thank you very much for the answer !  
Will review the topic "1.2.3. Break batsis ."  
  
# Regarding the indicator "123 V6 " I understand that you no longer use it because you recognize yourself 123 configuration ?  
  
# For " TDI " I asked because I have three options drawn from different places :  
1\. Traders Dynamic Index.mq4 <http://dox.bg/files/dw?a=e432d4c7c2>  
2\. Traders_Dynamic_Index-mod_TC_01.mq4 <http://dox.bg/files/dw?a=6d9f314fb8>  
3\. TDI-With Alerts.mq4 <http://dox.bg/files/dw?a=18cf3f93e8>  
so that's why I ask you what are your settings for it to see who is the " original " ?  
  
# On Fibonacci - I have several indicators that build it on the chart but I want to know what you use - that which is in itself a platform / draw it manually / or use any indicator ?  
  
# Trading on a " news " - I guess that as the economic calendar to some extent picking currency pair or seen where there is room for good movement without the following very very foundation ?  
  
# I do not see trading or at least do not see graphs of gold or oil?  
  
Oh .... will stop it again I bombarded with countless questions ....  
  
Thank you again!

123 V6. I have not needed an indicator to identify 123s for some time, I had it on my charts for the benefit of others to show how to use it.  
  
All the indicator I use can be found in the attachments section!! I have done several posts covering this.  
[http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...76#post6731476](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=6731476#post6731476)  
  
TDI. I have always used this one because it does not repaint.  
[http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...mentid=1207482](http://www.forexfactory.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=1207482)

[http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...mentid=1207470](http://www.forexfactory.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=1207470)  
  
Fibs. I use the Fib retracement and Fib expansions tools that come with Metatrader.  
  
News. [http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...04#post7205604](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=7205604#post7205604)  
  
Gold or Oil. I do not trade either, because on a Day Trading basis both are extremely volatile, and require much larger stop losses to trade effectively, both of them "whipsaw" like crazy. For many years I only traded the eurodollar, it has only been recently that I added a few other pairs due to the small trading range that the EU has been experiencing.

EU News. +20 UJ News. +30. Can not expect too many pips from core durable goods, so you have to adjust your expectations according to the impact level of each annoucement. Not every bit of news runs for 50 or 60 pips. There were 123 entries on the EU and UJ but the entry point coincided with the news so I waited.

EJ +30 +117. 123 Entry. Split TP and trailed stop behind last candle, who would have known?  
  
This is a strange game, 2 identical entries at practically the same time following the same pattern down. neither of which I expected to go as far as they have, do not get me wrong I am not complaining, but trying to figure this market out![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f633.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f937-200d-2642-fe0f.png?v=15.1)

Nice work Dee....![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) , it seems that no one can no how deep the rabbit whole could go, right ?  
  
I really find it difficult to be in the right time at the right place , do you use more than one monitor or more than once workstation at the same time to see where a chance could pop up and jump just right in time ?

I have never used V2 so no comment. But there must have been a reason why RobDee updated the indicator each time.  
  
Can you post a screenshot, because I do not understand your last question

I only use 1 monitor and the reason I have 2 workstations is that my wife uses one for her work, when she needs more processing power we swap.  
  
If you do not see an opportunity on 1 monitor, having multiple monitors does not make it any clearer, I actually used to run with 2 large monitors but I found it distracting, I never had the urge to be a pilot so multiple information points was too much for me. Multiple monitors are useful if you want to watch more than 4 pairs, although I could never figure out why someone would need to.

Well done.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1) You have got 25 pips more than me today! I have dithered, I procrastinated so much that I have missed every opportunity today. It was so bad that I shut down and went and cut some firewood for a few hours.  
  
Lesson. If you are not in the right frame of mind, no matter what level of experience, do not trade. Go and do something else.

Оk thanks  
That these settings I mean because I remember them from memory but they were M5 as I understand it.  
  
Regarding my problem - I can not show graphics because it is that example is the closing of one or two candles and only then my arrow appears but it is behind schedule?!

Hah....I'm in that state most of the time![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61e.png?v=15.1)....and no woods for me to cut but seems today was an exception, I was under the impression that this is only happening to me because I'm a newbie , it's good to know that even experienced traders could have some , it looks to me a better way to look to things , just like what you said before , that if you are not seeing a chance presenting itself then just simply walk away from it.  
Thanks for the advice.

I could not find the indi from the indicator list after I put in the indicator folder.  
  
Also after the newest upgrade of MT4, when I used the default setting with 123patternsV6, the system is very slow until I change the zigzag depth to 4 and above.  
  
Thanks.

Hi Dee,  
  
EU was in prison for the past few days and today was just released.......![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f911.png?v=15.1)  
  
You may noticed that Meta trader is automatically updated on any restart for build 600 , I noticed that the platform gets stuck and freeze for many times, I started to debug and see what could get wrong, at last I found that whenever the platform starts it tries to load the 123 indicator, during that loading it hangs for a while and for some reason it's related to Zigzag depth that is used with 123 indicator , after many tries and a lot of working around I ended up removing the 123 indicator and everything worked smoothly with the new update, I already recognize the 123 pattern visually and it's not a big deal to use the indicator for.  
I just wanted to share this with you as I know that you may face the problem.  
waiting to see you after the NFP tomorrow....Good luck

Hello ,  
I was loving the 123 indicator v6 and was using it with success.  
MT4 just did a new update on 02/09 and now I can't get it to even show up much less work.  
I tried reinstalling it and also the other versions, v5 and v7 but they are not working.  
Anybody have any idea what is going on?  
Thanks in advance for any help you can give with this.

I see that the indicator is in the correct indicator folder in the downloads folder but when I open my chart, it is not in the custom indicator column.  
Driving me crazy and have been trying to figure this out for 2 plus hours now...  
Anybody that can help, I would sure appreciate it...

Ok so it is in the folder as Faze instructed but when I try to put it on the chart, mt4 becomes "unresponsive" and I have to shut it down.  
Is anyone else having this problem after this new mt4 upgrade.  
If you are not having this problem with reloading the indicator after the upgrade, what are you doing that I'm not?  
Thanks

The problem with v7 is that it doesn't mark 123s.  
But thank you sincerely for the effort.  
If anyone figures this out, please post as there seem to be quite a few here who use this indicator.

I seem to remember for one of them (not sure if it was V7) that you had to have the zigzag indi in indicator file.

I think that was for the v 6.  
I remember them saying that v7 doesn't use zigzag....

EU +17 +38. Yellen News Trade. I have been off with flu so I have not traded for the last week. I decided to ease back into things and trade Yellen. it was unlikely that she was going to countermand any thing that Bernanke had set in motion so I was expecting price to go down. The difficulty was judging by how much so the easiest way was by picking out recent S&R levels and taking profits at each one.  
  
I have included a 5min chart to show how I entered. I waited for the Pullback after the initial spike down, this pulled back to a short term S&R level which was also the 61.8% retracement of the initial spike, the theory was that if price closed above the 61.8% then I would be looking for a long. Just to be safe my SL went just above my entry at only 5 pips so I was not going to go crying back to my bed if I had it all wrong.  
  
I see you have all been having fun with the new release of MT4. Sorry I can not help with that but I do not run the auto update so I am still on build 509.

EU +14 +28. 123 Entry on 5 min. There was a smaller 123 earlier but I wanted to see more upward movement as I was on the 5min chart which ordinarily I would not be. My initial tp was lower but the large candle in the middle of the move convinced me to try for higher.

Thanks Dee for showing this trade and the reasons behind entering especially the 5M chart, fascinating!

EU +26 +58. Multiple signals confirming a down move. Pin Bar on the daily. 123 on the 4 Hr & 1hr. Held at the 50% Retracement. Rejected at BRN & S&R level. MBL on the TDI was sloping down. Price & Signal line below the 50%. Stochastics not completing the upward cycle. Every thing was politely indicating that the EU was going down so I briefly considered going long, just to be different, but as I do not print money, I decided to go short. The rest was down to yet another politician/ bureaucrat manipulating the market. Thank you, now I do not have to wait for Draghi this evening.

EU +40. Straight forward 123 entry. There were actually a couple of earlier 123 entries but I was asleep. The chart explains everything. I always like to see my entries backed up by confluence, in this instance BPCs, Breakout Pullback to short term S&R level.

Found this on another site and I hope it helps with the indicators here.  
  
  
As a result of the recent MetaTrader 4 (MT4) Build 600 upgrade, and subsequent versions, the folders for saving EAs have been moved.  
  
To identify your MT4 build click **Help > About** on your client terminal  
  
[https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/pr...014_075902.png](https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/t_WimFM6K7OkETIDItBTjQ3uTCnE6byFU2FUIUOZ6EWJhzSaCdB8ksr8dkNLVqPNl-wIoEYAX1ZbywnNg0tWpLBdTM7zZwGj7YYhKTTDP-5jI51pTZ4j7pauT7WABGyrjLTLlPhnpe4FSULJ=s0-d-e1-ft#https://gallery.mailchimp.com/763d184dfb1331ef73f6a8568/images/IMG_13022014_075902.png)  
  
Since this upgrade EAs, Indicators, Scripts and Library files are now to be saved in different locations.  
  
You can access this folder from your MT4 client terminal by clicking on **File > Open Data Folder.**  
  
All indicators should be saved in the folder titled: **MQL4 > Experts**.  
  
All indicators should be saved in the folder titled: **MQL4 > Indicators**.  
  
All library files should be saved in the folder titled: **MQL4 > Libraries**.  
  
All script files should be saved in the folder titled: **MQL4 > Scripts**.  
  
Clients using an earlier MT4 build, please note that once you upgrade to the new version your EAs, Indicators, Scripts and Library files will be **_transferred automatically_** to the folders mentioned above. Please ensure that this is effective once you upgrade and that your EAs and/or indicators are working correctly.  
  
Finally, the MQL4 language has also been modified in this latest build, and this may interfere with your installed Expert Advisors (EAs) and indicators. If you notice any issues with your pre-installed EAs or indicators we encourage you to take the below actions.  
**Action 1:** Contact your EA provider if you do not have the source code available and request an updated version of the EA, or ensure that the current one can properly run under the new MT4 build.  
**Action 2:** If you have written your own EAs or have the source code available, please follow these steps:

  1. Navigate to**Tools** > **MetaQuotes Language Editor** – a new window will appear.

  1. Navigate to**View** > **Navigator** – the Navigator box will appear in this window (if not shown already).

  1. Double-click on the EA/indicator you would like to use and update – the relevant EA script will appear in the main window.

  1. Alternatively navigate to**File > Open** to locate the relevant EA/indicator source code saved on your computer.

  1. Click on **Compile** in the toolbar on top of the main window (or navigate to **File > Compile**) – a message will appear in the Toolbox window at the bottom.

  1. Once this has completed and there are no error messages displayed you will need to close and reopen your MT4 client – your EAs and indicators should now be ready to use

  1. If errors or warnings are displayed please review your code again or consult an MQL4 expert.

  1. If it is an EA you are using, it may be good to back test it again, and/or run it on a demo environment for a while prior to using it live.

  
**FinFX wants to inform our clients that we do not upgrade to latest version of MT4 until it has been fully tested on by our development team and with our technology providers.**  
  
**Build 509 will be usable as long as MetaQuotes keeps the build available for login.** Currently the oldest supported version is build 500 and according to MetaQuotes this should not change meaning that even after we have upgraded our server to the latest build, clients can still use the old build 509.  
  
Feel free to contact our **Customer Support** team via live chat or email [[color=#0066cc]info@finfx.fi[/color]](mailto:info@finfx.fi) for further assistance.

Thought this might be of interest to those of you who are trying to Trade the news. This comes from a veteran of 15 years who trades 200 - 300 contracts per day!!!! It is a long video mainly because he rambles so much, but stick with it because amongst it all is some very useful information.

Although it is a Youtube video it was originally a webinar done for one of the Ninjatrader Forums who have regular webinars for their members

EU +30. Very scrappy 123 TTE entry. not the cleanest entry, but before I lost the will to live I realized that only a long would work and the TP was the BRN with 200% Exp as confirmation. I was tempted to close before the news, but it was the only thing likely to create some movement so I moved my stop upto the short term S&R which gave me a B/E +2 pips and let it run to TP.

EJ +38. Straight forward clean 123 Entry, signalled on 1hr and 15min chart. TP was obvious, so much confluence price was always going to bounce. BRN, S&R, 50% & 61.8% Fib Ret, 200% Exp. I did not bother with my other pairs, the range is so small that although direction is obvious, the oil leak on my car drips faster and further than current PA. News is minor so unlikely to have much effect, even FOMC this evening is going to be a none event.

EU +20 +48 +17. Double Top with Div off an S&R level, waited for confirmation from the TDI and Stochs, did not think this was going far was going to take just 20 but momentum increased so took 1 off at 20 and moved target down to next S&R level. A pullback to the short term S&R gave me the opportunity to load another up with a very tight stop just behind the S&R level.

Good Job Dee, I understood once from you that you don't consider TDI divergence if it was over 68 or under 23, but as long it's a winning trade then it's great.

You are absolutely correct, but, in this instance the stochs shows 2 divergences during the same period of the TDI divergence, and they formed below the 80 line confirming downward momentum. and the real trigger here was the double top at S&R and the failure of PA to break higher, so if one signal was not entirely accurate there were others that confirmed. 

Cut your Losers short and let your Winners run.

Almost Identical to yesterday. EU +18 +35 short. EU +20 Long. First trade is obvious, everything marked on the chart. 2nd trade was a gamble based on Hidden divergence with bounce off a short term TL, S&R & OS condition on TDI & Stochs, it was going back up but how far?. Closed 2nd trade manually as PA has stalled at BRN, same as yesterday.

Good trade, well executed. See how the 123 coincides with a TDI bounce.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)

EU +20 +50. EJ +28 +70. What a great day thanks to New Home sales. If I was prepared to spread myself thin there were also trades on the UJ and AU. The trades were so obvious, no long explanations required. The charts say it all. Descending Trend Lines, Pin Bars with LTF 123s these really were no brainers. TPs were obvious as wel except EU has dropped further than I thought it would, but, main thing is I have banked a few pips.

Have a look at the previous 2 pages of this thread, other people had problems, if that does not help you there is a thread here on FF about v600 metatrader, 100s of traders have had problems with their indicators because of the upgrade to v600.  
  
I would suggest that you give a bit more information about your problem, "indicator not working" is a bit vague.

Another good trade Dee ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1), I really find it hard to be at the right place and time, sometimes I stay all day long and cannot find a setup and other times I get bored and I get distracted with anything like Facebook or playing with my kids or whatever and when I get back to the charts I see how I missed a nice looking setups.  
trading is a lonely business and needs a special sort of discipline that is not not easy to get a long with.

EU +43 +85. EJ +100. Thanks to a complete over reaction to insipid news. I am sorry but I fail to see how this reaction is indicative of "Professional Traders", the people we are suppose to fear, they trade like a bunch of kindergarten kids, scrambling from one titbit to another, no wonder the big financial institutions admitted that they did not make a profit from their Forex divisions!!.

EU +32 Pip, that was my initial TP, I didn't think that the price would go up that far and when I saw the price going like a rocket I tried to modify my TP but it refused to change and by that time target was hit.

Thanks for your comment. It's really quite reassuring to me as I often can't make sense of why the market reacts or does not react to news.  
  
Today though I managed to catch 80pips of the EJ move. Could have pushed it to 100 pips but had an errand to run. Can't do EU or UJ yet. Concentrating on just one pair for now.  
  
Please keep posting your trades and comments. They are very, very helpful.

ej M15 , 123 buy entry from yesterday, few minutes after news release.  
Note, TDI was coming out of OS below32, also previous week low acted as support.  
I had to go out, closed first part for +17 , second for 35 pips

Today NY session gj H1.  
I entered at the break of 123, closed first portion at next res. for 35pips,  
and was holding second for 161 fib ext. , it didn't make it there for now and exited at same level for 35pips as well.  
I wanted to enter one candle earlier, but wasn't sure if price would break the upper trendline.

Yesterdays Trades. EU +25 +15. EU +20 +45. Can money be made in a crappy market? Only if there is a clear sign of where the market wants to go, and, if the Gods are with you. Multiple 123s but I did not like them on their own as the pullback to 3 was too deep each time, but a nice steep trend line formed and was clearly holding price so this dictated entries, backed up by the HTF TDI & Stochs clearly showing downward momentum. trendline gave me nice tight stops, just in case. First Trade went to first TP but was stopped on the second part on the trailing stop. second trade ran the distance, but went far over my usual trading time.  
Every thing is marked on the chart.

There was no real divergence to support the Pin Bar, a Pin Bar on it's own is no reason to enter it "must" have something to prove it, remember a Pin bar can also be a Hammer a continuation bar, also, the 4Hr TF was still in a 123 short pattern. I was not convinced so I watched and if the next 15 min bar had been green and closed above the TL I would have looked for an entry long, but the bar was a small red Doji showing indecision so my bias at that time was still short. The next bar was a small green Pin Bar that closed below the TL this prompted me to go short again.

EU +15. As luck would have it, here is an example of the 1hr Pin Bar I scalped it for 15 pips. Notice it is backed up by all sorts of divergences, Hidden Divergence on the 1 hr chart and Regular Divergences on the 15 min.

Yesterday EU +26. Overnight +60 +71. Today News +105. Not a 123 in sight, but here are some numbers any way, you really need to have more than one method in your tool box. Over the last few days Trend lines have been in play.

Dbl Bottom off Trend Line, did not reach my initial TP so, as my stop was at BE I let them run, not something I normally do.

UJ +50 News. EJ +70 123 Entry + news. EU + 38 News. No real legs to NFP today. I was in a 123 on the EJ, I left it running even though I was not at BE, risky but it paid off.

AU +60 4 Hr 123 early Channel Entry. I am trying out the SHI channel after Phx62 started using channels on the TMS thread. I know there are are other methods of drawing the channels but I found them to be too subjective or just plain inaccurate. The SHI channel is known for repainting and is no use for back testing, I tested using a trading simulator and the results were pretty good

2 trades for me today. It's March break here, so we enjoy spending time with the kids and last days of skiing.  
GJ , H1 123 early entry after break out and pullback to channel. entry on M15. +55  
  
EJ H1 break out and pullback to triangle, TDI red and green below MBL and level 50. M15 entry +45.  
EXIT both due to late in NY session, low volume.

I took an overnight asia session trade on ej H1 as a continuation of yesterdays trend,  
set my TP at H1 200ema, price didn't make it there, exited for +30 pips. It would've made a standard 50pips tp though.  
  
Second trade was a CT scalp trade on gj M5 in NY, 123 entry , along with divergence and confluence bounce off  
H4 200ema, 61.8 fib ret. and lower channel line. partial exits +30, +20  
Had the rest of the day off ..

EJ +58. Pin Bar. UJ +30 Pin Bar. EU +5 123. 2 x 1hr Pin Bar entries and a 15 min 123 which was a mistake that I was lucky to get out of. EJ is in a bit of a range and that dictated my TP. UJ is in a long term uptrend but a short term downtrend?????![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f615.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/2753.png?v=15.1) so I picked an S&R level and aimed for that. I did the EU because it was a 123 CT which was plain stupid, thought I was being really clever, outwitting the market. My excuse is, yesterday I spent the whole day dealing with Spanish stupidity, sorry I meant Bureaucracy, and with that much exposure I became contaminated and that affected my decision making processes today.  
  
Have you ever watched your toenails grow? it is fascinating. It is actually more entertaining than watching paint dry.  
  
In the last 5 days the market has moved a whopping 100 pips I was getting so excited I needed 2 Prozacs and a large joint the effects of which at my age proved to be quite interesting.

Hi IMI, nice to see you over here in the hinterlands. Thank you for posting your charts it is great to see another perspective on the method and to see other pairs being traded.  
  
I have traded the EU exclusively for so long that when I decided to add another 3 pairs, I broke out in a cold sweat and had to lie down for a few days to recover, so to see other pairs being traded and conquered is great.

Dee, you're too funny![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f923.png?v=15.1)  
thanks for giving me a good laugh.....  
on the other hand if you had hold your CT for another 2 hrs you could've made 10pips more...lol  
  
I've been busy with all March break activities...got on gj H4 , twice, but couldn't monitor so set BE level to 25pips,  
both hit BE. The setup was good, with hidden bullish divergence, at lower channel line, 61.8fib ret., tdi cross etc..  
looks like it's breaking out of the channel now...

Can anyone help this young man. I have not upgraded to v600 so I do not have any INDIs that have been converted. Could some kind soul post a version of 123patternsv6 that works with the new version of MT4. Unfortunately as I am not the thread originator I can not edit the first page to include any modifications to the indicator or method. Perhaps we should start a new thread, that way we could put every thing on the first page where it can easily be found by any new Trading Nomads.  
  
What would would we call the new thread? My trading style encompasses 2 or 3 methods and I see that many who come here also have at least one other method in their tool box, which IMHO is crucial.

EU +54. 15m 123 Entry, confirmed by 1hr 123. Price came back and kissed my SL but I had Garlic last night so it must have put price off and it left my SL in place. Consumer sentiment gave me a quick win, TP should have been up at the top of the channel, but I have to go out and strim some weeds. Look at the chart, every thing favoured a long, the only thing that would have made it go short was divine intervention or maybe JP Morgan.

same here, +57 on ej. The idea was that the H4 lower channel line was reached along with still showing a hidden bullish divergence.  
H1 and M15 also had divergence. I entered on m5 123, price started moving very quickly and I changed my tp level to 100 pips, to 140.63 which was a level  
to the left, I was up +82 pips , but guess what , the good old H4 10ema capped the move at 140.50 RN. still it was a quick nice move, which I like  
Many people don't like divergences, I don't know why, for me they work great combined with PA and other supporting factors.

I took the same trade as your entry and ran off with 15 pips, when i see the chart my fingers get itchy, I wish I can develop the right patient to let profits run.  
have a nice week end Dee...Cheers.

Hi Sayed,  
  
the indicators as far for this thread are the same, the problem is with the new update for MT4 600 built, try to attach the indicator and change the value for the ZigZag to 5, it worked for me but could have some differences in different time frames, that's why I dropped the indicator and trained my eye to see it,it's not difficult if you focused for a bit.

I found the show123 indi in one of your posts, while browsing through the thread, spending TWO whole days going  
through posts and attachments.  
here it is , it works fine, everything works fine for me on the new build 600.  
from your MT4 platform open FILE- OPEN DATA FOLDER-MQL4-INDICATORS. that's where you need to put indis.  
I put it on my chart just to see how it shows 123 formation, but it's better to train your eyes to spot them on your own rather then rely on indi signals.

EU +45 123 Entry. 15m & 1hr. A 123 formed on the EJ but price had already travelled 70 pips and the TDI and Stochs did not look convincing. As it happens, a TTE entry would have yielded 40 ish pips. surprise surprise.

Sayed,  
  
We are all the same here , we are not the owner of this thread nor the indicator itself, all what I could find is that after attaching the indicator I changed the value for ZigZag to 5 and it worked fine with 600 Built, however I advice you try to locate the 123 pattern by yourself , it's not that hard to find.  
Good Luck

EJ +50. 123 Entry. Not the ideal 123, the 2-3 leg pulled back much deeper than I ordinarily prefer, but the double bounce off the bottom trend line of the 4 Hr Channel justified the risk, also the entry candle engulfed the previous 3 candles. TP had to be in the area of the descending Trend Line and the 200% Fib exp.

EU +20 Pip, I saw your trade and it inspired me , I took it form the same reasons that you did and almost wanted to close the trade at loss, then things started to change and I was more than happy with 20 Pips !

One of the Masters of Price Action Trading. Al Brooks. Not a natural teacher, but then how many of us are? As the market is quiet check out this video on Trading Channels & Price Action Trading, in the first part he deals with Channels how to draw them, how to trade them etc, second part he shows you how he does a Bar By Bar analysis on a 5 min chart, fascinating and extremely relevant in any time frame. The video is 2.13 hrs long but it is only the first 1.5 hrs that matter.  
  
This is the link to the youtube page. [http://www.youtube.com/results?searc...0channels&sm=1](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=al%20brooks%20trading%20channels&sm=1)  
  
I actually download the videos so that I can watch them on my TV, multiple times, without using up all the bandwidth.  
  
This is the video on Trading Channels. Enjoy

GU +48. 123 Entry. The only pair with news during my trading time. 123 on 15m. 1hr channel is virtually flat, 4 hr channel is really wide at 480 pips, indicating that lower time frames dictate trend at the moment. The wider the channel, the less directional momentum.

FOMC EU +80. UJ +80. Today EU +30. Bear Flag continuation of last nights FOMC with 123 on 5m and 123 confirmation 10 mins later on 15m. Last night's FOMC was a no brainer. They were hardly going to announce no more tapering so Dollar positive it was. I closed manually on the FOMC, I had expected more of a move, but I suppose that the continuation of tapering was not really news and was already priced in by many.

nice trade Dee, don't you think that trading the FOMC is a little bit risky ? I mean I saw many cases for FOMC that the price would just wobble up and down hitting buyers and sellers at the same time , do you trade little amount at that time or it's pure news trading ?

You have to judge sentiment and how the market has been prior to the announcement, in this instance the market had been in consolidation with little or no direction, sentiment was that tapering would continue, foregone conclusion really, so even just confirmation of this was likely to move the market in favour of the Dollar add to this the projected rate announcement and the direction was guaranteed, all that was left was to work out by how much.  
I can not understand why so many experienced traders advise not trading the news, probably because they have not learnt "how" to trade the news, in reality it is no different than ordinary trading it requires exactly the same skill set and preparation, I actually find it much easier to do. For some years I traded nothing but the news, it was great, get up late have a leisurely breakfast do a few odd jobs go to the bar have a Cafe Americano and a Bocadillo con Pechuga de Pollo discuss the weather with some of the old fellas, return to my office at 14.15pm ready for the announcement at 14.30pm, by 15.30 I was done with 50 - 100 pips in the bank. When the bar installed WIFI I would take my laptop there and trade from the bar, the view over the valley is much nicer from there.

Good to know that you are trading the news while relaxed, I bet that this didn't came by chance, I know people got a stroke or even got part of their stomach removed before they decided to quit trading the news.  
I see the problem with how each trader could interpretate the news or decide the sentiment , each trader has his own understanding and tools , with the fact that in many cases the market would react exactly the opposite direction to what the news really came out, add to this the herds reaction when someone falls you start to see the whole domino follow that fall.  
someday I will be trading off the beach relaxing like you do and hopefully we can have a drink together.  
Cheers

EJ +22 +72. Good start to the week. This unfolded nicely. see how it started with a 123, off HTF trend line and HTF divergence, on a 5m chart with an exhaustion spike on the TDI, then became a 123 on the 5 & 15m charts then became a Pin bar on the 1hr and then the 4hr chart, all confirming that this CT trade was a runner. Of course at the start you can not know so a tight stop and an early TP at the first BRN, then move stop down to the second 123 locking in 20 pips and letting it run down to the next BRN, trailing sl on the 5m chart just waiting for that turn around back into trend. now I can shut down and enjoy the rest of the day.

Nice trades Dee, thank you for sharing them.  
I haven't been around much lately, simple because trading is hard to do from my timezone  
living at EST. Trying to get on a trade in asia session early, then find it at BE coz I can't monitor it, or catching   
the endtail of the market in US session just depresses me. Trying to find solution is not easy ...  
  
anyway I am sharing my lucky trade from last night's asia session eu/aud H1 bounce off previous week low for third time , with tdi   
crossing above mbl + 123, and H4 pin pullback. China news moved price to my set +50 pips target to the pip. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
second trade is in today's NY session, gj H1 123 hanging on 200ema and previous day high, entry on M15 H@S trendline break. slow volume,closed for +30

EU +55. Easy 123 Entry, no brainer Dbl Bounce of Btm of 4hr Channel into 123 on 1hr and 15m. TP obvious.  
Never be dismayed if you do not get all of a move, be happy that it reached "your" TP, eventually with more experience you will find you are able to identify the target zones much more accurately, Trading is not an exact science, actually it is less exact than "Pin the tail on the donkey"

> Nice trades Dee, thank you for sharing them. I haven't been around much lately, simple because trading is hard to do from my timezone living at EST. Trying to get on a trade in asia session early, then find it at BE coz I can't monitor it, or catching the endtail of the market in US session just depresses me. Trying to find solution is not easy ... anyway I am sharing my lucky trade from last night's asia session eu/aud H1 bounce off previous week low for third time , with tdi crossing above mbl + 123, and H4 pin pullback. China news moved price...

Nice trades. 80 pips is not a bad living. I like your charts but only to look at, if my charts were that naked my sex life would really suffer i would end up having to take Viagra as well as the prozac. The extra lines and squiggles on my charts are like a comfort blanket to me.  
  
can not really help you with your time zone problem, ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f937-200d-2642-fe0f.png?v=15.1) has any one suggested trading the Daily TF?![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)

nice, again...  
I like when 123s happen in just a few candles , that show momentum.  
strange time for the eu to move 70 pips.  
I guess my tp wasn't obvious, lol, quickly came back to BE. gu h1 daily trendline bounce, and previous week low

EU +35. EJ +13. Couple of really crappy trades today. 123 on eu to start and then just died moved my tp up to collect 35pips, I was dubious because the 1 - 2 leg was quite long and the daily range was 60 - 70 pips. EJ was a complete waste of time. Started with a nice pin bar but then went nowhere, I closed it for 13 pips, I was not prepared to nursemaid these trades, life is too short, and the sun is shining.

EJ +50 +95. EU +23 +34. 123 entries off good S&R levels etc. Every thing is on the charts. UJ looks good now but the earlier situation did not show a clean setup so I left it alone. EU I closed final TP manually as it missed my TP by 2 pips and this was a CT trade so no point in hanging on hoping. EJ was a good strong signal with multiple confirmations, news from china helped things along.

I was watching the EJ and because it was trending down for the past three days I didn't imagine that it will bounce this much, specially when it will be a counter trade, sometimes I feel that every trader has to have a gambling spirit before taking any trade, or build experience and confidence based on what he loses in this market.  
Nice Trades Dee

"Trending down for three days" but what was the longer term trend and what were the clues. Look at the Daily and 4 Hr chart. Pull back to the 50% Retr on Daily. No rising trend lines broken. False breakout forming a 4 Hr Pin Bar off BRN support & TL2. PA within 2 Triangles a larger (TL1 & TL2), and inside that, a smaller(TL1 & TL3). The arguments for an up day were pretty convincing. We all see things differently, Thank the gods, if we didn,t there would be no market.  
  
Gambling Spirit. You are right. Every trade is a gamble. We all have a 50 - 50 chance, all we can do is try to improve our chances thru interpretation.

EJ has an up trend on the daily but took the whole month of Feb as a correction going down for more than 800 Pips, 4Hr charts are subjective to server time as mine ( +3GMT ) shows no Pinbar and shows only an engulfing candle, I agree with you that after that 4H closes it's a good chance to buy and that's why there were more momentum on the second 4Hr candle, but before that time I guess it's more like a stop hunt.  
I'm not sure where I read a signature for someone that says " well traders need no luck , well traders are well prepared " , and it's clear for me that I still need a lot to prepare my self for, anyway. Thanks Dee.

EJ +18 +60. Was this a really clever trade? No! There was a weak 123 off a small rising trendline, nothing said "this is about to turn and drop" there was no high impact news which was likely to turn things around. So I controlled risk by taking early profit and moving SL to B/E, after that I left it alone. 6 hrs later it hit my final tp at the top of the channel

The difference between brokers data is astounding, I took the same trade but the info displayed on my chart showed a much stronger divergence. This is why I prefer my futures platform, we are at least all on the same playing field.

EJ +24 +50. EJ News +30. 123 off good divergence at a BRN and S&R level. TP1 was next BRN TP2 was 50pips which ran into the news. News trade was a simple 30 at the same TP as TP2.

geomoon's trade is shown on H1, yours is on M15 which had a steeper divergence.

Hey Dee....... I remember that you said that Draghi is always good as 50 Pips, were you able to grap some... ? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
I have a problem called " Patience ", I tried today to trade Draghi like any news and had several tries and they were in the right direction , but for stupidity and being impatient I ended up in negative pips, how did you overcome the Patience while you in the trade ? is it something meditating or a big beer draft can fix ?![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f937-200d-2642-fe0f.png?v=15.1)

Draghi news Trades. EJ +48. EU +28 +32 and still running. I entered 5 lots on EU and 1 on EJ, in hindsight I should have done it the other way round but no problem I have banked pips and I am at B/E +10, +4 & +2 so I can let them run. 1st chart. EJ. 2nd chart EU chart, 3rd chart Eu current situation. I did not trade the initial rate announcement I waited for the News Conference

Couple of news trades for me today.  
I waited for NFP to pass and entered on continuation of the news movement  
Both ej and gj showed divergences on M15 as well.

EJ +60 News NFP. One of those reports that you should stay out of until the chickens realise that the fox is on the other side of the fence. UP Down Up Down I was beginning to feel sea sick, when the result misses the consensus figure by very little, sit back and wait, eventually when the pro traders have all finished phoning each other and asking "what does it mean, oh!

I've been trading these news setups with success, have to stay out of the initial release, there is almost always  
a pullback on the same H1 candle, then I just join in for the continuation as where the initial release taken the price  
just as it can be seen on your uj H1 chart  
For the ej trade I entered at the exact same price you did on M15.  
Too bad I had to cut my trades short today and go to get my hair done![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1),  
gj went down 100 pips to previous support (left) where I expected it all along.  
Note on the H1 chart the cross I highlighted where both TDI green and red cross MBL at the 68 level,  
that's one of my favorite tdi setups and can produce big pips and a move back down to 32 level.  
I like news days , it can move your trade relatively fast to your tp levels, like it did today for gj.

Nice Trades Dee, I just have one question , I always try to learn from your style where do you place your stops and take profit, for the EU trade I see that the trade has the opposite directions from stop loss and take profit, is that right ?

Hi, sorry I have taken so long to respond. I generally place my SL a couple of pips below/above the 3 point unless the pullback to 3 was so deep then I place my SL below/above the 1 point. I am looking for a 1:1 RR minimum and a minimum return of 30 pips, if I can not see at least 30 pips potential I do not take the trade. Determining Targets is a little more difficult to explain, i go thru a process of assessment. Look Left, S&R levels Major or Minor, BRNs, Fib expansions, Trend lines, previous consolidation (part of S&R) but most of all I am looking for the strongest area of confluence. I do this before entering a trade (important) because i want to know if there is any point in hanging around waiting for an entry. I normally highlite these areas on my charts that I post. When do I move to B/E? Depends on PA. When do I use 2 TPs? Depends on PA and what obvious potential stalling points there are in between my entry and final TP.

Thanks Dee for the explanation , but the strange thing in EU trade that the stop loss location is in the inverse of the take profit location , the blue dash refers to take profit and the red dash refers for stop loss , is that correct ?

No. The red dash is always at the top and the Blue dash at the bottom regardless of whether the trade is long or short, or at least on my charts. I had the same problem for a while, trying to work out what they were for.

EU +40. UJ +30 +16. Couple of small ones today, I was not sure if I should throw them back in. EU 1hr 123 short. Tp was confluence at the bottom of 1hr channel, nearly got my trailing SL. UJ 123 long CT to TP at BRN. Then I could not resist a quick scalp short off the Pin Bar back to the TL that started the day.

it seems that it's related to MT4, I have MT4 build 625 and the stop loss is always red dash while blue dash is always take profit no matter what the trade is buy or sell, what's more important that you end up with green pips.....![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Yesterday EJ +40. Overnight & Today EJ +57 +105 +128. Yesterdays Trade was a BPC entry off the bottom of the 4hr Channel. TP was the rising Daily TL & the S&R level intersect. The overnight trade was based on Strong Divergence off the Daily trendline & S&R. There were a number of possible Tps so I set up for all of them as I would be asleep when this happened, checked the trade before going to bed, a 123 had formed so I moved SL up to underside of 123 for a B/E +22. Woke up to find that only TP 1 had been hit but I could move SL to underside of next 123 for a B/E +72 soon after that TP 2 was hit and an hour later TP 3.  
I was Happy ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Just want to add, that for those trading the NY session into the asian there was a nice 123 setup that would have yielded you a good 60 pips without too much heart ache.

I understand your question now! I am still on build 509 so I am about 2 years out of date, I suppose I had better bite the bullet and update to 625. Thanks for pointing out the difference, as I live in a world of my own I had not noticed.

just a reminder. The gap down on the EU has not yet been filled!!! I will not be posting any trades today. I just opened my platform to check on the market and had forgotten about the GAP, it is not a large one only 22 pips. May not get filled this side of easter.

thx for the reminder on eu.  
I haven't looked at it much lately, haven't traded anything lately,  
been busy arranging moving to relocate.   
I looked at eu/aud H1 last night in asia session, and spotted a 123 setup off a rising trendline  
entered at the break of pullback candle, exit at previous day high.  
This pair seems to be a better mover as of late.  
good weekend and Happy Easter to you all!

I think it is time to resurrect (pun intended) some information and guidance. As many Trading Nomads have an aversion to searching a thread for information, particularly the "attachments" section, here are a few relevant PDFs about the 123 trading pattern, it also does not hurt to refresh the minds of the current followers, myself included.

In addition, you may have noticed that I use the stochastics oscillator, I have done so for many years. Why?  
  
here is a description from "Stockcharts.com chart school. I found their explanation to be the simplest and most logical. [http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.p...tic_oscillator](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:stochastic_oscillator)  
  
"Developed by George C. Lane in the late 1950s, the Stochastic Oscillator is a momentum indicator that shows the location of the close relative to the high-low range over a set number of periods. According to an interview with Lane, the Stochastic Oscillator "doesn't follow price, it doesn't follow volume or anything like that. It follows the speed or the momentum of price. As a rule, the momentum changes direction before price." As such, bullish and bearish divergences in the Stochastic Oscillator can be used to foreshadow reversals. This was the first, and most important, signal that Lane identified. Lane also used this oscillator to identify bull and bear set-ups to anticipate a future reversal. Because the Stochastic Oscillator is range bound, is also useful for identifying overbought and oversold levels."  
  
Attached is a PDF "George C Lane Stochastics" he explains how to use the stochastics.

The reason I am including this information is, far too many traders use indicators that they actually know very little about. To them it signals an entry and that is it! They do not understand how! so therefore are not aware of the pitfalls of each indicator or the benefits of understanding the lesser known nuances.  
  
Watch this space for an explanation of the BOSO method ( buying the overbought and selling the oversold) using the Stochastic.

HAH! I have just updated over easter, and I have the same problem and I have tried all the solutions but none of them work. Compiling the indi informs me there are 3 errors, not much use to me as I can not code, I can edit but I do not know how to edit the errors. Can any one post a working version for Pippinfresh? I do not need it.

The more of these I read the more I laugh, this is what keeps the market moving, one person buys and one sells.  
  
Here is my analysis of the market for the next couple of days.  
  
I predict that some currencies will go up while others will go down but I advise caution because of current market sentiment, those currencies that I predict will rise might actually come down and those I predict will come down might actually rise, if sentiment changes during the next few days we could expect some currencies to consolidate for a period of time. The technicals show that a mandarin candle has recently collided with a satsuma candle but the lack of a granny smith means that it will be a lacklustre affair and price is likely to lay down for a rest.

The only workaround that worked for me is changing the ZigZag value to 5 or 7 , I use the same indicator that is found on this thread over 625 build, maybe it's a good reason for me to go and learn MQL4 programming

That's right, when you first talked about them and I followed them occasionally and they have a good analysis.

EU +24 123. UJ +30 123. Slim pickings this week so far. I really do not expect much movement with this weeks data. I had to close out my EU trade as strong divergence formed at a BRN, my initial TP was resistance at the bottom of the Gap. I took +35 off the EU on Monday and when Div formed on Tuesday I was tempted, but there was not much room for a profit with the bottom of the channel and a BRN so close, so I declined the offer.

> EU +24 123. UJ +30 123. Slim pickings this week so far. I really do not expect much movement with this weeks data. I had to close out my EU trade as strong divergence formed at a BRN, my initial TP was resistance at the bottom of the Gap. I took +35 off the EU on Monday and when Div formed on Tuesday I was tempted, but there was not much room for a profit with the bottom of the channel and a BRN so close, so I declined the offer. {image} {image}

Yes, and the Hidden divergence which I did not mark on the chart, there was also a small 123 on the 15m chart.

I'm not sure where I read that the price taps on a level " could be a trend " 3 times before it breaks or revers , I noticed that it may tap 5,7 times before break or reverse from that level.

Hi Dee,  
  
I have a question on my mind from long time a go , I noticed in many cases that the price for EU makes a new low " mostly at or before London open " and when it breaks the previous low " mostly the Asian session " it's gets up and make a new high. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f643.png?v=15.1)  
I try to range the Asian session or Tok_5H and then whenever the price breaks that box it goes directly to the opposite direction,sometimes it continues south but other times it gets back along with the long term trend, is there a way to separate this behavior from the other ?

UJ +30. EJ +40. Both perfect 123 setups Hidden Divergence off major S&R level. TPs based on recent ranges and so the nearest confluence of S&R and BRN was the target.  
  
All done for this week, much poorer this week than normal but I can at least buy some bird seed to keep the hunger pangs at bay.

nice trades Dee,  
divergence with 123 ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)  
I was watching ej last night in Asia session waiting for a sell, and when I woke up I saw it happened in Lo ,  
must say I do enjoy trading 123 formations with TDI confirmation, feel it has sharpened my trading skills.  
For me there was one CT scalp trade today on eu/aud M5 with a small 10 pips sl, moved to BE plus 2pips after +15 in profit.  
short term support, divergence and 123, TDI green and red crossing yellow at 32 level.  
exit at 200ema for +19.  
nice weekend to you all..

EU is not a good example the asian range is so small that even a small european candle will break the range. I had a look at AU and EJ, over 100 days, that have larger asian ranges and I would not say that the behaviour is predictable enough to trade. There was a method used by eelfranz before he used TMS, I investigated it a few years ago but I did not feel that it was a viable method "for me". I have attached a PDF, maybe this will help you, although as you have the TOK-_5h indi I suspect you are already aware of this. One thing that came of this for me was it confirmed PHx62's statement that the High or Low of the European session is often formed in the first couple of hours of trading.

I had a look at AU and EJ, over 100 days, that have larger asian ranges and I would not say that the behaviour is predictable enough to trade. There was a method used by eelfranz before he used TMS, I investigated it a few years ago but I did not feel that it was a viable method "for me". I have attached a PDF, maybe this will help you, although as you have the TOK-_5h indi I suspect you are already aware of this. One thing that came...

Thank you for the valuable PDF, it seems after all many traders think in the same way, it's just a note that I have seen and I wanted to think loudly.  
Yes I have the indicator for Tok_5H and I agree with you about Phx note

The 3 Secrets to Trading Momentum Indicators pt3.  
  
I am editing this post today. 30/04/2014  
  
Thanks to "Helee's" post down below, I have been able to replace the 2 over sized PDFs with 1 realistic sized.

This book was written as an E Book so in the right hand column you will see 2 Hyperlinks. "viewchart" & "hidechart" if you hover your mouse over these a chart will appear relevant to the explanation on that page, once you have looked at the chart repeat with the mouse and the text will re appear.

EU +40. 123 TTE entry. Double Top, Pin Bar with Divergence followed by Hammer at the top of a descending Channel. TDI cross down at the 68. Double Top stochastics, Early entry, damn right! But if you were unsure the 123 confirmation came a candle later, I expected a strong move down, but not a nose dive, I actually expected the same yesterday but I ended up closing manually for 12 pips, today I was not giving anything back, I trailed my SL all the way down.

Nice trades Dee as usual , I noticed that you still draw the trendine and allow it to be broke with tow candles, I know that it's an internal trend but I had the impression that the trend line will always be touched or broke, is that right ?

I drew the trend line to see if it gave me an area of confluence for my TP, it was an internal trend line that had been broken by a significant amount so I was not expecting price to pay too much attention to it, if it had not been broken then I would have assigned more value to it as a barrier. The short term S&R held more weight for me and price had reacted to it over the last 7 days but I prefer to see more than just 1 indication where price is likely to stall out. I put the Fib expansion on the chart as well but that showed the 200% 15 pips higher up and again with no confluence.

Thank you very much Helee. I downloaded it and it works a treat much better than the other 6 I tried. I have replaced the 2 PDFs with 1 with a more realistic file size.

EU +37 +50. This was a PA entry but a 123 did form after my entry to confirm the move up. Major Divergence at a S&R level at 50% Fib Retr & BRN. TDI Bounce and Stochs 123. Break of asian high. I let this run into the news as ADP is not much of a threat and as it turned out GDP trumped ADP but I had moved my SL up to lock in some profit so I was prepared to give back a few pips.

One a day keeps the hunger pangs away! AU +39. Pin Bar/Dbl Top with Divergence at S&R and channel top and BRN. 15m 123 confirms direction a little later, closed this manually when Hidden divergence formed only 11 pips shy of my Target so I can live with that.  
  
Nothing looked even remotely inviting on my other pairs so this will have to do, any way you do not need to monitor 20 pairs just for one trade a day.

You just summarized all what is about good trading ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1) ,  
BTW : I noticed that you changed Stoch to 8,3,7 and you used to use it as 8,3,3 . was that because of the book ?

Hi there,  
i tried installing the 123 indicator on my MT4 platform, but when i load it on the chart it freezes and i have to ctrl+alt+del it.  
Any ideas how to fix this?

Stochs 8,3,7. The book was part of the reason, the other was what I read here.  
  

  
so I thought I would try a different setting and see, so far I have no complaints. Setting the smoothing to 7 has cleaned up the indi it is less frantic, you have to look a little harder for the divergences but that is no hardship.  
  
Also this setting re-inforces the claim that the Stochs is predictive, I am not going to explain why, let's see if you can work out why. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f923.png?v=15.1)

NFP EU +50 +35 +40. I was short with limit orders prior to the release, my first TP of 50 was only just hit I closed out my 2nd manually for 35, I then entered long for a fade scalp because if you look at the stochs a 123 swing failure had formed. 2 red candles were not able to take the stochs down to OS indicating no momentum down. This became a 40 pip reversal back up.

I'm sure that you are not talking about the obvious overbought/oversold state for Stochs as I've seen in many cases that when the price is on oversold still the price could go down for another 200 pips, for me anything other than price is a lagging indicator and the interpretation process depends on the traders experience.   
from the Book I understood that whenever that the Stochs hocks or hings then you have one or two days before reversal " that's for stock market on a daily chart with slowing 10" , and from the link I understood that with all the back tests _**A slowing >= 6 is recommended**_.  
I hope I'm close to the right answer......![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)  
  
I learned form you that divergence for Stochs moves cannot be taken with isolation , there have to be other confirming or confluence parts from price action and general context of the moves and honestly I feel what's more important your close relation with the pair that you reach a point you know it as a close friend of yours as you can read up his mind and tell him what he really needs to do even though he doesn't need to speak to tell you what's going on.  
I've read about many peoplewho doesn't use any indicator and depend only on price action, just naked old candlesticks and they have a successful results, and mostly they only monitor specific instrument and not any thing on the chart, it seems dedicating the study to one pair or having all the concentration for one instrument would have a better results and I find this concept much better for good results and better trading psychology

I can not add any thing to what you have said other than to compliment you on your understanding of what is happening. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)

I do have a "contentious" opinion about Price Action. And I must emphasise that this is just my opinion. I do not expect you or any one else reading this to have to agree with me.  
  
Price reveals the intention of the market prior to any other thing, does it? Every thing else lags behind price! Absolutely true. "Everything" does lag behind price.  
  
Think about it, where is price on a chart? it is to the far right, there is nothing else beyond it, it is the thing that moves a pip at a time, that is the actual price.  
  
The next thing we see on a chart is the result of this price movement. Individual Candles, Individual bars, What are these? "Indicators", of what "has" happened. How long does it take for one of these indicators to complete? are they ahead of Price? No. What they do is form recognizable Patterns from which we make a decision.  
  
How does this differ from what is happening at the bottom of our charts?  
  
But what we are seeing at the bottom of our charts is "Lagging"!!  
  
The only thing that is lagging is the individual traders ability to understand and interpret what they are seeing.  
  
This is a very simplistic explanation of my opinion, in reality a whole discussion (argument) could be had but it is not one that I will participate in because agreement would never be reached. There will always be differing opinions and every one is entitled to theirs.  
  
Attached is an example of how an indicator in combination with other things helped me make the decision to take a reversal and how for me, the indicator pattern "predicted" the reversal.

Yes you are right. I have plenty of stuff to get done before it gets much hotter, we are at 30 degree centigrade already, much warmer than normal. News calender is very weak <http://www.bloomberg.com/markets/economic-calendar/> so I will take the rest of the week off, thanks for the thought.

Dee,  
  
Just been studying this chart. My volumes don't seem to agree with you. I know different brokers will register different exact volumes, but I wanted to try and 'see' a similar relative difference in volumes as you did; I tried these 3 methods.  
  
The top is a MACD. The histogram does show a declining interest in candle B. The middle volume chart simply uses the volume indicator provided on my Mt4 platform. As you can see here, Candle B actually shows declining volumes. The bottom chart is something I found on FF called Better Volumes.  
  
Can you please tell me which indicator you used for your volumes?

> {quote} Dee, Just been studying this chart. My volumes don't seem to agree with you. I know different brokers will register different exact volumes, but I wanted to try and 'see' a similar relative difference in volumes as you did; I tried these 3 methods. The top is a MACD. The histogram does show a declining interest in candle B. The middle volume chart simply uses the volume indicator provided on my Mt4 platform. As you can see here, Candle B actually shows declining volumes. The bottom chart is something I found on FF called Better Volumes....

I just used the Data window, but every broker is going to show a different volume relative to what their customers are doing. If you want a real comparison, I took these numbers off my futures platform which reports true volume in the futures market, in other words every one sees the same thing unlike the Spot forex market.  
Candle A. 54,393. Candle B. 25,148. Candle C. 44,631. But do not tie yourself up, The purpose of that chart was just to highlite how the Stochs in that instance was predictive of the turn by showing a 123 reversal. What youre exercise reveals is that my Forex broker reported significantly different volumes and yet people maintain that the volume reported by each broker is usually relative to what is happening in the Forex market. Here is a clear example of that not being true.!!!! I should have known better and not shown the volumes, my apologies for any confusion. 

Cut your Losers short and let your Winners run.

Thank you Dee. I'll be looking out for similar stoch behaviour in future.  
  
Could I ask one more question? Referring to the same chart. You mention major support and resistance. How do you determine important S&R. When I looked at that chart, I could not see it as being a 'major' S&R - just one of several S&S zones; but I do have a tendency of drawing too many S&R lines. What do you look for? How do you determine which is more important than another?

Remember what it said in the book about Indicator Patterns. Here is the Proof. EU +30 +75. Indicator 123. Backed up by Daily, 4hr & 1Hr Divergences at the High of the day. All you had to do was find an entry point. Regardless of what all these "experts" are telling you about the euro, let the charts show the way.

This is a difficult one to explain on paper, I could show you in 10 mins if you were sat next to me, I have just spent the last hour trying to write down how I do it and it came out as garbage, even I got confused. But we will start with the attached charts, you might be cleverer than me and get it in one, if not keep asking until we get there, but just remember I do not do overtime.  
  
The pin bar with divergence has nothing to do with the S&R lines, I just noticed it forming and made a note.

EU +50 123 Entry. I have been rich, I have been poor (many times), so now I just aim to be middle class. Take sensible profits if you are a day trader, let your profits run if you are a swing trader. Either way cut your losses short or better still do not have any!! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f923.png?v=15.1) Today was an easy day for entry, the weekly was showing us the way. The indicator 123s helped show us where to get in. If you did not take the first 123 then there was the channel Breakout Pullback at the weekly S&R, which I deleted, which actually formed a second smaller 123.

nice trades , Dee!  
Spring is definitely a busy time for many of us, I was out of town most of last week, and had appointments right in   
the middle of NY sessions this week. I took a couple of trades on ej, and some on eaud, but didn't have time to come around   
to post them daily.  
Caught this trade on ej H1 early today morning, a continuation of yesterday's downtrend.  
The other ej trade was taken on the 7th, in the asia session, at the 50% fib. ret. of the previous day (H1), M15 pinbar on 200/ 800ema with divergence and TDI cross.  
The e/aud trades on H1 were all TDI cross trades, one of them on the 8th a CT trade with divergence.  
I am hoping to have more time next week. Have a good weekend everyone.

ES e-mini S&P +34 Pips. Watching Paint Dry, short hand for Forex Trading. 123 works on any instrument in any market and stocks are a little more volatile at the moment than the Forex market. So I waited for the cash session of the E-mini S&P to start at 15.30 CET and a very nice 123 was waiting for me. Chart is from my Futures platform so looks a little different but tells the same story.

That's Cool Dee, today is killing boring time for Forex and it's a good choice to look for other chances elsewhere , I didn't know that you trade indices , I find them very dangerous for me and I wish there is better information about them to try them out someday.

I started my trading career with e-mini S&P 1min chart, I eventually found that to be too slow for me and I discovered Tick Charts and started trading 89 Tick charts as you can imagine this was extremely exhilarating and not at all profitable I thought the problem was that the e-mini S&P was too brutal so I started trading the mini Dow & the mini Russell as well, still using Tick charts. If you are not aware Tick charts are the equivalent of Super Turbo Charged formula one cars, they are fast! The 1min chart looks like an old banger in comparison. Trading the Dow and the Russell did not make me any more profitable and I started the quest for the "System" that would save me. This went on for 2 years and then I worked it out, the rest is history.  
  
The indices are not dangerous, like all instruments you just have to get to know their character. Oil on the other hand, is a slippery customer, that one did Rip down my Pants and molest me on more than one occasion.  
  
There were a couple of Forex Brokers that had the S&P, Dow, Oil and a few other commodities available on their Metatrader platforms, I can not remember who at the moment but I will have a look around.

Alpari UK offers Indices and commodities. I only trade Gold future (my account type does not allow for Gold spot) so can't speak much about their other non-forex offers. I did notice, however, that their UK100 offering differs from the actual FTSE by 30-50 pips.

If you are not aware Tick charts are the equivalent of Super Turbo Charged formula one cars, they are fast! The 1min chart looks like an old banger in comparison....

That's awesome....! I knew that you have along experience with this and this didn't happen with you over night ....![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) , it seems that everyone learns with this market only with the hard way.....  
  
I'm not sure why everyone says the same about oil , I see it easier than other pairs " I'm sure that I don't have the right picture about it! " but a lot of experienced people says that it's very unstable and a lot of people got eventually lost a lot of money with it  
there are a lot of brokers who offer MT4 platform for Dow and S&P , and to be honest with you I've monitoring DAX on 1 Min chart and I've kind of like it and feel I may work on it , it may look very volatile but like anything on this market some rules work sometimes and others don't.

EU +38 +50 pending. There was a 123 Entry on the 15 min chart just below the BRN. I entered a few pips earlier based on momentum. Will it make it to my final TP. Taken 1 lot off for 38, SL at BE +10, left a runner for 50 at the BRN, but there is a possible divergence at the close of the candle and Indis are at the threshold of the OS.

EU +38 +50. It Made it to my final TP. Divergence did not kick in at the candle close but there is still room for it to form. I had moved my SL down to BE +32, just in case. I know that Price will go down lower, but I am not in a competition to see who can hold their trade the longest, I am in the business of banking Pips at the lowest risk possible and I resent giving "any" back. So There!

I knew were gonna go for the eu! nice  
  
I had a long trade on ej entered in asia session, it was a ct trade with moderate tp based on   
divergence , TDI cross, mbl coming out of overbought, and general steep sloping of ema and MBL.  
That trade missed my tp by 3 pips while I slept and hit BE.  
Luckily I woke up just after 5am this morning, and saw the reversal entered short, +plus 50 hit

EJ +70. No wonder it is taking so long for my TPs to get hit, you lot are clearing all the money out of the market before hand. if you did not catch this entry, a 123 formed on the 15m, entry at the BRN 140.50 which also confirmed continuation.

EJ +58. Not a good 15m Pin Bar but supported by strong Divergence, combined with a good signal on the TDI. Sentiment is down so short we went, nice clean ride down with a little pause at the channel breakout giving a BPC, as expected, then just plopped down to give me my pips, note, these are My Pips no one else's. I also entered on the EU under identical circumstances, expecting a similar drop, it went down 15 pips but reversed on a 15m Pin bar I closed out for a B/E +2, hardly worth showing a chart for.

nothing spectacular for me today,  
2 trades entered in asia session,  
eaud H1 multiple 123s, consolidation breakout, TDI cross below mbl. I had a longer tp set  
but it didn't go there so closed for +36.  
ej H1 similar setup, daily showed 123 as well, break out in asia session turned out to be an early entry  
continued to consolidate until London open, set my SL to 30 pips, and went to bed, closed out this morning for +44

Dee, do you use a trade manager EA to take partial profits on your trades or manual?  
I am looking for an EA to take partial lotsize off trades at tp1 and leave remaining open with sl at BE.  
I use visual order EA, but that can only set sl to BE, and that's it

gj was a clear winner today, with 150 pips move down, news had helped for sure,  
LO h1 showed nice pinbar hanging on 200ema, and TDI green crossing red right below mbl and touching it.  
That's what was missing on my ej H1 setup, I find the best pullbacks on tdi happen when it goes back to the mbl,  
M15 confirmed the setup with 3 point divergence and tdi cross. (200 and 800emas on top of each other when a setup occur can predict big moves)  
and of course 123s on h1.   
just thought to share, hope you guys don't mind

I don't use a Trade Manager EA. Have you tried Cavemanager. PHx62 was using it don't know if he still does.  
  
Try here if you do not have it. EA & PDF instructions.

ES. +40 123. EU +40. MTGBWY Entry (May the gods be with you). Am I proud of this entry method? why of course, by leaving it in the hands of a higher power I guaranteed it's success. Who else could have foreseen that the market would take any notice of what a "Spanish" newspaper said, has every one gone mad?  
  
The ES trade was a try out, Geomoon I actually found this on my MT4 platform I had no idea that all these stocks and commodities are available with this broker. [Ironfx](/brokers/ironfx "View IronFX Broker Profile"). <https://www.ironfx.com/en/register>

Hi Dee,  
  
Do you apply the same strategies from Forex to indices ? the pip value for indices are a lot higher than Forex and most what of I seen people try to scalp small number of point and don't go for big number of pips,right ?

In essence, you are right. But I would not recommend any trader tries to scalp the ES with out first having traded Higher TFs. The ES rarely moves smoothly in one direction, it whipsaws around because there are so many traders trading it all pushing or pulling in their own directions. The main reason many traders start on the ES is because it is a highly liquid instrument and you very rarely if ever never get filled even during news time, slippage is also low because of the sheer volume of orders going thru.

A little diversion. In the last 6 days the Euro has fallen 300 pips, however, there have actually been 412 pips available to the Day Trader during LO to Euro close. Here is a chart to illustrate that there are some benefits to being a Day Trader.  
  
I think that the names given to things in Trading are rather boring and none descript at the bottom of the chart I have put a couple of alternatives, perhaps you would like to submit some alternatives and we will see if we can make trading more interesting.

eaud H1 "Hope this keeps going up" entry  
double bottom, slight divergence,   
decided to enter after a strong bullish candle close, followed by very steep TDI cross,  
entered at the open of second blue candle on H1 chart.  
Later on I noticed if someone was patient enough, the m5 chart showed a nice consolidation back to the steep angled 10ema( I use)  
with 123 formation.

123 entry after consolidation and TDI cross right below MBl,   
exit -5, there was divergence I guess,

Nothing wrong with being late, here in Spain it has become an art form and they still make a living.

If you got caught out by yesterdays news reaction, here is what should have made you very cautious!!  
  
Easy to see with hindsight, but there were plenty of warnings before the news. News was after the dotted vertical line.

An excellent article from Jupafx over at Order Flow Trading. I sometimes feel that I have learnt too much about trading and as a consequence find myself procrastinating about an entry because my analysis had gone one step too far. But, articles like this remind me of the "Useful" information that is out there offered up by those who have gone before.

> An excellent article from Jupafx over at Order Flow Trading. I sometimes feel that I have learnt too much about trading and as a consequence find myself procrastinating about an entry because my analysis had gone one step too far. But, articles like this remind me of the "Useful" information that is out there offered up by those who have gone before.

I think this is what adds difficulty to trading , as it's subjective and depend on the traders experience , that's why you would see successful traders with a certain strategy but if someone else used that strategy he will not have the same results.   
You could have three reasons to take a trade but at the minute you want to take it you see one reason not to take it so you walk away and you discover later that this was the right decision " or could be the opposite " , and that applies to to close a trade.  
having a clear mind set is the challenge with rules competing over their priorities and you could easily end up with analysis paralyses unless you pay your time screen time.....

It is not difficult before trying anything all seems difficult. But if you start with it then you will see that it is too easy for you.

ES +48. 123 Entry. I did not trade today, so here is yesterdays ES trade. You are getting my ES trades the next day because they run until 10pm (my time) and much as I am dedicated to your development as professional traders, 10pm at night really is my limit, especially as I start at 8.00am (my time) I hope you understand.  
I am not sure that I like trading the ES because my working day has increased significantly, but, this is where pips are, so I will stop bitching and suck it up. You feel me? (The Wire)  
  
By the way. Is anybody there??

Same here dee, I check every post every day to try to see what you're seeing, and be amused by your humour!  
Also, excuse my ignorance..what is ESM4? Doesn't seem to be available on my broker. 

We all see the same dream, just from different viewpoints

As always well trading Dee.....![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
I was a little bit busy this week and I was enjoying reading your posts and just got the chance to reply to the thread thanks for sharing.  
what I like most about your trades that you don't stick to the idea that you don't have to trade everyday, but you trade good well setups and chances which applies the concept of working smarter not harder.  
  
I'm trying to understand your way for S&P trading and it seems very close to currencies , are they traded the same way ?

Down below I have prepared a post that should help you with your query about how I draw S&R lines, which I never really finished. This should help.

ESM4 is the Forex broker equivalent of the ES e-mini S&P 500. it is not available on all Forex brokers. I use this broker. <https://www.ironfx.com/en/register>.  
Who has a whole load of stocks and index's available to trade. I think Alpari is another one and there are a few more.

Yes, you just need to be aware of how the ES moves, unlike the currencies the ES tends to whipsaw it's way up or down. a lot of Pro Traders trade the ES and you can see lots of 100, 200 contracts being placed and absorbed this makes the ES jump up and down a bit more, but once you have got used to it, it trades the same way as any other instrument.

Hi Dee50,  
  
Any chance you would be kind enough to post some live trades?   
  
Maybe the entry analysis, a bit of mid trade commentary and the trade close.  
  
Would be great for all the readers to look through your lenses and increase their understanding regarding decisions made at those specific points in time.  
  
Greatly appreciated! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

here is the season finale in the "The 3 secrets to Trading Momentum Indicators" you might find the ending surprising, if not a little obvious. I personally felt that it was a little rushed and a little more emphasis could have been given to the relationship between the 3 MAs and how they used Candlesticks![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1).

Just a reminder.  
  
The Best Times To Trade the Forex Market  
  
Basic stuff I know, but some times we pass on the obvious because we are looking for the more complicated.

**There are times in the market that regularly produce trades on a consistence basis. You will witness volume at these specific times.**

  1. 2am EST: The German open. This begins the day, and breaks the slow choppy price action of the Asian session.

  1. 3am EST: The London open. This is often the exact reversal of the German open

  1. 8.00-8.30am EST: 90 minutes before the opening bell begins the attempt into the gap fill for the open.(Futures)

  1. 10am EST: Most big money will wait for the first half hour after the bell to place their first trades of the day. The 10am time frame produces more entries than any other.

  1. 11.30am EST: 30 minutes before the European close. This is called the 11:30 reversal period, the beginning of the daily doldrums. We usually witness profit taking in the opposite direction from whatever the main direction of the morning was.

  1. 1.30-2.00pm EST: The end of the daily doldrums. This is many times a stop run from the consolidation of the slow choppy lunch time trade
  2. 3.30-3.45pm EST: An attempt at a run toward the daily pivot for the next day.

Stick to these specific times and you will find yourself in the beginning of trends as they develop, normally!  
  
A word of caution.  
Remember we are in the summer doldrums, now is the time to adjust not just your clocks but also your Pip expectations. What was a 5 minute 10 pip scalp will now take 2 hours or more. So put aside your frustrations and accept that these are leaner times and do not enter a trade just because you feel you should be in the market.

Price projections from yesterday. Note that YELLOW line is 50% Fib Retr. RED line is 61.8% Fib Retr. (line in the sand). Target is GREEN DOTTED lines 123% Exp & 161.8% Exp. I marked the first chart. These projections were done on a futures account so 6E is EU, 6B is GU, the rest are as normal. The method and charts come from here. <http://eminiaddict.com/>

> Just a reminder. The Best Times To Trade the Forex Market Basic stuff I know, but some times we pass on the obvious because we are looking for the more complicated. {image} There are times in the market that regularly produce trades on a consistence basis. You will witness volume at these specific times. 2am EST: The German open. This begins the day, and breaks the slow choppy price action of the Asian session. 3am EST: The London open. This is often the exact reversal of the German open 8.00-8.30am EST: 90 minutes before the opening bell begins...

Thanks for the valuable info Dee..., I was wondering why the markets are so slow those days , and as you cleared that it's natural at summer, maybe it's time to take a vacation...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f973.png?v=15.1)

EU News. So far 1st TP +18 pips. SL B/E +2  
Will you or Wont you Trade. Crap GDP cancels out better Employment figures. Final TP +35. Will sentiment be enough to give me a profit today? The rest of America comes online in a couple of minutes then we will see.

Luv this from Mike Paterson over at Forexlive.com![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
quote.  
Did someone mention a happy pill ?  
  
It’s Friday and yes it’s been a long week, albeit a 4-day one for the UK and US but I’d hate to leave you all on a negative note as I head out for the week-end  
These markets are now what they are.Tight, scrappy, low volume, frequently mind-blowingly numb affairs but we simply have to deal with that.  
No point being miserable or moaning about it. Just get on with it as it’s not going to change anytime soon, if at all.And if you have to adapt your trading style/time frames then so be it. There’s enough experience in this wonderful Forex community to help as needed.  
  
So have a great week-end all you good people and let’s stay happy. unquote.  
  
That EU News trade yesterday, did not move any further down than my 1st TP, in fact went back up and hit my SL for +2 pips. What a week!!

I like it too, you just have to deal with it and take the happy pill ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f64c.png?v=15.1)  
It also helps if you search for pairs with higher adr value.   
I did that the other day and for example g/au has 130 pips adr, also gcad 100.  
btw here we went straight to summer from winter had not a day of spring, so Iam  
happy to be outside and enjoy the sun.  
Speaking of news there was a pretty 123 setup on gcad m15 this morning 30 minutes after cad news release  
I missed it , next time I'll pay more attention to FF calendar.

EU +2 +15. EU +13 +28. 123 Entry visible on 1 hr & 15m Charts, went to 1st TP for +15 then came back and took my SL for +2. BPC entry. Everything pointed to this just being a pullback, so a tight SL and off we go again. 1st Tp easy, 2nd TP I was not sure about as a potential Divergence was forming. I thought price might go above the BRN upto 1.3670 to collect the Stops sitting above that High, but I was being a bit too optimistic for a Friday.  
  
The chart says it all, everything was pointing to the EU going up today, Rising TL. Also Rising TL on the TDI and Stochs, Failure of Stochs and TDI to come back down to the 32 level, etc etc.  
  
There was an identical setup on the EJ, put with so few pips in the pot I was not going to stretch myself thin.  
At least I did not finish the week with just 18 pips.

I took one intraday trade on ej this week H1 NY session  
for 30 pips.  
Two H4 trades on eu showing divergence , tdi moving out of OS and crossing  
and 123. because it only started moving today and being friday I took profits.  
Gu H1 entered late last night on 123 and TDI coming out of OS.  
Last one is my first trade on GA, couple of 123s, nice tdi angle and steep 10ema  
both gu and ga would've made it to my set 50 pips tp if I had waited patiently .

Seek and ye shall find. searching thru multiple pairs is not for me, if I don't know it I don't touch it. Anyway all those lines and colours would be too psychedelic for me, reminds me too much of my younger days experimenting with chemicals. But it works for other people, but for me at my time of life, trading "The Exotics" is something I leave to you youngsters.

Perhaps you could explain for me. What range of ADR do you look for before deciding that a pair is tradeable, what look back period do you use to asses the ADR. Is a prior ADR sufficiently reliable to predict enough pips to trade on or is it like most things trading, as reliable as a coin toss?![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f64f.png?v=15.1) How many pairs do you screen. What is the meaning of life. Should I change my sexual orientation. Are my potatoes ready for harvesting. So many questions ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f615.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/2753.png?v=15.1)  
  
Low ADR? Here is the solution.

Please note. Here is a Basic Truth!! The methods I use are not magic, they work because I have spent "Years" trading this way using the same method day after day. Neither you nor any one else will have the same level of success, initially. However, if you continue with the TMS method and add the 123 method to it you will be heading in the right direction. 

Cut your Losers short and let your Winners run.

Hi dee50,  
  
I need your advise for below.  
  
1) When 123 pattern form do you enter pending order above or below (buy/sell) near point 2 or what method do you use?  
2) When TDI Green Red cross Do you consider MBL & 50/68/32 area on TDI when enter trade on 123 pattern ?  
3) As i realized by your previous reply,you only trade EJ/EU/AU/UJ pairs.So pls advise what market you trade thees pairs & what is the best time to trade these pairs ?  
  
Thanks,  
Helanka

Following Imi's comments about the ADR of various pairs, I thought I would have a look into it for myself. Rather than have loads of charts open all over the place, I wanted results in a tabulated form, this is what I have come up with so far (it's the weekend, sad bastard aren't I?).

Anyone have any idea if you can import Profiles? If so how? otherwise you will have to create the layout yourselves which is not that difficult, File, Profiles, click on Default. File, New Chart, pick pair. Apply template. repeat for other pairs. Then just select Window, Tile Horizontally.

EU +15 +30. 123 Entry. Signalled on 4 hr and 1 hr. Exited 2nd TP manually. Every thing is on the chart. Do not know if ADR was a help or a hindrance, because it was showing room for price to go down, only 10 pips, but I was hesitant, but with both TDI and Stochs OS. Maybe given some time I will be able to work the info from ADR into my trading. I can see possibilities but it will require a lot of back testing to convince me.

EU +15 +25. News Trade. ISM was a complete balls up, they miscalculated????. So back into sentiment for EU. Rejected at Falling Trendline confluence of 61.8% Retr. Then rejected at 50% Retr, lower high at short term S&R. 1st TP was obviously BRN, but BRN had been acting as support quite a few times already. 2nd TP was the 123.8% Projection for +35 pips. There was an S&R in between which could hold things up so I checked ADR table and it showed 7 pips available also divergence formed on TDI and stochs was OS, so I closed manually for +25. You should also note that there was confluence of the S&R level and the BTM of the channel, so a few things were saying, "Enough for today".

EU +24 +40. Price Action Entry. 6th Bounce off 1.3590 - 80 Support level. Bounce off Bottom of channel. Divergence. What more do you want? I initially targeted the 50% retr, but the 123 formed on the 1hr and 15m confirming upward momentum so took 1 contract off and let the other run, then price blew thru the 61.8% and I initially considered the Range top as TP for +50 but ADR said not. So I went for the channel top for +40. As it happens price would just have missed a TP of 50 by 1 pip and I would have been scrambling for 45. I am happy with 40.  
  
if you did not see the PA entry, the 123 that followed would have given you an easy 30pips.  
  
I am done. Have a nice day.

Hi all,

beautiful weather ,good activities.  
Back to trading yesterday, had 3 BE trades, after each being up +20 pips,   
guess I wasn't nimble enough to catch tp soon.  
Here are today's trades .one ga after the news in asia session last night,  
and two this morning on eu and ecad. On the ecad I actually had the H4 chart open and accidentally entered  
believing I was on h1. all charts are H1

Dee, I am not too fussy about the adr, this is the one I have on my charts.  
I'd been reading PHX62's posts and pdfs, and know he prefers to trade pairs that have and adr value of 100 or above

That text is far too small for my eyes, I would need to use a magnifying glass, can you picture that?  
  
I can see how using ADR can be beneficial in Consolidating/Ranging markets but it could be a hindrance in a strongly trending market taking me out far too soon. In the end it is just another tool and like all tools it depends on how you use it as to what you can create with it.

Update. EU news trade. +2 +2. 1 order still running. But what an arsehole, one of my SLs got taken even though price went no where near it and my first TP, price went thru it but did not fill it, this is one of the reasons I stayed away from the Spot Forex market for all these years. The same TP on my futures platform was filled and that SL was not taken so I still have 2 orders running on my futures platform. Spot Forex is not a level playing field and most of the time I do not bitch about it, but when the market is like this and it is hard to make a profit, the last thing you need is this sort of shit!!

Nice trade.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1) Clean 123, but it is coming to something when we have to go down to the 5 min chart to find an entry on E/AUD

nice trades guys, congrats.  
I wasn't so lucky today, entered sell on ej H1 last night, I made a screenshot while the trade was in progress  
had set breakeven to come in at +26 pips, and before I went to bed was even thinking to remove it and just let the sl and tp on.   
Then this morning I had no access to my MT4 , it was not responding, took me over 2 hours trying to access it.  
Then see what happened to my trade, bad luck, but was only my fault, really

EU +15 Pip early morning, and +20 Pip trading NFP news, both 123, I took the trade just before the news as the setup was tempting with a small lot and didn't trust that it will last , luck seems to be on my side today.  
have a nice weekend everyone.

I entered this on rebound from high, after release of NFP. NFP's results were within range of expected results and I guessed there was a possibility of price coming back to where it was before the news release. In addition, the move above the previous day's high was not convincing as it closed below the high with a pin bar on the M15.  
Normally I see Dee and Phx62 taking trades off pinbars on H1 so there was some risk taking it off the M15 but I was counting on momentum seeing price to at least the low of the large up bar i.e. prior to news release. Bagged 25 pips.  
  
My question though is this: Was my analysis foolish? Yes, price worked in my favour. On the M5 a clear 1-2-3 did form but I entered prior to breakout of 2 as I was watching the M15. On M15, TDI just broke back into the blue line. On M5 (looking in hindsight), TDI had crossed beautifully.

You made 25 pips, ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1) so who cares if you were foolish or not.  
  
Your analysis was just fine, but you did not need to look at the 5min chart at all!! The 1hr was giving you all the information you needed, the 15m Pin Bar was just the icing on the cake. You had failure to close above the previous days high, yes, but more importantly you had Strong Divergence at a major S&R level with divergence showing on 1hr and 15m and also visible on the 4hr TDI. The 15m Pin Bar with divergence @ a major S&R just confirmed it.

You made 35 pips more than me, so I do not think I should be giving advice.  
  
I did not trade the NFP because the result 217k was too close to predicted 214k. In fact I was surprised that the EU went up at all based on those results and considering sentiment, and it did eventually go down, but the up move was probably the big boys picking up the stops above the S&R level as liquidity was a bit thin, so luck was indeed on your side, but then who said that trading was scientific?  
  
I see another 5m chart, are you all becoming scalpers?

Dee, you are already gazillion pips a head of me and I'm sure that you will forgive me today for my lousy 35 Pips .....![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1).  
I used the 5M chart during the news as I think at the NFP ,every minute counts and I didn't like the market response as usually the first minute would have a longer spike but sooner it was fading out losing momentum, I'm sure that it was pure luck and only experienced trader like you would choose the right decision by staying away in such condition and to be honest fear was all over me , I'm working on a real account now and my heart was going to be out of my chest during the news.  
I really have no Idea how you could trade the news and be calm...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f937-200d-2642-fe0f.png?v=15.1)

You had failure to close above the previous days high, yes, but more importantly you had Strong Divergence at a major S&R level with divergence showing on 1hr and 15m and also visible on the 4hr TDI. The 15m Pin Bar with divergence @ a major S&R just confirmed it. {image}

Thanks Dee. Really appreciate your reply. I saw the divergences and failure to close above previous day. I still don't quite get how to identify what is a major S&R - just saw resistance. Probably. Needed to look further to I the left of the charts?  
  
And no, I'm not trading off M5 - just post trading analysis.

If it isn't clear on your trading TF, go UP one. This might help.

Was expecting a quiet Monday but saw price movement on euro. Initially entered long - fell for the false breakout but managed to keep loss to -2. When price pulled back after failing to exceed, much less close above yesterday's high, entered short. Took trade off H1 and checked with M15. M15 showed TDI cross.  
Price seemed to move strongly down and at one stage I thought it would continue beyond yesterday's low. Had M15 up to see price action. Price stalled at yesterday's low so closed trade for +30. Will look for another chance to enter short if market shows trend.

I don't use this indicator. Try searching this thread - it's not a large thread. Use the search facility on the top left, or simply read a few pages back. I remember someone else having a similar problem with build 600+. and a solution or compromise was suggested.

Does anybody know how to adjust the alert to go off when when the second leg (the retrace) ends, effectively when the third dot is put on the chart?  
  
I want to be able to trade 61.8 retraces when they coincide with s/r or a moving average, rather than wait for price to clear the previous swing before the alert goes off.  
  
Hope this makes sense.

If you had read the thread you would have realised that "Robdee" the thread and indicator originator, last posted on this thread in January 2012. So there have been no updates to the 123patterns indicator since v7 in Dec 2011. If you are desperate he has a twitter page here <https://twitter.com/robdeeforex> but has not posted there since Dec 2012. There is also a link on his profile page. <http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~rdee/index.htm>

Sounds like you should post this query on the "Platform Tech" thread and see if some one can rewrite the indicator for you.

Good Analysis, Good execution and great Defence. Congrats on the +30 but even bigger congrats on limiting the loss to -2 pips. That's how you make profits!![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)

Hi Dee,  
I'm not sure as to how I got onto this page but I am glad that I did.  
  
I just want to say a BIG thank you for all your time, effort, charts and explanations. Your explanations are so simply put that it makes our learning so much easier.  
It makes learning for this 55 year old so much easier to understand. After reading all of your posts I think I have found my trading strategy/break. Need to now work at it and get it right.  
Thank you for your kindness in wanting to share your knowledge with us, especially to us that's new to trading.  
I will be looking at this post on a daily basis to look at your charts...  
BTW, I have read each and every post from the very beginning, made notes of all the pages that I need to reread for better understanding.  
  
Take care and God bless.

Thanks dee, I notice, looking back at your past trades, you take the aggressive (3) entries rather than waiting for price to go past (2). Do you use an indicator or are you always in front of the charts?

Dee, thanks for all of your insight, you are a great teacher. Took this trade today, BPC off a strong s/r level, I probably should have held onto it longer but I was happy with 15 pips

Although your settings for stochastic are the same as mine my chart doesn't show divergence like yours for the last trade, is it something related to broker datafeed ?

At most you might have squeezed out 5 pips more. If you are not sure where price may go for your TP, try the 123 measured move or look for confluence BRN, S&R. Channel Tops & Bottoms or in your case Pivots. I have marked them on a chart for you, I marked your Entry & Exit candles as a reference point. But all in all you exited at the correct point and 15 pips profit in this market is not too shabby.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)

Yes. This is another reason why Spot Forex is not a level playing field, we all get to see something different. There is absolutely no need for it. The differences are artificially engineered.

Hi Dee,  
Just to let you know that YOU have been a GREAT teacher to learn from.  
I have taken 1 trade yesterday on GJPY and I made 23pips.  
I have taken 2 trades today and won on both of them:  
GCHF x 20pips and on EGPB x 10pips.  
  
At this stage I only use the MAs and the TDI to time and take the trades. However, I would like to use your Indi the 123RH so that I can learn how to see the 123patterns when they are formed.  
I have downloaded the indi and it works. I would like to know if I should use it with your default settings as i am trading the 4H and 1H TF and managing the trades on the 15M chart.  
  
Your default settings are:  
Maxbars x 300 Aggression x 1 Behaviourswitches x 259 Rejectifheightlessthan x 15 Targetpercent123 x 100 Targetstart123 x 2   
Bandperiod x 20 Banddei x 2.0  
  
Thank you for your kind assistance.

Yeah, they can't be bothered to read for themselves. Only 73 pages to this thread, even less if you're "smart" enough to read from when MT600+ was introduced.

Thank you Dee for giving me your settings to the 123RH for the higher TF. This will make it a little easier for me to find trades on the 123 system you teaching.  
  
Thank you for your kind words of wisdom as well.  
I took a trade this morning on ENZD and got out with 63 pips.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f973.png?v=15.1) I hope this is not just a case of beginners luck but i do look at the charts very carefully before placing trades and i also try and read what PA is telling me at the time.  
All thanks to you my kind Sir.  
  
Take care.

Some thing for the weekend, sir.? Where to take Profits? it takes time and practice to see where price is likely to go and until you have the experience there is a way to "guess" more accurately, both methods shown on the chart have also been illustrated in the 123 Trading PDFs that are available. Price has a tendency to create patterns and because of this we can project where price is "likely" to go,  
  
The Measured Move.  
We are using the 123 pattern so we use the formula that CD is likely to be equal to AB. AB is the 1 to 2 leg, CD is the 3 to D leg.  
There are 2 methods that can be used,  
The Fib Expansion Tool, this is the true CD=AB because the price expansion is measured from point 3 (C).  
The Normal Fib Extension Tool, this is not the true CD=AB because the price expansion is measured from point 2 (B).  
(before you ask, I have used both methods and have no particular favourite, I use the "200" method most, but I could not tell you why).  
  
When using either of these methods look for confluence, this will help you asses the viability of the move.  
  
Use the Measured Move to determine if a trade is actually worth taking, is the Risk to Reward worth the aggravation.  
  
When and if you do a search for more information on The Measured Move, do not be confused by the ABCD Pattern, this is an entirely different trading pattern.

Thank you for your kind words of wisdom as well. I took a trade this morning on ENZD and got out with 63 pips.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f973.png?v=15.1) I hope this is not just a case of beginners luck but i do look at the charts very carefully before placing trades and i also try and read what PA is telling me at the time. All thanks to you my kind Sir. Take care.

and those willing to take time out to study his charts will see what we otherwise cannot see.  
  
Thank you for the 2 new charts posted and the Fib extensions. Will try and learn how to use them and incorporate it in my trading.  
Thank you Dee for everything.

Did I do something wrong here, other than not taking a profit when I had the chance? I moved my stop to BE and was trying to be patient, now I see there was a 123 on the 5m chart, but should I take signals from the 5min?

> Does Forex News Trading Really Work? Jarrat Davis explains why price sometimes moves in the opposite direction to what a news release suggests.

Just got around to watching this video. So, the advice when news trading is to look deeper into the news release to discover things that could move the currency in a different direction to what is expected. So you get the economic release and you have a little read, then you look at the chart, oops, it's already moved 100 pips. What I suspect is happening, is that people who pay for early news data, get wind of the extra detail and pile in, leaving everyone else on the wrong side of the trade.  
  
Using the 'news gun' on forexpeacearmy is my preferred method.

Mixed bag yesterday. Some poor decisions resulted in giving back early gains, resulting in Break even.  
  
This was trade was taken in Asian for +36. I had TP higher but price was stalling before Frankfurt Open. I did not want to give back any more pips. Hey ho. Soon after I got out, price shot up towards my target. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f624.png?v=15.1)  
  
Earlier in the day, I had EJ short. Price had trouble going further below 137.80. H4 shows a support zone in that region, so when H1 stalled and refused to go lower, I exited my short and looked for opportunity to go long.  
Price was forming a diagonal, TDI was compressing but MBL was going up. H1 also showed a triple bottom zone. M15 gave the entry.

IMHO if you need to look at the 5min chart for signals, you are looking at the wrong pair!  
  
Your entry was a little optimistic as you entered long on a Bearish Divergence, you did the right thing in moving to B/E as a second Bearish Divergence formed at a confluence area. Had you taken your 25 pip profit it would have been the perfect trade as every thing pointed to a reversal at the BRN. Unexpected news pushed price further down than it would ordinarily have gone. I have and still do take marginal entries, you did the right thing in controlling your potential loss and as long as you stick to that you will not go wrong. Well done!![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)

Just a reminder. Jarrat Davis Free Trading Course. video number 2 has been posted. Keep this in perspective, jarrat is looking to sign up people in the end, so he is unlikely to give away too much info, however if you are interested in News Trading the snippets he does give away are very interesting. Sign up for the 3 videos, it only needs an e-mail address.

What he is teaching is not new, I have been analysing the news in the same way for years, I originally picked up on it from Kathy Lien who produces a sentiment chart ahead of the News releases for members of hers and Boris Schlosbergs site. here is an example.

Give your confidence a boost, here is an excerpt from an ex Institutional Trader. From this thread. <http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=486128>  
  
  
"Retail traders, don't sell yourself short. What we looked at as far as technical, charts, fundamentals, etc is pretty much the same thing that you look at as well. The Spot guys would always talk about highs and lows and support and resistance. Some would use that to "run stops" (meaning getting the price to trade that level to uncover s/l loss orders in order to make a few pips. So be careful where you put your stops, the bank traders will gun for them if they can!!!! Also, there was never any Hedge Fund's that did anything you and I wouldn't do, if eur was selling off because of Draghi's comments they sold like the rest of us only in size. Don't be impressed with Hedge Funds at least when it comes to the spot market. They don't know anymore or are anymore sophisticated that you are, its just a matter of degree. I give you another example, the biggest FX fund (or at least most well know) out there when I was in the business was FX Concepts. They gave back their customers money a year or two ago because they couldn't make money trading FX.  
Give yourself some credit guys, if your making money be proud of yourself's....if not then you have to keep at it if you truly love it."

EU +50 15m 123 Entry. Nearly got suckered into the open breakout but the gods stayed my hand and instead I took the choice entry off a 6 tap S&R, Trend line and strong Divergence with a 15 min 123 followed by another creating the 1 hr 123 from which I took my eventual TP up at the top of the range with confluence at the 200% and a trend line just below. Identical set up on EJ the 1hr 123 would have given 30 pips.

Thanks for all your chart postings Dee, learning so much from them especially with all the notes you put in there.  
Did some reading regarding the Fibs you mentioned in post 1457, very interesting to see just how price reacts to these levels. I need to get the hang of it.  
Never used Fibs before, so thank you for the suggestion.  
BTW I took your 123RH indi off some charts and I can now see the 123 patterns![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) without it.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

If you can not live with out the alert, then use the alert editor built into MT4, you can have as many instances as you wish. I have already covered this here.

> Thanks for all your chart postings Dee, learning so much from them especially with all the notes you put in there. Did some reading regarding the Fibs you mentioned in post 1457, very interesting to see just how price reacts to these levels. I need to get the hang of it. Never used Fibs before, so thank you for the suggestion. BTW I took your 123RH indi off some charts and I can now see the 123 patterns![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) without it.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) Thank you.

![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)Congrats that you can now see the 123s with the naked eye. The 123RH indi is useful when first learning the pattern, but it is a bit over reactive. The naked eye distinguishes the good 123s far more accurately than the indicator.

ES +12 +20 +24. Pull the Rabbit out of the Hat Entries. What looked like a straight forward enter and run turned into a scrappy Will We Wont We. First entry was a Pin Bar off S&R and TL but price came back and tested my resolve, this produced a good reversal bar so I loaded up another entry, thinking "aha this looks promising" 30 minutes later I was closing the trades as a failed bar higher was followed by a red. This pulled all the way back past my initial entries to form a 123 with a DBL Bottom at short term S&R followed by a Bearish Engulfing. I loaded another one up for a 123 TTE entry this one ran up formed a minor 123 to confirm and then went to TP, by now I was exhausted, this had been a much harder fight than normal for the ES so I just kissed my wife and rolled over and went to sleep, this time I had the headache. Check out the signals on the Stochs and TDI

FOMC +82 +23. And they call us the "Dumb Money". Just look at the PA for 1 hour, we the retail traders do not have enough money to move price so all of that was the Big Money, the people who are supposed to know better than us. All you had to do was wait and read the minutes, that made it pretty obvious which way the Dollar was going, then wait for the Chicken Run to end and PA to confirm the way. It really is not that difficult!!  
  
It is summer, we have temperatures of 30 degrees centigrade, I am spending time in my market garden tending my vegetables and bathing in the pool, so I will post if I have some thing of interest, other than that Have a good summer.

Hi@,  
greetings from Germany. Love this thread.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)   
Seems I`ve discovered my final trading strategy by using a mix of Dee50`s approach and PhAnti (link Dee50 posted somewhere here).  
Having a fultime job besides trading I choose the daily and H4 TF. My first trade using these strats see below. Missed anything?  
Have a very nice weekend and concerning football world championship: Germany will certainly win its 2. game too! 

Have a nice day

I would have checked the 4 hr first. The Stochs failed to complete the downward cycle twice indicating upwards momentum, also, there is an ascending TL. In principle your interpretation was correct but I would either have entered earlier on a pullback back up the Pin of the Pin Bar. Price will often pullback upto 50% of the Pin Bar providing an earlier entry, or I would have used the 4 hr chart which had a 123 formation, although I understand your work commitments may have hindered that entry

Thanks very much, Dee, for your quick and as always established and informative answer. Never thought, that a deeper TF maybe more important than the higher one.  
But, as I traded the daily TF, my target is 1.3486 (instead of 1.3524). Hence, in this case, it equalizes the later entry, doesn`t it?  
Yes you are right, work commitments have hindered that entry. Although I am not sure having entered at the pin bar. Especially the bar had not touched the above supply area. Hence for me the BEOP was the confirming pattern to jump into, must still learn to get more confidence....![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1).  
Its so amazing having an experienced trader here who is prepared to comment any chart posted by newbies!![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60e.png?v=15.1)

As I am ambitious to learn, may I deepen the subject? I studied your last trade on eurusd today. There was a pinbar and Div(red arrow), followed by a strong bearish candle. Your entry was at the open of the following candle (green arrow). Why? It`s nearly the same situation as discussed before. Where is the difference, what do I miss?  
Thanks in advance.

Saw this and took trade too, same reasoning ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)but my micromanaging saw me exiting far, far too early despite setting a target for bottom of channel ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f62d.png?v=15.1) My entries are getting better; just need to trust analysis for profit target. My last trade of the day with gold actually saw both targets hit - probably because I had to leave my desk for a few hours!!

My apologies. I rushed to respond to you yesterday and did not look at your chart properly, if i had done so I would have told you that there was no divergence, also please check your Stochastic setting as per the attached chart, I noticed afterwards that your stochastics looked different to mine.  
  
Divergence occurs at swing points on the Indicator, the exception is when you get an over sized bar due to news which can result in 2 consecutive divergences as per the attached chart.

Your entry was at the open of the following candle (green arrow). Why? It`s nearly the same situation as discussed before. Where is the difference, what do I miss? Thanks in advance. {image}

What you missed was that I was still in bed at the close of the Pin Bar. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1) I trade 9.0am - 5.0pm CET more or less, usually, less.

Hi Dee  
Thanks for the chart postings. I notice that you took a trade on the 1HR TF instead of dropping down to your 15M chart and the entry was much quicker on the 1HR TF.  
I hope I read and understood your notes properly![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)  
I never thought you will ever get exhausted from trading![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) and as for the headache, well that's from exhaustion...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

I drop down a TF to see if I can get a better entry with lower risk, in this instance because the Pin Bar had formed and closed an hour earlier I wanted to see the PA on the 15 min, a little more detail, to confirm if the entry on the 1hr was a reasonable risk or not.

I rushed to respond to you yesterday and did not look at your chart properly, if i had done so I would have told you that there was no divergence, also please check your Stochastic setting as per the attached chart, I noticed afterwards that your stochastics looked different to mine. Divergence occurs at swing points on the Indicator, the exception is when you get an over sized bar due to news which can result in 2 consecutive divergences as per the attached chart. {image}

Hi Dee,  
thanks for the hints. Would you please explain, why there is no div in the last up-move of prices, when price-field is set to close/close?

By the time you see this post you will be saying, "Thanks, but I have read the PDF you put together at the weekend and I know the answer now"  
  
But if you have not! here is a chart that shows various DIVERGENCES (hint). ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f937-200d-2642-fe0f.png?v=15.1)  
  
Understanding Divergence is Important. Why? Because Divergence is one of the few "Leading Indicators" available to a Trader.  
  
Here is a PDF from a Trader here on FF called "Jankone" he excelled in trading Pin Bars with Divergence albeit on a lower TF.

I am convinced that many traders lose because they do not fully understand how to use the tools of their trade, they pick up a method or system and do not understand the component parts.  
  
If you are going to trade Pin Bars as part of your PA trading Method, then you need to understand what makes a Good Pin Bar, because not all Pin Bars are equal (also referred to as Reversal bars). So adding to the Jankone Charts PDF in the last post here are 2 PDFs explaining Pin Bars.

Profitable day but exit still needs a lot of work.  
  
EU +7. Had +20 at one stage but when TDI crossed back up, exited.   
EJ + 12. Again, had just over 20 pips; exited when price crossed back up.   
Crude Oil: +40  
  
EU and EJ exited a little too late and Crude Oil far too early. Still at least a positive day.   
  
Any suggestions on improving my exits much appreciated.

EU +23 Ongoing. 123 + TL Breakout Entry supported by Hidden Divergence off S&R & Rising TL & Btm of Rising Channel. 2nd Entry was a BPC. SL BE +5. See what happens. Possible Divergence forming at the moment but I am going to wait and see.

EU was a 20 pip trade right from the start, you should either not have taken the trade or you should have taken scalp profit at the rising TL which was also S&R and the 50% Retr. The EU had set up a Triangle you should have been looking for a Breakout or as I said, a scalp within the Triangle.  
EJ you entered far too late as you already accepted . You had a small Pin Bar off Falling TL PA had been tracking the TL down. A 123 with the Pin Bar forming the 3 point. TDI and Stochs showing downward momentum, again EJ had formed a Triangle and the 123 was part of the Breakout.  
  
If you zoom out you would see all of this clearly. There is no benefit to zooming into a chart, unless you need glasses, you only see part of the picture. look at the chart attached you can see much more when you keep it zoomed out.  
  
As for getting better exits.  
1\. Plan your Trade. Map out what you think price will do and plan your exits accordingly. See chart.  
2\. Take Partial Profits, so if you have got it wrong you have at least banked some pips.  
3\. Move SL to B/E as soon as you can, this takes away the fear of losing which is the main cause of closing out a trade to soon, yes you can be taken out more often, but, you can always enter again. I do not have losses I have Break evens. I no longer kick myself for getting taken out of a trade because I know there will always be another one.  
4\. Pick your trades, This is part of number 1. You do not have to be in the market all the time to win. This requires patience and discipline.  
  
EDIT. Forgot to add. I am not telling you off! On the contrary. Yesterday you made a very nice profit so do not let me or any one else put you down. You had no losses you exited before that could happen. Well done.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)

The first two days of this week have been good , since I have been away..enjoying a busy summer.  
Nice consolidation breakout setup on eaud H1 in agreement with TDI and 123.   
In fact I couldn't wait it up, I set pending orders which was filled as I expected, and hit set targets .

Thank you very much Dee. Your time and genuine support is greatly appreciated. Any profit I've been making recently have been mainly down to learning from you. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f973.png?v=15.1)

EU +45 GDP News. I entered once price had got down to 1.3600 which was an hour before news and TP was at 1.3650. just kept it simple and realistic. This was only GDP, normally good for about 30 - 50 pips no more.  
  
UJ +25 GDP News. Exactly the same thing, but I have closed this out before the BRN @101.50 because the Big Boys are starting to Buy back in.  
  
I am done. 70 pips is enough, I do not care if the market moves another 100 pips (highly unlikely).

Brilliant trades as usual Dee. I'd just like to ask you about your EU trade though: What gave you the confidence to go long at 1.3600. Yes, we were in a rising channel but news was coming and green below red on the H1. Price barely made 1.65 before turning round again. Was it just on the strength of the channel and BRN?

EU +26 +50. 123. EJ +36 +64 123. Straight forward 123 entries. Absolute No Brainers today. 4Hr chart confirmed the entries.  
EU. If you missed the 1st entry there was a 123 and then a BPC at the trend line then another 123.  
EJ gave you another bite with a second 123.  
  
News was as expected so nothing to halt the Euro drop.

Nothing clever. All the experts were forecasting GDP of -2.9% so really it was already priced in which is why I did not expect a big move and why I was confident that an entry at 1.3600 would yield a profit. I was ready to exit if price went below 1.3600, so I was only risking 7 pips. TDI MBL was tracking the 50 line and Stochs had turned at the 50 so nothing indicated any down ward momentum, so the only thing that was going to give some direction was the news. The big boys would have pushed it up to the BRN anyway to collect some stops.

EU +51 123 Entry. 4Hr & 1hr 123 @ S&R. Taken all day, most of the move up in the last hour, so the temptation to micro manage and close the trade earlier for considerably less pips was quite strong, fortunately I was distracted by my neighbours wife sun bathing naked, all right, all right I know my nearest neighbour is 600 meters away but thank god for Bushnell binoculars![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

Couple of trades for me last night and this morning in NY.  
EA h1 came close to my 22 pip sl, my entry was a bit too early, based on H4  
lower channel trendline, H1 tdi yellow mbl trending upwards, 123s, and consolidation.  
EU, trading with h1 trend, 123s, close above PWH.  
I'll be out for the rest of the summer. Good luck to you all, and enjoy the summer.

AU +40. 123 entry. Perfect 123. breakout @BRN then the pullback to short term S&R then the continuation past the BRN. This was the only pair with a clean setup. The EJ also had a 123 formed just below a BRN, but with the EU flat I left this one alone. TP was up at the 200% & S&R but price showed no inclination to go up there at the moment, being the AU it will do it in the early hours (asian session), I am a day trader so I have closed manually, 40 is enough.

EU NFP +55 +B/E +35. I have taken some contracts off at +55, because of the 4th July holiday I am not sure that it will go any lower than the BRN today. WOW! WTF. I am using the MT4 trailing stop and price in theory should have stopped me out, but the trailing stop just set itself back to B/E +22, what sort of a Trailing Stop is that?

When it comes to watching paint dry I would much rather sit outside and watch it dry on a wall I have just painted than sit inside watching it dry on a chart, so I have moved up to the 4hr chart and am swing trading, in other words I am letting my trades run until they hit my TP, in this instance it took 2 days to achieve what would ordinarily take 1.

i have one question, is anyone using the "[123Alarms.mq4](http://www.forexfactory.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=850160&d=1323199373)" found on this thread "[http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...58#post5199458](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5199458#post5199458)"  
  
i try attaching to my charts but then my mt5 platform freezes and i have to "Ctrl+Alt+Delete" and kill the terminal  
  
am i maybe copying it into the wrong folder (ie it should be in the "Experts Advisers" instead of the "Indicator" folder where it is)  
  
anyone with any advise on how to fix this please help  
  
thanks

A couple more for luck. EU +30. EJ +25. I had a Pending order on EU which the News Spike filled, lucky! EJ I entered short earlier on a pullback to the BRN, SL just above BRN only a couple of pips, so if the news went against me I would not have lost much.

Hi Dee50I happen to come across this thread by accident but found your post to be very educational. I typically trade Ichimoku but wanted to give what i learned from your posts a try. Hope you dont mind looking over the trade i did today. The attached chart is of a trade i took this morning. Its on GBP/JPY 15min to the short side. I drew yellow lines of the divergence i saw with the candles and Stoch. The second trade (a buy) was one i did not enter but wanted to see if i was reading the chart right. I have read over all the PDF's you have posted but reading and then applying are two different things. I hope to post more charts as i learn this method. You can ignore the OBV and the colored boxes on the chart. Thanks

I have marked up your chart. Your Divergences are "not" divergences, however you would have been right to take the long as it was supported by divergence.

Dee50, thank you for taking the time to give feedback. I will go back and restudy divergence again and if you dont mind i will post some more charts each day on trades i take using it. Please bear with me as i am sure a few charts will be obviously wrong. Thanks

Joe Dinapoli's said: "Don't use an Oscillator to price divergence as an entry technique, unless you have an excellent means of filtering it. Even for the best of Oscillators this can, and often does, spell disaster, particularly for the new participant. Price and Oscillator divergences abound, and the market continues to stop out the divergence players. Looking back in time, you're sure to find divergences that work, but when you're going forward in time, as in real trading, the accuracy of this technique just isn't there." ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

So are you saying, or rather Mr Dinapoli, that what I have been doing for the last 10 years is actually misguided? and that all the divergences I have ever traded have only been successful due to other circumstances?

Sorry, I did not know such Dinapoli, but ... what do you think/say/know?  
  
Clearly and sayed not enough to find the divergences, as discussed in **several occasions** dee50: IS NOT EASY and years of experience are needed. Nobody in their right mind would think that with ONLY divergences, going to become a Master as dee50, that is absurd and laziness. I think divergences can be a useful TOOL.  
  
Only my view  
  
Regards 

Newbie trader

No offence taken.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
I actually agree with the first sentence of Mr Dinapoli's statement "Don't use an Oscillator to price divergence as an entry technique, unless you have an excellent means of filtering it." The rest of the statement is unqualified, unproven hogwash designed to frighten rather than inform, which is a habit of many of the trading Demi Gods!  
  
For those of you who would like to know more about Mr Dinapoli here is a link to a gentleman by the name of Sive Morton who has provided an analysis using Mr Dinapoli's method, for some years.  
  
[http://www.forexpeacearmy.com/forex-...rten-analysis/](http://www.forexpeacearmy.com/forex-forum/sive-morten-analysis/)  
  
If you scroll down to one of the Daily Analysis videos you will see the Dinapoli method explained.

EJ +55. Pin Bar entry @ S&R BRN. 2 charts today. 1hr & 4hr, I took the entry on the 15m chart after the fakey down which gave me an earlier entry. Divergence on the 4 hr chart and a 1 hr Pin Bar @ the BRN convinced me.

Hi Dee50 - Good entry. When i was looking over your charts you always seem to nail the entry for lowest low or highest high when you place the order. Do you start at 4hr and then work your way down on time for entry? I dont have any charts to share today, i am only trading G/J and did not seen any entries on the 15 min.

My main trading TF is the 1Hr I check the TF either side (4hr & 15m) before taking a trade.

can undersand your thought behind this chart  
  
1，EU,from 8 may to 30 may,you always trading short,in this time eu have bouce and have too much divergece，some of them is mutiple  
timeframe divergece,and i think it is reliable，but you ignore that until 30 may,can you expalain the reason why you don't buy in this time  
  
2，from the chart you posted,i see you use the divergece a lot,you sell and shot on S&R,usualy divergece+123,i try to duplicate it,and meet   
some problems,i think becasue my S&R is no reliable,so can you give some advice on the S&R,i already stuty the article you recommand,but  
i think in you mind,may have some Priority in the SR,may be hi&low of hour/day/week/,or may be hi&low hour/day/week+fibo or something

The attached 1Hr chart hopefully makes it obvious why I took only short trades. The 2nd 15m chart shows why I went long on the 30th May. That should be obvious also. Here is the post that went with it.  
[http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...40#post7503040](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=7503040#post7503040)  
  
My working day is 9.00 till 5.00, so if a divergence forms at 2.00am I will be in bed asleep. The problem with looking at charts is that they are 24hr, we on the other hand are not, so when back testing you should "always" keep this in mind. Try to look at the market in your time frame this way you will have a more realistic expectation of what you can achieve.   
  
I tried to explain my method of drawing S&R lines here. [http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...27#post7457327](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=7457327#post7457327)  
  
All I can add to that is, I look at the open/close of the candles more than I do the High/Low. The best way to see this is to look at one of my charts, make a note of the Price at which I have drawn a level, put it on one of your charts and then follow it left noting where Price makes contact with the Level, also look at a HTF & LTF, Repeat for other levels until you get the idea, after that it is only time until your eyes see the levels easily.  
  
Hope it helps.  
  
PS. I am still on Holiday so forgive me if I do not reply promptly.

Danske Technical Update. Are you "really" making the most of the info that these Pro Analysts are providing or are you just interested in the Buy Sell signals that they show on the left of the Update? If the latter, "WHY". There is a lot of useful info on their Update, I have marked some areas of particular interest, I have also transcribed the info onto a Daily chart to give a pictorial representation of the info. Why are their Support and Resistance levels marked in different colours? Can you see? What is it that the Pro is seeing? you can not tell just by looking at their Technical update!

Good day and thank you for the great thread Dee50,  
  
i have asked one question in the "High Impact News System" thread but nobody answered me. The question was about your way of trading news using "sentiment".  
Please, could you answer here![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f64f.png?v=15.1)  
  
"some of you guys using word "sentiment" as a filter in news trading. Please can you explain what is sentiment and how do you use it as a filter in news trading. Is sentiment=news forecast or it's a major trend of a currency pair? And where do you look sentiment?"  
  
[Quoting Ken A](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=7618085#post7618085)  
{quote} Yes, at the least you will need to have plan what the data release will be to go into the _**direction of the general sentiment**_ not go against it.  
[Quoting dee50](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=7599111#post7599111)  
Interesting approach. I have been trading news for 10 years and have never noticed the candles 2 min before, thanks for that![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1). I use _**"Sentiment" as a filter**_.

EU. ECB Int Rate + Draghi Conference. +25 +10 +10. First entry was a "sentiment Entry" prior to the announcement, no change expected in Int Rate = Euro Negative, but the market did not react so I left it running until the Draghi conference this took price down to my TP for +25. next 2 trades were scalps following comments, using the momentum created by buyers coming in looking for the stops at 1.3390 and the prior sellers getting out. News Conferences are notoriously difficult to trade and are best left alone unless you understand the effects that the rhetoric create in the market. Trade the news conferences after the event not during.

I do not have the time to explain News Sentiment today, it is not a simple thing to explain, so I will try and find something that will explain it to you. News Sentiment is not the same thing as Trader Sentiment, Market Sentiment etc those things can be measured by Moving Averages, the VIX, Traders Sentiment Index an example of which can be found here on the Homepage of FF. I will try and explain, but just not today, sorry.

EU. ECB continuation trade. +20. +ongoing. I took another quick trade for 20 pips and have one still running with SL at B/E +5 Stochs and TDI are both at OS so I may close this manually if it does not get down to my TP in the next 30 mins. I try to make the most of momentum, we do not have it very often these days, so when the ECB cash cow comes along I like to milk it for all its worth. Yes the 1hr Stochs and TDI are at OS as well, so may be time to call it a day.

Perfect example of Broker manipulation. EU broker spread normally 1.7 pips, took out my SL 5 pips away. I went on deck for a ciggie and when I came back I just saw my SL disappear. See how my SL is hanging in mid air, Looks like the broker said "he has had enough money from us, lets take him out". This shit has never happened to me on Futures Trading.

honestly I've seen no one dare to trade Dragi's show, still you had a nice trade for today, if your broker had 10 traders like you , I bet that he is going to be out of business in no time....

Trading the News with Sentiment. Start with these 2 links, have a look through these 2 sites you should get an idea of what is involved in analysing the news to provide you with the Sentiment for each announcement.  
This is at least a starting point.  
  
When I have found something more I will post it for you, the difficulty is, that determining Sentiment is highly subjective and depends on the level of experience of the analyst. Kathy and Boris have been doing this for some time and even have an Asset Management division based around News Trading so it is fair to say that they have developed a fairly reliable model on which to base their assessments.  
  
Hope it helps, for now.

EU so far. +50. & News +30. First trade a "Hope this will go up Trade" off strong support level news took price upto TP. 2nd trade was Retail sales. Had a limit order that was slipped a few pips so I ended up a bit higher than I would have liked but the Euro was looking for an excuse and did not disappoint, first Tp hit for +30. SL at B/E +15 just below the BRN 1.3400, see if it holds.

Update news trade. Closed manually for +20 before my SL would have been hit. Logically, my 2nd TP was only 10 pips away from my 1st TP, my SL was 16pips below my 1st TP, seemed silly to give back 16 pips and anyway a look down the Barmaids Blouse on the 5m Stochs said time to leave.

EU +32 +54. Absolute exact same trade as yesterday, except today I have marked up the chart and I set a more realistic TP based on the channel top that was clearly acting as resistance which I failed to pick up on yesterday. Entry was classic Trendline Bounce with strong Divergence at a BRN, it really does not get more straight forward than this. What you have to try to avoid is getting sucked into what everyone else is saying and just be guided by what PA is telling you, for example at the moment the world and his dog is saying go short but the HTFs are showing a 4hr Range and Daily consolidation so what is wrong with going long under these conditions you are hardly trading Counter Trend! and by the size of some of these Bull candles the Big Boys agree with me, or vice versa.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

EU +31 +21 +23. Triangle Trading. 1st trade placed Fri evening, 2nd trade Sunday evening & 3rd trade this morning, TP finally hit this afternoon. I could have looked at 20 pairs to see if any thing better had set up, but I am basically lazy, the EU triangle was a sure thing, slow slow slow slow, but sure, so why stress by looking for trouble else where, the top and bottom were clearly identified so I knew exactly where price was going to go.

You need to ask this question on the TMS thread, they are actively trading the 4hr TF and would be able to give you a better answer, I have no experience of TDI trading on the 4hr TF. Just the thought of it gives me the shivers and makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f922.png?v=15.1)

This is what I am seeing at the moment. Do I close now or hold on and see if price makes it down to the Major S&R level @1.3295. Problem is it is currently stuck at this intermediate S&R level which is also the channel Bottom. Divergence has formed, but not what I consider strong divergence. For price to get down to the BRN would give us a session range of 55 pips, based on the last few days that is possible, but we have no more News to push it down. So as usual in trading we have a number of competing factors.  
  
What would you do?

EU + 27 +30. I agree, and I think your reason for stating that, is that the TDI is at a support level and that when scrolling back each time the TDI has come to this support level price has bounced back up combined with a longer period Divergence, and, that both the Stochs and the TDI on the 4hr and Daily charts are well into the OS level. Before you tell me, I am aware that once the oscillators are in OS zone price can continue down for some time, but Stochs has been OS for most of the day so it is likely that there will be a pullback, so if I move my SL down i would likely be taken out for +15 but if I close now I get +30 if I hold on to the trade and it does not retrace, I would get +39.  
So if I close now I get +30, If I hold on I might get +39 but if my SL gets hit I get +15 a difference of 15 pips loss against a potential gain of 9pips.  
Is that what you are saying?

Yellen EU +21 +44. What was she going to say that was any different to the FOMC minutes?? as it turned out, Nothing!! Only one direction for the EU under those circumstances, just waited for the spike to reverse on the 1 minute then entered in the area for a 1hr 123, took 1st TP at S&R, price did bounce here as expected, my 2nd TP was down at the BRN 1.3200 but I closed this manually just below the Daily 61.8% Fib Retr, the 1hr candle did close back above this level. how did I know? I did not, just had a feeling, I have always said I am a discretionary trader, I could just as easily have been wrong, like the other day I ended up letting you all keep your pips, but I will get you another time, some one has to pay to maintain my life style.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

If you want me to spend "my time" helping you, then please do me the courtesy of reading the thread, I have already answered these questions. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44e.png?v=15.1)

Also, a little trick is to use a line chart to draw your initial S&R lines, can even be used to draw the channels.

Use these settings for the Fibo channel. Then just practice drawing the channels on previous charts, you will see if you are right or wrong quite quickly.

My main trading account is still with NT and Futures, I just opened a small account with MT4 so that the charts I posted made more sense to the traders here on FF. If you do decide to go over to NT I will post the indis for you.  
I have posted this link before, it is to a forum where the vast majority of traders use NT and where I get all of my NT indis from.  
[Big Mike's Trading Forum](https://www.bigmiketrading.com/)  
  
I have noticed that there are a few more NT traders here on FF, perhaps it is time to start a thread for those traders or at least a thread asking who does trade using NT to see if it would be worth while opening an NT users thread.

Thanks Dee, I went there on the forum on your previous recommendation searching for those indicators, but I felt lost, thanks again, I have been using Ninja Trader for almost a year now, and I am willing to take the plunge and buy this power platform  
  
I think its a good idea to open a supplement thread to this for those trading Ninja Trader, I use it because its much easier for Fibonacci tools, retracements , extension and projections in different colors which suit the way I trade, I use harmonic all the time, actually its my main thing beside TMS   
  
If you dont mind sharing which ever indis that can allow me to shift to ninja trader, ie TDI, LO - NYO session high low, Asian High low, Yesterday high low these are the main indis am looking for, the rest can be added later , I really appreciate all the help from you , thanks

Thanks Dee, now I can start the testing again and come up with a template, I have one with just normal canldes which I like more than APB candles, on Ninja Trader its more relaxing using Jap candles rather than ABP canles

eu +45 +47. couple of Reversal bar entries with good divergence at major S&R and Trend line. 4 Boxes Ticked = an entry. TP was next S&R and BRN but Divergence formed at the S&R so I closed 2nd entry manually. Also had a UJ short trying to use news momentum but that went no where so I closed for +2.

friday EU +30 +45. Take your pick entry. This trade finished so late, I ended up closing the 2nd part manually. There were so many reasons to take this trade, I have marked as many as I can on the chart. If you missed the first entry you had 2 bites of 123s on the 15min followed by a 123 on the 1hr followed by a Range Breakout.  
  
So if you did not take it, why not?? How much more confirmation or how many opportunities for entries do you need!!!

Hello Dee, I downloaded your template to see if I could learn a thing or two from your trades which I've always admired, I opened an [Ironfx](/brokers/ironfx "View IronFX Broker Profile") demo so that I could see exactly what you see. I put the template on and found a lot of your trades don't match up to your posts (the arrows etc are still on the template) and just wondering how that could happen? This is what I mean, this one I noticed from this post with the image of EU: [http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...75#post7621775](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=7621775#post7621775) whereas when I put the template on, if you hover over the arrow it gives the actual price it went in at and these are images of the entry arrow, trendline and close arrow, hovered over.

You will have to ask a Techy person. I do appear to have a problem that I was not aware of but it is no biggy as long as the terminal and statements show the right numbers, I am not at all bothered but thanks for bringing it to my attention. I checked my last trades and found the same thing. Hover the pointer over the arrow and it says I went short @ 1.31738, the terminal reveals what actually happened, that's good enough for me! Fortunately Spot Forex is not my main trading account, but to be fair, I think this is more to do with the very old laptop I have been using rather than MT4 or the broker it has not been able to cope, with lots of freezes and crashes particularly with MT4 since they changed things.

Yes its really odd, Ive never seen it happen before, perhaps have a word with [Ironfx](/brokers/ironfx "View IronFX Broker Profile") and ask them why its doing it.

NFP week so any trades before hand are likely to be optimistic, this one is no different.  
Backed up by some good solid signal confirmations, but still, I am wishing that I had not added a second lot when I did, price has hung around at the 3110-3115 level for a while now.  
If price does pull back too much I could close both lots and at least have a Breakeven day or I could just close now and call it a day with a small profit, or option 3 is let it turn into a swing trade.

What a Dick Head. If you had looked at this chart yesterday, would you have gone short? I did, why? Because I allowed myself to be sucked into the market hype instead of taking note of what the charts were telling me.  
Optimistic, I thought, Brain dead Hype Zombie is what I was. Fortunately I got out clean but more from luck than good judgement.

Waw.... so with all of your experience you still think that it's better to listen to the chart instead of any news or analyses ? right ?

Yes and No. Technical Analysis is often right and often wrong. Some News moves the market and other news does not. Sometimes the market moves with Sentiment and some times it does the opposite. The one thing you can be sure of is that if you wait the chart will show you which way the market is going to go. (Note to me)  
Best way I can answer is to show you what I ignored and what I got wrong.  
  
My biggest mistake was that I completely missed off the Major S&R level at 1.3115, I mark up a separate Daily chart with nothing on it and then copy the levels onto my 1Hr charts, some how I missed this level, carelessness, sloppiness what ever you want to call it. If I had seen this I would not have taken the first entry. I also missed that price had reached the 200% Exp of the Daily 123 that started 16 july, and that the 3rd leg down of the last 3 was much smaller than the previous 2 indicating a change in momentum and possibly direction. The SMI was deeply OS.

The real crime occurred on the 2nd entry. The 2nd entry was a complete and utter cock up, a 5yr old with only 1 day of instruction would not have taken that one! Take a look at these charts they show every thing

Draghi Does It Again. EU +71 +126 I entered an hour before the announcement as price broke thru the bottom of the triangle. I was prepared to risk a 15 pip SL against Draghi because of this, the expectation of a 10bps cut and a Dovish Draghi, along with all the bad news coming out of the euro zone there was only one way, Down. Danske's statement was a bit ambiguous but none the less confirmed what I was thinking.

> {quote} Yes and No. Technical Analysis is often right and often wrong. Some News moves the market and other news does not. Sometimes the market moves with Sentiment and some times it does the opposite. The one thing you can be sure of is that if you wait the chart will show you which way the market is going to go. (Note to me) Best way I can answer is to show you what I ignored and what I got wrong. My biggest mistake was that I completely missed off the Major S&R level at 1.3115, I mark up a separate Daily chart with nothing on it and then copy...

Take it easy on your self Dee.... you are still among the best traders who can kick the market in the **s.  
as you said waiting for the chart to show you the way is the most important thing and most of traders including me won't wait till that time and that's were losses come.  
Green pips to you .

Thanks for the vote of confidence, but I have to be hard on myself because there is no one else to kick me up the **s. It is when I get soft with myself that I make stupid mistakes. Every trade I make, win or lose gets analysed at the end of every day, I mark up the chart, highlite what I missed what I did not see, then the chart is saved and is placed in 1 of 2 folders. 1 folder is for the good charts where I did not miss any thing, that folder is quite small, folder no2 contains the charts where I missed stuff, this one is quite large it is this folder that I go thru on a daily basis reminding myself what I did not see and in the process re-training my eyes to see these things without having to think about it!  
This is the time that traders refer to as "Screen Time" not the hours spent watching the charts waiting for a trade.

Sorry I can not help you there. Danske, like many other Pro information sites release only a small proportion of the information they have, for free, and then randomly. I check their site daily and see if there is any thing new available the above mentioned report I found under "Forecasts". I do not know what their criteria is for "Registering" to gain full access, I suspect it will be a bit more than providing an e-mail address.

Sorry for taking so long to respond to you, had to attend a funeral later on Friday morning.  
  
I wish I could tell you that there is an easy way to interpret News prior to the announcement, but there is not. It is a bit like doing a Jigsaw, except some of the key pieces have been hidden and you have to find them first before being able to proceed.  
I am going to give some thought to this and see if I can organise the process I go through, enough so that I can write it down.  
  
In the mean time things like this report contribute to the process and are easily available.

It seems that this is a common thing between you and Phx62, now I'm totally convinced that documenting trades and reviewing them is important for any successful trader.  
Thanks for the tip Dee, I'll keep that in mind and try to apply it as much as I can......  
Have a nice week end.

Hi,  
  
I'am not sure, if OT is still around here and if there's still development of the 123PatternsV7 indicator? ... I like the indicator a lot, but there seems to be a bug in the beta version ... when I turn off the volume filter the indicator doesn't seem to refresh properly ... I would be very grateful if someone could give me a hint how that can be fixed  
  
TIA

Update on 2 trades. EU +50. UJ +155. UJ ran to TP in the early hours (asian session). EU I closed manually when a reversal Bar formed off a rising Trend Line at a BRN.

UJ +23 short. +10 Long. Points Make Prizes!! A couple of quickies on my Futures account, much better for scalping, no spread and virtually no slippage. The only thing is, the trade markers on NT are diabolical. OH. 6J is the futures I.D. for UJ except it is upside down, in futures it is JU, go figure![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f615.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/2753.png?v=15.1)

Second Part. You need to post this query on "Platform Tech" thread and see if one of the coders will have a look at the code for you because there are no coders here.

Looking around the threads here on FF I have not seen any one mention a trade based on the GAP FILL on GU, I did not take the trade, I was already committed financially, but surely one of you must have taken this if only for the 123 Entry which signalled the start of the move. For the TMS traders there was an excellent TDI entry. The obvious TP was the Gap Fill but you could have used any of the BRNs for +50 or +100, Previous day High for +72, Trailing stop for +35.

Ah Dee. Sad to see you go. Your posts have been illuminating and amazing. You've also shown how news trading can be very profitable, contrary to many commonly held views. Thank you for your numerous input - have learned lots.

Saw a possible 1-2-3 forming on EJ at top of channel. Let's see where this goes today.

Well, that didn't work out very well. In hindsight I should not have taken the trade as the TDI was at the 50 level, still at an identified support zone and a very strong move up from yesterday. I think I got the 1-2-3 pattern upside down!

Yep. Deffinitely got the 1-2-3 direction wrong. This set up looks more promising. Stochs also in agreement.

Hi there  
  
Mact4 what is the indicator that plot that small number over the rectangle, is it number of bar counter for a pattern. Can you please share your indicators and template.  
  
Does any one aware of an indicator that count the bars with options ; 1-from a certain previous bar or 2- previous trend reversal or 3- previous swing, till a recent bar and plot it over each swing for that time frame  
  
for example it could plot the number of bars on the top of every swing of zig or zag in an zigzag indicator.  
  
I found this <http://forum.mql4.com/62607> since i am not a programmer i did not understand their language and i did not know how to pull the parts together to come up with that indicator   
  
please help  
  
Thanks

I could but you know you van do it yourself, right?  
  
click on Dee50's name on any of his posts. This will bring you to his profile page. On the left, you will see his posts, from the post recent. Just follow the links.  
  
By the way, some one has compiled his posts into a pdf. Just click on the paperclip at the top of the page.   
  
  
Just a heads up: Renko uses offline charts. It can be confusing but just follow the setup instructions: Drammen has the setup details as his signature on all his posts!  
if this is your first time be patient and read through the thread; any questions you may have are likely already answered pervious ly on that thread.

Hi Rob,  
  
Sorry if i quoted a post years back, if only given 2 filtering, i would rather filter this way in terms of direction and timing:  
  
1\. if signal shows _long_ , only open long when price _above_ session open and _withing first half of the session_.  
2\. if signal shows _short_ , only open short when price _below_ session open and _within first half of the session_.  
  
look forward to such EA if available.

I downloaded all 123patterns indicators...since there is no consistency in naming latest version I have no clue which one is latest: many of them freeze MT4 and some doesn't show anything...  
  
Which version of 123patterns indicator is gratest and latest, working?  
Thnak you

> Saw a possible 1-2-3 forming on EJ at top of channel. Let's see where this goes today. {image} Well, that didn't work out very well. In hindsight I should not have taken the trade as the TDI was at the 50 level, still at an identified support zone and a very strong move up from yesterday. I think I got the 1-2-3 pattern upside down!

Hello,  
  
The indicator is just very good, however I noticed that sometimes I don't print the arrow. The arrow only appears when I update the template.

If not wrong, when I open the mt4 the indicator doesn't update along with the bars. If this is not normal, can you fix it, please?

Hi,  
I used your updated indicator with Zigzag. It is plotted normally but returned with error "Zero divide". Could you please guide if this is possible to be fixed?

Anyone interested in trying to get this thread going again?  
I'm using MT5, anyone recommend an indicator (free) which provides alerts for 123 pattern?
