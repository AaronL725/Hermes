Hi One and all  
(rules updated)  
  
This is a great system - the 1-2-3 - break system.  
I trade the eurusd on the 5 mins charts with 3 Ema 5,30,100.  
on other pairs I trade on the hour, 4 hour & day chart ( I trade mostly on the hour - and confirm with the day)  
  
The 30ema & 100ema act as trend & channel... and keep me trading on the right side (hopefully!?)  
ie green (30ema) over red (100ema) only in an up trend  
price cannot be between the green (30ema) over red (100ema), ever when I trade.  
price & the 5 ema (yellow) must be over or under the two Higher emas  
The 5ema acts like momentum and/or a bird dog - Again price MUST BE OVER the 5 ema in an up trend

But these are only the bit player the real deal is the 1.2.3 break

As all ways (in an up trend)  
The "100 fibb" (2 pips over) is the entery point  
The "0 Fibb" (2 pips below) is the SL  
***Target : the "400 fibb" (2 pips under) (4.236 fibb works great) RRR 3 to 1  
I do keep an eye out for the 50 & 100 points on the chart & will use them if they are close to fib as targets.  
  
I find on the 5 min chart you have lots of trades. You will have loss but I find I win well over 80%.  
  
Only trade then the 3 ema are stacked in the right other and price is in the right place to them.  
best if you have some angle on the 30 & 100 ema & its great if they are pulling a part  
ie. the 30ema is running away from the 100 ema  
*** its best when the 5 ema is coming of the channel from between the two.  
( see blue box below this is great set up)

trade when you have volume & trust the "fibbs" they work  
it is really best to set and forget & leave the room and let price wonder to your target  
  
I use the Fractals to help with the 1.2.3 set-ups but you don't need them  
  
  
its that simple

Blue boxes are the the moves   
The Yellow is the **consolidation** patterns,   
its a rest before the next move.   
80-90% you will see price move like this.  
  
Use the "fibbs" the same way as in the past post  
its easy money.

I did a lot, because, sad to say it was a very easy day to trade  
with what was happen in the USA.  
I don't think it was a normal day esp. not a normal Friday   
  
I traded all day right up to about 3:50pm when [Oanda](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile") changed their spreds.  
  
What system are you using please share   
  
Cheers

Hi Guys   
  
Here is an advance trade on this stsyem   
I sometimes use.  
  
I only use it when there is a very clear 1.2.3   
And a big big hump in price.   
  
I get in on the break of the organge line 4a  
you get more pips the waiting for 4b  
(the bigger the hump the more the pips)   
but you will have more losses as well...but you are also closer to the SL.   
Again its two or three pips over & I am in.  
not the close of the candle   
  
The big hump is what makes it worth the risk

Not sure where you are. I assume you trade after London open. Is that correct ? (Or after NY open ?)

There was one last trade last night (I missed it)   
but it was a great hit on Target one  
& two pips on target two -- that is on the SL as price dropped.  
If you used the system.

You don't need it to trade with .  
  
I just like to keep an eye on the bigger trend that is all.   
I do feel better about trades if price is over/under the 3 MA on the 30 min chart  
the same way as the trade on the 5 mins chart  
And better still if they are stacked   
  
Of And I love it when we are in the 1.2.3 target range on the 30 min !!!  
trading on the 5 min!!

Hi Teb,  
  
Looks very good mate, am trying this out.  
  
  
I have come across a thingy tho - not sure if you've mentioned it or not.  
  
But say your looking to go long.  
  
You have a 1 and then a 2 and then the 3 is lower than the one.  
  
Is this a problem? Do you we still buy on the 2?  
  
I have attached a picture so you can see what I'm talking about  
  
Cheers,  
  
VB,

No never it has to be higher... in this case   
( if you are wanting price to go higher)

Hi Teb,  
  
Thank you for sharing your system.  
Could you please suggest settings of EMAs, Fibs, SL, and TP levels for higher TFs like 4H, D1, & W1?  
  
Thank you

Hi Teb,  
  
Thanks for these very nice illustrations, I've enjoyed studying them closely. One thing I was not clear on was your criteria for choosing which swing hi to swing lo (or vice versa) to draw the fib projection from, especially in an extended trending run. It seems like where your targets would be would very much be dependent upon the two end points you choose for the fib. Do you look for some criteria, like draw the fib (in an uptrend) from the first swing low after the cross of one of the EMAs? Or something else?   
Thx,  
R

Viatoris, the fractal indicator is available in the standard MT4 package. Choose the Indicator button to get the dropdown list and look under the Bill Williams collection. Regards, R.

Hi, TEB!  
I don t understand why don t You use the earlier fractal (high of the black bar) as Your point 2 on this picture (and 2 fractals earlier point 3, too). MAs looks good there, too? Am I missing something?

Hi Guys  
  
I could have   
The reason I didn't simply, I missed it   
I was not at looking at the charts when it hit.   
I got it the 2nd time around.   
  
  
All the MA are EMA closed  
  
Cheers

No you just about have it   
the targets are the 200% & 300% "fibbs"  
(of course they are not real fibbs)  
  
the fibs are in play when ever,   
But always with the trend   
but I will not get into a trade unless price is over the stacked EMA  
I hope you understand what I am saying

see the yellow box price breaks the "point 2"  
but see how the 3 MA are stacked in order?

200ema or 50 ema   
WSS (200ema) was an other thread I had going   
  
SL & TP I always use the same ones   
see the 1.2.3 ebook at the start of this thread  
as for other FIBBS I never use them  
I use the Fibb tool   
but use non fibbs 0,50,100,200,300,400

Hi TEB, The Fib is very important in this system as you have clearly stated, so what is the criteria for drawing the fib. I mean how do you determine the point to which you draw to get the fib level. Thanks. Nerry.

I missed the better trade in the yellow box   
but I got the second trade.  
  
But see how we are in a 1.12.3 on the 30min chart   
more powerful then just the 5 min chart

Hi TEB,  
  
Think EJ and EU had a strong TL on the 30 min?  
  
Do you think the stronger moves are when the 5+30 cross and cross back?  
  
Best regards  
  
Red

I don't really worry about crosses  
I am looking where price is to the 3 lines  
I will not buy if price is between the two bigger MA

Click on the fib line to bring up properties - then you can adjust the %'s to whatever you want.

Hallo - I have a question:   
  
Is that a good 1-2-3 setup? The problem for me is, that the lows in point 2 are on one line - there is not a higher low.

1\. 5ema is for Momentum on the 30 min & the 40ema for the 4 hour   
2\. 5,30 & 100ema on the 5 min must be stacked in order

1\. Is the 1st stop loss .. 4 pips below the 3 of the 1.2.3 system   
in fact I put it under the "00" that was close to the 3   
2\. Is the 1st target ...take 1/2 the pips & move up stop loss to 0+1 pip  
3\. I moved up my SL to the newer high low to lock in pips on the 2nd lot  
4\. 2nd Target... closed trade

I think its coming on all the charts ... is it stort turn or long term?  
  
But the 1st to turn in a big way, I think might be the Aud/Usd  
  
look at price to the RSI & the AO.

TEB, how to recognize the good swing of 123, is it the biggest movement of the swing? or any 123 pattern? and according to your experiences, in what condition the big moves will occur? is it at the news time?  
  
thanks

Once i applied your rules, and the trade unfolded as explained - it amaized me.  
  
The other thing I like about it, is that it could be a set and forget system - not that I am able to leave, YET - once i'm in a trade... LOL  
  
Could you tell me how the trading went with this system, before "Black October"?

1\. news I don't trade with this system  
2\. 1.2.3 patterns are set up by the ema  
you see what is happening   
if they are stacked & space between them   
there might be a good move  
but if they get tight there will be a good move also  
80% of the time the same way as the trend before

Hi Folks,  
I must commend TEB for this wonderful system. It has freally improved my earnings. I made $1200 today with it. However, I am finding it difficult putting the customized fibs of 100, 200, 300 on my chart. I know someone has tried to explain how to do it, but all my efforts so far has remained unsuccessful. Can someone please help me with this?  
Thanks

Adros  
  
Add the Fibs to the chart - right click or ctrl b and open the objects list  
  
Find the object 'fibo', click edit, then 'add' in level 1 which is equal to = 100% - so put 100% in the discription and keep adding for the levels you want. It should then stay as the default Fib setting for future use

hi, Teb!  
best and simplest explanation of using 123 & Fibo system   
  
why such MA settings - just from experience? what will be on higher TFs (hourly, daily)  
what you do with volumes?

the 5ema is almost the same as the normal momentun   
so on the 5 min we use 5 ema as the base   
we want the 30 min time frame which is 30 ema  
and we want a higher time frame say 2 hours 120 ema (some times I use 100ema)   
  
day is 5ema base, 20ema for a week, 80 ema for a month  
  
1 min is 5ema , 5 mins is 25 ema , 20mins is 100 ema   
(150ema would be 30 mins & 75ema would be 15 mins if you like them better)  
  
1 hour is 5ema, 4 hour is 20 ema ,day is 120ema (sometimes I use 100 ema)  
etc

Teb,  
  
Normally the spread is 2. Lately IBFX's [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") have been jumping all over the place - I'm really thinking about changing brokers. Thanks.

Hi Teb,  
  
Nice methodology! It reminds me somewhat of Bill Williams "Trading Chaos" approach to Fractal breakout trading, different moving averages of course, but similar in initail opening of a trade and subsequent add ons. Powerfull stuff. Thanks for the additional insights and your generosity of sharing.

Hi TEB  
  
Thanks for this trading method. I had a small winning trade this morning and it was the first winner in a long time. It helps with the confidence. I like your style a lot and it appeals to me. I notice that you trade on a demo. Do you only demo trade or have you used this method on live accounts? My win this morning was on a live account, yipee.

Hi TEB,  
  
First of all i would like to thank you on this amazing and powerful system. I have seen the 123 system long time back but i didn't care about it. In fact i was searching for such a reliable system for a long time and i think i have found it now. I'm going to demo trade until end of this year.  
  
Today i have taken three trades:  
  
GBP/USD ==> went long at 1.5812 and closed at 100% 1.5865 (+53 pips).  
  
AUD/USD ==> Long at 0.6770 TP 0.6824 (8 pips to reach target).  
  
USD/CAD ==> Gone short based on 1H chart.

nice trade   
  
but its not 1.2.3. trade its a break out trade which is great.   
Likely the 2nd best sign   
...esp. because it was the direction of the trend before.   
  
I think today would be a good day to sit out   
and let the markets deside what the new Pres. means to the future   
  
cheers

I sat out yesterday, cause the experts stated that the election day is normally choppy and low volume. What a day I missed, I saw x4 great trades....but only watching.  
  
Today the experts said that it would be high volume trading day, seems like they had their days mixed up.

I personally find the Fibbs I use better & simpler  
but if your work for you great.  
But it might get a little hard with two sets of fibbs running around the same thread.  
  
To win in the 4X you only need 1 set -up   
1\. A trend -- The 3 EMA  
2\. A tool -- The Fractals  
3\. A trigger -- 1.2.3 break  
4\. A target-- TEB Fibbs  
  
you are using a diff. set-up & that is likely ok  
but not the one I am using that is all.  
  
cheers

TEB, my Fibbs are the same as yours. They have just a little more lines ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1), which, I agree, are not necessary.

well it does look good doesn't it   
but really they are basically all the same system  
3 times frames one tool & 1.2.3 break   
there the 3 times frames are seen in the 3 EMA which is the tool  
  
that is all  
  
I am also keeping an eye on the one chart here mainly for the big "D" with the RSI  
that is the "little" diff on this system  
  
cheers

no I was using the "3" not the base line which is the "1"   
did I change that opps ...sorry..   
  
I might use either one in fact  
... in a tight market I always use the "3"  
in a wild market I sometimes use the "1"   
(I like to give it about 25-30 pips with the Eur)  
if "3" is to close... but I normally still move it up to "3"  
I hate losing pips  
  
I hope that makes sence   
  
cheers

Hi TEB,  
  
Not doing much trading with this yet but I like the format and am looking at possibilities. Have a couple of questions though.  
  
On the pdf you posted about 1-2-3's, the author clearly looks for major trend reversals with that pattern. With the 5 min chart that isn't going to happen but do you ever trade against the ema's? From what I have seen there are many more opportunities if you allow yourself to do so. Otherwise are you just using the 1-2-3 as an entry point into the trend defined by the ema's.  
  
Secondly, do you only use the swing points defined by the fractals as those valid for the 1-2-3 pattern? Again if you are more flexible there are many more.  
  
I'm not suggesting that you should make any changes but just trying to get an understanding of what you are looking at.  
  
Keep posting.  
  
G-Man

OK.THX, TEB!  
  
It lifts Your R:R, but push down Your hit rate...  
You think Your expectancy is better, now, or just psychologically easier to trade on this way?

I've spent the better part of the night reading this post. I've come to understand your system pretty intimately tonight and I am going to start using it. While reading I've put it up against a couple different trades and they've came out very well! I do have a couple of questions. Hopefully you can find the time to answer them.  
  
How long are you typically in a trade from start to finish with this system?  
  
Any estimates on success rate with this system?

I don't quite understand how you lost this trade and what you were saying here. Are you talking about your S/L here?  
  
Thanks a ton in advance,

5 = day   
25= week   
100 = month

>  On the pdf you posted about 1-2-3's, the author clearly looks for major trend reversals with that pattern. With the 5 min chart that isn't going to happen but do you ever trade against the ema's? From what I have seen there are many more opportunities if you allow yourself to do so. Otherwise are you just using the 1-2-3 as an entry point into the trend defined by the ema's.

1\. I always trade this system with the EMA  
2\. I use the fractals to help me but I pick the 1.2.3 points .. some times I use point (esp point "3"), that the Factals don't call  
3\. 1.2.3 is the main way I trade I will trade a good tri-angle break  
or a pen bar ( lost a trade last night with this)

Your 1st lot SL is at 0 - 2pips and your 2nd lot is at 0 + 2 pips, so you are only moving it up 3 pips correct?

interesting price is playing between the hour channel & the 200% fibb  
we have a battle going on to see which way price will go.  
  
I think this battle may be important for all the 4x

Hi TEB,  
  
it is a little bit difficult for me to see wich Hi and wich Lo you mark with your Fibo. (You can maybe use the dotted line of the Fibo to mark them)   
  
Is it important how long ago the different EMAs ordered each other in the right order ?  
  
I am beginnner, so do not wonder about my questions.

Yes they should be stacked in the right order. it is not important how long ago they were stacked. 5 minutes or 5h.. if they are stacked, they are stacked.... then its possible to enter a trade in the right direction...

ok yes   
but its better if the the yellow comes out from between the two   
if its been up a long time it may turn on you   
this is more of a problem on the higher TF  
  
be honest this is where the hour chart comes in   
to see what the longer term is doing.  
  
ie. channels or 1.2.3 or triangles etc. it   
  
cheers

once a month is non-farm pay roll on a friday am   
its a crazy thing but in the USA people  
have partys & bet on it they get hotel rooms & drink beers all night   
and try to win the lottery NFP  
  
anyways the big boys swing price both ways & then some   
so its crazy & I stay away from it because its the best place to lose a lot of money fast.  
  
as for trading times  
I do NY time I do & late London  
some times Asia  
  
1pm-7pm EST is about the worst time  
  
But its London not NY that runs the 4X   
so 3am - 5am est is the easist time to trade   
but its the middle of the night for me   
  
cheers

Gi day there Teb. Discovered your thread yesterday, read thru it & entered my first trade. A loser I`m afraid. Can you tell me if the entry was correct & just bad luck.

I entered 2 pips below the intraday low, 1.4787. Which is the 100% fib. I have been using these fibs on another type of trading but basically they are the same as Tebs. The T3 is 200%, T5 - 300%.

I think TEB prefers strong trends.   
The EMA40 is flat in M30. (not good)   
The price is not nicely under the EMA9 in M30.  
There is also the daylow wich is a resistence for your short.  
  
Lets see what TEB is saying after he woke up ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f630.png?v=15.1)

Tell me if I'm right here?   
  
On my M5 I have EMA's 5,30,100  
On an M30 do I need the same indicators?   
  
Currently am in a short of EUR/USD! Looks like I may have made the right trade! If so this system is awesome and it appears to be more accurate than other systems I've been testing.

How are you feeling about the trade? I'm not used to holding on to positions this long but I feel much more confident trading this system...which according to all laws...is a good thing!  
  
So 9 and 40 on 30 minutes? I'm still kind of lost on that and could use a little direction on that.

Do you mean 2 positions the same. If you do trade 2 lots then when you want to exit only 1 lot, just go to close order & select 1 lot only. This will close 1 lot & leave the other going.

Couldn't you just adjust your remaining position after you've closed the first one?

But the problem is that i have then to close my position manually. Sometimes that is really stressful, and you also have to sit there....

yes it was not a good day for this system the markets had no trend   
(a little at the start of theday & at the end)  
  
keep an eye on the eur/usd if its not trending likely nothing else will  
as that is where most of the money is.  
  
if this is the case you need to move to a Higher TF &/or higher EMA  
I moved to 200ema on the 4 hour/ hour/15 mins (WSS)  
  
also fridays are hard & mondays too  
  
monday morning people are setting the trend   
fridays afternoon people are taking money out   
  
A good times to loss money   
  
But anytime between 1pm & 7pm est is bad trading   
just too few people in the markets   
  
cheers

It is always the same question ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
The FIBlines 0 100 200 300 mean only that their distance is [equidistant](http://dict.leo.org/ende?lp=ende&p=thMx..&search=equidistant).  
You can edit the Fibos in MT4 under FIBO properties / Levels with right mousebutton.

Hi Guys,  
  
I've developed an indicator to visually identify the 123 setup . This is version 1 and it includes whatever is my understanding of TEB's methodologies.  
  
It draws a line between point 1 and point 2 and another line between point 2 and point 3 . Also draws the entry line. The lines alternate between DASH and SOLID so as to not confuse two consequetive setups.  
  
EDIT: Found an issue where some long 123 setups not displayed. fixed it.

looks fine... but put the 1 hour on as well   
  
put a 5 ems on it   
& look at the last hour candle and the one on now   
  
look at the RSI on the Hour make sure you are not over buy/sold  
or have the BIG "D" happening   
  
then put on the trade & your winning will be higher  
you don't need it but it helps.  
  
This is a great systen in a strong trend ... other wise you may get killed   
the market is not trending right now  
  
use the WWS I am   
  
  
cheers

1\. The white boxes show about the same area on both chart   
  
2\. The big black lines on the hour... you want going the same way... if not don't trade.  
  
3\. The RSI is not over bought/or sold   
  
4\. also as a conformation   
a.the rsi is raising  
b. Has punched over ther 50% .  
  
5\. it hard to tell here   
but you do want the candle & candle formations in the right way   
  
6\. price must be over the 5 (in fact it would)

WSS = World's Simplest System  
  
It's another one of Teb's systems that consists of three timeframes with the 200 ema

Yes I do have   
  
I am using the concept in the first post and 50 % of my trade I close using  
the fibo line and the balance 50% I go BE  
  
In the case of EU/AU trade I booked the contract before the closing of   
us seesion and frankly i let it run during the night.  
  
I enter for trade using EMA 5,EMA 30 and EMA 100 principle said in the first post  
  
If you have any suggestion pls let me know and I can take care more on   
my exit strategey etc

For this thread  
If you are trading   
1\. remember its friday  
2\. the Eur/usd is at a major fork in the road   
the 4 hour channel will break or hold   
either way it will have a major effect on the other currances .  
you might get blind sided on a 5 min chart ..  
even an hour might be small   
so keep your stops tight  
  
  
so it could be an interesting day with this system   
  
cheers

Here's one that just triggered on the eur/usd. The 4 hour trendline may be a problem as Teb pointed out. Thanks for the system Teb.<http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif>

I closed the rest out at 1.2616 due to the stalling at the 4 hour trendline. Thanks again Teb.  
  
Take care,

Hi harigp!  
I see you entered at 1.2455.  
Shouldn't you wait till PA was above EMA100 (considering 123break system, of course)?  
Your trade was much more profitable but I am not sure you followed the "rules"... ;-)  
Do you use an improved method?  
Thanks!

Hello TEB63 and others,  
  
Been trading this a bit...It's simple and is a no-lag system based on price action. Interesting for sure. I'm attaching a chart...Is this approximately how you guys would have played this pair.  
  
Am I correct to assume that the pullback should came at lease to the 50 fib?   
  
These 1-2-3 patterns are everywhere...how do you decide from the good and the not-so-good. Or should I read the thread from the start to get it.  
  
Cheers  
CanuckCT

hi CanuckCT  
  
Yes you should read the thread and the "World simplest system" thread from TEB63 from its beginning.  
  
The thing is of course the main trend of the upper timeframes. It should be in the same direction.  
  
How to know this look in the threads, or you simply can find a different method..... many things should be ok...

[quote=TEB63;2375696]That is trading its a # & % game  
  
Yes I know, but how to decide what is important and what not ?  
Do you remember all these things ?   
Or do you have a policy to say it is a trade or not ?  
  
On the first view your method has SL = Target1.  
  
For example for a long SL = 60 in GBPUSD:  
  
entry is 2 (break 123) + 4 (spread) and round number 40 away   
=> target1 = 40-6-4 = 30  
  
but SL is 60+2 = 62.  
  
That means that the target in average is much less then the stop.  
Is there any formular wich keeps you away from trading ?

but that true of only 1/2 my trade remembler I go for targer 2 as well   
so I am well over 1 to 1  
  
also I do move up the SL as soon as I can   
  
so again my wins are bigger then my loses  
  
  
I do use "00" numbers as SL & Targets & lows & highs as well.  
you have to see what is going on in the market   
move up one time frame & take a look   
do you have a lot of space at the top or are you close to it.  
if you are close ... a big choice will need to be made break or bounce  
right   
  
cheers

Hi   
  
I wrote a skript, it helps to post charts.   
  
Do the following:  
1 Install the skript.  
2 Make a hotkey with leftclick onto the skript  
3 Place a fibo onto the chart  
4 Rename the Fibo into "teb"  
5 click the hotkey to start the skript  
  
What you get:  
You will get the colored lines as in my last post.  
You can change the lines because of round numbers etc.  
You can read the places of Entry, Stop, Target1, Target2 for your orders.  
Others as well can read the values onto your screenshots....  
  
After you installed it like above its only:  
1 move the fibo  
2 press the hotkey  
3 fun

Hi,  
  
I have been on this thread for awhile. Now I am trading this method live.  
  
Is TEB still using this method or the WSS one?  
  
Which method do you think is better or rather, when to use this method as compared to WSS.

Hi,  
  
How will we know if there is a sudden change in the short term trend. When there is a 123 break on the 15 min which has broken the trend as dictated by 1h and 4h. But ended up as a failed trade and the 1h soon also breaks the EMA.  
  
I understand that you have said to look at the 4h candle. But what do you do if you encounter this situation? When you thought the 15min chart will go back to the trend but instead the 1h breaks the EMA.

Does the angle of the 200ema matter?  
  
Your chart has more than 1 ema, how do you use the other emas? thanks.

Hi,  
  
Eversince TEB said that he is using WSS more, this thread seems to be dead.   
  
I feel that this method is much safer than WSS. It has higher success rates for me. The WSS method is much harder. Because the price does not immediately re-cross the 200ema on the smaller TF. So it suffers high drawdowns at time.  
  
Correct me TEB, I am having difficulty with WSS. WSS may lead to a change of intermediate trend and as a result trades become losses. While this method works in strong trends. And we are only trading with the strong trends.

Hi Kris  
  
I am very glad it is working for you!!  
  
I find the WSS much safter .. less draw downs if done right  
this one I use only in a very strong trends!  
  
Its the set ups in the WSS that is so strong!  
  
cheers

Thanks for sharing this valuable info and method.I've been working hard to learn all I can and I think my brain got clogged up with all that info, lol. Now I'm looking at some simple methods and making good pips. Yesterday was a crazy day, I was up about 250 pips but got caught on a few bad 1's but closed the day out with a profit of 9 pips. Still I made a little and was happy to have that little bit. Could have been a lot worse.  
  
Hoping everyone makes happy pips and has a good time doing it

I never understand why threads on simple systems like this one never last long.  
  
I think its because those who know how to trade - trade something like this  
  
and those who do not know how to trade have 100000 tools on there charts!  
  
I get pips everyday with this system!!

Really? I use another system:  
  
It's a point system based on  
  
1\. The weekly, daily, 4 hour, 1 hour, 30min, 15 min and 5 min charts  
2\. I look at news, interest rates differences, cot, trend, swing, candles, how other markets are moving and a few other things.  
  
Hope that helps.

Thanks Teb, do not know how I missed this thread, must have been the full stops in the thread title, I searched for 123 so 1.2.3 did not show up.  
  
Nice 123 method to add to my arsenal of 123 methods. I did not follow your rules entirely, my apologies.  
  
First Trade. 123 short from strong resistance area 1.3550, my favorite 123, 2 lots, first target the 300 second target the 400 & BRN 1.3500, first target achieved moved stop to 200. Stopped out at 200.  
  
Second Trade. According to Teb´s rules. Safe first target the BRN 1.3500 & 200, last swing down did not reach the BRN so this time the BRN most likely target, second target the 300 at 1.3480. First target achieved moved stop to intermediate Fib 123.8%, the 161% fib was to close to the price. The Pin Bar off support BRN 1.3500 should have told me to close all but I held on, got stopped at 123.8%.

Thanks TEB for sharing this strategy. I'm a complete newbie and have been looking for something exactly like this: a simple system where the basic tools of trend identification, indicator use, Fibos and MM rules go together.  
  
There is always more to learn, but in my case, I feel it's high time to actually start executing a trading strategy. I'm bored of just playing around (and getting stopped out without a consistent strategy) and reading completely contradicting opinions in the trading threads. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

\--I'm a demo newbie, please be cautious.

Wowowoooo it worked great, I messed it up only that I did not know at first how to partially close an order (@200%), so I closed it all. Let this be my greatest concern.  
  
So the rules I use so far on M5:  
\- Trend: Alligator's teeth (3xEMA) in order, RSI-14 on the right side of 50, ADX-14>20  
\- Tool: At first, nothing, how do you exactly use Fractals?  
\- Trigger: 1-2-3  
\- Stop: under point 1, with 2% risk  
\- Target: close 50% at 200% (move SL to riskless), close rest at 350%  
  
What do you think? Is 2% reasonable, or do you use a different rule? 

\--I'm a demo newbie, please be cautious.

Hi Danc, I looked at your example at screen, and could not understand...in green boxes you show point 123 to enter. and the entry is followed by trend. But if we look to CCI, it is located in overbought zone and does not recommend to buy. Perhaps its possible to use the strategy without CCI?

This is virtually identicle to my own system that I completed just this year. I was looking for a simpler way to trade that avoided having to check multiple time frames, C.O.T data, news reports etc to make discretionary decisions on direction and entry but kept me on the right side of the move and trading when momentum is present. Wish I had just read this thread when you first posted it.  
  
I use a 2;1 reward/risk instead of your fib targets and longer periods for the ma's but the entry method is the same as are the rules about between the ma's.

GU(5min)...perhaps a tad contrived but willing to give the short a go, if triggered.

CJ short, may be the next one for me...could be in the process of rejecting both daily and weekly S1s...tgt likely to be the RN, will hold longer if there's sufficient momentum.

Dear, The idea to use 5 EMA getting out of the cloud of 30 EMA and 100 EMA as MOMENTUM is excellent. You are brilliant.

I did not trade these - but very clear trades on the eurcad  
2 trades  
purple lines - SL are the stops  
white lines - Entries (bars close over the green 30 ema then under the 5 ema)  
blue lines - 1st targets  
red 100 ema and 30 ema green - clearly down  
yellow ema - we see a clear retracement then break back down  
the RRR is a little small on both trades

Do you actively trade this system? I've always been a fan of 123s and Ross hooks but never could make it work for me.

Wow. TEB, I just have to say. I read this thread from top to bottom. And the fact that it is surviving till today is a huge testament!  
  
What you are doing is fantastic and I GREATLY respect you for that.  
  
I have been training for 3 years. But I blew out my account 4 times.  
  
I have been using this 123 method for the past 1 month and out of 30 trades, 23 were winners.  
I will keep working hard on this!  
  
Looking forward to more of your posting.  
  
Thanks once again TEB! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

First of all , Thank you TEB for a great system and clear/simple explanation . You are great ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
I will, try this strategy in this month ( all June ) on my live account ( opened specially for this system ) and will post right here the results ,along with pictures.  
  
I think ,that 123 have a great potential even after all these years .  
  
_Today's orders :_  
  
\- AUD/USD **\+ 15** Hit first TP ,then moved the rest of orders to the break even,hit BE  
\- USD/CHF **+9 / TP1 , +19 / TP2 , +29 / TP3**  
\- EUR/USD **\+ 5** I opened the order but after a few minutes close manually  
\- USD/CAD **\+ 19 / TP1 , +42 / TP2 , +59 / TP3**  
  
I am looking for a 123 setup on m5,then I go to the M30 and H1 ,to check the situation, where is the price,check the candles and some channels ,S/R, flags etc..  
  
Below some examples of today's entries / Central European Time  
  
Thank you TEB one more time ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1) wish to you all nice week

There are 2 Possibilities here:  
1\. The nested 123-Buy-Setup  
or  
2\. The Reverse 123-Sell-Setup

EMA: 5,30,100  
But they are not very important,  
they show the Trend Direction only....  
It is possible to trade without them

123-Reverse-Setup on M5  
It was a bit risky to sell this 123  
  
But M30 links has a great bearish PinBar,  
that shows great Downpressure  
  
Therefore I took this Sell  
but moved SL to BE

There are 2 Types of 123-Setups:  
  
1\. with Trends  
2\. Reverse Setups  
  
In this Fall I saw a Reverse........  
  
There are 2 great Threads here on FF about 123-Systems:  
  
1\. 1.2.3. break bacis: [https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...23-break-bacis](https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/106165-123-break-bacis)  
2\. How to use the 123 strategy effectively: [https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...gy-effectively](https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/232466-how-to-use-the-123-strategy-effectively)  
  
There are 21+85=106 Pages here  
I love this both Threads  
  
There you find all Information about this 2 Setups...  
  
IMHO:  
for me the best Stuff in FF
