Hi All,  
I am posting my no indicator intraday system for you to use as your own.  
I will go through the system from start to finish and when completed I will post live trades and answer any questions you have.  
The system is based on support and resistance of which I can use daily, 4hr, 1hr, 30m and 15m to establish a trade entry.  
I do not get it right everyday so no promises.  
  
All support and resistance is marked up / plotted on a line chart.

Lets look at some different time frames so you get the general idea.  
  
Plot horizontal lines on the most recent peaks and troughs.

Now change time frame to 4hr chart.

Adjust the lines so that the daily lines are on the 4hr peaks and trough  
  
The following chart shows the 4hr lines before adjustment to 30m.

Now do the same to the 30m chart so it looks like this.

I will get to 15m charts shortly.  
  
Notes on support and resistance.  
The support and resistance lines will not always line up perfectly, sometimes they will but most of the time not, you just have to work with what you have got, you need to be flexible.  
  
The next chart / charts I want to discuss is my trading screen. I have two charts open all the time, one is line SR and the other is a candlestick chart with recent SR lines added. If you do not have room on your screen for two charts you can set up a line chart and toggle between line and candles.

_Support and Resistance Lines_  
SR lines are basically a price where there is a strong change in belief has occurred of the market price / currency value.  
They are reaction / rejection points that we can use to our advantage.

We now have a support zone and rejection candles. Next we want to get into the trade and this you will find interesting.  
The majority of traders enter trades when everything lines up in their favor, I am talking moving averages, MA crossovers, MACD bullish etc.  
If you use this approach you will find it difficult to succeed with any trading system.  
I will explain....  
  
The following chart shows a textbook Close above MA type trade. The only problem is you are giving away way to much of your funds in the stoploss.

@Islandfx911  
You explained your objective ways of marking support/resistance  
Well done  
  
Can you please explain what the blue rectangle means in your system?   
How do you enter if you don't have nearby candle wick like that?

Have you ever thought with a right set of indicators you can see all the things you want to see on just 1 chart? instead of 4?  
  
Candlestick give you only 4 snapshots high, low, open, and close. And that’s it.  
  
Indicator is based on the range of the price history. It gives a lot more info on how the prices was compare to now.  
  
To me, although I have traded naked for a few years, trading without the indicator is like you try to swim with only 1 arm. Can you swim in the calm water with 1 arm? Yes, you probably will be able to and will do just fine. And yes I had a few impressive runs trading naked. But what about in a raging ocean with countless rogue wave? Are you well prepared for it? I learned my lessons and paid my price solidly depends on just the candles and price level. 

If u luv happiness, start w/ discomfort, make friends w/ pain and failure.

Are you smart share your system? If not will ever do it, make no sense to teach other to swim right? I think it is a good start here and trading can be done without an indicator. See in commercial section you will find someone who share it daily. 

Market is more simple as you think.

The MA chart I posted is used as an comparison. I do not use indicators. SR levels on my charts are how I see them. Thank you for your input.

Hi Merka,  
The rectangle is used to create a Support / Resistance zone to enter trades from.

Entering Trades.  
On this example, I wait until market open has determined direction, I have an established support zone and a rejection of that zone.  
There is enough information there for me to enter a buy position.

Stop loss and Targets.  
As with all trades I am looking to reduce the stop loss as soon as possible as long as it does not increase the risk of the trade.  
The SL is moved to break even on close of bullish candle shown on chart  
  
In regards to targets I always set a RR of 2.3:1 as a minimum. I started out with a 2:1RR however after three months of trading this way I calculated that 0.3 of the trade was taken up in commission / spread by my broker on each trade. This was eating into both my losing trades and profitable trades ($2300.00 in 3 months)  
  
Note: 2.3:1RR is a good return. I can get 5R and 6R on occasion however it pays not to be greedy.

AU this morning.  
My bias is bullish however there is resistance above that may push market further down to 4hr support. Just my view on what has been shown from earlier posts.  
Just a reminder this is not a signal service and nothing is for sale. Just trying to show an alternative way to look at and trade the market.  
Have a great day trading today.

Clearly, this is a premature entry.  
  
by “textbook” the shooting star candle pattern has yet completed there. **completed only on the next 3 candles. You were lucky that 3 candle completed changed the direction where I wouldn't be surprised AT ALL this price would continue go down after YOUR ENTRY.   
  
And too by “textbook”, your 4h support level line wasn't marked correctly either where it should be marked on the tip of the most recently visited candlesticks. You marked it in the middles of the sticks, 162.85.  
  
And 3 by “textbook”, the price action wasnt making higher highs although it was making lower lows, in other words, my friend, you were making entries against the 30 min trend.  
  
Now what is a recipe of disaste? Brutal honesty, think I see one here.

On this other hand, you posted a perfect example on how to properly read and execute on **an indicator triggered signal, bottom tested shooting start into a MA cross**.  
  
*Although I would still add just 1 or 2 more indicator to confirm this turnaround just because it was going against the main trend of the day on this 30 min chart.  
  
But just for this example you posted ignore everything else that was happening on other timeframe, just on this chart, it was perfect timing, perfect location, perfect run and perfect closing on the 2R spot (textbook, but I think I would still hold it a bit longer). Money shot (I would call it), the type shots that would yelid me 10 times flips in less than 10 trades, all triggered by the shooting star and ma cross.  
  
Am I not correct?  
  
This is the time when I tell people trading is supposed be easy when the proper indicators are lining up and screaming at you to take them home.

oh noooo… sorry I mean to say it felt really good when I get a good and easy trade like that, Like a lion locks it's jaws on it's prey that is still alive and kicking the type feels good. Apology for my language. Sometimes trading gets me frustrated and excited at the same time and I just don't have a pool of pretty words to describe it.

Hi All, Just posting this last reply as I is relevant for those who were interested in how I trade.  
  
''AU this morning.  
My bias is bullish however there is resistance above that may push market further down to 4hr support. Just my view on what has been shown from earlier posts.''  
1st trade where I mentioned I was looking for longs (Post24) was successful.

At thread starter, better set as fast as it make sense the clowns to ignore. In real life you can be better suit a conversation, but this work not out in web aswell. Only chance to keep the good start running is ignore them and keep in touch with ones who want follow here with suitable questions. I look some pages from now and prepare some questions if not all answered at that time. 

Market is more simple as you think.

A good strategy, but without indicators you need to constantly sit at the monitor and monitor the price movement, otherwise you will miss a lot of signals, it is unrealistically difficult.  
I think it's better to make an indicator that gives a signal.

Hi Eprst,  
I spend 1hr - 1.5hrs a day trading of which all is needed to trade this system. The Asian session starts for me at 8.00am and goes through to 9.30am after that my trading is finished for the session / sometimes the day. After 9.30am the market activity drops right off. The same occurs at Euro session and the US session. There are 1.5hrs of activity at each market open then it goes quiet unless there is Red news out.  
  
In regards to indicators.  
Lets start with a blank 1hr candlestick chart and you put a 21EMA on it, the market starts trading above the MA and your system says buy. You have just created a belief in your mind that the market will go up. You then add another indicator, the MACD and that confirms and reinforces your belief. So you are ready to go, you feel good, your brain is feeling good. You are about to press Buy and you think to yourself I will just check the higher time frames. When you do, the MACD is bullish however, the 21EMA is bearish.  
What happens next? Well, you question your analysis and start to have doubts about going long. Your bullish belief has just been destroyed.  
Even using lets say red and green candles is detrimental to trading because your brain is associating green with up and red with down, same deal, you change time frame and you get mixed signals.  
Indicators are based on price, what are we trading each day? Price. What I have done is eliminate / reduce positive and negative beliefs by removing indicators and colour from my charts.  
If you don't understand how to trade price no amount of indicators will help.  
I have placed three trades this week and netted 6% on a system that I offered to everyone only to have three traders telling me that I need to use indicators to make it work in the long term. Crazy!  
If someone had offer me a system that can produce 6% in two days for 4.5hrs work. I would be onto it as fast as I could.  
Trading is not about banging out trade after trade throughout the day. If you want to be successful all you need is one maybe two trades a day at the right risk / reward and then........ you can enjoy your life. 

Your trade order needs to be in the right place at the right time.

Hello Islandfx911!  
I didn't mean standard indicators.  
I wanted to say that you need to create an indicator based on your system that would give a signal to enter a trade.

Hi Eprst.  
Thanks for your input, I am just past using any form of indicator.  
I will assist though with the system rules if anyone is considering creating an indicator for their own use.

Instead of telling all that is wrong you can say how to make it right. You are very good trader there is not doubt about that.   
You mentoned that would use more indicators to confirm the trade you can start with that an not necessarily disclose your strategy

Hi Asw,  
This the template I use to store SR lines on. I am always updating it as I go and adjusting for 30m time frame.  
Hope it helps

The basis of the system is wait for an impulse move and pullback leading up to and during market opens.  
The rectangle is drawn first on the line chart and then copied across to a candlestick chart adjusting it to the candle close and wick.  
This will give you a SR zone. If a zone has been created it is because traders believe that the market price is to high or to low and a sharp reversal takes place.  
When I place trade I want to be close to the SR zone with a rejection wick visible.  
In the following chart there was a valid setup however the entry was to far away from zone and therefore poor RR.

Why you didn't trade this zone upward?  
From where I marked, clearly price was bouncing upward, hence the question.  
  
You mark your SR lines and zones → all good  
but how you choose the direction of your trades is not very clear.

This is the better type of entry. Price went back into the support zone and bounced back up. That is telling you everything you need to go long.  
You don't have to go long at close of the bar I marked (1) (The scared trader does this)  
Something else to bear in mind is the ADR. If you are buying on the close of thrust bars like (1) you have less room for your trade to travel to its TP.   
You have to use everything you can to improve your odds of success.

This entry make sense and the justification as well.  
Yes, it's necessary to figure out where to enter depending on the trader confidence.  
Please post on your next entries how you used the ADR to decide where/went to enter.

Hi Merka,  
  
Your red line on the chart is out of the high market activity times that I mentioned in post 43.  
  
**From Post 43.**  
**I spend 1hr - 1.5hrs a day trading of which all is needed to trade this system. The Asian session starts for me at 8.00am and goes through to 9.30am after that my trading is finished for the session / sometimes the day. After 9.30am the market activity drops right off. The same occurs at Euro session and the US session. There are 1.5hrs of activity at each market open then it goes quiet unless there is Red news out.**  
  
As you can see on the chart price went sideways after the low was taken out. So not valid to go long.  
Another reason why you would not trade this is because it is USD based trade.  
I only trade the following pairs during the Asian session.  
AU, EA, AJ, AC, EJ  
You want to be trading the correct pairs for the session.

Also the prior swing low had been taken out.

This is my trade from this morning. I new AUD CPI was due out at 3.30 (8.30am Local time)  
I had a valid support zone, price shot down and then back up closing above the support zone so I went long at....  
As you can see I moved SL to Break even +1 and was stopped out.

Hello island, I have some questions:

Why "for you asian session start at 8.00 am"? According to your statement asian session last 1h30m, which is not the case because it last from Tokyo open to Tokyo close, so why this arbitrary choice?  
  
Also on your pic you marked 01:00 GMT time as market open, but why 01:00?

If 09:30 is your end of asian session, hence 09:00 GMT time (close of Tokyo), then why you say the activity drops off when it's the exact opposite? When Asia close there's London and then US/Lonson, thee times are the peak activity of the day. Am I wrong or you're saying that before London session is when activity peak? Because that would be objectively wrong.

I dont understand why people attacked this strategy .Its a basic rule in trading "broken support becomes resistance" vice versa.

I would suggest to avoid giving much attention to the thread starter... Couple of days ago he made a post where he stated he's "available to teach anyone interested", then deleted the post shortly after. Probably just another fortune-seller, he's just waiting for some people to get interested.  
  
Wonder why FF still allow deletion/editing of posts.

Hi Oculus,  
I deleted the the post due to lack of interest. I offered to help people, that's all. I advised I was not selling anything and I was not posting trades as a signal service. I have always been a generous person throughout my life and I believe there is nothing better than helping someone along the way when you can. I don't see anywhere in my posts that indicated I was helping people for financial gain. I take it from your 3 posts you are Probably new to FF and yet you have found it important to label me as a scammer in such a short period of time. You really don't know me so please don't judge. Maybe in your time on FF you should take a second to consider that there are possibly some decent people out there willing to help others.  
All the best 

Your trade order needs to be in the right place at the right time.

Well, Islandfx, sorry to hear that someone regarded you as scammer.......Let's forget about naysayers.....My analysis for Gold for the following week.....Let's see whether it will break this 1H bracket C. If it breaks above....then I assume it will continue to climb further up otherwise it will drop back to the lower 1H bracket A for further confirmation. Will appreciate if anyone could put forward any further suggestions.....TQ.

Well well well... combing the support and resistance zones from the line graph is definitely going to be insane for me going forward.  
  
Sometimes I get confused where we are going to be heading to next and I have done for so many years at times... but by following the 4HR support and resistance lines it is going to send me to another level in my trading with my entry method.  
  
I basically trade orderblocks and I use a 0, 25, 50 and 100 fib levels on the last up or down candle before a strong move in the opposite direction as seen below.  
  
I set pending order trades on the 25% zone (Green Line) and then stop loss is the spread after the red (100% of fib levels - Yellow pen marks ive put)... i.e 0.5 pip. Take profit is the next zone (white lines).  
  
Just wait for the pullback and let it enter for you... - Note: its usually best when there is a break of structure or change of character.  
  
As you can see below, it is proving very fruitful if you took all these trades on EURUSD on 15m chart.  
  
Thank you for refreshing my mind by pointing out the line graph to create the zones!!!  
  
Found the entry method from someone on YT - (TFWP) but tweaked it a little.

I was going to post this here...but input in the thread I'm normally in..as some may not pertain to the OP thread..but definitely overlap... Line charts etc perhaps it may help someone here with some different views.

Hi Inthebox,  
Thanks for dropping by, I like your style of trading. Some great trades on your thread.  
At the time you posted the chart it was the Asian Session. During the Asian Session I only trade AUDUSD, EURAUD, AUDCAD, AUDJPY and EURJPY therefore I would not be looking to trade GU.  
I'll take a look at GU when the Euro Session starts today. 

Your trade order needs to be in the right place at the right time.

Hi, Island!   
I m curious, how do You manage Your trades, when You think there is more than Your 2.3x TP?

Hi LT, I use support and resistance extensively with my system for entry and TP. I use CaveManager to place the trade, set initial SL and a TP of 2.3R.  
**Trades don't always make it to TP though.**  
**I will always go to breakeven on the trade when I can.**  
  
So, trade is placed and underway, I then look to see where the key SR levels are to see if I can push out the trade.  
Factors that attribute to pushing the TP out.  
1\. The amount of S/R that I have traded away from.  
2\. Was the trade a from a Daily / 4hr inside bar breakout  
3\. Was the market confined to a tight range prior to trade entry  
4\. High impact news  
  
When I consider pushing the trade out I always keep telling myself "Don't be greedy" It is the best advise I can give you  
You can never think there is more because no one knows, you just have to place your trade as per your plan and attempt to be profitable with what the market gives you.  
You can only control the system rules. Have no expectation of what the market will or will not do. 

Your trade order needs to be in the right place at the right time.

Here is my trade from this morning. I was late getting in as I was away from desk. This is a trade that I pushed the TP out as described above. I was able to get 3.85RR even with the missed entry (Arrow) My TP was already know (4hr Support) shown on the line chart. I set TP just above the 4hr support line and you can see I got a great fill.

Seems You sold into the RBA rate announcement. Were You aware of that? I mean, You knew they left the rate, and was it on purpose? Or You neglected the content of news, and just used TA?

Hi LT,  
I always check for red news and factor that in to the trade. The system gave a sell signal, I know my risk so there is nothing to worry about.

I stopped using all indicators a few months back because I wanted to learn more about how the chart worked and where to place the trade without the use of an indicator... i am not always right but using a 75/25 win/loss ratio, it works, but I will be watching to see what you are doing. Good Job!

Hi Traders,  
As I have some time over the weekend I am going to post some charts of trades that were available this month. This will give you an idea into what to look for.  
On the charts I have put the time as per my terminal and also MT stands for max travel which is the maximum distance price traveled from trade entry. This will give you an idea of how far you can push the TP R out.  
I will be posting mainly 30m and 15m Impulse / Pullback Entry Charts. I am posting blue red candles as you will find it easier to identify the rejection candles.  
I always start with line chart analysis as it is easy to identify the set ups. This coming week I will make an effort to post my trade selection along with the live trade.  
  
Charts will look something like this.

First thing I will do at over the weekend is Line Chart Analysis. If you are not prepared for Monday, you will likely never be prepared for Tues, Wed, Thu or Fri either.  
Lets take a look at some line charts and locate areas to possibly take a trade.  
  
First EA 4hr Chart.  
  
I have plotted support and resistance lines on the peaks and troughs, these represent the candle bodies. I am not saying that the wicks aren't important it's just how my system works.  
You will note two levels of resistance at 6382 and 6394. All that I have done is identify two zones that price might reject and head down.  
I don't know that price will reject these and give me a short entry. I just want to be prepared. After all the market might gap up and I will have to go to plan B.  
If you are prepared you have eliminated doubt.  
More to follow....

Next is the 30m Chart of EA. I have adjusted SR lines to 6383 and 6394. Then plan is now to wait to see where price will open and trade at these levels.  
I will then monitor for a 30m, 15m or 5m entry set up.

I want to introduce you to your new best friend and a new way to enter trades. It is called The Rejection Candle.  
On the chart below I have marked it with an arrow.  
  
If we have plotted a known resistance level in advance and the market rejects that level on a bullish candle I will short the market on the close of that candle. I will not wait for a bearish candle like the next red candle.

Why you didn't enter on this bullish candle rejecting your same resistance line?

I imagine it is because your candle didn't break/attack resistance with any force whereas Islands candle broke through with some aggression only to be repelled by bears to below the resistance line ?

How do you frame support / resistance ?  
Higher to lower time frames on line chart, for example?  
I scalp on one minute Dax or sp500

It seems on the 1M chart, there was NO possible entry, where You signed it on 5M, because of the news event. Was it a demo acc.?

Hi Merka, Perhaps it would be a valid trade..as he says he Sells on Close of the Bullish candle.. That next candle looks like a profitable short.  
Pips /TP unknown but what if that was a 4hr candle...  
  
Your question is valid but one cant look past Selling on Close was a possible profitable trade with the candle you marked.. As was the next one that  
Island marked..  
  
But it very well could be his definition for him what a rejection candle is...Perhaps he needs that wick rather than the close of that bearish candle you  
pointed out is very near the high of the candle...  
  
We shall see.. Will say it again... Love the line charts and Islands approach as far as I see it to this point.  
  
Cheers 

Master your Mind,,,Master the Market

I like the fact that the second candle takes out the first candle with a wick both at resistance and I take the same trade almost always too  
  
However, it is not just based on the individual candle you posted but both together  
  
The idea being that bears hit the resistance line and then early bears were stopped out and stop-hunted before the main move happened  
  
I feel this is a sign that larger players may be grabbing stops to get the liquidity they need to short with larger size, hence the wick above resistance and the larger move that follows  
  
It is the same theory behind Wyckoff's Spring, Trader Vic's 2B pattern, Shylo's Stophunt Entry, and the recent smart money concepts related to the prior theories  
  
But it'll be interesting to see how it works on its own although I do suspect that on a lower timeframe, there will be a "2B" pattern at play

the size of the wick is too small

Hi Merka,  
There is a vast difference in the two candles, the one you have highlighted is a what I call a thrust candle, it is a very bullish candle and it could be followed by another similar candle in a _bullish trend._ The candle I have marked up has a decent sized wick and that's what I want to see at resistance. What is interesting here is your candle went up to resistance, mine went through it and rejected it followed by two further attempts by the third and fourth candles having a go at it. In this example the market was overall bearish which adds weight to resistance. 

Your trade order needs to be in the right place at the right time.

Hi Turnip,  
Can you rephrase your question " How do you frame support / resistance ?" I don't fully understand and I would like to give you an accurate answer.  
In regards to scalping using these rejection candles on 1m charts could be financial suicide. My system works well on NAS100 and SP500 using 5m time frame however I have not used on 1m charts. I will look at 1m charts on DAX, NAS and S&P this week and posts some charts and maybe a few live trades.  
  
Thanks.

As was the next one that Island marked.. But it very well could be his definition for him what a rejection candle is...Perhaps he needs that wick rather than the close of that bearish candle you pointed out is very near...

Hi Bluesteele,  
Thanks for contributing to the answer.  
Over the next few weeks I will be posting more charts with different time frames showing the entries and explain why I selected that particular trade.   
Eventually visitors to this tread will see another way to enter trades that is beneficial to their own trading system.  
  
Thanks again ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Hi LT,  
Let's clear things up. I do not trade 1m charts, I don't really want to discuss them especially when they have been and gone. I will however and I am happy to do so, will post some real time 1m charts this week. They will likely be 5m trades shown on a 1m timeframe. In regards to this being a Demo account. I have been trading for 30 years, full time for the last five. I have traded six figure accounts and taught others how to trade and invest when I worked for a company many years ago. I would not be able to pay the bills on a Demo account. I trade a much smaller account now just to pay the bills and have some fun money. I am mid fifties and found out five years ago that I would not be around forever so I thought if I can help others with their trading it would be rewarding to do so.  
I am not here to discuss account types, I am not here to discuss my personal financials. I promise nothing, I am just offering some different ways to look at ways to trade. There is nothing new to this type of trading.  
  
All the Best  
Rob

Timing the Trade. (Very Important)  
  
The system will give multiple signals throughout the trading day /night however we are only interested in a few of these setups.  
**Rule 1: Only take trades during market opens**.  
By adhering to this rule you will eliminate many of the non-required signals that the system will give.  
  
The line chart below I have boxed the sessions and the entry on candle chart at London open.  
These type of trade entries can be taken on 4hr, 1hr and 30m timeframe. When you have mastered these you can trade them on lower timeframes.

Hi Turnip,  
I have taken a look at US500 to see if there were any setups. I found one as soon as I opened charts.  
The example is how I would have traded it with my system.  
I do not trade the US session as I am usually am asleep for two hours by the time it opens.  
I have labelled the SL value and MT value similar to pips just for this example to get the MT R value.  
If I feel like a late night I will look for a live trade on NAS / S&P sometime this week.

Risk Reward Ratio.  
After posting the DAX chart I thought it would be a good time to show why I rejection candles.  
Chart 1 shows the way I would enter the trade. Chart two is how I have seen the majority and including myself enter trades using a safe entry.  
**N.B. I am just using DAX as an example as I had the charts open. I am happy to show the same with FX.**  
The safe method is getting on the train as it leaves the station. I am in no way saying that you cannot be successful trading this way because I traded like this for years.  
The issue I had with trading the safe way was the snail pace that my account was going up.  
Why was I risking $100 to make $200 only to get a few losses and go backwards? I did not like the odds.  
Many of you have probably looked at what I have posted in this thread and said he'll be getting stopped out a fair bit entering on rejection candles and you would be right however, trading rejection candles can and will give you high RR (usually a minimum of 5R) The best RR I have had was over 17R but it takes time to spot the runners. Anyway before you place a trade this coming week have a look and see if there is a rejection candle before your entry ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

Would there be a similar short around 4602 where the line chart topped and then tried to come back to test the break of a hypothetical line drawn horizontally across   
4062 (ish) ?

Hi T,  
If I have got this right as per chart, the setup is not what I class as a good setup.  
Reasons why. If you compare to the first trade at the open there a strong bullish impulse move followed by the pullback to a healthy amount of support.  
At the 4604 area there was no real impulse move. I have marked up my preferred trade which was supported by a block of support, and it is also trading with the bullish start to the day.

Hi Rob, your topic, gave me reminder, like world FX , may be terrible and toxic. So I kept the groups FX to a minimum, so many smart heads who want to show off their big dick, so little tangible, real money earned. I may not come here for 50 years. And people will keep complaining and keep looking for the magic indicator instead of developing their mind, but never mind, it's not my problem anymore. I want to thank you and congratulate you on your common sense and consistency.  
I tell you, that shared now example for m1 , can be opening haos. You showed support with higher tf. So it's not worth giving it up now. This is very risky . You said it yourself. I will include examples that will show dax from a larger perspective.

You cannot post it, because there were NO POSSIBLE entry THAT TIME. On 1M chart is clear. It is a fake trade You posted there on 5M. You want mentoring people, because You need their money as **oculus pointed out** in his post 62:  
"I would suggest to avoid giving much attention to the thread starter...

Hi LT,  
I am not going to put you on my ignore list for now. I think it is good to show other members what type of person you are. I'm not sure why you are on the attack but it does not bother me in the slightest.  
Here is your 1m chart and here is the ticket.  
Have a great day and all the best.

Hi Rob, Renko variation as discussed earlier, 10 pip bricks (20 pip reversal bricks). I took +10 pips but easily went to +20:

Same set up with EJ although I didn't trade this - ran to +30. Obviously th H4 charts have changed in appearance in both cases since the entry points:

Hi David,  
Thanks for posting the Renko Charts and well done on the GU trade.  
I believe that Support & Resistance will always be a good launch pad for a trade.  
I did not trade GU long as I need rejection wicks to enter. Chart below is what I look for each day.  
Line charts are easier to read for me.  
Thanks

Thanks Rob, just to be clear you run the H4 line chart for an overview and use an M5 chart for entry? I agree with your comment regarding visualisation preferences - one size definitely doesn't fit all when it comes to trading charts. Cheers, Dave

Hi Dave,  
I start with 4hr line chart and mark up S&R on the peaks and troughs. Then 30m chart and adjust to 30m peaks and troughs.  
Things can change rapidly so you may have to add an additional SR line. The more touches on the line the more significant the SR.  
Always remember though "Anything can happen"  
  
Regards  
Rob

Another DAX test off the same S/R zone. Ignored the second test - too close to the news, opened buy at the third test, good for +20 pips (green line open at 6870) but more resistance at the +20 level, managed to collect +3 pips as it started a big reversal:

why did you not take the trade of the first touch of the resistance area? That would have resulted in a loss. Was it due to the poor RR? if not what was the reason?

Hi Shrips,  
I waited for the market open, which is one of the rules I posted earlier.  
Reason being is just before the open the market can whipsaw.

Thats pretty cool actually...  
Placing lines for SR using line chart (close prices) is kind of unique.   
I will have a look at that.

Hi K,

Hi Traders,  
Shrips asked if I was going to posts any further charts. The answer is yes.  
As soon as I am confident there is enough activity in the New Year I will be trading and posting my trades.  
The following chart is the 15m EC trade as per the system which I missed, the second chart is the 1m scalp that I took for a 4.75R return.  
The message here is that if you miss your trade entry for some reason go on the hunt again.  
In the New Year, why not put aside some time to learn more about S&R, you will be surprised of the accuracy of it.

I have been doing some back testing over the break and from the results I have decided to update my pairs list as shown below.  
I will be taking trades on 4hr, 1hr, 30m, 15m, 5m and 1m time frame using my system.  
I have made some improvements to the system allowing for a greater RR.  
I may set up a trade explorer using an old system testing account that has about $750 in it and see how far I can take it over the year. This will be good for the low $ accounts to see what is possible.  
However, as stated in my earlier posts "I guarantee nothing" The information I post is just my view.  
I am looking forward to 2024 and for it to be a low stress, productive trading year

Hi Traders,  
I was late getting into this trade as out picking up some food.  
To start with I was watching the 4hr chart as it was heading up to Resistance / Supply Zone.  
I entered trade when I got home at 1.62856.

Hi Eric, Due to the lack of my tech skills I sometimes post the wrong chart or notes and have to edit, that's why chart disappeared for a while.  
Old age sucks.

Had you gone short for GA at the time of EA you would have been profitable too. I know GA was done during Asia session

Hi Eric,  
Yes GA would have been profitable also along with GN. I tend to stay away from GN though due to spread.  
As certain pairs are correlated I pick one pair that I like the look of (Rejection Candle and Time frame)  
Very rarely would I trade GA and GN at the same time

Yes,+ve correlation and GA not so volatile as GN. To trade both at the same time is suicidal imo. Sticking with the majors is better for my heart . As it is GU and GY are volatile enough for me.

Trade Example - Double Top  
When the market is trading upwards prior to market open and there is a resistance zone above, it is likely that there will be a reversal at market open.  
Plan of attack - Look for rejection candles at market open and short market away from resistance zone.

Hi Traders,  
Here is one Setup / Chart Pattern that I can always rely on. Every morning I go over line charts and plot SR Zones using the rectangle tool. I am looking for a break of SR or a change of trend and I find the line chart easy to identify both.  
The following chart is a simple break out through the Resistance Zone and a retest to support.  
Note: The retest occurred prior to US market open. with the Entry Candle being at 16.30 when the market had opened.  
It is a simple chart pattern that occurs on all time frames.

Hi Jepeto,  
There are many trading systems that are similar to each other however they will never be the same. This can be proved by giving 10 people the exact same system.  
You will find that you will get 10 different sets of results. Trading systems are mechanical, the trader is subjected to emotions during trading (The human element) thus causing varying results. You are welcome here to learn from me and others that post charts and ask questions. This system is not the system of all trading systems it is basic price action with support and resistance along with some supply and demand that is available to all. I have just my twist on it. So please learn with other traders here and we can all profit from knowledge.  
All the best  
Rob

Hi Traders,  
Just a reminder, when you place trades on your own systems check to see if there was a rejection candle before your entry that you could have entered the trade.  
If you can adapt to entering trades this way you will be able to improve the RR on the trade.  
If price has broken resistance it will usually return to pick up more orders at support or a demand zone. The rejection candle will show that I find no reason to wait until price is heading back up. You will be paying retail prices, you want to be paying wholesale prices. 

Your trade order needs to be in the right place at the right time.

Good point.The rejection candle is the liquidity of the market,there no reason to wait confirmation,you have more RR and minimize your stop loss.

Hi Traders.  
EN is a good example of 4hr support and resistance that can be utilized. I will be watching this week for rejection candles at these levels.  
Plan your trade in advance and wait for price to be in the right place at the right time.

I am looking at UY for a short..The trend is seriously down on the htf..a bit of retrace would be ideal for a short at the zone on my M15 chart. I have 3 levels for the traget and I will take one step at a time in case it bounces at the 1st level..the problem now is whether we can get a retrace up to the zone on my 15 minute chart

> I am looking at UY for a short..The trend is seriously down on the htf..a bit of retrace would be ideal for a short at the zone on my M15 chart. I have 3 levels for the traget and I will take one step at a time in case it bounces at the 1st level..the problem now is whether we can get a retrace up to the zone on my 15 minute chart {image} {image}

Hi Eric,  
JPY Holidays until Thursday so UJ may drift around at the start of the week, it depends on what USD is doing.  
Short is the right direction however you might get some good lower timeframe trades on the retrace.  
I will be looking at JPY pairs from Thursday  
Regards  
Rob 

Your trade order needs to be in the right place at the right time.

Hi Eric,  
I would expect something like this for UJ. It's just my take on it.

There was a break of structure (bos) on Thursday when the candle closed below that level (zone) and on Friday it was confirmed with a bearish candle close. IMO short looks better and if price does retrace that's even better as I get a better value for money(vfm) entry

The zone in green can be the area for my 1 st entry and the one in grey would be my last short for the week's play

I was so pissed off with myself last Friday for taking this trade off for a loss of 2 pips rather than letting it hit my stop. What made me do it was beyond understanding. Fortunately my other trades made up more than enough to cover what I would have gained on the loonie

I have done that a few times and it is the worst feeling. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f629.png?v=15.1)

Hi Traders,  
I will be looking to short UJ at a higher price if it continues up at approximately 141.84 that's if it gets there. We'll see how things pan out tomorrow.

Rob

Hi Em,  
Not off topic at all. The first time I had ever heard of Malaysian SnR was when Jepeto mentioned it the other day. I've had a look and was amazed at the similarity between the two systems. Thanks for posting the charts.   
All the best  
Rob

hi Rob  
  
there are many different online versions of the Malaysian SnR adpated to trade retail spot forex..  
all of them have the same origin basics derived from the Richard Wychoff approach to trading the markets.   
the basic is market structure seen with swing highs and swing lows which are SnR levels  
then using different trendline techniques to spot trade setups, etc.  
  
this youtube video is a quick introduction to the Wychoff trading

@mario777  
  
IF you can tell the difference from the OP' strategy then you are very good.  
  
I am trading the price Line chart using Multi-Timeframe Analysis for Support and Resistance aka SnR plus the use of Trend Line.  
No indicators required.  
  
My main trading timeframe is the 4Hr and 1Hr for setup and entry.

the OP is using purely RBS and SBR. Yours is using supply and demand zone and in your chart you are buying on supply? Thats why i said you are the only one understand because you dont want to share your setup. Only showing your result as others do.

Hi Traders,  
I've got some spare time so I will post some charts and notes that will clarify how I trade.  
Firstly in regards to support and resistance / supply and demand I look at both and have a adapted my own way of selecting trades.  
The is not an indicator on the planet that will make you successful.  
So if you want to learn how to be profitable I suggest you open your trading platform, open two charts place them side by side.  
Left chart is a line chart right chart is a candlestick chart. The time frames will be 15m, 30m, 1hr and 4hr.  
There is more to the system however no one has really asked any questions so I stopped posting.  
I am going to go through the fine details of the system over this weekend and encourage you to open your minds.  
If you are interested and put some effort in I will work with you to help you on your journey to become a better trader.  
1st Rule I don't want to see any indicators posted or discussed.  
2nd Rule Post some charts with your questions  
3rd Rule If you come to this thread and you don't agree with what I am posting, move on, no one is forcing you to be here.  
There are some great traders on FF that trade similar to me that I have a lot of respect for because they front up each day and get on with business.  
These include Em, pips29 and inthebox. There are many others but i.m not going to write a list. Take a look at how they trade and their commitment.  
I can show you something that works for me that could work for you.  
Charts and notes to follow over the next few days. 

Your trade order needs to be in the right place at the right time.

Hi Traders,  
On this chart I have plotted what I call Trading Zones. I use the rectangle tool for this. You should get the idea of why they are plotted like that but if you don't ask.

Hi Traders,  
On this chart I have added a 50Ema and a 10Ema. I am not saying that you cannot make a good living from trading with moving averages or any other system posted on FF. I want to show you where I take the trade and how it affects your risk reward.

So, you enter when there is a retest of the zone.  
If I understand your chart correctly you enter after the close of the upward candle that tests the zone.  
That - at least in my mind - means: one scenario is, of course, that price breaks through the zone and continues upwards.  
That's why many price action traders - at least - wait for one clear downward candle-close before they'd enter a sell position.  
(But I take it you have hundreds of forward test examples that tell you that you have an edge and the "early" entry is not a problem.)

Hi Josi,  
You are correct, I enter on the close of the bullish candle that has traded back to the sell zone. The blue candle must have a rejection wick. Many price action traders wait for a downward candle to get in because the brain associates the downward candle as being safe. What would you rather be a safe trader that makes 2R on a trade or learn how to trade like I do and have a TP of 7.5R. How many times can I get stopped out and still be in front compared to the safe trader?  
I treat the buy / sell zones as brick walls I believe it takes effort to break through the brick wall, the market has moved or rejected that price for a reason. If I get stopped out I lose 1%, if I have win I have 7 free trades before I go into negative. Traders have been brainwashed into the 2R principle for so long that they see no other option.  
You are probably thinking 7.5R is not possible but that would be your belief as apposed to mine.  
Thanks for your post.

Thanks for your clear answer.  
Ideally it shouldn't be your belief vs my belief (but your forward-test-results vs my belief).  
All the best and keep up the detailed explanations.

open sell on the close of that M30 blue candle needs a lot of experience and great confidence of rules-based traders with many years of trading experience and have taken thousands of trades.

@emmanuel7788 . I like the beautiful indicator at the top of your chart showing the different sessions with the big red line indicating the exact time in the different trading session we are in. Could you share the indicator if possible if you don't mind?

Hi Traders,  
On the chart below I have plotted the Trading Zones, these are High zones and Low zones of which are **all** Sell Zones.  
I plot the Trading Zones as the session progresses. The Zones are all forms of either Support and Resistance / Supply and Demand.  
Zone 2, the Low Zone is also The Trend Change Zone. When the trend change occurs the 1st pullback is the optimum place to enter a short trade.

Next lets take a look at the candles in these zones for a suitable short entry. There are three possible short entries marked by arrows. Of these three I would possibly short zone 1 however zone 5 and 6 would be my selection due to the favorable upper wicks.  
Please note I have used the 5m chart just to show you multiple zones. I rarely trade the 5m charts these days.  
You will find great set ups on the 15m, 30m, 1hr and 4hr charts.

Zone 1 (5m chart) on the 1hr chart was a valid short.

hi Rob  
  
Good reminder to do our weekend homework and prepare for next week.  
  
AU Week02 Jan 08 to 12 Intraday trading  
  
Looking at your AU H1 chart, I have several zones of interest where to trade. Intraday we there are both buy and sell potential.  
  
Noted the GAP after last Friday' NFP and the Chicago open session made big move in USD.  
  
We will probably see that GAP being filled next week.  
  
Longer term position trade will be buy zone below 6700 and down to 6640, noting the Monthly is bullish bias but we need to look at the 4.Q GDP and corporate earnings.

Hi Traders,  
Why use line charts?  
Line charts will give you a clear view of peaks, troughs and the trend change, you need nothing else.  
In the candlestick chart can you see the obvious trade?

Hi Traders,  
That's all for this weekend. I figure you have enough to keep the brain cells busy for a while.  
I am looking forward to someone posting a 10R trade in the next few weeks.  
Have a great trading week.  
Regards  
Rob

Ok, i like this and training line chart in view support and resistance. My favorite is replacalbe support and resistance. But i think this is good time, for trades in real time , because this topic is starting to get sugary like the others. Practically everything is correct and the money is pouring in ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) Show me there dirt , Trading must be taken honestly. I see examples every day where the market gives a lot of false entries from your methodology.

Hi Pelagiusz,  
What is the currency pair and timeframe? 

Your trade order needs to be in the right place at the right time.

Hi Pelagiusz,  
The candle you have highlighted is at 9.50 (10 minutes before market open) and I do not take trades until the market has opened.  
I have not traded this system on 3min charts and the lowest timeframe I would recommend is 15m charts.  
If you trade 3m timeframe I cannot help you. I have had a look at the 5 and 15m charts and I would not take a short position on either time frames.  
This type of trading is not for everyone, however if you want more clarification feel free to post some charts with questions and I will be happy to help. And please no indicators on your charts.

OK, 10min befor open is convincing. I shared also other position in gbpusd.The market is fractal, I used 3m for more examples.  
But in general, I'm saying that setting levels on candle history is a simple matter. Start doing it in real time and show here .  
  
S/R designation is discretionary. In the case of both places from the line chart it would give a good entries. but for me, my zone lower down is fresher and more decisive. You chose the first one because the candle wick looks nice.  
  
it's all simple and useful. But as long as this is fun with history, it will remain just drawing. What is the difference between your m5 audusd zone designation, post number 215. From my gbpusd 3m? Nothing for me. Both are correct and discretionary.

Hi Pelagiusz,  
If you take another look at the candlestick chart on post 215 you will notice that I plot rectangles from the wick back to the candle body. The wicks are important as they show the amount of rejection. You are also highlighting candles in what I call the dead zone. The Dead zone is a time when the market goes quiet usually before after the open. Another thing, Friday was NFP day and I only trade the Asian Session on NFP day due to the volatility. My trading system is 100% win rate and you will get stopped out. If you would like to learn more about this method of trading I would recommend you open up a 15m and 30m charts in the background of your trading system and just watch for the next two weeks how the market trades during market opens. There is usually 1.5hrs of good trading time. I will do my part to answer your questions and post charts to show you how beneficial It will be in learning to use line charts with no indicators.  
Thank you for asking these questions, I look forward to hearing from you.  
  
I have a question for you. You have two moving averages on your chart, what exactly are they telling you?  
Regards  
Rob

Hi Traders,  
This mornings trade. Just to show we all make mistakes. I shorted AJ 15m and wife wanted to go to beach for a swim so I put trade into breakeven only to come home and see I had missed out on a 7.5R TP  
There will always be trades like these.

Hi Rob, moving average are only for general view , i often forget about them. I'm pullback trader , looking for good places to swing low/high and other methods, but most important for me (also for you) is correct reaction in zone. So line chart open my eyse even more. How with great precision i can drawing my zone in multi TF.   
I may look at the market a little differently, but we think alike. In free time, i will show you my system decisions and you answer me, what you think ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

H1- definitely break of structure- i designate last swing- usually is there low and high, chart line give me precision.  
M15- two local zone and low swing h1 persepective. Potencial Entry  
M5- only after confirm on the zone candle wick to high TF(h1/m15). Entry size scaling.

The retest (mirror level) is one of my favorite patterns. However, I have to analyze the behavior of price and waves bar by bar in order not to make a mistake.

Hi pelagiusz,  
As my signatures states "Your trade order needs to be in the right place at the right time."  
This is where you need to be getting into the trade.  
It takes practice to spot these trades, so stick with it and you will see progress.  
Regards

Hi Pelagiusz,  
You would be getting in too late if you are shorting the red arrow.  
Just before where your arrow is there is a cluster / block of candles indicating support.  
You need to trade the opens for 1.5hrs  
GJ is showing some support. It is finished for the moment (Dead Zone)

My view on the dragon(GY) is price will almost certainly drop below the lows as shown by the line drawn to sweep out all the stops lying there.,not sure whether it will retrace from there or dive further down to the rectangle (zone in green) before bouncing up, just my opinion

Best to wait until market open, there will be some movement then.  
All the best

Hi FXState,  
  
Just to clarify,  
A bullish rejection candle is a bullish candle with a wick at the top. It was very bullish however it has pulled back.

Hi Em,  
Selling the close of a swing low is not part of my system as it rarely gives me the 7.5R target. I will only sell the bullish rejection candle and buy the bearish rejection candle.  
My system is similar to SnR but different.  
Regards  
Rob

hi Rob  
  
Maybe I did not explain why sell at the red line level.  
  
Correct me if I am wrong,   
  
I thought I see a H4 pullback candle closed Blue ... that yellow box of 4 H1 candles,  
  
And the Daily has swing SnR level ... just two days ago

Looking at Eur/usd  
Maybe At newyork open tonight price is driven down to 15 support zone (blue line and zone box) before moving up to higher levels. Maybe get a rejection candle if that happens. What do think of this suggestion?

hi Rob  
  
How did you arrive at this 7.5R as target?  
  
Is this base on your back-testing and real time trades statistics?  
  
Reason I ask is my experience is anything between +2.5R and +5R for intraday trades is realistic and achievable.

Hi Joevern,  
The lines are lines of support and resistance from past price.

Hi Rob. Thanks for insights.Im in Australia too. Just trying out your method.  
From the Eur/Usd on 4 hr line chart. Looks like a Bullish Bias. Looking for a pullback for a long.What do you think?

On the 15 minute chart of Eur/Usd. If we have a bullish bias from the 4hr. Would Zone A or Zone B be realistic pullback? Just wondered how you see it? Thanks

Thank you Rob ,  
one more question is there any specifics rules on placing the lines ?  
Because if i places line on all the pullbacks it would look like this   
and there is a bunch of line out there @@  
Am i doing this correctly ?

Hi Em,  
+2.5R to 5R is great for intraday trades and have shown many times that it is achievable.  
I have just worked out how to consistently get 7.5R.

Good trade.  
  
I got in much later as I waited for the re-test of the HTF swing SnR level.  
  
My target is +2.5R average.

Hello Island  
  
So sorry to hear that your health issues, hinted at early in the thread, are such that you do not feel able/wish to continue posting here.  
  
Please do not get the thread deleted - there is so much for us to learn by revisiting it and you have put so much into it. Do not let it go to waste.  
  
It has been extremely helpful, and the style with which you have dealt with the detractors has brought a smile to my face.  
  
I wish you all the very best  
  
David

Hello Everyone,  
  
I just stumbled on this thread 3 days ago. It is sad to see that Rob won't be able to continue with his posts any longer.   
I wish we could continue his work and request all members, specially seniors to continue posting their setups for the day. For example Support and Resistance lines for on the daily/4 hour chart followed by 30 min charts and potential trade opportunities.  
  
Yesterday I took EURJPY buy at London open and today I took USDCHF at London open.  
Personally London open suits my time zone.  
  
Thanks everyone

Hi Traders,  
Thank you for all your best wishes.  
I am going to attempt to post again. I won't always be around due to health. Due to my condition I cannot write and speech is limited, however I can type and post charts.  
I have got about six months left before I will likely shut down permanently. So lets see if we can make some profitable traders out of some of you.  
I am currently short AU.

SL 5, TP 38  
7.5R if TP reached  
  
SL moved to breakeven. Not sure how the market will open

Hi Mallee,  
Maybe these charts will help. I always use a 15m and 30m chart to identify trades.

Hello Rob,  
Will it be possible for you to show the 4Hr chart of this trade with S/R marked?  
Thanks

Hi Rob  
  
I may have this wrong but it was my understanding that you first mark support and Resistance on 4Hr charts and then adjust them to 30min and 15min, so I wanted to know did you directly mark these points on 30min and 15 mins or were they 4Hr lines that happened to coincide with 30 mins?  
  
Thanks

Hi Machiyara,  
Attached are 4hr, 1hr and 30m charts. I have not adjusted the lines from 4hr. The trade was an obvious buy.  
Hope this helps.

Hi Rob,  
Thanks for posting the multiple timeframe charts that was really helpful.  
I am confused about a small thing, the trade that you took the candle appeared on 1:30pm Australia time, however in your charts before you said you trade at 8am and only look for opportunities in the first 1.5 hours, so the question is can we apply this strategy at any time of the day?

Hi M,  
My MT4 terminal time was 4.30 when I took the trade.  
Asian session for me is 3.00 - 4.30  
Local time 9.00am - 10.30am. This will change to 8.00am to 9.30am when daylight saving ends in March.  
  
I think I have supplied enough information on this trade and timeframe, lets move on.

Hi Traders,  
Over this weekend I am going to post my system in detail. If there is anything you want to know just ask the question.  
I used to keep the system to myself as I thought why should I share it with anyone. After becoming unwell the last thing I wanted was money and my attitude changed.  
I have been training a trader in the UK for the last 10 days and found it gratifying. I think the hardest thing about teaching someone is getting them to change their beliefs.  
Beliefs are everything in trading, the can be created, reinforced and destroyed sometimes without you even knowing. Years ago I went to a seminar by Louise Bedford. Louise told us a story about a test she did on her husband. Every morning when her husband came down from upstairs ready to go to work she told him you look great today which put a smile on his face and off he went to work. This happened from Monday to Thursday and Louise told us that he was a different person, happy at work and talking positively. On Friday he came downstairs as usual, a smile on his face and as he walked into the kitchen Louise looked him up and down and said "Your not wearing that are you" Poor old husbands face dropped and he was lost for words. His belief that was created on Monday and reinforced through to Thursday had been destroyed in a matter of seconds.  
  
So, how does this story relate to trading and my systems?  
It has everything to do with trading and my system.  
  
How many of you believe that 2R targets are what you should be getting on winning trades?  
How many of you believe that if the market is trading above a moving average the trend is up?  
How many of you believe that using indicators will make you a better trader?  
  
These are just a few beliefs that you have read or been told and reinforced over time and they will destroy your chances of success.  
Everything about trading has been designed and calculated to keep you from being successful.

Hi Traders,  
The Trader in the UK I am teaching is learning fast however he has asked a few questions that are not inline with what I am teaching him. (Sorry A to use you as an example) What is happening here is old beliefs are resurfacing which is okay for now but those beliefs will need to be changed if he wants to succeed and that is the hardest part of learning something new.

Hi Traders,  
Some of my beliefs.  
1\. The majority of traders here do not believe that 7.5R is possible on a trade. To quote a saying from a classic Australian film "Tell him he's dreaming"  
2\. The majority, if not all traders believe that trading without indicators is risky.  
3\. I believe that indicators are useless and risky.  
4\. I believe that I can and will get 7.5R on my trades.  
5\. I believe that you will become that of what you strongly believe in.  
  
So moving on. I will post everything here I believe you require to make you not only successful but a unique trader.  
The rest is up to you.

Many Thanks,  
I have accepted my health situation and enjoy each day as best as I can. When you know you have limited time it makes you reevaluate what is important.  
You cannot buy extra days.  
The advise I give on life is, make memories with your loved ones, learn to forgive, If you love someone tell them every day.  
We live in a harsh world but we as individuals don't have to live that way.

Hi Rob, I just want to thank you for your knowledge and wisdom that you are sharing here. I am your silent reader. I incorporated your system in my trading for the last few weeks and the impact is amazing. I have doubled my small live account for the last 2 weeks with this high probability setup and the only loss I had is when I putting my SL at BE (maybe due to commission).  
  
I have been trading for few years and I really like how you approach the market.

About 30 Rob, of which I estimate is about 20+ too many. Which is why I end up b/e most of the time.

On average I take 5-6 trades per week. D, h4, m30 being my favorite timeframes. i dont like going below m30. But I am new so i overtrade and get revenge on the market after losingtrades. that is when i take 10-15 trades.

Hi Traders,  
Okay, down to business.  
  
My system is based on traders beliefs about price at a given time. It also factors in the manipulators that are swinging the market for huge profits each day.  
  
A Tipping point.  
Malcolm Gladwell states  
A **tipping point** is a point in time when a group—or many group members—rapidly and dramatically changes its behavior.  
  
So when enough traders believe or have been told or in trading shown that something is expensive traders will start selling. This creates a mass of beliefs that were created at a set price (Resistance) and reinforced as the market trades lower.  
As you hop onboard when the market goes down your belief is you were right to sell and you feel good about yourself.  
Congratulations you have just been manipulated.

Hi Rob.   
I made about 1 or 2 trades a day, so around 5-10 a week. I trade only one pair - GU.  
  
I believe that the naked chart is the only way to get consistent success result. Putting indicators on the chart just makes it more difficult to see the truth.  
  
I'm sorry for your health and wish you the best. Sorry for my English.

GoodDay Rob ,  
Glad I found your thread. Been looking at no indicator methods for many months. Have not used bottom of the screen indicators for years. For awhile used the chart price line instead of candles. I liked trading the price patterns that the line made so evident . But eventually didn't like that the range of a candle is not evident when using the line chart.   
In the last two weeks, inspired by your thread and chart examples from another trader, I arrived at a no indicator trader..... Rob Smith TheStrat trading method which trades off of prior candle patterns. (At first I thought it was you ! ) It uses Higher time frames: M W D for context and for trading...but can go lower. . (Also not to be confused with a different Strat PASR here on FFF .)   
I think your methods and Rob Smith TheStrat are very compatible and may even support one another . I hope to post some charts... but unfortunately my laptop and the FFF site are not always cooperating with one another . FYI I am not wanting to intrude on your method so let me know if my posting will not work for you.

Hi Yuriy,  
Sorry, I don't have enough time to explain how CM works.  
There is plenty of information on FF about CaveManager. that you can study.

Hi Lou,  
Thanks for dropping by.  
I am okay with you posting some charts, I'll let you know if the charts are a problem, in that they would conflict with what I am attempting to convey here.  
I would like to see someone this week to use my template and have a go with identifying some entries and post a line chart / candle chart.  
Could this be you? No Pressure ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f600.png?v=15.1)

Hi Traders,  
Tomorrow morning I will attempt to post some info on what I see as the market opens.  
I will let you know which pair I will be looking to trade, the reason why and if I get to place the trade I will post the chart.  
Mondays can be quiet so no promises.

Hi Traders,  
Chart is daily AU SR as I see it. We have had a tweezer bottom followed by a bullish thrust Candle. The path of least resistance is up. Will it go up when the market opens?  
I don't know. It does not take long to look at a few charts before market open, It is something that you should always do but remain open to change.

Hi M,  
At this stage I am going to have to say I would prefer you not to post charts with indicators.

Hi, Rob  
Nice thread with good information, thanks. IMHO, your entry looks pretty much aggressive. This should be ok if a few big winners can cover many small losses. Win ratio could matter in this case..... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1) Personally, I prefer some confirmation such as clear breakout of structure,... etc.

Hi M,  
As you have posted GJ, lets run through it from how I approach selecting a trade.  
The first chart that got my attention is the weekly.  
You can see that this is the second attempt at the high and it was broken followed by a sharp reversal  
The candle also closed inside the body of the prior swing high candle.  
  
I am thinking that GJ may head down this week

GJ continued  
  
So I have looked at weekly, Daily and 4hr and they are indicating that there will be some downward movement.  
However I would not rush in just yet.  
Looking at the lower time frames I think it still has a bit of fight left in it.  
As I am uncertain GJ gets rejected for now.  
I would like to see more negative price action before it gets put on my watch list.  
Lets see what tomorrow brings with this one.

Basically I use same idea but zigzag and price is hidden.  
AU is buy for me on Monday.  
Solid lines on weekly and dashed like on daily chart.  
Solid line 1st target, Dashed 2nd target.

I closed GJ at double top on Friday. Two weeks in trade, longest for me.  
Entered on engulfing candle 2 weeks ago. Trading longer timeframe   
take long to trade to work out. But if I look my profit for a trade, 1-2 trades a month is enough.

Thanks H for dropping in.  
In regards to my entry being aggressive I will partially agree with you. I think it was Em that said you need balls of steel to enter trades this way.  
I'll give you some more info into why I enter trades this way as it will help others here as well.  
  
I am going to use this line chart again to explain.  
There are two trend changes on this chart and I think you would agree that you would trade them yourself.  
I also know that you are not alone, there is likely millions of traders around the world and some large institutional traders that are forcing the trend change.  
So the trend has changed and we all want to get in on the action.

The safe trader and there is nothing wrong with being safe waits for confirmation otherwise it is deemed risky.

My view is that the trend has changed and created a support level and that support level was created by a high volume of traders believing the market is going up. (My belief also)  
When I look at support / resistance I picture a stone wall that would take some getting through.  
I see price trading back to the stone wall and realizing that it's not going to get through a therefore it backs away from it.  
This is the rejection Candle where I get in.  
If I buy something I am not going to pay top dollar for it because I feel safe. I want it as cheap as possible so I can maximize my gains.

Hi Traders,  
This a good time to talk SL and Targets.  
The following is my SL TP for my trades.

Size: 1 KB](/attachment/image/4634828/thumbnail?d=1705832577)](/attachment/image/4634828?d=1705832577)   

  
  
As you can see the range is 3 to 10. I do not enter trades with a SL greater than 10 ever.  
If I see a trade that requires a SL of 15 for example I will not buy or sell on close of the rejection candle I will put in a limit order with a 10 Pt SL  
These numbers are not random numbers that I have plucked out of the air they are a result of a fair amount of research.  
The TP is always 7.5R

Sorry EgoMist, but I have put you on my ignore list. I don't like to ignore others however if you post something here that is not consistent with the strategy you will be ignored. This is nothing personal, I just don't have the time to explain why certain posts do belong here.  
  
**Post anything that distracts traders away from learning this strategy = instant ignore list**

Hi Traders,  
A tip for the days trading. Put notes on your chart before each trading day, use anything you can to be prepared. Trust me you won't like the feeling of missing a 7.5R trade.

Notes could be:  
Wait for impulse move then watch for pullback  
Waiting on price to close in zone  
Possible setup for Euro session

Hi Traders,  
UJ is still my primary candidate for a short at this stage. It needs go down a bit further then I will be looking for a pullback entry.  
Tip: Never focus on one pair and build a belief about it. Always be flexible and willing to change in a second.

something going on in Tokyo this week, be prepared for the next big move ...   
  
last week ended with pull-back from 148.75 on Daily ... be careful with carry trade, there will be great amount of volatility your small stop loss cannot handle.

I always advocate to have a Plan A and a Plan B when day trading. Sometimes, even have a Plan C to catch the big fish.

Hi Em,  
I always monitor news. I can handle the stops even a gap. One 7.5R win fixes everything.  
Thanks for the post. It is another note traders can add to their charts so it is staring right at them. 

Your trade order needs to be in the right place at the right time.

hi Rob  
  
You are right about 7.5R.  
  
I did some quick back-test over the weekend with my strategy tester.   
Same live data Jan 2023 to Jan19 2024.   
Same candle entry, different exits, +2R, +5R and +7.5R.

Morning Traders,  
UJ trade as advised yesterday.  
Now at breakeven.  
If you have planned the trade, don't be afraid of the pullback entry.

Hi Em,

Hi Traders,  
Just one hurdle to get through, if not a +1 trade.  
These are the system rules. If I move the SL down I increase the risk of stop out.  
Lets see how it pans out.

Hi Traders,  
I want to discuss The Dead Zone. The dead zone is not a place where they send traders that don't follow their system rules although sounds like a good idea. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
The Dead Zone is the time when the market open activity has slowed. The market open activity lasts for approximately 1.5Hrs and then you will get periods of the market drifting, usually stop hunting to take out the weak traders.   
Unless your strategy is to stop hunt and accumulate you should never place trades during the Dead Zone.  
Trading takes a lot of discipline, that is why you must have a plan and stick to it.  
If you miss a trade during the opens, you have missed it so let it go. Do not try to place trades while the market is drifting, it will be the end of your trading career. 

Your trade order needs to be in the right place at the right time.

Hi Traders,  
Got messed around a bit on UJ today but no damage.  
I am currently short from 128.27 with SL at 148.21 +6  
Entry was based on retest of Resistance in a down trend.

The previous one in 4H jumped the stop with BE+1 although it is still valid.  
I re-entered this time at M30 on the retest and it is already at BE looking for 7R.

**What is going on ?? 8 hrs ago I posted the comment below referring to a chart that was posted directly above. Now that chart is missing, with a different post taking it's post #. One side of the post had a line chart which I commented on below. The other side had the identical but a candlestick chart.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f632.png?v=15.1)**  
  
{image}  
Just wanted to point out something on the _line char_ t above . The blue arrow at the upper left. Points to a price formation that I like to see. Another trader who uses both line and candlestick charts calls the line pattern a Quasimodo.. In a down move there is a high then a lower high and then a drop.  
When I use a line chart this is one of the patterns I look for... entry on the crossing of the low between the high and the lower high. The pattern shows up in the opposite direction at the lower blue arrow. Much easier (for me) to see on a line chart.

Hi Rob, I wanted to text you to talk about this supply and demand transaction a bit and it's quite interesting that we have a few things in common. It's a pity you didn't leave it in message mode. See you soon.

Hi Traders,  
Making your own trading decisions.  
  
I mentioned in an earlier post the story from Louise Bedford about creating a belief, reinforcing that belief and then destroying it in a matter of second.  
Everyone makes mistakes, it is just a flaw that us humans have. Have you ever made your mind up about something and then a little voice inside you says "are you sure"  
That little statement is so destructive it will destroy a solid trading plan.  
Things you must do to remain focused.  
You must be 100% confident in your trading system.  
You have to block out external noise (Opinions of others)  
You must stick to your trading plan.  
  
If you get stopped out and you were following your trading plan this is the best outcome.  
You must realize that you are an individual, there is not another person on this planet that is thinking the same as you, living the same as you or trading the same as you.  
Trade and believe in your system 

Your trade order needs to be in the right place at the right time.

Hi Inthebox,   
just looking at your AUDUSD M15 chart there, and noting how they use 25 pip 'boxes' to work the levels - your 0.79% fib level is also pretty much 0.6575; it then went up to 0.6600; then dropped nearly 50 pips to 0.6550-ish. I think AUDUSD is possibly the currency pair that respects the 25 pip 'boxes' / inside ranges the most ... and then on ltf the 12.5 pip increments, and so on...

Hi E,  
That is a great question and I know the answer to whether it works or not on XAUUSD  
  
How about you do some back testing, then do a couple of weeks trading and post your results then you will have your answer. 

Your trade order needs to be in the right place at the right time.

> Hi Traders, Making your own trading decisions. I mentioned in an earlier post the story from Louise Bedford about creating a belief, reinforcing that belief and then destroying it in a matter of second. Everyone makes mistakes, it is just a flaw that us humans have. Have you ever made your mind up about something and then a little voice inside you says "are you sure" That little statement is so destructive it will destroy a solid trading plan. Things you must do to remain focused. You must be 100% confident in your trading system. You have to block...

Hi Traders,  
The following chart shows the 4hr trend. I prefer the 4hr time frame over other time frames as it works well with the 15m / 30m time frames.  
The TCL is the Trend Change Line. As the market trades higher I move this line up. When the line is pierced with a strong impulse the first thing I do is wait for a pullback on the 15m / 30m charts. My view will be bearish until the TCL is breached by an impulse move and the I will wait for a pullback on the 15m / 30m charts. I do the occasional counter trend trade if price has moved a far enough distance from the trend line.  
When in down trend always try to enter trades that are double tops and in an uptrend try to enter trades at double bottoms.

Hi M,  
I have had a look at NZ weekly and I would not be surprised if NU traded lower down to support first before you get you buy signal.  
Remember this is just my view. You must follow and trade your system.

my style is that i entry at a support and end at a resistant.  
this pair had been slow moving and ranging for the past 3 days and yet i was aiming for the high of day.  
on hindsight a quasimodo (an engulfing formation) had formed in line with the left shoulder.  
i could have noted a double resistant there.

AU: LTF (1H or lower) is in a mess. However, 4H and Daily are showing a bearish possibility, IMO.

gold is very temperamental.  
when it trends it really trends.  
it is very rewarding if one gets it right.  
if not going your direction better cut loss fast.

Me too. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f91e.png?v=15.1)  
  
That's the only trade, I have taken. Not fancying to other pairs, considering the RED news lined up for the later sessions.

Hey ItB .. is this a line chart ? Can't tell/compare since I don't trade gold.  
If so...Is the Line based on closing price or is it tracking wicks ? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f438.png?v=15.1)

dear islandfx911 trader, another good thread!  
  
your approach of using only closing prices reminds me of simone's approach.  
years ago, i brought simoneg and swingtrader together so that they could pour their "buying&selling resistance levels" into an indicator.  
it was created and distributed, but it is too confusing for me and i prefer to draw the closing price resistances manually and with a free eye.  
  
about the deadzone: my deadzone is 3 hours after the london open and lasts until just before the NY open.  
however, i'm usually done for the day 2-3 hours after the london open.  
  
i also found your very tight stops interesting and that you avoid indicators.  
my experience is completely different.  
i have very wide stops if at all and use one or the other indicator successfully.  
but mainly the price movement leads me.  
  
i almost only trade GU and occasionally EU, because it moves very similarly.  
when i have reached my daily target of 20 pips, i stop.  
with my many multiple positions, however, it is quite possible that i then have +200 or more in the statistics;-)  
  
we are all different in our beliefs and as long as we are successful, that's ok.  
  
i wish you many more pips AND of course lots of health & strength in your fight! 

trading is like dancing, don't think and just listen to the music!

Hi birdland,  
Thanks for your post. I have got so used to line charts I cannot use anything else. It is a bit like the Matrix code, with a line chart I can really see what is happening. I am not always right but that's okay.  
A couple of hours a day should be enough to make you $ for the day, well done.  
Indicators are like someone has thrown a handful of spaghetti at my screen, not for me.  
I read a posting the other day where the trader said he had 11 indicators on his chart that basically told him the same thing, I just don't get the logic it that.  
  
Just gotta keep things simple 

Your trade order needs to be in the right place at the right time.

Hi Islandfx911,  
  
thanks for the thread! i have a similar approach with S/R on line charts on higher time frames (Daily,Weekly,Monthly)  
And then entering sniper like trades on a lower TF down to 5min.  
  
But what is sometimes not transfered enough in the web etc. is that a good trader has a dozen or a million other kinds of points/"indicators" on his list, which are not described in a simple forum topic.  
Sometimes, even **you** dont know but only your subconsciousness.  
For example trading time, following news, "tick behaviour" etc. make a huge difference in the probability of the outcome.   
  
Keep up the good work and thanks,  
  
Toaster

Hi Traders,  
After GU closed above resistance at market open indicated it would go higher.  
A fast decision but the right one.

Every night I get a cup of hot chocolate at bed time and a blue viagra tablet.  
The hot chocolate sends me to sleep and the tablet stops me from rolling out of bed.

> Hi Islandfx911, thanks for the thread! i have a similar approach with S/R on line charts on higher time frames (Daily,Weekly,Monthly) And then entering sniper like trades on a lower TF down to 5min. But what is sometimes not transfered enough in the web etc. is that a good trader has a dozen or a million other kinds of points/"indicators" on his list, which are not described in a simple forum topic. Sometimes, even you dont know but only your subconsciousness. For example trading time, following news, "tick behaviour" etc. make a huge difference...

congratulation to your trade!   
  
now i have one question: your SL is -7 and was heading this trade into big red news.  
  
what would you have done if the SL was hit with a 30-50 pips slippage? do you take that into your trading consideration when trading red news? 

trading is like dancing, don't think and just listen to the music!

Hi birdland,  
I think I mentioned this before somewhere.  
I have been caught out a few times where the market has smashed me for a 8% loss on red news.  
My TP is 7.5R on all trades so it does not bother me if I get the occasional whipping.  
If I was running a 2R system I would not trade the same way.  
This is a very different way to trade, it was very tough in the beginning but over time it gets easier.  
I never trade NFP or Nasdaq as I got a hiding on both.

Hi Traders,  
Thanks for tuning in. This week has been very tiring so I am going to take the rest of the week off.  
I have some private mentoring that I have neglected and need to catch up on.  
I hope I have done some good here and you have got something from my posts.  
Talk next week.

While I have had lots of experience trading, using indicators (moving averages, RSI) in my early years, now trading naked charts (it took a long, difficult period of a complete mind change Inthebox!), I am always blown away by the simplicity (and beauty) of price charts and their narratives. Price has a memory, sell orders get filled at premium, buy orders get filled at discount, and when there are few orders around, the market makers move price to where there are more. Pretty simple, really.  
  
I know it's easy to post a hindsight chart, but as they say, hindsight builds foresight... so here is my take on GU H4 with SR levels.  
  
I understand Island takes trades straight off the line chart, as price reaches those extreme S/R levels... i admit I'm not there yet, I would drop down to lower timeframes to find entries. Personally I'm a fan of all candlestick reversal patterns, including Morning star, Evening star, hammers, inverted hammers, hanging man, M & W Patterns on M15/M5, etc. However I can see the power and simplicity of Island's style.  
  
One question I have for Island is - how do you know when a S/R level going to be a Primary level (strong) or a secondary level (weaker)? Is it based on the number of supports/rejections at that price? Or big round numbers? Or whether price is at premium/discount extremes?  
  
The reason I ask that (and I know it seems a really basic question) is because I struggle with taking trades as price is reaching 'a level.' Maybe I have lingering 'doubts' issues from my days of using indicators... anyway I continue to grow and develop.  
  
Thanks to Island and all who positively contribute here.

I thought someone might find this useful.  
The chart posted combines the line chart which tracks only closing price , with the H and L of price as if it was a candlestick or bar chart.  
Blue Line = closing price. aka a Line Chart  
Black lines = the high and low that a candlestick makes before it closes.  
Your charting package needs to have a certain type of moving average in order to construct this ... but the chart display does not show a moving average.  
The application I have is on MT4 and listed as Moving Average. This version might be special because it allows you to select different parameters as.. high and low ... thus giving the black lines. The setting should be for MA 1 which is the same as the Line Chart... the two charts below are identical.. just posted that way... sorry.

3.00 AM (MT4) ---> That's the time when SGX, HKE, and SSE open. Tokyo, Sydney, and NZ open a bit earlier and India opens a bit later. So all together, the ASIA open is a complex one.

You don't miss anything do you ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
Trade opened on close of 4.30 rejection candle.  
No further trades until Euro session.  
Just want to add, if this trade hits TP I do not take any further trades.  
If it is a fizzer, I will look for an entry during Euro Session.

Hi Traders,  
I added a second Long position on AU and now at +1 on both orders.  
Could do with both trades being winners as sitting below my weekly average.  
I am currently at 16R for the week if these trades reach TP it will push it up to 31R.  
  
C'mon Aussie

Hi Traders,  
Might be a pullback before open, not that I want one!  
I might take another long position if it does.

Well done,  
It is a shame that a few others are not posting here as you do. I am getting private messages but a reluctance of members to post.

they just wanted a quick and easy short cut knowledge without putting in the hard work.  
they thought knowledge is enough not knowing that it is the daily application that matters.  
asking themselves why this work, why this doesn't.  
by far, posting is the only way to expedite their learning process.  
here you still have people around to correct any mistakes.  
but we won't be around forever.  
what more if you tell them to practice at least 3 to 6 months?  
those who listen, listen. those who do not, just let it be.  
just simply reflecting that there is no deep interest from them.

I get your sentiment, but just letting you know I've posted twice today, and one post had a question for you, which is what you asked for from me yesterday...   
  
I get that I'm new here, but isn't that what you want? New people posting, showing interest?

Buyers and Sellers are waiting for the Chicago 8:30am open  
  
I'm am on the buyers side. So I look for a move up and a pull-back , then a bearish 'reject' candle with lower wick.... a classic SnR .

Blue Line = closing price. aka a Line Chart Black lines = the high and low that a candlestick makes before it closes. Your charting package needs to have a certain type of moving average in order to construct this ... but the chart display does not show a moving average.

hi @Lou  
  
I traded the stock markets with Line Chart for many years back in the 1980s.  
  
With line chart, we do not see the price gaps.  
  
In forex, price gaps are not common but these days we see more gaps more often.  
  
Example UJ H1 below, there is a significant gap in the Close and Open,

Many charts posted here are line charts, which as you show don't show gaps, but also don't show wicks .   
What I set up solves the wicks problem on one chart.

Lou…using high and low lines is something I’ve used for years. I have no use for the close line though in my style of trading.  
I have posted many live trades in the past, and if you decide to take a look, you may find something useful if you are thinking of pursuing simple chart analysis.  
Bear in mind, that high and low lines are nothing more than reference lines, and they alone are not enough, so consider what other reference would help.  
Also consider what type of orders this sort of approach best suits.  
Stuff to think about, and I may elaborate more in time….good luck

Not sure exactly what you are telling me . The chart I posted has a line chart which is based on the _Close of Price_ plus the chart shows the _High /Low of Price_ for the time frame in use. If that info is not useful, don't use it . If it is not enough, please add to the chart.

Lou…it’s ok. At least you have thought about other ways to look at the market without candlesticks etc, it’s your first step. Take your time and think about what I previously said…ie what other reference is needed to make an informed decision and what kind of orders would this approach best suit.  
Once you can answer those questions to your own satisfaction, then there’s a fair chance that you will start realising how you can use this kind of line chart in a meaningful and hence profitable way as well as in an easy and non stressful way, where your patience gets rewarded.

Hi SV,  
I have some info for you regarding which levels are the primary levels and which are the secondary.  
The question stumped me for a while because I have been doing this for so long I do not class the SR as strong or weak, however I can answer your question in the way I see SR.  
I posted this on ITB thread a while back.  
  
_In regards to your question about which A or V to use on a line chart I explain how I see things  
I am only interested in the market opening times where I am looking for a rejection of S/R or S/D.  
For example if the market is heading down prior to open and above support I am wanting to buy therefore if I am correct and the market goes up the line chart will plot a V on the close of that candle after I have entered the trade  
So the obvious A or V for me on a line chart are the ones that are about to occur at market opens. _  
  
The 4hr SR lines can be plotted where there are multiple touches however those touches are not guaranteed to be reversals.  
There was a trader here years ago called Crucialpoint, his view on SR was...  
_SR is like a set of traffic lights, sometimes they are green and sometimes they are red._  
Sometimes SR will hold, sometimes price will smash through it.  
  
So my answer is the primary SR is the is the one that is the prior closest A or V at the market opens whether it is 4hr, 30m or 15m SR  
I am only trade the opens so that is when I am looking for nearby SR.  
  
I have had a look at your charts and you have a good understanding of SR Zones.  
When I draw zones I plot the rectangle from the top / bottom of wick back to the body, this gives me an accurate zone of activity.  
Plot zones ready for pullback, double tops and double bottoms.  
Hope this has answered your question.  
  
Chart 1  
I have labelled the session opens, quite interesting how the markets reacts at the opens.  
  
Chart 2  
This is how I draw my zones.

May I ask, what is the **TF of the entering candle** that you are referring to?

Hi Traders,  
  
The following charts is my trading in a nutshell. If you can answer these questions it will show you have been paying attention or it will show whether I should continue posting.  
I have stated in an ealier post that the first pullback after a trend change is the best  
The question is.  
Can you tell me where I would enter the trade. The price the SL and the TP

Stop loss: 1.35300 like 3 pips stop loss  
  
Take Profit: 1.35047 the red line on my chart.

I am looking at the hard right edge of the chart posted on # 507 U/Cad . _At the hard right edge_ I see no chart pattern for taking a trade at that time.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f438.png?v=15.1)

Thank you for correct me.  
So the correct method I should wait for the rejected candle or the strong impulse at the S/R, right?  
Is the candle in the image below a legit confirmation?  
  
Sorry about my English is not good.

Hi T,  
You have the right idea, however I would not be trading EU during the Asian session.  
Well Done 

Your trade order needs to be in the right place at the right time.

Hi JT,  
When I trade the Asian Session there are two key times, 3.00 and 4.30. I very rarely place a trade at 3.30, 3.45 or 4.15.  
The next thing to note is that if there is a decent move at 3.00 that will usually be the direction for the day.  
3.00 signal will always be stronger than 4.30 as 3.00 is the start of increased activity where as 4.30 you are approaching the Dead Zone.  
You are always better to start with the trading the trend change if you are new to this as it is easy to spot.  
Welcome aboard ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
This chart should be your best friend for the next 6 months

Hi Traders,  
A very well done to the traders who got the trade details correct. And to the traders that did not we are all here to help you so keep posting.  
I would have been really impressed if anyone came back with the 2nd trade!!  
Some of you may have picked the arrow after the last swing low however if it had lined up perfectly it would not be an entry, because why? The chart is UC and UC does not get traded during the Asian session. That is what the test was really about. Not just placing a trade but about being aware.  
  
15R in one day. Learn the system while you can. You will never look back.

Hi SV,  
Good effort, timing was right at 10.15  
Entry acceptable  
You could have trimmed your SL which would have brought your TP closer

hi Rob  
  
There is enough here for the people to digest and continue to learn and practice on their own. When the people post their charts for sharing and discussion here, you will know who are working successfully and are on track to become independent traders.   
  
I know you have more to share but for now, take a break.

Hello Folks  
  
While Rob is needing more rest due to his health condition,  
  
we can continue here by helping each other learn to trade.   
  
Post charts for review and study since it is weekend and markets are close.  
  
When we study and review the recent days and weeks, we will learn too and know what to look for next week.  
  
Always be prepared when the market open and have your trading routine and trading tasks written down.

USDCHF flipped to buy.

guys have you made a detailed study on the question why it happened?  
what can i learn from this?  
or is it "i wished that i had captured this move"?

Consider myself a beginner and inexperienced, I was following the thread silently but have decided to take action instead of just scrolling on the sidelines. I looked at post 557 from ITB and can grasp the repetition of the bullish 1-2-3 on the AUDUSD M30, where there seems to be 4 of them in total occurring in the zone with Rob's 10R (post 555) being the most recent one. What stood out to me however is the 3rd bullish 1-2-3 in the zone. I have some snippets and annotations with my thoughts/ doubts. In case my handwriting is bad and /or for clarity here are the things that were hand-written in my snippets:  
  
Yellow line ("lightning bolt") indicates that the entire move should be considered to be one impulse move (1-2).  
  
Ambiguity on which should be the "true" entry candle? In hindsight we observe two candles that might be entry candles, but in realtime if the first candle showed itself we would have entered on the close. In that case with the second candle will our SL be taken out? How would the SL be set for this trade in particular in relation to the 4hr resistance turned support?  
  
This will be case study #1 in my notes ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) Cheers to everyone for your candid sharing! Thanks Rob for teaching us how to fish, wishing you great health!

Finished my stint for the morning and now looking at line chart for ideas for the future to incorporate in my trading.  
Have shown a 5 minute Dax and drawn some levels prior to 8am open ( for me UK) then down to one minute for trade execution.  
Anyone see a better way of drawing levels on a line chart PRIOR to 8am UK open ?  
Should a level be drawn from the "star" ?  
Comment welcome.

The more I read through this amazing thread, the more gems I pick up. Thank you so much Islandfx  
  
Does anybody know if this would have been a valid set up please? Looking to sell.  
  
I entered on the red candle after the blue arrow (3rd pic 30m), but not sure if any of these were rejection candles? The green candle has a little wick, and the red isn’t a bullish rejection (if I have understood correctly). Or on the 15m, would that of been the bullish rejection candle to sell at the aqua arrow? Thank you

> Ambiguity on which should be the "true" entry candle? In hindsight we observe two candles that might be entry candles, but in realtime if the first candle showed itself we would have entered on the close. In that case with the second candle will our SL be taken out? How would the SL be set for this trade in particular in relation to the 4hr resistance turned support? This will be case study #1 in my notes ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) Cheers to everyone for your candid sharing!

4 points to mention.  
1\. trading is not about precision. it is more like an art.  
a level is not a line drawn by a pen. it is more like a stroke drawn by a brush.  
so a level is a zone. a SL is not on at the candle wick but with some buffer.  
2\. each trader has different amount of risk tolerance.  
each will have their own estimate on much buffer to allow for SL.  
3\. we have different brokers servers resulting in different candles shape and wicks.  
3\. each trader has different trading experiences accumulated through the years.  
  
then we have to ask ourselves what type of trader are we.  
due to different personalities trading like scalper, intraday, swing, position.  
  
in other words, it is only good that a trader after learning a method  
to come up with a system that belongs to him.  
incorporating things that he had previously learnt and build a system that better suit himself.  
and all these come with experiences which involves discipline, hard work and only time can teach you.

I entered on the red candle after the blue arrow (3rd pic 30m), but not sure if any of these were rejection candles? The green candle has a little wick, and the red isn’t a bullish rejection (if I have understood correctly). Or on the 15m, would that of been the bullish rejection candle to sell at the aqua arrow?

Noted on your 4 pointers, thank you ITB for taking the time to clarify. May I ask for further clarification on whether the candles used for the FIB levels are the ones indicated in red arrows? Also building on point 2, contrary to Rob's approach where each SL between 3-10 has a corresponding RR up to 7.5. How does the SL determined with fib level differ from Rob's in your point of view? Will you still be looking for a rejection candle as your point of entry? I understand this is slightly off topic since we are deviating away from the original system but I like the idea of a system coined by a trader being a distillation of his/her discipline, experience and efforts and would love to be able to use what I learnt and will continue to learn in my journey of self-discovery.

yes fib red arrows for the up move. look out for possible entry when price pullback to 50, 62, 79.  
the 2nd entry can be at a support zone.  
i do not use RR or fib extention level for TP. i use support and resistant or fib50 to TP and also partial TP.  
yes. rejection candle close. but it can be on a lower time frame.  
in the beginning you can fully adopt what is shown in this thread,  
when you become skillful enough, you use your own preferred method.

Hi T,  
When you trade this system the main rules are Trades are to be entered after market open, Look for an impulse move followed by a pullback (You will often find that the impulse move / pullback has / is happening before market open) This is the pro getting in position for the move. The last rule is when the pullback is going up you short the market on the close of a blue rejection candle and the opposite for going long.  
There is no need for anyone to sit at their computer all day. Trade the Euro session for 1.5hrs, turn computer off. Turn back on 15m before US session and scan for impulse / pullback. I cannot emphasize the importance of this enough, You only place trades in an active market. As you are a short term trader, look at the most recent swings for you analysis.  
Here is the only trade that was valid .  
Hope this helps.  
Regards  
Rob

Hi Traders,  
I have a thought that may help you with this strategy.  
I have the time most days to go over charts and find the trade or trades that were available for you to trade as per this system each day.  
This will be **after** the trade has occurred. It will help to reinforce how this system works and what you need to look for.  
Please note that I will not be answering many posts, just the people that ask the right questions.  
It is just going to be a visual aid.  
I will give it a go for two weeks and see if it works out.  
  
Can you let me know if you are interested?  
  
This will be the format.

Yes! Just to clarify if the left border of the rectangle coincides with the wick (squiggly yellow line) of this candle?

Hi Traders,  
I traded DAX at open however SL hit for -1R. The SL does not bother me as it should not bother you if you trade this system as I do.  
I am only going to post the winning trades and this is for a very good reason. You need to focus on the winning trades and visualize these trades over and over again.  
You have to train your subconscious into recognizing and placing a trade that has a high chance of being a winner.  
If you fill that database up with winning and losing trades it will cause confusion.  
I would suggest you set up a database of the winning trades on your own computer and when ever you get time free scan through them. This will reinforce your belief.  
I do this at least 30 times a day. Make sure your office or place of trading is quiet and start scrolling ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f642.png?v=15.1)  
Forget the stop outs they are irrelevant.  
Kind Regards  
Rob

Thought I'd give it a go myself and see if any of mine happens to be one of the examples, however it'll probably have some mistakes so I hope some of them might be mistakes/doubts other may have adopting the system as well and in turn we can all benefit from learning from bad examples or potentially good ones after correcting for mistakes if any.  
  
I identified 3 potential trades but do note that they have yet to fully play out, so I'm approaching them in more of a "in the moment" snapshot without the benefit of hindsight. These trades are US pairs as such they are from the NY session.  
  
I have colour coded two areas of interest on each trade:  
  
**Orange**  
deals with the selection of candle that forms the zone for SL  
**Green**  
deals with the entry candle  
  
Please let me know if the screenshots are too small to be seen, I tried to collate one trade into a single screenshot  
  
_Trade #1_  
XAUUSD, Short  
_Doubts:_  
**Orange portion**  
Did I use the correct candle for plotting the zone for SL according to the system?  
**Green portion**  
Entry candle came 30 minutes late (during 1h30m - 2h) of the NY session, as such:

  1. Would this trade still be valid? (enter or skip)
  2. Should I have moved to LTF (15m / 5m) to see if I could have entered before the 1h30m mark?

_Trade #2_  
EURUSD, Short  
_Notes:_  
Should be a more "textbook" example, hopefully this would qualify as a "good" example  
  
_Trade #3_  
CADCHF, Long  
_Doubts:_  
**Orange portion**  
Which candle should I use here?  
Is it ultimately based on my risk appetite by counting the number of pips?  
**Green portion**  
Long example, does it work the same when one candle pushes past into the second zone instead of the first?  
  
Lastly, with the assumption that all 3 trades are valid, I also have questions from the perspective of trade selection. Would all three trades be entered? If I had to rank them 1st, 2nd and 3rd in terms of quality of setup, potential for higher RRs, etc, how should I approach this?

Hi Traders,  
EA printed a 123 TC Pattern at 11.30 which gave a valid Buy, however this would have been a stop out.  
The next candle gave a better rejection candle still within the 123 TC Pattern. It was out of my 1.5hrs but seeing the setup still valid it is good to go in again.  
Trade 2 was successful for 7.5R  
You just have to hit these trades again when they look this good.

Hi L,  
First of all, well done for giving it a go and supplying detailed charts. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)  
I only have time to answer Gold question at this stage as busy.  
Timing was acceptable to enter trade, 17.00 closing candle is within the 1.5hrs. [16.30 to 18.00]  
You could have supported you view to short with 4hr Resistance and market had traded well past the ADR.  
Also remember, Pro's push markets up before market opens so they can short them.  
  
These chart should help.  
Well Done.  
I will get to other questions if I have time.

Hi G,  
I have uploaded EU chart for you to compare the first entry. You were a bit early but all good.

Hi Traders,  
  
During the Asian session there was a short setup on AU as per chart.  
Something I want to point out is the stop size. The setup candle would need a SL of 8Pts of which is too high. You have to enter these trades with a limit order. My SL for AU is never greater than 4Pts.

took it after M5 rejection from the zone.  
  
you like to look at rejections from lower times too or you mainly use M30?

M15/ M30 seems to be the most common timeframe in terms of entry from what Rob shared. I caught a valid entry candle on the M15 timeframe.  
  
From what i understood, you move to lower timeframes if the SL presented is not sufficiently narrow for your risk tolerance.  
  
You can refer to post #85, #99, #158 example of M1 entry also given on #101

More "entries" if valid and some doubts I have on them.   
  
Also, for the daily -> 4hr -> 30 minutes SR level charting process, since levels get tested and retest-ed, should we revisit and adjust them (match 4hr to daily, 30m to 4hr, etc on a daily basis?

If Rob will permit me to answer your question? The candle A you identified is an indecision or hammer candle which is not considered a bullish rejection candle. The candle identified by Rob is the correct rejection candle. A bullish rejection candle is a bullish candle with a rejection wick at resistance, while the opposite is for a bearish rejection candle.   
  
I hope you understand the difference.

The#STRAT is price action trading mainly on focus on reading candlesticks ... Inside Bar, Outside Bar and Thrust Bar.

Was scanning through the pairs for London's session and this seems like a promising M30 entry candle for XAUUSD shorts. However XAUUSD has been bullish for the past week, unlikely to be able to push the RR too much. That being said if we look at the next 4hr key level if it does go all the way there it will be about a 7.73RR. Still 6 minutes to go before the candle close, will wait and see if it closes as a bullish rejection candle

Hi Lou,  
I have put years into this system. It is 100% mine. And I have made it free for all.  
If you want to post "Rob Smith The#Strat no indicator system" go ahead, I will not judge.  
You have mentioned it twice now I think.  
How about you throw us some charts?  
We are all here to learn together  
Regards  
Rob

Hi Rob,  
  
first off great thread. I have been trading on and off demo without much luck for the last 6 - 12 months primarily with indicator based systems and could never really grasp the price action of the market, this thread has actually put a lot of the pieces of information i have gathered over this time and really helped me to see support/resistance levels & see patterns that were previously a blur even though i "knew" what i should be looking for, so thank you.  
  
I would like to know from you experienced traders, how do you determine your bias? i used to have my methods with my indicators. i know i can simply look at long term direction higher highs/ lower lows to determine a trend. but i more intrigued as to whether you guys may base bias of previous day candle for intra day trading etc. if the trend has been going for some time and may be exhausted. This week i made some great trades using the bases of this system. and this system has kept stops low, however i noticed the trade that do stop out i have noticed go on a run in that direction so i am missing my bias reading. any help here would be muchly appreciated.  
  
Unfortunately, i wont post any charts respectfully as i cannot trade the system as per the rules laid out by rob as i am also from Australia and leave home at 8am for my dreaded 9-5 so i miss the Asian and London opens and can really only practice in the deadzones. but know i will be checking in on the thread everyday as i have found all the information here invaluable .

@dgsforex based on what Rob has shared, there seems to be 3 evergreen pairs that can be traded across EU/Asian/US sessions. I kept a note of these and reorganized them so it's clearer. Depending on where you are at in Australia you might be able to scan and trade the US session if it isn't too late in the night for you.

Rob, no words can express how grateful I am for your sharing. Stumbled really is how I came upon this thread, and with my limited knowledge and experience on trading, it isn't the case where other threads had concepts that was easily grasped and applied in such short periods of time. Your quote really encapsulates the whole experience of me being in the "right place at the right time".  
  
Updates on the trade unfolding, the dip actually happened so fast that I wasn't able to to adjust my TP levels in time for the next SR level. The remainder held after the 7.5RR partial taken was exited at 12.25RR for the AUDUSD trade.  
  
Additionally, I also took a trade on XAUUSD, which behaved very similarly to AUDUSD. Definitely some correlation, but i'm sure there are nuances between the two. Held a running small sized position from the earlier ~60s sell, so that added onto the win as well.  
  
Not too upset that some money was left on the table since there wasn't much under my control that I could change.  
  
It's a good start to the year and my journey in trading, cheers to you and the others in the thread, I'm sure there's plenty more trades to learn from and take down the line!

Thanks for your comment.   
I am just looking for another trader who is also using the method I mentioned. it is a ' no indicator ' system as well, hence my post on a No Indicator thread. At this point I am not ready to explain or teach the system. I am seeking a trader who like me is already is using the system so we can collaborate.   
There does not appear to be anyone like that here.  
Thank you kindly.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f438.png?v=15.1)

Hi Traders,  
I have put together five trades that were available this week. I took some of the trades and I know a few of others did. I also had some annoying stop outs as we all do.  
Firstly I will let you know it is not easy to start with, however if you can adapt to this way of trading and you are successful at it you can turn $5000 into a million.  
But it will take extreme measures to do so. Throughout the year you will have hurdles like health, fatigue, Taxman wanting his bit which will send you backwards for a while, dealing with me shutting down for sometimes 2 or 3 days. Holidays you will need to take with family and you must have Discipline, Discipline, Discipline. While this thread has been open I have shown you a new way to trade to a success future. Some of you believed, some of you said "Tell him he's dreaming" I assure you it is possible if you commit at the highest level. I currently have 35 subscribers and out of the 35 I have four that I believe could make a million in 1 year. At the end of February I am going to invite the most promising traders that have mastered my trading system to work together as a team to discuss the trades available on a daily basis. Why am I doing this, simple 'Strength in numbers' I will set up a live platform to do this however all trade information will be posted here on FF so others can learn. This is not a paid service and never will be EVER. It is about educating ourselves and passing that information on so that others can have a better life.  
  
Trades this week.  
+10R, +7.5R, +7.5R, +7.5R, +7.5R Total = 40R  
ROI 44%  
Something I need to add here, stop outs occur, I have had 4 this week.   
I am happy if I get a 3 winning average which is about 21%.  
You just have to find the one trade of the day. Being in the right place at the right time.

Thanks Islandfx911, I am continuing to refine my trading skills using your method.  
Many thanks

[quote=Islandfx911;14742320]Hi Traders, I have put together five trades that were available this week. I took some of the trades and I know a few of others did. I also had some annoying stop outs as we all do. Firstly I will let you know it is not easy to start with, however if you can adapt to this way of trading and you are successful at it you can **_turn $5000 into a million._** But it will take extreme measures to do so. Throughout the year you will have hurdles like health, fatigue, Taxman wanting his bit which will send you backwards for a while, dealing with me shutting down for sometimes 2 or 3 days. Holidays you will need to take with family and you must have Discipline, Discipline, Discipline. While this thread has been open I have shown you a new way to trade to a success future. Some of you believed, some of you said "Tell him he's dreaming" I assure you it is possible if you commit at the highest level. I currently have 35 subscribers and out of the 35 I have four that I _**believe could make a million in 1 year.**_ At the end of February I am going to invite the most promising traders that have mastered my trading system to work together as a team to discuss the trades available on a daily basis.

Hi Em,  
Sorry but, I am not going to go down the path discussing $ Risk statistics  
I know that you would have already done the numbers on this, I am surprised you asked.  
  
All I am offering here is a trading system that I believe if mastered could create better than average returns.

hi Rob,  
  
I think it is possible to make one million dollars in one trading year.  
  
... however we need to start with $500,000 and in about 1000 trades ... risk to reward 1 to 7.5

Yes, you can be a millionaire too anytime soon .... but first you have digest and master the position sizing game in investing.  
  
here is a good place to start:  
  
[https://www.babypips.com/learn/forex...position-sizes](https://www.babypips.com/learn/forex/the-importance-of-correct-position-sizes)  
  
next, learn both the Lotto model and the Insurance model, and you develop your own CashFlow model to make that one million dollars.

It is very possible. But now at my age i dont chase the money now. I did in the past and now i trade 5 figures but 4me at my age (60) i dont need the stress anymore. My house, ex-wife, cars etc are all paid off so i am more than happy with 6-10% per month. 6% will double your account by EOY..... I know you aint a newbie but i would suggest newbies taking it slow and treating it as a long term business

Hi T,  
I have been debt free for a number of years, there is no better feeling. However money is of no use to me anymore and sadly 60 is something I won't see.  
You are right with your advise to Newbies. 'Take it slow and treat it as a long term business'  
All I am hoping for now is to teach this system to a handful of traders that will keep things going here. I want to know I did some good here. 

Your trade order needs to be in the right place at the right time.

I have the time most days to go over charts and find the trade or trades that were available for you to trade as per this system each day. This will be after the trade has occurred. It will help to reinforce how this system works and what you need to look for. Please note that I will not be answering many posts, just the people that ask the right questions. It is just going to be a visual aid. I will give it a go for two weeks and see if it works out. Can you let me know if you are...

Surely it depends entirely how you trade. If you take it week by week assuming you get 2 trades right a week and 3 trades wrong at 1% risk that is an average of 12% weekly and in that case you would go from $5,000 to $1,000,000 in less than a year.

Surely if you have pending orders you won't have seen whether there is a rejection candle or not.

Hi M,  
When I place a trade I am following my trading system entry rule, I have no idea how long it will take to hit SL or TP.  
This particular trade was about 12 - 13hrs.  
The confidence in holding a trade comes from believing in your trading system.  
You should be able to place a trade and forget about it.  
You have to remember that I target 7.5R TP with a 1R SL  
You can throw trades at me all day, I love it.  
I will posts my charts prior to tomorrows open with likely entries.  
Why don't all of you put a 0.01 lot trade on with a 15pt SL and 7.5TP. What have got to lose?  
What have you got to gain?  
  
Lets have some fun ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
Pairs will be AU, EA, UJ, EJ and GJ.  
I will post any valid setup.  
During the Asian Session the best time to place trades are at 3.00 and 4.30.  
Who cares if we all FK it up. 

Your trade order needs to be in the right place at the right time.

I use pending orders if the wick is large. My max SL is 10Pts so if SL is 18Pts I set a pending (Limit Orders 10Pts from close)  
  
I forgot to mention if a Blue Bullish Rejection Candle retraces to far it becomes a Pin Bar and if you trade it you have defeated the whole point of this system.  
Get stopped out twice at -4 twice on a good rejection bar is acceptable and easy to recover.  
Get stopped out twice at -8 and you are in trouble.  
Never trade a Pin Bar 

Your trade order needs to be in the right place at the right time.

do you use SL/tp? you must quantify those 2 in order to be able to run backtests...with the naked eye many systems seem to work but the numbers dont lie

Hi Traders,  
I'll get started on chart analysis ready for tomorrow.  
  
Weekly chart showing SR

So we have put together some analysis on AU. Now comes the important part and I want you to pay special attention to what I have to say.  
In the morning I have not got a clue what the market is going to do as none of you do.  
So in my great wisdom I give you the following advice.  
If you get a Buy signal, Buy it.  
If you get a Sell signal, Sell it. 

Your trade order needs to be in the right place at the right time.

Hi T,  
I do not trade GU in the Asian session. You have the right idea though.  
Everything will look different in the morning.

Was catching up on the updates to the thread... somewhere I read that Rob believes that _**some**_ can go from $5000 to a millionaire in a year with the information shared here, while some thinks it may sound too good to be true.  
  
I re-visited post  
**_#306 ([https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...1#post14726161](https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/post/14726161#post14726161))_**  
and  
_**#310 ([https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...9#post14726169](https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/post/14726169#post14726169))**_  
and came to a conclusion, both are right....  
  
Time for me to prepare for the new week ahead...

Hi Rob, noticed that you only have 3 lines per timeframe for the higher timeframes (weekly, daily, 4 hrs). Is that a rule in the system, or is it based on what you see from the line charts for that particular pair, I have more than 3 lines usually across all timeframes and I realised it might hinder decision making in a bid to capture more signals based on what the chart is telling me. Is there a recommended limit on the number of levels for the various timeframes to prevent over-charting? (more noise than signals, leading to confusion when we bring them down to lower timeframes)

HI ISLAND  
  
thank you very much for everything you do for us. sorry to know that you are not in good health. When there is life there is hope. if you believe in God then go to playstore or app store and download the "KANGUKA" application then you select the English language and you listen with faith to all the Saturday prayers and God will heal you no matter what illness you have.   
A doctor's prognosis is not God's. I suffered from an incurable disease and God healed me through this application. All you need to do is have faith and you will be healed.  
Good healing to you

Hi L,  
Lines are plotted where I see obvious SR levels, I usually plot one close to current price, one above and one below

Rob is right.  
only applies to the skilled and experienced traders.  
just by looking at post 1, they already know what it is all about.  
  
if this method is being taught to a class of 10 students.  
it is realistic to assume that they have very different results in live trading.  
some with profit, some with loss, some with break even.  
so it is all relative.  
  
back to reality.  
with daily discipline, patience and consistency to learn and take action with application for 6 months, some will make it. so it is not just simply to obtain knowledge.  
some even after 10 years also cannot make it. they have difficulty in grasping concepts. then they have to realize to stop knocking their head on the wall.

Note; The STRAT price action trading is quite complex for those who do not like to read the candles ... candle-by-candle as they develop. You need to learn to read every candle and interpret the market movements. Quite tiring when you do this in lower timeframes like m5 and without the higher timeframes views, you will run into trouble with mental exhaustion.

Hi Traders,  
Took a long on EJ, This is a higher risk trade as it was taken off support but heading into resistance.  
Just thought I would post it to see what happens.

I've researched Rob Smith and his "TheStrat" method, he had a website that sold his material but unfortunately he died last year and unbelievably some one has set up a "Go Fund Me" page to pay for his funeral........must have been a really successful trader. I tend to think he was just another self promoting Guru.  
I think "Islandfx911" is onto something with his thread so let's not pollute it with the likes of Rob Smith.

i saw the fuss about strat. he is not around anymore.  
curiosity got the better of me, so i did some looking around.  
i will only make this one post and no more, so do not post charts or discuss about his methods here.  
this is for broadening your knowledge's sake only that i want to direct you to.  
  
i think his students in the FF thread should be made aware and switch to his other method.  
i want to give him credit when credit is due.  
you can search in youtube and take a look at one of his student's video.  
[#TheStrat](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/thestrat) Basics. As easy as 1-2-3!  
this is price action reading, bar by bar.  
so much easier to understand than al brooks.

Hi Traders,  
Nothing really happened much for me with trades today, just a few break even trades.  
Tomorrow is a new day and new opportunities will be there for the taking.  
Just wanted to also thank you all for your posts, I look forward to reading them while waiting for the Asian session.  
  
Regards  
Rob

I have made two trades in London, one buy in GU which has come out in BE and I currently have an open sell in UJ.  
I made the entry at 15M based on what I saw in 4H previously.

I have plotted what would have been my entry candle and how I would set my SL from your third screenshot, with the assumption that your key levels were what I would have gotten via the weekly > daily > 4H >M30 drills adjusting the lines to better fit the lower time frames as you move your way down.  
  
Personally, I would note candles and SL zones on my chart, post them here and not enter if I didn't feel confident either in myself or the system. But with hindsight you can always revisit your candles and SL at the end of the day to see how it would have turned out. I think of this exercise as attempting a quiz to the best of my abilities and looking at the answer sheet later. Regardless of whether the entry would have moved in your favour, write down your justifications. Double check if your justifications match the concepts shared in earlier posts.  
  
The system is an easy to understand framework to identify entries with good probabilities of success, the risk/reward aspect take cares of the profitability over multiple trades over time. You have to first build your intuition and the confidence both in yourself and the system to take the trades when you see them.  
  
All the best!

Busy week this week so today I wasn't able to take a look at the charts during the asian sessions.  
  
Fired up the charts just now and this would have been a trade to take for XAUUSD during the London session based on the system. I did not enter the trade identified at the London session, but if I did i would do the following:  
  
1) Take partials (50% of position at 2021 key level @ 4.7x RR, and leave the remainder to run up to 7.5RR)  
2) Move stop loss to either 2021 key level (which would have been a stop out) or BE for the remainder (which will still be running now)  
  
It is currently the NY open so there could be an opportunity for a short re-entry at the 2021 key level.  
  
Update: London session entry runner would have been my first 7.5RR of the week, albeit at half the position.

Re-visited the AU to see if I had missed any trades, there would have been two entries, one during the Sydney session and another during the London session.  
  
Why did I lean towards buys? I looked at the ADR of AU prior to the weekend and both entries closed below the ADR low. That was what I gleaned from the charts and the additional confluence I used to support my hypothesis.  
  
Both entries despite valid would have been stop outs, but we take it on our chin and move on.

Hi L,  
When I start my trading day I have a good look at charts but I always remain neutral on direction. This is because you may not get a signal until the open.  
I will show you how I prepare charts.

As the day progresses you will have your levels established and ready to go.  
You can update the levels at key reversals through out the day.  
The important thing to take note of is ' How is price behaving prior to market open.  
Remember price gets pushed up and down prior to market opens to fill large positions.  
  
Some days you get easy setups some days not so clear, but you should always be able to find your trade.

Do you have an established rule for moving the stop to BE, e.g. when 1:1 is reached?

Hi N,  
There is only one answer for that.... Experience.  
I like to set and forget as I have been taken out at breakeven only to see my 7.5R TP reached.  
For now leave your SL at -1R and let the trade play out.  
The 7.5R will take care of the stop outs  
  
I was stopped out on UJ, however I got back in with two lots. I do not feel comfortable moving to B/E yet so the SL stays at -10 for now

I understand, thank you!  
It's one of the most complicated parts when operating looking for 7.5R. You know you are likely to have several stops before you reach it, but as old warren says: "The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient."

You will be surprised how fast they come in, market is just a bit tricky at the moment.  
There is nothing worse than missing a 7.5R trade, you will learn to accept the stop outs because the gains are so good. 

Your trade order needs to be in the right place at the right time.

Brought up a different pair to practice what you shared with a screenshot. While I understand what was shared, I'm slightly confused with regards to these points:  
  
\- How does the weekly > daily > 4hr > 30m charting process interweaves itself with the daily high low?   
Say I do the weekly > daily > 4hr > 30m, charting key levels before the start of a new week and do what you shared above before the start of each new day as the week progresses, do I keep my daily > 4hr > 30m levels charted prior to the start of the week, or are they "overwritten" by the fluid daily levels now that the week has begun and progressed.  
  
\- On remaining neutral on direction, say I looked at the price behaviour (slowly creeping upwards moving into the Sydney session's open), keeping in mind that price moves in manners that facilitates filling of large positions (pushing price up in order for huge sells, based on price behaviour prior to market open).  
  
"I would feel that looking price behaviour prior to market opens would provide me a bias in a particular direction, and now I'm just looking for an entry in that direction."  
  
Do you mean neutral to be more similar to a statement like this?   
  
"Although price has moved the way it did prior to market open, I am open to the market moving either way. Similar to what you have shared in an earlier post, if the market gives me a signal to sell, I sell and vice versa?"  
  
Ever grateful to you for taking the time to clarify doubts and misconceptions to keep us on the right track. Please rest if you have to, I would prefer not to keep you up during bedtime just to answer to questions and end up taking trades, I feel responsible for the outcome of the trade if it goes the other way ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f605.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f605.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f605.png?v=15.1)

Hi Yasmine91,  
thanks for your posts. Already you are understanding Islandfx911's method really well. I am not a teacher or mentor, but may I offer a couple of observations about your limit order? It's easy in hindsight, I know, but they say hindsight builds foresight...  
Anyway, I have drawn the support/resistance area on the 30 minute chart as I see it, using swing points to the left (see my charts attached).   
Also the lower wicks just before the large price drop have the effect of picking up dormant buy limit orders, thus consuming/eroding buyside liquidity that might otherwise prevent the large price drop that happened. Also, price dropped through the BRN (big round number) of 187.000, an important price level. Once through, it can be hard for price to get back above, again because of the way the MMs set up their orders defense levels.   
I wasn't at my charts at this time, so I can't say with any authority, but my order would have been at the last down red arrow.  
I hope this may have helped.

Very nice to see naked trading using line chart. Used to do that, always miss my entries because line doesnt involves any wick.

Hi Lt,  
Wicks are used with this system.  
Line chart for clarity of identifying swings and support and resistance, then a buy sell zone created by using wicks back to body.

Hi L,  
Answers below,  
  
How does the weekly > daily > 4hr > 30m charting process interweaves itself with the daily high lows? **I am not sure how to answer this question other than it is important to know key SR levels.**  
**I only do daily and 4hr then straight down to 30m. At 30 I look at levels close to the recent swings then plot buy / sell zones.**  
  
  
Say I do the weekly > daily > 4hr > 30m, charting key levels before the start of a new week and do what you shared above before the start of each new day as the week progresses, do I keep my daily > 4hr > 30m levels charted prior to the start of the week, **YES**  
  
or are they "overwritten" by the fluid daily levels now that the week has begun and progressed. **NO**  
  
\- On remaining neutral on direction, say I looked at the price behavior (slowly creeping upwards moving into the Sydney session's open), keeping in mind that price moves in manners that facilitates filling of large positions (pushing price up in order for huge sells, based on price behavior prior to market open).  
  
"I would feel that looking price behavior prior to market opens would provide me a bias in a particular direction, and now I'm just looking for an entry in that direction."  
  
Do you mean neutral to be more similar to a statement like this?  
  
"Although price has moved the way it did prior to market open, I am open to the market moving either way. Similar to what you have shared in an earlier post, if the market gives me a signal to sell, I sell and vice versa?" **Correct**  
  
**Always let me know if there is anything that needs clarification, sometimes I write when tired and it does not come across as it is meant to.**

GU Short trade I took yesterday utilizing price action from here, NITS, and The Strat. After weeks of consolidation/accumulation of orders, finally there was some good imbalances between buy & sell orders, with USD being bought and everything else being sold ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
As a 'reformed' (?) haha LTF scalper, this is all very new to me. But it seems refreshingly easier/less stress method of trading. I struggled to NOT look at M5/M1 charts though during the trade!  
Please let me know your thoughts. Open to learning more.  
Thanks

I do understand your technique. I understand it works, but it works perfectly on currencies. This i really agree. This technique works on less volatile pairs. So currencies are best to use this. I too apply a set of no indicator trading but it comes with different rules. Its a bit realistic rule, not a get rich method. But a slower growth but consistent growth. Though there is a high price to pay to use this method, but not in monetary value. But life values. 

Trading should be peaceful

Hi Islandfx,  
  
I have been keeping track of your method as there is similarity in price action analysis (highs and lows) with my trading approach. I also used limit orders to catch price retesting and rejecting from levels (Inthebox’s QM method, an old thread)   
  
You mentioned you need to wait for confirmation sometimes (wicks etc), do you also use stop orders and/or market price entries?  
  
The reason of asking is seeing you posted about your health, daily activities, and trade routines. And just a thought that since your entry rules are defined, maybe you can use alerts to help you. Your S/R levels, original SL/ wick levels, or wick itself (if you have clear defined rules around that), are plausible to be used as alerts. You can keep watching the market to see those happening, or an alert to let you know when it is happening. This is my current status to reduce chart time.  
  
take care and stay strong.

Hi T,  
Thanks for the advice.  
I use limit orders if the wick creates a SL > 10 Pts as 10 Pts is my max SL size.  
All other orders I enter at market.  
I am planning on just trading the Asian session from now on so I only spend 1.5hrs trading a day.  
I may look into alerts as it could work for me.  
Thanks again for your consideration  
  
Regards  
Rob

7.5R trades are a reality ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f3af.png?v=15.1)  
Stops will get hunted ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f629.png?v=15.1)  
  
I would just place set and forget trades. Leave SL at -1R and walk away.  
Congratulations for believing  
![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)

Hi J,  
I was long EJ at market open, I am out now. There were better choices.  
If it was me, I would cancel the order and watch this one to learn from it. This is what I would do I am not suggesting you do that.  
You are in control of your trades..

Hi K,  
  
Euro Session opened selling off AU. Have a look at Em's chart above it will give you some clues.

Hi Traders,  
To the new traders learning this system. Although this is my system I do not have all the answers to your questions.  
There are some traders here that are utilizing some or part of my trading system with there own.  
Some trading it 100% to the system rules.  
You will need to find what suits you and build on that.  
It will take time to see what I see, there is no rush.  
Do your homework, plan the trade. 

Your trade order needs to be in the right place at the right time.

I find it most effective in placing alerts. Though five is too little.

I see. There you have a very well defined criteria in wick size. Also there are already the price levels you have plotted on the chart.  
  
Besides alerts can keep track of the market for you, it can also be aiding your trade plan. For example, setting a “wick size >10pips” alert as you are waiting for it. You can be staying at the chart yourself, but the alert can do the calculation for you much faster should a wick >10 pips is formed.   
  
IMO, many say trading is a business. Then as a business owner, you can either do run it yourself as one-man-band, or set up a business system and hire people (tools) to work for you. It also does not defect your purpose of “no indicator” as they do not draw on the charts.  
  
trade well and take care

Hi Luckytujuh,  
  
Last post on alert unless Rob agrees.  
  
My solution is to code an alert with multiple conditions with alert(). For example,  
  
1\. if you need 6 price level alert on a pair, code a tool which it detects 6 price values. That is 1 tool, 1 alert on TV  
2\. if you want to monitor multiple pairs, code a monitor. It is also just 1 tool, 1 alert on TV  
3\. For Rob’s situation, also can integrate the Price Level and wick size >10pips into one alert tool, also 1 tool 1 alert on TV  
  
The alert () also allows customisation of notification text, such as “price hit 3rd level”, or “XAUUSD meets condition” even with multiple trigger conditions  
  
same for MT4/5

there is no such limits in MT4/MT5.  
  
there are multiple alerts you can code in mql4/mql5  
  
you need a professional coder for your trading business not any hobby programmer.

I know there are no limits in mt4/5 but that applies for pc only. But for mobile. Mt5 hasnt introduced any possibilites of ea. So when u are always outside. U dont want to be like watching the phone all the time.

You need someone that can make what you need, and that person can be yourself. You certainly don't need a "professional coder" to make a couple of indicators or EAs.

Keeping it short today with a short ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) Currently running  
  
Update: Added another AU entry, SL using what was shared on post #698  
  
Update 2: stopped out on gold but we don’t sweat because we bagged a 7.5R on AU, took 50% partials and left the runner to the daily swing resistance marked in yellow which I took another 30%, remaining 20% to TP at the 4hr key level marked in pink. SL shifted to 7.5R for runners

I put a comparison of what approach I use to trade with a line chart of the OP.  
Need more work my end to appreciate and gain confidence in setting out levels on a line chart but well worth it I feel. Just my thoughts on a work in progress for me.   
Price seems to bounce off the level or turn ( not every time of course) but the area always has your attention in case of reactions.  
It's the OP's way of drawing levels that interest me. If I have made a mistake let me know. If my post is not in accordance with this thread I will cease posting.  
Anyway - great thread and food for thought.

Hi T,  
I have replicated your chart and to be brutally honest it looks like spaghetti. I don't know how you could get a reliable entry.  
I take it you are looking at a close above or below moving averages for entries.  
I really think you could benefit by stripping away the MA's and focus on levels.  
Take a look at the charts below. I struggle to see how you trade your chart.

m1 is not for just any traders. it is a very high risk trade.  
no need for MA to tell me the direction.  
the H1 chart already telling the direction way before the MA turned down.

Waiting to pull the trigger on a UJ short, watching candle closely as we are 5 minutes away from NY open.  
  
Reminder to not be impatient if the setup is not there, we wait for the market to come to our price. Not select a price and hope the market goes to it, no one can tell what the market will do  
  
Update: trade is running  
Update 2: shifted SL to BE for UJ short, reasoning provided on second follow up chart  
Update 3: UJ short exited at BE, still watching the pair should any opportunities present itself.  
  
Rob, I hope you don't mind me showing the indicator for the trading sessions. I'm using it to make my plotting of previous day's high/lows more efficient. Will remove it in future charts if you do mind. Was doing manually by setting vertical lines as you can see on the day before.  
  
Recommend newer readers of the thread to at least practice doing it without any aids first before relying on indicators to learn and understand better. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

I have a few things to say about this trade, but I will wait till the 90minute period has past and update this post in due time.  
  
**Update on UJ short:**  
**A few pointers:**  
  
1) **Shifting of SL to BE**  
As you can see in the second picture, the price _**came up to hunt for stop losses.**_ This was shared in an earlier post by Rob where there were many times because of shifting SLs to BE, he missed a good trade, this is a very good example. Trade would have been fine if I left my SL as is, I made an error on the app where I place my trade instead of entering $0 for my stop loss, _**I actually unchecked the checkbox for SL (open SL)**_ Please do not commit the same mistake as me. It worked out in the end but it could have easily been a disaster (potential wipe of account with margin call). While the trade worked out in the end and I discovered the open SL in time, I can't say that this is a trade I am proud of in terms of the execution.  
  
2) **Do not rush your trades**.  
I could have also entered the trade on the second candle which is in my opinion a much better entry candle than the first and avoided all that anxiety from the first. Retests can provide you with further confidence that the setup is a good one (think double/ triple tops).  
  
3) **I could have split my entries.**  
Fear of missing out was what drove me to enter at the open thinking what if there was no retest to re-enter? I could have split my position, assume i were to risk 1% for the entry. I could have entered 0.5% to keep my FOMO in check. If the re-test does come, I then enter again with another 0.5%. You can split your entries how you like ~0.33% for 3 entries so on so forth.  
_______________________________________________________  
  
Spotted another trade (AU-short, screenshot 1) that you can consider, wait till the candle closes before you enter. The new candle is a much better rejection candle compared to the first. Personally, I would not expect the trade to be one that you can push out the TP level too much because of the prev day high, today's low and the 4hr support all acting as potential resistance. Additionally, the trade has been ranging in a pretty tight zone prior.  
  
Best to take some partial profits along the way at the levels mentioned above if you do take this trade.  
  
**Update on AU short:**  
I am glad I have two examples on the same session sharing the same reflections, points stated above all could have been applied to the AU short (screenshot 3). I have to admit that I did feel the temptation to shift my SL to BE at the candle marked in green, but then I remembered what happened on the UJ trade... The chart also provided three points of entry, but as shared initially this trade is not one I would think that the TP could be pushed out in the short term, reasons were already provided initially.  
  
I also entered gold on a short but was stopped out (see screenshot 4), not much to say except that it shared similar traits to the AU short so I would have taken partials along the way as well. Currently both my UJ and AU trades are running with some partial profits taken already but man what a sweaty session this is for me.  
  
I tried to post potential entries and pen down my thought processes as the session progressed to journal my thoughts as the candles came along. The intention is not to provide signals for readers to act on, but rather more of a "pseudo real-time" journal of someone trying to apply what was shared in this thread.  
  
Having to manage looking for entries, already entered trades and posting in a timely fashion is currently too taxing for me. Nonetheless, this was a very good learning experience and I hope there is something for readers to take away both good and bad.  
  
I will still post my charts moving forward but I'll probably do a recap after the session or the day instead of the current format.

Hi - your comments are welcome.  
I have no problem trading my charts ( "Roadmap" - Laura's thread on FF) but I was looking for snippets to improve my understanding of price action. I use levels and times and consolidations etc, approaches gleaned from "The flying Dutchman etc" but the core is "Roadmap" thread. I will continue to study and use your level approach using line charts but will cease to post here to avoid confusion and digression from your approach and related dialogue. You have a great thread Island and, with your permission , I will pop in and study more of your evolving content. Excellent thread - and there aren't many of those![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Not wishing to divert this thread by asides but, yes, I use levels, time and higher time frames ( 15;5; and 1 for execution) but, as I repeated above, "Roadmap" is my core and trades were executed this morning around Islands Dax level via a channel break ( as per laura's thread). All good stuff here but I will desist from posting because it digresses from Islands core approach ( because I was after adapting my approach by incorporating elements of Islands)  
Great thread.

Like this one the most, exited gold on a small profit since the pairs are correlated and I like this over the gold entry.

it's a matter of gaining enough experience to trust the method fully.  
if you reaches a 70% win rate then everyday just do and repeat the same thing.  
even if it is 40/50% win rate you still win at the end of the week because of the RR.

Yes, with the RR from the system, the win rate is not too big of an issue. Will have to put in the work and time to slowly understand how do discern the hares from the tortoises.

no need to be at computer whole day.  
total focus to discern only half an hour before any markets open.  
you only need the volume to move the market.

Yes, don't have the time to be at the computer the whole day as well, in the midst of a yearly commitment all Singaporean sons know too well... Only have the time to look at the markets during London and NY session

Hi folks, been a lurker here for a while. Just wanted to drop a big 'thank you' to you Island for the effort you've put in to your system and generosity for sharing it.  
I've been in forex for about a year now trying to take every shortcut to make profits, bouncing around different strats etc, and managed to lose a lot of money in the process. After finding this thread last week and placing some decent trades I honestly felt for the first time that I understood the process of what I was doing and had faith and confidence in my (limited!) knowledge, I don't wanna jump the gun but I really think this could be my 'A-ha' moment. Of course, I started this week with some proper over confidence and got a good spanking from the market but yesterday and today I've been back on track, just gotta keep my focus and not think of the results.  
So once again, thanks Island, if I can maintain these results I can't even begin to explain to you what you have given to me and my family.  
  
Some trades I took today:

Hi - your comments are welcome.  
I have no problem trading my charts ( "Roadmap" - Laura's thread on FF) but I was looking for snippets to improve my understanding of price action. I use levels and times and consolidations etc, approaches gleaned from "The flying Dutchman etc" but the core is "Roadmap" thread. I will continue to study and use your level approach using line charts but will cease to post here to avoid confusion and digression from your approach and related dialogue. You have a great thread Island and, with your permission , I will pop in and study more of your evolving content. Excellent thread - and there aren't many of those![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Great work L,  
This is how all traders should think / plan. Give yourself options for trades. Know where price **could** go and be prepared for it.  
As with Em, always set up on the weekend ready to start reaping in the $. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)  
It takes more to be a trader than thinking you are.  
Get off your butts and dig your heels in.  
Lets all have a great week and make some $  
I encourage you to post charts and questions, it is the only way to learn.

Hi Island,  
I wanted to ask you something. I am plotting TP target 1, at the nearest peak/trough averaging 2-3R. I'm finding price would hit target 1 then come back to stop out or BE. I wondered if there were anything that helps you with plotting TP further away.  
I’ve read in one of your posts that it takes time to spot the runners, also the post regarding pushing TP out.  
I wondered if plotting a TP further away had anything to do with possibly weekly levels, or anything else. Or you mentioned you should be able to place a trade and forget about it, would you plot 7.5R no matter what and if you get a feeling price isn’t going there exit early? Thank you

Hi M,  
There is nothing wrong with taking 2 -3R if you are getting a very high win rate.  
At the end of the day trading is about making money.  
I will often adjust the TP to within support or resistance so my TP is reached.  
Sometimes you have watch a 2R or 3R trade turn into a losing trade before it continues to the 7.5R TP (Painful but necessary) but after you get some 7.5R winners and you look at the $ gain win compared to the SL $ you will learn to ride these trades out the distance.  
Also runners are not 7.5R they are 15, 20,30+ Pts and can go for days. You have to be very trend aware for this.  
I like trading the Asian session because the ADR will be low, this gives me an advantage of having my trade reach 7.5R TP  
Lets use EA as an example, the market has opened and the current ADR is 45Pts (That how much it has moved since open)  
Lets say I get a signal that requires an 8Pt SL which means I need a 60pts TP (7.5R)  
The 10 Day ADR is 108Pts I therefore know I have a chance of getting a 7.5R TP  
If the market has moved 60 or 70 Pts before I get a signal the chances are less of getting 7.5R  
So ADR is important to watch.  
Next using ADR in your favor.  
EA has moved 120Pts up and Euro session is about to open, are you going to buy EA?  
You should be looking for shorts in this situation.  
  
You have to understand the principle of the 7.5R TP and how it came about and then you may have your question answered.  
The calculation of 7.5R is based on the individual pair, daily range, average wick size and few special herbs and ingredients. It took a long time to work out but it works if you get the right entry.  
All I can say is stick with it, become a 7.5R trader and be aware.  
  
Apologies if my answer is a bit fragmented, Hospital drugs still in my system. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f92a.png?v=15.1) I will review in the morning.

R:R of 1:2 will not help to come out in profit if you have a really really bad entry criteria.  
For a positive outcome you need to have a decent entry as well.

A primer on ADR for those who are not familiar with it, yes you can use an indicator to do this for you but I think it is helpful to understand how it works. With that you will also gain an understanding of what tweaking the parameters does.  
  
Daily Range = Daily High - Daily Low  
X Day ADR = Sum of previous X days daily ranges / X  
10 day ADR = Sum of previous 10 days daily ranges / 10  
  
SMA vs EMA:  
  
Simple Moving Average (SMA): Means that if your ADR has a period of ten days, each day contributes an equal weightage (10%) in the ADR calculation  
  
Exponential Moving Average (EMA): Means that if your ADR has a period of ten days, the most recent day (yesterday, t-1) has the highest weightage, and each less recent day(t-2, t-3.... t-10) contributes a decreasing weightage in the ADR calculation.  
For the layman, it means the more recent days matter more, the less recent days matter less.  
  
Which to select (SMA or EMA) for your ADR calculation is personal preference.  
  
Note:  
  
1\. Daily range encompasses all trading sessions (Sydney + Tokyo + London + New York)  
  
2\. Each particular pair has it's own set of distributions as to which sessions contribute more or less of the movement in a day.  
  
3\. 80% of the time, an instrument trades WITHIN it's 20 day ADR, the remaining 20% of the time it trades beyond the ADR  
  
Source for statistic (3): [https://www.litefinance.org/blog/for...verage%20value](https://www.litefinance.org/blog/for-beginners/best-technical-indicators/average-daily-range-adr-technical-indicator/#:~:text=The%20ADR%20indicator%20calculates%20the,periods%2C%20determining%20the%20average%20value)  
  
On next day's open, the +/- of the ADR value will be the supposed range of possible movement.  
  
There is no guarantee that it will always stay within the ADR, trading is probabilistic. But if you happen to see a pair trading beyond the high for example, and see a valid set up from the system for a short or vice versa, you can be sure I will be entering that short every single time.  
  
I have attached some helper screenshots for reference. Timeframe is daily.  
  
ADR is just one additional point of information to include in your charting for determining how much room there is for a pair to move, some additional points I look at that you may consider are:  
  
\- Session Hi /Lo  
\- Areas of potential support/ resistance in LTFs  
  
Honestly, there are trades where I entered on a valid setup, but just entered 7.5R as my TP and pray for the best (not the wisest move), resulting in SLs or BEs where I could have taken a 4,5,6R profit and be happily in profit. I'm learning along the way as well, and have some practical position management tips on post #727 update 2, #744 point 3 on splitting your entries you may consider to avoid leaving too much on the table while ensuring you are taking as much profit as you can.

Hi FX,  
In your statement you have just created a negative belief about EA. Your belief is that it is not the right timing and trading will be light due to the holiday. This can be detrimental to trading this system.  
My belief is there is a valid signal, take the trade, the outcome will be whatever it will be. 

Your trade order needs to be in the right place at the right time.

Hello Island and fellow traders, this is a super cool thread with gold nuggets everywhere!! Thank you for sharing your knowledge!! I have just finished reading all 40 pages and ready to start the posting stage.  
  
Someone mentioned to me in my trading journey, you don't trade the markets... you trade your beliefs of the market.

Would this be correct? there is an impulse move through support followed by a retest and rejection.

This is the trade I am currently in.  
I did not get the chance to go to breakeven on my EA trade this morning so took the 1R loss.  
I have locked in some profit on the move south.

Hi D,  
I would not take this trade the impulse move is a bit over stretched and heading into a support zone. Keep looking and you will find better set ups.

Support and resistance behave different in trends and ranging markets. they can gets smashed during trends and have strong resilience when market is ranging.  
There should be no being 'worried' when trading. Just find the set up, place the trade and let the market do what it does. We have no control over price, support or resistance. When you accept you are not in control and anything can happen you will become a better trader.

the impulse move **into the London open** before the signal was for me important.

Hi C76,  
If it was in the market open times, yes. I am just looking for rejections of S/R

Hi Island,  
  
good trade as always! When you are not at the PC you can use mobile to execute trades (Move SL for instance),  
I only trade with phones.  
  
BTW just for fun I made a TradingView tool for a 1 price level and/or wick >10pips integrated alert. Very crude but validated in real time. If you wish to try you can let me know.  
  
Both tips work on phone and PC and they should improve your quality of life when trading.  
  
Happy Chinese New Year and greetings from Hong Kong/Taiwan

Based on yesterday's market prices, this is the current price level. The question is whether these positions could be considered good options for making a trade.

Bagged a 7.5R with a GU long during today's Tokyo session, just exited the trade.  
  
Note that this isn't an ideal pair to look at during the Asian session, but how the setup was identified is a good example for learning

Hi Traders,  
Just wanted to let you all know I have asked lolxhaha to look after this thread. He has shown the qualities needed to trade and teach my system.  
His charts are easy to understand and you will learn all you need from them to master this system. 7.5R works, believe in this and you will become very wealthy, but always remember health is wealth and always put your family first. My short visit to the hospital a few days ago shortened the time I have left so don't be surprised if I stop posting one day. I will still post while I can.  
  
Thanks lolxhaha for your help, keep up the good work ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)

Knowing when to break the rules. I hopped on the rides south with EU before market open as I could see the rejection candle was forming.  
This you will get with experience.

The previous entry proved to be satisfactory, resulting in a yield of over 60 pips. The current question is whether this presents another viable opportunity to place a limit order.

i got a question. In my previous post i saw a m30 short setup on GJ (hope is valid). Here we got a m15 long setup on EJ.   
  
I think these charts should normaly correlate positive. Now we have conflicting signals. How do you decide which to take? Do you take both? Do you let them go?   
Or am i too lazy with choosing the setups?   
  
Ty in advance!

when unclear in lower time frames direction, consult higher time frame direction.

> Hi Traders, Just wanted to let you all know I have asked lolxhaha to look after this thread. He has shown the qualities needed to trade and teach my system. His charts are easy to understand and you will learn all you need from them to master this system. 7.5R works, believe in this and you will become very wealthy, but always remember health is wealth and always put your family first. My short visit to the hospital a few days ago shortened the time I have left so don't be surprised if I stop posting one day. I will still post while I can. Thanks...

Dear Rob,  
I discovered your thread just a few weeks ago, and your "No Indicator Trading System" was exactly what I was looking for. I already had a similar idea in my mind, but I still lacked a clear definition of the parameters and implementation. Although I am still on the way to becoming a profitable trader, your tips have helped me a lot. I am all the more moved and sad to hear about your poor health. I would have very much wished that you could have accompanied and supported us for many more years.  
I would like to sincerely thank you for your support and sharing your strategy, and I wish you only the very best for your health and well-being.  
Sincerely,  
Gerd

When in doubt zoom out (HTF), if still in doubt, sit out.  
  
Sometimes you see zones at M15, but when you move back to M30 the zone isn't there. I would say that you should still base your entries on M30 (recall the D1 > H4 > M30 exercise) and only look at M15 if the SL presented is too big for your risk tolerance. Personally I do not go any lower than M15 for my entries.  
  
Alignment across timeframes is key part to the system shared, here's a helper chart Rob (IslandFX911) shared in an earlier post, always ask yourself where is the 1-2-3 in your charts. Only looking for entries at 3 is enough, notice how 3 is always a trend continuation.

What time zone is this ?  
And is the set up just prior to, or just after market open ( not in middle of session for example)?

are you going to trade all the sr you can find during the whole day. sure you can do that. but what are your chances of winning?  
big brother said trade at the red and blue zone. then you go down to m30. 2 trades are all you need.

We welcome stupid questions because everyone learns from it, let's play out your assumption and see if it holds.  
  
Assume you did not mark off your weekly daily H4 etc S/R levels and you fired your charts up and waited for "simple little S/R levels to be broken and retested", now you have entered a trade. We do not know what the markets will do, nobody does.  
  
You have these questions to consider:  
What is my SL if the trade goes against me?  
Where do I TP if the trade goes in my direction?  
If it does go in my direction, how far can I push my trade out? 2R? 3R? 4R? (insert some)R?  
  
If you do not have answers to these questions, where do you look for them?  
  
Not having any clear and defined answers to the above questions before entering a trade is akin to treating the market like a casino, you are effectively gambling and we know what happens to all gamblers in the long run.  
  
Say if you were profitable with this approach, how much of your profit would be eaten away by fees? Will you still be profitable after accounting for the cost of doing business? Even if you are profitable, even a $0.01 over a day, a week, a month, a year is profitable, did this endeavour suggest a good use of your time?  
  
  
This is not a spray and pray, but rather a take aim, account for wind/elevation, hold your breath, before shooting your shot at your target.  
Would you hunt for deers in bad weather/ when it is moving/ in a place where you cannot properly take aim? Or would you find a good spot with a good vantage point, in clear weather, when the deer is drinking water from a lake and is stationary?  
  
Compare the two scenarios and consider how many rounds would you expect to use trying to hunt for one, remember that your ammo is also a cost that you have to factor in when you are hunting.  
  
Doing the higher timeframe drill down to lower timeframes is very necessary as it gives you a clear idea on what your answers will be for the questions stated above. Prep work exists for a reason, and initially it seems like a lot of work but trust me it gets easier over time if you do it often and do it with focus.  
  
This thread "teaches you how to be a successful hunter (in the markets), from when to pull the trigger (entries) and where are the best spots to find deer (price level)", and is written by one who spent large amounts of time figuring out what works and what doesn't. If it is included as part of the teachings then it is there for a reason.

in case people get it wrong. big brother is not me.  
they are the higher time frames that support the direction.  
sure sometimes they themselves have conflicts and arguments.  
when they are all in alignment, all systems go.  
h4 = big brother  
d1 = father  
w1 = grand father  
mn = great grand father

Hi Detto,  
  
just my 2 cents, from reading posts from this thread and my way of trading. I only analyse charts at entry timeframe.  
  
The strategy starts with marking S/R levels from higher time frame to entry timeframe, adding and adjusting levels when scaling down.   
  
so if picking levels only at entry timeframe, just go with the end points of swings (HH /LL), and strong S/R. Most likely these levels are seen on other timeframes.  
  
Here are charts with the pending limit order entry method.  
  
Buy setup at previous Lower Low rejection area

Sell setup at persistent S/R, note that the same level can be plotted on higher time frame.

Currently, these are the support and resistance levels. Should I wait for a breakout and retracement? One interesting question arises: which lines have more prominence, the M30 or the H4? When there are numerous lines, which one will the price react to?

It is much simpler what the OP Islandfx911 explained in his posts.  
  
GU H4 zoom down from Weekly to Daily and to H4  
  
then on the H1 trading timeframe see the rejection candle with small SL and the 7.5R trade

Where was your SL?   
That wick above the shaded rectangle should have stopped you out.

Took a EU Short. Convictions for the trade annotated on the chart.  
  
P.S: Had to amend the colour for the short position box and the position of the 1-2-3 due to the wicks / colour on the line chart  
  
Update: Trade got stopped out, will come back to review if we got stopped due to a stop hunt

wait for the rejection pull-back candle to close than enter on the next candle open

Only problem is the UK market wasn't open yet.  
Don't we wait for UK market to open first before trading the GBP?

as a trader, you should know what gbp event drove gu to drop.  
it is also the europe/frankfurt open.  
some traders only trade those moments.  
while most avoid it totally.  
so do not be surprised if you do not see any real trades been shown here for the GDP news.

if at all, i would have only taken this buy signal at GU today after IM (impulsemove).  
  
however, i would have rather waited for a better price, close to the pink buy zone.

Was this a valid entry? The H4 lines appear to be more prominent than the M30 lines, so it seems like I'll stick to them as I'm still learning the ropes. Whenever the M30 lines are drawn, there is always a question regarding which line price will react to.

why not sell?  
we have to know that the trade we take is a A+ trade.  
because many others are also learning.  
whether it is the right thing to learn or not.  
but trading on a single horizontal line without careful analysis can be a 50/50 chance of winning and losing.  
it can be buy and it can also be a sell as shown in the m1 chart.  
it is correct that this is a buy zone. why?  
the answer can be found in the first 22 posts.  
do we have the eagle eyes to pick out the 3 points to note before placing of trades?

Previous sell zones (drawn in red) can become buy zones (drawn in blue) as it was respected on the movement down, I have annotated over your original chart which could have provided a sharper entry if we entered on the subsequent bearish rejection over the one you marked with the blue upward arrow than your original box in purple . Do keep in mind that we dislike pinbars/ hammers because the SL needed to trade them are usually large as the wick is further away from the zone.

Hi Lolxhaha,  
  
Happy belated Chinese New Year.   
  
From his previous posts and charts, Island also uses Limit Order when wick is >10 pips. But in this case it would be same outcome as your analysis, the entry would be at 2nd candle.

I am planning on just trading the Asian session from now on so I only spend 1.5hrs trading a day. I may look into alerts as it could work for me. Thanks again for your consideration Regards Rob

@tommydog....  
  
You limit your view to those charts posted and what you see ...   
  
You should look at your own independent charts. This way you will see the Daily and H4 SnR levels much clearer and the storyline. After he two previous day 4Hr impulse candle move down, what do you see on your chart zoom out further .  
  
If there is no trade setup that fits the method taught by Islandfx911 then simply there is not trade.   
  
No matter how much hindsight after-the-fact analysis will do you any good in learning this method.  
  
Other trading methods may show up possible setup ... for example Rob Smith' 2-1-3-2 is a price Action setup and you wont need a 10pips SL. You will still get a -1R SL and +5R profit

How do you approach trading at resistance levels? I recently took a trade and positioned the stop loss just below the latest H4 support level. Now, I am closely monitoring the progress of the trade and eagerly observing its reaction to the support and resistance levels.

An interesting visual can be produced by using the 1 MA ... if you have the indicator MA In Color by FXSniper and Robert Hill  
Use it for your Line Chart 1 MA as mentioned above and set its 3 different colors.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f438.png?v=15.1)

hi Rob  
  
Good to see your post.  
  
I have closed many trades but none of them 7.5R. Only a few average ~3.8R overall +9.9%.  
  
On you chart, I I start with Daily SnR, then 4H Snr, and H1 Snr,  
I see your setup was near where the most recent 4Hr Snr and H1 SnR were,  
  
the question is which candle is the rejection candle.  
I think most people here have problem with the rejection candle concept.

for more than 30 years ago I learned to trade the line chart but tehn I only trade the Daily charts.  
  
slowly things evolve with more timeframes and swing levels SnR   
Monthly is Violet   
Weekly is Orange   
Daily is Red  
H4 is Green  
H1 is Blue  
  
and then years later came Rob Smith' jargon with candlesticks and I tried blending all these when I read my charts.... my head is like a 'spinning top' ...  
  
and on lower timeframe like this M15 below, I see the Daily, H4 and H1 swing level SnR, while the Weekly Snr are farther away.

i like it very much, this is an important part of my intraday approach;-) thx emmanuel for this good input  
  
  
  
by the way, i would like to recommend the profit factor to everyone here.  
  
with this you can check the robustness of your system or trading regardless of the percentages, loss days and R:R.  
  
i would say roughly everything above two is very good and you are on the right track in the **long term**. above 3 is sensational;-) 

trading is like dancing, don't think and just listen to the music!

London Session opens in about 15 minutes, have spotted a potential entry for Gold. One that has alignment across HTFs -> LTFs. Will not be jumping the gun and only enter upon candle close.

Hi Em,  
  
1st trade SL hit.  
If a blue bullish candle rejects resistance, that is the signal. The opposite for bearish.

Hello,  
I was reading through the thread and hoped somebody could help me better understand this.  
I understand the 123 pattern, I am however a little confused – unless I’ve understood incorrectly, I thought part of the system was, some trades as well as the 123 are valid when price is hitting what was support and now treating it as resistance (so long as within correct times, price has been going up prior to market open, and have rejection candle to sell) but doesn’t always show as a 123 pattern, for example post 290, 400, 451, 568  
Thankyou

For those on tradingview, you can get something similar.  
  
(1) Click the (+) button on the top left of your tradingview window.  
(2) Enter the same symbol as your current chart, make sure to select the same broker as the one on your current chart.  
(3) Hover over the result you identified from step 2, click on new pane.  
  
Make any adjustments based on your preference.  
  
This is particularly useful for those who aren't trading on multiple monitors or wish to be able to see both line /candle charts without resorting to multiple tabs on your browsers.  
  
3rd screenshot is the final result

"doesn’t always show as a 123 pattern" I believe this is a misconception. The 1-2-3 is essentially what the system is trying to trade (see post #51)  
  
All the other factors helps to push the probability of success in our favour:

  1. "support and now treating it as resistance" and vice versa is we use to identify the 1-2-3.
  2. "within correct times" ensures that our entry at 3 is supported with good volume
  3. "price has been going up prior to market open", this is not gospel, but it is common knowledge that in order for big orders to fill (from institutions), there needs to be enough liquidity (volume), hence there will be instances when they have to push prices up in order to have that liquidity to push it down or the other way around. We look at what is happening prior to session open because most of the volume is coming in during the first ~90 mins of session's open.
  4. "rejection candle to sell" and vice versa is confirmation that the zone we are looking to enter at 3 is valid, before we enter a trade

I hope this clarifies ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Not sure if you meant post #292, as 290 wasn't associated with a chart (see first screenshot)  
  
Post #400, annotated on the charts given on the post (second screenshot)  
You can also view both the moves as one giant 1-2-3 (third screenshot)  
  
With what you know now from post #292 and #400, try to use #451 and #568 as practice. Plot your 1-2-3s on the charts from those posts and reply to this post.

i have the candle chart here. are you referring to this?  
for me the resistant zone originated from the previous day, or it could even be 3 days before.  
where do we draw the line on how to use it?  
it is a matter of personal choice whether to take the 123 pattern as valid or not.  
for me, i would prefer the see the current market price to form the 123 pattern.  
there is only one valid red arrow sell pattern.

Ah, it appears that now is the opportune moment to eagerly anticipate a retracement towards the H4 resistance line, which will eventually pave the way for us to gracefully position a limit order.

there is no matching direction to the higher time frame during the london session.  
wait for the next market open and usd ppi, then the nyse open.

hi @Mellifluous  
  
The candlesticks reading of 123 pattern is different from the way line charts swing points are interpreted.  
Different trading guru teach different things how they read their charts.  
For example, naked trader like Joe Ross for example, he read the 123 using candlesticks.  
There are other trading gurus like Rob Smiths with his own candle number 1, 2, 3 which is totally different.  
Then we have many gurus with different variations of the Malaysian SnR .

All credit goes to Rob, for his system that is easy to pick up and apply, to you and the other seniors of the forum who actively contributed and spent precious time to post your charts and clarifying my doubts, and quickly point out any mistakes I have made to prevent them turning into bad habits further down the line.  
  
I'm relatively new to trading, so a system that is simple enough for an inexperienced "trader" like me to understand and iterate with practice really is one that checks many of my boxes. The me 1 year ago going through Babypips would never have thought all this is possible.   
  
Rob mentioned that the system can turn $5000 into a million in a year some post back. I do not doubt his conviction in his system, but I'm going to take it a week at a time. The S&P index returns 10% annualised returns YoY for reference, even turning $5000 into $10,000 is very good progress (100% in a year).  
  
As the saying goes, "_Rome wasn't built_ in a _day_ ".

Hi Traders,  
You have made me proud this week. I am starting to see you changing your belief structure to what**is** possible.  
Remember to help not criticize each other. We are all so different yet seeking the same goal.  
You are in charge, not the market, not the pro's.  
Be prepared before you place any trade. You decide your entry, SL and exit based on the system and your beliefs.  
  
Some info for you....

Rob has his reasons and motivation when he said that. Everyone needs his own reasons and motivation. We are not the same.  
  
YES. start with $5000 and first turn that to $10,000 ... there is no pressure to make that in one year. It all depends on the market conditions.   
  
From $10,000 to $50,000 is the next milestone .  
  
Next, from $50,000 to $500,000 in 36-months cycle.... my latest challenge I gave myself. Learn when to "Cut-Losses-Short" and "Let Profits Run".

Hi Traders,  
I would like at this moment to thank Em ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1) for the contributions to this thread. Always best to keep your feet firmly on the ground.  
I made 536% one year and thought I could better it the following year. That following year I made 88%. You just don't know what is going to happen.  
If you follow the system correctly the money will follow.  
Everyone here is in a different financial situation and a different age.  
Slow and steady wins the race, if you make 10% a month and compound it you will become very wealthy.  
There is no rush and you won't go wrong following Em's advice on $ statistics.  
Trade well. 

Your trade order needs to be in the right place at the right time.

Hi lolxhaha,  
  
Wish you all the best. In my 4th month trading I came across InTheBox's price actions strategy (Over and Under / QM), he is a very good price action trader and have similarity with this method of Island's. I used this price action with limit orders (very close to how Island uses limit orders), but I then moved on to add 1 confirmation signal to better convert into an alert based trading system (TMS).  
  
You are in a good start so I believe you can have a good account growth soon. Success starts from not failing. I think you are in very good start line compared with many traders who suffer from years of losing money and learn the hard way.  
  
Now you have a good strategy, 2 cents on working on account growth.  
  
1\. **Risk-based management** \- My personality is towards capital protection. I developed ways on how to control risk and risk of ruin. The first step is to prevent your account size go below deposit (i.e. first goal is not to lose a cent to the market). Focus on your risk first, then to step 2  
  
2\. **Achieving a consistent ROI** \- Your trading will accumulate into meaningful statistics. Instead of a fixed $ or % growth, I would suggest going with %gain/%risk, like Profit Factor calculation. This information is independent of your account size/deposit, etc, and is truly assessing your trading performance. This is useful in finding out strategy based information such as alpha decay and consistency.  
  
3\. **Earning a % / $ and scaling up** \- The ROI converts to actual profit $ based on your risk and account size. Once you have a consistent performance and you decided the risk management model, then scaling up account growth will simply based on risk per trade and account size.  
  
I started with $2000, then $4000, then $25000 as deposit. Now is prop firm + personal account of $14k with capital from previous profit. This is a good evidence to myself that it can be done within 3 years. I believe you can do that or even better.  
  
Good work.

Hi Traders,  
I don't claim that I can tell the future but do any of you remember this post 649? (11 Days ago)  
All I did was sit down on the weekend and prepare my charts for market open.  
Take a look at AU.  
Trading does not get any clearer or simpler than this. There are pages and pages of posts that use indicators that won't give you an edge over the market.  
I don't often get pissed very easily but don't let this knowledge I have shared go to waste.  
Get you're arse off the sofa get planning for the week and show me I did not waste my precious time here.  
For those making the effort, well done. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)

Hi Traders,  
AU for the start of this coming week.  
If anyone is serious about 'Trading Without Indicators' now is the time to standup and get some charts on this thread marked up with your buy / sell zones for market open.  
There is another trader from the UK I have recently trained in this system coming to this thread soon to assist lolxhaha.  
Make an effort and you will get assistance from these guys.  
If I can do it half dead, you should be able to do it with your eyes closed.  
Go to the inthebox thread and learn all you can from there ITB is another trader that understands the big picture. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)

Thank you Tommy for your well wishes, and for sharing your personal journey in trading and thoughts on risk management. I am still in the midst of figuring out my personality for risk management and much of what you shared for point (1) resonates with me. I have always wondered what does profit factor mean as it is a metric that is available for my trading account. As a better objective measure of trading performance, I have since opened a separate trading account funnelling what I have gained from trading Rob's system as well as a small capital so it doesn't get muddied by other trades I have taken prior to learning the system. I have been advised by other traders to take up prop firms both as a personal challenge as well as a way to gain access to more capital once you have found your edge, at this point I don't think I am ready for that but I have it in my sights further down the line.  
  
Thinking risk first before profits is a piece of advice I have heard from many other traders both on FF and off. Profits tend to take care of themselves once you have zero-ed in on risk, so that is also the main takeaway I got from your sharing. Best of luck to you and your trades, wishing you and all other traders a prosperous 2024, I hope we can look back at this post again towards the end of the year and do a review for this year ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Hi Traders,  
Please respect my wishes.  
No further talk about prop firms, indicators or risk, this is a distraction to those here to teach and assist you in learning this system.  
You are wasting their time when they could be helping some one asking the right questions.  
What **should** you be focusing on?  
Lets start the week by blowing out the old trading cobwebs / concepts out of your heads and start trading this system.  
Forget about the money / trade size / risk, it is nobody's business but yours.  
Trade with money that means nothing to you. if you hold a moneytary value on the funds you have placed on a trade you have already failed.  
If you cannot use this system to change your financial situation for the better with your own funds, be it a $200 start or $200k start you might as well close the computer down now. 

Your trade order needs to be in the right place at the right time.

In my 4th month trading I came across InTheBox's price actions strategy (Over and Under / QM), he is a very good price action trader and have similarity with this method of Island's. I used this price action with limit orders (very close to how Island uses limit orders), but I then moved on to add 1 confirmation signal to better convert into an alert based trading system (TMS). You are in a good start so I believe you can have a good account growth soon. Success starts from not failing. I think you are...

Hi Tommy,  
I appreciate your interest in this thread, however can you refrain from discussing account sizes, prop firms etc.  
There are traders here that are new to trading and I want them focused.  
I am okay with you posting your trades relating to this system or ITB system here, I am interested in seeing them.  
You are trader that has knowledge of value to readers of this thread.  
Maybe share and help others if you have time on any given day.  
Kind Regards  
Rob 

Your trade order needs to be in the right place at the right time.

[quote=Islandfx911;14760005]Bonjour Traders, AU pour le début de la semaine à venir. Si quelqu'un souhaite sérieusement « trader sans indicateurs », il est maintenant temps de se lever et d'obtenir des graphiques sur ce fil balisés avec vos zones d'achat/vente pour l'ouverture du marché. Il y a un autre commerçant du Royaume-Uni que j'ai récemment formé à ce système et qui viendra bientôt sur ce fil pour aider lolxhaha. Faites un effort et vous obtiendrez l’aide de ces gars-là. Si je peux le faire à moitié mort, tu devrais pouvoir le faire les yeux fermés. Accédez au fil de discussion Inthebox et apprenez tout ce que vous pouvez à partir de là. ITB est un autre trader qui comprend la situation dans son ensemble. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1){image} {image}[/citation]

Certainly no problem. Just a heads up to lolxhaha and other new traders in case they want to catch up with your gain but overlook risk.  
  
Back to your strategy. The similarity I mentioned is about how to interpret price around SnR.  
  
According to your post #205 and #209, bearish wick candle with previous impulse up move and retest. Historical S/R is at ~0.6528

In other posts I look at retest at area (similar to your “trade zones”) that has weak rejection compared with the last move. Coupled with multiple retest of same area with higher low formation, there is a good chance the level will break and S/R flip will occur.

@tommydog....  
  
IF you have the trading skills and say 30+years experience to grow an account of $10,000 to $50,000, you need to take bigger risk. Your risk is not realistic took a few trades .... but when you study that over 1,000 trades you will learn the hard truth about taking risks. You studied statistics at Hong Kong polytechnic you should know what is the optimum sample size.  
  
Professional traders control risk and they are not afraid to take risks. The problem with small time retail traders like you is the FEAR and GREED emotions which are overwhelming when you are trading with money from you day job.  
  
Anyway here is AU Weekly, there will lots of trades opportunities this week ... but first check the economic calendar and know when to take bigger risk for those +9R to +12R trades.

Good morning/afternoon/evening traders, relatively quiet start of the week for me.  
  
Since we are well into the dead zone for the Asian session, just thought I'd provide an example of a trade entry which I have spotted where there isn't a clear rejection as shown in Rob's earlier post quoted above.  
  
If you looked at Gold during the Tokyo session hours, you would have spotted one such entry on the M15. Of course, trade has to respect all system rules.  
If you didn't take the entry on the M15, no worries because on the M30 there was a valid rejection candle as well, which was the one I took.  
  
Regardless of which entry you took M15 or M30, either entries trades with would netted you a ~4R TP.  
  
Don't feel bad if you didn't take the M15 entry, you would do very well if you can plan and execute the system with rejection candles alone as that should take up the majority of your trades.  
  
I just thought it would be good to have more examples covering the quoted post.  
  
I'll take a breather and come back during the London Session later.

Been taking a look at your thread during some of my free time.  
  
Speaking the engulf language here would be:  
  
I spot potential engulf buy to engulf buy on H1 and M30 forming, but not on H4. Waiting for candle close for confirmation in case it turns into engulf fail

  1. The "compulsive winner," the big money-maker whose Child really does not want to be caught, rarely is, according to reports; he is an untouchable, for whom the fix is always in. *
  2. _The "compulsive loser," on the other hand, who is playing "Cops and Robbers" (C &R), seldom does very well financially._

_*_ If a gang member shows too much interest in the game, to the point of jeopardizing the job, and particularly if his need to be caught begins to show, they (other gang members) will take drastic measures to prevent a recurrence.

that was referring to previous posts.  
you got eyes cannot see what i highlighted is it?  
**post things concerning what is been taught in this thread.**  
what talking you? what indicators are you talking about? rsi? macd? stochastic? bollinger bands?  
they are lines, lines, lines, still cannot see lines is it?  
**only prove that you don't even look at post #1**  
you can focus on your own question only to yourself.  
don't even have an iota of interest in that.  
people here are already making money.

Hi,  
Nice trade, however, could you please elaborate on your thought process to _incorporate the HTF S/R while taking the trade or forming a directional bias_? and which takes precedence between HTF and LTF?  
  
The observations (confusions) that stopped me from taking the trade are:

  1. The LTF bullish move before the market OPEN and the approaching HTF resistance. (a possible move to the POI to fill the PRO's orders)
  2. And, the setup with the rejection candle was at the HTF resistance. ( We cannot buy into the resistance)
  3. While that 4-hour candle was still forming. (could have been a rejection candle @close)

  
Thanks. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f64f.png?v=15.1)

I'm totally paper trading this one to see how it shakes out! Seems like a promising opportunity worth diving into. And the H4 resistance level? It's up there, chilling above the chart, waiting for price to arrive.

Hi fxpider,  
  
Thank you for taking the time to post your questions. I am not too sure on the specifics of what you are asking, but let me try to address those which I can:  
  
**_"thought process to incorporate the HTF S/R while taking the trade or forming a directional bias?"_**  
I have attached several screenshots with annotations, please go through them and post further questions if you have any.  
1st: Daily Line, 2nd: H4 Candle, 3rd: H4 Line, 4th M30 candle  
  
**Update: One thing I forgot to include, always ask yourself where is the 1-2-3 across the timeframes**  
  
**_"which takes precedence between HTF and LTF?"_**  
Always prioritise HTF > LTF. Entries are spotted on lower timeframes (M30/M15) but biases tend to come from HTFs, they are there to inform you of where you may possibly want to look for/ exit trades / take partials. If you form biases over LTF you run the risk of entering trades based on noise rather than signal.  
  
_**"The LTF bullish move before the market OPEN and the approaching HTF resistance. (a possible move to the POI to fill the PRO's orders) And, the setup with the rejection candle was at the HTF resistance. ( We cannot buy into the resistance) While that 4-hour candle was still forming. (could have been a rejection candle @close)"**_  
This portion of your question I do not fully understand, perhaps you can annotate on your chart given which area is referring to which part of the question, and I'll take them in a follow up post.

Hi Traders,

Note: the support cluster. Keep an eye on them they are a good place to get in.

Monday UK time from 7am -8am looking for trades in a two hour, maybe three hour window.  
Saw the line chart on 5 minute seemingly correspond to 4 hour and 15 minute with a possible long around the arrow ? Not a biggie though but thats probably me trying to use this approach.

Hi Turnip, may I ask how did the "s/r" line came about at the price which you marked the possible entry arrow?   
  
Also, just a reminder to omit "MA" or any indicators from your charts in adherence to the thread rules. You may use them for your own trading, but do remember to turn them off before screenshotting your charts for posting here, thanks.

Yes, I have taken a look at your earlier post and there was 2 S/R lines drawn in the area of the price of the more recent post #947. The only conclusion I can come up with is you have added a new line (in yellow) presumably from the swing low between 10 - 14 Feb form your chart in post #916. If that is the case, do you mind adding the screenshot of the origin of the line? Without additional context, I can't really tell if your possible entry was valid or not through the lens of Rob's system.

With NY on holiday today, the volatility is expected to be low. From statistics price tends to “slide” slowly in existing trend and break-reject for the first impulse move. It is more often in Monday morning (Asian “dead zone” as of Island’s term)  
  
We hear about this in many terms, liquidity grab, trap, etc. that is what many people believe the market is taking liquidity to move.

Looking at Island’s charts, entering at rejection candles, those wicks are often testing the further boundary of SR zones drawn by him, or even breached.  
  
It is a bit like ITB’s QM pattern but trading the middle peak instead of waiting for the next one when the formation is across the SR zones.

Hi Emmanuel,  
  
You think something is unrealistic because you haven’t been able to do it yet.  
  
Island’s high 7.5RR method, or high win rate ones, etc… a good strategy can turn out to be good growth over low risk  
  
In your early posts on FF, you confessed you have been losing money for 12+ years.  
You may think traders like us making profit in the first, or few years as unrealistic. On the other hand, we also see keeping failing for years (12+) in trading as unrealistic too. You cannot change the past so I don’t expect you to change your mind. But here we focus on getting to success, so you better cast your failure behind.  
  
Here I quote Inthebox’s words.  
“you sure have a lot of misconstrued assumptions you made on others.  
why are you so bitter?  
turn back, turn back before it is too late and fall into the dark pit.”  
  
Good luck  
  
FYI I studied BioMed in Chinese U of HK. In what reality you are in where I studied statistics in PolyUHK?

Ah - I cannot draw a line from a point forward, meaning once I hit the "draw line" button it draws a horizontal way back from my starting point. Will look into this by playing with the drawing tools![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f602.png?v=15.1)

Here we go. Hope this helps. 4 hour and 5 minute. (Left out in between for clarity)  
See how the levels condense around the US Open 5 minute chart

Recap of today's paper trade: Managed to spot not just one, but two awesome entries even though the market was as chill as a sleeping fish. Tomorrow, I'm feeling ready to place some real trades. Can't wait to see how it all shakes out!

Right now, I'm in a trade and tensions are high. The stop loss is set at 15 pips and it's below the H4 resistance level. Will it hit TP or SL? Only time will tell.

Despite the volatility being low for US holiday, price retested the support zone with rejection wick candles at Asian market open, forming setups for this strategy to enter

Was pondering how price would react to the H4 resistance above. Ultimately, I decided to exit the trade with a satisfying profit of 2R, which had me sweating. As I continue to grasp the system, I think I'll take a breather and watch from the sidelines.

Good trade.  
  
What I like about this is it was also a very straightforward QM pattern. Your knowledge sharing resonates with the current method.

With that you will also gain an understanding of what tweaking the parameters does. Daily Range = Daily High - Daily Low X Day ADR = Sum of previous X days daily ranges / X 10 day ADR = Sum of previous 10 days daily ranges / 10 SMA vs EMA: Simple Moving Average (SMA): Means that if your ADR has a period of ten days, each day contributes an equal weightage (10%) in the ADR calculation...

Thank you so much for this decent primer. It's so much clearer to me now!

I will jump in if there is a break of support in LTF.

the problem is the lower the time frames you go, the more risky it is.  
like for example m1, probably need around 2-3 or more failed attempts to be successful.  
on the other hand, after 3 attempts, the price just go up up up.  
while 2-3 time frames up like the m30 may not present a sell set up at all.  
  
that is where the good experienced traders will be differentiated from the normal ones.  
all boils down to each his own experience. how well he knows the instruments that he is trading.  
  
update with chart.

post #698 above must have kept some of you wondering ... how to trade when there is no rejection candle?

**XAU Feb21 H4 UPDATE:**  
  
\- there was a pull-back and it did not reach the last H4 SnR level  
  
\- is this a case of what is also known as "missed SnR" ?

i am sure that there are traders busy clicking away selling. hit SL and hit SL and hit SL. unless you had hold on to it.  
why?  
i mentioned before that you have to digest the first 22 posts diligently.  
there are only 5 relevant posts from the OP out of which there are 3 salient points to pick out.  
were they being digested properly?  
those who lost selling had missed out on one of the points.  
trade when market opens, unless you can read the market very well and very patient.

now from new york open and after.  
to be more down to earth and pragmatic, we look at each of the time frame from h4 down, each telling their own story.  
depending on how skill the traders are, there are still money to be made or break even.  
however when asia open, price went up until the frankfurt open.

what do you think? workable?  
get that 1% per day equity return and go do what is important in your life.  
whether it's 15 pips or 20 pips. need not stretch so long to 50 pips and staring at screen.  
you can set up another account for h4 set and forget swing trades for that.

Good morning/afternoon/evening traders,  
  
Ran Rob's short back during the NY session, resistance zone test (double top). Was aiming for 7.5R but I closed 80% at 5R, remaining SL shifted to +1R.  
  
Hopefully this answers this question:  
_**"Also question once we have a break retrace is that level still for later ie next day??".**_  
  
Another trade I took was EJ I wasn't sure which direction the open would give us, looking at before the open. So I waited for the open and the market gave us the direction after two candles. I hopped on the train at the next stop. Not the best RR given the larger SL but we still secured our minimum of 2.3R, exited 90% of the trade and shifted the SL to BE. Took more partials because we are heading into a potential triple top resistance.  
  
Update: Exited GU runner @ 8.5R, EJ @ 4.5R  
Update 2: Max travel (MT) for both pairs were (GU: 11.55R, EJ: 7.57)

Hi, recently stumbled across this thread (been following Emmanuel7788 on another thread). Was mainly an equities trader but a recent injury has left me with more time to reflect.  
Read through from the start to recent posts and took the plunge today. The first trade went well with a 1.5R, second stopped out. Charts below from EURUSD (sticking to one whilst I learn). Was my mistake on the 2nd shorting on the pinbar candle? My reasoning for entry was the long wick rejecting the zone(2nd candle, green box)   
  
30m chart below. Colour boxes are the 90-minute windows from sessions opening. Orange lines are 4hr SR.

I've been absolutely loving the past few days since I started following this strategy and diving into the posts from other members - it's been a blast! I can't believe how much my trades have improved since then.

Ahhh got it thanks, was blind to that looking too much into the 30min charts. So should the right move have been wait for the 1D zone as it was close and then focus on on the 30min driven zones when there was more distance?

I have marked out zones which i would have drawn if your chart was what I saw during each of the respective sessions.  
  
A few pointers to note:

  1. **Zones are drawn from the wicks to the candle body (see post #27/ post #83 as examples for both S/R zones)**
  2. **If you have difficulties identifying the peaks/troughs/spikes, they usually become clearer when you switch the chart type from candlesticks to line.**

As to your doubts on trade entries, nothing wrong with the first, it was the one Rob posted but I struggle for the following:  
  
(1) see how your zone in cyan was drawn (which candles did you pick, specifically)  
(2) given how "squished" your chart was, I wasn't able to identify the correct candles/wicks that would have led to your first entry  
  
The first trade looks similar to the one from post #77 of this thread, if you need an example (note the similarities in how the zone was identified in the M5 candlestick chart, not the candles)  
  
**For your line chart, may I suggest you drag along the price line (y-axis of your charts) to make the peaks/troughs/spikes more apparent?**  
  
Regarding your second entry based on the resistance zone I had drawn and used for the first entry, I wouldn't take it because of the following reason:

  1. Candle body have invalidated the zone, with it going over and closing above zone drawn for the first entry

  
I believe you took the trade because of the cyan zone you drew, which incidentally was also the zone you used to take your first trade. This brings me back to the pointers I stated above for the first entry.  
  
The mistake for the second entry was not due to the pinbar candle (in red, that is a bearish candle, not a bullish rejection candle), but because of the zones (middle cyan) being drawn incorrectly. Additionally, we would not take the trade if the candle body closed within the zone, it has to be below for a resistance zone (as per system rules).  
  
As you can see from the first entry, there isn't obvious reverse direction movement prior to each of the sessions open candle (no obvious gradual push of prices up prior to session open in order to sell it), instead it is a continuation of direction that occurred prior to the entry. Echo-ing what Rob has mentioned, take the trade based off the signals the market provide in accordance to the rules. Not always will you get a strong pullback into the previous S/R levels right before the session open, and sometimes you even get the move happening before it, the sessions just provides additional volume to push it up/down.  
  
Good attempt for trying your hand at applying the system shared with trades of your own![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1), keep trying with focus and discipline and you will soon reap the rewards ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Zone (yellow box) is largely correct, however do take note that it is **drawn from wicks to candle body (if the zone was drawn from HTFs, do adjust them on LTF or draw a secondary zone)**  
  
Entry candle is a bullish rejection candle (setup valid), but I would not enter into the trade for the following reasons:  
  
1) While the candle is not a pin bar, the wick has quite a distance from the zone (SL too big, poor RR)  
2) The wick of the bullish rejection candle did not go beyond the upper boundary of the zone (yellow box).  
3) If we treat the red news (FOMC) like a market session, the opening candle was a very very bullish one with strong volume. Note that the opening candle usually marks the direction of the session, as such I would prefer looking for a bullish continuation, rather than a bearish continuation.  
4) The zone you marked as potential resistance has not been tested (no double/triple tops)  
  
If I was looking for a bearish continuation I will wait for more candles to show until I get one that is:  
1) Closer to the potential resistance zone  
2) The wick of the bullish rejection candle goes beyond the upper boundary of the zone (yellow box).  
  
Of course, the following has to also adhere to system rules:  
**1) entering only on candle close from respective timeframes**  
**2) trade taken during open to 90m of open**  
3) All other rules as already mentioned before

Market has done what we'd like it to do, wait for candle close before entering on long  
Yellow zones are M15, red zones are M30. I overlayed them on the same chart.

if you find that the m15 SL too big, after the m15 bullish candle closed that broke the resistant  
switch to smaller time frame m5 to reduce SL.

Still quite a way to go before closing in on 10 day ADR, if close above the highs can look for continuations

A few pointers to note: Zones are drawn from the wicks to the candle body (see post #27/ post #83 as examples for both S/R zones) If you have difficulties identifying the peaks/troughs/spikes, they usually become clearer when you switch the chart type from candlesticks to line. As to your doubts on trade entries, nothing wrong with the first, it was the one Rob posted but I struggle for the following: (1) see how your zone...

thanks for the detailed feedback, very much appreciated. I think I've got confused on the number of zones in my view and tried to slim down or merge and that's working against me.

I already took profits from my earlier buy, wasn't referring to my earlier trade.

Hey everyone!  
  
I just joined FF just because of this system. It seems like a neat tread and even more promising strategy. I have tested a bunch of different strategies over time, and this is the only one where I'm confident about placing my trades because, most of the time, there are obvious entries, and it's up to you whether to enter or not.  
  
I mostly understand how the strategy works, but I'm still scratching the surface on how to spot higher-chance opportunities. Here's my recent catch.  
  
Good luck everyone and thank you all for information!

no.  
1\. ranging pair should not be traded.  
2\. only time you were successful was selling at london open.  
3\. not knowing that price told you 6 times that it refused to go down.  
a good rejection should go down straight away, not lingering there.

higher chance opportunities are when 123 pattern presented itself during market open and news events.

Day 2 Update; Similar story to yesterday; BE on #1, SL on #2. missed the Asian session as the injury couldn't get me out of bed.  
  
Builds from the previous approach;

  1. Flipped back to the line to see areas of peaks and troughs
  2. Sized zones from candle wicks

  
Missed the aggressive push-through from the start of the London session: Would this approach require the need for a retest or would such a bullish candle through SR trigger entry? I have found the two types of candles from earlier in the thread (image below) - are they the only two for beginners?   
  
Sized the new Zone from the London session, but all action around it happened outside of the 90-minute window. I think I would have got SL if I did take it as entry after the big red candle was retraced instantly.   
During US the session, took a short after the third candle, it went long enough to move SL to BE which then triggered. I think on reflection the candle had a long wick at the bottom so maybe not the right candle to action on as that shows there was some retractment.  
Took the second trade on the final candle as the preceding blue had a wick pulling from the zone. That trade then hit SL.  
  
Two questions for support;  
1) are my zones a better reflection of what is expected?  
2) Was I wrong to select those two candles for entry?

The 1-2-3 is essentially what the system is trying to trade (see post #51) All the other factors helps to push the probability of success in our favour: "support and now treating it as resistance" and vice versa is we use to identify the 1-2-3. "within correct times" ensures that our entry at 3 is supported with good volume "price has been going up prior to market open", this is not gospel, but it is common knowledge that in order for big orders to fill (from institutions),...

the day was driven by French and German PMI data  
  
other than what we see on our charts for support and resistance, we have to consider the market' reaction to news/data   
  
and the average daily trading range   
  
the ADR was exceeded and it collapses and the Daily direction is intact

Personally I find no need to overlay both the line chart and candle charts together when you can have them side by side. To my knowledge, in MT4/5 the lines and zones drawn on one should be carried over to the other. You may also toggle between the two

I tried line overlay in the early days and it was not clear enough, not to say that is is no good, it is down to the individual.  
Line chart on it's own is where you should start. If you cannot see the trade on a line chart, there is no trade. 

Your trade order needs to be in the right place at the right time.

As usual, annotations on your provided chart given for explanation.  
  
Note your first entry was not valid for the following reasons:  
(1) candle was not a bullish rejection  
  
If it was bullish but did not reject the zone you could have done an entry without rejection. At this point let's focus on the getting the main course right before going for desserts.

Sharing some trades I took during london session.  
  
_**EU**_  
Reason for the Eur/USD counter buy trade is clearer when you glean the H1/H4 line chart:  
H1: previous double top resistance turned support  
H4: 1-2-3 on buy bias.  
  
Not sure how buy will turn out, but I'm entering based on what i see from HTFs. Will shift SL to BE after the first 30 minutes (now @ the time of writing this post).  
  
  
**_Gold_**  
M15 zone sell setup (1-2-3), note on the line chart we were selling into the H4 support. So reminder to always factor in HTFs when planning where to take profits / exit your trades.

You can review your trades taken this week during the weekend, which did hit 7.5R and which did not. Look at the higher timeframes and see if they give you an ideas as to the reasons why.  
  
In my opinion, it will be difficult for you to gain confidence just by hitting X number of winning trades to proceed "trying" for a 7.5R and hope for the best. There will be times where all the stars align but your trade goes against you. Remember that trading is all about probabilities.

SL hit ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Is this a valid sell if M30 rejects with a bullish candle? However there are many H4 zones that is above.

You win some you lose some, don't worry too much about SLs being hit if your set up was adhering to all system rules.

You should be able to tell if the setup is valid or not. We are teaching you to fish not fish for you, if you are not sure best not to trade or practice with demos first.

**Update - an abridge of the full post**  
Its hard not to conclude that what often passes for trading information / education / exploration amounts to playing a game of chart glamorisation, mesmerizations and hypnotization with questionable application.

Take a look at post #884, multiple examples of what a 1,2,3 is provided already. Compare it with your 1-2-3, what do you think is the difference

you took reference from previous day.  
1\. touch and drop. no confirmation.  
2\. focus on current market price as confirmation making the same pattern as previous day around the same level.  
my preference is no. 2.

As more questions came in recently regarding the system shared in this thread by Rob, I have a few things to say.  
  
**_Trade-related questions of similar nature like this in future will not be answered:_**  
Throwing un-organized/random charts as a post and asking "Is this correct", "Should I take this trade".  
  
_**Ladies/ gents, your learning is ultimately in your own hands (Most relevant information are already posted earlier or by Rob)**_  
Yes, it is tedious to go through 1000+ posts and read every single one, or filtering through to look for the answer to your question. But inflating the post count in this thread with badly constructed questions will only serve to make the problem worse because there are now more posts to scroll / filter through, for you and other readers in future.  
  
**Before you ask any questions, take the appropriate screenshots.**  
At least your line chart + your candlestick chart if regarding a trade. Try to follow the format which was taught to you, it will be easier for the seniors to understand your questions and for fellow learners of the system.  
  
Can I give you the answer directly? Yes, but what is the point of spoon feeding you?  
You will either take or not take that trade and come back with the same question again next day/week/month.  
**Providing signals is not the point of this thread.**  
  
"Why can't you just tell me the answer?" By doing so, here is what will happen:  
**1) You will never gain the self-confidence of being able to spot and enter trades _by yourself._**  
**2) You will not own your mistakes, since the final decision to trade or not is made by someone else.**  
**3) What will happen to you when person X is no longer here/ not available to respond/answer you with a yes or no?**  
  
Trading is a very personal journey, everyone are at different stages along the journey.  
Everyone is trying to reach similar destinations but our paths will almost always be different.  
We are trying to give you a compass/map to navigate yourself, not a taxi ride.  
  
In addition to posting your charts with your questions, please spend some time to ponder over these few pointers and include them together with your question:  
  
What are your reasons for entering this trade?  
Specifically, what are your analyses (in terms of timeframes/ zones/ candles) that led you to believe/ told you that this is a trade to take?  
  
This will help those replying to your question(s) be able more easily identify these:  
1) What did you do correctly  
2) What did you not do correctly  
3) Point you to relevant information to other posts to help you clarify (2).  
  
**Do remember to take your own notes of the system rules/examples/ the like. Even something as simple as noting which post # relates to what will save you time from having to scroll/filter/search through the entire thread to find what you need, you will re-visit some of the information definitely in future. Think of it as placing bookmarks for important chapters in a book that is ever growing.**  
  
If you are sharing trades your took based on Rob's system or any other systems allowed, feel free to post away.  
If you are a new trader trying to practice / learn the system, do ensure you have understood the information shared. Ask away if you have any questions relating to the system, no charts are needed.  
  
We are all cheering for your progress/success. Help us help you.

Day 3 Update:   
Still plugging with EURUSD however I think I might need to expand to GBPUSD or gold next week to get more hours under the belt.  
  
Finished the day on +1.5R which leaves me 0..5R up on the week. Not massive but not negative and I'm more concerned about learning principles right now.  
  
Focused on the 15-minute charts today (no reason other than to see if other TFs gave clues)   
Asian Session - didn't see any clear rejection candles around 4HR or 30min zones so no trades  
London Session - No Bullish rejection at Key zone Asain high hit. Was tempted by the 2nd candle which engulfed the opening candle but there was strong support shown on the 4HR SR so it didn't seem like there was much opportunity   
US Session - Took trade on 2nd candle. It looked like a bullish rejection candle and trade opening was close to the zone. Marked a TP and lower 4HR SR as the London session had broken first easily. Closed trade when there was a big reaction of the lower SR (long wick). Probably should have waited for the obvious 3 before trading and might have got a higher sell price but the bullish rejection at a zone drove the decision.  
  
  
bit of homework this weekend to replay the charts and look for 123s.

@Phylo  
  
trading without indicators aka naked trading is beyond most traders. 95% of traders will lose money.  
  
it takes years of practice in real-time live market for a handful of traders to achieve trading mastery ... then become consistent profitable traders.  
  
the method shared here by the OP @Islandfx911 is just one of many different methods trading without technical indicators. it is no holy grail. it requires a consistent approach with technical analysis of the market.  
  
trading requires a certain discipline to trade only certain technical setup conditions over a long time to see real end-results.  
  
thanks for those links and with an open mind we definitely can learn more and expand on what we already know.

@majidmas  
  
so long you have your own reasons why you sell at that level then you are correct.  
  
to me it look like the Daily shows an impulse move and hitting the BRN12700 which was also the Day high of the previous day Feb22 (PMI data).  
  
after the impulse move, in the LTF do you see 123 corrective 'waves' @12700 ?

Continue working on spotting trades and if you have the bandwidth, try to increase the pairs you are scanning.  
  
I suggest starting with 3, pick them based on the predominant session you tend to trade. If you are only looking at one, there is a higher likelihood to force trades (taking trades where there are none) during times where there are nothing much going on in terms of trade entries, because you are focused only looking at one pair.  
  
As Rob mentioned earlier, if it helps you, you can pepper your charts with notes the gist of what the chart is telling you. It could be something like:  
"1-2 formed, look for 3 at next session", etc.  
  
As always, if in doubt zoom out, if still in doubt sit out

I have annotated my charts to provide some context on what my beliefs / opinions are prior to the trade.  
  
Some of them are formed with influence from these posts:  
**Ranging AUD upcoming (By rob)**  
[https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...9#post14759999](https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/post/14759999#post14759999) (#909, by extension also #649)

I mentioned some terminologies that are not used by the system in hopes of providing better context.  
I will not do so in future as they can confuse newer traders, and also since they are not used in this system.  
  
@Emmanuel, I hope this answers your question

Maybe this would help with some clarity.  
  
**AUDUSD Indexes on the D1 chart**  
  
USD rejecting support (making HH-HL)+Trendline confluence.  
AUD rejecting resistance.  
  
Reason why the pair has been ranging as you can see is because of the **dojis** at these levels. One rejecting **support** and the other rejecting **resistance**. At the same time anything could happen i.e. USD down and AUD up or vise versa.  
  
So somesort of **price** **inaction i.e. consolidation****(AUDSUD H4/M30)** for now until either one indexes breakouts or bounces off thus revealing **price action** on the pair.  
  
So waiting on market play for more clearer direction. (but I see an **ascending triangle** pattern within the consolidation too, hmm).  
  
My analysis.

3 starting points.  
ny open  
news events  
nyse open  
monitor one of them or all 3.  
  
if there are red news like cpi etc, then it's obvious this is the time to monitor all the way to nyse open.

It CAN take years to overcome the flood of informations around trading, before realizing more than 99% is like holding water in the hands. 

Market is more simple as you think.

Hey Rob, Is trading during the first 1.5 hours of a session mandatory? I am missing out on a lot of trade opportunities, which is why I am asking this question.

Most should follow the rules as much as possible. That being said, there are examples where the rules are bent. You may refer to post #826, where rob took a trade before market open.  
  
Coincidentally, I took a gold short today after the 90 minute mark during the london session. This was my first time breaking the rules, so I feel rule-breaks / bends should be few and far in between your regular trades. Additionally, rule breaks should still follow all system rules in terms of your HTF -> LTF analysis and entry criteria.  
  
P.S: Before you look at breaking rules, may I suggest you increase the number of pairs you are scanning for trades. Ideally you should have about 6 - 9 pairs to look at during your most active session(s). It should be easier for you to identify setups on a variety of pairs rather than looking at a few and having to overfit the system with rule breaks. It should be treated as a last resort, and should only be experimented with only when you have good mastery of the system.  
  
To prevent forming of bad habits (i.e tendency to break rules increases, once you have broken rules a few times. -> If I can break this rule, I can break other rules, etc). Again do so at your own risk.

Is up to you.  
  
To make money we need market to move. Bigger the moves bigger the profits we can make.  
And biggest moves we have when markets opens.

Expanded my "watch list" to GBPUSD and USDJPY  
  
Didn't see much on USDJPY or EURUSD with 30 mins TF. On review, there might have been opportunities using 15min for EURUSD.   
  
I found a trade on GBPUSd for 1R return after being stopped out, I thought I saw signs for a longer run so move SL up.  
  
Didn't take the trade Evaldas321 took (great work) as was waiting for a retest but on reflection, should have looked further back to see it was R flipping to S and had been tested already. Should have acted on the bearish rejection.   
  
Are 7 (or 4 pips I think I saw Rob use on diff currency pair) used constantly or is there a more dynamic view?

hey @tommydog....  
  
this thread is No Indicator Trading System.   
  
You are trading with RSI/MA and posting your charts here without the RSI/MA to mislead people wanting to learn @Islandfx911 ' system.  
  
You should read the OP' post#1 and learn to draw the SnR levels on higher timeframe Daily, H4 and H1 then zoom down to M30.  
The key here is look for impulse move in the price and the pullback, then a rejection candle.

@tommydog....  
  
It is quite simple if you do the usual top down SR line according to post #1. Your RSI/MA cross signal is very late for entry.  
  
the 4Hr SnR is quite clear  
the 1Hr SnR is also clear with the price GAP  
  
the rejection candle of the 1Hr GAP SnR   
  
remember there must be a impulse move and a pullback,  
  
the timing for the entry is the Close of the m30 rejection candle

Sharing a trade I took on EU during the london session earlier,  
  
Initial entry on the M30 got stop hunted. On HTFs, there was a clear rejection of the recent swing high. Found another M15 entry whilst it was falling and managed to catch the bulk of the move. Exited 70% of the trade at +4R, shifted SL to BE for the runner.

I don't have specific rules on how to set stop losses, aside from the >10 pips use limits as shared by Rob, and minimally targets should be 2.3R (to account for fees/ commissions from your broker). There are quite a number of factors to consider, some use the zone boundaries as a guide some use the wicks as a guide and depending on the setup (wicks exceeding zone or not) you may have to roll with the punches.  
  
SLs differ from trader to trader, but you should keep in mind to have a reasonable risk reward ratio. I think at least having 2.3R is a good starting point. If many of your trades are 1:2R or less from one zone to another based on the system rules it could be a sign that your SLs might be a little too wide.

good day. I don't know how and where to write a private message on FF. so I'll write it right here. i just read the whole discussion. I have a question. Did any of the discussants try to enter the market on the 1H (4H) chart. if this system is even functional for inputs on these graphs? I understand that SL will be bigger. thank you Beri29

You can definitely enter on higher timeframes (i.e 1H, 2H, 4H) as long as you don't mind SLs being larger.  
  
The HTF -> LTF exercises are done with D1 -> H4 -> M30, which you can notice is approximate X6 zoom in for each drill down.   
  
Your HTF - LTF for H1 as the entry could be W1 -> D1 -> H4, think of H1 as a M15 or M5 chart in the context of the system taught.

I think your time zone is Singapore focused?  
By London session do you mean the first two hours - 8am to 10am UK time ?

My local time is based on GMT+8 (Singapore) which is what you see on my charts, but yes you are right in the sense that London session refers to the first 90 minutes since open.  
  
The system shared looks for entry only within 90 minutes of any session (Sydney, Tokyo, London, US), as shared earlier that most of the volume of each come in during the first ~90 minutes.  
  
The only exception to the norm is any red news which occur outside of this window , which personally I treat it like a separate session in itself.

Failed break of zone boundaries and wicks are good to minimise SL with use of stop order or timely market price entries. Referring to Island’s posts and charts

Hey everyone, greetings from Lithuania again!  
  
Sharing my today's journey:  
  
My shorted EURUSD SL was hit this morning as I left it from yesterday. I should have placed it to BE to minimize loses before leaving it for longer – a note for my upcoming trades.  
  
Placed a sell in USDCAD a couple times as 1-2-3 pattern was nicely formed, but both times SL was hit, no big dieal. I didn't risk the 3rd time, no matter how well everything looked.  
  
And I shorted AUDUSD a couple of times. The first time SL was hit at breakeven, but since I liked the resistance, I shorted it once more (although a bit late) and got some returns. Closed half and moved my SL to the most recent high. SL was hit.  
  
**All in all: 3 failed and 1 successful trades today, and the day is still profitable**. I think I'll leave my notes that I made while planning on the chart. Tips and criticism are welcome!  
  
See you all next time!

Does anyone use hedging in place of SL, as SL? Can keep SL as small as you want. If hedge triggered and trade still valid, can enter 2nd entry and close hedge at small profit or BE, adding new hedge SL based on both entries. If trade not valid, entry in opposite direction to cancel small loss. Just an idea, would like feedback.

Great day overall  
  
Sharing UC trade and AU trade which was entered during London session.  
  
For the **UC trade** , i penned what were some of my beliefs in the chart, with the liquidity sweep ending up as a pin bar, I wasn't keen on entering right away (unable to even get 2.3R at target zone with such a big SL). The upcoming red news at 9:30 (local time) also made me uncertain as to which direction the market would go. I placed a buy limit at the upper bound of the zone with a smaller SL.  
  
Accepted the fact that if price did came down to the price which I wanted to enter for a buy and still get stopped out, I was okay with it.  
News came and price did whipsaw, evident with the large wicks you see but ended up in my favour, cashed the trade at 8.9R when it hit the target zone.  
  
**AU trade**  
Entered on the last candle before the 90 minute window closed during London and didn't look / forgot about it until NY session. Cashed that out at 7R when it hit the target zone.  
  
At this point I have hit my profit target for this week but I'll still look at the charts for the rest of the week but will only trade if **the setup jumps out** at me.

No good trades for me today; ended -1R.  
USDJPY BE trade, took short during the Asian session, and moved to BE after 2R reached, the mistake here was that move as it then missed out on the big drop through to the London Session. I was sticking to 30min views only but saw something on 15min worth a take.  
  
EURUSD -1R. Didn't take the trade lolxhahah took as it wasn't by definition a bullish rejection. Maybe this is where I need to look closer at 4hr lines. I also noticed we have different zones marked out for 30 mins.  
  
Reflection for today was zones - I was using the last few days to mark out the 30m zones which created lots of zones and more noise. How far back on LTF do others go back when gauging their zones?

**using multi time frames trading.**  
  
q2. i prefer to see a clean chart every start of day.  
i use d1 and h4 in your example as my**directional bias**  
from the time you go to your computer and open a chart, the focus is on **current market price**.  
draw 2 lines closest to current market price, one support and one resistant in each time frame.  
so now you have 4 lines.  
where is price now relative to the above 4 lines that you had drawn?  
clean clear chart no multi lines to clutter my view.  
  
q1. using your m30 as entry chart.  
again the focus is on **current market price**.  
again where is price now relative to the 4 lines that you had drawn?  
above? below? in the middle?  
the only job now is to **patiently wait for the entry set up**.  
whether it is a line or a box according to the eyes of the individual that bring comfort.

I will go through the system from start to finish and when completed I will post live trades and answer any questions you have. The system is based on support and resistance of which I can use daily, 4hr, 1hr, 30m and 15m to establish a trade entry. I do not get it right everyday so no promises.

Good sharing, and I think it will be even better if accompanied by the understanding that price movements are limited by time. For example, when you see several candlesticks arranged to form a unidirectional movement in the H4 time frame, it will have the strength to form one candle in the D1 time frame, but this still cannot guarantee that one candle in the D1 time frame will be confirmed as a bull candle or bear candle while today's market has not closed. To get an easier understanding, you only need to switch to a higher time frame to compare the achievement of the high price, low price and closing price between a candle that is currently moving and a candle that has previously formed.

AUDUSD at Asia open.  
  
0.649 has been a historical S/R zone upper boundary from the S/R flip since Feb19.

USDJPY BE trade, took short during the Asian session, and moved to BE after 2R reached, the mistake here was that move as it then missed out on the big drop through to the London Session.

For the EU short, yes you are right that on the M30 there would have been no entry. Mine was found on the M15. As for the question of how far back on the LTF do we go back when gauging zones, no strict rules sometimes price will respect a very recent zone created hours before, sometimes price will respect a zone 3 days ago. If lets say the price is exploring a new area (i.e when you look left of the candle its very "empty", then you should keep looking back until you find something unless its at all time highs / lows. When the price is not exploring a new area, then prioritise your zone to have multiple touches, or zones has been confirmed to be s/r flips. The line chart will be your best friend for this.   
  
p.s On your charts the text annotations are a tad too small to be read, do increase the size of them

@tommydog....  
  
what 0.649 are you talking about  
  
and Feb 19 did not go anywhere that 0649 level  
  
06503 is an old Monthly SnR which goes back to May 01,2023.  
  
I think your mobile screen is too small to see the historical data

Hi Machiyara, on top of the fantastic explanation ITB has provided on MTF and the drill down exercise, I would like to point you to post #691 as well as #697 as the questions are of a similar nature and Rob has taken the time to explain them in detail with examples.  
  
Additionally, D1 usually does not change too much in the context of this system. But H4 charts you have to review them on a weekly basis (on weekends) and if needed (based on price movement) you may have to either adjust the lines to fit the new data coming into throughout this week, or remove and add new ones if there is significant up / down movements such that the current market price on the H4 has exceeded either your H4 support / resistance. I hope this answers your question.

Wonderful explanation. However, just wondering about the reasons not to select the pointed resistance even though they are closer to the CMP, compared to the selected resistance. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)

GU Feb28 where to exit?  
  
\- a good trading task would be to protect what the market gave you  
  
\- final exit is Daily SnR 126306   
  
\- but first I lock-in +5R and let the market decide

Thanks Inthebox for detailed explanation.  
I wanted to confirm that in your second picture you have drawn a few rectangles. These zones are marked from the line chart of 30m right?

Sharing trade taken during London session.  
  
Took 50% partials of trade @ +5R, for the runner I have shifted the SL to +5R level. Will take another 30% at +7.5R at the zone above and if all goes to plan full TP at the key level @ 1.08583  
  
Took the trade for these additional reasons on top of the standard rules:  
\- Key level SR flip H4  
\- ADR low sat near key level and price was approaching it but closed just at the upper bound of entry zone  
  
Some may ask where is the 1-2-3 here? The answer is in the H4 chart.  
  
Update: fully exited trade at +5R

Hi Lolxhaha  
Thanks for your reply.  
There is one thing bugging me, the chart you posted in the quoted post and also as seen throughout the thread, entry is taken in 30m or 15m and rectangle zones are also made in 30m so how does the lines of Daily or 4H help.  
Because if we drew zones directly to 30m and then look for entry in 30m would we really need to mark lines in HTF?

Not a great day my side down -2R.   
  
EURUSD   
Took a short on US session from what seemed a bullish rejection but stopped out few candles later for -1R.  
  
GBPUSD  
Took a short at London open which hit 2R. Short in the US session hit SL. Net +1R  
  
AUDUSD  
Took two long trades on bearish rejection candles during US and London, both hit SL. Net -2R  
  
I'm not quite sure what to make of today, was confident in my levels, perhaps I am forcing trades looking for that first 7R. Don't think I can accurately call the 123s either still.

> {quote} Hi Lolxhaha Thanks for your reply. There is one thing bugging me, the chart you posted in the quoted post and also as seen throughout the thread, entry is taken in 30m or 15m and rectangle zones are also made in 30m so how does the lines of Daily or 4H help. Because if we drew zones directly to 30m and then look for entry in 30m would we really need to mark lines in HTF?

Hi Machiyara, although this question of skipping the HTF -> LTF drill down has been asked before and answered by ITB, let me take this question again for clarity.  
  
The short answer is **yes, because context is key.**  
  
The long answer:  
(1) HTF lines, for example H4 tells you where price might possibly head to within a four hour window, same goes for daily timeframe. This is the reason why we want at least one S/R above and one below for each timeframe (2 for H4 + 2 for D1) near the current market price as those are the key levels most relevant to the price at that point in time.  
  
(2) We generate our directional bias from the HTF (daily) and MTF (middle timeframe charts, in this case H4), they give you a sense of whether you want to be looking for longs or shorts with your M30 /M15 entries. This alignment is important as we want to lean on the side with higher probability. Will it happen every time? **No, there will be times when all the stars align and the trade still goes against you. The sooner you can accept that and move on the better.** What we are trying to do is to have as good of a chance as we can get with every entry.  
  
Let me give you an example, if let's say you did not do the HTF -> LTF drill down and supposedly it was a bear (d1) -> bear (h4). Yet on the entry timeframes (m30/m15), you spot a 1-2-3 but it is a bullish one. Would you take the trade? Suppose you do, nobody knows whether it will work/ not work out for you but you have to keep in mind that **_one H4 candle is made up of 8 M30 candles. Similarly one D1 candle is made up of 6 H4 candles, and thus 48 M30 candles._ **What is the implication of this point? The trade may work out for you in the very short term and come back to bite you in the medium/ long term because you are swimming against the currents. While the system uses timeframes that would be considered short term day-trading, please do not misunderstand it as a scalping one.  
  
(3) HTF/ MTF gives us an idea of where you can place your TP targets. If you plotted every zone in the M30, you would (1) have a lot of zones, (2) have a high chance that zones are very close to each other. Say you entered a trade on the M30 and now it is the dead zone after your entry (> 90 minutes into the session). Are you going to sit in front of your computer and watch if the price is pushing past or rejecting every M30 zone in the way?  
  
The whole point is to trade and be able to live your life, not have your life revolve around trading.

**Side note** : The thread will continue to expand, I urge all readers to "bookmark" information you deem important. There will be times where you need to either re-visit some of the concepts taught or when someone asks a question that you might also have.  
Skimming the entire thread from start to finish, you will not be able to retain most of the content. Go through 10-20 posts at a time, digest it, practice it and create your own notes/bookmarks/chapters, how you do it is up to you. It will be tedious and may take some time now, but will pay off immensely in the future, remember that **your learning is in your own hands**.

Hi Hanz,  
One of the traders here will help shortly, go over the thread again and take your time absorbing the information. It must be crystal clear to you before you place trades.

Both the EURUSD and GBPUSD are correlated, notice how the line charts are very similar. Take note of the key levels on your MTF and HTF.  
  
I like your trade in the second chart, it was a good trade. I suppose your TP was somewhere around the key level you marked out in orange. If you took partials around the key area you should be in a good position (if you set your SLs properly, it should have easily netted you +3R). Perhaps you can look into how you placed your SL. Shifting BE to +2R is alright but before you do that do take some partials first.  
  
For the AUDUSD, the NY session opened with the price sandwiched between the ADR on top and the key level below. If you look the market open till 90minutes into the session, the NY session was trying to bounce off the London lows to go up but was quickly rejected at the ADR. I would be wary of entering trades where the market is not sure of which direction to go.  
  
Do include your ticker names, I could tell the last was AUDUSD but between your first two charts i couldn't really tell which was GU and which was EU since they are very similar

> Not a great day my side down -2R. EURUSD Took a short on US session from what seemed a bullish rejection but stopped out few candles later for -1R. GBPUSD Took a short at London open which hit 2R. Short in the US session hit SL. Net +1R AUDUSD Took two long trades on bearish rejection candles during US and London, both hit SL. Net -2R I'm not quite sure what to make of today, was confident in my levels, perhaps I am forcing trades looking for that first 7R.

hi @Hanz99  
  
with hindsight I can write long story with your charts.  
  
what is important is what you see at the start of your trading day.  
  
remember we are day trading... so start with the same process in post #1.

Hi G,  
There is a winning system here, you just need to learn it like so many others have.  
The are no free tickets and I find it insulting that you have come to this thread expecting to be given a profitable system without you putting any effort in.  
Let me know when you have read all the posts and when you start asking the right questions you will get help. 

Your trade order needs to be in the right place at the right time.

Excuse me? There are so many threads with so many posts. I'm not expecting to be given anything I asked a simple question. You could have simply said there a sys tem here that works...we don't do swing trading here. I already have a system that works I'm not looking for a free ticket. Just doing research.

GBPUSD setup at NY opening hour.  
  
1.2636 - 1.264 has been a SR flipping zone in Feb. Break-rejection at the further side boundary is a strong indication of strong rejection.

Hi Traders,  
There were a couple of trades that you could have entered today.  
AJ long, a text book setup at Asian open and GJ 1hr short during Euro session.  
My SL for GJ is at +4  
Seems that other than a few dedicated traders. This thread is getting quiet.  
It appears people like indicators. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Spotted a gold continuation trade and took it.  
If you look at the 4H chart the zone is there, but notice we did not have a bearish rejection candle, but note that **H4 candles are made of multiple LTF candles**. Using the H4 zone overlaid onto the H1 chart the bearish candle shows itself.  
  
If you were scanning for entries using M30/M15 zones it would have failed the rules. I thought it is a good reminder that H1 charts are also usable for entries.  
  
The LTFs are there for you to enter at the **right place** without a humongous SL.  
  
Thought I shared a H1 example as well as we don't have many of them in the thread. Last image is a screenshot from post 1

Nope, do not like indicators. Still learning and testing your system, so far so good.

Hey everybody,  
  
It's my second week testing this strategy. Still trying to figure out all the quirks and nuances, still a bit trigger-happy. However, I just started going through all posts yesterday, taking notes on tips and essentials that I missed out while reading the thread for the first time. I'm surprised how many things I've missed!  
  
I have a question: **maybe someone could list which pairs are good for trading during NY and London sessions?** I only found the list of pairs that Rob is using for Asian session. London session starts at 10AM and then follows the NY session at 3PM, so I catch them both.  
  
Anyway, in order to not post without charts, I took a partial profit today and thought it could hit a TP2 too, but hit BE instead.

Hi Evaldas, do take a look at post #611 for the answers to your question. You are welcome to post without charts when it is not a trade or you are not asking about something specific to a trade.

Hi Traders,  
I have two short positions on AU with profit locked in.  
TP 1 is 7.5R

Some of the more experienced traders probably know this but I thought it would be helpful to newer traders.  
  
I hypothesised that **news(red) could be treated like separate sessions** by looking at volume of past news. Here are some screenshots on today's trade that support my hypothesis.  
  
Although I'm not too sure how long does the "news effect" last, for simplicity sake you may treat them as a session (90mins since news).  
  
For those on tradingview, you can hover over the candles and if your settings are not changed you should be able to see them in the top left side of your charts on the tickers with the OHLC information.  
  
For MT4/5 users, charts by default come with a volume indicator as well. Note that **indicators aren't allowed** so you will not see them in future charts.  
  
Just keep a mental note whenever you see news upcoming.  
21:00/ 9pm is my local time that corresponds with the NY open for those confused.

Not necessarily

> Spotted a gold continuation trade and took it. If you look at the 4H chart the zone is there, but notice we did not have a bearish rejection candle, but note that H4 candles are made of multiple LTF candles. Using the H4 zone overlaid onto the H1 chart the bearish candle shows itself. If you were scanning for entries using M30/M15 zones it would have failed the rules. I thought it is a good reminder that H1 charts are also usable for entries. The LTFs are there for you to enter at the right place without a humongous SL. Thought I shared a H1 example...

Hi B,  
I would suggest you use higher timeframe analysis to identify clear support and resistance zones.  
I am not going to write to much about it as it is all in this thread.  
Hope this chart helps.

from the first 5 relevant posts of islandfx, i have made a summary from **my point of view**.  
if you can**fully** digest and understand them, and then further able to**apply** proficiently,  
then these can be yours to take to make a living out of it.  
  
1\. drawing higher time frames support resistant to map out the key levels and direction of trades.  
2\. wait patiently for price to arrive at the key levels during markets open / sessions.  
3\. wait patiently for lower time frames support resistant trade set up to align with those of higher time frames.  
  
if you still cannot achieve the consistency of 75% winners, then you have to further  
scrutinize on your own discipline, patience and consistency in following the rules to achieving success.  
these nobody can help you.  
  
of course there will be some exceptions where some traders no matter what,  
still cannot spot the set ups. then you have to admit that this is not for you.

Hi FS,  
Its a nice pullback to resistance however, I would not be trading AJ coming into the Euro Session with my system.  
Your entry candle is prior to market open unless you are 100% familiar with this system  
If you are taking 7.5R winners you will need to get used to be stopped out  
I would go back over the thread and get your questions answered from studying it.  
Trade Well

Your trade order needs to be in the right place at the right time.

I would sit out or look at other pairs for better opportunities, reasoning annotated on my provided screenshot. A very short or no wick when the candle closes suggests strong price movement in the direction (bull or bear). The subsequent candle could carry that same momentum in that direction. The wick is proof that at one point in that timeframe the price went there but ultimately closed below/ above that price, hence the "rejection".  
  
A candle that does not have a noticeable wick or none is just "bullish / bearish ~~rejection~~ " if you catch my point. "Thrust" candles are just a term Rob gave to these candles with little to no wicks, because of a lack of "rejection". You can refer to post #87, #93, #94 where a similar question regarding candle selection was answered by Rob on post #94.

Well done! Good trade but I just wanted to clear your misconception of the 1-2-3, it is correct in the sense that there is a 1-2-3 present just that the numbering is slightly incorrect.  
  
(1) refers to an impulse, which in your chart would have been the bullish move origin all the way till the recent swing high  
  
(2) is the pullback from the recent swing high to where your entry candle is  
  
(3) is the supposed continuation of the (1) impulse move which begins with the subsequent candle when your entry candle closed  
  
so how does the correct 1-2-3 look like?  
  
in your chart you just need to replace where it was stated 2 with 1 and 3 with 2. All other numbers can be removed 3 is at where your entry candle would be.  
  
This does not take away anything from a good trade which you entered, I just wanted to clear up the misconception in case others who saw your chart may become confused or pick up on the misconception![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d-1f3fb.png?v=15.1)

Used Friday last week to re-read the thread - it helped having tried this for a few days to add context to comments made.  
Took AU trade at the start of the Asain session and closed during London for 3R.  
  
It felt like an advanced trade with price spiking above 4hr SR (orange line) and hitting resistance just above it from Friday - however reflected Rob's comments about the price rising pre-market to fill the order to then drop and example from trading pre-market open. I am not sure that 4HR SR is correctly placed, would welcome any thoughts on that (2nd screenshot)

I cant 't see an obvious move materialising so tight sit this one out. 4HR zoom looks tight following Friday spike - think I'm looking to hard for something that might not be there.  
  
Wonder if the below 123 might play out through NY session.

Spotted a re-entry candle on the M15 after initial long got stopped. Price hit 4R which I exited 80% of my position to cover my first entry and then some while leaving the rest to run at BE, target is the initial target of the first entry.  
  
Update: Runner hit TP target @ 12R.  
  
**There is a very fine line between a valid re-entry vs revenge trading.**  
If you are looking for re-entries after your first trade has been stop hunted, do note the following:  
  
\- re-entries should still follow the system rules  
\- wait for clear indication that your first entry (direction is going in your favour, PA will be your confirmation for this)  
  
If you are not sure of the market direction, it is better to stay out and let the market play out. _**Being stopped out and then having the trade go in your direction is a good loss in my opinion. Because this is a problem which you can fix that is within your control.**_  
  
If you have find yourself often re-entering trades, it might be a sign that your SLs have been consistently too tight/ shifting SLs too early. **You will only be able to notice if you have been journaling your trades.**  
  
Treat the root cause (fix your SL setting) and not the symptoms with band-aids (often re-entering).

I reread the entire thread during the weekend and rewrote my step-by-step plan to avoid uncertain and bad trades. I am now limiting myself to 2 trades per session max. That way I choose my trades more carefully and I only place trades when everything seems perfect, not just fine.  
  
I am done for today. I had 4 trades over EU and NY sessions: -1R, +4R, +3R, and +7R. There was a high chance that GBPUSD will reach 26800 level, so I thought I'll go BE and see what happens. As with EURJPY, I thought the price may hit the red S/R at least once more, so I didn't want to place TP above it, which led to 3R. I hope I'll experience more days like this with this stricter approach.

if you were looking for a sell, there was no valid m30 sell set up.  
you were using a h4 and m30 combo.  
you had drawn a h4 resistant but the m30 did not form any 123 sell during**london open**.  
your 123 was very far apart. your point 1 was from 2 days ago.  
your focus should be watching whether the **current market price** form a 123 during market open.  
  
same thing for new york open.  
see the 123 is current for entry time frame, not formed far far away from the past.

This might have been taken out of context. It is important to note what the market is doing before the market open. "Big players need to manipulate prices in order to fill big orders" **This is true** , **and zones tend to be a fairly good area that provides liquidity, but prices does not always hit a zone and bounce in the opposite direction during the open.**   
  
As you can see the move (sell-off) already happened before the market open, so the open is just a continuation of that sell-off with volume.

gu h4 resistant.  
h4 m15 combo.  
just watch patiently whether there is a valid m15 **current market price** sell set up or not.  
be aware that we are outside of market open.  
please do not trade, just observe.

> I reread the entire thread during the weekend and rewrote my step-by-step plan to avoid uncertain and bad trades. I am now limiting myself to 2 trades per session max. That way I choose my trades more carefully and I only place trades when everything seems perfect, not just fine. I am done for today. I had 4 trades over EU and NY sessions: -1R, +4R, +3R, and +7R. There was a high chance that GBPUSD will reach 26800 level, so I thought I'll go BE and see what happens. As with EURJPY, I thought the price may hit the red S/R at least once more, so...

i would say according to your own experience that make you comfortable.  
the blue candle for entry will do.  
or if more confirmation needed, just move down one time frame to see a red candle.

well as usual let the markets open or news show the way.

no, i am not great.  
the answer is simple.  
i am probably better than 80% of traders in having the patience, discipline and consistency in following the rules.

Didn't see many opportunities live across AU,GU EJ and EU today.  
  
Took one trade on AU at start of NY session but SL hit. There was a reversal shortly after but didn't think it was right as had passed my zone - perhaps my zone was marginally out which cost me. would welcome anyone else's view of the the zones they marked out for this period.  
  
Took another on EJ for 4.5R, Went short during the London session and rode down to 4hr resistance level. Should have left run for 7.5R easily.   
  
Saw your trade emerge ITB however it was outside the 90min window for me - looks like a great yield.   
  
Think I'm up since starting this which feels good but trades still come with limited confidence.

Hey everyone,  
Took a couple losses during London session this morning (-2R). During NY session I didn't see anything I like, but later noticed a nice setup in AUDUSD and took +7R. Overall +5R today

Thank you Inthebox this is very helpful.  
Post 884 and 152 for example show “bigger 123s” (15m or 30m TF) where the 123 has taken a day or two to form so point 3 happening around market open rather than a 123 forming at current market price (then there are 123s on the daily or 4h timeframe, post 133, 179).  
I guess my question is what is the rule for this within the system or is it a question of experience / choice

I have a question Do you choose the resistance or support level in the high time and wait for the price to reach that level and break that level? For example, if you determine the resistance level in the 4-hour level and wait for the price to reach the 4-hour level and close the 4-hour candle?

do your own back test to find out which suits your eyes more.  
if it took a day or two for lower time frame to form, then one should be able to see it from a higher time frame.  
would you rather to have a price level coming from lower time frame or a higher one?  
  
i read the rule as per [https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...1#post14778521](https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/post/14778521#post14778521)  
i reckon making a decision from only one time frame would not be a strong one.  
it has to come from 2 time frames.  
one higher, one lower.  
the higher giving the price level and direction, the lower narrowing it down for a trade entry.  
see the image in the next post.

when price pullback to a SR level in higher time frame, switch to lower time frame to narrow down for a trade entry.  
you do not have to wait for the h4 candle close when the 3 conditions are fulfilled.  
hope the following image can answer your query.

Hi Craigl,  
My trading times are posted on the thread somewhere.  
I start at 3.00 until 4.30  
Pro's were pushing market up to fill short positions prior to market open, a sell was the only choice here at 3.00

Tokoyo opens at 0200, that's true. Sydney opens even before that.  
However majority of the Asia (HK, SG, China, etc) open at 0300.  
Hence, big money starts flowing from 0300. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

So, when the price reaches the high time level, we don't wait until it closes At that moment, we go ltf

Hi C76,  
Sometimes you will get a move from the 1.30 and 4.30 open /close candle, however I feel more confident with the 3.00 market activity. 

Your trade order needs to be in the right place at the right time.

Hi Traders,  
Just to clarify why I took the EA trade this morning.  
I used the 1hr Line chart for a pullback to resistance.  
It may go down further to 6640 / 42 which is 4hr support

Here's my rookie mistake I made today.  
  
Didn't see any trades I'd like, but I noticed this one. I entered it later than I should've, therefore, my maximum 10-pip SL wasn't below the candle.   
  
I have a line in my plan "if for some reason you're late for a trade or a wick is too large, you can place an order with an appropriate SL." — this would have prevented this mistake and I would be in BE already.  
  
I'm not beating myself for it, but it's a great example of what intrusive thoughts can do.

Yes, I should probably avoid trading the sessions with upcoming red news. I was hoping to be able lock BE before the news came out

A mixed day today - finished +5R.  
  
AU - Took long trade start of London session for 7R. I could have ridden this out for more and should have let it run till 4HR resistance. I wasn't entirely sure on this trade from the outset as the price was resisting yesterday's NY session high. Leaned towards respecting the more recent support vs yesterdays highs.  
  
EU - Took a short during London from a zone I had marked out after NY session. Saw a bullish rejection candle from the zone only for SL to be hit a few candles later. Didn't register the forming 123 which might have saved the trade and set up a nice run at the start of NY session.  
  
EJ - Saw bullish rejection during the London session, long wick which was tested a few candles later and hit SL. Trade would have gone on to hit BE but I was no longer on the train.  
  
How far back are others drawing zones on LTF drawn - Is it better to focus on the day movements vs looking back?

hi all, first poster here.  
I started a trade-explore on a demo account few days ago. no indicator trade, all manual, managed to grab more than 170 pips and recover the %10 loss I made yesterday, and land in a %5+ profit overall. just traded based on news and pairs correlations. hopefully my next days will be similar or at least steady profits on monthly periods for this demo, gives me courage to move to my real account. wish me luck/skill/patience.

don't know whether you are a new trader.  
  
but here's a list of mistakes they often made.  
1\. big lot sizes resulting in 10% loss 10% win.  
2\. add on to losses with big lots (revenge trading?)  
3\. breaking rules now and then, which becomes a bad habit instead of building up consistency.  
4\. not waiting for market open.  
5\. not doing higher time frame analysis.  
6\. trading without stop loss.

EJ trade from today; ADR was deeply surpassed so waited for reversal at 4HR levels.  
First trade hit SL. Saw a bearish rejection on candle just before NY open, took long trade on NY open which hit SL.   
Took trade again as NY open candle finished on bearish rejection near 4HR support.   
Ended +6R.  
  
Didn't take GU trade - had SL greater than 10pips based on my lines, opportunity missed.

Good morning traders,   
Please I am on an inquiry concerning DXY. Is there a place of using it to measure the direction and strength of USD pairs either as a quote or base currency or is it unnecessary? Kindly pardon me if the question is foolish and your insight(s) are appreciated.

Hey everyone,  
It seems I am still not familiar with session times. Some sites show that NY session is already open now, but other sites show that it will only be open the next hour (I don't want to post links here). Could someone who really knows proper session times show me site or something to check and see which sessions are currently open and when the other ones are going to open? Sorry for such an amateur question, but I am surprised that even some of the most popular fx sites show different results.

Slow and mixed day for me;  
  
AU net 1.5R. Entered short on the start of London which then got stopped out. Re-entered at end of London session for mode BE to 2.5R just ahead of NY session. TCL (#396) is broken so the view will be bearish until the TCL is breached by an impulse move.  
  
UJ net -1R. Long trade was taken during the London session, which was counter to 4h downtrend so always higher risk and lower % success. Price bounced of resistance so felt like there was an opportunity but continued to drop before rebounding back up.

Hi Hanz,  
The problem you have with your trade entries is you are entering trades in the Dead Zone.  
If you continue to do this you will fail.  
Trades are to be opened in the first 1.5hrs of market open.  
So, no more trades out of these times and lets see what you can do.  
  
Regards  
Rob

Got into couple of trades during London session. Seemed like a nice setup I was confident in, already moved to BE. However, I only set it to 5,5R as this is the most I could take in this trade without doubting it.  
  
Update: both trades hit BE

Thanks for your asnwer. However, what threw me off is when Rob wrote that the market is already open at 9AM (my time), although FF shows it only opens at 10AM (my time). What am I not understanding here? I want to be sure that I'm working during the right 1,5 hours ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f605.png?v=15.1)

Hi,  
I know all folks are busy bee here. But I have some confusion about drawing S/R peaks and troughs. If we draw peaks and troughs, we can't draw every peaks and troughs right? Or is there a specific rules to draw HTF peaks and troughs? This may be very stupid question and I know somewhat funny. But I am very rookie. Free feel to comments and guide me. Sorry for my   
Poor English.

if too many lines confuse you, then only draw those around current market price.  
probably 2 or 3 htf lines.  
the htf location below has only 2 occurrence for this week.  
then you drop down to the ltf entry.

trading is but having the patience to wait for one good trade.  
if there is no confirmation in ltf, then there is no trade. and so be it.

so far there is no ltf set up.  
but are we 'surprised' by the down move?

success will come to those who possess patience in them to wait for the one good trade.

how does one able to trade with big lots unless one is proficient, tested many times and confident in winning 75% of the time?  
what is the percentage of traders in FF able to do that?

Aiming for 5R. Moved to BE. We'll see how it goes. For those wondering why the stop loss zone is so small: I reduced it in LTF.  
  
Update: TP hit

Took a continuation of EU short at the 90th min mark of NY session, took a few weeks off glad to be back. This week should be exciting given all the upcoming news ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Took a few trades where the SL was too narrow and got hit (twice), loosened for third trade on AU to et 7R, to finish day on 4R.  
  
AU seems to be ranging from Friday's highs and lows, which was confirmed during the Asain session with a bearish rejection of Low and march up to high. Took a short during London waiting for the run back down to low which was roughly 7R. Figured there were two options here - either aim to the bottom of the range or shoot up and flip R to S with a trade on the pullback.

The HTFs (H4 and D1) were showing bearish bias. If you only looked at the M30 / M15 in isolation you would have been possibly misled

its a lot easier with hindsight ... but that is how we learn to read our charts, ... next time when you see price peaks and valleys, you will be better prepared for ALL possible things to happen.

let's see what will happen during frankfurt london open.  
come on traders, throw out some **htf level to observe together**.  
we learn much more when the action is happening in front of our eyes.  
how to handle situations when things are in our favor or against us.  
even things do not work out according to plan, we can still learn from them.  
not much use showing after things had already happened.  
let's go to the next level.  
what matters is traders' participation.

It seems like you're detailing a trading system based on identifying support and resistance levels across multiple time frames, with a focus on using rejection candles as entry signals rather than relying on traditional indicators like moving averages or MACD crossovers. This approach emphasizes price action and market sentiment rather than lagging indicators.

Thanks but I have TP at 4R  
I'm busy in the European session so I can't trade. If I wasn't busy, I would have entered the same order as you

Great trade - I was eyeing this up but had to step away from the terminal for longer than expected and missed it.

To start with, there was a bearish impulse move with a prior low taken out. It was a poor quality trade.  
Stick with it and post your next trades and you will get help.  
Take a look at this option for yesterdays London open.  
Impulse move up, pullback prior to market open (Pro's gathering volume, market open then boom away it goes)  
This is what I have shown here multiple times.

i would like to recommend an alternative view that**before** you pull your trigger, check what the higher time frame is telling you.  
in this case what a single htf candle (impulse/engulf/wide range candle) is showing you.

Hey everyone again,  
  
This may be a bit off-topic question, but does anyone trade Sydney session here? It opens before I go to sleep, so I could trade for an hour or so. However, it seems to be way less active than london and NY. Is it worth trading during Sydney and which pairs are best for it?

Hi All,  
  
I’m currently looking for a simple trading system which I can trade using just my mobile (MT4), due to my current situation. Do you think it would be possible using just a mobile?  
  
Thanks.

Are you thinking there might be a long opportunity from current support (6669-6634) after that impulse move up to 67800?

You trade by waiting for the price to reach key levels during the market opening session to enter an order  
Or wait for the price to reach the key level and have a rejection candle to enter the order without needing the market opening time

Today is the first day that I've stopped being a lunatic and FOMOing into 3-4 trades per session and instantly benefited. Waited for that one trade that looked picture-perfect on the line chart. Took me a few weeks to realise 90% of my trades were low-quality FOMO moves.

Yea, was taking a break earlier hence the lower frequency of posts. Slowly easing back into the groove. I hope that all that have been shared so far here has been beneficial to you. Do post and ask questions if you have any doubts. We'll be around to clarify ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

A fine application of the rules, that said, I had the zone of interest much lower down, pretty much where it bounced from. On the 15min, there is a slight blip on the way up however this doesn't show on the 30min chart, sometimes worth checking the the HTF to see if the history that defines a support or resistance zone is solid.  
  
I had a support zone lower down that had multiple touch points on the 15 and 30 min timeframes which is where the trade could have been taken however was outside my 90min window.

Your trade entry looks to be in the Dead Zone!  
Correct entry on chart

Adding onto what Rob already mentioned, your trade was placed right smack in the middle of the barren dead zone between London and NY sessions. Only look for entries between a session open to 90 mins since open.  
  
You can refer to his preferred entry during the LDN session. I took one in the NY session shared earlier which is shown later in the screenshot

I trade 3.00 - 4.30 Terminal time everyday which is 8am WST / 11.00am Sydney time

Made sense! Trading with variety of time frames definitely helps. Will keep postings until no more loses to post ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

London open at 7pm on my time zone ( Melbourne time). So I usually trade from 7 to 8.30 pm. Didn't bother to look before 7pm. Did I miss something???  
  
Edit: I've been trading wrong london time zone. That explains why I have higher win rate with asian session than london session. Silly me!

The trade was placed on market open if you were looking at M30, signal candle is immediate previous candle.

I don't get it. If tokyo opens at 11pm my local time, should I open a trade before or after 11am?  
  
Edit: I got the idea of impul move before market open. Re-write everything and start practing. Thanks guys

Thank you very much. I understand but there are words I don't understand because I'm in a country that doesn't speak English. I used google translate so the translation is not very accurate. Thanks for your help

looks like you have a sell bias and have the 'resistance' drawn to support your sell bias.  
  
did you do your top down support and resistance according to post #1?

Sometimes a Trade just doesnt work out and you need to accept that losses are part of the game.  
  
You cant make money without losing some.  
It's a business expense.  
  
Instead of asking yourself why you got stopped out, ask yourself whether you followed your Trading Plan or not.  
  
If you did, good job. Next Trade will be a win (or maybe not)  
  
If you didnt, then you should ask yourself why you didnt.  
  
You can always make up reasons in hindsight why something didnt work, but the Market just has randomness to it (a lot).  
  
We can control when to toss the coin, but we cant control the outcome.  
  
Emmanuel seems to be one of those that give great advice when everything has happened already. 

The subconscious mind is in control, not the conscious mind.

you won't be asking this question if you fully understand post 1.  
you will be missing a lot if you do not reread the whole thread again, only this time more carefully.

which higher time frame you see that can back up your m5 direction?  
that time frame is much more important than your m5 time frame.

good question ... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

there is a BTC Storyline which goes back to February Month-End close.... but more recently is this post

I draw the SnR lines manually using scripts with date and time stamp, plus different colour for timeframes.  
  
when mouse over the lines, it will show the details of the SnR in this example below

Thanks. but I don't understand your System  
I feel it's easier to understand OP's System  
I'm not in an English speaking country, I use google translate for everything so I don't fully understand what's being said here.

My first post in 10 years. Islandfx911 your contribution to this site/thread is truly a sight to behold! take notice all. Your never too old to learn something new that jives with your mental framework. Personally have read through your thread over the last few days to soak up your craft and I am impressed. What I find underrated is that fact that one can pick excellent R/R in traffic (ie choppy periods). Maybe i'm drawing too many lines here? but I took eur/usd long at UK open, moved stop to breakeven when when R/R was 2/1. One question, do you avoid or reduce positions when key "red" economic numbers are pending. Thanks again!

UJ looks like it has a big opportunity still in the day with the current daily range well short of ADR.  
  
Saw a short opportunity which hit SL, the price retarded back to that level and then found support. 4Hr in a really tight range hovering around all-time high.  
  
Looking for either a short from 15min upper box or push up and bounce off that level.

Here is one more of UJ. Impulse move south from all time highs, hits the support, rebounds and then rejection candle brings it back to the support. I could not take this trade but this was a classic and quick one.  
  
Update: Price took out every support on the way and crashed down hard. I managed to take some profit of the total move, not all or most of it. See chart 2 attached.

BTC failed to break the HH@ 71,555 formed a LH instead and a retest at the zone of interest. Probable short trade is envisaged. Kindly share your thoughts

**BTC Mar27 pick the 'best' SnR with price action and HTF confluence**  
  
\- a H4 Marubozu candle provided a price bounce   
  
\- NYO pushed price to +7R only to pull back to close +5R  
  
\- then the 'sellers' rushed in to fill orders ... lots of orders below

\- remember Line chart is Close price !  
  
\- low liquidity period   
  
\- just keep watch and do not lose rhythm of the market and keep in-sync

Here is a possible 1-2-3 formation on UJ H1. This is a trade in progress. Price got rejected at resistance. We have a nice H1 rejection candle and it is possibly now en route to or below 2.

i won't be in a hurry to short.  
try to look at as many time frames as possible.  
and of course the time of day.  
patience is the key.

Hi, long time no see.  
  
Found out that even with 2 trades per session I was overtrading and getting into non-ideal scenarios. I finally learned to be OK without making a single trade in a day if I don't see one. I work full-time from home and check charts every day, I see strong breakouts that I would have traded earlier to avoid missing out, but the setup is either not valid in HTF or a complete 1-2-3 doesn't appear.  
  
Today is thursday, and this is only my 2nd trade this week (the first one was BE). This one is also at BE already, so it's better to sit on my hands than collecting stop losses day after day. I hope to be able to find better trades by taking fewer of them.  
  
(The entry was a bit late though)  
  
BTW, I recommend turning the profit tab off. I've done it a few weeks ago, and not seeing your profit/loss ranging is lighter on your head.  
  
Update: +5R TP hit

\- will this week close above 71000 is the big question

Update: The 3 has managed to keep its place so far. I exited at about 9 pips on my short because the pair is ranging badly. Waiting for a breakout, pullback and then an opportunity to enter.

> Hi, long time no see. Found out that even with 2 trades per session I was overtrading and getting into non-ideal scenarios. I finally learned to be OK without making a single trade in a day if I don't see one. I work full-time from home and check charts every day, I see strong breakouts that I would have traded earlier to avoid missing out, but the setup is either not valid in HTF or a complete 1-2-3 doesn't appear. Today is thursday, and this is only my 2nd trade this week (the first one was BE). This one is also at BE already, so it's better to...

those with day jobs should be trading once a day and avoid intraday trading in LTF.  
  
I did back testing with EURGBP Daily chart for the period from Jan 2018 to Mar 2024,   
  
it performed well from 2018 to 2020, but not so good since 2021 ...  
  
better to focus on the USD pairs on Daily chart and trade once a day at London Open and Risk:Reward 1:5   
  
and avoid the Eur and Gbp Cross pairs

Couple of shorts i entered during the open of Tokyo session. I went short on AUDUSD too but SL was hit, if you rentered 30 minutes after the open you should find a nice resistance zone + 4H S/R confluence, should have been more patient with that. I didn't re-enter because I already had 3 trades running, didn't want to over-extend myself.  
  
Update: Both AJ 5.6R and GJ 6R full tp hit

AJ. my thought process before trade entry.  
always start your analysis from w1, what it tells you.  
a lot of intra day traders ignore the weekly or the monthly.  
the weekly aligns with the monthly up trend. this week may be reaching to last week high.  
move down one time frame at a time.  
the daily range showed a bounce from below 50 fib to above.  
the h4 shows potential long set up.  
now waiting for frankfurt and london open with my entry time frame for long set up. if none then no trade.  
keeping in mind this week target is last week high, as intra day trader expectation, probably the target could be previous day or session high.

I'm using the same technique, so happy that s.o is using too. but if you put a Stoch-RSI this will make your rate more increaseable!

aj. m5 entry set up.  
would either partial TP and put balance to BE or full TP, especially so for large lot position size.

aj BE hit.  
so it is appropriate to apply a scalping strategy on such a ranging day.  
however also be aware that asia low has been taken and if bounce up from there, there is still a chance that the day TP may be reached.

wrb is a momentum move showing strength.  
often a result of major news although not always the case.  
it is equivalent to ICT fair value gap.  
when fvg got invalidated opposite move can occur.

to learn some of the challenges with wide range bars you will need to take a trip back to May 2014 link below:  
  
[https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...62#post7445362](https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/post/7445362#post7445362)  
  
download the tutorial pdf in that post.  
  
like all things in trading forex, nothing works is 100%.   
  
but here we are day trading, we get in and out within the same market session therefore those WRB in lower timeframes can mean a lot different things.

My technical observations are :-  
\- the Average Daily trading range has dropped quite significantly to below 50pips   
\- the intraday volatility has taken out most small SL of 10pips and TP 50pips has very few hits  
\- very few consecutive trending days   
  
of course there are fundamental reasons,   
some may say the Ukraine war being one of the reasons  
post-Brexit impact  
interest rate   
  
etc.

it is a Money Management Strategy using the same setup candle and different Risk-Reward.  
The Risk is always the same but different Reward.  
The higher the Reward the lower the Win Rate.  
  
You can trade manually and have your own rules-based discretionary trading, you can for example eliminate some setups with your own trading experience, and also have your own re-entry on the same day in cases when the first trade got stopped out at -1R.  
You can also have the option to roll-over the trade to the next day when you have profit locked say at +3R and fight the following day for +5R, +9R and +12R ... those trade with +9R and +12R are big winners.  
  
You need to frequently check 'losing streaks' your consecutive losing trades -1R and the prevailing market conditions ... these losing streaks can wipe out the big winners.   
  
Read the OP's post. He had shown many +7.5R trades That's his winning edge.  
  
I focus on +5R trades. Anything more is bonus.  
  
There are many different scenarios when we are trading live market, ... therefore we are here to post charts and share our thoughts and how to get in and get out of the market.  
  
  
  
...

ta-da. the target made at the beginning of the week has been hit.  
if there is no jpy intervention, the next target will be the week high.  
the low of the week has been set.

Hey everyone,  
  
So, I've been testing this strategy for a month (bear in mind that I am a complete beginner). **During the first month I achieved +19R** overall (55 trades). I always set my SL to BE when the price is in the middle between the entry point and the TP. However, I kept journaling all my trades and noticed that moving my SL to BE when the price moves to +1R would have brought me +25R (maybe even more because I can't trace a dozen negatvie trades properly).  
  
**So, I had 10 profitable deals and 45 losses/BEs.**  
  
I'm not changing anything for the upcoming month, except the stop loss game - I think I will move it to BE when I reach +1R.  
  
I believe that many of you are tracking your trades. What's your success rate with this strategy and did you add any rules of your own?

do not classify BEs together with losses, this will affect psychologically. even 1 pip profit is a win.  
do not compare with others as each risk adverse is different, also the same with entry and exit. all different greed and fear.  
you have to work out your very own way to trade which you are comfortable with after proficiency on the basics.

**"I always set my SL to BE when the price is in the middle between the entry point and the TP."**  
  
In the percentage %Risk 'R' model with Position Sizing what is your TP for your trades.  
  
IF, your TP is set at +7.5R and you move when price is middle between Entry Price and Take Profit, then your rule is to move SL to BE when price closed above 50% of 7.5R i.e. +3.25R level.   
This can be automated using the expert advisor by the OP in post #324.

Hey,  
  
Thanks for your comment about the expert advisor, I didn't know that such tool exists. It would save me a ton of time.  
  
I am trading during London and NY opens, and pairs are EURGPB, EURJPY, USDCHF, NZDUSD, EURUSD, USDJPY, GBPUSD, AUDUSD.  
  
All trades ranged from 4R to 7R, depending on how far the next SNR was (mostly 5R).

New to the thread but I've been working on including HTF SnR zones lately and it's been working well. Fascinating to read through how others are getting on with a similar strategy. I really like my charts nice and clean and it feels a bit slower paced trading this way too which I also prefer!

Having traded for over 20 plus years your system is basically what I use,all indicators lag to me price is king. Very good of yourself to show your system and all free, do not let the knockers get you down.SR and watching news closely gives one a huge advantage.Some charts I see people have more indicators that just all they do is blur the reality of the price action, total confusion, again well done for a good simple system, thank you.

liquidity can be found around:  
\- relatively equal highs and lows  
\- the highs and lows of sessions, day, week, month  
  
for a high probability trade, align the entry time frame direction with the direction of the higher time frames.

EU Apr05 review  
  
\- that NFP H1 candle closed a Wide Range Bar WRB and   
  
\- its also partially 'filled' the previous green WRB ,  
  
\- its the next candle which completely 'filled' the bullish WRB  
  
\- NFP H1 candle became the next WRB   
  
\- looks like a 2B setup in LTF

hi Craig  
  
AJ trade was my usual 4H Swing following H4,Daily and Weekly price action and top down analysis.  
  
I use the higher TF WRB Analysis for my trade planning only which help me see the potential of market running into the WRB zones and fill the WRB.  
  
I do not look at WRB in lower TFs below H1.  
  
Study the pdf in post[#1494 ](https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/post/14815680#post14815680) linked.

Hello Islandfx911,  
  
I need guidance regarding Stop Loss. I mean where one should place the SL when we enter into a trade especially in Gold and Crude. I have some understanding of RRR but it is difficult to practice due to emotional reasons / preferential bias.

everyday you only need full focus on one shot one kill:  
1\. one pair  
2\. one pattern  
3\. one session open  
  
**lower time frame direction and location = higher time frame direction and location**  
**everyday is just a repetition**  
**no secret**

That 1H support is also overlapping with the 4H FVG to the pip. What an epic pump to open the week. But unfortunately, I failed to notice.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but was this not outside the high market activity time of 90 minutes?

Thank you ITB, GU or GJ. I think I understand the pics a 1H 123 with a LTF 123 then there are 1H 123s prior to that one for buys.  
  
So if I was using that way to identify the trend, how would I know when to stop looking for buys and look for sells?  
  
And also - I guess you can combine your timeframes so using 1H with 5m for example or 4H with 15m ect. Many thanks

So if I was using that way to identify the trend, how would I know when to stop looking for buys and look for sells?  
why do you want to trade both ways? you only get yourself distracted.   
be single minded. focus only on the high probability trade.  
only trade one direction.  
you trade the direction of higher time frame.  
  
then there are 1H 123s prior to that one for buys.  
why look at so many?  
when market open, analyze the one that is most relevant and nearest to the current market price.  
look at my charts. i have only one line in each time frame.

What is the correct way to draw lines?  
And when going down to ltf, do I need to adjust the line to match the ltf?

There is no correct way to draw lines and use them as support and resistance. Use the most effective approach and use that approach consistently when you develop your own winning trading system.

hi @Shah-Baba  
  
You can learn a lot from the OP' posts and example.  
For example post #1274 M30 chart.  
[https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...4#post14789274](https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/post/14789274#post14789274)  
  
If you post some example of your Gold and Crude M30 charts, we can discuss this important topic of Stop Loss placement and hos to use trade Position Sizing. We need to consider the volatility of these non-forex pairs.  
  
Learn more here:

\- more focus on the H4 and H1 SnR levels  
  
\- today would be to pick a setup with small SL 10pips maximum  
  
\- can be a deep correction today for possible sell trade

from post 1 see how the OP adjusted the lines.  
as for myself, most time i am too lazy to do so. the most i adjust mn w1 d1 down till h4 and just leave it there.  
below h4 i also just leave it there.  
when trade entry, does not mean px has to be above h4 (as it already serve the purpose of pointing to you the up direction).  
focus on your entry time frame, where is the current market price in relation to the line you have drawn.  
so you do accordingly to your own experience.

**AJ Apr10 M30 with H1 rejection candles**  
  
\- M30 forms H1 rejction candles  
  
\- but in the 'middle' of nowhere or some sees the rejection at traditional levels  
  
\- is the SL possible with 10 pips with this as setup ?  
  
\- IF NOT, then wait for price to break above yesterday' Daily Close for a 10pips SL trade

you know that d1 direction is down.  
but are you aware that w1 direction is up?  
so you made a judgement call whether you trade counter trend on friday.  
if so expect smaller TP for counter trend.  
see how px gravitate to w1 support like a magnet?  
then shot up after completing mission.  
ok no more time left, i have to go catch my flight.

A single today's GBPUSD +7R trade. Not planning to trade during the NY session as a lot of red news are coming. Not the most beautiful entry on M5, but everything seemed great on higher time frames.  
  
Funny thing that I aimed for one +7R USDCHF trade yesterday and it went back to BE with **half a pip** left to TP ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f643.png?v=15.1)

Two reasons you can’t.  
  
1\. Slippage - The loss on the losing trade will be far more than the size of your stop. I know someone that had a three point stop in place once and got stopped out at minus 60 so a potential 20R loss on a single trade.  
  
2\. Whipsaw - After big news releases it’s not uncommon for price to move violently in one direction before moving in the other so there’s potential to be stopped out in both directions.  
  
Best to avoid the big red flag news events, it’s gambling.

I see the Market Type conditions:-  
\- Weekly is Sideways Wide Range but bullish  
\- Daily was correction with US CPI data release  
\- H4 is in consolidation after the CPI data release  
  
\- I see Daily SnR and the test of the Daily SnR with a Price Action setup close above Asian morning high

You can try this by @FerruFX  
[https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...ard-indicators](https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/418662-new-ffx-standard-indicators)  
  
I set the MA to show Line chart. It show the MA with candlesticks.  
  
There are many options with alerts which can be useful too.

Hi Traders,  
This is my last post here.  
I had hoped that there had been more of you that had traded this system and posted your results however it is evident that this system is not for you.  
Maybe one day some of you will return to see the value in thinking outside the box and see the continual availability of the higher R winning trades.  
Best wishes to all of you.  
  
I'll leave you with this mornings trade to ponder on.

Just wanted to thank you again for your efforts here. After some initial success back in jan/feb I had a losing streak using this system and lost my confidence so went away to do a bit of self reflection and also looked into malaysian snr (which someone mentioned was similar) to see if the logic behind it could highlight where I was going wrong. First month trading in the green and I'm now looking at incorporating your system to refine my entries and stretch out the rr.

great trade as it was an event triggered move  
  
waiting for indicators to give a signal is late ...  
  
those using dynamic support and resistance ... 10EMA, 50EMA, 200 EMAs would have got that trade alerts, ... two candles later,

From my experience if 1-2-3 pattern is not good and significant the trade is likely to get poor RR or stopped out occurs. Especially AUD pairs are very respect 1-2-3 during asian session. JPY pairs are not much move at Asian session.

That depends on how the trader sees the 1-2-3 price action. Different traders have different level of experience hence different set of rules. You need to have and follow some basic rules how to determine the 1-2-3 on your chart and you need to apply rules with consistency and get the result.  
  
AUDUSD volatility has changed over the last 20 years. The good years of strong AUD is over and you will not see AUD hit parity again in the next 20 years.

Since Jan 2020, with Risk:Reward 1 to 5, the growth is quite flat compare to Jan 2016 to Dec 2019.  
This means we need to consider the Daily and Weekly trading range and the volatility when we trade with Stop Loss and Position Sizing, and at the same time study the Win Rate using different Risk Reward Ratios.

According to the system described by Islandfx you should only trade the first 90 mins of a session, however he and others have alluded to bending this rule after gaining some experience.

**Apr23 review**  
  
\- trading that M15 with 7pips stop loss was a loser  
  
\- a proper 123 trade would be the break of the swing high 2  
  
\- the subsequent pull back would have invalidated the 123 trade

Maybe one day some of you will return to see the value in thinking outside the box and see the continual availability of the higher R winning trades. Best wishes to all of you.

I just discovered your incredible system yesterday. I'm an older man myself (will be 59 this year, God willing). Been trying for MANY years to become "consistently" profitable. Sadly, have never withdrawn one red cent from the market, after all these years. Not ever plan on giving up, will keep on plugging away. I've been trading something similar to this, but, after learning what you have presented, I honestly believe your strategy can be something very useful and valuable, in the long run. Thank you for sharing this with all of us and I sincerely hope you reconsider leaving. Take care and have a wonderful day. Patrick.

AU Apr29 M30 Frankfurt Open UPDATE:  
  
\- looking good but we have H4 SnR below for target ... these can stop us from getting a +5R trade ...  
  
\- best to lock-in at BE and fight for +5R  
  
\- that H4 pull-back from Weekly and Daily SnR confluence is a good setup  
  
\- and the Monthly SnR is far away for the month-end Close this week

Missing our some of the last 2 days action taking a short break.  
  
AU May03 M30 market is near a Weekly SnR (dark orange line) 6575ish.  
Price had been bullish the last 2 days and now near its previous Day high.  
  
Will be looking for a setup for the further break higher later today?

those green and red candles are H4 candles on M15 chart timeframe,  
  
these help me see the H4 Price Action on M15 chart timeframe,  
  
Example AU May21 M15 now at London 6am,

Just had a stl hit today asian session. I thought I had a great set up with bearish impulse move prior market opens ( long bias).   
  
If I look at h4 trend, it is a down trend. Then, in the pic, there is double top. Based on these, I should have gone for short. But the bearish impulse move prior market held me down. As Rod mentioned, a bearish impulse move could promote long set up and vice versa.   
  
What are your all thoughts?

Rob mentioned a few key things in his posts. The impulse move (wave) being one and then the follow through of the price action move.  
The other key thing is the market session to look for trades. He has his way to pick some of his trades - rejection candle like his last post example.  
[https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...2#post14859472](https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/post/14859472#post14859472)  
  
  
I look at the H4 candles price action, the 4-hour trade window and look for trades with small stop loss.  
  
AU May24 example below:  
\- look for setups when the H4 candle closed,   
\- look at most recent key SnR levels Daily, H4, H1,  
\- look at the price Round Numbers   
\- I do look at the commonly used moving averages 10EMA, 50EMA, 200EMA , look at the confluence of Price Action, SnR with these EMAs ...its the herd mentality.  
  
AU May24 M15 two possible trades following the H4 candles,  
you want to pick trade setup entries with small SL and RR above 1:2.

AU May29 M15  
  
\- re-entry on H1 completion , I check my charts once every 4 hour   
  
\- rejection of 4Hr SnR (green lines)  
  
\- how many 'R' profit depends on your exit strategy and trade management  
  
\- when you move your initial SL too early, most often the trades get stopped out and you will miss the +5R exit profit  
  
\- it is the Fear and Greed factor when managing trades and watching your charts  
  
\- you can consider to use the EA THV Cavemanager the OP' post in [#324](https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/post/14726213#post14726213) and manage your trades according to your exit strategy.

Another bad trade this morning.  
  
When the H4 closed bearish, do not wait ... just close with small loss.

I'm surprised you didn't look at h1 before going to the m15 as there was a bullish engulfing candle on there which would have prevented that loss. Hindsight I know, but I never go in for a trade on m15 unless both h1 and h4 agree.

I do take notice of SnR but still don't go against a candle pattern.

this thread is not about candle pattern   
  
it is about price action and support / resistance   
  
you should be reading the OP' posts, study his posts and charts, and takes notes ,  
  
if you know how to trade, then please post some charts and show us you know the 'system' here.  
  
for example his last post:

I have read his posts, they are very good, and it works really well, but I suppose the SnR can be subjective to some extent, and I don't usually look at Acad but as you mentioned it was 1hr SnR I draw the lines like this, the line was hit last night without much rejection and then came up for another go at it, even without the candles I wouldn't have taken it having a second go at it.

you got it wrong!  
  
if you have read all the OP's post and think they are very good and it works really well, then the SnR is not subjective.  
  
  
does not matter if you trade ACad or not, drawing the SnR on line chart is the same.  
  
you missed several H1 SnR.

I said I only put on the one I thought would be relevant I don't trade Acad and I am not going to sit here drawing lines for the sake of it. And in subjective I meant it can vary from person to person, everyone in this thread does not have the same snr on their charts as everybody else!

you need to read the OP' posts all over again and learn how to draw the SnR.  
  
post #1 is a good start.

on your M15 chart candles you can see the MTF H4 and H1,  
  
look at your H1 SnR levels and you will see the 'reject' candle upper wick.  
  
when you are trading the continuation of a price swing in trending market condition ... H4 > H1, then look at the H1 candle upper wicks for sell and lower wick for buy,...  
  
follow the OP' post #1 and start with HTF Daily > H4 > H1/M30 ...and plot the SnR levels using the Line chart which is the Close price and you do not see the candle High price.  
  
  
  
is this 18:00 candle the high of your H1?  
  
you need to see the high of the setup candle

The 4H was bearish as well. The 18:30 candle was rejecting the zone. So I went to the 15M timeframe for entries. The 18:45 candle looked perfect for an entry. So I took it but the stoploss was hit.

Hi Traders,  
I'm not sure why this system does not do it for you. Totally baffled really.  
After I stopped posting, a few of you have visited / posted here but mostly you have all disappeared. I have recently seen a thread called Third Candle Bounce that a few of you have taken interest which uses a similar principle to my system.  
What I don't understand is how you cannot make $ with this system.  
Maybe you are making good $ from this system but don't want to post.  
Trust me, there is no magic indicator that will make trading work for you.  
My system is SnR pullback trading, 123 Setups, Impulse / Pullback all during hours of increased market activity. They are easy to spot and profit from.  
The market moves in waves, I am not a genius that has figured out all the secrets of the market.  
I have not traded for some time now due to health and a recent death in the family but just wanted to post this chart for you all.  
As always have a great weekend, tell your loved ones you love them and don't take life too serious.  
  
Regards  
Rob

we do not know how much is your level of understanding at the moment.  
i think the best way for you to learn is to post a chart according to your own understanding of the rejection candle.  
then the rest of us can post their views according to your chart.  
only then you will know whether your understanding is right or wrong.  
if you do not post a chart, then you will never know.

i assume that you bought at the arrowed candle pointing upward in your chart because you had drawn a support line but later broken, and it failed if your SL is below it.  
now refer to here [https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...2#post14667882](https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/post/14667882#post14667882)  
it mentioned "A support zone is established using the high and close of the support candle."  
it became a support candle because it was broken and a candle closed above it and later pullback to the same level.  
you only buy when a candle tested that level and closed above it, which became the rejection candle.  
i do not see that in your chart. so that is not a rejection candle.  
the example below is showing a late retest.

in trending market conditions, the H1 and H4 candles are important to see the wicks which forms the Lower High + Lower Close  
  
look at the H1 candle upper wick when you trade the M30 entry  
  
you missed the SL by a few pips.

intraday trading the high impact news/data like the NFP  
  
when you trade M30 take the SnR from the H4 ...  
  
trading on Friday Jun07 when there is NFP, better look at the higher timeframe for possible direction and the NFP Forecast.  
If the Forecast is better than the previous month's data, I trade the pro-dollar bias.   
When the Actual is better than the Forecast, then the analysts were wrong and you have a runaway train or a falling knife trade.  
  
The H4 'rejection' is after your little blue arrow., and hours before NFP data release.  
H4 SnR is 155.22ish  
The H4 demand zone / 'support' 155.36 was tested at LTF before the NFP release.

hi Rob  
  
Most will fail because they cannot trade like you. Its the 3Ms of trading.  
  
They have not develop their own winning systems with your basic Price Action + SnR trading. ... the Method.  
PA+SnR trading is one of the 3-M's ... less than 5% of a winning system.   
  
The 35% is the 2nd M ... Money Management which include the Risk Management aspects,  
  
The 3rd M is the Mind 60%, ... aka the trader's psychology which the mental strategies of the trader  
  
Simply put, most do not have the experience which they need to build their confidence. Experience take time, ... years of active trading the markets. You know this as you and I have been trading for many years in FF. I took the big leap in 2018 and removed the last two indicators - Stochastics and TDI, from my charts. This was exactly what [@eelfranz](https://www.forexfactory.com/eelfranz) did when he and I were trading the 5-Method way back in the 90's.

My last nine(9) months Sep 2023 to May 2024 <[here](https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/post/14893915#post14893915) >  
and I only trade once every 4 hours following the Weekly and Daily charts.  
Once every 4 hours I can place my trades on any LTF chart, M30, M15, M5, based on you PA+SnR method, I prefer M5 as I automated may of my trading processes.  
  
  
Point here is for everyone to work harder at it. Be yourself, you cannot be like some one else.

Hi Em, Your quote sums it up. If you want something bad enough you have to be prepared to push harder.  
  
  
![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Your trade order needs to be in the right place at the right time.

Hit STL.  
What are you all opinions on this trade?  
  
I'm only posting my loses. I've been having a couple wins as well. But my win rate ratio is quite low around 50%. So until this rate is > 70%, I'll keep posting my loses.

\- nothing to trade for me as I follow the H4 before I take any trade setup entry on M15.  
\- H4 was sideways during London open session and when New York open so better to stay away  
\- wait for H4 to show higher-high with higher Close,then the pullback for the LTF setup and entry  
or  
\- H4 to lower low with lower Close then the pullback for LTF setup and entry  
  
**UJ Jun 12 M30**  
  
\- today is FOMC and be prepared for some volatility

A big Kudos to Rob for sharing his trading 101% of his trading system. Not many would do same thing if in a similar scenario. If God blesses me with a son, I'm definitely naming him Rob after you. Thanks so much.  
UsdCad M15 setup after NFP release looks juicy and Stoploss currently adjusted to +3. It's a 4.5r.   
  
Wanna get a good grasp of your system before I start gunning for 7.5r like you and other followers here as well.  
  
I wish you good health in this difficult time sir.

Hello,  
  
i read the WHOLE thread, it is very nice and clear, i like it and I would like to try this strategy. My only problem is that i work (far from office and PC) 9 hours a day. I have with me only the mobile phone where i can use MT4 mobile.  
So, for me there are two chances, 1) I use the mobile phone during european session (i am from europe) and i check the market until 1,5 hr the open of european market, and i use the mobile phone with mt4 or 2) i use this strategy on bigger time frame, like 4hr o daily tf.  
This strategy to be successful has to be trade only for 1,5 hours after the open of the market. So i don't know if it works using higher time frame like 4 hr o daily tf.  
Any suggestion?  
  
Thanks!  
Mirko

your qualification to trade is during european session using d1 and h4.  
the example shows the d1 resistant and h4 pattern, but far away back in may.  
and in those time frames, there was no pattern found in the current market price.  
the current market price tells your the price action at the moment and is used to precise trade entry.  
you still have to make use of lower time frames to find the pattern.  
even the h1 did not present one during european session.  
however the pattern was found in m15.  
when price was around the d1 h4 h1 during european session, one should be watching out for the m15 pattern.  
however you still have the choice of not using the lower time frames.  
in that case the entry will be when the h4 candle closed below the h4 pattern, which would not be a good entry point.

hi Mirko  
  
I trade mainly once every 4hours. I have my trading platforms running in my PC based VPS and I can access remotely using my mobile broadband connection all the time when I am not at home or at my business office.   
  
The best trading hours are between London 6am up to the London close. But I do find some trades during the Tokyo morning session. You will find some trade before Frankfurt open, one hour before London opens.  
  
I post some charts below to show how I look for trades on M15 charts looking at the H4 and Daily candles price action.  
I think with your trading experience you will understand these charts easily.

hi @nguyentrict  
  
In this thread the OP only use Line chart and Candlestick chart.  
  
I have also the HeikenAshi HA candles turned off when I post here. This will help readers learn to read the Japanese candlesticks and learn to read the price action.  
  
My personal preference is the Average Price Bar/ HeikenAshi APB/HA candles with Bar chart.  
  
Take note here, the OP' trading style is far more advanced than @eelfranz (aka Big E) in the Trading Made Simple thread.   
The OP Rob and I were trading Big E' 5-Method for many years and he has move ahead with his personal trading style removing all indicators and now he is 'naked trading'.

Why the price did not respect the recently formed zone and went for the zone before that. Can somebody tell me why this happened.

If price respects the levels we will be in range forever.

Dear Island,  
  
I very rarely come to read this board, but I've accidently stumbled across this thread - albeit probably too late. I would just like to express my gratitude for all tutors on FF who conduct themselves as you have; showing patience, and grace whilst teaching. Your teaching style reminds me much of Pipeasy (RIP)  
  
regards  
  
Fax 

Just for today, do not worry...

**EJ Jun 19 UPDATE:**  
  
**-** trade once every 4hours, the Frankfurt Open and London Open in the next 4 hours, then Tokyo Close during the London session,   
  
\- many things happens every hour ...  
  
\- the 4Hr candle will close soon and the next 4Hr will open  
  
\- H4 are small candles  
  
\- good to check the Daily candles Price Action and see if we can find a trade based on Daily candle OHLC levels  
  
\- Daily spinning top candle means it can go either way ... swing high / swing low / etc.

**EJ Jun19 M15 Tokyo Close**  
  
\- IF you waited for the Tokyo close and the 4Hr candle also closed   
  
\- we have a nice H4 pullback candle setup from the Weekly SnR 169.25  
  
\- you can still find a M15 entry with small stop loss.

Emmanuel you are very sharp in your entry and analysis, I would like to learn more about your trading style. Unfortunately, as I wrote here few days ago, I don't have time to check the market during the day, I can go lower on timeframe no more than 4hr tf.

EJ Jun19 UPDATE London 12PM  
  
\- today is US bank holidays so we take this into consideration  
  
\- IF it can reach the ADR High before London session closes today, it would be +7.5R trade like Rob'  
  
\- I would be happy to close at yesterdays' high +4.5R to +5R

Good morning, I would like to describe 2 trades that I placed on the USDJPY this morning at London open at 8.00am (a LONG which failed), and then another at 08.30am ( a SHORT which was a success). My BIAS changed from LONG to a SHORT in a single candle, and I wondered if (a) participants on this forum had these moments with 30m (b) please feel free to critique the analysis. (c) please feel free to add anything else.  
  
I would like to show my analysis, and hoping that it would inspire a conversation, and what goes on in a traders mind  
  
_**WHY LONG?**_  
I note an area of SR. candles 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 are showing Resistance.  
Several candles show support: candles 8 and two more candles to the right  
Back to Resitance with candkes 9, 10,11, 12  
candle 13 breaks higher, and it's tail is showing support  
I am aware that there is a BRN of 159.00 above (also giving Resistance), but I want to use the system as Vanilla as decribed  
  
7.30am-8.00am - as we approach London open, after candle 14 (0800) is painted and completed. It looks like a LONG, so I enter immediately at London open, with a small stop (3-4 pips), but it stopped out shortly. that's ok, that's part of the system.

_**WHY SHORT?**_  
  
8.00-8.30am. After candle 15 (at 0830) is completed, I see the upper tails, and my bias changes and take the decision that the the trade is a SHORT, and see the 3 mini tails above (from last 3 candles). Despite the longer tail below suggesting that it may continue to go long, my overbearing thought was that the last 3x30minute candles could not break through the Resistance. This coupled with Island's words that this is the market makers manipulating the market. I comfortably took the short, with a small stop, and it hit a target  
  
  
  
TARGET: my target was initially 7.5:1 as Island says, but I reduced it slightly to a previous swing Low.  
  
question: (1) Were any of these two trades valid? (2) how many other traders change their bias in a single candle? (3) any other points of view? (4) was this a fluke?  
  
Fax.  
  
update 2:Looking back at these 2 trades, it was so clear why the short was a better trade. My trading bias had kicked in. Those small tails at the top when I was looking for a LONG became almost invisible, but they were the small footprints that suggested a SHORT. The footsteps were there......

if you are willing to learn and see from another perspective, put aside the market open requirement for this moment, just showing a model .............  
  
how confident are you to enter a buy just by solely looking at m5?  
it was a snrc support and resistant continuation model or resistant turned support flip as per this thread.  
will you be more confident if there was a m15 engulfing?  
what about with the h1 engulfing?  
so do not ever miss out checking the higher time frames.  
  
by using htf engulfing is just one perspective ....... there are others yet to be explored ..........

a direct live application of a m5 set up backed up by m15/m30 engulf.  
with 30pips and 40pips during market open, some traders can already be in 1,2,3% ........ equity profit during the asia session and can call it a day.

This Line Chart uses _MA in Color_ with setting EMA 1 On MT4. This gives the color change. The dashed lines above and below the price line show the range of wicks . The price patterns listed on the chart.. Batman from Stacy Burke Quasimodo from I believe InTheBox and TTO from Rob Smith are highlighted. I changed to line charting because it is easier on the eyes and the brain... for me.

Good morning everyone,   
  
I've been practicing this strategy since January and didn't post anything for a few months here. For anyone doubting OP's strategy - it works, but you have to put effort into it. I've been tweaking and backtesting the no indicator strategy, but recently noticed that I made a full circle and settled with the strategy that's nearly identical to OP's.  
  
I am manually backtesting the strategy throughout 2022, and over the course of three months, my **average monthly return is 24%**. I always set a 7,5R TP but regularly get stopped out for 5-7 days in a row, so I am able to notice winning trades, but I'm still tripping on stop losses a lot. I guess I should focus more on higher time frames maybe.  
  
Anyway, thanks again Island for this and wish everyone patience! Here are a few results of my recent manual backtesting:

Hi E,  
Your trades are spot on. Well Done. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1) You have shown everyone on this forum what can be achieved by being committed and **believing in yourself and the system**  
Average monthly return folks is **24%**  
Maybe people will start to realize the huge potential of trading the way I have shown.  
Well Done once again and I look forward to more of your posts.  
Regards Rob

Hi M,  
My philosophy is to not give in and fight back.   
Posting the odd chart and helping others keeps me sane.

the w1 high resistant could be a factor.

Maybe I should have waited for 4H candle rejection but went on with the 1H rejection cause AUD was bullish after the CPI.

that's right earlier aud news.  
not watching the higher time frames daily, weekly will be in peril.

you were too hurried. there was no clear set up.  
the m30 has to close properly above the m30 resistant.

that's a d1 resistant requiring d1 candle to close above.  
compare my m30 chart, was the 2nd last candle **very clearly** closed above the resistant or sitting on the fence?  
if not clear, do not force trade.

Start winning!   
  
I believe this trading style has made my lifestyle becoming better, no more sitting in front of computer all day. 1.5 hours every session. Once you place your trade, wait until it hit either sl or tp. 123, pullback, impulse. Again, like ITB said, gotta be clear, if not, don't trade or trade with risk.   
  
Thanks Rob and ITB.

Hi Traders,  
Just thought I'd give GU a go. It had a small bounce of minor support.  
The TP is 8R so worth a go.  
  
Update: Trade is at +1  
Moved to +3  
Out of trade at +3

just an opinion.  
switching time frames around would give a better picture.  
you see the d1 red candle closed above support.  
using the higher time frame h1 and new york open for entry would be more convincing.

Thanks ITB. I understand how you plotted the 4H and 1H to get the set up, its beautiful. How did you see the daily support please?  
I plot lines on the daily peaks and troughs to see daily SR – I would have used the one higher up  
Do you plot the rectangles on the line and candlestick chart also?

i like to draw htf support resistant using candle high low and close rally base drop.  
for the rbd if you find too many lines, you can refine week with day. day with h4.  
let's look at what happened last week circled in d1. i had hightlighted 5 zones in h4.  
there were further 3 zones in h1.  
what do you think? are you able to enter a trade in h1?  
if not, go further down to lower time frames and look at these 8 zones.  
you can draw horizontal lines on line chart, rectangles on the candlestick chart with the high low to the body range.

Hi Em,  
What you have just posted sums up the system and what is required to successful.  
Planning and preparation for the trading week is essential.

Hi Traders,  
I have had some messages regarding the system and wanted to post charts on how I do my weekend analysis.  
There may be differences between the way Em and I plot SnR on our charts but the end result should be the same.  
If you have any questions please ask and Em, ITB or myself will likely answer.  
  
First chart is Monthly.  
I have plotted what I class as the major SnR and plotted rectangles where multiple touches have occurred.  
At this point I want to say ALL support and resistance on your charts is important.  
You will note that there are some peaks and troughs that have gone trough the SnR lines I have plotted. (I will get to these in a bit)

The next chart is Weekly.  
I have left the rectangles that were plotted on the Monthly chart so you can see them on the lower time frames.  
As you can see the lines are pretty close to the line chart peaks and troughs.  
At this stage I have not moved any lines.

Now I am going to start to fine tune the SnR.  
You have to remember that plotting SnR does not have to be exact, you may plot a line on a different peak or trough than what we would. Don't stress about it, we just need to be in the area where we can capture a trade at a lower time frame.  
I have added green lines which represent the key daily SnR. Rectangles have not been moved from original monthly chart.

Next.  
I have plotted black lines that I consider the strongest of SnR.  
Nothing much has changed, the SnR on Monthly, Weekly and Daily correlate pretty well.

OK, lets start looking at the SnR lines and which ones will come into play.  
I have added a red line because it has bounced off SnR four times.  
As you can see the lines have space between them, this creates a SnR zone of which is significant to your trading.

As you can see from the charts I am building a picture in my mind of where SnR is, and by doing this analysis I am increasing my chances of getting the right the lower time frame trade.

This chart is the 4hr with multiple lines plotted of all significant SnR.  
It is too crowded to trade like this so I will save it as a template because I will only use nearby SnR for lower time frame trades.

All the charts I have posted today will give you an idea / understanding of how I look at SnR.  
I will say that what you do and how you trade is completely up to the individual. I am just showing what works for me.  
  
The 4hr chart is where I start my analysis. I will look at 4hr line chart each morning and plot the nearby SnR within and just outside the average daily range.  
The average 10 day range of GU is 61 pips, so lines that are outside of this range on Monday are of no interest to me.  
Fridays close was 1,2643 therefore I would plot 4hr SnR lines approximately 70pips higher and 70 pips lower than the close price. The market may gap up or down but I would add additional line if needed.

On this chart I have added some 30m SnR lines and adjusted the 4hr SnR lines.  
I use this side by side with candlestick chart.

Hi Traders,  
On the 30m chart of GU there is key Support and Resistance at 1.2635. I would pay attention to this number over the coming days and watch how price reacts at that price.

Key SnR to monitor for entries.  
Price has been kept above 1.26354 this tells me that at this stage I should be bullish on Monday. Anything can change at open though.

Option 1.  
Look for longs off key support.  
Stick with trade bullish as long as possible to a resistance level circa +60pips

Hi Traders,  
I hope these charts have shown how I plot SnR. I have overdone the amount of examples to answer questions from private messages.  
My trading is very basic, all I do is look for bullish and bearish reactions at SnR. I monitor 4hr 30m and 15 min charts. I will sometimes use 5m and 1m charts for Gold and Nas100. I do not know if GU will do as I suggested it may shoot down but if it does I will wait for a short entry. That's all you need to do, plan and prepare.  
Tomorrow I will be looking for trades on AU, UJ, AJ and XAUUSD. I will take a look at GU later in the day.  
  
Nothing is guaranteed in trading, you just have to be in the right place at the right time.

1.2635 was also the weekly open, an important level.

\- last night US ISM weaker than Forecast data took out many tight stops  
  
\- we have another Daily spinning top candle, some interpret this as market indecision   
  
\- today intraday day trading would be the same, I check every 4hours my 4H candles for Price Action at Support/Resistance levels.   
  
\- Weekly SnR levels and Daily SnR levels has higher priority.

I took the same trade. My SL was hit.

today's data basically calculated from LAST week's data & also 2TD back. hard to explain. simple stuff once you get it. took me approx. 2 years to really get it. lol  
once you see the open and have calculated all the R/S areas using as many calculators as possible ...you'd be surprised on how easy $SPX targets are. just have to stay focused -- have CALENDAR in your own handwriting -- all the data & @ side the daily [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") [H-L] and then the WEEKLY spreads ...along with the "OPEN" sheet calculations being squared -- and see the CORRESPONDING #s / #price

![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) thanks ... but right now I found the S&P forum... not used much...but will go there from now on.  
anyhow -- this is the latest for this week on S&P 500 -- data + calc. from .272% - 1.854% ... easy to do + many more systems. took me awhile to figure out how SPX works. I ignore the news aka garbage (to me) and just concentrate on the #s / price in front of me and look @ #cycles.  
  
I know this is the forex area -- haven't played / traded forex .. yet...used once WizeTrade -- wasn't for me.

Good morning everyone,  
  
As I posted earlier, I've been backtesting the no indicator system manually using an emulator. At this point, I've gone through 18 months (2022/01-2023/06). I've been testing **only one FX pair (GBP/USD)** , my SL was often more than 10 pips, **I didn't use breakeven**(but I'm planning go through all my trades to see whether going to BE would have been more profitable), and **TP is always 7,5R**. Here are some numbers from my calculations:  
  
**The amount of trades:** 200  
**The overall gain:** 139,5 R  
**Overall gain money-wise:** from 300 EUR to 951 EUR (+217%)  
**The worst month:** -6R (2023-01)  
**The best month:** +33R (2022-02)  
**The average monthly return:** 7,75 R  
**The longest losing streak:** 9 losses in a row.  
  
For me, this is a great motivation. I'm waiting to see how it goes when trading in real-time, but I hope that I will make even more reasonable decisions and my chances won't decrease much. And to make this post more appealing, here are a few recent winning trades. Have a nice weekend!

\- it struggled a little but that normal when you look left you see previous 4H candles and SnR  
  
\- just needed some buyers to support the push higher  
  
\- breaking 2364 would be good to close this week with bonus money in the bank

**XAU Friday NFP candle**  
  
\- getting out before NFP is usually a good idea when day trading  
  
\- because it is impossible with small SL to survive the volatility

Hello Islandfx911,  
  
Thanks for sharing this way of trading.  
  
To learn the system the right way I would like to know exactly the way of drawing S/R lines from the line charts.  
While reading and exercising I got puzzled. Maybe someone can clearify..?  
  
Starting from D1 is the easiest part; I take the highs and lows but leave out the inbetween hick-ups (correct me if I'm wrong). Then, according to the description, I go to H4 and only finetune the S/Rs from the D1,... OR do I add new lines as well (probably those that I called hick-ups within the D1)????  
  
From $4 I shift to M30 and the same question occurs; do I finetune the H4 S/Rs only,.... or do I need to add new ones as they are shown within M30......???  
  
Thanks, Ben

Read the very first post again. It says adjust the lines when working your way down from D1 to H4, from H4 to 30M.  
If you will add lines on every timeframe, you will end up with too many lines. Keep it simple.

Hi Zuko, thanks for your answer.  
  
At first I thought the same.... but when counting the lines (in page 1) the master drew himself, I started doubting... ; in the first pictures (D1) I see 6 lines in the range of 0.66065 (top line is not in the H4 picture). In the second picture (H4) I see 6 lines in the range of 0.659..ish (the highest line in D1 is not included), so in this range 1 more line is drawn.  
Next shift shows a similar situation; in a smaller range there are more lines the in the higher TFs (in H4, 3 lines in the same range than in the M30, where I see 7 lines)  
  
I agree to keep it simple and one needs to be flexible, as the lines do not exactly 'line up' perfectly.  
  
you wrote: "If you will add lines on every timeframe, you will end up with too many lines.", but this is exactly what Islandfxd911 did; adding lines on every timeframe.  
Your answer 'forced' me to reread and start counting strictly the lines. Thank you for that, it helped to answer my question and I now know to start with D1 and both teak the lines in H4 and M30, while the same time add lines when outstandig levels show up in going down the ladder.  
  
Thanks!  
  
Ben

On the subject of choosing S&R lines. For people having difficulty finding them a good substitute for experience is the Williams Fractal indicator. I realize this thread is indicator-free but it may give noobs a starting point.  
  
Nice thread and good luck all.

**XAU Jul10 M30 London 7am soon**  
  
\- M30 faces several 4H SnR seen to the farther left  
  
\- breaking these would be good for move higher

using Bill Williams Fractals will not break any rules here.  
  
Fractals help to see the highs and lows much easier , but bit for the seasoned price action traders we see the fractals without the need  
  
same chart with Bill Williams Fractal

After backtesting 2 years, I started testing the system in real time this week. A couple of trades from monday and tuesday. Got out of both before reaching +7,5R because new London sessions were upcoming.  
+3,3R and +2,7R

Hello, I was looking for longs, bias was bullish today. I saw a close above 15M resistance, so I put on a trade. SL was onto 15M resistance, and TP next 1H resistance. I could let runners, but I took my TP, and exit the trade.

Hey again everyone!  
Finally, I completed a manual backtesting challenge of 2 years (2022-2023) using simulator software. I've been testing Rob's system to see if I can trade it and how profitable it can be for me. Here are the final results:  
  
**Starting amount:** 300 USD  
**Final amount:** 1348 USD  
**Increase:** 349% over 2 years (14,5% per month on avg.)  
**Profitable trades:** 63  
**Unprofitable trades:** 194  
**A few facts:** I only tested the GBP/USD pair, my TP was always 7,5R, I used wider stop losses, I didn't use break even, I always close yesterday's deals before London open, there were 3 unprofitable months and 3 with profits up to 1%. Most profitable month: +33R, worst month: -6R.  
  
Normally, I backtest one month per hour, meaning that my decisions in real-time trading could be more calculated and careful. I noticed that finding the strongest SnR zones and placing SL accordingly is key for me.**Also, this backesting helped me a lot in setting my expectations right. Even though I can have 9-10 losses in a row, it doesn't mean the strategy doesn't work.**  
  
My further plan: I am going to make some calculations on these two years to see if breakeven would have brought more profits, I will also check maybe a lower (or higher) TP would be more profitable for my style of trading.  
  
Also, as I mentioned before, I have now started trading on a demo account in real time with the goal of doubling my capital. Once I reach this goal, I think I will be ready to start trading with some of my actual money.  
  
Good luck everybody! Don't stress and stay well!

**XAU Weekly Jul 22**  
  
\- last week was a very strong pull-back into the previous week' range  
\- week 28 is a WCC and this indicates a sideways range bound market   
\- potential for a bullish breakout and that would invalidate the WCC[28] if this week closes with higher high + higher Close  
  
\- what do I trade this week ?  
> market fundamentals  
> market sentiments

Am I doing something wrong.  
  
AUD was bearish. So took a long but it hit my stoploss.  
  
And I am currently in a 14R losing streak.

I "normally" look at the Daily Candle FIRST for overall direction, for that current day. If it's red, I look for pull back sells, if it's blue, I look for pull back buys. Just gives a "general guideline" as to where price "MAY" be going, currently. Just my thoughts, that's all.

Tough day ...  
  
When trading near any higher timeframe SnR levels, I want to use the H1 and H4 price action to get into the market.  
  
Daily and Weekly SnR are where today' price action is, so better pick a H4 rejection candle.

Today's trade, +7R  
I aimed for 7,5R, but I decided to check how's it going before going to bed, and noticed that it's only 0,5R away from TP, but a risky support may be forming, so the final result is more than enough at this point.

Hey everyone, I have a question that's a bit out of context. What are you using on MT5 for automatic risk calculation? Everytime I find a good trade, I waste almost a minute while I calculate how many lots are 1% according to my SL.

I am sure Rob will reply you when he is online.  
  
Here is what I would do on a weekend.  
  
Trading XAU once a day only, risk $300 per trade, and with risk : reward 1:7.5R  
Starting with USD10,000.   
What if when your account grow to $20,000?   
Do you add another currency pair to your trading account ?  
or   
Do you increase your risk and lot size trading the same XAU?  
  
Jan 2018 to Jul 2024 Daily chart

Thanks Em,  
  
What session you trade XAU? Also, what if you have to re - enter the trade? How you enter the trade? Normally, I split into 2 entries, 1 is for rejection candle, 2nd is when I can see it goes right direction. But this strategy make me miss some good pips.

Today's +7R trade went in under an hour.  
  
I'm having trouble finding which post showed how to react to H4 candles, could someone help me? From my understanding, I should see how the last H4 candle (that's already closed) reacted to a resistance/support level. For example, if it closed below the resistance, I am only looking for sells, right? And the resistance zone becomes support only when a H4 candle closes above it, correct?  
  
Thanks in advance.

Today, I took that beautiful trade on gold. I saw, that we broke the structure on 15m time frame, and that was annoucment for me to pull in sell. The structure was broken with clean bearish candles, so I gave that trade big probability to play in my advantage. RR was 1:1, but I saw that we hit 1H support, so I coonsidered to take my profit. Sl was above the strucutre as always while I trade that set up.

hi @bigjjnem  
  
My trading hours are Sydney-Tokyo open and Frankfurt-London open   
  
When trading the Daily chart, I only need to take one trade entry per day and with set-and-forget entry, stop loss and take profit,   
and I do not need to monitor my trades.   
When we set the SL to -1R and TP to +7.5R, we will have many losses and the win rate is not great.  
But you will be profitable over the long term.   
The Money Management based strategy here is to grow an account starting at USD10,000 and grow that to USD50,000 over say 1,000 trades.  
For every USD10,000 growth in an account you add another currency pair.

If you don't monitor the trade, then your TP should be the nearest H4 SnR, shouldn't it? Or you set your tp based on your own R:R number ?

Another nice trade today. +7R. So far my capital doubling challenge is going well. A month have passed since the start, and I'm up 18%. I completed 18 trades, 6 of them were profitable.

> Hey everyone, I have a question that's a bit out of context. What are you using on MT5 for automatic risk calculation? Everytime I find a good trade, I waste almost a minute while I calculate how many lots are 1% according to my SL. Maybe there's a tool or something that could calculate my lots automatically depending on how big of SL I choose?

Hi Evaldas,

Hi L,  
Hope you are doing good.  
I have one question regarding this chart. Your entry does not seem to make any 1-2-3 pattern however Rob keeps mentioning that we have to find 1-2-3 pattern everyday only.

When trading once-per-day on the Daily chart, I do not concern myself with the 4Hr SnR levels. Pay more attention to Daily chart price action and the Weekly levels.

Thanks for the input Em. You are right. D1 Snr tends to have more RR and h4 Snr.  
  
Also, I've found that I always win and win with high R:R if my entry has rejection m30 candle total length is more than 2 horizontal line in tradingview.   
With a short rejection candle, My win rate is like 50:50, and I've never had a good RR win with these short one. Example below:

Just curious, why would you ask about another strategy, when your commenting in a thread here, that already has a strategy?.

RSI is a momentum indicator and you can use that to pick the best setup candles which has price momentum.  
  
You can develop your own system using Price Action and use the RSI as your helping indicator if that gives you more confidence to take a trade.  
  
However, if you learn to read your candles, you will develop the confidence to trade without the RSI just like my XAU trades I post here this week.  
  
XAU M30 example,  
the setup candle has momentum

Hi Ive just finished reading this whole thread, thanks Rob and to everyone who has contributed to this wonderful system.  
I was reluctant to post this trade but I think its good to show how stupidity and not following the rules can get you into trouble. I think I followed the rules right up to when I decided to pull the trigger. Totally against the main trend, I went back to my old ways. Please someone tell me that I'm an idiot, I need to hear it.  
If its not clear I went long on AUDUSD.. I live in Australia I took the trade during the recommended time. BTW it was also major news today.  
Double stupidity.  
  
Thanks

NEVER, EVER trade against the larger time frames, trade with them, not against them. It's like stepping in front of a speeding freight train expecting it to immediately stop, it's not going to happen. We've ALL done it, just don't do it again, lesson learned.

I had to bail out before red news for +2R, even though it may have been a +7 deal. I always close all trades 30 minutes before red news, otherwise it becomes more like a coin-flipping game rather than a systematic approach. By the way, the entry was activated by a pending order.

Hi Evaldas, would you mind explaining your entry please.. I see that price did not reach any levels of resitance/support, its far away from your H4 level.  
Is there a 15min level that you traded from? i.e. 0.85305  
  
Thanks in advance.

Hi. The entry wasn't perfectly by the OP's rule, but he also mentioned that SnR zones don't always line up perfectly. The price bounced off the H4 SnR and then the pullback was building up before market open, making a nice 1-2-3 pattern in M15/M30 chart (blue line is the resistance I was aiming for). As you can see, I could have waited a bit more and made a much better entry, but I rather enter earlier and put a wider SL to avoid missing out. But I would highly suggest thoroughly testing the OP's system because these are the adjustments that I made during months of backtesting to fit my style.

my 2 cents.  
although this is hind sight for yesterday, it needs to be stressed that higher time frames give the whole context to the direction of trades.  
shorting in all my trades.

Entered an EUR/USD trade at the beginning of London open, used a wider stop loss because I wasn't sure where the rejection will be. The price was half a pip from my SL. We'll see how it goes from now on. Aiming for +7R  
  
Update: SL hit.

Closed the trade for +3,2R because high-impact news are coming.  
  
Also, I decided to stop posting because I feel an emotional pressure to win so I could post my results here. I want to be detached emotionally from FX as much as possible to avoid hype and disappointment. See you all some time later. Wish you luck everyone, I'll keep checking out this thread!

Hi, I really like your system as it is really simple and it has a clean chart, breathe of a fresh air. I mean this in no disrespect but if u dont mind, may i ask how is your strategy worked out for you so far? How much % have u made each month?, thank you for your time.

Hi Guys  
  
Would welcome your thoughts on my understanding of some charts for Asian open about 11am AEST 12/08/24.

AUDUSD - So we have an uptrend bias. Where I have placed the arrow we have a rejection candle on support @0.65682 which follows from an impulse move 4 candles earlier (1hour). So we trade next candle after arrow.

EURUSD - So we have a downtrend bias. At 1.66 (blue line) we have support. There is an impulse move down but the up candle below my first down arrow has no rejection wick. So no trade at the moment. There is then an impulse move through the next level of support @1.6573. The second arrow shows our entry point once we confirm bull candle with rejection wick.

AUDCAD - Up bias. At first arrow @0.90198 support (0930 AEST) we have a decent entry but it is pre-market so not sure if valid entry for this system. We get another possible setup at second arrow which is correct time market open but no clear rejection of support @0.90198 so no trade.

> Hi Guys Would welcome your thoughts on my understanding of some charts for Asian open about 11am AEST 12/08/24. {image} AUDUSD - So we have an uptrend bias. Where I have placed the arrow we have a rejection candle on support @0.65682 which follows from an impulse move 4 candles earlier (1hour). So we trade next candle after arrow. {image} EURUSD - So we have a downtrend bias. At 1.66 (blue line) we have support. There is an impulse move down but the up candle below my first down arrow has no rejection wick. So no trade at the moment. There is then...

Hi Shertiger,  
This is the trade you needed to be on today. Use your line chart for peak / trough clarification.

Missed a setup a couple of days ago when I was away from the computer. So far today (oz time) haven't seen setups on AUDUSD, GBPAUD, USDCHF, EURUSD, EURGBP and EURJPY. Will check at London open.

My understanding is that you dont draw S/R lines on the timeframe that your executing your trade?  
i.e. you trade at the zones drawn from the higher time frame.  
Do you also add other S/R lines that you see on lower time frames i.e. from daily to 4hr you see other S/R lines on 4hr which aren't too clear on the daily?  
  
Thanks

Hi all,  
  
Would be nice if anyone can spot the differences between 2 set up.   
  
And are these set up smart? I mean if you look at it, it is uptrend. These shorts are against the trend. We don't really care about low timeframe trend, do we?

those who do not have the time can place limit orders.  
those who have the time can monitor multi time frames price action to refine trade entry.

Hi all,  
  
I've recently stumbled upon this thread as I'm trying to get back into Forex after a long time. I like the cleanliness of this system as it suits my personality. I want to thank Island and everyone who has contributed to the thread. It has opened up my eyes. The charts I like to work with are weekly, monthly, three month and six months charts as I find them easier to read and the S/R are not as cluttered. The problem with those charts is that you have to be patient, deal with drawdowns while watching your unrealized profits, sometime 100's of pips, go down the drain waiting for your TP to hit.  
  
I have been dabbling with this method using really small position sizes to test it out. I think I finally have the trading times nailed down so my first few trades petered out because I was trading the wrong sessions; thus, more losses than wins. I want to present GBPAUD. According to the higher time frames the bias is up so I am looking to buy. Mind you I didn't take this trade because of my time zone. I know we are supposed to draw a rectangle to indicate our desired trading zone; however, for this example, where do you draw it? Also looking at the line chart, it bounces off of a trough instead of a peak. Where is the 1,2,3?  
  
Again, I'm here to learn because I want to be a successful trader and my questions are made because I'm curious and not to critique. Thank you!

there was not HTF support/resistance at that price level ...  
  
look at H1 and H4 SnR levels when you see M30 line chart swing high and swing low.

> Hi all, Would be nice if anyone can spot the differences between 2 set up. And are these set up smart? I mean if you look at it, it is uptrend. These shorts are against the trend. We don't really care about low timeframe trend, do we? {image} {image}

a lot happens in the LTF and he different volatility and different depth of the retracements in trending market type conditions,  
  
therefore better to trade following the trend if you want those +7.5R trades  
  
counter-trend can get you +3R at best if you pick the rejection setups  
  
its all news/events driven when day-trading,

Thank you for the breakdown. It is very much appreciated. In this instance to profit on this trade, your stop loss would need to be a bit wider than normal or again you enter a second time. I understand that the system calls for you to place your SL at the end of the wick, but when you're so close to support wouldn't it be better to place the SL below it as in your 1 hour chart?

i focus here on trade entry.  
do not want to say much about SL and TP because each trader will have their own technique according to their own personal trading experience and preference.  
the differences can vary a lot. it is a zone. so just leave it as it is.  
here there are 3 traders using different techniques for SL.  
so who is to say which one is correct?  
oh C does not mean me.

Hey @[emmanuel7788](https://www.forexfactory.com/emmanuel7788), it seems like you´re pretty good at trading this strategy. I´m currently reading through the entire thread. I hope it´s okay if I ask you a few questions... How long have you been trading this strategy? What´s your hit rate?

Hello everyone! Just started to test the strategy. Here is a beautiful setup on GJ M15. 3.8 RR. Any feedback is very welcome!  
  
PS: Does anybody know how Rob is feeling? I´ve read he had some serious health issues... Hope he is fine!

GJ M15 short. 2.8RR. Not sure if this one is valid but we got some strong resistance there (also on H1). I´m also expecting a pullback towards last high. Would move my SL @BE as soon as 1R has been reached and secure some profits at 2R. Any thoughts?  
  
**Update:** SL hit at BE

Took this short trade on GU M15. 4RR  
Not a typical break & retest trade but rather a rejection trade from H1 resistance level. M15 already showed some strong rejection.

**Update:** GU M15 TP. Half closed at 2RR, the other half at 4RR. Total +3RR.  
  
Incredible how accurate it works. I´ve been trading for about 7 years with a similar approach but always waited for more confirmation (multiple wicks + momentum shift). But this approach just blows my mind. so simple but so much more effective!  
Rob, if you see this post, THANK YOU! I would never come to the idea that a bullish/bearish candle with a wick into res/sup would be enough as confirmation. No wonder that you often reach 7.5RR or more. Need to work on my trade management...

Another trade on GU... M30 long. Rejection at M30 & H4 support level. I don´t think a would have balls to take this one on a live account but let´s see.

**Update:** GU has been stopped out at BE. total +1R  
  
Thought about going short at DT on M15 but there is not much space to the downside.  
  
I´ll probably call it a day with total +4R.

EU M30. We got a nice rejection candle right at the swing low & H4 demand zone. Not too much space for the bulls, so I decided to place a buy limit order as shown below.  
  
**Update:** limit order triggered

One last trade... EJ M15 short. 4RR. A bit risky I think but so much resistance there also on higher timeframes. Not expecting a trend change just a bit correction seems likely...   
This is the beauty of this strategy. with such an early entry and small SL, there is almost every time a chance to take partials or move SL to BE. Incredible!

Ok, this is the last one for sure... XAUUSD M15 short. 3.4RR  
We got a strong bearish impulse from H4 res. lvl, then back to the previous swing low on M15 and a nice rejection bar.  
  
**Update:** that was quickly... tp hit +2.7R  
  
**Todays result:**  
GU M15 short +3R  
GU M30 long +1R  
EU M30 long -1R  
EJ M15 short +3R  
XU M15 short +2.7R  
TOTAL: +8.7R

You are correct. Note that the 1sma shows the closing price . Consider that you might need a way to also see the high and low of that closing price.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f438.png?v=15.1)

Waited all day and fell asleep ... I usually stay awake when the 4Hr candle closes and look for the completion and then look for that setup ...  
  
This perfect hindsight sell trade +5R

GU-Today strong S&R zone.  
When LD or NY session open, I'll check 1-2-3 pattern, S&R lv and rejection candle.  
BOOM  
Whether it is win or lose, this is the system.

GU M15 short again.   
\- double top at H4 & Daily S&R level  
\- strong bearish impulse + pullback to the previous swing low + strong rejection candle  
\- I decided to enter the trade per sell limit order to keep SL tight.   
\- 4.7RR

Hello traders. First friday in the month is NFP day, so no trading for me. Want to take time to analyze some trades and backtest a bit.  
I thought it´s not a bad idea to show a few examples of the importance of higher timeframes and trades which are better not to trade. Here is an example of a trade I personally wouldn´t take. GBP/USD breakdown:  
  
1.The first chart shows GU M15: It seems like we got a bullish breakout of the range + Pullback to the previous swing high + rejection candle. Seems tradable no? Let´s take a look at the higher timeframes.  
  
2\. H1 chart seems very bullish too (strong bullisch breakout candle out of the range)  
  
3\. H4 chart shows perfectly why it´s not the best idea to buy in this area (strong resistance zone just above/at the potential entry point). Do you really want to trade into this zone?  
  
4\. Daily chart speaks for itself. Previous swing low as resistance level.

Probably not the best idea to trade UC if NY is closed

EURJPY M15 short - 7.2RR. I was not sure about this one because of the strong bullish momentum. But reasons are clear: double top right at the H4/H1 S&R + wick. First target already hit. Partial closed, SL at BE. Let´s see

Hi Pablo looks like your nailing it...well done. A question if i may....your charts look like you trade the higher time frame S/R zones on lower timeframes. Do you not take much notice on your execution time frame S/R zones? This is where I'm struggling.  
Thanks

Hi Crows, thanks. It´s just my second week trading this strategy, so I´m surely not a pro, even if the results are impressive.   
My plan ist pretty simple. Most recent H4 S&R as key levels to watch for (on line chart). Sometimes I adjust them on H1 timeframe. As soon as one of the key levels is reached, I switch to M15 or M30 timeframe and wait for a reversal pattern, f.e. double top/bottom or market structure shift with momentum + pullback. I don´t trade just a single rejection candle of the H4 key level. Tomorrow I´m going to show a few examples. But like I said, it´s just my second week trading the strategy on demo. If it goes well, I want to try a prop firm challenge trading this strategy.

GJ M15 short trade I took before just hit TP. Let me use this one as example. Explanations are on the charts.  
1\. H4 line chart  
2\. H4 candlestick chart  
3\. M15   
Hope it helps

Here´s an example of a trade I would NOT take. Actually we got some strong bearish momentum. Previous swing low has been broken too. What I miss is a H4 candle breaking this level. For me it´s still support NOT resistance. As soon as H4 candle closes below, it becomes resistance

No, I was looking into H4. There was a pretty strong resistance that was enough for me to enter. However, things happen, not a big deal ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1) If there's a H4 Snr that's only have been crossed by impulsive candles, I consider that SnR relatively strong.

Just like Rob taught us. However, it was only +3R because I remembered the upcoming news minutes before it happened.

Rob's Rejection Candle and Dead Zone are very sample and effective for me since I used his.

EURUSD H1  
You can see I entered prematurely at candle close after rejection looking candle blue highlight area (red arrow). The correct rejection candle in the correct area showed up about 2-3 candles later, my SL could ave been about 11 pips and I would've have had almost 3R by now.  
  
Impulse went thru 2 support zones - one being an H4 zone but price went all the way back up to the H1 zone.

**UK100 Sep27 update and review:**  
  
\- that 4Hr pull-back did not produce a 'rejection candle' for a possible sell trade  
  
\- the next 4 hours was the trap to lure traders , I am very cautious when trading the New York 9:30am and 10:30am period  
  
\- by the time after the 2nd pullback ... it was my bedtime, very tired and ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f634.png?v=15.1)

I attached the picture below and would very appreciate if can got some advise/enlightenment from you guys ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f64f.png?v=15.1)

Hi Island,  
May I ask, is there anything you look at to help in deciding which direction to take or should one plot for the possibility of both ways like Neocruz in post 2185? Many thanks

That will be true sometime or may be not. Op trading system very relying to tradable zone and need to avoid dead zone.  
I think M5 is also good entry for sometimes when M15 and M30 rejection candle isn't appeared.

Thank you Neocruz, I have little experience using the 5m with NIS. I feel also it is better to be within market open

Mblack this is stunning, please may I ask what lead you to prepare to look to sell? If I plot a TL on the 1H there is a break just before the signal?

In my opinion, this two entries must be AAA Grade.  
Both ended with BE. So be it, this is the System and let's face it.

**UK100 Oct03 Daily**  
  
\- looks obvious where it will be heading   
  
\- the challenge would be getting an entry with small SL and R:R 1:5

Hello everyone, I would like to share my observation of trading on GU today. I tried to find the entry to m15, but it was much clearer to enter m5. I just started following this thread, so comments are welcome. Thank you all for your contributions.

Hi Traders,  
Just a quick note.  
When you are looking for trades, you must always be aware of the daily range. If the market has moved a big % of the daily range it is unlikely that you will get a trade in the same direction that will reach a 7.5R target. You are better off getting a reversal setup at the market open and trading back into the daily move.  
  
  
Hope this makes sense, it will save you some $ by following this simple rule. 

Your trade order needs to be in the right place at the right time.

What do you use for ADR?  
\- 5 days ADR  
\- 10 days ADR  
\- 30 days ADR  
  
  
I have been using a conservative 100-days ADR for all my trading.

AU NY session. One more try today. Should run great if there's enough momentum to crash through the 0.67303. Aiming for +5, moved SL to BE.  
Update: well, it didn't crash through the 0.67303, so it's BE.

London session, USD/JPY. Seems like a great opportunity, but there's an obstacle to beat at 148.56 in order to reach the upper level. However, the trade is already at BE at this point.  
  
Update: +5 tp hit

Not a good entry, S/L hit. Should have been aware of previous 4HR swing high, right at the top of those 15M candles. Oh well, lesson learned. On to the next one. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f4aa.png?v=15.1)

Hello all! I am not new to Forex, but I am new to posting here. I wanted to share my naked chart and talk with others on how I manage successful trades over the years. I've added 2 snap shots of my charts. I will give a clue on my daily targets. They are the 5 ADR for target 1 and then I take 10% off that to get my target 2. I'd love to get some feedback. Thanks all as I appreciate the way we trade.

I never take a trade if it doesn't meet certain a criteria. The biggest is a 3 for 1 profit. I'm willing to risk 1 for the gain of 3. A loss is inevitable so by following rules you set will help in the long run. I also only trade off a 15min chart, anything below that is just noise. Also, when price goes past my entry I lock it in and your right, scaling out is important as well. I'm willing to be an open book and if anyone is interested in setting up their charts like mine, please just ask.

GJ - London session  
Looks like a reversal  
  
SL hit  
  
But it's a good zone. So, I placed another trade.  
  
Hit my SL again. But I reentered the trade again. This is the last trade that I will be taking today.  
  
That's it for today I'm out.

EU. Closed the trade at 3R, because of extended candle, I thought, it will reverse, but it continued and it would hit my target 6.5R.

Hello everyone. I am writing on FF for the first time, so do not judge strictly.  
Yesterday there was an interesting deal on gold. Purchase after the news, on the refusal candle, entry at 2559.8, stop 2557.3. Exit on the retest 2575. Profit 6R

Yesterday selling the EURUSD pair.

We sell 1.0551, stop 1.0558.  
Here the target 7.5R is fulfilled.

Hello traders.  
The study of Rob's system is coming to an end as the unread pages in this thread decrease.  
I am grateful to you for sharing such a wonderful system.  
Thanks ITB, for your levels and active help, today I made, apparently by accident, support h4 and the pound landed neatly on it!  
Trade on the GBPUSD pair

Looking through the trade in the Australian session, I noticed the AUDUSD pair. The sell signal was formed after an unsuccessful test of the h4 resistance, and the price fell to support on h4.

Yes, i moved from roadmap to no indicators and to 15m and higher tf and i like it a lot. While with Roadmap, I was waiting for the signal, I often noticed reversals from support and resistance.

The M15 has always been my favorite but I stray away from it because of the perceived risk, especially on the NQ given the extent of some M15 candles. That is, of course, my problem, and not a problem with the M15. So I chase M1, M2, M5, renko and range charts. But your post reminds me that there really is something special about the M15 series. 

My objective is to learn the skill of flawless execution of my trading plan

In today's session, I analyzed the NZD/USD currency pair. The price reached a key support area, which had proven reliable in the past. I noticed liquidity accumulation in this zone, indicated by brief price spikes and quick reversals. This suggested that larger market orders were being absorbed, hinting at a potential reversal.  
  
This observation was my signal to enter a long trade. The support level provided a solid base with a favorable risk-reward setup, allowing me to place a stop-loss just below it. The reduced selling pressure further confirmed the likelihood of an upward correction, presenting a promising trading opportunity.  
  
I'm new to this thread and like to contribute to this thread. I’m excited to share my knowledge and experiences, while also learning from all of you and gaining new insights. Engaging with you all is a great opportunity to grow together and deepen our understanding. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
I took my profits on the first resistance level, as I saw rejection building up on that level.

Selling FTSE. 15-min and 1-min charts.  
  
pS Asked to explain what the minute charts are for. In fact, the 15-minute chart carries all the information, there is a large failure candle and selling 8135, with a stop at 8147, a good profit was obtained. Everything is according to the rules of the system. But the time is very liquid, and switching to the 1st or 3rd timeframe allows you to make a more flexible entry.

These charts don't "look" like the system he has shared on this thread?. If you're going to post something not related to this thread, what's the point of posting here?.

After the UK news, the GBPUSD pair rose to 1.2714. The pair last traded above 1.27 on November 14th. I sell 1.2707, stop 1.2715.

XAUUSD. At 8-00 a growing candle appeared. This is She, I thought. Like in the movie Matrix about Neo.  
I took the next small dead candle for a candle of refusal, but I honestly admit that I set the stop at the minimum -2618.5

I was asked why I was breaking the rules of the system and what are the minute charts doing here?  
Let me explain. Firstly, I am overwhelmed with delight about getting to know Rob's system.  
I also like trading indices, but in liquid times the best timeframes are 1 and 3 minutes. Everything is too fast.  
By the way, I also trade in illiquid times, the speeds are low there, and the 15-minute chart is just right, but then I will get a remark that I am not trading according to the system, since now the time is not right  
somehow.  
I just made a trade on FTSE according to all the rules, except for the trading time, I am attaching the chart, but I will try not to do this again![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f92d.png?v=15.1)  
I also want to add, a huge thank you to the Rob, and wish him good luck.  
Buy 8090, st 8085, TP 8120

Today I was waiting for the USDJPY pair to fall. More precisely, I was waiting for a signal. I didn't wait, I accidentally looked at a pair of AUDJPY, and there is good resistance and as many as two signals. And all with a happy ending - they have fallen by 70 pips so far, this is at least 10 R. But I didn't go in, I don't break the rules anymore.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f9d0.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f92d.png?v=15.1)

Hi Traders,  
Took this trade today just for some beer money.  
You don't have to be perfect with trade selection, you just have to know how the market works. There will always be a retrace / rejection candle to get into a trade.  
What I have shown in this thread is don't follow the 2R heard, you have to be unique, unique in your own way. Be different to the masses and notch out your winning trading system.

Hi ITM,  
Decided against it. I have a friend that went in for the same surgery about six weeks ago and it did not work, he is worse than before he went in to hospital.  
I am tweaking medication for as long as I can then...... Well we'll cross that bridge when we get there.  
I have nearly been cleaned up five times by Fremantle drivers this week while riding my bike so I might not need any future medication tweaking if they keep driving as bad as they do.  
On a positive note I became a Grandparent for the first time a few days ago to a healthy 11 lb boy. We are very happy to say the least.  
  
Trade well  
Regards  
Rob

You are right, I was too eager to enter the trade, I entered early. I'm still working on patience and analysis. But I'm happy, I was right with direction.

congrats. your grandson will definitely gives you bundles of joy and lots of exercise chasing around too.  
yes some surgery may be too harsh.  
from my little knowledge, please be mindful of what you eat (especially too much carbohydrate and sugar is no good), have enough good sleep and rest.  
also human is made to move around, so take the morning or evening walk.  
best regards

How ironic, you use "[Pepperstone](/brokers/pepperstone "View Pepperstone Broker Profile")." I was just looking at opening an account with them. Do you like them, overall?.

i have not use them.  
i was thinking either [IC Markets](/brokers/ic-markets "View IC Markets Broker Profile") or Pepperstone.in the future. both equally good.  
I like IC Markets small spread for gold.

Thanks to ITB. Today I spent 2 hours drawing h4 based on your examples. So far, one pair each. The search for signals has become much easier. In just a week, I counted at least 4 transactions with +7R only on the GBPUSD pair. And the quality of the deals is excellent. h4 in conjunction with m15 are very productive. Sometimes you can also use m5

there is no right or wrong because every time frames have their own story to tell.  
d1 is a doji indecision.  
at the current market price, the latest reaction was rejecting from from mn resistant and then d1 resistant.  
the d1 bounced up from the support but could not close above the resistant.  
h4 is ranging. m30 is converging.  
it is coiling for big movement.  
best not to predict but to monitor closely the price reaction of lower time frames to the support and resistant.

please carry on the testing and hard work for at least 6 months. one reaps what he sows.  
we take the supporting factors and reasons from the higher time frames h4 and above.  
h4 is the lowest of the higher time frames.  
at the close of every day take into account of the daily support and resistant.  
at the close of every week take into account of the weekly support and resistant.  
at the close of every month take into account of the monthly support and resistant.

> Hi Traders, Took this trade today just for some beer money. You don't have to be perfect with trade selection, you just have to know how the market works. There will always be a retrace / rejection candle to get into a trade. What I have shown in this thread is don't follow the 2R heard, you have to be unique, unique in your own way. Be different to the masses and notch out your winning trading system. {image} Have a good one. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f37a.png?v=15.1) o'clock now

Hi Rob,  
I hope you are well. Please may I ask you, was this trade during Frankfurt? And how did you go about placing a few trades in one? Do you split your risk into 3 and do you still place your SL above the rejection candles? Thank you so much

Hi M,  
I am going okay with health. Thanks.  
In regards to the trade, I looked at previous days bearish price action and wanted to get in short and In regards to time of trades, I entered trade as soon as I saw market activity start.  
I have eased back on trade size and extended SL size due to volatility. The SL was 10 pips and I used pivots to exit with a satisfactory RR.  
If I see support / resistance inside the 7.5TP I will use it.  
In regards to multiple lots, I have split my 1R risk into (3.3R x 3) This is not an abnormal thing to do. You will find many traders do this. It is mainly because I want to take things slower and I am not concerned about large profits anymore.  
I am just placing trades if I am at the computer and something jumps out at me. The first two trades we planned and the third I placed because it was set to go down and I wanted to take advantage of the market volatility. You have to remember I have been trading for over 35 years and can sometimes see things that others don't.  
I hope this answers your question.  
  
Just to add. I would highly recommend everyone watch the above video the ITB has posted. It is an excellent video that should be watched multiple times.  
Kind Regards  
Rob 

Your trade order needs to be in the right place at the right time.

Weekly resistance w stopped the pair's growth.  
The trading system I use suggested selling just below 1.26.  
The deal went through, but I was wondering how Rob's system could be used.  
It worked, but on the chart 5m.

Hi Graf,  
You can trade any timeframe with this system. Trade what you are comfortable with, just make sure you are 100% confident with the setup.  
Regards  
Rob

XAUUSD pair.  
gold fell into the strong support zone.  
First I put sl at 2610.5 and buy at 2613.5. target - morning maximum 2632. Then I adjusted sl to 2609.5 and buy 2612.5 and ...  
the train left without me.  
On the one hand, I was trying to catch a falling knife, on the other hand, a deal of at least 6R could have gone through.  
And what would have been the correct entry in this deal?

Hi Cab,  
Overall trend is down. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
Pullback to prior resistance. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
Rejection Candle. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
Timing. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
I would have use 30m entry as per chart. There were two opportunities on that day for easy profits.

the 2 min looks good after the fact. most time it will be difficult to handle the whipsaw.  
so stick with m30 or m15. m5 is the lowest to go down to.

Ok, I get it. I'm learning, so we should always trade the opening, right? According to the pair.

I believe this was a valid trade on EURUSD. In line with the H4, and at the right time.  
  
BE was hit.

EURUSD M30  
  
USA Open  
  
Time of Trade 1 17  
Time of Trade 2 17.30  
  
Second one H4 aligns with M30, so i think that's the focus.

Just seeing if you are paying attention.  
Not saying it will work out

GA has some work to do, a bit of support. It may not workout but I liked the setup.  
Impulse move down and retrace back up prior to market open.  
If it does not start moving down soon I'd say it will be a flop.  
There has to be significant activity to move a market  
I'm in the money so not fazed what it does  
  
Out of GA with small profit  
Watching GU for any activity

Hi M,  
You have you chart marked up well with support and resistance visible. Well done.

Good day to all participants! I found this topic completely by accident two or three days ago... I read a lot, tried to understand how the system works without indicators. Numerous "gurus" only filled my brain with incomprehensible, unnecessary, completely useless, sometimes even harmful for trading information. And finally I came across this topic, like a breath of fresh air! One day was spent on quickly reading the basics - 10-15 pages, tried to make a markup. It seems to have worked... Today I looked through the entire topic from beginning to end, trying to consolidate the knowledge gained and at the same time trying to trade (there is nothing better than practice). It worked again... I make markups on cryptocurrencies, as it turned out, the fundamental principles work quite well here too. I will continue to study and practice this fairly simple system. To the topic starter: I am glad that you had a grandson. I hope that this positive moment will give new strength to fight the disease. Health to you! I apologize for the English language, it is not my native language, I use Google translator.

Yesterday an interesting technical picture appeared on h1. The deviation candle, similar to a pinbar, was a buy signal  
  
Early this morning gold reached 2700, and then tested support at 2675. On the subsequent growth and rollback on the m15 chart a rejection candle was formed.  
Buy 2689

Hi Traders,  
From now until Christmas break I am going to attempt to post my daily trade. I say trade but it might be trades or no trades depending on market conditions.  
I might not be able to post tomorrow as off to Chiropractor and visiting Grandson.  
From PM's and emails, I know some of you have had great success with my system and others have struggled.  
If you use what I have shown here in this thread and combine it with the very informative and successful thread started by Inthebox you will be on track to becoming successful, **IF** you can absorb the information and adapt. If you go over Inthebox thread images you will notice there is repetition in the charts posted. That is because the system set ups consistently replicate day after day. It is how you respond and react to the information. You need to shift your attention away from the noise and focus on yourself.  
  
So where does success come from?  
1\. It is not the system  
2\. It is not an indicator  
3\. It is the **individual**  
  
Recently I have had some great trades and also some I have been stopped out to the pip only for the market to then go in my favor. Did I beat myself up, blame algos or brokers over getting stopped out? No, I got back in the trade because I believed in my system. The trade worked out and I made some coin. This is what you need to do. There are no secrets in trading that other traders keep from you that is causing you to fail, it is you causing you fail. As soon as you admit this to yourself the sooner you can move forward. I am no genius, I am just a person like you. I don't have any special abilities that makes me better trader than you.  
What makes a successful trader is the ability to adapt to market conditions. This can be difficult for the novice due to insufficient screen time but it is possible to fast track this.  
  
My belief's  
1\. My system works  
2\. I only need one successful trade a week to increase my funds.  
3\. I am not placing trades that do not fit the entry / exit rules.  
4\. I am allowed to make mistakes.  
  
Making mistakes.  
We all make them including me, it is the trait of the human race. It is okay to make mistakes but just don't keep making them. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f644.png?v=15.1)  
  
There are many great traders here on FF that you may relate to more than me or my system. Go there if you feel that it suits you better, but make sure you stick with their system rules and work on you.  
I make no promises on your success, ultimately you are in control of you, not me.  
I will supply you my charts and notes, it is up to you to ask questions and hopefully we can get you on the right track.  
  
Another tip I will give you. It is important to take time away from the charts, the longer you sit there the more you are likely to make mistakes so, go find somewhere quiet in your house / garden and sit and switch off for 30 minutes each day. You will find questions you have will be answered when you are away from charts not when you are staring on them.  
  
Remember, every moment in time is unique, you have no control of market direction, your results, or anything else. You can plan for outcomes but don't expect them to be as you have calculated. I planned to grow old with the love of my life, I did not plan for illness and an early grave.  
You never know the cards you will get dealt, you just have to play the best game you can with them. That is what I do and will do until I cannot anymore.  
Stay positive and live in the moment.  
Talk soon ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60e.png?v=15.1)

Hi Traders,  
I will only be posting charts in 15m timeframe.  
Charts will be line and candlestick.  
If you have read the thread you will know that the line chart tells me all I need to know.  
I will post two types of trade setups.  
I may use an indicator 'SuperTrend' to help you see the trade direction. This will be temporary as you need to see the trade without indicators  
I favor the morning session Asian / Sydney hours.  
Lets stick to questions that are constructive.  
Some of you will see trades that I don't, speak up and discuss them as I am only human and can miss or make mistakes.  
I will not be posting indicators or templates.

Hi Traders.  
This is the chart I use to take trades from. You may find it difficult to make a trading decision based solely on the line chart but you will soon.  
I will go through the process I go through each morning before the market opens.  
  
1\. Open up 15m line chart  
2\. Draw rectangles at prior support / resistance swings  
Tip: Look for line charts that have good swings  
Note: Don't trade flat swings.  
  
I'll add rectangle and notes on next chart.

Hi Traders,  
Chart two I have plotted a rectangle. The reason I have placed the rectangle there is.  
1\. There are two points of resistance prior to market open.

Hi Traders,  
The next chart, I have added the open line for start of trade for 12 12 2024.  
You will note that the market started trading towards the resistance rectangle after market open. At this point I have no idea if the market will react at the resistance or trade straight through it. As I mentioned earlier, you / me have no control of direction. I have no idea what the market will do, I just have to be prepared for an entry setup if it occurs.  
If the rectangle is breached it is likely to become short term support. But no one knows that, it is just something that may happen. Who Knows ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)  
We must trade in the moment.

Hi Traders,  
So, we started with two resistance tests and a rectangle.  
1\. I extend the rectangle prior to market open and I wait for a bullish rejection candle.  
  
Note: A bullish rejection candle is when price has been pushed up and a sharp pull back occurs at resistance.  
  
Again price may blast up through the high of the candle and it may become invalidated. No one knows.  
Note: I do not give up on a short trade entry if the rejection candle high is breached. I will still monitor for another rejection candle.

Hi Traders,  
When you go to candle chart you will clearly see a bullish rejection candle  
That is your entry candle.  
Sell on close and place SL above high.  
Set TP at 7.5R or nearest support to 7.5R  
You don't have to be exact, just get in.

This is the first of two setups I trade. I will discuss the other tomorrow if time.

Hi Traders,  
I have been out most of the day and am just going over charts.  
AJ was a successful trade. It did not reach 7.5R however 4R was available to be locked in at the R61 Pivot.  
Entry long was at 97.72, SL at 97.63 (-9) 1R, TP at 98.15 (+43)  
This setup is the 2nd type I use.  
I will go through it in detail today / tomorrow.  
Hopefully we will get some live trades going.

Hi Traders,  
I am currently watching EU. News is due in a few minutes so I'll see how it reacts.  
keep you posted.

Hi Traders,  
I am currently short EN. I do not trade the UK open very often but thought I would post the details of trade to maybe get some questions going.  
This is a pullback trade.  
Definition of pullback trade.  
1\. Market has moved with trend and made a solid move before the market open.  
2\. Market pulls back counter trend at the open to support or resistance in this case.  
  
Will it work out? Who Knows ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)  
It is only a 3.3R trade with TP set at DS38 Pivot.

Good to be back, happy to see that the thread is still active with many posts  
  
Took a short trade on EU M15, the first rejection candle was a pin bar, hence no go but a second rejection candle came two candles later. The area of rejection also coincided with last Friday's high, I turned on a session indicator to make the confluence clearer. Currently sitting at about +2R at the time of writing, I moved my SL to BE but included the initial SL during entry for reference.  
  
I'll try to post as much as I can  
  
  
Update @ NY Session:  
EU short Exited 70% of position at 4.5R, remaining 30% SL set to +2R. Price seems range-bound between the two zones, not comfortable to leave the trade overnight only for it to hit my SL.  
Added XAUUSD short during NY session. Exited 30% @ 3.5R, remaining 70% hit TP of 7.5R. The rationale for 30% @ 3.5R is to have the position risk-free without needing to shift SL to BE as gold is a very volatile pair, I found it often hitting BEs when I shift my SLs.

Hi Lolxhaha,  
Good to hear from you again.  
Pin bars don't offer the best RR. It is wise to wait until the trade is heavily in your favor  
I was watching EU for a short. You did well to be prepared and take advantage.  
The market is slow most Mondays but anything can happen.  
I will be trading tomorrow if I get a signal.

Hi Rob  
I'm new to your thread, and I'm very interested in what you have to say and show.  
I just started to go through the thread, I'm at page 7, then thought let me look what's going on today. So i found your latest post.  
Will continue to work through your thread, and start some backtesting to see how I get along with your method.  
Thank you for what you're giving us.

Hi Rob  
  
When you looking for trades, do you checking daily and 4hr TF for overall direction, and main support and resistance zones from these tf?  
Thanks

You can plot your main SR lines from 4 hrs, these tend to be areas that your 7.5R TP **may** stretch into, if it is congested you may want to consider taking partials along the way. Daily tends to form a bias for you to look for trades so you stack the probabilities in your favour, in the case of yesterday since it was Monday, I looked at last Friday instead, session hi-lows and daily high-lows tend to have some significance.  
  
I found that looking at daily across a week tends to give some context, for some pairs but not all, I tend to see the majority of a move in the week made during Mon, Tuesday, Wednesday and pullbacks on Thursday and Friday. It doesn't always happen but enough times for me to pick up. Different pairs have different characteristics. You have to do your "homework" and learn the traits of the pairs you want to be trading.  
  
I suggest picking the session you want to be trading first and then the pairs when you are initially starting don't have too many pairs to work with, 1-3 should be sufficient if you don't see any set-ups as taught here for that day then just don't trade, **do not force it**

Asia session:  
  
Long UJ with a short rejection candle on the M15, trade went in favour till 2.6R but I wasn't monitoring so I got SL-ed with -1R.  
Long XAUUSD with a 1-2-3 pullback on the M15 with a short rejection candle at 2, running at the moment.  
  
For XAUUSD, yes I took a short last night and then another long this morning, in the grand scheme of things I am still short-biased, as long as the price doesn't hold above 2665, but **I'm not trying to predict what the market will do, I'm trying to react based on what the market is giving/ telling me.**  
  
Update: Both Asia session longs SL-ed totalling -2R @ as of London Session.  
  
London Session:  
Re-entered XAUUSD long at bottom of range @ 2648, it also has confluence with price entering the zone of Monday's low. Took some partials at earlier entry zone of Asia to make the XAUUSD pair risk-free.

Took 3 trades during the London session today, did some intra-day post-mortem which you can use as a reference for journaling if you haven't been doing so.  
  
You can refer to post #1201, for rating entries.  
  
1\. UJ Long  
B entry, zone in the middle (Asia high) is an area to take potential partials @ 3.3R. TP target of 7.5R rests nicely in yesterday's London session if it does go all the way up.  
  
Update: Exited full position @ +5R  
  
2\. Gold / XAUUSD Long (variation of okay entry  
Rejection candle came quite late into the session, B+ (variation with wick piercing zone but body closing within zone) entry, but still within the first 90 minutes of opening. TP of 7.5R rests nicely on the Asia session's high, with minimal congestion.  
  
Update: Exited full position @ +4R  
  
3\. GU Short  
Good opportunity for a short with the rejection candle wick piercing the zone **and** failing to close within. Would have been an A textbook entry based on Rob's system, but it got cut short by the inflation news spike. -1R  
Depending on how you view this trade, it could be considered a good loss because even though I got taken out, the trade still went in my favour later on.  
  
On the other hand, you could say that with a bigger SL, you might have prevented being SL-ed, but note that the risk/reward would have become unappealing to most. Given how narrow the trading range was earlier during Asian session, **I would say that such a statement could only be made with hindsight.**  
  
Hope today's trades have shown that **even A/ A+ entries will fail** , and **trading is all about stacking probabilities**. Don't beat yourself up if quality setups don't work out. Also, **don't get attached/ fall in love** with your trades/ entries. You are simply an operator, you see a shot you take it.  
  
If trades 1 and 2 hit their TP targets, I would sit out the rest of this week and only enter further trades if I see quality (A+) setups.

Hi Lol,  
This is a great post. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)

Morning  
Very nice clear thread. I have no idea why so little interest maybe it is people just chasing the latest thing on here, I will see how the method works for me over the next few months, not expecting too much next week as going into Christmas.  
But being able to look for a set up around the market opens suits me perfectly. I am uk based so should get plenty of volume on the opening push. I will try to keep things simple and just look at GB US. and GB JPY. And if you do not object will post what I see as a set up and anyone please feel free to comment, as we all learn from our mistakes.  
  
Thank you for you time

So little interest because lack of belief. They see the way I trade as too different from the way the books, trading courses and mentors teach them. So it cannot be real.  
This will be my last post for a while as finishing up for Christmas.  
This trade wasn't a 7.5R but not all are.

Your trade order needs to be in the right place at the right time.

I think, this is a very good thread. Strategy is simple, but requiring market study, chart and price action knowledge. With all other strategies I tried, everyone was saying, I need to check where is the SnR and then wait for indicators to align. Here, this is the SnR and no indicators.  
With simple horizontal lines at key levels, price is almost always reacting, where I'm anticipating. All I need is more patience, and calm mind.

Thanks Rob, great deal. Also at this time, after the positive news for the dollar, there was a good deal on the sale of the EURUSD pair. Sell 1.0408, sl 1.0415

Selling the pound against the dollar in the European session is not the best solution. But it would be just right against the yen. Verbal intervention from the Bank of Japan will help us. But the maximum profit would have been only 3R, otherwise the rebound before the news would have eaten up all the profits.

The Bank of Japan conducted a verbal intervention today. We are selling a pair of USDJPY, an unusual rejection candle, a pinbar. Therefore, we sell with a pending order Sell 157.04, sl 157.14 After two candles on the pin bar, the order is executed.

Well done Graf, ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)  
A message to everyone regarding finding trades.  
The setups that Graf has posted occur on the majority of days each month.  
Think about it, 7.5R trades, what's not to love about this system.  
Put the effort in. Learn about rejection candles.  
  
Some facts you need to be aware of:  
**If you buy and sell breakouts or wait for confirmation you will fail.**  
**If you base your trading decisions on indicators you will fail.**

Your trade order needs to be in the right place at the right time.

How I'll be trading in 2025?   
  
follow simple rules for entries and exits  
Cut-Losses-Short minus 1R  
Let-Profits-Run +2R to +5R, +7.5R would be bonus.  
  
GBPAUD ...same setup candle, same entry, different exit,

Hi Traders,  
You need only look at the 4hr Chart for clarity on what Gold may do.  
ITB is right more than wrong and has a great understanding of PA. If I wanted to know what gold was doing I would go to his thread.  
This chart is just my view.

Afternoon Rob  
  
Thank you for the reply. No live trades just looking at the market trying to see potential set ups. The above were not good. the second two on the same pairs much better as the Support Res was taken from before the christmas period.  
Will not post anything else until the market reopens.  
Regards Martin.

Had time to look at M15 TF today. Not a lot going on but saw an opportunity on AUDUSD. Only 6 pips but that's what I saw the market offering.

Traders not sharing the actual strategy here (NO INDICATORS) should not post anything. PLEASE stop coming into someone else's thread and just posting whatever you want. It's rude, disrespectful and wrong to the one who created this thread.

Hi Traders,  
BTC gave a short signal at London Open and for those wanting to add in on the trade there was a second rejection candle.

Hi S_Winner,  
  
1\. AU, AJ and UJ are my primary choice during Asian session.  
2\. AU, EU and GU are my primary choice during London session.  
3\. Sometimes I will trade the DAX during London open.  
4\. If I trade the US session, I would trade Nas100 or US500.  
5\. Having said that, I don't limit myself to the above pairs during these times.  
  
So, The question is I have for you is why do I trade these pairs during these times? 

Your trade order needs to be in the right place at the right time.

Hi Traders,  
Follow on BTC chart.  
If I am right I would expect BTC to reach TP1.  
Just my thoughts ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1) Nothing is guaranteed.  
Okay, I am starting to think TP 2 will be reached. Lets see how it goes.  
Trading is not about being right all the time, it is about following your system, placing the trade and accepting the outcome.

Just to add. If you had taken these trades you should be at breakeven.  
Not all trades work out as you expect. You still have to apply risk management to all trades.

Ok, So BTC has done its thing and looking like a bullish close on the 15m chart. I do not trade in the dead zone so no entry for me. I would expect it will drift around until US open. Catch you tomorrow.

These are the currencies that are the most volatile at the opening of these trading sessions.

Hi S_Winner,  
Volatile is not the right word.  
These are the pairs that are most active.  
Why?

Hi S_Winner,  
Without energy there is no movement.  
So you now know what to trade and when. 

Your trade order needs to be in the right place at the right time.

Entry was at 0930hrs Western Australia local time = according to the rules if I have read and understood them correctly = the last bar whereby entry can be made - from (0800-0930hrs local Western Australia time = ) Entry made at 0930hrs EURAUD Long Target +52.9 : SL -23 = 2.3 : 1 R:R BE set at 1:1 {image}

BE+1 set at 1:1 automatically set. Market moved to to +40 or more so moved BE+10 after the market moved to & hit the first Resistance zone and around +40 pips. Market then pulled back hit my Stop, just, then moved into my TP target & target was hit.... in fact it went so far as to move 4:1, showing that a 2.3:1 was on the cards to be taken from the market.  
Perhaps the lesson from this trade could be to set the trade and walk away and ignore the S/R zones? We will see.  
Result +10

Just taken a long on GU. Late entry but should be good.  
The correct entry was....  
Buy 1.2538, SL at 1.2535 (-3) and TP at 1.25605 (+22.5) 7.5R

I would never have taken that entry, so I will continue to read the thread and ascertain why that was a good S/R point to mark out on the charts.  
I understand the candle pattern you used though... and a 3 pip Stop is also new to me. 3 pips is no wiggle room from my past trading ... so this method you are demonstrating will take a while to settle into I suspect.  
  
Thank you Island for hanging around to give you inputs into what you are doing.

I am out of my trade at 1.25605 for a +17 (Original TP )which is not bad as I was late to the party. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f644.png?v=15.1)  
The chart shows the correct place to enter as per my system and also my actual trade.  
This is a good time to show why you have to enter on a rejection candle.  
So if I had been less lazy today that would have been 15R for the day but we will call it as it is with the second trade being a 2R.  
There was also a 7.5R trade yesterday making it 17R in two days.  
How many of you are hitting those numbers with your system?

Morning Sir  
  
Please excuse the question as I may have missed read the rules. The entry above was taken at 6.45 candle close UK Time. (Nice entry) But was it not 1 hour prior to the London open. I only ask as I did see it but was waiting for 8am.

Hi SR, You can use any colour background you like.  
Always plot H4 support and resistance on charts (Best using a faint colour)  
I have my charts side by side as it is easier to see the wicks  
Make sure you use the rectangle tool and plot correctly from body of candle to high or low of wick.

Hi Martin,  
It just depends on market activity at these times. I have been caught out before getting in early but I don't mind because I am only risking 1R on the trade and with winners being 7.5R you can make mistakes and you will still be way in front.  
You have to be fluid and flexible with your trading. Adapt to market conditions and always be prepared. 

Your trade order needs to be in the right place at the right time.

Just a note on timing the entry. You will find that the market will move into position in and around the opens.  
This is when you need to sit wait, and let the market show you your entry.  
Don't be afraid of tight stops, the rejection candle has happened for a reason so take advantage of it.

Hi SW,  
I am posting the correct entry for you and others to learn from. If I was in this trade it would still be open with a tight stop.  
Remember the market will show you the way at the opens.  
Where are your line charts? They will help you. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f642.png?v=15.1)

I looked at it this way.  
Entrance to the open Eurosessions.  
Why is this wrong?

Hi SW,  
My view is there is only one trade on EU and that was a long around London Open which is 10.15 Candle close.

Thank you for the explanation.

Hi Rob, thanks for your knowledge. I am journaling all your trades, especially taking notes on your entry + time of entry.  
  
I just have a question though, why wouldnt you consider the short at london open instead? We had a M15 bullish rejection.  
  
Thanks in advance

Another question, how about the previous 830pm candle rejection? What makes you take the 845pm rejection?

ACad  
3 times we have had rejection in the same zone for a Long. Late entry by 11 pips  
2.6R target  
SL set at -12 pips  
  
Review:  
SL hit. NY session closed with a gap just under SL ... it was not a smart move to enter 15 minutes before NY session closes trying to beat the increase in Spread that occurs at close of NY close.

Impulse move is up. I am always looking for the impulse move (Energy) and the weaker Pullback.

This is likely to be the trade entry. However I am always cautious taking trades just before major news as I use such tight stops. Lets see how things go with it.

Sometimes I place trade 1 or 2 seconds before the close of the rejection candle or 1 or 2 seconds after the close of rejection.  
I glad this has been mentioned. My apologies for not discussing this, I should have as it may have confused some of you.  
  
If the current candle is going to close as a rejection candle I will on occasion just put the order on.  
Any questions let me know.  
You have to be aware that the rejection candle is a strong rebound and if you are not quick enough you can miss an entry. Not always but just be aware of it.

There was impulse down and SNR level too

Hi D,  
Can you tell me my trading times and the pairs I trade during those times.  
When you post a chart with questions can you please post a line chart also.  
  
Actually I am not going to answer the question because it is so obvious that makes me think you have not read through the thread.  
I will help you but you have some work to do first.

Hi Rob,  
  
Apologies, here is the line chart.  
  
From my understanding, asian session starts at 7pm GMT +5. I have seen your previous post around GJ during asian session (17th december longs at 7pm NYT) that you have previously taken.

If there any traders that want help with this system I encourage you to start posting charts and asking questions.  
There is no such thing as a dumb question.  
I have not placed any trades today. There is red news out later and I believe that the market will likely react around US / News time.  
Something you have to remember about this system and trading in general is that, you do not need to trade every day.  
My results this week are..  
Monday +7.5R  
Tuesday +7.5R and +2R  
Wednesday no trade as yet.  
I am up 17R. Does it matter if I take anymore trades this week? I never chase the market trying to make trades appear. Your job is to wait.....wait.....attack and kick back.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60e.png?v=15.1)  
None of this ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f64f.png?v=15.1)  
How many of you are up 17R in 3 days?  
Even if I get a loss today and tomorrow I will still have made 15R for the week. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f37a.png?v=15.1)  
If you do post charts please include line chart.  
Thanks

I am currently short AU  
Update: SL at breakeven  
Anyone care to post a chart with my entry?  
  
I used the 30m line chart for the impulse move and pullback.  
I took trade on 15m at 10.15. I went to breakeven as I believe price action will be messy during this session.  
SL was -4 with TP at +30 (7.5R)  
Any questions from those lurking in the shadows ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f600.png?v=15.1)

Just got back in.  
Au looking good at the moment. Ideally I would like to be out before any news. Main thing is to follow the system rules.  
  
My TP is 0.61981 (+30)  
SL is still at breakeven.  
Note: Always have your TP within the daily range.  
AU daily range is 46.6. It has done 34.2 pips so far today, that gives me enough room to TP

Hi SW,  
You will need to work on your entry. It has to be at the right time and price because your stops will be too big for 7.5R   
It's early days though, it's good you got in the trade for the experience.

Hi Rob, please may I ask, my GU BE yesterday. I didnt notice upon entry but 4HR was just ahead - is that where or why your TP was smaller for your GU trade? Many thanks

I was late getting into GU trade however my TP stayed the same as if I had entered the trade at the correct price.  
You are also correct with the 4h resistance.

I am long GA. Chart to follow  
  
This is a difficult set up to trade. Could be a stop out and re-enter if it pulls back further.  
I won't go into detail of the setup as it rarely occurs. Just thought I would post my daily trade.

GA trade update: SL moved up (+9) 1.5R to lock in some profit. I'll post chart when trade completed.  
SL Moved up to (+21) 3.5R  
I'll post trade when completed.  
Trade completed Trailing SL hit for (+21) 3.5R While in the trade I was looking at charts and noted H4 resistance at 1.9926 of which I should have been more vidulent  
but too late. Never mind, It shows I make mistakes.  
Total for the week is (+28R)

As I am going through the thread, whilst I am in the back ground, may I ask if this chart set / template as far as colours go is suitable for you to make your assessments when I come back to posting after working through the thread's posts up to current?  
I find bright screens quite distracting and I was not able to make the ADR numbers white in the settings in order to use a black back ground.

gold target hit.  
  
do not give up. try try try again and again this method for at least 6 months.  
until you obtain 70% win rate  
then shift to live account and trade the smallest size.  
pay your tuition fees and learn.  
it will take at least 2 - 3 years to be proficient.  
know it like the back of your hand.  
it is always a work in progress.  
without this seriousness and persistent hard work, you won't succeed.  
in the end, at the end of the rainbow, you reap what you sow.  
the harvest will be plentiful.

29R for the week is superb!  
May I ask if there is anything you follow for breaking even during set ups - or is it more a feeling thing?

Hi M,  
I stick to my trade plan / system 100%, however there are times though when I am happy to exit a trade or go to breakeven.  
You have to remember I am at the computer nearly all day and have 30+ years of trading. Saying that "Anything can happen"  
I prefer to place the trade and leave it.  
We are aiming for 7.5R winners. We won't always get them and going to breakeven has its risks.  
Stick with placing the trade, set a 1R SL and 7.5R TP and go to break even when trade is 4R and see how you go.  
  
I am watching AU again for shorts

Hi M,  
I make mistakes all the time but brush them off straight away.  
I say to myself, ADM.  
Accept it, Deal with it and move on.  
If you are afraid to make mistakes you will not succeed.

I have been caught out before getting in early but I don't mind because I am only risking 1R on the trade and with winners being 7.5R you can make mistakes and you will still be way in front. You have to be fluid and flexible with your trading. Adapt to market conditions and always be prepared.

Afternoon  
  
And thank your for your reply. I know we can get the push from either the frankfurt open or london just not wanting to post trades that broke your rules.

I always look for the first impulse and pullback for entry, after that you are decreasing your odds of a 7.5R winner

Might have missed the GJ rejection candle but also tradable.

Hi Costa,  
Be aware of the market open impulse move of the day.  
I find that it is good to use previous support and resistance but all the action is based on the current days activity.  
You are looking for the most recent impulse and pullback, support and resistance. 

Your trade order needs to be in the right place at the right time.

Hello Island,  
  
I am trying to work through drawing levels and understand or feel comfortable in feeling ok with most levels being taught / indicated as being appropriately placed...but not this example ...  
Why is there a 2nd support zone on such as short bullish candle with a very small wick? why not just extend the top rectangle to include the lower rectangle?

This idea is new to me as well Island. The mindset for myself that I may need to work on... is that this is revenge trading and it is best to wait for a new setup the next day.  
So how many times can we have another crack?  
If I may answer the question to see if I am more or less on the right track, we can make additional trades during the same session's trading time... in the example you had shown, this would mean as many times as you like between 0300 - 0400hrs chart time during the Asian.

Still at school reading the thread. I'm coming through the process. Be there as soon as I can. Trying to prevent same Q's being repeatedly asked.  
Application of the lessons is where the action needs to be, & a well understood and necessary phenomenon.

AC Long 7.5R from base of Red bar, but due to Spread and time of entry its a bit smaller RR  
  
Trade review:  
  
TP hit.  
I feel the entry bar was identified properly, late entry and will improve upon this as we go.  
RR was not the same as 7.R as I am trying to deal with my head in the Spread taking me out with pullbacks in the past couple of weeks, and then the trade hitting the TP.  
29.2 : 13.5 = 2.16R  
  
edit, entry price with wick pips at entry to the high & not including the Spread in setting SL or TP was 9R

EJ Short 7.5R from base of wick, but due to Spread, a bit less.

Thank you for your advice ITB.  
  
When looking at my Daily chart, is the way in which I set one of my SR zones incorrect, or do we pay more heed to a more recent SR zone?

it is the most recent one to the current market price.  
however sometimes there is none to be found, then look at the historical one or at other higher time frames.

[quote=SolidRockk;15115333]  
  
AC Long 7.5R from base of Red bar, but due to Spread and time of entry its a bit smaller RR  
  
Trade review: TP hit. I feel the entry bar was identified properly, late entry and will improve upon this as we go.  
  
RR was not the same as 7.R as I am trying to deal with my head in the Spread taking me out with pullbacks in the past couple of weeks, and then the trade hitting the TP. 29.2 : 13.5 = 2.16R  
****edit**** , entry price with wick pips at entry to the high & not including the Spread in setting SL or TP was 9R

Just checking please.  
  
a 1 pip wick is invalid for an entry?

Review:  
  
SL hit. ITB posted as to why the trade was not in an ideal place & has clarified where my SR zone was incorrectly applied in this trade.

EA Long  
Retest of SR with a Rejection  
wick is 8 pips = R  
R x 7.5R = 60 as target.  
Spread is around 4.5 pips so added to SL it is set to -12.5

Hi SR,  
Well done on posting your trades. You are utilizing the line chart / SnR / Candle charts as they should be used.  
In regards to how much wick on a rejection bar should be, I like to see 2 pips as a minimum and 10 pips as a maximum.  
AU trades I use a 2 or 3 pip SL and for example GJ would be a 10 pip SL. Being in mind I pay commission on my trades so no spread to deal with.  
I noticed on your EA chart that the spread is 4.2 pips where as mine is 0.7 pips. I have recently opened an account that had a spread instead of commission and I dislike it immensely. I have had more stop being hit as they widen the spread as market activity increases.  
You will be better off with a commission broker in my opinion.  
I have attached the [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") from each broker.

Hi SR,  
This is the 4 hr line chart of EA. It shows clearly at what price you should get a reaction / rejection from.  
I shorted EA this morning.

Thank you Island. I happen to have a Live a/c with one of those companies as well. Your indicators (set at defaults) and template is now properly installed, with the ADR & Spread actually working etc.

Yes. As you saw in my chart, my SR's are similarly placed to your own.  
After yesterdays EJ continuance of a trend, I was observing what I thought was a similar situation. However, ITB's clarification of the most recent SR is of higher weight and therefore my having a Short bias should have been my plan prior to pulling the trigger. ie: yesterday's chart between EJ & today's EA are not similar.  
Thank you for your clarity.

Plan  
15-1-25  
EJ  
ADR @ start of session 138. Market has moved approx 100  
  
Daily is low 40 pips or so from Support.  
H4 also near the same Support  
m30 similar to above 2 charts. A minor support rejection seems to have formed at open of this No Indicator session. I will disregard this bar.  
  
Bias is Long at Support. Wait for rejection bar, if it happens this trading session.  
  
Adjustment: If market hits Support, the ADR of 138 will be hit  
**all of my ADR on all charts are saying 138, so the indicator must not be currently working properly for me as yet.**  
  
End of Session.  
Review: Entry requirements not met. No trade taken.

Love the thread!  
  
I have been reading through and just wondering how you define an impulse move, sorry if it’s a silly question. I can see it’s a large move that breaks a high or low, just wondered if you have any actual requirements for the move?

Just entered this trade on demo account. Am I on the right track here? Also I set 7 R:R and it seems massive way off so not sure if I’m correct here.

UsdCad. Entered short at 12.45 on the rejection of long bull 15m candle at the high of the 4hr candle. Stop was 6 pips, TP 4R was previous swing low. Despite price went approx. 10R in my way, I'm happy. It could easily spike back and stop me.

An example of a Short that i did not believe in with my marking up. Trade Short not taken. Big Mistake - Huge. TP 7.5R already reached in 1 bar.  
A lesson learned i think.

Plan London Session  
16-1-25  
  
GU  
D1 - At Support  
H4 - At Support, possible DB  
m30 - At Support with rejection bars at 1830hrs chart time with a pin bar. A second rejection bar 1hr before session start.  
  
Projected entry: Long at Support with a rejection bar.  
  
Adjustment: Missed entry - open of 2nd bar during the session shows SL would have been hit but now market is above close of previous m30 bar. Long entry taken. Not sure of which bar to take as the which to use & have decided to use current bar wick size for calculation of just under 7.5R. Target is 75 pips.

Plan 17-1-25  
  
UJ  
D1 - Market is at a level at the Bottom = Support. DT still could continue though. Possible consolidation point.  
H4 - Market at Support  
m30 - Market at Support  
  
Bias is consolidation = possible Long or Short.  
  
Projected entry: Long off close of a H4 rejection bar sync with m30 rejection bar.  
  
Adjustment: H4 bar was not a rejection bar. Wait and see if one forms at the next close m30bar.  
  
review: No rejection bar. No trade taken.  
There was a rejection later on, but this occurred outside of the methods trading times.

Plan 17-1-25  
  
GA  
D1 - At Support

Adjustment: Entry triggered for the Long. 7.5R

Review:  
First complete success TP 7.5R, +60 pips  
  
Seems this was an excellent entry. The trade took 28 to 28.5hrs to complete. Emotionally seemed like forever, especially after the entries were noted retrospectively on the 16ths US Session's Trading Window for other currency pairs when assessing for new entries on the 17th Asian Session Trading Window period... There was a lot of US News coming up for the US Session on the 17th, however, the trade looks like it completed prior to the news -and you can see what the multiple news events did to PA during the US...  
Happy with my trade.

Review + Results of first week trading this system with Commission & not Spread account.  
  
Pips are in profit. Much better result than when using Spread a/c.  
I have enjoyed just watching the 4 bar closes over a 90 minute time frame.  
Having the Trading Window time during the appropriate session & then leave the trading station once done & forget until next booked session is a very relaxing way to trade.

I think that you should focus on the Asian session, which is always flat, and in no case look for purchases when the price is below the range of the Asian session and do not look for sales when the price is above the range of the Asian session. Because London always has high trading volumes and some price movements

About 90% of my winning trades are opened during the Asian Session.

Thought I would post some details on how I prepare for trading, trade selection , trade entry, SL and TP.  
  
**Preparation for the Asian Session.**  
I start my day by opening up the following Pairs.  
AU, AJ, UJ, EA, GA, EJ and GJ.  
I can view all these pairs at the same time as I use dual monitors.  
Note: It is important to view different time frames with each pair. I start with 4hr line and candle charts side by side.  
I then go to 30m charts and finally 15m charts.  
What an looking for is the most important thing which is HTF support and resistance.  
It is of the highest importance that you have SnR plotted on your charts.  
I just want to add that although I look at seven pairs I place the greatest emphasis on AU, AJ and UJ.  
The reason is because you can get all the information from these pairs of what might be the mover for the session / day.  
Why is this? It is because AU is the base currency pair for AJ, GA and EA and UJ is the base currency pair for AJ, EJ and GJ.  
It is better to do your analysis on three pairs rather than seven.  
  
**Note:**  
If AU is rallying and AJ is also going up then EA and GA will be going down, this is showing a strong AU move up is the likely direction for the session.  
If AU is rallying and AJ is falling then I would expect EA and GA to be ranging and so I would turn my attention to UJ because it is likely that the J's are moving down.  
  
**Finding the right pair:**  
When I have identified the currency that is likely to be the mover for the session I immediately look to see where support and resistance is compared to price.  
Today is was UJ Sell. The following chart should assist in the above notes.  
The first chart is my 4hr SnR chart, this is used to identify Higher time frame SnR. On this chart I have an indicator to auto-plot the SR levels.  
  
**Note:**  
**I always double check the SR levels manually, do not rely on an indicator.**

The next chart is the 1hr time frame. I am looking at this chart to get a close up of the price action around the 4hr resistance.  
You will notice that UJ had a go at trading higher yesterday before the close.

If I have done my analysis correctly I will place the trade, set the SL and TP  
It is important that you are well prepared before you place any trades.  
I hope this helps you understand how I approach trading each day.  
Remember you only need 1 or 2 winners a week to be a very successful trader.

Hi Island,  
Yes I wasn't feeling comfortable with the number of fails for the two weeks prior. So your recommendation to go commission a/c was very well received. Thank you.  
Thank you for your words of encouragement.  
I have decided just to publish 1 trade per session so that we can leave room for others may also join in for their learning. There's no point being a hog. Slow and steady...

Hi Rob,  
  
Thank you very much for sharing your system and know-how. I have some questions to your last post.......  
  
I do not see any 123 or DT formation on 15M. I guess your entry was "the advanced" one, am I right?  
4H and 1H rejection candles were not finished when you entered, correct? It means DT on 1H was not there yet, is it?  
  
I wish I could trade it like you one day![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f64f.png?v=15.1)

Maybe you can try using indicators that are designed to open purchases when the price is above the zone and sell when the price is below the zone

Hi, maybe a silly question but if I don't ask I won't know!  
  
If AU is rallying and AJ is falling, then I would expect EA and GA to be ranging and so I would turn my attention to UJ because it is likely that the J's are moving down. If AJ is falling, I thought that would mean that J is stronger so J's would be moving up, why are you saying this? Just something I need to understand, thank you!

Plan 21-1-25  
  
EJ..edit... correction, AJ  
  
D1 - Consolidation midway point between swings  
H4 - Finishing a DT swing down  
m30 - At bottom of Support zone with a small wick on current bar  
  
Adjustment - Strong unscheduled High Impact news from USA = impulse move down of 50 pips  
  
Projected Entry: Strong reaction to news means we stay out of entry at open of session. Plus the wick is larger than 10 pips.  
Long after one hour has passed with an appropriate retest of rejection bar at Support zone.  
  
Adjustment: 1 hour later I was not happy to enter - gut feeling. Waited another 30 min, no rejection bar at close.  
No entry taken this session

Hi 1Hr,  
You will need to monitor the pairs for a month and you will see the correlation between pairs. If you require further information I will post some examples. 

Your trade order needs to be in the right place at the right time.

22-1-25  
Plan Asian Session Window  
A tricky day for me to choose a target currency pair. Most pairs seem or appear in the middle & unlikely to show an entry in the next 90 min.  
  
EA  
D1 - Upward Ranging between previous L & the LH  
H4 - At the bottom of the previous swing low  
m30 - At the Support zone  
  
Note: Daily is heading up, H4 & m30 are at the Bottom & in the Support zone.  
  
Projected entry: Long with a Rejection bar at Support  
  
Adjustment: After checking the H1 bar, we have a Red Rejection candle with a suitable wick. Demo entry Long 7.5R = 52.5 pips = around the 1.66628. SL set at 1.6600 which just so happens to be a whole number.  
  
Adjustment: 7 hours after entry, market has moved more than 2.5R from entry. Moved SL to BE+1  
  
Review: Market did not reach 7.5R before it turned South at the first Resistance point of contact with a Rejection candle = a warning to exit there at around 3R.  
BE+1 was hit after market traveled +33 (4.7R) into the desired direction of target.  
The entry was good. Managing the trade as an autopilot failed (set & forget). If an eye was kept for the duration of the trade it was possible to have taken 3R from the market.

Just sharing an example of a trade from the Asian Session Window...  
  
Although there was not a trade entry on the m30 at open, yet if I had of opened a H1 chart, there was an obvious entry.  
TP on that trade has almost reached 7.5R , it has reached 7R

Plan  
  
GA  
  
D1 - At Support  
H4 - At Support for the 4th time in the past 5.5 days. Looking for a Breakout  
m30 - At Support  
  
Projected entry: Look out for a Breakout. Long at open of Asian Trading window with a Red Rejection candle. Or a Short with a 1-2-3. With only 90 min to trade with a Short is not likely to meet the requirement of entering within that timeframe. Trailing of 16 = 2.5R in case I miss manually moving to BE+1  
  
Review: Within 15 min market rejected my entry & Sl hit. Result is -1R  
  
Adjustment: Red Rejection candle at open, entry Long. TP 45, SL 6.5

Plan 24-1-25  
London Session Window  
  
Not many pairs left with enough room with ADR movement since the Asian opened.  
  
UCad  
  
D1 - market is at lower 1/3rd higher then of previous Low : previous High. Ranging  
H4 - Ranging around the Lower Support. Possible DB at current time of plan writing.  
m30 - Looks like a possible DB.  
  
Projected entry: Long off Rejection bar after a 1-2-3 on the 15min & or 5m bar. Might limit RR to less than 7.5R  
  
Adjustment: Entry requirements met 1hr into trading window with m30 candle. Missed entry as i was looking at another entry that had my attention. Pending Buy Limit 1 or 2 pips under open bar price.  
  
Adjustment: Buy Limit triggered at 0720 chart time. 20 min after actual entry was met.  
SL hit shortly after. -1R

27-1-25  
Trading Window London Session  
  
UCad  
  
D1 - Ranging up the top looking for a Breakout - a bit of a mess actually  
H4 - Market is close to SnR from 14 or so bars ago.  
m30 - At an SnR up top. Probably Resistance  
  
Projected entry: Short off SnR with a rejection candle  
  
Review: Entry requirements were not met. No trade taken.

28-1-25  
Plan Asian Window  
  
GA  
  
D1 - Up top in an upswing trend  
H4 - Up top in an upswing trend  
m30 - Market is above the SnR  
  
Notes: Upswing, market above SnR.  
  
Projected entry: Long with a pullback 1,2,3 at SnR as Support.  
  
There was a rejection bar at the close of the open session window, however it was 12 pips measurement of the wick and so no entry made with the wick larger than 10 pips.  
Market has moved more than 2.3R into the projected Long.  
  
No trade taken.

Hey everyone!  
I've been testing this strat for a few months straight using an emulator in forward-only mode. With a few adjustments of my own, over the course of 3-5 years, I average **4% per month**. Maybe someone would be willing to share how are you doing and what is your average gain over the long course? I have no idea how good that 4% is and how much could I aim for in the future.

Hi Eval,  
If you don't mind me asking. What is your risk on opening a trade? 1%, 2% etc.  
Your 4% a months is way too low in my opinion.  
  
  
Maybe post some charts so I can see if I can help 

Your trade order needs to be in the right place at the right time.

I always risk 1%, but my TP is 5%, not 7,5% (according to my results over a few years, 5% ensures the biggest gains for my style of trading.) I am not saying I'm disappointed, because before I settled on one strategy, I was always in the -%. I'm going to analyze all my trades after finishing 5-year testing and see what adjustments would have brought better results. From my point of view, I don't miss good entries, but I need to find a way to identify and avoid bad setups.  
Here are a few unsuccessful trades:

Hi Eval, I will take a look at the charts this evening and get back to you. Do you use a commission or spread broker?  
Can you let me know the dates of these trades you've posted?  
Regards  
Rob

Sorry I forgot to add dates. I will add more charts with dates. As I am only testing, I'm not using any broker right now (Until I'm happy with potential gains), but I am planning to pick a broker with commissions, otherwise there will be a lot of SL hits I think. Thanks in advance, Rob.

Good evening Island.  
  
May I ask something that is bothering me.  
Sure I don't have a true commission broker but Spread is way down compared to the other I used.  
  
I am finding that entries are relatively ok to spot, but the creep back or pullback past the wick seems to be very frequent & then results in the trade going into the direction of the target after that wick is taken down/out with the creeping of the market. And the next bar does not allow for a re-entry point that seems to be reasonable for a target of 7.5R  
  
Below is an example of the UCad for todays London session window.  
Should we be placing the SL at the blue wick plus in my instance the Spread 0.9 pips or thereabouts, or do we give a larger breather?  
If a larger breather, what is a general rule of thumb to use?  
In this example, the UCad essentially did a 7.5R by the close of the session window & if not would be at least set to BE.... if it were not for the wick on the top end of the candle on the very next candle after entry.  
  
Many thanks for your perspective.

Please tell me, is it an important rule to open trades within 1.5 hours after the session opens?  
Can there be exceptions or not?

Hi Evaldas,  
I did not realize your charts are from 2022 It would take more time going over these charts than I have left ;-)  
If you have trades in the last six months it would be helpful. Also are you looking at line charts before you place trades?  
A line chart will tell you everything you need to spot the trade.  
I very rarely trade EU as I prefer the Asian session and I know a high percent of winners are during this time.  
My system has set rules regarding time of entry and the pairs to trade during those times.  
I see many traders tweaking my rules because they cannot trade the Asian session.  
If I was to trade EU it would be at London open but I would also be watching GU, EG, and GER40. You cannot rely on just one pair.  
I hope this helps.  
Let me know if you need help with anything ;-) 

Your trade order needs to be in the right place at the right time.

Hi S_winner,  
My trading times are the first 1.5hrs of market open then the market slows down. Saying that recently there have been setups at all different times, even before market open. I put this down to recent political events causing uncertainty. If you have a setup out of these hrs and the market is buzzing why not give it a go.  
With a high RR you can afford a few losers. It is the only way to learn.  
Regards  
Rob

Thank you. I'm focusing on one currency pair now, and I'll try the other ones once I'm able to feel this one. Forgot to mention that the 4% average is only using one EU pair, so I want to believe that the results will be better with several pairs.

Hi Eval,  
First chart AU Sell.  
There was nothing wrong with your trade entry. It would have been a 3Pt SL with a 23Pt TP (7.5R) for me  
If you were using 5R as TP you would be looking at a TP of 0.6252 which market did not reach.  
We had strong support at 0.6250 (Round Number) which has turned the market.  
It is interesting that price is hovering around the same price six days later.  
This is a case of knowing where your support zone is and working out the odds of risk.  
Support may have broken but we never know.  
If you were going for 5R maybe lock in 2R as price approached support.

Morning  
EU trade, entered short at the blue(arrow) rejection candle close and daily open confluence, SL was conservative 6 pips, closed for 2R. Missed the previous red rejection candle from support.  
Slowly I'm getting hang of this style of trading. I'm focusing on 4 pairs only.

How many R profits did you manage?  
  
For those who traded the next 4-hours into the US session open, then +12R would be your bonus.  
  
Your exits is more important than your entry.   
  
IF you want to maximize profit, be prepared to give back to the market 50% of what the market has already given you. Plan your trade exit strategy based on this belief and manage your trades exits.

How do you managing your exits? When do you moving your SL, do you giving your trades breathing room to move?  
  
Thanks

There are different options hot to manage trades.  
  
Develop your trading system' Exit Strategy based on this :   
  
  
**Option One:**  
"Cut-Losses-Short, Let Profits Run".  
  
For example, when you trade plan has the potential to run 5R, then your Stop Loss is minus 1R.  
Trade management would be simple and easy, juts use 'Set-and-Forget' and you do not need to move your initial SL and let the market decide.  
  
**Option Two:**  
Manage your trade by moving your initial SL using the R-Multiple.  
To maximize profit, be prepared to give back to the market 50% of the move i.e. protect 50% of the move.

Watch this youtube video and learn something about Risk Management and how a Money Management based trading system can generate good cash flow when you know how to integrate both Lotto model and Insurance model into a CashFlow model.  
Think of low risk trading idea for every trade and better reward of +3R and above for every trade. You Do Not need high win rate.

\- Daily does not look good  
  
\- 4Hr is a possibility  
  
\- my preference is still to wait for market to make its move above the psych level 100000.  
  
\- but I can also play the LTF scalping

Hi Traders,  
It's been a while since I posted here. I took this trade this morning.  
It was a basic return to support. When I saw a rejection candle above support I entered trade with 3.8 lots.  
SL was -15 which was slightly more than I like to use but that is down to market conditions.  
As the SL was high I was not able to get 7.5R and settled for 5.7R. +86 Pips

trading can be as simple or complex as you want it to be.  
knowing that a mini trend had started in the lower time frames?  
higher high higher low. break and retest, break and retest.

This post shows the simplicity of trading, we as traders are the ones that make it complex.  
Good post ITB ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)

Hi Traders,  
1st trade of the week.  
Went long using the Bearish Red Rejection Candle off support.  
initial SL was higher than I normally use, but if you like the trade you've gotta pay the price.  
Soon after entry I was able to go to breakeven.  
SL now at +12  
I have set a TP of 120Pts. Will it reach it, who knows ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)

Hi Traders,  
I am not answering any more questions relating to this system. I am just going to post my trades when I see fit. Hopefully one day someone will see the benefit of trading Rejection Candles.

> Hi Traders, 1st trade of the week. Went long using the Bearish Red Rejection Candle off support. initial SL was higher than I normally use, but if you like the trade you've gotta pay the price. Soon after entry I was able to go to breakeven. SL now at +12 I have set a TP of 120Pts. Will it reach it, who knows ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1) {image} Update SL moved to +36 2R Update SL moved to +53 3R Update SL moved to +83 4.5R Update SL moved to +98 5.4R Tradingview entries {image}

Hey everyone, what are your thoughts on this UC entry?  
Daily: double top with rejection candle and lower highs  
H4: 1-2-3 and trend support was broken recently.  
M30: Double top and a legit rejection candle.  
  
Do you wait for many confirmations as such, or a couple of them are enough in your system?

Hi Evaldas  
  
Im watching only 15m and 4hr tf, this is enough for me. On 4hr you can easily identify overall trend, on 15m then look for good entries in the trend direction.

Hi Traders,  
I have done my analysis for entering trades on Monday 17 03 2025.  
The market may prove me wrong however this is my plan and I will stick to it.  
The main thing I am looking for is a move away from key support and resistance and enter a low risk trade on a Rejection Candle.  
The Rejection Candle Entry is unique way that I developed to enter trades with a small Stop loss and a high TP which allows me to generate high yielding trades.  
I will post my trades tomorrow as they happen to demonstrate the effectiveness of trading Rejection Candles.

Hi Traders,  
Took a 1R stop out on AU, I had got the short completely wrong. It happens.  
I got into EJ long with my Rejection Candle.  
I am looking at 11R if target gets hit.

Updated the TP target to 12R.  
Why the TP so far away. Well it isn't really that far away and it is within the average daily range.  
I don't know what will happen to this trade, it may reverse sharply.  
I have locked in some $ so I'll let it do its thing.

EJ Update.  
Price pulling back to my SL. It has been a good trade and I have locked in some good funds.  
I have updated the chart.

All out for +9.75R (9R after Commission). It may continue up to my 16R TP but I'm done for the day.  
+$832.00 after commission, not bad for a $93 risk trade.

I know I said I was done but had to take this short off Resistance.  
Mainly due to nice Rejection Candle. Trade is at breakeven.  
Initial SL was (-18), TP is (+130) 7.2R

Mate,

You will find the answer on a line chart.  
Plot the rectangle from the body of one candle and the wick of the other, this will give you buy and sell zones.

@fxpider  
  
It means highest close and highest wick. I like also clear rules but market don't care about that.  
More important how we drawn the zone is how price is acting / reaction with the zone.

Highest close for sure but not necessarily the highest wick. If I am not mistaken, [Islandfx911](https://www.forexfactory.com/islandfx911) meant the wick of the highest open. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)

i think it is the first rejection candle that closed beyond the zone.

however it still depends on the trader whether he is right there at the right moment or prefer to see more confirmation in his direction.  
and the entry time frames one looks at.

if it is about drawing of supply zone, then they have the same base, the same rectangle low.  
if it is about drawing of demand zone, then i use the 2nd drawing with wider zone.

You must, monitor the swings and use the last validated swing high or swing low on a Line Chart.  
Then flick the same chart to candles.  
Then adjust the rectangle so that it is on the highest wick and the closing candle body.  
You then have your Buy / Sell Zones.

Hi Mate,  
I am out of AU short for +1. I could see the main move was over extended that's why I am long now but I cannot discuss my entry as it will confuse others.  
All I can say it is a Rejection Candle.  
Trade is now at +1.

Hello Rob,  
This is what I had for GA this morning which didn't come to fruition.  
Any nuggets of wisdom for me? Or do I just need more time and experience to spot them like you do ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)
