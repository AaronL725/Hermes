A lot of trader's lack focus and we going to be all about discipline. one approach consistent and keeping to that.   
  
When we win. we will be looking to maximising our wins, Losses kept small. + plus management techniques that you've probably never thought about.

A bit about Dean Malone, he taught many traders on how to trade side by side with the ADR. It was very useful when trading using the currency basket. Perhaps I could learn another trading strategy from this thread.  
  
This thread reminds me one indicator which I had used past years.

it's good to have experience. I prefer that, as long you follow the strategy as set, it may add something to you.

Thank you... by the way. Dean M room is now closed. but if we can share what we learned from there.. nobody has a lock and key on knowledge. so that's what we're here for.

I haven't made a post in FF for a very long time, but seeing the reaction of people (considering there are just 40 hours since launching and only three pages), I just felt like putting a few words here.  
  
I've known Ensale for a while now, so everyone who got accepted in his group, is definitely in very good hands.

That's a good one, a clear high in that example. Which differentiates from the one I shared, which Is a retracement of the trend and a double top for the continuation trade.   
  
Thank you for showing that..

And as mentioned in the image, wick's above your the previous top by 1 pip. (The first high), this may seem insignificant but is highly significant. will go into a little more detail soon.  
  
But first we Go through the double top's.

The double Top you highlight is the same example I shared. maybe it's an opportunity to share something else. {image} And as mentioned in the image, wick's above your the previous top by 1 pip. (The first high), this may seem insignificant but is highly significant. will go into a little more detail soon. But first we Go through the double top's.

There you go!  
  
By the way for the thread viewer's. The double top does not require this wick above (1 pip or so pips) for it to be traded.. it is a factor for your brain to consider.  
  
If in your study and trading you discover it add's probability or increases your confidence then use it. I will go into more detail about it soon.. why it occurs etc..  
  
Will keep it simple for now.

Take a look at this one on UJ Day chart.  
  
450 pip run since.   
  
In my own private group, I informed the traders off the upcoming (possible) bearish run, we've proceeded to make great pip's from this run. If you don't like the daily, you can take this information and go down the time frames.   
  
Some videos for you folks to watch next. and that will be it for today for folks to catchup..  
  
Have a great day!

Hello ensale and Friends,  
  
Here is what I see on the H4 AJ showing a bullish double-bottom and larger bearish double-top reversal patterns with the second candle being a pip or more longer in the reverse direction:

Again most important thing is the entry, some will argue with this. If you don't have a good entry to the market, you give money to the market. second thing we need to learn is patience.  
  
you're trading hourly/H4, you will be waiting for a few days at times to make trades.  
  
"Your paid to wait"  
  
Second the mentality has to be right, your mentality is different to scalping 10/30 pips . will go into the mentality a bit more. because it's vitally important. without it you have no chance.

Same bleeding thing! Double top. (right one wick's slightly higher), and if your (MR) confirmation bingo man. wait for the arrow to confirm the 20 EMA cross and as a result have a 50 pip stop above that smaller bearish candle instead of the larger 100 pip bear candle..  
  
Fundamental's that give you more confidence, an opportunity, and there's the setup.  
  
Nice chart hitan.. thanks.

Fundamental's that give you more confidence, an opportunity, and there's the setup. Nice chart hitan.. thanks.

> Again most important thing is the entry, some will argue with this. If you don't have a good entry to the market, you give money to the market. second thing we need to learn is patience. you're trading hourly/H4, you will be waiting for a few days at times to make trades. "Your paid to wait" Second the mentality has to be right, your mentality is different to scalping 10/30 pips . will go into the mentality a bit more. because it's vitally important. without it you have no chance.

And the Big outside bar is the first indication of big player's changing direction. it is then on the retrace that we look for them to prove the point.

Here is an interesting bearish H4 GU going with the major trend over the last month, week and day - so I went over my PA analysis and hope to see how if the last few DJ + Bearish PB candles breaking consolidation support the methods here...I know this is not an obvious bearish setup, but hope for some feedback:

Thank you...I believe I really love your approach here and look forward to any future group videoconferencing. Over the weekend I will try training on the FxBlue Trading Simulator V3 on the GJ. I read that this may be the best pair for the LON and TO overlap period - I am not sure. I will obviously test the other as well, especially the UJ. Have a great weekend to you and the others here on this great now FF Thread!

I don't call anything a fake signal LOL. I call it a trap. your experience in this trading will help you to learn to avoid them.   
  
Nonetheless any setup has losses no matter what you do.

The biggest driver of currency flows this past week had nothing to do with monetary policy or economic data. Instead, the escalation of tensions between the U.S. and North Korea sent USD/JPY sharply lower as investors worry that this heated exchange could result in military action. Although we firmly believe that the threat of war — let alone nuclear war — is slim, as this era has been one of the most unpredictable in history. Bottom line? Be prepared for the unexpected. Many of our readers are asking how far the dollar could fall if the U.S. goes to war with North Korea but before discussing this, we want to point out that while the dollar is down sharply this week versus the yen, it strengthened against other major currencies like sterling and Australian and New Zealand dollars. So while there’s no question that war is negative for USD/JPY, it can initially drive the dollar higher against high-beta currencies such as AUD and NZD. As a rule of thumb, the Japanese yen and Swiss franc perform best during times of war, which means all the yen crosses, including USD/JPY, will weaken.  
Taking a look at some of the major military conflicts over the past 3 decades, the Dollar Index suffers greatly when there is war. Not only does the cost of war require an expansion of money supply, commodity prices also tend to rise, putting additional pressure on the U.S. economy. In the 2 months from when the conflicts in Libya started, the Dollar Index dropped nearly 5% while during the first 3 months of the second Gulf War, the index fell more than 9%. We saw similar weakness after the first Gulf War and then later when there were missile attacks on Baghdad. U.S. stocks tend to perform poorly, though generally during the month before war begins rather than the month after. This time around, how currencies behave depends largely on how China responds. If China stays neutral and doesn’t provide any support to North Korea, the yen, Australian and New Zealand dollars will have a smaller reaction (although still a big one) than if China inserts itself in the conflict. Since there’s no doubt that North Korea will lose and lose quickly, as the tensions grow the dollar will suffer and the actual announcement of war could take USD/JPY to 105. But if a swift victory transpired, the pair would recover quickly. The bottom line is that the outlook for USD/JPY is grim and 108.50/108.00 is probably the next stop for the pair.  
Aside from the threat of war, U.S. data has been far from impressive with jobless claims rising as inflationary pressures remain subdued. Monetary policy committee members aren’t happy with the current state of inflation and their feelings are reinforced by the weaker-than-expected consumer- and producer-price reports. According to Fed President Dudley, it will take some time for inflation to rise to 2% as the weaker dollar affects import prices. As a result, year-over-year price measures will be depressed for a while and the economy may be a bit more sluggish on the margin. Dudley is one of the main architects of Fed policy and his cautious views confirm that the central bank is in no rush to raise interest rates. This sentiment is shared by FOMC voter Evans and Fed President Bullard. Looking ahead, the most important releases on the U.S. calendar will be the FOMC minutes and U.S. retail sales. Although consumer spending could be supported by the rise in wages and rally in stocks, the Fed minutes are likely to be less hawkish as the central bank doesn’t seem to want to commit much beyond September balance-sheet normalization.  
Meanwhile, the risk aversion created by U.S./North Korea tensions also put significant pressure on commodity currencies. The New Zealand dollar was the worst performer and more losses are likely in the coming week. According to Governor Wheeler, the Reserve Bank is not happy with the value of the currency as he brought up the possibility of intervention after this month’s monetary policy announcement. The RBNZ left interest rates unchanged at 1.75% and said inflation could decline further in coming quarters. Wheeler also talked about how currency intervention is always an option. Assistant Governor McDermott emphasized the significance of Wheeler’s comments by saying the RBNZ changed the NZD language to signal their unease — the first step toward possible intervention. The RBNZ opened up a can of worms and next week’s PMI services, retail sales and producer price reports probably won’t lend much support to the currency, especially after the slowdown in manufacturing PMI index. We see NZD/USD falling back to 0.7250 and possibly even 0.7200.  
Unlike the New Zealand dollar, the Australian dollar quietly drifted lower this past week as the threat of war is positive for gold and commodity prices, which is good for AUD. U.S. Treasury yields also fell more aggressively than Australian bond rates and this change in the yield spread helped to limit the slide in AUD/USD. With that in mind, the Australia

I agree with the videos that ensale shared and emanuel788 has explained that fundamentals or particular Red News only points to peak times of liquidity and momentum by the Banker/Broker Market Makers against us, the Forex retailers. Also, the notion of having The Edge as per Mark Douglas, that Davits here on his FF thread explains, is there is no guarantee on the direction ever during the major news and usually is opposite to the biased news. The above free videos on youtube regarding retail forex trading and those of Mark Douglas on youtube are worth reviewing to have the right overall mindset as a trader. And of course, the above brilliant quotes of the billionaire Warren Buffet, puts into perspective why only 5 to 10% are consistently successful and make sure you have more than one source of income!

Here is the way I would typical see a trade for a double top.  
  
Double top is formed, price breaks the last low and then pulls back to test the low. This is usually a good entry.

I dont care if they are expert or not but they are already doing it on the other threads why would they repeat it here? It will just confuse us and others unless its the same as what you are going to teach us here.

Will see how it goes. . i Know Emmanuel very well and can credit him for learning a lot about big time frames, what he shares will be helpful to this thread.. It's PA based..  
  
I will look after you, not to worry. after my first 100 pages are done I will compile the method for you. if you want to follow the full process, then try and keep up with us here day by day... 

It's in fear when people show what they truly value.

Hi ensale,  
I have been around for sometime on FF Threads here learning from many authors with their Threads and methods. You know, as others here, that you do have a very good LT approach to trading focusing on the double tops and bottoms using the higher H4 and D1 TFs..  
So, do not listen to the negative folks that spring up. You received blessings from emanual7788 himself on your new thread because he sees how you can add value in helping us, the retail Forex traders, to add a supplemental income.  
Stay strong and ignore nonsense from people that would interfere with your objectives to help the rest of us interested in trading on the H4 and Daily TFs.  
I look forward to next week working your approach.  
I do follow and trade the lower TFs on M15 and M30 using Davit's methods and attempt Cigarguy's Fast In Fast Out (FIFO) usng the M1 TF with some good results as well. But, I am interested in using the higher TFs using your approach to reduce my daily stress for my personal heath.  
So, I believe we need you to stay as long as you enjoy what you are doing and not allow your work to interfere with your health.  
Cheers !

Hi Ensale,   
  
I needed some time to study the two pdfs which you shared as well as the three videos and all the nice explanations here in this threat. Thank you for this grate stuff! It's really generous to share this with us.   
  
A few questions now: as I understood the double top or double bottom is the most important part in your strategy. So this is clear. At first: find good looking double tops/bottoms.  
  
Than it's interesting how price respects and rides sometimes the 20 sma. This helps us for entry right? So if I find a double top or bottom I have to wait until price closed over the 20 sma, than wait for the 5/20 crossover (often it happens at the same time)? This is our entry trigger isn't it? So far so easy.   
  
Than the Fibonacci tool. As I understood it would add to probability that the trade will be successful if we find double tops and bottoms at significant fibo lines right? And if we trade h4 time frame we draw the fibo from last month's high to last month's low. Where we draw the fibs for daily time frame or hourly? And which fibo levels are relevant?   
  
Than the videos about stop hunting and tend trading. As I understood it adds to the probability to our trades, if we find for example a double top on h1 after 3 big interweeks waves as well as a stop hunting after this 3 waves. So the stop hunting could be the beginning of the next 3 wave down move right?   
  
Sorry for all the questions ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) but I need to sort all the knowledge a little bit for me to understand the trading plan.   
  
Enjoy your weekend ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

the only place success comes before work is in the dictionary

Great.. We needed someone to ask these question's.. big respect to you for doing it.  
  
Q 1: as I understood the double top or double bottom is the most important part in your strategy. So this is clear. At first: find good looking double tops/bottoms.   
  
A 1: Yes number one, Is finding the best DT/DB, and even better in favourable areas. such as fib retraces etc.  
  
  
Q 2:Then it's interesting how price respects and rides sometimes the 20 sma. This helps us for entry right? So if I find a double top or bottom I have to wait until price closed over the 20 sma, than wait for the 5/20 crossover (often it happens at the same time)? This is our entry trigger isn't it?  
  
A 2: in post 87. I explained and showed an entry with the crossover, in an uptrend and then market turn this type of entry is good, as it's more conservative, whereas in a down trend, I would enter a double top before the crossover. very good question.  
  
  
Q 3: Where we draw the fibs for daily time frame or hourly? And which fibo levels are relevant?   
  
A 3: For hourly, last week high/low + plus the month if you wanted additional areas. but I would stick ... For daily trading. monthly High/low fibs as well as year high/low. ( I will address fibs in more detail soon)   
  
  
Q 4: Then the videos about stop hunting and tend trading. As I understood it adds to the probability to our trades, if we find for example a double top on h1 after 3 big interweeks waves as well as a stop hunting after this 3 waves. So the stop hunting could be the beginning of the next 3 wave down move right? 7  
  
A 4: Yes. correct. as the market is not perfect, it's dynamic but this information helps you identify manipulation. over the year's you get better at it. believe me. so the 3 waves, manipulation won't come into play on every Double top/Double bottom.. However to keep note of it and recognise it helps. Like i show below.

The double top then has a nice retrace trade but does not begin a 3 step move down. but was rather a retrace trade for the third move up on a bigger 3 wave move. however the information garnered from the video's helped you in this case and will help you as your study continues.

Hi Ensale,  
  
  
Good to see you with your own thread.  
  
I believe it is important to be aware of PRICE in accordance with Whole and Half Numbers.  
  
Banks and Institutions use them for Accumulating and Distributing their positions.  
  
Take a look at the GBP/AUD Chart with Whole and Half Numbers added and see how PRICE behaves around them  
  
Take a look at any Pair and you will see the same thing.

Hi! Correct me if I am wrong, but based on the smart money manipulation videos presented by [Ensale](https://www.forexfactory.com/ensale), we are looking for double tops/bottoms formed with stop loss hunt. So the most recent peak/trough must exceed the previous one by at least one pip (at least 3 pips, according to those three videos).

Thats my take on this too, as a scalper i am following the same understanding, what i find really interesting is the concept of price action this way, one slight disadvantage for me is i only trade two pairs euro and pound dollar as i pretty much understand their movements and style but it leaves the door open to discover other pairs would be great to see if someone has created a double top and double bottom pattern software searcher could speed the game up when searching. But hey great thread and thanks to Ensale for sure.

The stop hunt is not a must. by the way.. but something to factor in when you select your trades. 

It's in fear when people show what they truly value.

Based on what I see on your charts, you look at the most obvious W1 swing, and when price gets there, you take the entry on the lower time frame (D1) when the consolidation area is broken.

Hm, it looked like you put emphasis on the DT/DB to be at least one pip above the previous top/trough. That was my impression. Anyhow, it's a good factor, because the more reasons we have to enter a trade, the more chances we have for that trade to be a winner.

If in your study and trading you discover it add's probability or increases your confidence then use it. I will go into more detail about it soon.. why it occurs etc.. Will keep it simple for now.

Buyer's enter and have their buy stops above swing high's in anticipation of a new high, seller's that sold on the down run have their stop above their swing.. Both get twanked by the up move to the swing and above it by 1 pip then down..   
  
More examples coming soon.

This thread is great.  
Reminded me of my early days in stock trading when my instructor told me that DT/DB were powerful points, I've since forgotten this and went in search of other patterns and strategies but this is simple and will keep you out of troubles most of the time and yield some profits even if you take the conservative route and not the aggressive one.  
You're explaining it very well and in a simple way that can be followed easily.

GBPUSD showed a similar set up earlier on with the one hour chart - the trade was on but a great help was using the fibs from the low to the high over the last month - or was this a coincidence. A trade is a trade as they say. Also pretty near to a double top if you give or take the odd wick and the short hit the daily target nicely.

I believe so yes. it helps. something good trader's are able to monitor and use.

For crude bug's this was a 100 + point move. 3 point's short of our prime fib target. which is the 127.2 fib extension.

Hi Krismitt,  
  
Banks and Institution aren't looking at Random Fib. Levels to place their Orders.  
  
They use Whole and Half Numbers to do this.  
  
Take a look at any Chart and see where the Major Swings take place.

The problem when trading any level is knowing when it comes into play. so for example whole number etc. i see your point but tell me does each one come into play the same way? NO. it's how you trade price action that defines how much usefulness you get out of each level.

Hi Ensale,  
  
I completely agree with you on this.  
  
I was simply pointing out that it's not Fib. Levels that influence Price but the Price Level the Fib. falls on that is significant.   
  
How Significant Levels are Traded is down to the individual Trader.

Good Ensale yesterday i had this nagging doubt when i checked the dt on the Pound Dollar and price moved from 50 to 61.8 on the fibs i could sense a drop was on the cards for if the overall concept is to work then this DT yesterday was saying hey trains moving south and today it went lower, will it bounce of the 100 fib level well we wait and see so yep good trading.

This is a really nice thread that you have going on here, Ensale! There aren't that many here that get my attention, but this one looks great. It's a simple method. I don't usually trade the higher TF's, as I tend to be moreso the scalper, but I'm thinking of doing this too on a separate account. Well done and I look forward to being able to add my own contributions. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

The [US dollar](https://www.investing.com/quotes/us-dollar-index) so far this year has been very week, losing nearly 10% of its value. This decline might have influenced investors to go long the [euro](https://www.investing.com/currencies/eur-usd). Below looks at sentiment toward the euro, which we shared 9 days ago.  
  
  
The chart above reflects that bullish euro sentiment is historically high and in the past when it reached these levels, it was closer to a high than a low.  
Below looks at King Dollar’s pattern over the past couple of years.  
  
  
  
  
USD, while testing 2-year support, also finds itself at the apex of a bullish falling wedge, where two weeks ago at (1) a **large bullish reversal wick (reversal pattern) formed.** This support test is taking place while momentum is oversold and attempting to turn up.  
This week, King Dollar is attempting to breakout above resistance of the bullish falling wedge at (3). A rally in the USD and decline in the euro could put downward pressure on [gold](https://www.investing.com/commodities/gold), [silver](https://www.investing.com/commodities/silver) and the miners.  
Due to this pattern, members went long long the USD near the start of this month, with a stop just below the apex of the bullish falling wedge.

GU..   
  
First chart/ swing high to low on the 4hr. 23.6 retrace and then move to 127.2, no more no less. next charts we bring the month fib's and the confluences.

...  
as mentioned by our star.. dean1star, moves between 50-61.8 fib levels, which are retraces from the up move -- for those that are not aware, GU is being sold at 50% and 61.8 percent cheaper then the gains it made last month, if that explanation helps for those that are new to Fibonacci.

Also note on the above chart, we are (were, posted on this yesterday) testing the underside of the 50 % fib. normally a retrace we look for the up move however we tested the underside and didn't break above. also note we running below the 20 EMA on h4.. showing the trend is down.

This last chart highlight's The confluences and the use of two fib's being drawn. one being the monthly and the other being recent swing high and low on H4.. and reading the double top at the those important level's..  
  
So you've learned how to use the fib's for swings high's/lows + monthly levels. I will post more to cement the ideas shared.. next will post about weekly fib levels and daily for the hourly trading.   
  
  
Questions welcome

Thank you. that's nice to read (hear). would love to see your contributions.   
  
For the experienced trader's this method should help them on the long timeframes and enhance their trading.

Hi Ensale,   
  
Thanks for starting this educational thread for us. I am new to forex and always want to learn from experts like u. I will follow this thread.   
  
Sorry for my silly question. I read through the 2 PDF guides on the first post. In the H4 trading plan, I dont see u using any DT DB concept there. So may I know whether you are sharing 2 trading concepts on those 2 PDF?

It may not be mentioned but it's being used. take the information you learn from here and use it with the pdf. the trade examples may also give you 1 or 2 more setups to trade.  
  
\+ the dt/db are probable trades when used with the fib's.

Hi Ensale,  
  
Price is drawn to where ever the Pending Orders are placed who ever holds the greater Orders Wins.  
  
The speed of the Bearish move from 1.30000 BRN-1.29500 Level tells me there are more Sellers than Buyers at this Level, for now.  
  
New and existing Sell/Buy Orders will be building at this Level once more.  
  
Chances are we will see Price return to this Level for the Liquidity these Orders provide.  
  
This is as accurate as I can be for now because I don't know where the Orders are placed.

Ensale,  
  
Looks a great thread and method, thanks for sharing. As you can see by my name, I have found you from the other place!  
  
Just a question on the Moving Averages used and the indicators / template you shared.  
  
You specified 20 Simple Moving Average, assuming of the Close?  
  
The Crossover Signal indicator uses 5 EMA and 20 EMA so the signal arrows do not align with crossover of the 20 SMA  
  
So, is that on purpose or the only indicator you found at the time?  
  
For reference, check the Daily of USDCAD to see the big difference in the 20 SMA & 20 EMA  
  
Should it be changed to a 20 EMA on the charts?  
  
All the best, John

Hi.. You've brought up something quite interesting. I believe I am using the 20 ema and the correct crossover. GENIE is using the 20 sma so that's how that mixup happened. thanks for bringing it up.  
  
I would prefer if trader's just use 20 ema and the correct crossoverS.

> You know, I was just thinking about how beneficial it would be with a double top scanner for this method. For anyone that is interested, I purchased one from from a reputable website that has excellent reviews. Plus, it automatically scans up to 28 pairs on any timeframe that is specified and it will alert you on your computer and phone. Ensale, if it is okay I'll post the link here for everyone to check out. Although I have not used it for higher TF's yet since I am a scalper on the H1 and below, it's GREAT!

Okay, will do, but should be updated in the Post #1  
  
Most frustrating after 100 pages and people still asking for the settings  
  
Even in the pdf files it mentions both SMA and EMA  
  
I like EMA myself, let's get some pips

Same stuff on GU, H4, DT with stop hunt. But NU seems better, due to the fact that we have more room to the swing low.

Unemployment claims provided good numbers for the USD, which favors the two trades previously mentioned. Waiting to see more downside on GU and NU (NU DT was at important area of S/R, let's see if swing low can be hit).

Time to get out of GU, as H4 closed as a pinbar, and H1 formed an ugly morning star.

Just testing your method, buddy. Live, with small lots.  
What do you think of AN, H4? It's at the top of the rising wedge formation, but that red candle is too small for me to be convincing.

Hey Ensale, congratulations on your first thread.  
  
Nice Price Action Setups.  
  
I won't post here as I trade differently and may only add confusion.  
  
And I'm already with Sesamstrasse.  
  
This surely is a good thread with with your 5+ years experience.  
  
Best of Luck!

Okay here it is, all indicators except Moving Averages, I'm sure your MT4 has those  
  
**WARNING:** the indicator "**2) PVSRA Access Panel (Black)** " requires a certain degree of expertise with MT4. First, there is a "set" file for my settings. However, the time may be wrong in different parts of the world. Please read the instructions, we don't want Ensale's thread to become a support center, thanks.  
  
The magic of that indicator is what you can see on the 1 hour chart, Pivots, session times, round numbers, projected high & low for for daily & weekly   
  
Good luck, please Google, Youtube or PM for any problems, don't clog the thread

An update for the Template to include the 1 hour charts with MA & cross over alert & fractals

Hope you dont mind me comment ing on this Ensale?  
  
I exited my NZDUSD for loss of 9 pips simple because I did not like the short-term price-action.  
  
At the same time, I am sure the pair will fall but I was not in for the swing trade.  
  
I guess this is a call only you can make...

I do not mind, not at all.  
  
EU hit my SL, NU still struggling. The thing is that I do not mind losers, as long as the loss did not happen because I did something wrong. That is why I asked if the strategy is a set and forget one, or one in which we cut the losses. Ensale has been trading it for a while, so he must know which option is more profitable.

Set and forget on h4. manage the trade according to your experience . so use price action knowledge if it help's

What I've also noticed that trader's with more experience like erebus etc. fine this method, and have their own way to develop . nonethless the private group has given me ideas on how to keep it simple for the guys slightly less experienced..  
  
Will share in upcoming post's.

Here's a bit of an explanation on the swing failure setup (wick above the high) ... mind you the person in the video is not the inventor or originator.. just discovered and shared by him. I heard it before in this fx market.. his further development, research and the excellent explanation is why I share it here.

Nice chart, even a triple if you look back a little further, and now those points are last week's high.  
  
Now I have a suggestion for**Ensale** and others posting here, out of respect for the classical definition of Double Top & Double Bottom as defined by   
  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double..._double_bottom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_top_and_double_bottom)  
  
I suggest that the shorter term patterns detected be labelled **Double Touch**(or Triple and so on) this will cover both highs & lows, no need for top & bottom.  
  
Or we could use Double Touch Support & Double Touch Resistance  
  
Because anyone coming here later will want to argue that these are not "true" tops & bottoms in the old fashioned definition  
  
That is, the very highest & lowest turning points on a large time frame eg. weeks & months.  
  
Your thoughts, good luck to all

A question like this is usually ignored because no one can answer because there are no details or context provided.  
  
The only reason I am taking time to respond is because I recognize the "RWL" and I posted the indicator that prints that on whatever chart you seen it.  
  
**R** is for Range  
  
**W** is for Week and **D** is for Day  
  
**L** is for Low, conversely**H** is for High  
  
Not so hard is it?  
  
Basically an Average True Range that is projected from where the current High and Low are right now.  
  
These levels are dynamic with that indicator, which means they move depending on how far price is going in one direction.  
  
Once the Range is filled, the levels are fixed.  
  
If I remember, I will re-post this chart on Friday to see how the RWL and RWH looks then  
  
Good luck all

Now I have a suggestion for Ensale and others posting here, out of respect for the classical definition of Double Top & Double Bottom as defined by [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double..._double_bottom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_top_and_double_bottom) I suggest that the shorter term patterns detected be labelled Double Touch (or Triple and so on) this will cover both highs & lows, no need for top & bottom. Or we could use Double Touch Support & Double Touch Resistance...

Why do you think it had died down?  
  
For me, the main thing, actually two main things, is understanding the differences between a DT/DB in a context of HH/LL or as a continuation.  
The second thing is to be disciplined which I'm working towards achieving.  
Sometimes I place a trade thinking "That's a DT/DB" and everything goes sideways from there and reverses on me, with a small account and too many trades or a SL placed too far, it means the end of the account (again ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) )  
  
  
I will share charts when I can but we're not allowed to upload images here at work and when I'm home I have little time to do anything other than packing these days but I'll do my best.  
  
  
Anyways, thanks for the DT/DB, I completely forgot about it till now.

A quick chart before packing again.  
A trade I took this morning, it might go down some more but before it breaks the "0" line of the fib (levels are taken from another thread) I will not place another trade.  
Took some profit with fast TP and the second trade was stopped out on BE plus some pips.  
  
[EDIT]  
Thing is, this might also be a DB and price might bounce, these are the areas which I struggle with as I find myself "hoping" something or other will happen here.  
I usually lose.

300 pips and just closed 3 long positions on the EURO USD - what caught my attention was the potential DT even if on a lower time frame but also price is moving near to the 0 fibs line as set from the low to high from last month. However for sure it has the potential to break this and head north so waiting to see marios speech on Wednesday 9 am gmt (have 3 open on long positions with pound dollar looking to close tomorrow). Not much to say about the pound dollar except waiting for the 100 fibs level to be broken but the longs have proved successfull - could price take it to the 61.8 level first lets wait and see have no other info to offer but heres the chart.

was long on the EU with a buy limit order, but closed and opened in the opposite direction due to latest pa in the lower TFs.  
  
What do you think of it? sl is 1.18069 and tp will be adjusted during the day, for now it is 1.167

Uj looks nice on D1, with DB formed at previous S/R area, and if today's candle closes like this (as BUEB), it provides more confirmation. Even better, if it gets higher, it will close above the mother bar of the inside bar. That would be the best scenario.

in the next candle after te gap it entered the light green "zone". Due to the gap can one short EU and close it when?  
  
Also should you put stops in general (I know it is subjective); based on HT1? at the lower end of the light green "zone" once trade initiated?  
  
Personally, I move sl to be once the candle has closed and then trail the lowest end of the previous candle and if it's a big one the previous candle I put the sl at the half of it.

I asked for Ensale's permission to post a M15 trade which I took on Friday. Looking at H4, the price closed as a pinbar, after there was a breakout, then pullback. I like setups when price breaks and then comes back to test the area, thus resistance becoming support, and viceversa. M15 showed DB with stop hunt, and my TP of 100 pips was almost hit in the same day, and it was Friday.

I know gap closes etc. but don't worry about this one.. if you look on day chart eu has a gap not closed yet since the election's. just trade price action, trend and take profits at target's.  
  
you ask good question's. if your trading a double top, the stop is above swing high, put it in such a way that you don't get caught by another sfp.. read and watch some of the previous post's to understand.

EJ trade from Friday, TP hit. Draghi's speach helped. Many times the technical signals foretell the outcome of the fundies. This was one of those times.

I took a EC trade on H1, based on breakout/pullback/continuation. It broke out the last swing high, returned to test it, and then went back to the presumed direction, after DB with stop hunt (my favorite) at 23.6 retracement on W1. I closed the trade once I had a H1 close under the last swing low, but then reentered after H1 BUOB. Target was D1 127.2 extension, although it is deleted from the chart.

OK .. For simplicity sake.  
  
Going forward. have learned a lot from having the small group. since Fibonacci is a challenge to start with .. such as where do i draw the fib, do I use weekly, monthly etc. when do I use recent swing H/low.. question's like this can be eliminated by guiding you folk to only using one fib draw.. and that's from Previous day High and low, for all trading including 4HR.  
  
EUR/JPY example below. Each vertical represent's a new day.  
  
and for whatever trade trader's take. I suggest for them the 127.2 target. short side or long side. This approach is preferred for H1. But for 4HR trader's for now this is how I would like you to approach it.

So for now we don't need to draw fibs, we can use the indicator and aim for HT1 or LT1?

TP hit on EA. Testing the D1 TL and LWH, DB with stop hunt, shoots up after morning star.

Hi Catalin,  
  
I see the 1.50000 BRN Transitioning from Selling to Buying.   
  
Once all the Sell Orders have been consumed, at 1.50000, Buyers take their place and Price moves higher to find the next Level Selling.  
  
It's not necessarily a Stop Hunt.  
  
You are more likely to see a Stop Hunt Sweep a Double Top or Bottom because of the additional Stops placed there.

So where doeas the price is going? Does it going up on the next BRN above? or below? for sure it goes both so you are right when the chart history is finished.

Hi Mario,  
  
This would have been one of the easier ones.  
  
After the Bullish Transition Candle Breaks through 1.50000 BRN you could be certain of seeing a Test of this Level.  
  
Now there are a lot of Sell Stops sitting below 1.50000 BRN once they are Triggered (today) and Consumed the Market moves up once more.

I have no idea where Price is going.  
  
The Institutions/Banks with the most Orders, either Long or Short, Consumes the Opposition and moves to the next Level of Liquidity for them to feed off.  
  
I have tried to Trade this way with some small success but the Institutions make it difficult for us to know where their Levels are.   
  
These days I tend to Trade all the Significant Levels.

Hi Bistolis,  
  
We need to understand how Price gets moved by those who have the Money to do so.  
  
When Price has a Bullish Bias we will see Price get "run up" "they" then take some off (Profit) and "they" then Buy it back at a Lower Price.   
  
They keep doing this until they have no more to Buy, at this point they Sell everything and start to work Price into a Bearish Bias.  
  
We will now see Price get "run down" they will then take some off (Profit) and they then Sell it back at a Higher Price.  
  
They keep doing this until they have no more to Sell, at this point they Buy everything and start to work Price into a Bullish Bias.  
  
Along the way, of course, there are various Manipulations taking place to throw us of the scent.  
  
The clues, we have, are in where previous Transactions have taken place.  
  
Often Buying will Transition into Selling and Selling Transition into Buying.  
  
So its these Level where we need to be Anticipating being able to take Trades.  
  
A lot of the time we see significant Buying and Selling occurring at Whole and Half Numbers.

Hi,  
  
Please, where can I learn to read the price like you just did with H1 EURGBP?

Thank you for that video!  
I've also just read some of the .pdf's over at PVSRA. The video's certainly cleared some stuff.  
Are there any interesting threads besides PVSRA? Or maybe books, more videos?  
  
Also, I apologise for cluttering this thread with questions not so related to the initial concept, but I was not able to find any PM's or something like that (I'm new to FF). However, I think that this might not be that much of an issue as I believe that such chart reading could improve any style of trading.

Hi Everyone.  
  
I very much regret I did not notice this thread in the beginning, but I like to trade the 4hr charts, and simple strategy's. Thank you ensale! I am only about half way thru this thread, but I have just been shorting the AUD/NZD on my old stradegy, and noticed this looks like a good setup on both the 4hr and Daily for the BTS. The Sea Green & Tomato arrows are the 5 ema crosses of the Yellow 20 ema line. I very much appreciate what has been shared so far, and have subscribed to this thread. I hope I am not out of line posting these charts. What do you guys think?  
Thanks in advance!  
  
Andy.

From what I can see here, you were enjoying the the thread and even learning a thing or two.  
  
How easy is it to say your piece and run off like a coward... You could have at least stood up like a man and defend your argument before running off into the sunset.

Geez, man! I do not know you, I do not know how good you are as a trader, but speaking about Ensale like this is not cool at all. He is one of the nicest, helpful and honest traders I've known. I am not looking for a fight with you or with anyone else on this forum, but I just had to speak my mind, especially because I interacted with him almost on a daily basis for the past two years, and I really know what kind of person he is.

I've no hard feeling's towards dean. let's leave it at that. I am sure he will come around..   
  
if the stuff i shared is not for you then fine.. to clarify to other's i make clear (in this thread) i learned from other's and shared, everyone learns from someone. but the person dean mention's is just one that I've had the pleasure of picking up gems from.  
  
I think in this thread, there are more then enough pieces together for someone to have a method to trade or put a jigsaw together.. lastly the reason i limited the group to 20 or so.. is one I knew there would be dropout's secondly, the time, I and the folks with me cannot handle more then 20. better quality then quantity..

yup..  
  
edit.. fibs yes, when we started this thread the focus was 4hr day charts.. adapting to markets has led to 30 min trading specifcally being the focus although 4 hr swing setups are still taken...  
  
tommorow i will list what im looking for from the trader's who want to come on board..

Recently we had 1/2 traders who broke records, i reliase it worked for him well, and it a chance to open it for others, it won't work for everybody , but it's well worth trying. the system offers a framework, simplicity and strength in spotting visual setup's and ofcourse experience/effort is the difference.  
  
The people that do well, put the time in. and follow the step's,  
  
I hope you are the next success story ..

here's what im looking for from particapant's   
  
1\. to be able to get on with people and work well with other's .  
  
2\. have one session (asia , london , US ) that they are able to trade, atleast 2/3 times a week. if there is a few that can trade asia and london your progress will be faster.  
  
3\. give yourself 3-6 month's to see if it suits you, within a week you'll see weather it's worth that, but practice of 3/6 months will reveal weather its has good potential for you, usually within this period trader will see some decent results , (inconsistent ) to carry on further then that.  
  
4\. lastly clean or cleaner mind, trader's that have attempted 10 different stratagies will have too much to unlearn or will mix approaches, we are looking for trader's that are 1/2 years in , perhaps have traded 2/3 basic strategies in the past.  
  
Goal is to not waste my time or your time... simple..  
  
wish you the best of luck

example trade.. we trade to target's previously set.. we find entries in trending market that give us good Risk to reward... more to it then this ofcourse.. but this is shown in the simplest form.

Hi Ensale,  
  
I would appreciate if you could provide more details about the SHORTNAMES that you have used for the various levels ( what does DM, IRL, etc stand for ) marked on the chart and then start explanations so that it is easier to follow what you mean when you actually explain.  
  
Thanks

Hello Everyone and welcome to everyone that is passing by and looking..  
I joined this thread back in August 2017 and proud to say that I am still here and still learning.. It never stops really ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f642.png?v=15.1)  
  
Just wanted to share my thoughts based on what I have learnt from Ensale and Genie.  
First off, I cant thank them enough for showing me the way and improving my trading skills. I joined FF back in 2015, but have never posted much. Just read through many of the threads trying to absorb and figure this game out. The only system I ever tried was Dove's Paradox system.. I was even taken to his private training group to learn.. Unfortunately couldn't really make it work consistently for me. The second group I joined was here, when Ensale first started the thread. I sent him a PM and asked to join and the rest is history.. What a journey it has been with ups and its fair share of downs. Trying to keep it short, what I have learnt is nothing less than amazing. Having said that, be prepared to put the work and effort in and I am sure some of you will also see and learn some eye opening stuff.  
  
If anyone has any questions, just shout.. Cheers

DM stands for middle of the range off previous day, IRL and irh, is 38.2 and 61.8 of previous day range..   
  
Hope this helps

OK, so I'm to explain core concepts that encover the whole FIBO/price action trading approach. What we try to practice and instill.  
  
1- Trend continution trades to probable consistent target. ( with price action )   
  
2- Trend continution to probable targets from deeper retracements.   
  
3- trading double tops/bottoms / trading retracements  
  
4- trading sfp, and some understanding of typical market trapping behaviours and tendencies.   
  
5- Trading 1.12 fib failure   
  
6- Trading to further targets once prime target is achieved  
  
  
mindset and risk  
  
1- self drive and seld reliance   
  
2- Proper riskM and mindset.   
  
3\. developing and research approach . always learning   
  
  
some challenges most will face -   
  
work trade and life balance, understanding and applying core concepts, finding their timeframe and approach . each trader will have to figure some aspects for themselves.

One example of one of the setup's

above example of 1.12 failure fib trade, so the trend fails to continue long and hit new areas (targets..) after several hit's its turns and breaks below the 20 ema, the entry is the red arrow, marked on the crossover of 20 ema (advanced trader's make a different entry)  
  
for this trade target is inside of previous day's action , 61.8 retrace is the conservative target typically.

Here's a retracement early today and then a push up to reach the 127 fib. I missed the double/triple bottom at the 38% fib so a late entry for me but a safe trade. Didn't have time to monitor the trade so closed out early with a nice profit. But as you can see it tried real hard to get to the 127 fib.

GU made it to the 141% fib today, would have been a real nice trade if you could have gotten in around the 38% retracement and held on into the London open.
