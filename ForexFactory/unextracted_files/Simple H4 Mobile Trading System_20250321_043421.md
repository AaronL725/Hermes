I started a thread in Journal Forum to share about this strategy as I am still testing. The results are promising so I decided to share here.  
  
Do note I only started it for 1 month and the results not enough to conclude anything. Some have tried and so positive results too. Visit here to rea din details: [https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...7#post11550457](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=11550457#post11550457)  
  
Too many trader focus on reward to risk (RR). However that is their hypothesis if the price action (PA) reach to the level they want. However, often then not the PA do not reach to the level they want and hit SL  
  
I asked myself how to become a consistent profitable trader? So i concluded that the win to loss ratio is more important. Definitely money management is the basis.  
  
All you need for this strategy is your phone. I only trade on all USD, EUR, GBP and JPY pairs  
  
***Background***  
I spent abt 10k learning forex last year June from someone once i reckon as “mentor” whereby later i know i can get the same knowledge for free on babypips.  
  
Lost another 10k using what he taught me and strategy hopping on FF. He has decades of Fx trading experience and within the same year he lost 40k out of 50k of my mum’s fund. That shows he is just some incapable trader(scammer).  
  
However, I’m not someone who give up easily. So based of these lesson learnt and my knowledge, i came out with this. No point blaming others and be a cry baby. The money wont be back.  
  
Not completely my strategy but I hope it does work so i can repay my mum’s fund. If you interested feel free to try, if it doesnt suit your style, you can skip the thread. No one will force you to try, so dont type unnessary comment.

Rules  
1\. Add EMA 30 to chart  
2\. Follow the trend  
3\. Long at next open bar when Bullish Engulf bar is formed above EMA30, and short at next open bar when Bearish Enguld bar is formed below EMA 30.  
4\. Use Finbonacci to determine SL and TP  
  
Notes:  
\- I dont need people to tell me what to do. I am not a new trader, I know what I am doing.  
\- Please read title and simple rules clearly. If not ask politely.  
\- This strategy is meant to show trading is possible using JUST phone and still profitable.  
\- I dont need people to develop EA or indicators for me. You want to do for your own purpose feel free to do so.  
\- If u cant understand pictures better than words, I have nothing more to say.  
\- If you want to make things complicated (improvised the strategy), please create your own new threads  
\- I like to keep things real simple  
\- Feel free to post graph, ask question and share your results  
  
  
***Test at your own risk***  
This strategy is still at testing period as I have only started for the first month. I will use purely only this strategy to trade for a year and see how it goes. As a result looks promising, that is why I start this thread so those who are interested. Period.  
  
I know there are a lot more experienced traders out there. But please be humble and stay open-minded.

This looks like a very efficient strategy, after all, Engulfing candles always proved to work good in determined situation.  
If i can give you an advice, i'll suggest you to set multiple targets (at least 2 targets total): 1st target at 200% and then you let your order run to the 2nd target (maybe till it reaches a major supply/demand level or till it reaches an opposite engulfing candle). This way you will be able to maximize your profits even more!

**Which bar is the current bar?**

  1. The ENGULFING bar
  2. The close of the bar after the ENGULFING bar?

WHAT ARE THE PREFFERED TIMEFRAMES USED TO TRADE?**JUST H4?**  
  
AN **ALERT** IS BEST FOR THIS SYSTEM TO WORK, YOU NEED AN INDICATOR TO SEND ALERTS as push NOTIFICATIONS TO YOUR PHONE ONCE ALL CONDITIONS ARE MET. This push notification would also state the tp zones 1, 2 etc.  
  
**_CODERS INTEREST_** -STATE THE RULES PROPERLY SO THAT WHOEVER IS INTERESTED IN CODING AN INDICATOR OR E.A. HAS THE RELEVANT INFORMATION.   
  
(**P****ersonally**) I would prefer to close a part of the trade at the different take profit or **r:r** zones since you incorporated fibonacci as a money management tool and let the rest be trailed. These same candle pattern trades can last for long runs at times and maybe able to cover for any losses that may come along the way, especially as a free trade at that point.  
  
**Risk to reward (R:R)** is needed for the strategy as it regards to the longevity of the method. R:R would state **how many wins would be required** to stay in the market. Without r:r there is no confidence when losing streaks come along. Since I'm sure not all setups will win.  
_**Winrate and risk to reward goes hand in hand.**_  
  
**Any additional RULES that might have been overlooked?** This would cover thing's like when you would not take a trade.

  1. Do you trade around news expectations?
  2. Is there any provision for retracement entries like 50% of the ENGULFING bar?
  3. WHAT of it forms through the moving average line?
  4. What have you not mentioned yet, don't wait until too far to state these things.

**Keep up the good work! Candle patterns can be very rewarding once done in a systematic way.**  
_N.B. State your rules properly so they are not misinterpreted_.

I don't know probably someone can look at this e.a. and modify it or use a piece of the code. These pictures identify a bullish and bearish ENGULFING bar to help coders to code your method.  
The e.a. I believe uses candle size as a criteria.

Another trade closed at TP. I know some conservative traders prefer to set stop order at the high and low after the bar is closed. You can still do so if it suits you.  
  
However, I prefer to open trade at the next open bar as I am using phone to trade, it will be v messy if i open a lot of stop order and confuse myself.   
  
You can test it H4 and higher timeframes, whichever suits your style. I dont do it on Daily TF because open bar for me is 5am and I have tried before, I am still in sleep mode even if i set alarm (ofteni just turn off my alarm and sleep). I prefer my sleep ya. So after testing many TF, H4 works for me.

Posting a picture may help significantly...

  1. Is the Bollinger band the default settings?
  2. Does the ENGULFING bar touch the Bollinger band?

The use of daily and weekly makes it more potent.☺

Yes, BB default setting. The picture is running currently trade. My strategy is for long term trading. I will give it a try strategy from hsz10. Maybe can combine the system and make it perfect. Take profit will be 50% or 61.80%. Some trade can even go more than 100% and above. need to check with weekly timeframe

She plots her fibs on the ENGULFING bar though, that's a difference I see so far.  
Now the challenge for me is that based on what I read in the journal it seem as though the ENGULFING bar can be the same colour as well ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1), things got interesting right there for me. I would do opposite colours only. Like if I am taking a sell the previous bar that is being engulf would have to be bullish and the ENGULFING bar is bearish. That would be my main rule apart from the obvious ema 30. The Bollinger band could show exhaustion?  
  
I prefer e.a.'s they make no mistakes and have no discretion when making decisions it is the fixed rules that apply for entry, trade modifications and exits no discretionary factors.

I did go through the images of the entries and I can see that she define the engulfing pattern to be that the entry candle high/low engulf the high/low of previous bar. She doesn't care so much about the color to the body. So what she call engulfing bar is what we usually call outside bar. Engulfing bar is usually defined such that the body of (open/close) entry bar engulf the body (open/ close) of previous bar.  
  
About the strategy: It looks nice but it's to short time to know that it will work in the long run.

With the engulfing pattern it's the body (open/close) that counts. It doesn't care about the high/low(wick). So OP trading outside bar. But outside bar can also be engulfing bar if body of the last bar cover (engulf) the body of the candle before the last bar.

There is no no, contact information, or any sort of reference i see on it.  
I like the lie currency strength meter very much, it says 'live' obviously, but does it auto re-fresh on its own, or do we have to refresh our webpage to get the updated percentage?

Nothing to shame of. I wouldnt make FX a chore to me. Besides, the spread is higher for daily open bar, so it doesnt make sense to me.

I was surprised to see this thread. Because I apply almost the same strategy. The only difference is that I use 21 EMA instead of 30 EMA. I also use price action strategies. I'm gonna follow your thread friend.  
  
This was traded last week with 1 lot after B.Engulfing candle emerged. It closed at TP level with 100 pips.

A Suggestion  
  
If it happens, it can be sold with the right SL.

good suggestion but this is not the candle suggested by @hzs10 coz current candle not completly engulfing previous candle but right suggestion if this is the candle to trade to trade to sell at .618 retracement

Interesting. I also trade with my mobile phone only. and for this kind of trade, one needs an exact clue of entry and exit signal. without any complication, trade what you see. Keep on going. wish you all the best.

Hi Hzs10,  
Nice simple plan. Comment on my analysis? As I may perceive engulfing candles differently. Would you take the trade at #7 & #8 ? I drilled down into the 1H to determine SL movement to achieve results as close as possible regarding this exercise.  
Cheers, Axleman.

Hit the center of the screen then select where the arrow points. There after scroll until you see fibonacci section.  
  
This way is for android, for Apple there might be another way not sure.

This my engulf definition. I focus more on high low. The body sometimes may be not as perfect. But high and low of current bar need to create a higher high and lower low than previous bar

Wow! This strategy is just perfect. Simple and very effective. Thank you for sharing hxs10!  
  
I hope we can keep this thread going and share results over a period of say 3 months.  
  
This is how it looks for me at the moment.

Mobile device MT is less powerfull.  
Using virtual desktop and remoting it from mobile, it will be more efficient, and you can use more indices it means more technique.  
Nice thread, i can share my trick you guys. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Have tried this, but there is some lag to deal with also a little hard controlling the mouse cursor.  
  
which Remote Desktop have you used?  
i used the chrome Remote Desktop and just found the mouse cursor lagging and a pain..  
  
The simplicity of this system doesn’t require much for the mobile app anyway..

Good on you. KISS always rules.  
  
I can tell you now that imo you will be well pleased at the end of your year, I've used many variants on this over a whole lot of years.  
  
Also, good on you for finding a way to trade on your phone - I tried it a couple of times, once by choice, once by necessity, both times near drove me nuts, lol.

Is difficult on the Phone thats for sure!!!  
  
Just doesn't feel the same not being able to flip through the charts as quickly  
  
And it would be nice to be able to setup an auto BE level atleast or an alert just on the App

All you would need is the EA to open the trades for you and then fairly easy to manage them yourself

These results (for those who didn't read the journal thread) are opened at the high/low of engulfing candle and TP is 150 fib. Daily charts  
  
Here is an updated list ( I would suggest trading with pairs 65% or more)  
Concerning my earlier post regarding the fact that if an additional setup occurs during a trade of the same direction you can double (or more) the position size...Over 100s of trades across several pairs I have seen only 2 that did not work out.

So we are basically talking about 3 different systems here... Yes?  
  
Op =  
1.30ema/on H4 chart  
2\. Follow trend ( so if price is above the ema we are only placing buys, and if price is below the ema- we are only placing sells)  
3\. We are basically looking for a outside bar..Most recent closed bar has a high, higher then the prev closed bars high and a low, lower then the prev bars low.  
4\. Place trade according to trend of 30ema/price...  
(We can place a sell even if the candle on the most recent bar is green but we are under the 30ema)  
example =[https://www.forexfactory.com/attachm...1&d=1538640240](https://www.forexfactory.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=3023461&d=1538640240)  
5\. We open the trade at the Open of the candle after the outside bar is formed.  
(OPs rules = 3._Long at next open bar_ when Bullish Engulf bar is formed above EMA30, and _short at next open bar_ when Bearish Enguld bar is formed below EMA 30.)  
5\. We TP @ 200 fibo (which is 1-1 r/r. So the size of the outside candle(most recent closed) is the size we are going for tp.)  
6\. SL=the high of outside bar(if a sell) or the Low of the outside bar if a buy.  
  
syedtaimur is using the same as op but a different entry  
1\. 30ema/H4 chart  
2\. Outside bar is formed.  
3 take buy trade when the high of the outside bars candle is broken by currently open candle  
or Sell when we break the low of the outside bars candle is broken  
(both depending on relation to ema and price)  
4\. take tp at 1/1 of size of outside bar(200fib).(move to break even When at 150fib or .5 of original outside bar size)  
  
  
cfudge  
1\. 30ema/day chart(not 4hr like op)  
2\. (for a buy) price above ema/last closed candle is a outside bar.. We take trade @ break of high of prev bar(outside bars high)..  
(for sell) price below ema/last closed candle is a outside bar... We take trade @ break of low of prev bar(outside bars low)..  
3 we tp trade @ 150fib or .5 the size of the orginal outside bars size..  
4 we SL trade @ 0 fib (for sell its the high of the outside signal bar, for buy its the low of outside signal bar)  
  
  
scratching head--just not sure what the system is here..

> Hmmm Ok im a bit confused.. Seems like there are 3 methods going on here.. Op = 1.30ema/on H4 chart 2. Follow trend ( so if price is above the ema we are only placing buys, and if price is below the ema- we are only placing sells) 3. We are basically looking for a outside bar..Most recent closed bar has a high, higher then the prev closed bars high and a low, lower then the prev bars low. 4. Place trade according to trend of 30ema/price... (We can place a sell even if the candle on the most recent bar is green but we are under the 30ema) example...

I just compared the entry directly after engulfing candle against waiting when the high/low of the bull/bear candle was reached...THIS makes the strategy more profitable sometime it is the key to this...USDJPY:

Yeerrrrrr traders you are given a simple simple profitable strategy and you exhaust your energy making sure you ruin it by adding all colours of roses that will do nothing but complicate your decision making, not sure whether people are lazy or what and expect cooked meals on a tray. A BIG FAT NO COOK THE FOOD YOURSELF AND EAT  
  
This strategy works well all you need is visit your charts every 4 hours and check . that wont take you more than 15 mins. it is that simple. YES NOT ALL WILL PROFITABLE, ACCEPT AND MOVE ON IT IS PART OF THE GAME  
  
My only advise is learn to draw the structure that is support and resistance on D1 chart and trade your H4 also using your D1 moving average as your dynaic support/ resistance because candles may be above MA on H4 but below on D1, so always check first where they are on D1 or if there is enough room between D1 MA and candles

U cant get perfect engulf always. I sold this on NU bc of other factor as well. I took a sell on weekly candle which show strong bearish. So that 2 trades closed with profit.   
  
But to prevent any confusion just follow definition of the engulf. Basic rule before taking a trade, if you are unsure, dont take the trade. There will always be a trade opportunity in the market.

Hi reteid2222  
I used the indicator I posted on the journal thread and took every trade I saw. If the trade never opened I did not count it.

Would love to see what happens with Pending entry Order at 50% Retracement of Engulfing Bar.

Thanks.

Hi hzs10,  
  
Nice and simple strategy. I'm also fan of KISS systems. Can you tell us how do you manage those trades on mobile phone? You can't have any EA attached, so how do you move your trades to BE?

So are you the person who do something only if gets something back? If some people are unpolite that doesn’t mean you have too.

Hi hzs 10 and all,  
  
Thanks for the simple strategy.  
  
I have never used mobile mt4 for trading. I know how to draw Fibo but I cannot get 150 level and 200 level and having line at the levels. Can you please tell me how to set that?

You didn't get my point. If your trade reaches 150, you basically don't know until you go and manually check. Then you can manually set the trade to BE.  
On my PC mt4 platform I have simple EA attached, so it monitors the trade and set it to BE as soon as it reaches 150.

It is easy to check every now and then on mobile. It doesnt take more than a min. I dont see why it is so hard. If it is hard for you then stick to your EA. Since we are using H4 TF price wont move as fast as you thought. When price really move that fast it often hit TP. We are not doing scalping, so 150 is not a price that hit like doing scalping. You can dont even look at 150. So is either hit SL or TP.

As long as the trades are being done in the simple way this thread was designed for the process to be, all is Well. Should one find consistency it must be through simplicity and not a world of inputs that vary from the original concept, introducing complications.  
  
Obviously it is working for those participating, those who are traders and observing from a distance should get involved, ask your questions, State your concerns or ideas according to the rules of the system and let trading this method remain easy.   
  
Having an e.a. can be nice but would not reflect the idea of the thread in the first place seeing that it was meant to be mobile trading=manual trading.  
H4, daily, weekly are great timeframes for those who do other things other than trading during the day. All it takes is some minutes to scroll through the different assets you have on your list and be done.  
  
The only thing that could help as I have said is an alert and which could state the parameters for the trader to put in on their mobile device. There have been indicators posted here or the other threads the OP has, whether as trading journal or system strategy. Set it on a vps whether paid or free, activate the push notifications if any and wait for the sound that's it. This time each four hour that your phone chirps means a possibility of earning.  
ALL THE BEST! TRADE SAFE.

At "hzs10"  
  
i'm still confuse about your definition of engulfing. the high and low of the current candle must be higher and lower than the previous candle. How about the body and the colour of the current candle? does it have to be closed bullish above ma and bearish below ma? does it have to be bigger than the previous body? or is it the high and low that matter?  
  
Thanks....

I'm not hzs10, but... Try to start with strict definition of engulfing: current high > previous high, current low < previous low, bars are different bullish/bearish, currend body bigger than previous. Current bullish over EMA30 - buy, current bearish below EMA30 - sell.

Nice post princej58  
I agree ...keep it simple.  
I have 1 indicator only, it shows the engulf candle.  
As far as an EA, I don't think it is a good idea. I have several tweaks that I use that may not be applicable in an EA, such as, if a candle closes more than halfway to 150 I close the trade, if a candle closes above/below the SL of an unopened trade I will cancel the trade and if I have an active trade open and a opposite signal appears but does not reach the SL I will close the trade.

Is this good enough for Sell, considering the signal candle just broke the EMA?

It takes a minute to check one pair. Would be great to use more pairs. What can one use to switch pairs quickly? 

Buy low, sell high.

Maybe you can post wih a graph instead of i keep posting graph. That way mayb you can learn faster. I have post a theoretic “perfect” engulf image. If u cant analyse a graph then follow the simple rule that I have stated in the first post. There are trading opportunities every day. If you cant even find a graph then no matter how i tell u my definition you will never find one yourself. So spot one and i will tell you.

Hi hzs10,  
  
Do you place the trade after the current bar crosses bottom/high of the engulfing bar or just at the opening of the new candle after engulfing and hoping it would go towards the profit? Do you also pay attention to the color of the current bar (opposite or same color as the engulfing bar)?

For those keep asking abt “perfect” engulf pattern. Please check the engulf image i have shared. If you are keep confusing abt this strategy please read first post over and over again.  
  
If you dont want to risk your money, open a demo acc to test the strategy. You wont learn by just asking qns.  
  
Please look at AUDJPY. There are 3 recent “perfect” engulf pattern that you can take. With 1 stoping out and 2 closing with profits.

do you close your trades on the next h4, or leave it open until you hit your TP?

hi cyguy,  
  
controlling the trade position while in profit will be always defend on you...  
as rules of hzs10, once reach 150 mark she moved SL on 100 as BE with profit, or you can just take TP 150...  
but eventually it always hit 200 TP...

Hi there hzs10:  
  
Your system is very simple and very clear.  
  
Will assist many of your subscribers, and I dare say most of us, to trade our way out of the 95% and into the 5% ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Thank you for sharing and for being honest with your experience.  
  
Regards,  
Krismitt.

Sorry, i am not the right person to approach to ask for broker bc i didn experience with many. The one I am using now is recommended by my previous “mentor” but I suspect he is one of those who work with them. The reason I am still using it now bc I did manage to withdraw the money out and like u i didn know any good one out there. Mayb u can ask around you who do trading for advise

Nice work by hzs10. Le's see how results turn in.  
  
The AUDUSD looks like a nice trade, even though prices are still rising. Let's see if it plays out successfully.

I wouldnt take this trade. Strong bullish bar follow by pinbar pushing towards upwards. If the body close towards the lower end, then i would take the trade

Depends how many currency pairs you are looking. If you looking at all pairs, then u can easily get more than 5 pairs. Sometime a single currency can get more than one entry. Look at AUDJPY for recent examples. Sometime u dont get any like today. No entry for me at all for today

Please dont just follow engulf blindly. I would recommend to study how to read price action. Although I only got 1 year plus experience, I have trained to read many charts for the past one year. Bc under my previous “mentor” apprentice, I am needed to analyse one chart every day. So I trained to look chart v fast.   
  
I have helped him to do “free” analysis on his web for almost 6months everyday last year. I think that is the only thing i benefit. However he did not teach me how to read price action. I took effort to research online and study myself.

What are some situations where you have seen this strategy move against you? The rule set seems exceedingly easy to automate, so I'm wondering if there is a more 'softer' skill required to analyzing an entry point.

Would normally be a good trade, but I won't take it because I also filter my trades with this important rule below:  
  
I'm always skeptical when the MA (in this case EMA 30) is flat. I have more confidence when the MA is sloping upwards for buy trades, or sloping downwards for sell trades.

What's about this type of setup?  
The candle is bullish but below EMA 30.  
  
{I took this trade just for testing purpose, need your reviews)

Dear this is not the setup Rules can’t be simple then that plot a 30ema if u got a bullish engulfing upper then 30 ema trade it if you got a bearish engulfing lower then 30 ema go ahead green signal. Simple   
if you got an engulfing candle rules fulfilled but previous candle have strong momentum to the opposite side then definitely it is a setup according to rules but not a high quality setup its up to you trade it or leave it but the suggestion is leave it the market is full of opportunities move to next setup.  
My 2 cents

Hello all,  
  
Trading with candle patterns on the H4 chart is HIGHLY broker-dependent.  
  
If you think about it, the HOURLY chart is identical for everyone around the world as the hour changes at exactly the same time everywhere. Likewise the WEEKLY is identical.  
  
The problem comes with the H4 and the DAILY. Depending on your broker's "GMT Offset" you will see radically different shapes of candles, because the DAY and H4 bar changes at different times for different brokers.  
  
Personally, I only use a broker with a GMT+2 offset. Because the FX markets are open 10pm Sunday to 10pm Friday (UK time) then a GMT+2 broker will give you precisely 5 daily candles per week - without the silly pesky little "Sunday candle" which doesn't mean anything. Likewise, you will get precisely 30 4-hour candles.  
  
Any other broker offset will mean that your candles are closing at hours between my 4-hour intervals and so your candle shapes will be different.  
  
When looking for Inside/Outside bars this can make a HUGE difference ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f600.png?v=15.1)  
  
Good trading and best wishes to all,  
  
**OD**

I suggest all using Tradingview.com ([FXCM](/brokers/fxcm "View FXCM Broker Profile")) chart for all pairs. It is the most accurate one.

Hi hzs,  
Good strategy you got here. thanks a lot, i backtested it and it has been very promising so far.  
  
Now that you say dont follow engulf blindly, what are the other things that you consider beside the engulfing?  
Consolidation is one thing for sure i guess.  
What about S/R? How much S/R effects your decision?  
Do you look at higher TF trends or anything else?  
  
Anyway, I took a trade on EURJPY just now. what do you think?

One more question,  
Do you add wriggle room to your SL? If yes, how many pips would you recommend?  
  
Thanks

I dont think this one is engulfing candle.  
  
from what i learnt from other source, the pattern we are looking for in this method is called "outside bar/candle". And engulfing is when the wick of previous candle is not enclosed within the bigger/next candle.  
Its just a matter of names, though.

Just curious "OP" i need clarification with the signals and possible trades on this EURJPY chart. They are identified with arrows. 1 chart with blue arrows only and the other with mixed colours so you can identify them separately.  
  
  
There is one in the second picture which is running equal to the moving average (green arrow), in this case would you take setups which are neither above or below the moving average but more so equal to the moving average? Or does the bar just need to close below the moving average?

I look at how the candle close, i dont look at SR bc you can always break that range. Ema pointing up, down or flat. Since what ur backtest looks promising then follow how you would look for a setup in backtest. I do look at higher TF sometimes but i dont use it to confirm my entry. SL,TP follow Fibo

By naked eye i know the black arrow the low is not lower low. The rest is correct

What would be good is to just summarize as we go along on the first post the rules and different setups.

Incredibly simple yet profitable. As it has been already mentioned "learn price and follow the trend" as these are your friends in any market.   
Great to see traders learning to trade profitably

They are identified with arrows. 1 chart with blue arrows only and the other with mixed colours so you can identify them separately. There is one in the second picture which is running equal to the moving average (green arrow), in this case would you take setups which are neither above or below the moving average but more so equal to the moving average? Or does the bar just need to close below the moving average? {image} {image}

The EJ short is already running over 50 pips. Nice trade.

Although the current 4HR candle has not ended, this is setting up to be a good trade.  
  
Check 1. Very good outside bar candle (although not yet closed)  
Check 2. EMA 30 sloping downward.  
Check 3. A lot of room to the downside.  
  
My only worry: looking to the left, there's a horizontal support.  
  
However, I'll take this trade after current candle closes.  
  
**Edit: The horizontal support has been poked through. Coast is clear for this trade after candle close.**

Yes. I may skip the trade or wait for retracement before entering because looks like the current candle is going straight to the bottom. I cannot enter if the 4hr candle is over stretched,

Good to know, I also see just trying to confirm some genuine concerns. Not stepping on any toes or anything. This method can either be very stricked or the user can exercise some discretion. To each one using choose there road at their risk and comfort.

Just edit the indi any way you want it. I agree, it makes a big difference when you customise the fibs to fit the method you are using it on, rather than the generic version.

Looks like an interesting strategy, gonna back test it. One thing i dont understand is using a fixed lot size, is there a reason for this instead of having each trade worth the same percentage risk?

I am using the same percentage per trade and HZS10 uses fixed, It will be interesting to see if one is better for returns.  
The problem with fixed percent is that your RR is always lower than 1:1 so you rely on this method producing many more wins than losses, which backtesting shows to be the case.  
The problem with fixed position size and using BE and targeting 200 fib is smaller win rate and larger candles can eat up a large chunk of your profits if SL hit.

Keeping all the parameters the same across all pairs are able to give the accurate final profitable % of this strategy.  
  
Critical thinking: Do you do that for backtest? Do you skip setup on Friday when doing backtest? Do you check important news and skip setup when doing backtest? If not, then why do you do that for forward testing? If you do that for backtest, then fair enough you can do that for forward testing.   
  
The true is how many make that extra effort to do that when doing backtest?

Dear hzs10,  
  
Can you please help me understand your money management. I gather you use Fibo and that when the price reaches 150 you move the SL to 100. Where do you start in the first place? Pictures are welcome.  
  
Thank you!

Pretty easy to understand, objective and no double guessing. Would you please tell us what broker you’re using? Sometimes broker data varies and CSs may look different. Below I attached screenshots of [IronFX](/brokers/ironfx "View IronFX Broker Profile"), Tradersway and TheTradersDomain, you can see there is quite a difference on what looks to be an engulfing CS.

Yes I trade live as I traded on the backtests.   
Just to re-cap, I take every signal, I set pending orders at the high or low of the engulf candle and set SL at high/low and TP is 150fib, I do not care about any directional bias, I use a fixed position size on all trades, if a trade has not triggered and a candle closes beyond SL I cancel trade, if a trade is active and an opposite signal shows up but does not hit SL I close with a small loss, if a trade is open and I get a close beyond 1/2 way to 150fib I close and finally if a second signal of the same direction shows up during an active trade I will open a second trade at twice the position size.  
The backtest results show the high win rate I feel is needed to trade this way...

Here is an example of how I bactested this  
The only remaining question, as I have stated previously, is how the profit to loss ratio will turn out, which I am live testing now.

Tried to make manual backtest of EURUSD 4H GMT+2 according to original rules ( BE at 150 Fibo, TP at 200) using OGT Price indi with Cfudge settings from Jan 2016 to Oct 2018, seems like this pair is not profitable. Could be interesting if someone would make such backtest also. Probably JPY pairs are the best for this strategy in the long run.

Guys, you are talking about backtesting. Great.  
  
What you will find out? That one pair was 80% successful so you are going to trade it? I can backtest 100 strategies and they will be all successful. You know why?  
  
Because, you will say to yourself: here I would move to BE, here I would take profit, here I would not take that trade, here I would do that and there I would do that.   
  
You know, why you are not profitable and you dont have any trading system? Because you are looking for your holy grail, best would be to have about 90% profitable trades without any work. You jump from thread to thread asking if it is still profitable, if anyone backtest this and backtest that, how much one can make with this strategy.   
  
You should wake up. If you like simplicity, stick to this strategy, and do FORWARD test, how you can test your FEELINGS about market in backtest? Tell me. How you can test your EMOTIONS in backtest? Tell me. How you can test your money managment in backtest? Tell me.  
  
Of course, it will take some time, but if you can not do consitent profits on demo, how the f*** you want to it do live?   
  
I am going to tell you HOLY GRAIL. - The Holy Grail is inside you. What does it mean?   
  
**Your head.  
Your emotion.   
Your money managment. **  
  
You have your power in **engulfing** pattern, you can see, when bears or bull are taking over. Is it under or above MA? Great, what about to ask another question, why it should go there or there, how big is probability of going that way? Is it near to any important level, where it can break? Try to do some work, try to look for more things, try to build confidence, try to see more things. NOT IN A BACKTESTING!  
  
Great thread, keep going!

No problem, this is your opinion. I know, that some people consider backtesting useless. I do consider it useful, but there is no point to start long discussion.

Seriously!!!!!!!!  
This approach that HZS10 has put forward is so simple and requires zero emotion when traded. Requires zero decision analysis. Requires zero trade management except to move a SL to BE...not emotional at all I would say.  
  
I did a simple visual backtest as I described and erred on the side of the losses in order to keep emotion out of it, as a result my win percentages are actually lower than they could be with the steps I talked about earlier.  
  
But as we agree time will tell us both the answer.

I was not talking about visual backtest. Of course you will do always some visual backtest, it is human brain, we all do that.

It’s the same as the op/ hzs10 is using mate. Just the SL is extra 0.236 from the low or high of candle  
The secret to this system & all system is the money management / risk management. Happy trading ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/2615.png?v=15.1)

hello everyone .. first of all a huge thanks to hzs10, for sharing this trategy so detailed with everyone, in the environment of the traders, few are so kind.  
I am a trader since 2006 and I already knew this strategy, but not so detailed, so again thanks to hzs10.  
I read all the threads, and I noticed that many did not understand how an ENGULFING should be configured, without wishing to confuse anyone, if you want I recommend this extremely precise tool in recognizing a perfect engulfing,  
obviously configurable, with push notifications, and it is possible to eliminate the SL TP lines in order to continue using the Fibo recommended by hzs10.  
(costs $ 12, this is not my product, and I'm not advertising the manufacturer, but I simply bought and tried this indicator, just for this reason I recommend)

Nice strategy, especially the simplicity. I do have one question. How do you add the price levels on the fib lines? I'm using the mobile android version.

Nb. The create of this thread uses high and low of the candle to determine the engulfing scenario and not all alerts from this indicator will line up the same as her definition since this indicator also uses the body to determine ENGULFING and not the high and low alone, so unless there are parameters to select that aspect of the high and low only you might mixed signals which do not line up exactly with her specific candle pattern, you will get some but not all the time.  
  
However I believe the 150 zone is really 1 : 0.5 RR and 200 is simply 1:1 RR so the indicator is actually equipped to function for the fibonnaci's original intension...The only difference is the ema filter.  
  
**My stupid advice is to take this one instead if you want to stick to her identifies rules of signal bar.<https://www.mql5.com/en/market/product/3719>.**  
  
Nevertheless this is mobile trading and I don't believe she is really interested in those alternative solutions. She seems to be quite comfortable using her mobile which is giving her the results she's looking for and displaying effortlessly like a lethal weapon in the markets.  
  
Trade safe...

Somebody can make EA? Some strategys with EA is useless but this with such mechanical rules is good for EA. If EA trading could be with no sucess than manual trading too be in loss with this system

This is ENGULFING Bar... not all setups will match the OP's definition. Some do but not all. Don't make this mistake. However the two last pictures that show trades actually fit the description.

So what you are saying, TO prove that any trading strategies work, we need to build an EA and if EA will be successful our manual trading will be successful, right? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

Thanks for this. That is the reason I stop backtesting. My previous “mentor” also teach backtest which I think is not useful to me so I stopped. I think the best is to use demo and do forward testing. However, for those who are comfortable, I wont stop you from doing it. Whether you want to go the long route or just be efficient.

You know why? Because, you will say to yourself: here I would move to BE, here I would take profit, here I would not take that trade, here I would do that and there I would do that. You know, why you are not profitable and you dont have any trading system? Because you are looking for your holy grail, best would be to have about 90% profitable trades without...

Here is a nice engulfing/outside bar indi.  
![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f440.png?v=15.1)  
  
All joking aside, thank you to hzs10 for this nice system. It is allowing me to apply something consistently during my workday and, unlike some daily candle systems I have messed with, has enough frequency and moves quickly enough for my general impatience![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1). 

Wow! I've got some experience to gain.

> Guys, you are talking about backtesting. Great. What you will find out? That one pair was 80% successful so you are going to trade it? I can backtest 100 strategies and they will be all successful. You know why? Because, you will say to yourself: here I would move to BE, here I would take profit, here I would not take that trade, here I would do that and there I would do that. You know, why you are not profitable and you dont have any trading system? Because you are looking for your holy grail, best would be to have about 90% profitable trades without...

To suggest backtesting is of no use misses the point as far as I'm concerned. Naturally, all strategies should be exposed to forward testing but not to back test just shows a hole in a trader's game IMHO. Efficient backtesting isn't used to curve fit PT and SL; it's value lies in other things such as gauging maximum drawdown via monte carlo for money management purposes and a whole host of other things which I won't bore you with. Walk forward analysis, which is the closest thing to forward testing on historical data, is also of value. There are a million and one setups that worked over the last six months but will fail miserably in six months time, backtesting/walk forward analysis can help the trader assess the likely longevity of a strategy.  
  
This post is not to knock the engulfing strategy of this thread as I've done a statistical analysis a long time ago about daily engulfing candles and already know that short term trades (1 to 3 days) have a good edge for the last 20 years for the pairs analysed (and this was without the EMA30). This reply is more about rebuking a post that undermines a solid tool in the trader's toolbox which if, used correctly, adds a lot of value. Forward testing is also essential.  
  
Sorry for my post, I noticed the comment about backtesting on the main FF page and had to respond.

You have to add a percentage symbol and a dollar sign in the description. %$ ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f448-1f3fb.png?v=15.1)like this.

Might be good to get an idea of how well it develops, nevertheless so far discretionary trading outperforms any EA. I have a system that is profitable as an EA but it’s even more profitable if discretion is applied.

I think you’re right. Objective backtesting is good to avoid having faith or hoping it works, And you can optimize the strategy by watching the results.

Hello, first of all thank you for sharing your system and ideas.  
I just wanna share these photos with all maybe we could share our experience or maybe this would be a good chance for all to make some good pips.  
I think those three pairs now are good for entring short according to your rules.  
Am I right or not??

Anything above the line is an uptrend, below the line is a downtrend.

hzs10 and friends,  
  
Im thinking about making a telegram group for us to post potential setups.  
we can share setups quickly for example, "AUDUSD buy, EURJPY sell, etc".  
Yes our candles might be different due to brokers, but members can see if their charts show the similar setup the other members share and decide themselves if they going to take the setup or not.  
  
i dont mean to create a group for signal services or spoonfeed the newbies, but the more eyes the better right?  
if hzs or any other against this idea i will delete it right away. 

Ask, and it is given. Every single time, no exceptions.

I like this idea, nice to be able to bounce trade ideas off others. Also a bit quicker than posting here.

Well it all depends on hzs10, since most times a social group starts the thread dies shortly after.  
  
Now as stated before i believe instead of asking hzs10 which broker which she obviously will not disclose I think if she tells us her gmt offset that would help. _**Ok Gold has a setup that is on for 1 broker with gmt +2 but the other broker with gmt+3 doesn't have it.**_ Can anyone share their findings.  
  
So let's just clarify those with the setup on gold to share their get offset, if hzs10 has the gold setup then that will help to identify the best gmt time zone. Before long you will know if your broker will qualify for this strategy yes or no.

I think we all need to base _**Tradingview.com ([FXCM](/brokers/fxcm "View FXCM Broker Profile")) chart**_. As far as I can see, it is the best

3 options I hope it's ok here on FF:  
<https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=109305>  
Use this p4l clock to check the broker time against the gmt/UTC time. Or compare your market watch time with gmt time.  
  
Otherwise check to see your broker time offset and report back here: <https://www.allfxbrokers.com/brokers/platforms/mt4>  
  
Next one is gmt offset indicator from mql:<https://www.mql5.com/en/market/product/10173>

I personally wont be on it like that...it may work for others though especially if you code the alert...  
As for me if you check your broker a d don't see this setup then it won't work on your broker candle time.

hzs, how do you handle correlated pairs?  
do you take all of them or do you pick the best ones? 

Ask, and it is given. Every single time, no exceptions.

There are 29 four hour possibilities for opportunity using the H4 timeframe per week per asset. Of course this makes it possible for one to get almost perfect trades, so don't rush. Pay attention those that lost versus those that Won, what are the major differences if any, there are possibilities that may exist such as round number, support and resistance or supply and demand zones. What if those factors make a difference between or win or loss, otherwise keep it as simple as possible.

Once you wrote you don't use every engulfing looking for PA. Now you wrote you don't look at SR. What are PAs for you?

It has already been said. You must learn price action. In this case you don't want to buy into strong resistance.

USDCAD setting up nicely, but I love it more because the current 4Hr bar might end as a bearish pin bar which reinforces the bearish bias. Anybody watching it?

TBM - sorry if i missed the post, but what percentage or # are your trades triggered at?  
Meaning how much to you let it retrace before your enter? (about half the candle of the engulfing bar?)

**Learn the basic strategy in order to:**

  1. **identify the bars and the overall setup**
  2. **choose and use proper money management that facilitates losses-they will come**
  3. **Trade your way into knowing this thing for yourself, she clearly states that she is perfecting this method that is not entirely hers but she tried and tweaked for about a month and decided to share it here.**
  4. **I am personally greatful as i learnt an easier systematic way to approach this same setup that can make a difference between being a loser or a winner with an edge.**
  5. **Obviously our involvement will help to make it better hopefully if we stick to the basic rules.**
  6. **Adding more to it will complicate things, which usually happen more often than not and then the system don't work according to original intentions.**

I have a trading partner who turned $69 into over $600 in a short time using this same concept only a different ema on h4, daily & weekly (longterm). His way was very complicated, nevertheless If it worked for him and this is working for her to move 3k to probably over 5k now, why shouldn't the basic idea work for everyone else?

I always use hammer candles on daily TF in direction of trend, few little rules for TP levels but with that you will have 3-4 months where it’s amazing results then you sort of give a bit back.   
I would anticipate the engulfing candle on the Daily would be the same, but stops will be wider.  
  
be interesting in seeing the results after a month ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d-1f3fb.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d-1f3fb.png?v=15.1)

So the engulfing is setting up between EMA30 line. Is this acceptable for short position if it set up bearish engulf ?

My macd and stoc are doing a hook, and its a setting to be bearish engulfing. And looking to close below ema30, you should be shorting

I got hit SL too. GBP pairs tend to have bigger spread. So consider adding the spread in for GBP pairs

well yes and no.  
Yes the [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") are high but no, the spread at the time was nowhere near the price i got stopped out on....  
I have sent the broker an email with the screen shots of everything that had unfolded....  
  
Thanks for the reply...loving the system

The Star is the limit.  
Nice was also looking at this setup, i have placed my buy stop above the candle wick .  
i am also looking at entering a smaller position lot size on the 50%retracement but with similar stop loss and TP projections as per Hzs10's rules.  
thats the only rule ive adjusted on my end in a bid to make thee RR ratio a little more favourable.  
  
  
What indicator is that on your chart that allows you to toggle the different currency pairs?

I was wondering, what would you do if you entry (next bar market) is really close to your sl? Like when the signal is to go long but the candle closes on it lowest low, right where you stoploss is...

Was this at daily close? If so I know my broker increase spread a lot after the daily close for gbp-pairs. Especially for gbpaud and gbpnzd. I know for example that gbpnzd increase spread about 40 pips around this time. When I trade gbpaud/gbpnzd and the price is less than 40 pips from my SL before (maybe 10 minutes) daily close I increase my SL until the spread gets normal (set SL back after 1 hour).

great advise much appreciated.  
  
I thought as much. my issue was there were no wicks or anything to suggest a sudden spike up.  
  
Spoke to broker this morning and they attributed it to the move being too quick upwards blah blah blah.

This is an easy system to follow and it seems every one is doing well.  
I just need to ask what your take is when you miss a signal and find it retracing.  
Do you enter on a retrace especially when you miss a signal and is it ok to enter below the entry price of the signal candle?

Before entering trade u must decide will it retrace or not,  
How u decide,only experience can help

I love your transparency...I was wondering about some results myself however I just got a little comfort with that picture...Just wondering if there is a way to avoid or minimize those losses:

  1. were the setups opposite bars or same
  2. Were they equal to the ema-ema ran through the setup bar body or range
  3. Were they bars that closed more than 50% of the setup candle range
  4. Did a candle(s) retrace before heading into the 100% zone
  5. Was the ema flat

Those are my few concerns.  
If those are true would the opposite work best for those awesome winners?

I supposed u are experienced trader and if so you should know there is no 100% win strategy. What one trader should consider about is not about the win but losses. There is a reason for reward to risk. The purpose for it is not for ur strategy to look nice. The purpose is whether you can accept the loss if you enter a trade. If you cant handle the loss then dont enter the trade.   
  
People only show the win to look nice. I am showing people the lost trades to show them the reality. People trade emotionally bc fear of losing. If they dont overcome it they will not able to trade objectively.   
  
I started off learning Fx trading that 100pips is minimal target and there are people on FF pm me that they have traded for years and not win more than 50pips in single trade. I suppose is a scalping. But do note that with this simple strategy that i trading purely in phone with such result is good enough for me.  
  
If you think it is not good enough, you can always improvise to suit you. However you wont get that perfect strategy that goes your way always.   
  
On the other hand it is good that you came up with those questions that means you critical think abt the strategy and not follow blindly. That way you learn more. Maybe you can test out each of yoyr hypothesis and see which one work out the best and share here.

It is not that i always trade objectively. I think it is hard to anyone to do that all the time bc we are human and we have emotion. Once you start winning the fear will actually come. That is the reason of setting your rules and see how discipline you are. Once the rules are set. Stick as close to those rules and keep reminding yourself. Self-discipline is important. Not just trading Fx, but in anything you do if you want long-term success.

I don't like USDCHF because it can be painfully slow. But for anyone who wants to take it, all the conditions are met.  
  
Additional tip: RSI bounced of suport and is pointing up. By the time it gets to 70 maybe price might hit TP.  
  
My only worry: 30EMA is flattish.

Ok Basically my concerns (below) were answered through the trade results that she posted. I thought i was doing something wrong when I encountered a few losses, only to realise that she experienced a similar scenario.

  1. **Were the setups opposite bars or same-** Not in all cases, i find that you can be strict with opposite bars or have same colour bars-sell signal with 2 bearish bars versus a bullish then a bearish signal candle. I found that her first bar that is engulfed by the outside/engulfing bar can be any colour-matching the direction of the trade, while the bar being engulfed body type (opposite or same) does not matter significantly.
  2. **Were the setups equal to the ema-ema ran through the setup bar body or range-** I saw some setups having the ema run through the body or wick space of the candle (**and they worked great**). Another rule may apply where it strictly states that the signal candle should not be touching the ema, (**a limiting factor). I believe that as long as it closes in favour of the trade signal direction above or below the ema, all is well**.
  3. **Did the bars close more than 50% of the setup candle's range-** I have seen setups work perfect with candle's closing almost like a doji.
  4. **Did a candle(s) retrace before heading into the 100% zone-** The setup can have retracements and still win, in addition the retracements can also be used to gain a higher risk to reward ratio.
  5. **Was the ema flat-** It can be an angle of 45 degrees to 70 degrees and still fail, so take the setups when it is available and meet the basic rules.
  6. **The most perfect trade can lose.**

**N.B. There are about three (3) order types that one can choose from:**  
**Market order-** Aggressive but good entry most times**-** rather than the high or low of the setup candle which may be wick space  
**Limit order-** Less risky and may get more profit- It is not guaranteed to be triggered at all.  
**Stop Order-** Sometimes price may not break the 100% zone and result in a change of direction, where market orders and limit orders suffer the obvious consequences hitting Stop loss.

You may miss some signals, while other brokers with different gmt offset may still get the signal but the bars may be shaped a little bit different. I believe most signals appear on gmt 2, but i have seen similar signals on gmt 3 based brokers too.  
Try to find the ones that would line up to the signals of others or HZS10. It will be worth it to solve this as early as possible,. In the meantime, just use the opportunity to compare the signals posted here in the thread and see if your candles match those signals being posted.  
The issue may be if your present broker has a sunday candle or not. I hope this helps.

Everyone will get signals, might not all match but there will be signals to catch.

Not sure how you set your chart up, but I took the UC trade on the 15th and wound up with a whopping $28.23 gain before being stopped out on the 16th. Good thing I broke the rules and moved my stop loss before I was supposed to. Or maybe I should have just left the stop loss where it was and let the trade run for a few more days. I hate being in what turn out to be sideways trades for days and days.

USDJPY 4HR chart below.  
  
Check 1: Bounced nicely off the 30EMA  
Check 2: Bearish candle has a lower low but the highs are equal.  
  
Additional tip: RSI pointing firmly down.  
  
Anyone considering this trade?

Mirror bars are more powerful than engulfing IMO there's just less of them at the start and end of moves.

Please pardon my ignorance. So with this somewhat mirror bar, what does it likely portend?

UJ has been selling off for days after a steady rise on the daily, and currently the daily is firmly under the 30EMA. I don't know if the recent selloff is a correction or if it will continue. However, I also have in mind that the 61.8% fib retracement of the rise has not been touched. So maybe it's just a correction.   
  
On a final note, using this strategy, I just want pips on the four hour. Even if it's uptrend we can still steal pips, right?![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f600.png?v=15.1)

Price seems to be changing structure from previous downtrend, I would watch PA, following strat it should be 200 level.  
  
If this is a real higher low, we will see a break upwards of the current resistance, which means a new high soon, honestly, if I can monitor the trade I'm not setting TPs, or at least not a hard one and I'm closing when I feel like its time to close, so in this case, if price is not able to break res and forms a double top.  
  
But I think the intention of this post is to follow mechanichally instructions, so set your TP and forget.

so should we only take trades if the engulfing candle ''engulfs'' previous candles which are of the opposite direction or can we also take trades where the 1st and englufing candle are of the same direction?  
  
thanks....testing it out currently...someone got some stats on h4?

Here is something for you guys.  
  
It will show an arrow above (bearish) or below (bullish) when **close** is below 30 EMA and candle is engulfing. It has Popup Alert, Email and push. You can easily set it up on a cheap server for notifications rather than looking at each chart one by one.  
  
If there are any bugs let me know and I will fix it.  
  
Had a bit of draw down this week, see how the rest goes.

Yeah, your own 4hour chart means you may enter after this candle closes. I have already entered because my broker's timeframe is different. Here is my old chart few hours ago (not updated) upon which I based my entry:

This gives alert only for bullish engulfing when over 30 ema and bearish engulfing when under 30 ema? 

Anything above the line is an uptrend, below the line is a downtrend.

Well, taken out at break even after trade went 24 pips in my favour. No more shorting UJ for now.

Yes all three (email, popup, push to mobile) alerts if you wish. You just need to setup your MT4 email & push settings.

Hi Everyone!  
I would like to thank hzs10 for sharing this simple yet promising idea. And as my nickname suggests, I hope this system will end my margin call habit LOL.  
Is anyone on the same trade E/U as mine below?  
Judging from the broader TF, I am quite confident the current candle will engulf the previous one, continuing south direction. Any suggestion whether I add short position on the next candle if signals confirm?  
  
Thanks,  
-Joe-

Don't worry Loss is the part of game. From how many days you are using this strategy and how much your profit/loss? You are using Octaforex and is this broker is good? I mean spread, services, withdrawal and deposit? I am also from pk that's why i am asking You

I'm not in this one because it's not a valid entry.. :-) always wait for the candle close (you got lucky this time but you might not the next time :-)

TradingMom, thank you for the insight. But I still think this was valid. I entered shortly after that smaller candle (pointed with arrow) opens.  
Fib on the engulfing candle, trade open on next candle, price was below EMA 30 (EMA not drawn in the screenshot). Could you please advise what had invalidated the entry?  
By the way trade has closed at new SL. +24pips.

Looking at it aswell, however, a bit of overhead resistance, i wanna rather buy pullback just to better my risk reward.   
If i miss it i miss it,Overhead resistance just a little too thick for my blood![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)

**AUDJPY** 4HR Chart  
  
Check 1: bullish outside bar (candle 2 from right)  
Check 2: candles closing above 30EMA  
  
**Additional tip:** Candle 6 from right is a bullish hammer with the next confirming reversal upwards.  
  
**Plan** : Not in this trade yet. I'll wait for retrace and confidently buy.

Near-term resistance ahead around 80.584 on AudJpy...but you might be lucky. Could just blow thru it.

If you analyze most of this week's setups more closely, you will discover they did not pass for trading due to one or more of the following:  
  
Setup hindered by support or resistance.  
EMA flat, i.e price not trending up or down.  
Set-up on the wrong side of the EMA.  
  
I like to stay out when I see any of the above.

By the way trade has closed at new SL. +24pips.

Is not an engulfing in my rule book... the one before the one with the red arrow, it doesn’t meet the qualifications, it should be higher and lower then the candle before that (engulfing it)

Nice Job AgeTrader.   
  
One query: Have you considered the rule that the body of the Engulfing bar should be a minimum of 50% of the body of the previous bar for these signals?.  
  
Thank you.  
Krismitt.

Yeah I meant to look for divergence in M30 rather than H4. Below are some screenshot of what a setup looks like in M15

It will be better if you open a new thread and make all the experiments. Minor modifications like watching the slope of sma, support/resistance, following the higher frame trend, placing the stop order on the break out instead of at the opening of the candle etc are still okay as it follows the original concept but adding a completely new idea or filter is almost like trespassing into some one else's property. This is the biggest problem here in FF; people start hijacking the moderately popular thread and then the thread owner vanishes. Look around, you will hardly find the thread owner in any of those long running thread. I am not against your experiment with different filters but it would be helpful if you show that in an existing thread only after doing some successful tests of course with the permission of the thread owner. Please don't take this in a bad spirit..just an opinion..

Hi, i am from singapore too! Which timezone do you trade mostly?  
Strategy seems very workable. Probably instead of 1 micro lot, i probably do position sizing so the drawdown will look better ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Hi Syedtaimur:  
  
Are you closing at Fib Ext. 150 or 200?

Now if it is just the comment you don't like you can dislike & and no else will see it unless you had quoted it, if it is the person you ignore and they will not be able to participate in the thread.

Yes but just ignore them. I had notifications on other system every 15 minutes. My phone ringing all day however I can take maybe only 2 trades a day.

Check the inputs tab and I think where it says candle something I'm not at my computer change it from 0 to 1. I did this yesterday and I hope it solves the issue. We'll see tomorrow

By the way, does using this system totally overlook major S&R?  
Most of the time after engulfing, the price level is always very near S&R. In this case should we take the trade?

This should fix the alert problem, but please test it and make sure. I haven't been able to see two engulfing patterns in a short period of time to make sure the second one also alerts.  
  
The 50% above/below is not yet coded.

Here are my trades with HZS10 aproach. I traded 4h with HH HL or LL LH looking to the trend. Now with the engulfing candle after HH HL or LL LH can improve my entries .  
Thanks HZS10

GBPCHF Daily bearish engulfing candle. I´ve just took the trade... Also I already was in another trade in this pair. I am expecting 245 Pips for both trades.

Hello my friend. Well I don´t want to spoiled the thread, but for my own testing that kind of pattern is also successful, taking into account we don´t know what the market is going to really do. Do you want to see the kind of bearish engulfing which HSZ10 mentioned switch to 8H graphic same pair and then you will see it with alot of room if you display the fibonacci proportions which she has mentioned too and that 8H movement is involved in the Daily engulfing candle which I took today , and since it is a Daily candle we will know the results by 2 or 3 days from now!   
Also I confirm the engulfing candles with volume and also I analyze RSI and MACD, but this is out of discussion since the thread does not have the purpose to discuss things like this.... what I mean is that despite the effective strategy which HSZ10 has share with us, you may look at your own backtesting and use your own tools so you can be prepared if this strategy stops working or for your own calm when you take a trade.  
  
Please look the USDCAD trade which I took last week with the same criteria than todays trade.   
  
But after all, price will tell! Regards!

Bro so instead of using 30ema, you use pure price action to determine the trend and S&R for the hunting zone and use engulfing to time the entry?

TP hit, this trade was against my rules and HSZ10, but price reach an important support zone and the engulfing candle reject that zone with a large shadow. That´s why I get in....

An example that I cant look at the chart even using phone when i am busy with work.   
  
This trade has been taken for days and I wanted to close when PA touch at 150 again. Ard SL to entry. So it hit SL when I look at it again. Well, at least I can shift SL to BE using my phone. Still end with +pips

Hi Jeff90, exactly, was not by my rules, and I pointing it. But reach an important support zone and the engulfing candle showed a large shadow rejecting the support, that´s why I took the trade. I follow the HH HL and LL LH for my trades, and goes with the trend. Adding the HSZ10 rule I can improve my trading.

It would be better if it closed below the opening of the bearish candle

So true. I used PASR to identify big boss, boss, worker, for direction. S&R for hunting zone. Engulfing for timing. working well so far.

Close the trade manually, don't like the timming of the trade. Take the profit and move on.

**@hzs10**  
  
How do you think about this?  
Example trade.  
Maybe on bearish engulfing, we only draw fibo at High to the closed candle, not High to the Low as usual you did it.  
  
In CADJPY case on pictured below, this trade will not hit SL but endup with BE.  
If we draw fibo from High to the Low as usual, the price never reach 150%, so we never set trade to BE, and endup hit SL.

Sometimes, especially on news event no system can work properly. So we have to pay attention on news events.

**@hzs10**  
  
What do you think about this?  
Setting the target not on 200% but at 100% range of engulfing candle, like entry style-1.  
And still used 150% to move BE.

In my opinion, it too late if we entry with wait next candle to broke that engulfing candle.

Im sorry hzs10, i dont want to confusing others, maybe i can get some answer.

**@hzs10**  
  
What your opinion about this?  
  
Base on this result of 9 trade is 5 loss, 4 win, so its 44% win rate.  
Let said we are using 2% risk per trade, with 44% win rate, and aiming 1:1 per trade,  
according to the table at that website, we are facing risk of ruin at 100% rate.  
So we need rise TP to 300% not 200% to avoid risk of ruin.

**@hzs10**  
  
And how about if we are facing losing strike, and win rate drop to 30%?  
I think we need rise TP to 300-500%.  
So risk of ruin handled at 0%-1%.  
What do you think?

Hello,  
  
I am new and very interested in the strategy. But i have some questions.  
1 Where can i get the fibonacci that gives the exact price levels for SL and TP etc.  
2 I have been reading for a few months now on FF and what the most common thing is to learn price action.  
Where and how can i learn the best price action?  
  
I hope to get some answers. Thank you all for helping the strategy and for acknowleding my questions.  
  
Kind regards

You can’t base a win rate on 9(!!) trades... plus... you mentioned that you enter early (or intended to), then a backtest of 9 trades is useless. My personal backtests need at least 50 trades on the same pair and always following the rules exactly...

Yup im very agreed to you, 9 trade not good sample, we need atleast 100 trades.  
Im just worried about this risk of ruin matters.  
And tried to open disscused about this.  
  
Note:  
I never enter trades early, if you check my trades screenshot, the trades taken after engulfing candle is closed.

I agree on the EURUSD. But I’m not to sure about the CADCHF... for if a pair is in trend I need a impulse leg, retracement and a new structure high... CADCHF seems to be consolidated :-)

Ah good, my mistake! Did you take in consideration that after hitting the 150 fib level, the trades should be put to break even..? That changes a bit on the r:r  
side :-). Risk of ruin is, imo also a very personal thing, because we all read a price chart differently and have different views on trend...

If we talk only trade rules by hzs10, so that is valid setup.  
But if we look at previous candle, there are mother candle formation.  
Mother candle formation is consolidating area that need to break so the trade can be take.

As hzs10 rules, after hitting 150% we must switch SL to 100% not BE.

Fear makes you judge. After the losing period will come the winner one. Keep practicing. The past few days have many losses but see the big picture. Although I gave half of the profit back to the market i still earn >400+pips.

> @hzs10 How do you think about this? Example trade. Maybe on bearish engulfing, we only draw fibo at High to the closed candle, not High to the Low as usual you did it. In CADJPY case on pictured below, this trade will not hit SL but endup with BE. If we draw fibo from High to the Low as usual, the price never reach 150%, so we never set trade to BE, and endup hit SL. {image}

What if the price didn hit 150 here and hit SL? Will you keep changing your rules? You only pick 1 scenerio that fit in to your setting. Past results does not represent future one. You can test it and see whether it works and if the results are better you can share here to others.

Normally news will only affect lower TF if you test enough TF. I used to be paranoid when it comes to high impact news. Who really do take notes of news when they do backtest? If you did backtest before on H4, it doesnt really matter for most strategy

You can use it to do scalping if you want. 200 point is not a impossible target on H4. Most of the time it is not even 50pips.   
  
This strategy is for those who have no time to keep staying in front of the computer and want to trade using phone without any anxiety who needs to keep looking at the chart.   
  
Trust me, I have been there before. Sitting in front of computer, getting affect by the PA. Eyes and mind draining.

Let said we are using 2% risk per trade, with 44% win rate, and aiming 1:1 per trade, according to the table at that website, we are facing risk of ruin at 100% rate. So we need rise TP to 300% not 200% to avoid risk of ruin.

What is the time period of these trade? Will you do backtest with only 9 trades and determine the win rate of a strategy?  
  
i wouldnt even say what is the win rate of this strategy because it is only the 2nd month. I already said test at on risk using real acc. If not confident use demo. Read post #2 again and again

Sad to say that. I have made a lot of tests of this "strategy" (manual with a trading simulator with the past news support) and I made an EA for autotrading. I test one dozen of pairs and in the medium and long term (last 3 years) we loose money. Does'nt matter if you filter trades with a moving average 30, 35, 40, 50 etc. etc. and move or not to BE your order, the results are the same. Maybe you will get better results if you make your own additional analisi before to take a trade (fundamentals, S/R, trend lines, volumes etc...).  
  
I don't want to discredit this system and creator, but these are the facts. Forex is a hugly beast, and today is not easy to manage with a "simple" system. I tell this because now I have at least 10 years of forex manual trading experience, and I have tested a lot of systems.

My previous “mentor” have decades of experience. He is charging other’s free online contents for thousands. He told every one he is the most conservative person who doesnt risk high. Yet he lost 40k out of 50k USD of my mum’s fund within a year. So dont need to tell me how many years of experiences you have. Some still losing money in Fx with 10years of trading experience. I only have 1 year experience but doesnt mean my knowledge or trading experience is not good as you.  
  
Does your content do any help to this thread? Does anyone not know why u saying? So does it necessary for you to spent those minutes typing that. If not read post #2 over and over again. Tyvm

It's about time someone give an alternative view to this "strategy". Without such discussions people will waste time and money.

Yes the content will help those with stars in their eyes. Those naïve enough to believe your rules (above) in their current form, will make a long-term profitable system. You yourself have not yet figured that out. In time you will.  
  
Btw, don’t be so quick to cut people off that disagree with you. **Allow full and uncensored discussion.** It is the only means by which your rules have a chance of developing into a trading strategy.

I can't speak for the 4hr charts but the daily charts I tested manually gave high win rates, I am currently forward testing the daily charts that gave a win percentage of 65% or higher. I have and HZS10 has said that the forward tests still need to show if the low risk/reward ratio out-weighs the win rate.  
In my opinion the nay-sayers should stand aside, shut up and let us get on with our live forward tests.  
We'll let you know!!!

We have to respect the wishes of the owner and apply her strategy to improve it with the PA and not incorporating indicators that mess up the graphics. who does not like MUST to look for another thread and make his trading quiet. Í don't think it is a strategy without a good profit, I occupy it with the price action HH HL and LL LH and I am doing very well until now. Here the discussion has to go to another point that is to share the strategy and not criticize something that can be useful to people who are newly incorporated.

Good morning folks,  
This strategy started by hzs10 has its merit and lets not sent it into an early grave. Just for information, there is another thread in ff currently into its second year and has 10 thousand post as of this morning. It uses similar moving average cross over although it does not use engulfing bar as a trigger. It is just cross and if ma is downward pointing, enter short. My point is just this. If hzs10 strategy is very similar to this 10 thousand post thread strategy, there must surely be some substance to keep it alive for some time before we draw any conclusion. Having said that, in my humble opinion, our strategy could have room to just deviate a little with a confirmation after seeing the engulfing bar. For some of us who uses candlestick, you would surely agree that you do not simply enter after seeing a pin bar at support. You need to see confirmation. You need to see a follow-up. Its the same as seeing an engulfing bar. We are anticipating (not a reversal) but a continuation of the trend. It would perhaps be prudent to say we need to see the next bar after the engulfing to close above or below the engulfing depending on whether it is a buy or sell. In my earlier post 761, I did not enter when the next 4 hr bar did not close above the engulfing. I was right, the price have since came down. But this is just my one example and I may not be right always with this tweak. Only time will tell. So can we just move on and be encouraged with some positive comments? Isnt this why we are here in the first place?

I have been very transparent since first post and accept all comment if only for people who have tested the strategy and not some “experience” trader who tell me how many years of trading experience they have. If you dont under simple english in post #2, maybe you can go brush up your english first

Good one DJsignal. As you can see there was a confirmation bearish that close below the low of the bearish engulfing, just before the bull bar. After the confirmation, the price dropped with one big bear. Coincidence? Maybe

What I wonder, is why belief someone who posts just simply: it doesn’t work... no data, no exact rules used, no numbers....if one tested the strategy, manual or automated, there would/should be data to share...  
and you don’t ‘believe’ the one who started the topic and shared all kind of info..

So i been trying out some time with proper price action analysis, it's actually quite profitable.  
I think it is in the right direction but certain adjustment need to be made.  
  
Firstly, as a pure price action trader:

  1. i never like using indicators. I use price action to determine the trend (HH,HL, buyer/seller market, big boys, multi-tf, etc)
  2. the SL should be at the place where price are difficult to cross over, basically the S&R level. So draw your S&R properly and only take up trades that form engulfing at this crucial level. Your SL should be below the engulfing and below the S&R so it doesnt cross hit your SL easily. your TP should also not be on the other side of the S&R.
  3. Do currencies correlation first. strong vs strong, weakest vs strongest usually gives alot of spikes. It will certainly hit your SL because this strategy has rather tight SL

It's nothing new, it's just high probability trading method that all price action trader know.  
  
Of course all these requires proper charting tool. It will be difficult or cannot be done with just mobile.  
So just ignore everything i said ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f600.png?v=15.1)

Hi Zack,  
I believe your input is valuable, and although this strategy has been proven to improve this thread followers' profitability, there are still areas can be optimized using more complex device than just a mobile phone. But hey, the thread title actually says it all: **Simple,** and **Mobile**.  
Just like the TS, I do not always carry laptop with me, while my fingers keep craving for tapping those "Buy" or "Sell" buttons, therefore this simple system is one of my best options, rather than having to carry a laptiop anywhere I go.

1 week trading HSZ10 strategy, for those that don't believe and are crítics about the sistem...stop doing and start reading and re-reading from post 1. The only advise I can tell you is GO WITH THE TREND and don't loose your money doing other things. HH HL ...LL LH and Look for engulfing candle, that's all. HSZ10 thanks for share your knowledge and time to show and teach everybody here the setups.

Thank you for your kind comment bro.  
  
Indeed it is a hassle to do PA analysis on the move and on mobile, but i have a small suggestion which can improve your hit/miss rate by 5-10%  
  
I noticed that while it is a trend following strategy, some of the trades are actually counter trend. What do i mean by this?  
On the H4 it is uptrend but daily it is downtrend. So you are actually buying the pullback instead of buying at the impulse.  
  
It is common for pullbacks to last for 5-10 days on a weaker trending pairs. 30EMA on 4H is 5 days. That means you could still be in pullback zone even though 30EMA shows the trend. Trading counter trend is not a problem since the strategy generally last less than a day. But it becomes a problem if you hold too long or you have traded very near to the daily S&R level. Always respect the higher timeframe.  
  
So just check back the higher timeframe trends to make sure you have confluence on timeframe. Cheers & godspeed!

I also ‘modified’ the sl a little bit... because having it at 1.1599 (for example) is just waiting for it to be hit, even handled numbers are a thing, in my experience and it really helps to change it to 1.1603.. depending on the trade of course but it does make the system a little bit better :-)

Agree. If another bear bar closed below the engulfing low that is a confirmation for me.

Hi Velol  
For a moment I thought I was on wrong thread. It is a sell as it is below the ema. The engulfing bar is bearish not bullish. Please read author rule. Or are you in the wrong thread?

LOL. I actually agree with Velol: EURNZD appealed me more to buy, as the bar was preceded by a series of HH and HL. However, as I started typing this, the price had went south. Congrats to TheBestMA and josephkee for the good luck.   
But the next time I see this kind of setup, I would still stay back. To me, the PA gives mixed signals.

you and i have the same idea for the long run. I think these levels are good to buy and hold for some 150-200 pips.

Hi there. EURNZD bounds off 1.7407 support again. After this hammer candle close, i might buy and exit before the resistance 1.750.  
Weakness in NZD continues as can be seen across the market. I think it is quite safe to long

Agreed, it would be the Long for next candle  
  
For all signal at post #2, the signal good for sell and I got TP at 150% as well, (the resistant level close to current price, so I don't expect to reach 200% fibonacci)   
TP1 was enough  
just confirm that the hsz10's strategy was working well in this case.  
  
Thanks.

Short trade on XAUUSD.  
  
Have already closed 90% of the short entered mainly due to the fact that the setup still shows bullish intent as per my trading rules, and also price was above the 30 ema.  
  
stay green and lets keep making high probable trades.  
I have had less than 5 loosing trades out of 12 trades entered using this system, but thats mainly due to the fact that i have been looking at the overal structure coupled with moving my SL to BE after taking some profit.

Yes those are the rules. thats why i stated 90% of the trade had already been closed.  
I broke that rule and also explained why, structuraly speaking we have an overbought pair thats been struggling to break out higher and there was also a bearish engulfing that further supported the bearish outlook. thats why i entered the short

For me EURNZD is sell setup, if you are afraid then after price at support level around 1.735xx set at BEP.

4H is downtrend, but it is at daily TF support level. So have to wait till for this candle to close and see if it breaks, or become a pin bar, or make a potential engulfing

This 4hr will be crucial. If bullish engulfing is form, then I might go Long.  
1.740 has been tested few times with strong bounds off. Seems like the daily boys are still buying up

Hello Mates  
  
From the EU and GU chart not seeing any SL level? I believe this is not the original setting. As i follow at Fibo SL setting, both trades SL activated.

Using MACD is my personal preference. I follow the MACD Direction along with MA Direction. If MACD reaches the extreme levels I will wait for pullback.  
  
In [OANDA](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile") 500 units means 5 cents.  
  
Have a great day

> Short trade on XAUUSD. Have already closed 90% of the short entered mainly due to the fact that the setup still shows bullish intent as per my trading rules, and also price was above the 30 ema. stay green and lets keep making high probable trades. I have had less than 5 loosing trades out of 12 trades entered using this system, but thats mainly due to the fact that i have been looking at the overal structure coupled with moving my SL to BE after taking some profit. Stay safe and green traders {image}

Congratulations on the strategy, I've been using it for a week and I like it a lot. I was wondering something, nobody tried to create an ea? It should not be very complicated.

I think the 2am est. time - that candle would have been valid buy for USDCHF as bullish engulfing

CHFGBP Last 4hr engulfing candle is yet a valid entry, in fact a better one if enter now!

Hello. Yes, it is in a heavy resistance zone, but in my analysis I belive theres a good chance for a break of resistance to keep going north.

This month’s results. 3rd week onwards half of the profits gave back to the market. This strategy is definitely not perfect but results still look promising for 2nd month. I am still learning and observing. I am open to modifying to the strategy only if you have tested and results are promising. I myself might also start modifying to secure the profits better. I will only post any modification if only the results are promising. If not everything will keep it simple and stay as original rules in post #2  
  
Meanwhile keep posting and ask qns.   
  
  
Stay green pips

Why do you not risk the same amount/% each trade?  
  
Your lot size is fixed so sometimes your SL is 20 pips cost $20 and sometimes SL is 200 pips cost you $200 etc. If the system is truly profitable, then you will be better off fixing your risk.

Indeed a good setup. As for me, I just need to see a confirmation to see if the next bar close above the high of the EB. It is still 3 hour more before the next bar close.

Thanks guys,  
I think everyone trades engulfings differently. Some people like pullbacks and some just taken parabolic straight down and up with momentum.Personally  
i like to trade pullbacks and deep enough to form some type of pivot (2 candles on one side) and enough room to the top left as Trinquete said. And it doesn't hurt if that engulfing lands on a SR zone. Aslo HH and HL's in a trend. Take care

Hi HZS,  
  
I would like to know what is your experience or opinion when there is a strong movement on a specific currency which gives the same signal on multiple correlated pairs. Would you take all the signals? Or would you only choose 1 or 2 pairs which are more convincing?  
  
Many thanks for sharing,  
Puma

I know you guys are anxious to “perfecting” this strategy. I know there are still a lot of loopholes. However I am still testing this strategy, I know i could have earn more last month but hey, 400pips isn’t that bad either for just trading on the phone w/o over stressing your mind.   
  
400pips:  
0.01: 40usd  
0.1: 400usd  
1.0: 4000usd  
  
I just want people to know dont jump conclusion that fast. I do want to “perfect” the strategy too. But let’s give it some time. There are good months and bad months. Most of the time when people dont get the results they want they started to add things in or strategy hopping which doesnt really help the person to learn or grow. I want to know how the original strategy of this strategy fair.   
  
Whatever recommendation given i will take note. I want to make this as simple as possible bc if it is able to consistently produce possitive results I will share it to more people(for free) to help those who want additional financial income. This is my main objective. I want to put a stop to those who say they want to help people and charge them high cost.   
  
This will be a very long experimental strategy. So try to keep this thread as clean as possible. No rubbish or irrelevant contents.  
  
Thanks all for trust in this strategy. Even by the end of this experiment if it is a fail one I hope those who stay here learn something.

God bless you, as your objective is to help those who need help and those who know everything must stay away unless they wanna share their knowledge. People should help instead of criticizing. Keep doing the good work, thanks.

Too many cooks spoil the broth...  
  
Often or not, i have seen many good systems fail after too many other "ingredients' are added into it.   
  
Keep to the original strategy and keep it simple. Happy pips everyone!

So if we got a big bear engulf, an then any bull engulf, but still in the rule. Keep to open? The first bull engulf failed. (blue box). Then any opportunity again in current open position strict to the rule.. I worried because the big an strong bear engulf.

Selamat Siang Widy,  
Judging from your screenshot alone, I cannot tell whether the setup is valid. But IMHO, the following can be used to filter out those 'fake' signals:  
1\. Any news? When mid and high impact news are coming, I better use my phone for gaming to refresh myself.  
2\. Trend. What's trending now? Airplanes? Submarines? If people plays Airplanes, I better play it as well rather than being laughed at. And while reviewing Trend, it is also highly useful (for me: MANDATORY!) to review the trend in higher TFs.  
3\. Still related to the trend: besides staring at our beautiful EMA30, review the market structure:

  1. There should be at very least, one pair of <HH and LH> prior to the engulfing bullish bar before you decide to **buy**
  2. there should be at very least, one pair of <LH and LL> prior to the engulfing bearish bar before you decide to **sell**

4\. Review the immediate and major SR areas. I am quite a conservative guy who enjoys playing within boundaries. Oops sorry, this should have been in your DNA actually.

the rule can be bias while the market is goes to other side, but with stop loss it will more be safe and you just need to open many pair to know the probability, and hope the end result is on Gain position. So the simple is the probability I think, just set and forget.

Yeay today i start test the system, with deposit 5000 on demo account. Open some pair that fit with the rules and walaaaa. ..  
  
Set and forget, this without tp and sl. Just risk of 10% from sum of all the trade. And close is just the sum position is blue.

Just if it is goes blue. Open many pair, strict to the rule and play probability.

I just check it manually and max loss is 10% of balance (sum of all trade), i mean set and forget is to try this sistem. Follow the trend and play probability.

Hello hzs10  
  
Thanks for sharing this strategy, I will be following. I have been trading for about a year now and I find that engulfing bars in the direction of the bigger trend is the best and more profitable way to trade. I will follow the rules set down by you and update the thread with results. I will use the daily trend and daily support/resistance as an additional filter to place trades as that is how I like to trade.   
  
Keep up the good work and profitable trading!

> Guys, you are talking about backtesting. Great. What you will find out? That one pair was 80% successful so you are going to trade it? I can backtest 100 strategies and they will be all successful. You know why? Because, you will say to yourself: here I would move to BE, here I would take profit, here I would not take that trade, here I would do that and there I would do that. You know, why you are not profitable and you dont have any trading system? Because you are looking for your holy grail, best would be to have about 90% profitable trades without...

Currencies are correlated in some form or another.  
Sometimes, taking trades in correlated currencies is the equivalent of taking multiple positions in the same currency.  
Interestingly, knowing if there is a correlation, you can hedge a position to lower your risk. (a different topic, for another thread, perhaps)  
  
If you google "forex currency correlations" it should through up the major ones, and a few strategies as how to profit from them, or how to avoid multiplying your risk.

There's no special treatment, i just follow the rule, then if i late in the next candle (after engulf pattern) i make sure the next candle is not break the engulf candle, than take the open position. Just believed the rule. Open any pair that still at the rule and opportunity, open at the same time and close at the same time.

Congrats to hzs10 on the creation of this system and for sharing it with all of us. The beauty of the system is in it's simplicity and I now use it for trading while I'm at work, all I need to do is sneak away for 10 mins every 4 hours and if there's a setup I can take it!! It's also great that she is willing to accept that the system can be improved upon, and when I trade from my PC I prefer to add some extra filters to the basic system that add some confluence to my trading decisions. My tuppence worth, I think that support/resistance would be a good fit to this system, no point taking a signal that trades straight into a zone, and signals taken at zones tend to be quite good. Keep up the good work and in time I think we could develop quite a robust system from this principles laid down in this thread....

Hi all,  
  
I have been following this forum and testing out this strategy for close to a month. Overall, it is simple to use and results were decent for short timeframe trading.  
  
However, just a humble opinion. I realized that whatever an engulfing candle forms, there were times where the next candle will pull back to fibo 61.8/50.0 of the engulfing candle. Therefore, timing the entry at a better position will lead to a greater reward to risk ratio, sometimes 1.5:1, or even 3:1. You may use a sell limit or buy limit if you are afraid of missing out on the entry.  
  
I wouldn't deny that they will be missed opportunities due to the price not retracing to fibo 61.8/50.0. After all, every trader has a different money management system.   
  
Cheers. Stay green.

Hello Mate  
  
This stratergy is for H4, but about the rules, you are on the right track. Just take note the TP level is Fibo 200 level, which make every trade 1:1.

One more question in addition with previous one  
according to rules when a trade touched 150 fib first it retraces upto your entry and then hit your tp at 200 if you are brake even on touching 150 level then after throwing you out from trade it hits your tp and this scenario is occurring on 60% trades.  
My question is are you still go to brake even on touching 150 or not beacuse i want to exactly fallow your rules without any amendments.

The strategy is interesting, made a couple of euros of it. The problem is what if you are busy and can't monitor all the charts, losing a great opportunity when it comes.  
  
So the solution is I made an EA that monitors all the pairs in the market, major, minors, exotic or metals, and send me a notification through my phone, so that I can verify it and trade it.  
  
  
Good job on the strategy.  
  
Note: Always consider also if there are news within that time, because anything can happen. Happy Trading.

That could mean in short term the market is bearish but doesnt present the overall trend. You can follow as per rule and move on or look at bigger picture and decide

My question is are you still go to brake even on touching 150 or not beacuse i want to exactly fallow your rules without any amendments.

This is actually optional for more conservative traders. You can test either SL or TP and share your results?

I just do a manual backtest and apply it to demo account for 4 days. I removed the ema 30 and just using trendline to see where the trend is. I think it's more win than loss. Sometimes signal occurred where price above ema 30 but in downtrend and finally ended up loss. Just give a suggestion to make this system better and more win rate.

Tom

I'm sorry, I'm not a programmer, I do not know in MT4. Is MT4 better now? Is there any idea how to improve this strategy?

Here is a pullback not the strong momentum ...both works.I trade a method very similar but with different criteria.Here is the engulfing over the 30ema.I have allready covered on both postions.

My apologies if this was clearly addressed already. (please link for me).  
I understand an engulf requires higher high, and lower low than previous candle.  
Are people here requiring candle close to be lower than the previous candle low, or just lower than the previous candle body to confirm an engulf? (for short).  
  
Thx.

The way it is being traded is if high and low of last closed candle is higher and lower than previous candle then enter on the open of next candle.  
Do not concern yourself with bodies of candles only wicks or highs and lows.

MT4 is just more commonly used by traders that MT5 that you made EA for this strategy to run under it, I thought since you made this expert to run using MT5 platform, you can also code it to run under MT4, if some one else did it, can you please ask him to make version that run under MT4?, thank you

very nice man, thank you for this, can you or know some one can develop good expert advisor for this strategy?, it will be nice and useful, since we also can test it on smaller time frames and optimize it with many variables like moving average settings

In this thread they trade engulfing outside bar: the high/low of last bar completely engulf previous bar. In your case only the body of the last bar engulf the body of previous bar. So isn't a correct setup.

Does anyone know if there is a way to set up an email alert when these rules occur? I've got forex's alert and it's great when I'm home on my desktop. However like the original poster I have a day job t It be great if there was a way to see if we can set up an email alert on the engulf bar.so we could action. I know it's a but pointless for 4 hours but I think it be handy. Specially if the tests for the 1h turns out well.

I must be the dumbest guy in the world. It seems I can't get the Gulf indcator to work. I saved Forexs files in my MQ4 folder under EA. I also compiled and ran the indicator when i attach the EA to chart and add the indicator. I load the template, Yet when an egulf happens i dont seem to get an alert atm.

Hi All,  
  
Awesome strategy indeed.  
  
I've been trying it out for about a week now, but it seems like I just can't get it right - even coded an indicator according to the rules but there seems to be more losses than profit. Am I doing something wrong?  
  
Below is a few screenshots of how I understand this strategy and when I would enter trades.  
  
PS: I am getting the hang of using Fibonacci (in this particular strategy) after reading through some posts in the thread.

Simple Tip: Add Stoc with 8,3,3 settings, then wait for the new bar, because usually a retracement will happen after the engulfing bar is closed. Plot your fibo just like the instructions, and wait for the retracement around 61.8 or 50, then you can say that its a valid engulfing bar. Then trade it. Also refer to the support and resistance it might give you an idea where the trend will end.

This guy says that an engulfing bar in the middle of a trend is not engulfing. Engulfing needs to be either on top or bottom of a trend. If we apply ema30, it would almost be near impossible to see an engulfing bar that crosses it on top or bottom of a trend. But I guess, it is ok. An engulfing bar in the middle of a trend can also mean a continuation of the trend. We are not looking for reversal but rather a continuation of the trend. Just my thought. Unless you use a more hugging ( smaller) ema like ema8 which you can possibly see it cross right on top or bottom of a trend. I guess engulfing bar are usually used to predict a reversal of trend and that is what this guy is talking about.

Done for the week!  
The last couple of weeks I've tested different timeframes, but with bad result.  
This week I've sticked to H4 on 12 different pairs and worked wonders!  
2 of the loses were my own fault, due to bad entry.

Just below body is fine. If below the low show strong bearish but market can still retrace at the next candle even on strong bearish trend

Yes, if yoy read most articles, they wrote engulf pattern as a sign of reversal, thus most strategy will ask you to long at support (for bullish engulf) and short at resistance (for bearish engulf). That is mostly for counter-trend traders.  
  
This is my hypothesis that using engulf pattern on trend continuation may be more profitable. However it is still on testing.

Right now, EU is on a support zone in Daily. GU have a better position to take a trade (in daily is making a new LL LH, changing trend hopfully).

Hello [hzs10](https://www.forexfactory.com/hzs10),   
  
I just want to thank you for starting this thread and sharing your system. I must say that this is also very effective and I am here also to contribute and give back because I've seen this has a good potential.  
  
I believe being in a public forum, we are not just here to take ideas from others, but it is also our responsibility to share our knowledge to help each other out coz I believe in good karma... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f600.png?v=15.1)  
  
Anyway, with my very first post, I am sharing my trade that I am holding for the weekend using the trend following rules you mentioned in this thread..

As for me, I am following the original strategy idea to the T except that I am selective on the engulfing bar I take. It must have a follow up action, that is the next bar or the following bars closing above the high of the engulfing bar. It helps me not to over trade and not to take all engulfing bar as a signal bar. You can do a back test and see if you agree. Also, make sure that we do not buy into a resistance zone and sell into a support zone. Look at your higher time frame, eg daily to see that it is not blocked.

Just like what has been discussed by the Thread Starter, different time frames has been tested already and the highest probability of success is using 4H chart.   
But of course, you're always welcome to try and test it out for you to find out... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f600.png?v=15.1)

I agree with mizi. Also you need to understand to start truly an engulfing bar will look like In a week if you have a lot of ccy pairs up You may get 10-15 max that fit the criteria You need to be carful as well  
  
For example is engulfed but is it near a support zone, and is does it go with the trend correctly . Also has there been news that can effect these and most importantly if it id truly engulfing.I don't go for the engulfing bar unless the body engulfs the other candles my shadow cover its shadow. This will limit me to a handful of trades on the A 4h chart a week But I believe it gives the best result The op is an experienced trader. She has her rules but she also has something which people forget when looking at systems. Common sense. Too many people forget this, they see systems making good returns. But don't understand the thinking behind the originator of the system.

Same as AUDUSD short this week. Engulfing followed by another confirmation bar that closed below the low of engulfing. LH and LL can be seen also in daily. Follow me at your risk.

You say youyou are following the op stratsgies to the T But doesn't this go against it? If you are waiting for other bar isn't it eating the profits?

Yes I agree with this. Do not trade and use money that you cannot afford to lose. You have to make sure that you have stable income first before embarking on a trading journey... You don't want to be emotional when a trade is not working because that's the worst state that a trader can be in...

Don't give up and remember good attitude and positive mindset is greatly needed in this industry for you to succeed..  
  
Also hard work and perseverance... If trading is so easy, everyone will be rich already, but it is NOT! So, you really need dedication and will to survive.

Hello tejt,  
  
If your computer is slow/old go to your local library or friends and use theirs for research. Educate yourself... costs you only time yet gains knowledge which IMO is more valuable than $$ at this time for you.DO NOT use your living $$$ to trade or gamble.  
  
Find another source of income you can save $$$ dedicated for trading forex. When your trading account savings reach $300 minimum ($500 better) only then consider opening a live account. Trade 1(one ) pair that has low margin like $20/ 0.01 micro lot (depending on your leverage), do not risk more than 2% of your account and slowly build it up to 5x starting balance, then reward yourself with a withdrawal of 1%.( $300 x 5 = $1500 = $150 pat yourself on the back for job well done)  
  
By then you should be more knowledgeable and have practiced demo to gain confidence to go live. This is a mental game I have been in & out of many times, but have been able to hold my own. I am only part time trading & working for a living.  
  
Hopefully my advice above gets you thinking. It's free and meaningless...unless you act on it...you decide what works for you.  
  
Stay focused, determined, persevere and you will succeed.  
  
Cheers,  
Axleman.

NZDJPY has opposite signal now and you shouldn´t have shorted it in the first place because the price was ABOVE the 30 EMA. Now is the time to go LONG NZDJPY.

I have a suggestion on how we can use different lot size for this trade...  
  
Instead of using fixed lot size, once we determine our SL and TP for the trade, we calculate our risk using lot size calculator ([https://www.myfxbook.com/forex-calcu.../position-size](https://www.myfxbook.com/forex-calculators/position-size)) and it's up to you if you want to risk 1% or max of up to 3% (depending on your account size) only to always be safe, base your calculations on the projected SL, so you only lose very small, if wrong... But can profit bigger, if right...

Excellent entry GU went for about 140 pips ,I think once your target achieved protect the order and possible leave profits to run if modified SL hit you could still be happy,never know what extra bearish/bullish power the market can bring. I now short CADJPY - 6am candle :-)

I closed off the trade took small profit,price making higher highs and higher lows,uptrend still in progress,we just had a pullback/retracement. We can now look for the next bullish engulfing candle and do analysis.

Agree with you, that´s why I put my TP just in the demmand zone and no hold longer than that...

Hi,  
  
I am aware of the "Failed to delete button" error and know that it does not effect the performance in any way. I am not sure as to the effect of "zero divide error".  
  
Personally I am unable to remove both these errors. I invite other knowledgeable coders to try and figure out these errors and perhaps also improve the coding so as improve speed if possible.

Why strong buy? Not per the rules of THIS system at least. On H4, price is below EMA30 on all of them, no engulfing bar either. Just a news spike for now that might get quickly reversed. This AIN`T any kind of strong buy as per what this system here is, they are all still in sell mode as per the rules. As for me, I am out with a small loss on all my JPY sell trades, watching M5 right now until it peaks out, then going in short once again with a better entry price than before closing those. That´s they way such fake spikes / breakouts need to be addressed.

I'm just referring to what my currency strength meter is saying on MT4 ,not taking any trades of course.i wait on 2am est and probably sleep after then look for any possible engulfing later on,simple system,no indis needed just PA speaks.

You should have mentioned that along with your "STRONG BUY" comment, as this thread is about a specific system, such posts help no one and might mislead other people into buying although THIS system clearly has no buy signals for any of the pairs you´ve mentioned.

Hi Kirinda, is just a PA. You saw a HH formed and then you wait for the candles react an important zone (S&R) then go if you have a candle formation like the engulfing one, in my case I have another formation that told me to get into the trade but that candle formation is not an issue of this thread so I will not mentioned.

Whew! Just finished reading entire thread. Some very good thoughts. Thanks to all. A special thanks to hzs10 for excellent thread management!  
  
My current research (which is not extensive yet) shows a correlation between candle size and win/loss ratio. Generally speaking, candles much larger than average are not a good play. At this point it looks like 2 of 3 mongo bars are losers. If you find something different, please let me know.  
  
• Add ATR to chart to determine average candle size. Check far back in history. At least 3 years but not more than 5, due to more robust PA, prior to 2013. Once you have this figure for current pair, decide on maximum candle size you want to risk.  
  
• Add "Momentum Candles v1.ex4" to chart, and size to your specs.  
\------- This indicator has only 2 settings, besides color.   
1\. "candlepipvalue" This refers to candle real body.  
2\. "hilowpipvalue" This is total candle size, wick to wick.  
  
Default color is Magenta set to size 5. This makes my eyeballs bleed, so changed to white 2 or 3, depending on which shows up more clearly, without hiding actual candle body.  
  
Good pippin'

One other thing, this site goes into depth on candles, candle patterns, etc. The engulfing bar is fairly accurate overall. This site also has the book (ratings) on almost any formation you can name.

I dont see any engulfing candle... this is not an entry in my rule book but perhaps you have a different take on it :-)

There currently is no short entry on GBPUSD as per this system´s rules. Whatever you are doing there, it has nothing to do with this system. Any discussions should be kept to this system only, there are enough other places if you want to discuss your generic GBPUSD trades, based on other entry methods / systems. Let´s keep this thread clean, it only confuses new readers if you post such wrong entries here, as they have nothing to do with this system.

It's an expert adviser.   
  
For those you are asking what is this EA, it is an EA that scans the market for any Bullish/Bearish engulfing pattern, then send it to my mobile phone in a form of notification.   
Let's just say its like a Semi-Automatic system, that allows me to analyze the market better because I don't have enough time to look to the charts all day, and I really hate sitting down and watching the market.

Sure. Its up to you. I am just scanning H1 to check if my EA is running properly at my PC. But usually I trade only the H4 signals.

Thanks! Great work. I have been testing your dashboard! But the dashboard does not Highlight all the pairs where an engulfing arrow appears. Can you pls fix this?

yes, for me the real body of engulfing candle should be no more than two times bigger than previous candles body, but that's me!

Bad week for this system as it seems - apart from the nice GBPUSD short which lasted over the weekend, I have had only losers so far (apart from a few very small winners). Each time the signal came and entered, the market goes the other direction afterward. Right now there are also a lot bad ones. Seems like this system ain´t working right now. Is it the same for everybody else or just me?

I don’t know but it seems working for me for this week. Except for the GBP losses yesterday. Which I believe GBP pairs tend to do wild swings first before going in the right direction. That is why this system might not work always coz of the tight SL that we have to put using this system. That is why I decided to avoid all GBP pairs for now...  
  
Even for exotics and metals with not so wide spread can be possible... NOKJPY and XAGUSD

Has anyone found any signal yet? NZDUSD will finish with a Bullish Engulfing, but it's too close to a major resistance to long it.  
USDCAD is also about to finish with Bearish Engulfing but too close to the EMA too

I think the reason most are failing on this is they do not know when to enter or recognise a proper engulfing trades

Don´t think so much, because I know how engulfing bars look and I have an indicator which highlights them. Still, almost all trades are losses. See my trades from today, strictly by the rules, but all of them hit SL:

-eurgbp was on support, dont sell into support  
-cadchf, same thing, at bottom of range on support.  
-eursgd, on support  
-usdczk, looked like a decent setup but is inside a wedge pattern on 4hr, should wait for this to break.  
-eurhkd, on support  
-eurusd, looks decent, i also traded it and got stopped out, thats just trading not going to win 100%  
-sekjpy, is choppy with no direction, should leave it alone.  
-nokjpy, on support.  
  
should try trading the majors and some minors, stretching yourself to thin across all the currency pairs just makes it harder. focus on only the best setups. Learn some price action to go along with the strategy, but don't just blindly follow along then claim the system doesn't work because you haven't grasped it yet.

I follow your comment fxlrich. Don't go arround catching any engulfing candle, go with the trend...follow HH HL , LH LL ...learn PA and then and just then come back and tell us that this sistem don't Work.   
eurhkd and Eurusd you sell the engulfing candle when price is making HH HL.

I am well aware about that (been trading for 15 years), but I am talking about the PLAIN original system and it´s rules, which are:  
  
\- engulfing bar & price below 30 EMA: sell  
\- engulfing bar & price above 30 EMA: buy  
  
Nothing within those rules says to check support & resistance, other indicators, or whatever. What I am saying is that this system is NOT working as described and ONLY if you go and interpret other things into the market, which means you can basically use any other system as well, as it has no edge without further interpretations by the trader. Without that, this is a failing system as one can also easily see by the EA that has been developed for this, unfortunately.

Hi Geek trader  
as you have posted 8 charts and it all seems clear that none of the following candles after the engulfing bar close below the low of your engulfing bar for a sell. If you have taken only when the next bar shows a close below the low, I believe it stands a chance of winning. For example, if you see a pin bar on top of a rising trend do you just enter on the next bar without caring what the next price action is going to be? You surely want to see a confirmation or a follow up as I mentioned. I have been talking to the author about this on the side and my purpose is not to add confusion. But if you enter just seeing an engulfing you are in for a serious shock. This is just my take and hope you people do not misunderstand me for adding unnecessary filter. But friend, step back and think again. Even if it is another 4 hour bar wait and you think you are late by one bar so be it as long as it give me the confidence I am ok.  
If you see Trinquete methods, he uses his own filter by seeing HH and HL before he confidently enters a buy. That just his style but I think it is a rational approach which I myself is trying to incorporate also.My usdyen sell chart is enclosed as an example. It is still has not reach TP as I write

If you want to follow the rules as per post 1...then you need to do you're own due diligence, hzs10 has told you what pairs she chooses to trade.  
If you look at my post on post 77 you will see that I visually tested a lot of pairs, some as far back as 5 years, and chose to trade the ones with a high win percentage (which is what you need for this method to work profitably)  
I trade this on daily TF. You will have to do all that work on the 4hr, no shortcuts in life...enjoy.

I have no reasons to defend this strategy. But this is what happened. I randomly picked GBPCHF (because I happened to be on this chart when this idea came up) and I did a manual backtest. I do not know how MT4 can let you backtest automatically. If that is possible.  
So during this 6 months of back test from Nov 2018 till May 2018, my back test shows that there were 21 wins and 5 losses. Of course, I used my filter as mentioned in my earlier post. I do not just picked any engulfing bar.

I don't know if this system working only based on the rules on page 1, but I'm sure that you can not tell if a system work or not based on a couple of bad days ([hzs10](https://www.forexfactory.com/hzs10) tells on page 1 that she testing the system and I guess she is not finish with that yet).  
  
The system need to be tested over a couple of months with many trades. I'm also sure that the entry method is good and a newbie can use this system and learn to filter out trades with for examples:  
\- The slope of the 30EMA in the same direction as the entry and not flat  
\- The body of the engulfing candle should at least be 2/3 of the candle and the close of the candle should be in the same direction as the entry  
\- The entry should be taken at swing point in the same direction as the trend  
\- Check if HH,HL,LL, LH are in the same direction as 30EMA. This can also be an alternative to 30EMA.  
  
For newbie I do not think you need incorporate support and resistance because it make the strategy more complex using it from a mobile phone, it's take time to learn and for this startergy it's not so important (the startergy move SL to BE fast).

Not saying it works or not, but just looking quickly at your charts, i think i spotted more wins than losses, according to the basic rules (outside bars & slope of EMA)  
people are trading basic things differently. so what doesnt work for you might work for someone else.

Show me the other rules of the system creator then. Her post is here <https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=824888> and it says:  
  
1\. Add EMA 30  
2\. Follow the trend  
3\. Look for engulf pattern. The high/low of the current bar need to cover the high/low of previous bar.  
4\. Enter at the next open bar.  
5\. Long when PA above EMA 30, and short when PA below EMa 30  
6\. Use Fibo to determine SL and TP  
  
So where are more rules from the ORIGINAL creator of this system that I have not followed?

She also said : Dont trade every engulf bar.  
She has the experience to trade this method and win,so you can not trade blindly every engulf bar.

... And so this system is not a system, sorry. As soon as second guessing is required in addition to the system rules to make it successful, it is a plain fail for me, as it misses the point of a system that can be traded "as is". It simply is not a winning system in the long run - all the backtests of the EA for that system show that. ONLY if you are an experienced trader you can POSSIBLY make money with it, but again, that is not a real "mechanical" system then.

I think we are here not to judge the system right away. I think we can also do our part to make the system better by testing it and at the same time, we can contribute here to make it better.  
  
We just don't enter blindly IMHO we also have to check PA and I am posting this trade for today to say that the 4 hour engulfing candle can also be effective for counter trend trade.

I said those are not the only rules. It was true so you have added some more. There's no need to get peevish. Have you also included moving your stop loss?

If you have taken only when the next bar shows a close below the low, I believe it stands a chance of winning. For example, if you see a pin bar on top of a rising trend do you just enter on the next bar without caring what the next price action is going to be? You surely want to see a confirmation or a follow up as I mentioned. I have been talking to the author...

Good result, simple and clean strategy. Just the strategy on my phone with MT4..pay attention on daily TF, draw S&R, back to 4H TF, look for engulfing candle, above 30 EMA buy, below 30 EMA sell.   
  
Thanks!

I tried this system in 1 week, and it shows great probability of winning trades, and also by far this was the most simple way of trading i've found here.  
Honestly i i havent read this thread throughly, but some ppl already add some rules to the basic rules, its okay cause different ppl trade different ways as long as u follow the basic rules.  
  
As for me, i add this following rules :  
1\. I only trade outside engulfing candle  
2\. I dont trade engulfing candle that has size 2 times or more than the previous candle  
4\. Trade when pa below or above ema, (ema line wasnt inside the candle)  
5\. Only trade on trending market, not ranging market.  
  
I dont use support n resistence, check higher tf, checking news, etc bcause imo it will kill the simplicity of this system.  
I already have indi that show outside engulfing candle that send notification, i will share it here when i got back from my trip.  
  
Cherrs.. 

Okay... sorry about my messed up English Tenses

> {quote} Hi Geek trader as you have posted 8 charts and it all seems clear that none of the following candles after the engulfing bar close below the low of your engulfing bar for a sell. If you have taken only when the next bar shows a close below the low, I believe it stands a chance of winning. For example, if you see a pin bar on top of a rising trend do you just enter on the next bar without caring what the next price action is going to be? You surely want to see a confirmation or a follow up as I mentioned. I have been talking to the author...

Hi folks  
Some very good news to tell you. You can choose to believe me. If not, do your own back test and reaffirm. Today I did manual back-test for 4 pairs. This is how I did it.  
It is testing back from today till 1/5/2018 (6 months worth). All test are based on H4 TF. Engulfing that has no confirmation, I dropped it.  
I only take engulfing with follow through both bullish and bearish engulfing above and below ema30. Prices that did not reach fibo 200, I considered loss. I don't considered a win if it only reach fibo 150. Prices that reach fibo 200, I considered TP. My stop loss is not exactly at 0. It is at least 10 pips higher or lower as that's how I normally trade.   
I did this with objectivity and no bias whatsoever. If it is a win, its a win. If its a loss, its a loss. Good test as moving average in MT4 does not repaint.  
**RESULT**  
**NZDUSD- WIN 19 LOSS 3**  
**CHFYEN WIN 28 LOSS 5**  
**EURUSD WIN 23 LOSS 7**  
**USDCAD WIN 24 LOSS 6**  
  
**what can we say about this strategy? Lets open to the floor for discussion.**

That is good news indeed and with very good results...  
  
My question is what about your entries? Where do you usually enter if you are waiting for the second candle follow through? You still put a limit order and wait for the price to go back to 100% fibo level?

Great results as well.. Does all of these trades were exitted on 200% fibo or some are at 150% or manual close?

Hey buddies  
I enclosed two chart. The first chart is a legitimate entry. I normally only enter after the bar after the engulfing **closed** to confirm it actually close below the low of the previous engulfing bar. I do not put pending order. I still draw the fibo on the engulfing bar not the next bar (confirmation bar).  
  
As for the second chart, this engulfing is ignore as the next bar does not close below the low of the engulfing. You see this pattern keep repeating. If it does not close below the low, it often than not is a losing trade as you see price going higher.  
  
I no need to cherry pick. It is every where and keeps repeating. You just need to open your eyes and discern.   
  
I hope it answers your question. Can someone back test another pair and report result? Today? To be consistent, please incorporate my method.

Another engulfing that failed the test. I do not take this engulfing into my test. You see the bars that follows did not close below the low. You see prices goes the opposite.  
  
I do not have to find so hard to substantiate my case. You just need to looked back your charts and it is popping out before your eyes.

Another failed engulfing USDCHF. See chart  
You can see next to the failed engulfing is one that I took in. The bullish engulfing followed by confirmation and reached fibo 200. So my point is  
do not take engulfing that has no confirmation. There are so many that has so why take the risk.  
From yesterday test it is 94 wins and 21 loss out of just 4 pairs that is about 20% losses and 80% wins estimated? If that is the case out of 10 trades you will lose only 2. Set and forget and let it run till fibo 200.   
  
Backested usdchf from may 1 till today  
  
**RESULT**  
**WIN 21 LOSS 3**

In this case, the next candle close above of the engulfing candle, showing a good setup of your analisis, but didn't retrace to take the trade. Can explain please, to understand where you take the trade?

I enter after the confirmation bar to see that it really close above the engulfing bar in the example you brought up. If it does not, I ignore it.  
Please see chart. Hope it answers your question. Are you ok to test another pair? Or you can take my test and reconfirm if your figure is close to mine? Thanks

Hi Trinquette  
I simply enter on the next candle after the confirmation. Don't care about retrace etc. Pure and simple. This one reached fibo 200 even though I am late/ Hope it answers. If not post again.

> Another failed engulfing USDCHF. See chart You can see next to the failed engulfing is one that I took in. The bullish engulfing followed by confirmation and reached fibo 200. So my point is do not take engulfing that has no confirmation. There are so many that has so why take the risk. From yesterday test it is 94 wins and 21 loss out of just 4 pairs that is about 20% losses and 80% wins estimated? If that is the case out of 10 trades you will lose only 2.

just came back from my jog. What do you mean inside and outside engulfing candle? An engulfing is aka outside bar, not sure what you men inside bar.  
  
In candlestick, inside bar is a complete different pattern, usually inside a mother bar. Please explain what you mean inside engulfing candle.  
  
This week, I am going to enter USDNOK sell as this chart show. I may win or I may lose. No 100%. But after doing the back test, its give me more confidence to just do it. You guys should do the same. At least you do the test yourselves you feel more confident. The beauty of this back-test is price do not repaint and so is MA. So there is no cheating. Not like zigzag indicator or semifor.. It repaints to give you a false hope when you back-test and every entry seems to be a winner.  
  
As for usdnok this week, follow at your own risk. The rules are the same just that there is confirmation bar. I did not see whether there is HH or HL (Trinquete method) as I think this strategy can also do counter trend. My back test showed you earlier on does not care if it is with trend or counter trend and it seems like it does not matter.  
  
Trinquete, we are waiting for your test result. Chop chop...

Just tested AUDUSD from May 1 2018 till today. **RESULTS WIN** -**20** **LOSS** -**4**  
  
It gives me confidence that I can simply random pick any pair and the result are overwhelmingly positive. That leaves us one question.  
**QUESTION:**  
If back test shows 80% wins, why does it not translate to the same wining result when we actually trade? What is wrong?

> The strategy is interesting, made a couple of euros of it. The problem is what if you are busy and can't monitor all the charts, losing a great opportunity when it comes. So the solution is I made an EA that monitors all the pairs in the market, major, minors, exotic or metals, and send me a notification through my phone, so that I can verify it and trade it. Good job on the strategy. Note: Always consider also if there are news within that time, because anything can happen. Happy Trading. {image}

Vianiah, is it possible to get us copy of this Ea. It's like it highlights which chart to tend to as alerts are being sent out on time. Kindly share with the group. Cheers

Hi folks  
who want to take this trade when Monday comes. USDCAD sell H4 TF. It has every thing, below ema30, engulfing and a confirmation bar. Remember the backtest shows 24 wins only 6 losses. That's 75% probability you win.

Hi  
I need to say that during my back test there are many instances whereby 2 qualified engulfing bar set up happens very close along the same trend. I have to count it as 2 wins although it is unlikely any traders will enter another long when his first long has not tp. Maybe you look at my chart. See the two candles with yellow arrow marked.  
  
Just tested USDSGD H4TF May 1 till today (6 months)  
  
**RESULT**  
**WIN- 24, LOSS-7**

thanks ahgang.  
The best is the next bar confirms the engulfing so that it does not affect your R:R ratio. I noticed that it still works if the confirmation bar comes 2 or 3 bars after engulfing but best is the next bar so that you are not too far away. Don't just believe what I say. Do your test. thanks

Engulfing Confirmation  

The confirmation of the Engulfing candles comes with the candle**after the pattern**. **_It needs to break the body level of the engulfing_** candle to confirm the validity of the pattern.

A bullish pattern continues only with a third candle (bullish), which breaks the body of the engulfing candle . A bearish pattern continues with a third candle (bearish), which breaks the body of the engulfing downwards. See picture to see the confirmation.

If you still insist on entering just seeing an engulfing, good luck. You can don't follow, its entirely up to you. Its your money. You can see why our earlier guy who posted 8 charts and asking why the price went the other way every time he enters. I think he had signed out already from this forum. I am not saying this is 100% holy grail. Nothing is. My purpose is avoid us barking up the wrong tree. Just be polite if you disagree.

Thanks reisei  
  
I try to be selective. If a body is small with long upper and lower wicks that engulf the previous bar, I would not take a chance. If I see a whole body engulf the whole body of the previous candle, it is a bonus. No need to see whether the wicks cover the previous bar or not. I also do not take engulfing that has very long body, eg the GBP that drops like crazy last Friday or Thursday. Its also affects your R:R if you take that trade.

Hi Ahgang  
can you do a longer backtest. say 6 months its takes you about 15 min for each pair. If I am not wrong, I see H1 TF in there as well. Also SL is not exactly at 0 as some volatile ccy can wicksaw and wipe you out if you stay at 0. I usually have 10-15 pips more for SL. Also I noticed that your fifth slides on your winning trade why you did not consider a win at the engulfing bar right below the chart. As I have said, two setups along the same trend I consider as 2 wins.  
  
Lets see what Trinquete comes up with.

Hello Mate  
  
No problem for that,i stop because the SL seems occur alot and not like your results all less than 10SL. I worried due to i dont understand your method.  
As for SL placement, i think only 2 to 3 trades with tolerance 15pips placement doing the job well to keep away. Mostly SL occur due to trend changed.  
And please confirm my entry method is it close to your defination?

Thanks Ahgang, I need someone else to validate my test. I may be wrong or see things I not suppose to see. This is not concrete yet that's why I need Trinquete to help me. Thanks. Please do a longer test and maybe test nzdusd as well. Test from today till 1/5/2018. See if your figure comes out different.

Hi Ahgang  
just wondering why you did not include this bearish engulfing. As I have said, setup along the same trend I consider as 2. I think some you did not take in but I do. You can see a lot of setup along the same trend.

This one I saw and counted as one of the loss. According to my count Jun1 to Aug 31 there are 11 wins and 4 losses. I counted twice and I get the same figure. That's is 64% and for these short two months is still a respectful result if you manage your R:R ratio properly. Does longer time gives different result? I don't know, that's why we can find out.  
  
Please refer to my word doc to show you why you did not count some of the winning trades along the same trend. There are a lot you missed out, I think.  
  
If you ask me why I count two setup within the same trend since no trader is going to buy or sell twice when his first trade has not tp I really have no answer. But I guess the test is to show that if presented with a valid engulfing no matter how many times, how many will turn up win and how many will turn up loss assuming you take in all valid engulfing bar.

hi TradeForexFx,  
  
You could add email alert like this: on your HZS_Engulfing Bar DB v2.mq4:  
  
at the top of the code, where you are declaring variables:  
extern string Alert_every_n_Min_Bar_ = "1,5,15,30,60,240 are valid entries";  //This bit is already there!  
extern bool SendEmailAlert = false;  // Here I am declaring a variable to allow users to toggle the switch  
  
  
At the bottom of the code, where you are sending the pop-ups. (approx line 4222)  
  
if(PopUp_Alert){   
string Message;  
  
if ( TradePair_1_Color != Aqua)  
{  
Message = "Possible Engulfing Bar: "+TradePair_1+" M "+Period();  
if (PopUp_Alert) Alert(Message);   
if (SendEmailAlert) SendMail(Message,""); //New Line: This bit sends the email.  
Sleep (1000);  
  
}  
  
The format of the SendMail command are SendMail(subject,text) where subject is email subject header, and text is the email body. (check the MQL4 Reference manual)  
  
hope this can guide you. Its not that complex. Getting users to configure their platform to send emails is where problems happen! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

i don't know exactly,what is is, but it seems to be different as mine...  
please look at the pictures, my fibo has r:r 1:1,the distance from 0 to 100 is equal to the distance between 100 and 200...  
so, my r:r is <1 as soon as i enter the trade 1 pip lower than fib 100...  
hope, you understand it...

Hi sam69  
  
mot sure too. I think my fibo some thing wrong. But I have being TP at 200 no problem. But your 200 and my 200 is 20 pips difference. But not to worry I think because if I am not accurate in where I start (o fibo_ then the 200 will be different price. I think that's how it works.

hmm, my question was because of r:r...  
if we enter after confirmation then our risk is greater than reward...  
but anyway, thanks for the answer!

You are absolutely right. There is no way you can have your cake and eat it. Its either you want to be sure before you enter and lose some points or you need to manually adjust the SL and TP to suit your 1:1 ratio. But I always bring my BE to 100 once price hit 150 fibo and it helps a lot except for one trade GBPCHF I move to 100 and it got stop out If I have remained above 0 and not move to 100 I would have TP eventually. This is fx and there is always surprises.  
  
Oh... you can draw your fibo on the confirmation bar not engulfing. would that make a difference?

Hi Ahgang  
  
see my post 1282. Hope it helps. Again your perception of EB may be different from mine. Even if engulf the whole of previous but just a bit not engulf I may take it but you may not.  
  
If you look at the chart I showed you, the bottom body completely engulf the bottom of previous and the top body is about the same or slightly higher.In this case I left the wick out.

some quick, simple, easy to follow rules iv made for myself over the weekend, still got more testing to do but thought it might be useful to some of you.  
These are just from the past couple weeks, if you want to do more back testing (which i suggest ) you'll find these aren't just selective trades , these set ups happen often just gotta be patient.

> Another failed engulfing USDCHF. See chart You can see next to the failed engulfing is one that I took in. The bullish engulfing followed by confirmation and reached fibo 200. So my point is do not take engulfing that has no confirmation. There are so many that has so why take the risk. From yesterday test it is 94 wins and 21 loss out of just 4 pairs that is about 20% losses and 80% wins estimated? If that is the case out of 10 trades you will lose only 2.

First of all, I would like to thank hzs10 for sharing this system.  
  
josephkee, congratulations you realize the important problem in the system, I think that the engulfing signal and ma is not completely successful alone, I need another system to verify the engulfing signals. I've been thinking about this problem for a few days and I've tried a few other indiators and if I can, I'll try the PIN code for Dashboard EAX. I can't complete it yet, I hope I can.

In my personal opinion i think the system works well as is, you will always lose selling at the bottom of a trend and buying at the top, same with every strategy, because it's impossible to predict the end of a trend, but if you follow this systems rules you would have come out a winner overall with 10 wins 4 losses and few break evens

I cant wait to see this PIN on dashboard EAX..  
  
Im going to forward test, this system for a month, because im not used to back test with trading system. But looking back for a few weeks, to some pairs, i can say this system have about 70% winning probability. The fact that i can use it on my mobile device is really a big bonus.  
  
Just for reminder, op says that she still testing this system, so i really hope that we can complete this system 

Okay... sorry about my messed up English Tenses

Also SL is not exactly at 0 as some volatile ccy can wicksaw and wipe you out if you stay at 0. I usually have 10-15 pips more for SL. Also I noticed that your fifth slides on your winning trade why you did not consider a win at the engulfing bar right below the chart. As I have said, two setups along the same trend I consider as 2 wins. Lets see what Trinquete comes up with.

Hi Ahgang, you dont put fibo in the right spot in the loosing trades, you must yo take 0 and 100 level in the same candle that start everithing (the engulfing candle).

But looking at your chart, I would not have taken the two engulfing on the extreme left (red arrow). It has no follow through and since I do not take it I would not consider that a loss. Thanks anyway.

Trinquete  
I just noticed that too. The Fibo 0 and fibo 100 should be on the same engulfing candle. I do not see this happen in Ahgang chart. Also as I have mentioned earlier how I did the test, SL is never exactly at 0. If it is you are not giving allowance for wicksaw to happen. And it does happen. I would think 10 to 15 pips is safe. Ahgang SL is strictly at 0 and in real life trade you normally want to give allowance no matter how good you think of your set up. That is just my style and thus this is how I test it.

So, this is what I have if I will trade USDJPY starting 6 months from now (May 18)  
  
<https://www.tradingview.com/x/TZJukxw3/>  
  
(This was plotted on 4h chart of course, but I have to shrink to 6months time for the whole chart to be visible. So, don't mind the 120 Minutes TF)  
  
Please take note also that I take a counter-trend trade on some of the trades when there's an engulfing candle. I also base my trades on PA. So, definitely, I am not using the exact rules here but I added some of my own because that will enable me to take more possible trades.  
  
**have to edit, missed a few weeks in the middle**

So, don't mind the 120 Minutes TF) Please take note also that I take a counter-trend trade on some of the trades when there's an engulfing candle. I also base my trades on PA. So, definitely, I am not using the exact rules here but I added some of my own because that will enable me to take more...

Thanks Vince, 19 wins and 3 losses? That is even matter than my count. Does your win means tp at 200? Did you use EB confirmation bar before enter? Do you give allowance for SL? Vince, can you share your filter? It is now to Trinquete to give us tomorrow. Thanks everybody and good night.

Also as I have mentioned earlier how I did the test, SL is never exactly at 0. If it is you are not giving allowance for wicksaw to happen. And it does happen. I would think 10 to 15 pips is safe. Ahgang SL is strictly at 0 and in real life trade you normally want to give allowance no matter how good you think of your set up. That is just my style and thus this is how I test it.

So, very of that loosings trades must become a winners.

Actually, I edited the post. Missed sometimes in the middle.  
  
The final result:  
Duration: May 18 to Nov 18  
TOTAL TRADES: 38  
WIN:30  
BREAKEVEN: 2  
LOSE: 6  
  
<https://www.tradingview.com/x/TZJukxw3/>  
  
I give allowance on SL. I only counted Win those who reached 200%.  
Noticed I also have breakeven, so those are the trades that only reached 150%.   
Yes, I always use EB confirmation bar, remember I mentioned, I am using Price Action which means I always need confirmation...  
That is why I have counter trend trades also.  
Meaning even if the price is ABOVE 30EMA, if there's a sign that it will reverse, I take a short trade. And vice versa.  
  
What Filter do you mean that you want me to share?

By the instructions of josephkee, I saw just 1 loosing trade, and a few that you don't take because the next candle don't close above or below the engulfing candle

hi Josephkee,  
  
Is it worth describing the trades in terms of pips made in the 6 month test period?  
Because win/lose is meaningless unless understood in terms of potential money that can be made or lost and the risk to reward on each trade.

I saw in the charts that if you put fibo at 250 it will Work fine too, and increase R:R. But I have to do in my laptop, not in my Cel

Risk to reward is always 1:1

Thanks ste1878  
  
How do you interpret your finding? Is it good or bad? Since R:R is 1:1 can you let us know how many winners and how many losers. From the chart, I cannot tell as I am not familiar with this.

TP1 150%, I exited early some pairs because they don’t confluent with Daily TF. Thanks

GBPNZD 2018  
83 trades  
53 wins  
30 losses  
64% win rate  
total pips = 1493  
  
-Manually Back tested 1 bar at a time  
-Didnt take trades with a stop loss of +100 pips and also didn't add additional positions if a trade was already active, which if you wanted to would have bumped up the pip count quite a bit. But apart from that i used the original strategy posted by hzs10 ....  
-engulfing above 30ema buy, engulfing below 30ema sell,  
-SL 5 pips below signal candle, TP at fib level 200  
-SL moved to fib level 1 once price touched fib level 1.5  
  
Note: adding major Support and resistance would have filtered out some of the losers but you'd also miss some winners.  
  
Will be doing the rest of the pairs eventually for myself but if people are interested and want my stats uploaded i can do that.

Hello Mate  
  
I note that too. But if the confirmation bar is large,our RR will less than 1:1 if TP calculate base on engulfing but not confirmation, it will cause our RR become risky. Thats why i always prefer 1:1.  
  
I will proceed some pair with Josephkee technic, this round will calculate base on pip instead of just win lose. Its to eliminate small win big lose in term if pip.

Hi Ahgang  
if you look at your chart you posted, the first lost trade would have tp at fibo 200 if your fibo was correctly drawn. Your 100 fibo seems to be on top of another bar next to the engulfing. thanks

Yeah this is only the first pair, hoping to back test 1 pair a day so in a few weeks i'll know for sure which pairs have the highest win rate and will stick to those

Hello Mate  
  
We must not focus on how many TP we can get. If your TP always smaller than SL, this is base on confirmation bar but refer to engulfing bar to calculate TP,it is possible you may win 2 trades but lose all when 1 trade SL.  
  
For me if want to exam this confirmation method, pip gains is the one more accurate instead just by win lose number.  
  
Just my 2 cents.  
  
Example trade below  
We are using 74pips SL to win a 40 pips TP.

Hi   
you think is doable? If Vince stats for USDYEN says 30 wins and 6 losses and mine is 30 wins and 7 losses, does it mean then that if you take all valid engulfing bar (with confirmation) along the way, and over a six month period you will end up winner? That is to say along a trend, there are many many setups which turn up profitable. You will take the trade as it presented to you even if you have not tp the first one. Is this a crazy idea? If you think the money is not enough considering 6 months, then do 2 pairs over six months. Repeat throughout the 6 months.  
  
Fundamentally hzs10 rules has not change, just an idea. I have updated her on the side but no response from her as yet. Please politely tell me if I am wrong.  
  
Please see my chart for the setups along the trend where the most money is made.

I found this indicator for candle stick patterns a long time ago.  
  
Hope you can use this.

Engulfing bars on EURCAD, EURJPY, EURUSD. Check rules before entry - purely just pointing out what pairs have engulfings.

Hi Josephkee, Im worried about R:R, been testing and when the candle after the engulfing is the middle size of this one, the R:R is against us, not even 1:1, so this we have to Work it

Agree, I have spoken to Vince offline and he said the correct way is to put the fibo at Engulfing not Confirmation bar. Unless, if everyone agrees that confirmation bar is not important and you can live with a few unconfirmed (maybe five) out of 25 trades and accept that its going your wrong way and don't need confirmation then you just enter after the engulfing no matter what and hope for the best.That way, you can get R:R=1.  
  
Maybe Vince can confirm that the number of unconfirmed EB is not substantial in his test? How about you Trinquete?

Hi Joseph,  
  
My take is that confirmation bar is important. Also Price Action. You have to know what's exactly happening on the chart so that you don't enter blindly just because there's an engulfing candle. This system/strategy is really great where we wait for engulfing candles, for me this is my 1st qualification before analyzing the possible trade. Then I check other factors as well before going into the trade such as price location, pivot, s/r, trendline and I also check higher timeframe to check if it is the same direction.  
  
To have a good R:R, always enter at 100% fibo, if price already more than 100%, put a limit order, for sure price will retrace a little, just have to wait for your order to get filled. If price goes to TP, without you, then just move on to the next trade. Best to get a good entry price always, so get rid of FOMO.  
  
Just my few cents...  
Hope this helps...

Hello Mate  
At least we worried about the same issue. Purely talking about win and lose are meaningless. RR play an important part in forex. Never ever against the rule of thumb.

exactly, my concern always was that this 'entry after confirmation' thing, therefore i had a discussion with **josephkee** about his fib percentage but i'm still unsure how about risk, i think we have two options, either we enter without follow up bar with rr:1, or we have to define certain reward ratio...

Just for everyone's motivation that this system really works..   
  
Trading is not exact science. That is why we cannot always apply the rules. That is why money management and risk management is important for us to succeed. We trade to make profits. And at the end of the day, that's what matters the most. Not too much on stats just as long your equity is going up consistently, then you should be fine...

Okay let me try to explain. I always define the pip distance first from 100% to 0% but sometimes i add a few pips away depending on the price structure.   
  
Once I already know the pip distance i use position size calculator to determine the lot usage. I just make sure thay I only lose 1% max on per trade. For one pair, I can have 3 positions. One close on the 100% then stop order on 150% and limit order on 61.8% or even 50%. So, my total risk for one pair is between 1-3%. Sometimes if price did not retrace, I will only have two positions triggered. Remember the three orders does have different lot sizes because the risk% is always 1%.

Your mistake here is clear & simple. No engulfing (bullish) but still you entered even though it closed at 112.800+  
  
Now this is a candidate for short coz there's a bearish engulfing candle that just printed and now will be easier coz it's a trend following trade now. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

shorted.  
Actually i shorted when it breakout  
  
Josephkee bro. Your method of entry after engulfing confirmation candle (3rd candle) makes a lot of sense.  
The problem is 4H candle can be quite large, which will take away the profit.  
Have you tried on 1H? i did some backtest on 1H, slightly lesser hit rate but better RRR.  
Whats your view?

Hello there hope you're still trading I am just wondering who you are actually trading with and what is the size of the spread or the bet   
In other words if lets say the gbp/eur moves by £1 or by one euro and you traded that what is your return

I had a wrong wiew of the daily chart because price reach a supply zone (where I like to sell), well today was a bussy day and I make that mistake.

Yes getting users to configure their platform is where the problem begins..., I have been unable to setup emails properly and that is why I was not willing to introduce it in this indicator.  
  
Any ways (thanks to obiwandax) I have coded for email as well as push notifications. Push notifications, I understand, requires an account with MQL5.com - (for you to explore).  
  
I would like to post the update only after I have received some feed back of errors, if any in ver 2 of the indicator. The new update would be third post of this indicator and I do not want to clutter the forum with frequent changes.   
  
In the meanwhile, if someone could explore how to set up emails and push notifications, that would be nice. There are plenty of suggestions available out there, so, please post only the method that has been tried and tested by you, including the free email server that works. I want to try both types of alerts before I upload the latest update, as such, please do post a working procedure for both email as well as push notifications.

Just finished reading through this thread.   
  
  
Thank you so much to everyone for all the valuable input so far. I agree with the R:R ratio. I would always rather wait for a retrace back to 100 or maybe even 125 fibo. What i am thinking is, if you are in a trade after the confirmation candle, maybe add limit orders on the retracement of the actual engulfing candle. I haven't checked how many times this happened, but I will have a look and let you know.  
  
I am loving this thread! 

I am still a NOOB!!! Damn, there goes another 10 pips!

I was wondering what more experienced traders of this method thought about adding to a position where a second engulfing bar appears before the first has played out?

Concerning my earlier post regarding the fact that if an additional setup occurs during a trade of the same direction you can double (or more) the position size...Over 100s of trades across several pairs I have seen only 2 that did not work out.  
  
This was on daily TF not 4hr, probably similar

Hi Trinquete  
  
I saw D1 was lower high. See the two yellow arrows in my chart. Is this how you see your HH and HL? So I would not enter a buy at H4. In fact I sold based on the engulfing and turns up well.The trade is still in the running.

Hi Joseph, was a big mistake, didn't realize about LH, I saw a HH in 4h. Is not my way to trade, was a mistake.

Hi Joseph,  
  
That lower high is not an actual lower high yet. Depending on how you define your swings, lower high on daily time frame will be confirmed if and only if October 26th low is penetrated.

Thanks blackeagle. I attach the chart. Please tell me. I am completely lost. But I think take all valid engulfing bars that comes our way no matter counter trend or not. Because the statistics taken by me , I do not check back if it is counter trend or not. Like what cfudge says, it will turn up profitable in the long run.

Trinquete bro i think we made same mistake as a PA trader. We tend to look too far of the chart when we are only trading for the next few candles.  
I kept telling myself trade immediate trend trade immediate trend trade immediate trend! but i still analyse too much on higher timeframe  
Im trying to break this habit. Any tips?

Yes, I mean that. After that swing low is penetrated, then we can say that the chart shows LH and LL which is the definition for downtrend. But this has nothing to do with this method of trading as strategy is using a different method to determine the trend. If you trade all engulfing bars no matter what the trend is, it is your choice. I just wanted to point out how a trend is determined in terms of HH-HL or LH-LL.

There are many different methods to determine a trend, HH-HL and LH-LL, moving average slope, moving average crossover, trendline etc. Considering momentum is normally stronger with trend compared to a retracement, it is logical to trade engulfing bar as a continuation pattern especially since the strategy is looking for only RR 1:1. But one can also argue that engulfing bars are effective, too, as a reversal pattern. Therefore it is trader's choice to trade this strategy either in trend direction or trend - counter trend both.

Let me summarise  
  
For filter  
  
1) confirmation bar after EB  
2) higher high, higher low (immediate trend? or higher time frame) Trinquete  
3) let it retrace till 100 of eb before enter to achieve 1:1  
4) For me I want to see price is above ema 30 in daily time frame same as H4 before I enter on seeing confirmation bar? HH and HL in daily is too much own perception as for me, Using MA cuts out the subjectiveness.  
  
Is there any others?  
  
As for me, I am beginning to just enter any valid EB that comes my way for two pairs USDYEN and USDSGD. Wish me luck.

Mr Blackeagle  
are you saying just check the TF you are trading in this case H4? If price up take bullish eb if price is below ema take bearish eb?

Its either you want to be sure before you enter and lose some points or you need to manually adjust the SL and TP to suit your 1:1 ratio. But I always bring my BE to 100 once price hit 150 fibo and it helps a lot except for one trade GBPCHF I move to 100 and it got stop out If I have remained above 0 and not move to 100 I would have TP eventually. This is fx and there is always surprises. Oh... _**you can draw your fibo on the confirmation bar not engulfing.**_****...

ZackWj  
We need wise man like you around. Your comments jolt us back to reality and get us thinking because what you said make a lot of sense and prevents us from over analysing. Looking for higher high and high low before enters are subjective and you may perceive it to be so and I may not. And do you see current trend, D1, W1 or even monthly? It all boils down to how cautious you want to be before you enter. By the time you analysed everything the cow has already come home.  
My back test seems to tell me that "don't care, just take every valid EB, you will be alright and profitable". Wonder how many of you are with me. Thanks

Please go and sleep. I see you are still up. As for my result, you are wrong. it is at best mixed. I am still experimenting.  
Can some kind soul summarise and confirm what we have all discussed and lets conclude and go ahead to trade as per agreed.We need some time to see if it gives us good result after putting in filters.

Every time frame has its own trend. I have not back/forward tested the strategy, therefore I cannot comment on whether trading only H4 trend or checking the trend on D1 and taking trades on H4 gives more consistent results. Because the strategy is trying to take advantage of strong price momentum in trend direction, probably targeting TP level within a few bars, although lower time frame trends are noisier, it would be reasonable, in my opinion, to check H4 trend only for this strategy.

Dear Blackeagle  
I love to hear what you say and cut out unnecessary filtering. You are right that we are looking for a short swing to TP and counter trend cannot be wrong. Wonder why those gurus keep saying check higher TF for trend and do not go against it. Higher TF may tell you its uptrend but the lower TF like H4 can still goes down for a short period.  
Thanks

Different trading styles. Higher time frame trends are more reliable. Check out USDJPY daily chart below. Depending on what method you use to determine a trend, USDJPY Daily chart shows uptrend since April 5th. But if you check your H4 chart, you may see a couple of downtrends within this uptrend. Some prefer the reliability of daily or higher time frames and take trades from lower time frames for a better price, some prefer trading only one time frame, it is totally up to your trading style. We cannot say one style is better or worse.

Vince  
Good trade. I also have NZUUSD buy still running. In fact I have two positions because I was presented with two EB on the same trend. I also have sell USDyen and sell USDSGD have already entered 2 USDYEN and 2 USDSGD as it presented to me yesterday and this morning along same trend. I also see that distance of price is far away from the ema slope which tells me I should be safe to enter. I see that most money is made as long as the trend continues and I should double up position as and when I am presented.  
  
BTW your usdcad, did I see clearly? your that bear bar you considered as EB? are you suppose to engulf the previous bull bar? In my chart it does not tell me it engulf.  
  
Vince, just to confirm. For filter, you use confirmation bar. You use retracement, Trend line you mentioned too? What other filter you use sorry to make you repeat.  
  
Finally, to wait for retracement and place a limit order says a lot of us who does this. We must be very confident of this strategy as retracement and placing a limit order means the price has to go up to meet your fibo 100 when in fact your intention is to sell. You will be seeing a bull bar and to still believe it will come down to place a limit order.

Hello Guys,  
  
So just my two cents on this ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
I have backtested visually a few charts and it seems that this strategy is really good. I have made the following modifications to the strategy however.  
  
I have added a 40 EMA. I only trade a BUY if the 30 EMA is above the 40 EMA. Vice Versa for the Sell. I also am a bit more aggresive in terms of my entry.   
  
I have added the following levels to my FIB.  
  
So for a buy trade:  
  
1) Check for engulfing bullish engulfing candles above 30 EMA.  
2) Ensure 30 EMA is above 40 EMA or about to cross 40 EMA (This can also be done on the confirmation candle)  
3) Check confirmation candle to ensure that it breaks the high of the bullish engulfing candle  
4) Open close of correct confirmation candle enter a BUY Trade Immediately.  
5) Place 1 x Buy Limit and 1 x Buy Stop - Buy Limit is @ 0.5 retracement of Engulfing Candle & Buy Stop is @ 1.25 of Engulfing Candle.  
6) SL for all is at 13 pips below 0 retracement.  
7) TP for Original Order is 2.5 Retracement, TP for Buy Limit is 2.0 Retracement and TP for Buy Stop is 3.0 Retracement.  
  
What do you guys think? Currently in a few trades and in profit.

Icebot53, this thread is now almost international as we have AFrican country as well. Thanks but I am lost on item 5 onwards. But you need not explain.  
I am very interested in the ema40 which means the price must be above both ema 30 and 40 and enter after confirmed bar. I guess item 5 onwards is really optional.

How long have you tested the retracement to 100%? Can you show me an example? How many opportunities have you missed when it did not retrace all the way?

Item 5 is just allowing for additional entries. I am quite an aggressive trader so I would open multiple positions on 1 engulfing candle depending on the retracement.  
  
Another thing I would mention is the condition of the confirmation candle. Look at the attached chart. I am currently trading on demo as I have an account manager trading my live account until I can prove myself worthy.  
  
You will see a bullish engulfing candle but the confirmation candle is bearish. However, the low of the bearish candle did not reach even the open of the Bullish candle and such long wicks/shadows to the upside on the bearish candle. This gives me an indication that even though the bears won that 4H fight, there is still a lot more momentum to the upside than to the downside. For this reason, I entered this trade.  
  
I also attach a screenshot explaining what I mean with the momentum. The bulls actually won more than the bears in the confirmation candle, even though it finished bearish. This however, complicates the strategy, and I do not want to intrude and place my own perceptions on this, but I will defintely use it in my arsenal.

The reason why I added the EMA 40 is this:  
  
I visually backtested on the USDCAD chart H4. it almost formed an engulfing candle with a lot of momentum to the downside. However, GREEN EMA (30) is still above BLUE EMA (40) and hence I would not sell on that candle. I know it did not form a proper bearish engulfing, but some traders might take that. Try the EMA (40) if you want and see. It helped me in quite a bit of backtesting. Now to look to the future and see what happens.

Thank you all for your input. Unfortunately we have not heard from the author herself for some time. What we lack here is someone to take up the leadership so that it does not deviate into a monster.  
  
I guess we can keep it as simple as it is when it got started. So guys, confirmation bar or not it is up to you. Only an handful of you think confirmation bar is important but it mess up the R:R ratio. As to Icebot idea, it sounds complicating for new comers on what is buy limit and what is buy stop. You must agree this jargons are not easy for new comers. But we thank him for his input. His idea that ema 40 must be above ema30 to take a valid bearish EB is really interesting and I think it makes a lot of sense. Its another filter perhaps.  
  
But I am happy that this thread has for now being very polite in all your replies. Please keep it that way as I do not want anyone to go into a depression when cyber bullied.  
  
Thank you all.We would like to hear more from Trinquete, Vince and nelson 123 and those who so far has been profitable. Their method is working albeit some filter which may prevent us from understanding. So whoever wants to contribute you are welcome just that you must understand that you need to keep it real simple.  
thank you once again

This are my current trade notice the NZDusd and USDYEN are repeated as I was presented twice EB along the same trend. So my purpose is to make the best of it. I guess its proving ok for me right now. Waiting for TP

Hello Mates  
  
Till date, my account was up 11% from beginning of month. Thanks to hz10 for this wonderful stratergy. This is not the quick rich stratergy but slowly, you can get what you want from forex market.  
  
Been trying to find out most simple way to trade the market, unfortunately, too many people trying to complicated the market, till i found this thread and now i think i found the way suitable to me, which is no brainder stratergy.   
  
Finger Crossed.

NZDUSD TP hit!  
  
But for USDCAD, switched my bias to long.  
  
Shorted EUR pairs as well.  
  
I also support Trinquete's analysis on HH,HL,LH and LL.

Today’s results. Was able to close in positive. Glad I switched bias on USD.. Some trades manually closed..   
  
To answer the previous question.  
I mentioned before that I also use this strategy not just for trend trading(buying above 30ema and selling below 30ema) But also for Counter trend trading(buying below 30ema and selling above 30ema)..  
Also take note, that I don not just trade any engulfing candles I see blindly. There are also other factors I consider especially for counter trend trades which I also mentioned before. Maybe we can also ask Trinquette why he trades this strategy for counter trend? Coz my simple answer for this is Price Action and always check structure on the left especially for previous s/r also...   
  
May we all succeed in this... Also just keep trading simple. Just trade first using the basic rules by our thread starter which is trend trading which really works..  
  
After a few months or years and with enough screen time, I am sure you will master price action then you can do counter trend trades too... Coz that’s what what this thread is all about “simple 4h trading”

Yes mate, I am considering the 30ema.  
  
But I dont trade all engulfing candles That shows up, if I do a counter trend trade, I consider other factors as well and I mentioned that here already a few times.. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

This kind of explanation was needed, if not it may confuse any new guy who just read this thread because its not the same rules as the op stated on the first page..  
  
If i may suggest, for the future if any post that is not the same with the basic rules then explanation is needed. Because not all of us is an expert of price action or any other trading metode.

According to the original rules no, but as we said before. It might be a good idea to wait for confirmation candle to break the low of your bearish engulfing candle to show that the momentum is indeed bearish. 

I am still a NOOB!!! Damn, there goes another 10 pips!

Thanks for the updated version.  
Just a question, do I need to attach the template to all currency pairs i want or does the currency pair listing on the chart mean they is checking the conditions in the background for the listed pairs? I mean in your screenshot the pairs are marked with a color. This i function is not on my Broker (JFD) /Metatrader. All pairs are in the same color (also if the condition is true)  
  
If I attach it to a currency pair the detection and also the notifications over push notification is working.

Hello Mate  
  
Nice trade.   
But the strong bullish bar shaked off alot of confidence. I never take this EB but will follow up and see.

Yeah, only problem is when the trade was opened, the strong bullish bar wasn't there.

Caught a nice trade on EURJPY this morning. Currently deep in profit.  
  
The bullish candle is highlighted in orange. It was not a complete bullish engulfing but I was satisfied.  
  
Also, price was trading below both EMA 30 AND 40 but creating higher lows, which is telling me trend is about to change.  
  
This will probably lead to price soon trading above the EMA lines.  
  
Edit: I moved my stop loss to 1.5 retracement one price was close to 2.0 retracement and got stopped out with +24 pips  
  
Edit 2: I shouldn't let fear enter my trades. Price has gone back bullish and on its way to TP even though I got stopped out.

Hey Icebot. You should probably start your own thread. What you are posting here has nothing to do with the method and you haven't got a strategy. Eur/Jpy is in consolidation and you couldn't trade your way out of a paper bag.  
  
Take it somewhere else. Bye. Good trading to you.

Here's a daily chart of Eur/Jpy. As you can see, it's still trading within the bounds of the day of 12th November. Probably not the best pair to choose right now for this strategy, until it makes a break out.

Hi guys  
  
Please refrain from any discussion outside what is the rule from hzs10. We should not let her feel that we had hijacked her idea and her thread by introducing something completely different. I don't know when she will be back and we should not shocked her if she could not recognise this was the thread she started. No matter how profitable your trade may be, if it is irrelevant to this thread please control your emotion and don't shout out as it completely confuses and it does nothing to educate and motivate the rest of us.  
  
I am not the author but I too get annoyed with contribution that far exceeds the fundamental idea of this thread, which is simple, easy to understand and to be contributed peacefully and cordially with one another.   
  
So, please understand....thank you

Thank you profitnik for the expert, can you please improve conditions of the engulf candle to the ideal one only as follows:  
for buy:  
1\. 2nd candle open is same or lower the close of previous candle  
2\. 2nd candle low is same or lower than low of previous candle   
3\. 2nd candle close is higher than open of previous candle  
4\. 2nd candle high is higher than high or previous candle  
  
For sell: opposite of but conditions   
  
also if possible to adjust settings of the MA in the expert and will be great addition if you can add support and resistance indicator to it

Hi ZackWj  
  
not sure you mean which pin bar. But if it is the same one I attached my chart, with a tick then I don't see that as any engulfing.  
The bar that is forming now which will close at 10pm seems more like engulfing.  
  
thanks

Sorry I re read your question again, I think I mistaken. You did not ask for engulfing bar but confirmation. But where is the engulfing bar in the first place?

Zack see the document. The last bar in green is the confirmation bar which is after the engulfing bar. This is taken from website.

Hello Mate  
  
I was going to take it like yours, but i used up free margin for my account. I believe its just a retracement. Finger crossed.

I see a strong looking Eur/Usd bullish engulfing on one of my feeds. I won't be taking it because around 1.1460 is the 2016 high, an important level, which was rejected yesterday. Dunno if I'm missing out here:

Morn folks  
  
this week has been a hard week as I got a series of losses using this method. USDYEN, NZDUSD in particular. But I am not about to give up yet or switch to another strategy.  
  
Yesterday GBPNZD TP in my sleep which gives motivation to carry on. I guess I am just lucky as GBPNZD was trading in a range. So Comrades, lets move on and we welcome more recommendation for setups and discussion on any opinions about certain setups. Currently just have GBPUSD short in my trade.  
  
please keep your own strategy to yourselves if it does not follow the rules of setups of this thread.

That isn't an engulfing if your following the original rules and bollinger bands aren't apart of the strategy and that ema doesn't look like a 30ema, maybe these things could have contributed to some of your losses ?

Hi fxirich  
  
you are sharp. Yes I draw wrong ma and Bollinger should not be there. But I was lucky because I saw the bearish bar that engulf just the body of the pin bar to the left. My engulfing definition does not follow exactly like hzs10 including wicks, I take engulfing it engulf the body without the wicks. But basically in my mind, I follow the rules. It was a winning trade for this one. I think the rest of my losses has no Bollinger and the ma was correct ema 30. Thanks

i believe almost everyone here, going through that phase.. including me.  
if u see a new trading system/strategy u better test it on demo account before going live.  
if u constantly on profit, then u can go live with confident..  
  
new long position on EURAUD.. this one looks like a retrace on D1

Hi  
first I am not sure why you translate it into Vietnamese when quoting reteid2222. I believe he is not Vietnamese.  
  
This is my opinion. To survive in this harsh forex world, follow a strategy you can understand and do not hop around after losing a few trades in succession.   
If you have seen some threads in forex factory, there was one started in 2016 and until today, two year later, people are still contributing and following the trading rules and garner some 10 thousand post as of this morning. It is those who preserve that will finally see lights at the end of the tunnel. You need to be in this for the long haul. If forex trading is easy, then, everybody does not need to work.  
  
As for hzs10 method, I sincerely believe that this strategy is simple to understand and I could say profitable in the long run. Money management and a bit of common sense will help you through. If you want people's help, it is in this thread, Personal mentor, I don't think so. There is no easy short cut.

Vince, good one. Just my thought. Why you have not taken the first USDCHF engulfing bar below ema 30 further up before your entry . In fact there are two more eb on top. If you have, it already tp. And if you have taken all you would have double profit.  
  
Also, EUUSD your buy, you did not wait for confirmation bar?

Yea, you are right. I posted in error.In fact I entered in error as there were no EB. When I enter this trade, I did not see it was not EB , my mistake. Sorry about that.

When I took the EU trade, there was another bar up already but it closed as bearish(next to the engulfing)  
  
I did not take the earlier Engulfing candle because I was busy during that time and was way too late if I will base my trade on the previous candles...

Overall positions for today. Can sit infront of the computer and focus.   
  
Also remember today is US and JPY holiday so there will be lesser liquidity in the market.

Hello,

its pretty hard right now to predict GBP pair with every breaking news about Brexit, except it you were a long term trader.  
but ill keep trading GBP using this strategy..  
  
@frosty85  
if u intended to test this strategy, u better use a fixed lot size. if not, its hard to tell if u in profit or not...  
  
btw CADJPY hit SL  
current trade USDJPY n AUDJPY, 8 wins 6 loses.. still in profit +97.8 pips  
  
most of the pair was ranging this week ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1)

vince bro, as i am not a Metatrader user, i couldnt really understand your screenshot.  
If you do not mind, could you write out your system or any deviation from the Original trading method?

Closed UJ and AJ manually for a profit to focus more later on CAD news...  
  
While switched bias on Gold from Long to Short since there's a nice 4H engulfing candle that has been printed for more possible downside confirmation...

The only reason why GBP pairs is not good to trade right now because of the different news coming out which makes the pairs so difficult to trade having very high volatility..  
  
You have to be in front of your computer and monitor your trades and don't blink if you want to stay profitable.  
Or in short, you have to be nimble if you really want to.  
  
I'm not saying that GBP is really not tradeable using this system, but I noticed that basing on the past performance of other traders also here(including your results), there's a low win rate on GBP. So, if that's the case, why even bother, right? But that's just me...

Hi Zack,  
  
My screenshot is nothing special. The object I drawn on the chart is just Fibonacci Tool and the 30 EMA. Nothing fancy. You can replicate the same using any other platform even in tradingview...  
  
I use the same trading system that has been shared by our thread owner. The only difference I do is I add a counter trend trades, which means sometimes I buy even when the price is below the EMA, just as long there's a strong confirmation that price is about to reverse/retrace... Same with shorting, I sometimes sell even when the price is above the 30EMA.

SL Hit on FJ due to EUR news as well...  
  
I'm also eyeing all EURO pairs.. Good candidate for shorts... Engulfing bars already formed...  
  
Let's wait for the 4H candle close 1 hour from now...

Hi Flaffie,  
  
I stick with risking 1% only per trade.  
So, what I do is determine first where my SL would be from my entry.  
Once I know the # of pips between my entry and SL, I use this tool to determine my lot sizes. [https://www.myfxbook.com/forex-calcu.../position-size](https://www.myfxbook.com/forex-calculators/position-size)

Hi Everyone,  
  
I couldn't resist simplicity of this idea, which is very EA friendly. I wrote an EA for who don't want to watch the screens. It took me 20 day cause I m an amateur programmer...  
Anyway thank you for your brilliant idea: Owner of the thread!  
  
Here my 8 month test which has very precise tickdata used from swiss bank sourced data provider.  
It is promising but EA is not fully ready to use on Real Account.  
I hope you don't mind I am sharing it in here, I thought to open new thread but trading method is not mine so it would be disrespect to owner.  
Default settings are fine and it uses Breakout instead of opening orders rightaway. I tested many times and Profit Factor is much better , and it doesn't change the pips earned...  
  
Here is the package.... Hope someone forward test this and we can improve it![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Confirmation bar? Is this something you made up? I don't see the person who started the thread talking confirmation bars. She just opened a trade based on the engulfing bar, wherever the price was at that moment.

Oh, i am very delighted with your post and have been looking for something like this!. Really, i do not have the time to monitor the screens like you said and i know this system is EA friendly. I have seen a similar EA online which worked well too but i cannot get it to trade yet.. I will follow you closely on this as i am very interested. I hope my suggestions to improve the EA is welcome too?

Can you add trailing stop so that we can possibly have an option to let our profits run? Then the breakeven function as well as the trailing stop could have 'breathing space'? See the snapshot below

I checked it works. You shouldn't open the file directly. Copy and paste it into MQL4 experts folder. Then restart your terminal. You will see at the left of the screen under experts section. Then you should allow all live trading so EA can work.   
Hope this helps.

Hi cyberecoder,  
Congratulations! I think you have achieved a big break through.  
Are you using any indicator in addition to the EA?  
Please share the template & indicator too.  
Thanks with best Regards,

Anything above the line is an uptrend, below the line is a downtrend.

Profit factor is how much will TP be compared to whole engulfing candle. 1 means it will get same amount pips engulfing candle size.  
  
BEfactor is Breakeven point EA will modify orders. 0.5 means (0.5 * whole candle )+ low for buy orders. It is as described as in first orders. It means when price go above(buy) or below(sell) 1.5 times candle size it will move SL to Breakeven. I already included candle size in code, so you only need half to add orderopenprice if you want strictly follow first rules. But you are free to change how ever you want but I don't recommend.  
Here are some results from todays work:

It is not bug free yet. And need to add lots of options like mm , trailing stop or so... I will work on it more to make it perfect.

2 Questions for “** _cfudge_** ” whom I know reads this thread and trades this system but using daily candles:  
  
1\. To increase your risk/reward ratio, have you experimented with setting an alarm when price hits 100%fib, then setting a pending limit buy/sell order at 90%fib (i.e. a 10% retrace)? — if yes, the spread can be ignored, and question #2 below becomes irrelevant.  
  
———  
  
(please refer to what I’ve circled/underlined in RED) in the pic below for question #2  
  
2\. When you set pending orders at high/low of engulfing candle, do you account for the **_spread_**?

I've loaded your EA on my VPS on 28 pairs with default settings.  
  
Do I have to change the magic number on each chart or can I leave it? 

Anything above the line is an uptrend, below the line is a downtrend.

No need to change magic number since its checks symbols too. But I don't recommend putting to 28 pairs because most of them are give similar signal at same time. This creates a big risk on account. I think major pairs are enough. I will post an updated version I am working on now.

Alright, good to know. The stop loss may be too tight too, there should be some 'breathing space', else price could still hit our stop loss and still go in our direction. I'm running the EA now on vps

Just a tip bro and also to everyone else here..  
  
Setting a stop loss should not be fixed on the number of pips but one should look for an area where they should place a stop loss where once the price reached on that location, it will invalidate their trades already.  
  
So Timidave is correct. We should put a breathing space for our stop loss..

Like ranilo.vince & Trinquete have pointed out, this strategy works much better if used with price action. I believe a set EA losses over long term on multiple pairs without the use of discretionary price action and optimized entry/stop.  
  
But, I wouldn't write off an EA totally, you might be able to filter some trades out with and additional indicator.

Stoploss is not tight , sometimes it reaches over 100 pips.

Yes, brokers use a variety of timezones. This strategy is working better on GMT +2 offset brokers.  
I found an Indicator to timeshift the H4 chart (create a H4 chart based on H1 with timeshift) <https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=206301>  
Unfortunately the period converter is not so optimal because you need to create an offline chart for every pair you want to observe and you need to keep the source chart (H1) open. But is is a workaround if you don't want to switch the broker.

My definition of 'tight' is based on how close it is to the previous high or low of the candle that determines it. Allowing a space of 5 -10 pips relative to the candles high or low may be fine.

I track all Major and Minor pairs even Exotic pairs but only pairs with tight [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide")... Oh and also Gold...  
But also, my personal preference is I avoid GBP pairs as well, not wrong to trade them but for me I am staying away on this currency.

Oh, good to know. You said it was a backtest and mentioned that; 'did'nt enter enqulfing candles if trade was already active' Sounds like a live trade you did, like a forward test?

fxlrich, good research. Have you tested the winrate for engulfing candles over 100 pips for GBPNZD. I ask because 100 pips is nothing for GBPNZD.  
By the way, did you check for very small candles?

No nothing to do with my live trades, all that means is when i was back testing and came across a trade, i would enter it and then not enter another trade on the same pair until the current trade i was testing either hit TP or SL, even if there was another valid engulfing bar setup, i would not take it if i was already in the process of waiting for a trade to reach one of those levels. hope that made sense.

no i did not test candles over 100 pips, but i know there are some trades with 100+ pip SL that would have hit TP in back testing. i agree 100 pips is quite small for gbpnzd but not within my risk tolerance at this point. and yes i took all engulfing bars even small ones if they closed with strength (above/below the 61.8 fib)

Thank you so much for your research!!  
Did you use the "Shift SL to 1 when hit 1.5" rule?

Sounds like a solid plan. 

Anything above the line is an uptrend, below the line is a downtrend.

But is is a workaround if you don't want to switch the broker.

This explains a lot.  
I am UK-based, so my 4-hour bars are out of synch with yours.  
So, the 4-hours are 2am-6am, 6am-10am, 10am-2pm, 2pm-6pm, etc?  
  
Looking at it at a deeper level, the profitability is an artifact of the trading sessions, maybe?  
Good trading, nonetheless.

Hi All,  
  
i have read this thread with lot of interest because i have been using a decent similar strategy for quite long time:  
  
Daily: EMA 9  
Weekly: EMA 21  
  
Trading Plan during weekends across all pairs:   
  
1\. Checking all pairs weekly TF to see where price is: up or down the EMA?  
2\. Check what is last valid candlestick pattern on Weekly, doesn't matter if i have a short enfulfing above the EMA i just take note.  
3\. Go down to Daily and take a trade each time price create a candlestick pattern on EMA 9 based on my weekly trading plan.  
  
This was a decente one, issue was trade management, several times i couldn't hit nor RR 1:1.  
  
  
This strategy here looks similar, easier but also doesn't solve the problem of RR at least 1:1 but the management here is quite decent by shifting SL at 1.  
  
Another comment: i noticed here many traders trade engulfing which are not real engulfing.  
Please note that an engulfing candle is a candle that ENGULF the whole body of previous candle which doesn't occur very often.  
  
Also i saw traders taking many traders every day: how is possible in H4 TF?  
Real engulfing candles in H4 are not many..there could be even days without trading.  
  
Thank you

Just another observation, when breakeven function triggers, it does'nt cover spreads or commission. SO, perhaps you could adjust the programming so it could, otherwise the breakeven would always leave a small loss behind

Hello Cyberecoder. I am new to this forum and have been doing some trial testing since Thursday.. Please may I request you to kindly share the EA that you have created (updated version please), so that I can also test the strategy using the EA, especially for the trade management. Thanks heaps in advance.

Copy and paste it into MQL4 experts folder. Then restart your terminal. You will see at the left of the screen under experts section. Then you should allow all live trading so EA can work. Hope this helps.

Hi  
I have a question about your back tests. Did you move your SL to BE after 150?

Yes moved SL to fib level 1.0 so the top or bottom of entry candle, once price touched fib level 1.50

Hello fxlrich. It appears that the price retraced at previous resistance on H4 chart and was also close to the upper Bollinger Band.. Another thing that I have observed on some of the losing trades is that the price goes midway between Fib level 161.8 and 200 before it retraces in some of the instances.. Would also like to mention that the NZDCAD trade was perhaps not per rules.. The engulfing candle did not create a higher high. Not sure if I am missing something here. Just learning and pretty new to this forum. Just thought I should share my thoughts. Good luck

Not all of these trades in the list are taken with engulfing candles right?  
  
What other trigger are you using to enter these trades?

yes price was in a pretty tight 4hr range, so i put that trading on just a a test to see if price was ready to yet to break out of the range, which obviously it wasn't but i don't really mind i didn't lose any money.   
I don't think your looking at the right candle for the nzdcad trade. the candle i entered on is the one the fib tool is drawn on, which is a valid bearish outside bar, making a higher high and lower low then the previous candle.

Do you wait for confirmation candles too before entrying a trade or you don't. Secondly, why didn't you just upload your statistics indicator here for as download. I googled 'infoplus' but couldn't find it. Thanks

i dont use confirmation candle, imo if u use confirmation candle its gonna be too late to open position and sometimes its more than 1:1 RR. i immidiately open position after engulfing candle on H4 closed.  
if u see engulfing candle on H4, then u should try to look on H1.. most of the time there is already a reversal on H1.  
  
about the indi, u should look on mt4 market.  
here is the link <https://www.mql5.com/en/market/product/21611>  
  
ur u can search via ur mt4.. im just trying to respect the progammer.

Good observation. A glance at the daily tells us that the H4 trade is not a certainty. Maybe when it breaks 129 or 127? 

Gone to a better place

I'm located in Denmark (same timezone) and this is very profitable for me. 28% this month. Take trades at 7.00, 11.00 and 15.00 with [IC Markets](/brokers/ic-markets "View IC Markets Broker Profile"). Fit perfect into my day. Do not need to take any trades later or earlier.

I'm living in the same timezone and am using ICmarkets also.  
  
I checked the trades that you posted on nov. 12, do you trade only the candles that have the body over the previous candle? Or what are your strategy terms? 

Anything above the line is an uptrend, below the line is a downtrend.

Yes only engulfing bars who closed below or above previous candle and according to trend. Preferred not touching EMA at all.

Here we go.  
  
Replaces v2.  
  
If you want to use the indicator more than once in the same chart, Unique_ID parameter for each must be different. Example of possible use twice as per image is to have different lookback periods.

Ha-ha!  
Therein lies an aspect of this system.  
Are the plethora of pips a function of a specifically great system, or just multiple trades in a tranche of correlated currencies?  
  
If you look at the screenshots of all the trades, that some here kindly upload, you can see the trades make 100+ dollars, but are off just 10-15 pips.  
Thats borderline scalping. Off a 4-hour chart.  
  
Anyway, really interesting ideas here. I notice the thread originator, hzs10, hasnt logged onto FF since Nov 12th.

ONLY if you interpret the market (and humans are bad at that) it works a bit better. But still, this strategy is doomed to fail (backtested it on data since 1987, 28 pairs already (H4 and D1)).

Thanks for the feedback from your backtest. If you have read every of my updates, i did not guarantee anything on the method and i am still on to the forward testing. Anyone who use their real account to trade using this method do it at their own risk. If you have nothing positive to provide or help to benefit others, i dont need you to tell us what is doom to fail using backtest results. As i know some methods which provide good win rate on backtest might not do well on forward test too. This is relatively subjective. On my last update on early Nov i did mention this is not confirm a "Perfect" strategy but i do hope at the very end it will be a profitable one. I hope this is the last time i explain myself. Any such post will be removed and the person will be blocked.

I do not want to make things complicated for now. So experienced traders know what to trade and when to enter trade. For beginners just follow as per rules on demo account.

Because i got tired drawing lines of Fibonacci, i coded an expert advisor (MT5) which is a trade panel that opens orders with [hzs10](https://www.forexfactory.com/hzs10) trade logic.  
When u get an alert from your engulfing indicator or visually, you can use this EA as a trade panel.  
When u click Buy/Sell, it will open an order and draw automatically the Fibo Levels in the chart.  
  
When the prices reaches :  
\- Level 1.5, it will move SL to breakeven level (1.0)  
\- Level 2.0, it will move SL to level 1.5  
\- I added level 2.5 and when the price is near X points of this level, SL will move to level 2.0 .  
\- When level 2.5 is reached, it will close the order.  
**If you dont want to use level 2.5, just add the value 2.0 (Level 3) and X points away from this level will move the SL to level 1.5 too.**  
The EA has no limitations.

Nov updates  
  
I have been away from this thread and i did not actually expect it is so active and the amount of posts i have to read. Took me a couple of hours. Afterall this strategy can't guaranteed anything but yet i am glad to see peiple benefiting from it. The reason why i did not come so often because i do not want to feel obligated to post and with so voices to my initial rules, i do can get affected too. If you read my updates, i am perfectionist and voices do come into my mind to want to add more things on top of my initial rules. This will affect the objectivity and the results of my initial strategy.  
  
Here is the results that everyone is expecting. But no so as the overall result is a lost of -47pips. However this was not the result of my original strategy as like what i have said i changes abit to the original. So instead of TP at 200, i use 161.8. So no shift of BE to 100.   
  
My thought process for this month is that shifting BE to 100 is necessary as it protect your trade from going against you. A break even trade is always better than a lost trade.   
  
Why 161.8? Because the number is what most traders used when using fibonnacci. Also voices said that most of the time PA does not hit 200 level and went against them. So my observation is most of the time it did hit 200 but my trade hit 161.8 and exit which affect overall profitability. As you can see since i shifted to this level, the RR is even getting narrowed with bigger risk. And with no shifting BE to 100, i am not surprised this month is a loss. However i am glad is a small loss. Afterall, i have a 38% increased in 3 months(including nov) using this mobile trading method.

For December, i will go back to my rules, however like many said, i will take note of the body of the engulfed bar as too large will affect your RR. Looking at higher timeframe will definitely helps as i reckon this is the basic for experienced traders. High and low of the chart will definitely help give you the overall trend and a change of trend.  
  
Using support and resistance is still debatable to me as market can always break that region and you dont know when but conservative traders please continue if you benefit more this way.  
  
Having a confirmation using the third bar? It seems good on backtest but forward test? Do it and share the results over 6months on demo? RR affected, no BE to 100 to protect the trade, this is smilar to my nov results but with less trades? The third bar confirmation will not tell when the market will change. As usual, forward test and share results and dont just based on backtest is more realistic with no guesing whether it works or not

> Nov updates I have been away from this thread and i did not actually expect it is so active and the amount of posts i have to read. Took me a couple of hours. Afterall this strategy can't guaranteed anything but yet i am glad to see peiple benefiting from it. The reason why i did not come so often because i do not want to feel obligated to post and with so voices to my initial rules, i do can get affected too. If you read my updates, i am perfectionist and voices do come into my mind to want to add more things on top of my initial rules. This will affect the objectivity and the results of my initial strategy. Here is the results that everyone is expecting. But no so as the overall result is a lost of -47pips. However this was not the result of my original strategy as like what i have said i changes abit to the original. So instead of TP at 200, i use 161.8. So no shift of BE to 100. My thought process for this month is that shifting BE to 100 is necessary as it protect your trade from going against you. A break even trade is always better than a lost trade. Why 161.8? Because the number is what most traders used when using fibonnacci. Also voices said that most of the time PA does not hit 200 level and went against them. So my observation is most of the time it did hit 200 but my trade hit 161.8 and exit which affect overall profitability. As you can see since i shifted to this level, the RR is even getting narrowed with bigger risk. And with no shifting BE to 100, i am not surprised this month is a loss. However i am glad is a small loss. Afterall, i have a 38% increased in 3 months(including nov) using this mobile trading method. {image} {image} {image} {image} {image} {image} {image} {image} {image} {image}

Just like ahgang said, to me ur basic rules work best.  
For me this system is a set and forget.. i never move to BE, i never tp at 150, and in my trading im still on profit.  
Im just looking for outside bar and sometimes it give me more than 1:1 RR  
  
Imho adding more filter or indicator to this system seems kinda useless.  
If we lose some, better to let it go..  
overall we will still be in profit just using the basic rules of this system.  
  
Simple and stress free, not more than 5 minutes to analyze 

Okay... sorry about my messed up English Tenses

Hello Mate  
  
Well said.   
  
One more thing that help me growth my account to 26% this month because i use fixed %SL instead of use fixed lotsize SL.  
  
IMO, for low volatile pairs, the SL tend to smaller compare to high volatile pair such as GBP. As my SL TP is 1 to 1. It may happen i win 2 trades from AU with 30pips each but lose all in GBP trade as it may need 70 to 90pips for SL per trade. So to prevent this to be happen, i use fixed % for each trade.   
  
As you can see this month my profits pips only 235. But account growth 26%, thanks to that.

How do you calculate the lot size if there many pairs to look at before the next open bar. Let say it happens there are mang trading opportunities for the next bar. Maybe you can explain in details for those who are interested. Do note that it should be applicable to mobile trading. I dont mind to try the fixed % of SL. But with my work sometime i only get less than 5 min to look at the phone. But still feel free to demonstrate how you do the lot size calulation when you do your trading

Hello Mate  
I always use 3% for each trade. Which is fixed 15sgd per trade. My account is 500sgd. Refer to my broker interface below.

Normall i will check how much SL in pips needed for the pair, and just keyin into broker apps and then adjust the units to make it SL and TP match 15sgd. Thats all.   
  
And about many pairs at the same time, i dont encounter this situation as most of the time, i will open 1 to 2 trades at the same candle. Rarely 5 to 6.

Don't know why... But it seems that your candlestick on your broker shows differently??  
  
Check my screenshot again and the 2nd to the last candle is where I based my trade.

I dont think all brokers provide such service in their App. Most people use metatrader to trade. However there are many free lot size calculator you can use.  
  
Simple math  
  
1 lot size, 1 pip is 10usd  
0.1 lot, 1pip is 1usd  
  
Let say acc 3000 usd, 1% is risk 30usd per trade  
  
And if your SL is 38pips  
Lot size = （30/38） * 0.1 =0.0789

Hello Mate  
  
Yes you are right not all broker provide such platform. But i been using it few years back till now.   
  
Yes simple math will do the job but its just rough estimation, the main thing i wish to express is fixed % SL provide more stability to forward test the system efficiency.

Try eliminating GBP pairs even EURGBP even for a month and see if you will get better results.. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Just use support/resistance on Daily time frame. And yes, no need for third bar confirmation because most of the time, the 3rd bar confirmation is where your TP already got hit.

ranilo.vince is right: acoording to the rule by [hzs10](https://www.forexfactory.com/hzs10) must the high/low of the engulfing candle completely engulf the high/low of the candle before it. By her definition only high/low count NOT open/close.

thanks for the explanation..  
  
one last thing, when bullish engulfing candle formed, it can engulf either bearish or bullish candle?  
because on those picture, when bullish engulfing candle formed, it was engulfing bearish candle. and the other way around.

Hi Vince, that is an outside bar not an engulfing bar. I've seen traders trading off of that...nothing wrong with that, but I thought that the original strategy was engulfing...

Hi Ranger,   
  
I believe this strategy can both be traded using outside bar and/or engulfing bar. So there's should be a consideration for us to use either of the two.

Just a quick update on some changes this month  
  
Rule to enter a trade is still same as post #1  
  
For EUR and GBP cross pairs i reduce the risk which is 0.05. The rest of the pairs remains 0.1. SL remains at 0.0 which TP is 200.0 +3pips for sell trade ; and TP is 200.0 -3pips for buy trade.   
  
Why 3pips? Because average spread for most pairs is 3pips.   
  
Since the lot size i will be using for this month will be different i will go by amount earn for % of profit as i am busy working i do not have the discipline to keep a journal like i used to. So what matter the most is staying positive both the account and mind.   
  
  
Stay green pips

Thank you for the update. So we are back to full candle rather than body only. Will try to focus on the H4 trade and see the outcome.

I see more indicators and EA are showing on this thread. I dont mind you guys using any or share to everyone but please do so privately or create your own thread. I dont want to see anymore version of updated indicators or EA. Please read post #2 over again if you still confused. Please show some respect.  
  
You can post questions, charts and your results but no more files from here onwards. Thanks. I know some have started new thread for EA and please post there instead

Nice results, but what trash broker are you using that has an average 3 pips spread? 

Anything above the line is an uptrend, below the line is a downtrend.

Hello hzs10. While I have had good success during the last 2 weeks of testing, I am a bit confused regarding the posts relating to moving SL to BE. I do not see any mention of this in your post # 2. Please could you confirm that your strategy uses moving SL to BE at FIB 150?  
Thanks in advance for clarifying.

Hello hzs10. I have a question regarding the EURNZD listed in your stats. Your trade appears to have closed out at 1.6369.. This level comes out to be the Fib 150 level on my chart ( attached herewith for your review). Am I missing something or is my broker's candle different to yours please? Just curious, as my 4 Hr Charts did not give me any set-ups for GBPAUD, GBPJPY and GBPCAD. I did get the GBPNZD though, which I missed as the market moved a bit quickly before I could get into the entry. You can please ignore my Preferred Entry level marked on my chart ( which is a deviation from your strategy that I am testing). I use [Pepperstone](/brokers/pepperstone "View Pepperstone Broker Profile") in Australia.. GMT +3 during Daylight saving in the US and GMT +2 at other times. Your input will help me analyse my own results and also allow me to compare my results with your outcomes. I am more concerned if I am missing something or not doing something right? Thanks heaps in advance.

One to keep an eye on, just now, is Gbp/Usd, H4 off support, with supporting fundamentals. Of course it could go badly wrong.

Your broker is fine. You'll see from prior posts that not everyone has an engulfing candle at the same time.

I am following rules of this thread but the difference is I also added an approach for counter trend trades...  
  
So there will be more possible plays...

Hi everyone. Just thinking out loud, What if we put in volume as a confirmation for engulfing candle? If the volume is weak, probably it could be a false breakout?

Just price action and of course engulfing candle on 4h chart only as per rule on this thread.  
And sometimes outside bar since it's almost the same with engulfing bar.

Hi ranilo.vince, what price action book or teachings did you learn off. I know many types of price action, but I'd like to learn what you know ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f600.png?v=15.1)

Hi Zack,  
  
We cannot use volume as indicator or basis of our trade because the volume that you will see is just the volume of trades on your broker alone.  
  
It is not centrallized on all forex market unlike on stock trading. 

We're not here to be right, we're here to Profit Consistently!

I was looking at some of your counter trades. You have marked fib level (0 to 100) for outside (or engulfing) bars, but you have placed the order before the 0 level. It looks to me that you have taken the trades before the formation of outside bars. I see the trades are in positive. Just curious to know your rationale for those counter trades. Thanks.

It looks to me that you have taken the trades before the formation of outside bars. I see the trades are in positive. Just curious to know your rationale for those counter trades. Thanks.

That is what I have noticed also but I didn't wan't to poke it. I don't mind that he is trading the way he does, he must have some good insight in his PA tehnique, but all of his entry's are not based by the "thread rules". But good job anyway, he has truly mastered this strategy.

Hi bro. I have read thru some research, tho it might not be 100% accurate due to decentralised, using big broker like fxcn stil have pretty accurate.  
You can confirm by comparing it with futures market which traded on exchange

Hi Zack,  
  
I marked the engulfing/outside bar (whichever you might want to call it)  
For me either of the two works.. It's on my post on where I drew the Fib tool.

Do you normally hold the trade for either profit or stop loss?

Yes. Just as long the trade is still valid. Also it won't help if you keep looking at your trade especially if you are in DD. Just trust the system and stick to your plan.   
  
But it all depends on you still at the end of the day, what matters most is if we make money or not.

I like it. This is a strong up trend on the daily and it recently broke the year high. That formed a strong resistance, but in my opinion, it will be tested again. Why? Because the uptrend is visible on the weekly and monthly also.  
  
It looks like we are currently using the July high of 1.3288 as support. Quite convincingly, because we can see that it was resistance in November.  
  
But, what do I know? 

Gone to a better place

I was in profits for these short positions but did not protect it.  
  
Took a loss on my shorts but switched bias and ended up in small profits by the end of the day still.  
  
This post is not exactly related to the system. But I just need to post this for proper trade management. Because we can all use and follow a great system but without proper risk management,success is hard.  
  
This is an example for everyone that we don't have to make the perfect trades and stay right all the time BUT we follow the market and stay profitable at the end of the day.

Here you go guys....  
I think this is what most are looking for.  
Trend following trade.  
  
Note: my other trade has a lower SL but it's okay coz I adjusted my lot size to still take 1% risk if I am wrong.

WOW! Monday was bonkers!  
  
Made 413,6 pips, which resulted in a growth 30,6% of my account.   
Started this strategy the 6th of November and i have a total growth of 78,18%.

Still tweaking the position size and risk. My biggest drawdown was 10% of account, which is obviously too much.

GBPNZD played out nice again. Even though the EMA is below price, I went off of Price Action as well.

You are not trading according to this thread. Beside that was an inside bar and not engulfing. Pls respect the thread started

It appeared to be engulfing to me. I just started demoing this yesterday. If you look at my three previous posts you would see that. Thanks for the correction.  
  
I have ave a picture of what she considers an engulfing candle. Are my other examples ok?

I've just looked at the past bars on Daily chart and it seems there is way more consistency but ofcourse less trades also, but who cares if it works on both timeframes.

Hello traders, i've been using this TS for a while and it looks very promising so far.  
  
I have one question for those who succesfully uses this TS in their trading or just understands how it works ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
On picture we see example of bearish engulf bar under EMA, it might not be the best one, but that is not the case, the tail of bearish candle is somewhere 1/3 of whole candle, i wonder if we must enter this setup with sell stop on 100 fibo or we need to enter on the next candle opening, doesnt matter how long is that tail. In first situation we will have 1:1 RR on the other 1.3:1 RR. In this concrete example with sellstop we would have missed the enter or with just selling it would have been stopp loss.  
  
So what we do when we have long tail, buysellstop or enter with better RR?

Here is a valid signal, I still have the same question, what would be the most correct in that particular case. Or we open with sell stop on 100fibo or we sell on new candle opening? (In both cases there would be a profit, but let's abstract from that)

I did too a couple of days ago and i decided i would stay with the daily charts. I backtested all the 28 pairs in the month of November and still came up with about 30 trades that made up to about 5000 pips. But mind you, i rode the trend and used a different exit strategy. In a whole month, there could be just 2 or 3 trades on the daily, but when you look at all the pairs together, you get more trades.

Hi mirkato  
The choice is yours...I open at the high/low but hzs10 opens at close.

Hello too Mirkato...  
  
Actually, you can open anywhere between 0 and 100% fib just not higher than 100%.. If it's slightly lower than 100% then you get better r:r ratio.

Hey mate,  
  
What do you mean by that and where are your targets? I am assuming that you are riding the market as long as possible but where do you take profits? Any examples?  
  
Thanks

I don't know why you are using sell stop. You open the trade at the opening of the next candle after the engulfing candle and the PA must be below 30ema for short and not above. Follow the trend

You will learn more by doing your own research.  
It will help you to develop your ability to spot the engulfing bars, understand them in terms of the broader market structure, and help to deal with the nature of risk/rewards and the nature of having to deal with losses amongst the wins.  
It will help you to become confident in the trading, and become independent minded.  
  
Otherwise, you will just end up constantly asking others opinions, and being driven them.

I looked at the daily too but just on the majors, they offer more results/pips, but require more patience. so a reduction in lot sizes for me is true on the daily cause then you can hold the position a little longer and still go on about intra day trading.

Maybe because we're getting close to the Yuletide, the market is getting quiet too anyway. Also, people have improved upon the basic system in this thread and found more accurate ways to trade and if there ideas are posted here, they would be breaking some of the rules of this thread, hence they keep away. Also, because the owner of the thread herself is quiet. Attached are my results for last week thursday/friday from the 1 hour chart and with slight modiifcation to the basic rules.

Yes. The beauty of this method is, even if you follow the rules blindly, with proper money management you will not be looking at a margin close out anytime soon. This should give the opportunity to anyone with any curiosity to pick and choose the best set ups.  
December is not usually a great month to trade and many professional traders close out.

Current tally is -SGD 4 loss. Almost even win loss odds. Maybe because a lot of consolidation happening this last week with flat EMAs. May get better when tending. Too early to tell overall performance of the system.  
  
I basically adopted the basic rules at the start of the thread. But avoid SL past 50 pips. One thing I need clarification on is when the engulfing bar starts from bottom of EMA then closes above. Is that a valid buy according to the original rules? Some people here avoid it. Some do not. And what about the flat / angled EMA? Is that also a valid modification endorsers by the thread starter? I think by incorporaing the modifications above, one will avoid going in sideways market. But even if we don’t take this in, I think the profit and loss will just offset each other.

I want to be very careful not to try to modify any of the original existing rules because of the danger of over complication or misinterpretation, but as I said in a previous post, there is nothing wrong with curiosity. A good trader learns from their mistakes and not all engulfing candles are the same. Good trading to you.

> Hello all, Trading with candle patterns on the H4 chart is HIGHLY broker-dependent. If you think about it, the HOURLY chart is identical for everyone around the world as the hour changes at exactly the same time everywhere. Likewise the WEEKLY is identical. The problem comes with the H4 and the DAILY. Depending on your broker's "GMT Offset" you will see radically different shapes of candles, because the DAY and H4 bar changes at different times for different brokers. Personally, I only use a broker with a GMT+2 offset. Because the FX markets are...

Philosophical post about Broker offset...  
  
My take on this is people trade in different time frames and intervals. They use different strategies and indicators. Time is continuous. We just cut it up to parts to easily digest the information. People can still make money with Brokers on a different offset and capture the same move. Just different entry and exit points. That’s the beauty of the market, people coming in at different times and perspectives. This is what makes the price move.

ok got the difference between the two though I worked only on outside bar according to your definition but my personal experience agree to your point that is if the second candle fulfills both conditions it usually is stronger signal and tp of even 200 fib also hit

Yes. I choose formations with Open and Close engulfing the previous Open and Close. And also High and Low engulfing the previous High and Low.

Hello Jomni  
  
Do you mean you only take trade when both conditions are met in the same formation, or you take either?   
Also, are you selective with the price action that preceded the engulfing bar, for example, engulfing bar is bullish but previous bar is also bullish, or you only take engulfing structures where prior bar is opposite price action?  
  
Thank you

I love this method on the daily charts, more than 300 pips in 2 days, if you add my unclosed trade. I will keep you guys posted with my result on the daily. I have already backtested it and discovered its'the simplest and most profitable.

Excellent Work Tim!!! Glad you came up with great results as well..  
  
One of my analysis too using all rules on this thread but on the Daily Chart... [https://www.tradingview.com/chart/AU...ort-on-AUDUSD/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/AUDUSD/cW3ZsFtg-Short-on-AUDUSD/)  
  
This is also my plan include Daily timeframe together with 4H..  
  
So, everyday, after an hour or two of NY close, I start analysis of Daily candle and look for possible plays. Then proceed on separate trade analysis for 4H timeframes as well but all trades still having 1% risk only.

Hello to everyone  
  
Thanks Hzs10 for sharing your system and all traders posting their results.  
  
I've manually back-tested all 28 pairs on the 4hr chart for the period April - August 2018.  
I attach the results.

  1. I traded exactly as per Hzs10's rules, taking _every_ signal, like a robot. If it didn't hit fib 200, i counted it as a loss.
  2. A surprising number of long-tailed and oversized candles were winners, even if it took days.
  3. The most significant observation from this backtest: if EMA is flat and previous 7 or so candles crossed it or touched it, it's not a good idea to take the trade, even if the candles closes above or below EMA. That said, there were winners during flat EMA periods, and losers during trending periods. Most often, losers during trending periods were due to SL too close, and then price continued in trend direction.

Out of 978 trades over the 28 pairs, 600 were winners.  
  
I am now continuing the test on the highest-yielding and lowest-yielding pairs to see if this is a trend, or if the results are really just random. Three pairs yielded a breakeven result (winners equal to losers). NZDCHF had a staggering 30 wins and just 5 losses. Not one pair yielded a negative result.  
  
Thank you and happy trading.

Hi Helbor  
nice job, I have done this for most daily pairs and had similar results, whereas NZD pairs are really strong % winners.  
  
Good luck with your testing, everyone should have done this.

Hello cfudge  
  
Yes it was your backtest that inspired me to test the 4hr ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
There are two differences however in how we tested:  
  
1\. i open the trade at the open of next candle, you open at high/low of signal candle  
2\. TP is 200 for me, else i worry the R:R is skewed  
  
I am interested to know, is this how you trade this method on the Daily chart? Enter at high/low of signal candle and TP at fib 150?

I take this, according the rule, but usually I just use the fibo 0,382 and 0,5 to open order to minimize the stop loss. I use the engulf candle as resistance and support. The target is always 1,618 and then 2,618 but we must be saw the engulf candle before, is it already take the 2,618 fibo point.

My idea here is to determine stop loss then calculate lot size by 1% risk only. Then I split the orders into two. 1st order target is 150 fib then second order is 200 fib. Once 150 fib gets hit, move SL to BE of the remaining order and let it hit 200 fib.

Hello Vince  
  
SL = high/low of signal candle (so mostly it's a pending order)  
TP1 = fib 150  
TP2 = fib 200 and beyond  
Each order = 0.5% risk  
  
Correct yes/no?

Merry Christmas traders. I am glad to see this method seems to work for most people. For beginners please dont judge results by just a few trades. Forex is not quick money. I am not against with any one modifying the original strategy that works for them. But please test it with results to show that it works. This is not a trial and error thread.   
  
Great job for vince with counter trend. I use to be CT trader too. Would be interested in the near future again maybe. Result of dec so far looks good.   
  
Stay grern pips

Correct!!! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
I know the original strategy is we move to Breakeven but I prefer to have a little profit already once price reaches 150 fib than Breakeven so that we gain something already...

> Merry Christmas traders. I am glad to see this method seems to work for most people. For beginners please dont judge results by just a few trades. Forex is not quick money. I am not against with any one modifying the original strategy that works for them. But please test it with results to show that it works. This is not a trial and error thread. Great job for vince with counter trend. I use to be CT trader too. Would be interested in the near future again maybe. Result of dec so far looks good. Stay grern pips {image}

My suggestion for you bro is just like what I stated on the thread if you like to have two orders at 1% risk only. 0.5% risk each with two target (150fib and 200 fib so you can maximize possible profits)

Hi. Do we do this instantly? Or wait for H4 candle to close at 150 or above before adjusting.

Yes, do it right away when price touch that level, there is no guarantee price will continue even candle closed above/below, i think it is better to lock for some profit and safety capital purpose.

Wait for candle close. You can dont move also. It is up to you. Like some traders said, sometimes PA can hit your SL before it move towards TP levels. So it still based on live chart analysis. Do note that we arr not doing scalping on lower TF. So be patient and follow your own rules.

Possible Trade for today's 4H system... Possible to short EA but I already entered for some other possible reasons....  
  
But for this trade to fit in this thread's strategy, you may check back 1 hour 35 minutes from now if candle will close/engulf the previous candle to be sure for a possible counter trend play...  
  
Remember, it's still the holidays, so we should expect very low liquidity in the market, so expect very few plays.  
  
P.S. : Your SL and TP might be different from this post because the engulfing candle is still not closed yet as of this writing.

Hi helbor, nice test results !  
Do you move SL to BE once fibo 150 gets hit in your testing?

First trade after the long holiday ends with TP. Anw if any one havent notice, i have changed my updates in my #1 post. I used % for profit/loss instead of pips or $. Because i forgot that the amount earned trading cross pairs does not equivalent to pips. So the pips i showed previously is not accurate. I did not want to show $ because different traders has different account sizes so $ doesn't isnt objective imo. So i think % is much more rationale.  
  
@DeanOliver you have asked a good question. Because most of the time when people follow someone strategy, they just follow blindly. I am once there before but decided to study why those MA. So why 30? In 4H it uses 30bars which equivalent to a week's data. So for short term, i think the 30ema works fine for me as dynamic support/resistance, as well tell me the short term trend. There is no perfect MA. Just use the one that suits you.

Hello Shabu  
  
Nope, in the backtesting process i worked only with TP and SL.  
  
If price didn't make it to TP (fib 200) + spread, i added it to the 'lose' column.   
Only trades where price reached TP + spread were added to the 'win' column.

Do you take CT trades from S/R levels as recommended in the classics? What is your logic?

Why i have that upper wick on my chart? Price didnt show that much up on your chart .. whats your server time? Mine is GMT+2   
IF due to server time difference, candle shape is different ..... then how we compensate this factor in this strategy? Candle might be engulfing on 1 while not engulfing on other... :-)

_December Updates_  
  
Being the last month of the year, market movement seem surprisingly volatile. During the first week of the month i traded GBP and EUR pairs at 0.05lot size while others at 0.1. But i decided to switch back to 0.1 to trade all pairs as i observed other pairs can lose as much as GBP OR EUR pairs. Bc most of the GBP or EUR pairs hit TP this month.  
  
Do note that some months can be bad and some months can be good. Different traders have different trading style and so far sticking to fixed lot size works for me. I wouldn't get 7% profit this month if i didn stick to the lot size.   
  
I am still observing the method and market movement. But i wouldn't do much changes to the rules. So far the results are quite profitable except for last month which i twisted the rules abit. Continue to post chart and ask qns. Most of the ans are in the thread if you have read thoroughly  
  
Stay green pips

thanks for your sharing hzs10.  
I want to ask you, is it true that you determine TP at the point of 150?  
Its mean you let the price touch the TP or SL without you shifting the SL? Right?  
Sorry for my bad english. Thanks.

Hello hzs10.  
I just looked at your entry conditions, easy enough.  
Maybe i may give you a suggestion.  
I like to write EA's (i know, ik know).  
And for a system (not profitable) i payed attention to the winning trades. What was the max DD of the winners?  
So far it turns out that almost all winners had a smaller DD then the programmed SL.  
I your situation, if you find that (almost) all the winning trades only have a DD less to fibo 8 (being 0 SL) , you just as well can set your SL to 7. Means same profit, smaller losses.  
I will follow your brave efforts and let us know when you pay your mum back.

I guess time for you to change your broker to a more legit one coz some brokers tend to manipulate to stop hunt some of their clients...

A question about the entry point:  
When we find an engulfing setup for a buy, do we enter on the CLOSE price (immediately on the start of the next bar, or do we set a stop order on the HIGH of the engulfing?

In the screenshot I have set a stop order, but not sure if that is correct.

The strategy on this thread did not incIude using stop orders but it wiII be more profitabIe using stop orders as it heIps to confirm the enguIfing candIe signaI and aIso fiter out bad trades. A visuaI bactest wiII convince you. I'm stiII expecting your repIy to my PM pIs.

GBPUSD - bad entry as not clearly above the 30EMA and also NFP news affecting it heavily.

On that trade, now your stop loss would have been hit just because you did'nt use a buy stop!

Hi guys, and Happy New Year!  
  
I've been watching this thread and decided to test the method myself. While I only tested it with few transactions, I noticed something important: even if I don't question the rules, I think you should not be stiff with the SL and TP setting.  
  
Look at this GBPUSD transaction from yesterday (and ignore the current transaction, I entered again). It hit TP, but under normal conditions it would have hit SL. That's because the regular SL, on 0 Fibbo, was just above a clear support (3 previous candles reached it). So I moved it just under that support, and look, the last green candle got through the 0 Fibbo but didn't have strength to cross the support too, and it had a huge bounce back to hit TP. I only moved it 12 pips lower, but what an outcome!  
  
I know the wick was not longer than previous candle wick and the direction was not obvious, but it doesn't change much: being a little flexible saves your transaction.  
  
I am sure it's the same with the TP: if the 2 Fibbo is over a clear resistance, taking profit under it should not be an issue for anyone.  
  
So follow the rules, but feel free to slightly break them to refine the transaction, in case some stronger general conditions are met this way.  
  
Good luck to us all!

Hi, is in original rules of this strategy the previous candle colour important? I thought that in bullish engulfing the previous candle shall be bearish and vice versa.  
Thank you.

I took this NZDCAD short position, but as I suggested in a previous post, you should be a little flexible with the SL and TP. You can see there is a previous low that makes a strong support, so I moved the TP upper, to include a possible 8 pips spread too.  
  
I am curious if it holds and the market returns from there or it goes on to close a TP on level 2 Fibbo. We shall see.  
  
Either way, I am sure no one will be unhappy to take a smaller steak rather than see the market return and start loosing.

That's what I have done but I don't know what all the negativity is about, this is just to help others with updating what you've previously posted... but what can I say, you're the funny one, who no one can rely on good luck.

Happy New Year to all  
  
I did a backtest on the month of Dec 2018 using the original Hzs10 strategy but with trading principles inspired by CFudge and RanilloVince.  
Results (in spite of one negative week) were great: 60% gain, risking 4% per trade.  
  
I would like to share:  
  
1\. Risk 4% (for purposes of illustration.)  
2\. Open 2 x positions (2% per position but it can be scaled to your needs)  
3\. Position 1 TP at fib150 (this banks 1% of capital on nearly every trade).  
4\. Now move SL for position 2 to Fib100 plus few pips to have risk-free trade.  
4\. Posiiton 2 takes profit at fib 200 (OR you can ride the trend to maximise profits).  
5\. I traded every signal like a robot, except the 2 candles where i sleep (African time midnight and 4am)  
6\. Yes, it's true, when SL is hit, you lose both positions but losing is part of trading.  
  
I look forward to a profitable 2019, thanks very much again Hzs10 for sharing your strategy and experience ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
It's a winner for us all.  
I continue to backtest on all pairs, even OIl, GOLD and Indices, it proves promising.

The time it took you to write that response you would've already known that I TP'ed on 2 orders and BE on the last following the rules of OP. Next you are going to ask me what the rules are.  
  
It's not about negativity - I'm not obligated to share anything with you, so the fact that you demand that I share with you is ridiculous. Learn to read and interpret information for yourself, maybe it'll do you some good.

Hi Helbor,  
  
please when backtesting, do you take bullish engulfing only if the previous candle is bearish and vice versa or you just watch if the high is higher and low is lower by bullish and vice versa by bearish? I haven't found clear answer here in the thread.   
  
Thank you.

Dear forum users welcome! Another idea occurred to me, to trade also only an internal sconce (example on the screenshot)

Hello Filip 39  
  
When backtesting, i trade like a robot.   
  
I don't care about body colour of previous candle. I trade it when it meets the following criteria (all candles except African Time midnight and 4am).  
  
1\. High and low exceeds previous candle, **not matter the what the body colour of previous candle.**  
2\. When engulfer (or outside bar as some prefer to call it) closes above EMA, I pretend to go long.  
3\. When engulfer closes below EMA, go pretend to go short.  
4\. Positions are split and and managed as previously explained.   
  
When you backtest for yourself, you'll see, many are losers, even when they appear to be perfect setups.   
But more are winners.  
That's all that matters.

So you noticed that? In this case, wouldn't this be a winning technique on the long term, to close at 150 fib instead of 200? The RR is not 1:0.5 as it would be obvious, because you open at the close of the candle, not of the period's low/high, so the remaining wick is part of your profit and less of your risk. The RR would be let's say 0.8:0.7, and if the percentage of wins is more than 75-80%, it's tremendous. You can compensate by increasing the volume a little.  
  
I am not sure I understood the data in your test exactly, but from what you say, wouldn't my opinion be valid?

With all the respect, please don't share each TP or SL, there are many possible transactions and we overwhelm the thread if we all post one trade or another.  
  
Let's better discuss of how we can refine or improve the technique, and also instead of a single transaction, maybe we can post statistics of 10 or more, they help a lot more.  
  
Would that be ok with you?

Hello Syedtaimur  
  
Yes. I move the SL of the 2nd position to BE (Fib100), only once position #1 reaches its TP level of fib150.  
  
Like this:  
  
1\. Open 2 x positions, each risking 2%  
2\. When position #1 reaches Fib150, it closes, and banks 1% of capital.  
3\. Now position #2 is risk-free, and you can ride the trend, or TP at fib200, this banks a further 2%.  
4\. For the backtest i made all my 2nd positions TP at fib200.  
  
Trading like this real-time would be a very different story however.  
If we take every 4hr signal across 28 pairs, it may mean we sometimes have 8 - 12 trades open.  
Risking 4% capital on each trade may result in drawdowns beyond what we're comfortable with.  
I wonder how to further filter the entries as 50-something trades per week is just too many.  
I don't like to have more than 4 x trades open, and i risk only 1% of my capital, 0.5% per position.  
  
I do these backtests to calm my nerves. See attached the results for November 2018, not a great month.  
  
It didn't so much calm my nerves. Week 1 was fantastic but the other three weeks nearly wiped out all the profits from week 1.

Hello mitroiano  
  
Your point is valid, another trader called Cfudge had a similar observation when backtesting on the daily charts. (You will find his data when you read the thread from the beginning.)  
  
The idea with split positions is to use the 2nd, risk-free position and ride the trend as long as possible to maximise profits.  
  
See below screenshot of how i backtest. The example is for week 1 of November 2018 on AUDCAD.  
  
1\. Entry is at open of next candle following the engulfer, this is Fib100. (I draw my fib on the engulfer)  
2\. SL is at fib0 plus spread.  
3\. When position #1 reaches fib150, it closes. It earns one tick (or one %).  
4\. Now i move SL for position #2 to BE (entry point or Fib100)  
5\. Often, price doesn't reach fib200 but we don't lose the whole trade, because we banked that one %. (Like the 2nd trade in my screenshot)  
6\. When price reaches Fib200 without retracing to our entry point, we bank a further two ticks (or 2%, like the 1st trade in my screenshot)  
7\. The idea is (if you're patient) to ride the trend with position #2, moving your SL to the next fib level, i did not. I only tested to fib200.  
8\. In my columns, i capture each tick as one % (for ease of illustration) but we can scale our position sizes according to our needs.  
9\. I don't risk 4% per trade, i only risk 1%, split into two position of 0.5%. So to get a realistic projection of what is possible, i divide the backtest total by 4.  
  
I hope this makes things clearer.

Just some results since starting this method - rules are simple;  
  
Long if engulfing above 30 EMA, short if engulfing below 30 EMA  
  
Move SL to 100 (break even) when price action has moved to 150 fib level.  
  
Hold until TP or SL.  
  
Check candles every 4 hours.  
  
Results might be even better if I risked same amount on each trade but right now I am testing with fixed lot size like OP

Hi Helbor  
  
I have run a simple backtest in Amibroker however my returns are different to you - in the region of 25% winners and 75 losers for E/U with a date range of 11th of May 2018 until 4th of Jan 2019.  
  
In your backtest how do you define your engulfing candle ? I have tried the following (the Ref -1 refers to the previous H/O/L/C:  
  
BullEB = Ref(C,-1) < Ref(O,-1) AND C > O AND O <=Ref(C,-1) AND C > Ref(O,-1);  
BUOVB = L < Ref(L,-1) AND H > Ref(H,-1) AND C > Ref(O,-1) AND O < C AND Ref(O,-1) > Ref(C,-1);  
  
Thanks

Break even is better than a loss!  
  
For me, it depends if I am around a computer to check my trades. If I am, I would've probably also got knocked out at BE, but since I was not, this trade I just let go to TP or SL.

Before the New Year I tried a similar strategy. But she is on a daily timeframe. Decided other options to stop on H4. And yesterday came across this topic. Very interesting. I still get these conditions:  
1\. H4  
2\. no indicators  
3\. buy signal - a closed candle is green (bullish), but an important point, the previous red (bearish) ones should be at least two ... Similarly, for sale  
4\. We work with a pending order. Buy 5 points above the previous high. Stop loss 10 pips below the previous low. Thai Profit Fibo 150.  
5\. If the order did not work before the candle closes, delete it and wait for the next signal.  
So far, raw strategy. He wrote in Russian translated Google, so sorry for the clumsy English)))

Hi Monk  
  
Interesting result ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

  1. My definition is as per Hsz10's strategy: high/low exceeds high/low of previous candle (strictly called an outside bar).
  2. I tested all 28 pairs manually for the period April - end July 2018
  3. The result for EURUSD according to this test: 38 trades, 15 x losers, 23 x winners but keep in mind this is only for the months Apr + May + June + July.
  4. My test results for all 28 pairs are in post #1 851 [https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...7#post11819937](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=11819937#post11819937)
  5. I am in the process of testing the period Aug - Dec, it's laborious.
  6. It is entirely possible to have 7 - 8 losses in a row.
  7. **Taking every signal would not be a good idea, specially not during periods when MA is flat.**
  8. Lately i've tested with a split position approach, TP at 150 for position #1 and letting #2 run to maximise R:R, it's even more laborious ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)
  9. Conclusively, i would follow this approach with discretion, like Hsz10 mentions in her first posts.
  10. Often, a classic body engulfer gives a signal, but because the high/low doesn't exceed the previous bar, and we miss an entire move. We then take a signal too near the top or bottom of a move and it results in a loss.
  11. Most often, losses are due to SL being hit but then price moves in our direction anyway.

Looks like a large number of potential setups in the candle that's about to close in 40 min - keep your eyes peeled!!!!

EURUSD stopped out, can't win them all I guess...EURCAD also currently at an unrealized loss but I will let the system play out and leave it to TP or SL.

if you are referring to this one, then yes  
  
problem is that it's not clearly above or below 30ema so no trade

Question. What is your GMT offset? My broker has no offset and the technique does not seem to work. Or does it?

I was just thinking about the same. Multiple users of this (or any) strategy, using different time zones, will produce different candle formations? And as result, different signals?  
  
Any pro's here in the room who can clarify that?

BTW I just noticed that a trend line can too be helpful to decide moving SL to BE. Instead of BE at 150% you could considering to move to BE at hitting trend line.

It is possible to arbitrarily pick the last 4 hourly candles and draw a 4 hour candle. What are your thoughts on this?

How can you say such a thing? Do you have the charts in front of you and know my entry and exit points? Maybe do some research before you blindly throw skepticism around like the plague? I don't have the time to show you each and every single one but here are some examples;

Well then you have do this every hour I guess. Sounds exhausting. Or probably I do not understand you.

My broker candles don’t have the 2 hour offset. Does that mean it won’t work on me? I’ve tested and it’s not good. But why?

Do you follow the rules? They say move SL to 1.00 fib level if price action reaches 1.50 fib level.

No, here it is not an outsidebar.

> Hello to everyone Thanks Hzs10 for sharing your system and all traders posting their results. I've manually back-tested all 28 pairs on the 4hr chart for the period April - August 2018. I attach the results. I traded exactly as per Hzs10's rules, taking every signal, like a robot. If it didn't hit fib 200, i counted it as a loss. A surprising number of long-tailed and oversized candles were winners, even if it took days. The most significant observation from this backtest: if EMA is flat and previous 7 or so candles crossed it or touched it, it's...

Hi!  
  
Sorry but I don't mean to be a scolding teacher but I believe you got your candlestick wrong.. If you're bullish, previous candle should be bearish..  
  
Please check the ones I marked is where your supposed to be entering.. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Candle colors are nice but I've never been able to find a consistent pattern no matter what I've tried. By "consistent" I mean, 100% of the time consistent, not 99% or less. Have you? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

In trading, please realize that there's no such thing as 100% consistency... There's no system out there that's been created 100% even banks and institutions sometimes go broke.. It all boils down to our money management.. You can succeed as a trader even with just having a 50% winning rate. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

There are many examples of 100% consistent patterns but the problem is, it's not often enough or good enough in terms of risk reward.

What do you mean? There _are_ 100% consistent patterns but they're not good enough, do not occur often enough, nor have a good risk reward. I'm looking for one that is good enough. But it's not true that they do not exist; again, they do exist.

See.. You said it yourself...  
  
"It's not often enough or good enough in terms of risk reward."  
  
So, if you're saying those many examples of 100% consistent patterns exist, then trading should have been for everybody already, but it's NOT.

I'm just following OP's rules, it ain't hard...  
  
Rules  
1\. Add EMA 30 to chart  
2\. Follow the trend  
3\. Long at next open bar when Bullish _**Engulf**_ bar is formed above EMA30, and short at next open bar when Bearish **_Enguld_ **bar is formed below EMA 30.  
4\. Use Finbonacci to determine SL and TP

> Simple Tip: Add Stoc with 8,3,3 settings, then wait for the new bar, because usually a retracement will happen after the engulfing bar is closed. Plot your fibo just like the instructions, and wait for the retracement around 61.8 or 50, then you can say that its a valid engulfing bar. Then trade it. Also refer to the support and resistance it might give you an idea where the trend will end.

This is a very good observation. Place a pending around 50% retrace and can get better RR, like shown in pic. 25x65 pips ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

It seems to be valid buy, but it's not coz Gold has been ranging for a while now... Wait until it breaks the range, but I could be wrong though...   
  
Just giving you additional insights.. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) That is why you're good with using small lot size.. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Vince.  
  
Thats exactly why the smaller lot sizes.  
Have been selling high and buying low all week on Gold due to the ranging nature of the pair, just been using tight SL and trailing as soon as i move into profits on it.  
The Pending Buy order is at 1295.2  
am currently short on it from 1294 looking to retest 1289 handle again.  
Trade safe and keep taking the pips the market gives...they all add up at the end of the day.

This is a engulfing?  
I checked the trend and it is downward, I would like to understand if I'm reasoning well. I noticed that it is not perfectly a engulfing.  
but I would like an opinion from some expert, I'm in profit but I would like to understand if I'm reasoning well. Thanks

Hello! Why did you knock the EURCHF breakeven if the price did not reach Fibo 150?

Not quite sure what you mean - your trade did hit 150 fib level. See below from your screenshot.

technically yes, but i don't like how it's at the top of the range and not a swing low  
  
it means that i think it probably is going to retrace before going up again

This is the problem with candles H4, D1 ... which will be different, from one time zone to another.  
  
You are using a utc +11 timezone (are you from Australia?)  
I am UTC 0 (London)  
  
The formation of the candle H4 will be different.  
I think a closing H4 difference of 2 hours between us.

Hello traders  
  
See the attached results i get from my charts for January 2019.  
Although i don't take every trade in my real trading, and i certainly don't risk 4% per trade, i love doing these tests to see what's possible.  
The number in the far right bottom cell is certainly a great motivator.

  1. i take every signal in these tests, except the candle that closes African time midnight and 4am.
  2. my server time is GMT+2
  3. i consider an outside bar a signal: high and low exceeds previous bar, no matter body colour of prior bar.
  4. for this test i did not apply split positions, one position of 4% only, if it doesn't reach fib200 it's a loser.

124% is not a bad number to start the year with. If only i could achieve this in real trading.

Good advice! Indeed yes.  
Think i'll increase lot size in small increments instead of doing anything drastic.  
All the backtesting has given me confidence in this system.

Different time zones = different candle formations. Some traders will have engulfing (trading signals), other won't. It's not rocket science.

That's what I explained just above.  
Personally I still work on the London and sometimes NY times zones , for obvious reasons.

Or, you increase the volume and set 1.5 Fibo as TP. And after a while, confront with that nasty dilemma: should it be a Porsche or a Ferrari ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1))

On tradingview you can set different time zones too, same functionality as you broker platform offers. So using tradingview won't make a difference I guess.

Hi Guys, EURUSD gave a valid signal on the DAILY.  
Now i know the System Rules are more aligned and focused to the H4. But as once mentioned, another confirmation can be looked at on the daily.  
Tuesdays candle gave an engulfing pattern that seems to be playing our at the moment.

Hello mitroiano  
  
Is it wise? TP at 150? It will make our losers larger than our winners.  
This system is not flawless, it does generate a fair amount of losers.  
We don't want them greater than our winners in value.  
  
Please tell me, is this how you trade? And your profits are good?  
Porsche or Ferrari?

Based on your tests and observations, 150 Fibo is being hit most of the times. The RR is theoretically 1:0.5 but since you open the trade at the end of the candle and not the end of the bar, the RR is better (the wick ads to your profit and takes from the risk). I have a feeling that by adapting the method this way one would increase his earnings.  
  
I am more of a swinger, but I also used this method (the original one, TP at 200) in a couple of occasions with good results.

Setting different time zones just changes the timestamps on your chart, the candles don't change.

Though all long-run gains are good, there are pairs with a prolonged downturn or big losses.

That's always the best way to do things anyway. Have all your charts on whatever computers you have and then keep your live broker completely on is own on the fastest machine you can manage. That way, your trade execution speed isn't slowed down by the amount of charts/indicators/templates you have open and running in the background. All the trade management machine is doing is placing and managing the trades.

unfortunately if the historical data are not at least 90%, the backtests do not report real data

I think taking multiple trades across multiple pairs smooths out the downturns and upturns.  
This allows you profit from an underlying principle without getting spooked out by a specific pairs behaviour. Bit like a hedge fund.  
  
However..... (as per vianiahs post)  
  
AUDUSD: over approx 1500 trades, equity gain of approx 860: that about 50c per trade?  
EURUSD: over approx 3800 trades, equity gain of approx 1800; thats about 60c per trade?  
GBPUSD: over approx 1900 trades, equity gain of approx 1300; thats about 60c per trade?  
Or it that amount per "pip"? In which case, how much was risked per pip/trade?  
If the amounts gained were over 18 years, is that a strong enough edge?  
  
Is that a fair reading?

As you can see, when the market opened last night, the spread was 15+ pips.  
The normal spread in that pair is like 0,6 pips.  
  
This is happen often?  
I don't want to write the name of the broker yet, i'm waiting of their answer.  
UPDATE: they didnt answer anything. It's the [Pepperstone](/brokers/pepperstone "View Pepperstone Broker Profile").  
Nobody open account there.  
  
Beside of that, that trade would be simple reach the TP until now ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1)(

Hey all,  
  
If your looking to avoid choppy areas where price is bouncing up and down the moving average, try to add a RSI 14 filter. 45/55.  
  
If RSI is between 45 and 55, skip the trade.  
  
Cheers

> Hello traders See the attached results i get from my charts for January 2019. Although i don't take every trade in my real trading, and i certainly don't risk 4% per trade, i love doing these tests to see what's possible. The number in the far right bottom cell is certainly a great motivator. i take every signal in these tests, except the candle that closes African time midnight and 4am. my server time is GMT+2 i consider an outside bar a signal: high and low exceeds previous bar, no matter body colour of prior bar. for this test i did not apply...

Hello Helbor, thanks for sharing your backtest results. If I may, I would like to ask a few questions:  
  
1) you mentioned that in your manual backtest, trades that did not hit 200 fib are considered losers, may I know if you move those trades to 100 fib when the prices hit 150 fib in your backtest/real trading? How's the result?  
  
2) you also mentioned that you accept signals from outside bar (higher high, lower low, regardless of body size), may I know if you have a preference over the colors of the engulfing and the engulfed bars?

Hi All,  
  
Is anybody testing this on different time frames? I'm testing at the moment on the 15m TF with success this morning on GBPUSD. Also, slightly different exit strategy, when trade reached 0.5:1 I moved stop to +1, then trail out stop on each candle.  
  
See screenshot attached.

Hello JohnLee97  
  
1\. No, for the testing i don't move the SL. Too many winners get to 150, retrace past entry point and eventually hit 200. In real trading i know it's hard not to fiddle with the SL.  
  
2\. No preference for body colour.   
  
I've tried many different variations of the original strategy to see if i can get better results, but there are losers no matter which way we approach it.   
  
I will however make use of the ATR when trading very large signal candles, (and place my SL and TP accordingly) instead of trying to force a winner out of an exceptionally large candle.

Thank you.   
It's just because we are not on the same time zone, only.   
  
For me, I am looking at the time zone of London. So UTC. (For obvious reasons, managers look mainly at the LO or NY ).  
On Trading View you have 4 feeds with specific time zones for brokers servers.  
  
You do not have to spend your time checking right-left on x timezones.  
Concentrate on your graph, on a single time zone that you think is the best for you.  
  
This is my humble opinion.

The EA can open up to 0.06 lots by putting buy/sell limits or buy/sell stop, and it has 1:1 risk per trade. Also each trade can trigger trail stop if price went beyond 150% on fibo then it will set its tp to 423.6% as the maximum tp. 

Eeh?

Hi Helbor,  
Been using this strategy for a while now with some success, and thank you to very much to HZS10, your comment about moving stop to break even when 150 is hit I would agree with 100% my results have been much better not moving the stop although painful to do at times.

Hey snail69. Are you using the original system posted on first page for your entry and exit or a variation of it ? If it's a variation would you mind explain your entry and exit rules. Just started reading this thread yesterday. I'm not done yet. I just wanna make sure that I'm using the last version of the system if there has been any change like it happens so many times on FF.

Crazy but good day.  
  
In an attempt to calculate fixed % risk at the 4hr rollover i entered too large positions in error and closed a few trades too early. Wish i held on to GBPCHF.  
  
Still in GBPJPY with a partial position. Truly a challenge to practice those backtesting principles in live trading but i shall keep trying.  
Totally missed EURGBP which has already given two excellent opportunities this week.

Hey . Thanks for sharing. I'm new on this thread and still reading while taking a few trades too. Nothing's better than practicing to learn.Are you following the original rules on the first page including moving SL to 100 when 150 hit or are you trading a different version ? Just trying to understand what's everyone's doing. Thanks!

Hello lev10  
  
Whenever i have a moment, i backtest manually and i keep the results in a spreadsheet.  
The backtesting has proven the best approach is to leave the SL alone, but i guess we all have our preferences when it comes to protecting our money.  
Today i could not help myself: my position size on GBPJPY was too large, so i took a partial profit, moved my SL to 100 and got stopped out.   
But i don't feel remorse. Next time with a proper position size i will practice more perseverance.

News knocked me out of this one (spread caused it to hit SL, even though candles don't look like they hit it).  
  
Doesn't matter, can't win them all. Just the cost of doing business...

trades like this i stay away;  
  
1 - the lower wick is telling you that there is buying at that level  
2 - it is not clearly above or below the EMA and bouncing around  
  
only take the 'best' trades and you will end up better off in the long run!

I think he did short the trade, thinking there is selling pressure.   
  
I would say the body of the candle is not giving any directions so should have stayed off the trade.

Yes Lev, but with some own preferences. Principle is to use outside bar above ema 30 to consider trade and direction.  
  
TP according to fibs. Entry immediately after next candle opens.  
  
Here I differ. Personally consider outside bar as mother bar. Then I look for momentum, where Stoch 6,3,3, close/close come into play. On myfxbook will decide position size based on SL level. This I measure from intended open trade price to bottom/top of the mother bar.  
TP mostly a cording to weekly pivots and price action/ candles patterns.  
  
Will open only when indicated RR is >1:1. Risk 1% per trade.

> Crazy but good day. In an attempt to calculate fixed % risk at the 4hr rollover i entered too large positions in error and closed a few trades too early. Wish i held on to GBPCHF. Still in GBPJPY with a partial position. Truly a challenge to practice those backtesting principles in live trading but i shall keep trying. Totally missed EURGBP which has already given two excellent opportunities this week. ***Where is Hsz10?? ***Did she retire? {image}

Bravo !!!  
Do you use a strong lever? Or maybe you have a big capital?  
I still have trouble finding my money management. Initially always open a fixed mini lot, like Hsz10. Then I thought it was better to give each trade the same% risk that I would increase every 15 days, if I was positive + confident in the method.

she is still around, just not replying to the thread as actively as she used to (probably because she has her method nailed down) - i know only because i have seen her liking posts the past few days

Solution on this is Simple....  
  
Keep track of red news for the day and avoid trading that currency involved before news comes out.. After news was released there you can analyze your trades with regards to the involved currency... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60e.png?v=15.1)  
  
_**EDIT**_  
OR probably your broker tricked you and stopped you out.. Just kidding! hehe 

We're not here to be right, we're here to Profit Consistently!

Good trading week on GBP pairs. Still got 1more week to see end results. There are to many voices out there and too many suggestion. If you dont know what you are doing please go learn your basics. You can keep doing your back test, trade in demo acc, set your rules and stick to it.   
  
Dont cry baby when you cant get the results like others. Dont start misleading others by telling people to do this and that. If you get confused, go back to post #2. I have been trading on my phone for the 5th month on this strategy, so far so good. Whether i am at work or overseas. Dont worry, i have been like one of you, hopping from thread to thread finding the “perfect” strategy that would work for me. But none suits me but i dont blame them or start saying funny things in their threads. This will never be perfect startegy like other thread. If the end results satisfy what i looking for i will stick to it. If it does not suits you, simply find another strategy.   
  
Afterall i am glad to see many still doing good on this strategy. Continue to share charts, ask question and share your results. Stay green pips

To everyone in this thread, basic rules on 1st page is already golden, it's up to you if you want to add something else if you're an experienced trader but if you are just new to this.. Just stick with the basics first for a longer period of time,once you're consistently profitable, that's the time you do some of your own modifications...

I have such results so far, but I'm just beginning to understand the system, I think the results will be better. The risk per trade is always 1%.

Missed the GBP pairs this morning. I was sleeping ( 3 AM) when the set up happened, but it's okay. You can't catch any single set up out there. Just entered on this Eurusd though. It's a valid engulfing. The candle is just not completely above the MM30. I'm trading live but I will still give it a try. Do you guys trade that type of engulfing or do you just stick to the one forming completely above or below the MM30 ?

It can be a good entry but for safety i usally skip long/short wich are not above/under the MA30 on D1  
  
Last 5 days trading - lot size 0.1% to 0.4% risk

Agreed,   
  
Food for thought.   
  
What I personally do is when the profit reaches 30 pips or somewhere near or price hits the 150 level I move to BE.

Correct! We dont just set and forget. We also have to be responsible on managing our trades so we can protect our profits and not let it turn to losses

Alert.  
  
watch out for AUDxxx pairs printing bearish engulfing candle after news.. Wait for 4h candle close or if the candle is too long, wait for 61.8% retracement to have a better price entry..

these are the perfect examples where you can say that there's really no perfect system or strategy. no matter how good it is, there will always be times where you will lose eventhough you followed your plan. that is why you have to control your risk and in the long run, you will still succeed. number one that we should consider is proper money management before anything else.

That is why we were advise to learn the basis first. This system is not just a complete mechanical system if I must tell you. Otherwise you would have just teach a 10 years old child to make money in the long run but I am afraid it won't work that way.  
  
We must also learn to read PA. I don't see anyone crossing the road blindfolded and expect not to be crushed.   
Personally, I won't take any of those trades.

This is trading into supply/resistance whatever you wanted to call it. These are the basis of forex that must be learnt first.

Do you think there is complete mechanical system without using your brain?  
  
Do you also mean Support/Resistance does not exist?

_**''...whatever you wanted to call it.''**_ ?  
  
I agree with your sentiment, however traders should be aware that there is a difference between Supply+Demand Zones (which I trade) and Support and Resistance Lines (which I don't).  
  
That's S+D on your chart, though missing a number of minor zones.  
  
Even if a trader doesn't use S+D directly in their day-to-day method, it is a worthwhile study to get a grasp of what is going on in the landscape around you, especially in the higher time frames (as in your H4 examples and above).

Thank you for buttressing it. That is exactly what I was saying. There is no doubt that the system works very well. In fact, I have added it to my trading arsenal but I won't take all setup. I know that from experience anyway and that is my message for newbies. OP said it that one should learn basis of trading first.

Couple of winners to kick off the day and one hit SL also.  
  
Let's see if I can reverse my string of losses from yesterday.

This is how I trade the daily chart. I will post a new graph update later...  
Just to re-cap, I take every signal, I set pending orders at the high or low of the engulf candle and set SL at high/low and TP is 150fib, I do not care about any directional bias, ( I follow indicator direction...no MA used either) I use a fixed position size on all trades, if a trade has not triggered and a candle closes beyond SL I cancel trade, if a trade is active and an opposite signal shows up but does not hit SL I close with a small loss, if a trade is open and I get a close beyond 1/2 way to 150fib I close and finally if a second signal of the same direction shows up during an active trade I will open a second trade at twice the position size.  
The backtest results show the high win rate I feel is needed to trade this way...

Hey JPM  
  
I am doing well with this...  
I have two graphs to show, 1 is a set of new daily trades since Jan 11 2019  
  
The second is from Sept. 27 2018, the time I started testing live. This graph has two really big false moves because of wrong position sizes the small positive one was a gain of $250+/- the other catastrophe was a whopper at a loss of $800+/-. This is why I started again as I did not have a good idea of how it is going.  
  
Note: The end of graph two is graph one.  
  
Chris

Well done you made good pips. May I ask, do you open trade on the open of the new bar AFTER the engulfing bar?

As I thought, using **NO** TS but only TP and SL, is much better for my performances!

Ideal is when there is an outside bar and at the same time body is engulfed as well. This happening close to ema 30, well there is to be a ride. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
My TPs are around weekly classic pivots. There are often very interesting RRs.

This happens as well. Setup - outside bar and engulfed body, crossing 8 ema is often a start of a major move like showed in the picture.

I do not see any valid engulfing at where you are pointing.

Looks like a valid engulfing to me but generated by news.  
  
Engulfing generated by news should be ignored I think, at least that's what's caused me big losing streak last week.

HI AkronD, in the first case was an engulfing created by a news, something artificial and avoiding the future, and in the case of two, you had a consolidation area before, so to avoid it.   
  
You do not have to take all the positions, the secret in forex, from my point of view, are the positions you do not take, those with the low rate of success.

In my opinion I feel with this method you need to take every signal. NO MATTER WHAT!!!  
  
I can show you many examples of filtered trades that did not make it and I can show you trades that looked bad but made it.  
  
I will add that I trade differently than page 1. This difference is why I do not filter trades, I have tested close to a thousand trades on over a dozen pairs going back 5 years in some pairs and I am confident in trading this without filters.  
  
If you look back a few pages you will see how I trade and which pairs to use (win rates over 65%)

After such huge candle there is to be a pullback, especially when it is end of AB=CD.

Here you were buying into Supply/Demand zone.  
Big round number 110.00, lots of spikes...  
  
Have different candles as my 4 h interval is other. On the other hand there is a signal outside red candle with bodies engulfed, closed crossing 8 ema, signaling a major move down.

Same here. Price crossed ema 30, crossed as body engulfed outside candle and closed under 8 ema.  
  
Now it is a free trade.

Thanks for the good feedback mate. Can i ask how you were able to correlate the news? Do you follow a process? I don't think Post #1 and #2 talk about news although i can see how news can clearly send trades in all directions.

Okay, i think all the trading systems fall in similar pit traps. Whenever trades go pear shape, its always about a SR or some strange level which i didn't spot. Your comments are interesting - so you are trading this strategy devoid of Price Action?

Actually to me it feels like a consolidation period. I can see that there are no high highs, but there are higher lows. Another reason i was expecting this one to work.   
  
Thoughts?

Looks like a 'news-candle' to me. Usually those candles do not produce valid signals.

Close to previous, recent resistance. Be careful, if you take these trades make sure you cover in time.

I think I missed the TP by a pip or so, even if I included the 10 pips spread taken by my broker.  
Still into the trade, I think it will hit that level again.

I would be weary about trading at a resistance level.   
I would wait for it to break this level and then look for engulfing bars as confirmation.

It depends a bit on the time frame. For H4 i would go back and just see how often the price has met resistance at that level, even if it's just once it's possible it will be resistance, you just have to look at price action at these levels to get an idea of if it will reverse or breakout. There are many factors to consider, just what I personally look for.   
Maybe look back a couple months for more recent levels, sometimes levels from a year ago can be valid, but personally I look for obvious levels where possibly the majority of traders would look for (self fulfilling prophecy etc).

Most of what you said sounds reasonable to me, I think if you look back a year, do you think you will almost always find a resistance or a support level?

I had to zoom in a check again - you are right that there is no strict engulfing bar. Unfortunately I was working off a laptop so wasn't as clear as I thought it was.  
  
Great thing about tradingview is that there are scripts to help me with that. I've added a script that helps me paint engulfing bars now so hopefully no more problems.

guys i have to admit that chasing losers is a dangerous game...i have fallen for the trap and lost quite a bit of money doing this today.  
  
i am going to go back to what works for me, and that is back to the basics;

  1. engulfing bar above 30ema for long, below 30ema for short - enter at opening of new bar
  2. move sl to 1.0 fib level when price reaches 1.5
  3. only trade when i am at a computer, trading on mobile does not work for me
  4. risk the same amount each trade - this will be small enough that i do not worry about the trade and look at it every 5 seconds

i could easily start a new trade explorer and hide my losses but today i got greedy trading cfds and after a good win thought i could win back all my losses with an over-leveraged trade (i.e. gambling).  
  
instead i will go back to what works and trade the system. i will be profitable again, and you will be here to witness it  
  
cheers

my friend, this candle does not qualify as a legitimate engulfing bar and also even if you traded it, it did not reach TP.  
  
please read the rules again

Looking forward to your posts. I'm doing the same thing, unsuccesfully. Can you elaborate your thought process especially the things you are looking at outside of those 4 things.

I think there are lots of definitions of what constitutes an engulfing candle - I know Hz put up a definition (the body of todays candle must engulf previous body and also todays h must be higher than yesterdays h and todays l must be lower than yesterdays l) but then she put up a few pics where that definition was adhered to (the engulfing body was less than yesterdays body.

In real trading i know it's hard not to fiddle with the SL. 2. No preference for body colour. I've tried many different variations of the original strategy to see if i can get better results, but there are losers no matter which way we approach it. I will however make use of the ATR when trading very large signal candles, (and place my SL and TP accordingly) instead of trying to force a winner out of an exceptionally large candle.

helbor - how is your trading going?  
  
i look at my trade again and it would've hit TP if i left it altogether. is leaving it to hit SL or TP working for you?

The week so far.  
Increased my position size this week so losses are bigger (I try and risk a fixed % per trade)  
I still get some sizings wrong during the rollover; only have myself to blame for the negative result.

> In my opinion I feel with this method you need to take every signal. NO MATTER WHAT!!! I can show you many examples of filtered trades that did not make it and I can show you trades that looked bad but made it. I will add that I trade differently than page 1. This difference is why I do not filter trades, I have tested close to a thousand trades on over a dozen pairs going back 5 years in some pairs and I am confident in trading this without filters. If you look back a few pages you will see how I trade and which pairs to use (win rates over 65%)...

Hi Chris,  
In your extensive backtest on dailies I just have a question to clarify something for me please. If you get an 65% win rate on an R:R of 1:0.5 obviously that is only break even so I presume you don't mean 65% as I am understanding it. I have tried it now but just for two weeks, too small a sample I know, but so far win rate 5 wins to 1 loss.  
Look forward to your reply,  
Brian.

Hi All Great Forum  
I have a trade running NZDJPY 4h I am not sure how to take profit, should I close at target 100 or wait to target 200. What about Breakeven?  
I am sure you are all experienced trader, so apologies if I should know this.  
Hope you can help.  
Ian

TP is up to you - 150% or 200%  
  
SL is moved to BE when price gets to 150% level.  
  
I think the rules for setting TP/SL are in the first few posts

Hi Brian214  
  
I tested with a take profit of 150 fib, and did the calculation between wins divided by total trades and traded only pairs where the result was 65% or higher.  
  
You are saying a much higher win rate would be needed to achieve profitable results?  
  
Would you be so kind as to show the math on this please.  
Is it 65%*.05=32.5 and 35%*1=35  
So we need somewhere around 68%?  
  
Chris

Enter on 61.8 fib retracement, best option. Or go with 50%, all up to you..

_Updates_  
  
Jan has a total increment of 14.7% in profit. Nothing changes, follow everything stated in post #2.   
  
Traditional information always teach management %risk. However i would like to say if you are in the learning process or testing a strategy, sticking to a fixed lot size can train your discipline and and trading psychology. If you cant afford to lose the amount you risk, trade the smallest lot size 0.01 for a period.   
  
I have traded 0.1 lot size for the 5th month and see a constant result of profit in, and i dont increase when i see a good profit in. Reason you dont when when the market will turn against you.   
  
Stay green pips

You are saying a much higher win rate would be needed to achieve profitable results? Would you be so kind as to show the math on this please. Is it 65%*.05=32.5 and 35%*1=35 So we need somewhere around 68%? Chris

Hi Chris,  
Thanks for coming back. Yes I was simply saying if you win 5 dollars 65% of the time and you loose 10 dollars 35% of the time obviously you are going nowhere with that. Even 68% would make it very marginal. Maybe I have misinterpreted what you are saying do you mean that for every 65 euros you win you also loose 35 euros obviously that would be much better.  
So far the strategy looks much more positive to me but I am long enough trading to know a small sample is quiet meaningless which is why I was interested in your backtest.  
Brian.

I think a % would be a more accurate way of doing things, so if you have 50 pips or 100 pips stoploss its going to be 2% risk.  
So lets say 100 pips risk is 0.1lots if you find a trade with 50 pips you can trade 0.2 lots that way everything is constant and you will get a more accurate performance report.  
  
Just my 2%

I am also testing this strategy with real account 250 dollars with 0.01 lot  
once I will have confidence then I will increase my account and lot size  
yes u can survive but if u have only 100 dollars then test it with demo account ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

What I suggest is if the new setup is in the same direction as the open trade I double my position size on the second trade.  
  
If the setup is in the opposite direction I close the open trade and open a new trade in the direction of the new setup.

Heck stopped out on the second lot. Its too volatile and could've let it run to 150 before setting the Sl as per the rules. I would have if it was a sensible lot size like 0.1 or 2. Would still be in as its not retraced back to 0 even though it seems to be a resistance at the 100. All the Brexit uncertainty is great lol

Would you take this trade again as it has retraced or just look for another trade?

Did you hit your original target? Looks to me in my humble view that this is shaping up to consolidate. The spike was a reaction to something. Probably news looking at the time you posted and working back. You have support across 1.406 and potential for resistance at 1.124. The big candle on the 31st was a reaction to news and this is the buyers completing their moves. The channel has also broken so you might want to wait a moment to see if a new trend forms or if you are in fact stuck in consolidation. That's my view. Don't bank on it :-)

Not to be rude but plenty have already shared their results on this. At this stage of the thread IMHO it's either you do the back testing yourself or you have a look at the setups that are being discussed on the day and go back to your charts and see what PA did.   
That's the only way you will learn and become entirely independent in your thought and logic when it comes to trading.   
Again not being rude rather looking to help you learn and see what works best for "YOU"

You are most welcome, one thing to try is find your support or resistance line and when it is clear it is an S&R then draw a channel/ trend line and see if it fits. You probably see that it broke the trend and headed south. To draw lines I use the middle of the bar closes where possible and try to aim for where price swings as confirmation points that the trend line is true. With some practice you'll get there. Many green pips to you.

Morning Traders.  
  
Looking at EURJPY today. Looking for a deeper pullback in order to minimize overall risk. But setup is valid and confirmed. Trade safe

Hi bud.   
  
It's a valid entry but if you don't wanna carry the heavy DD enter closer to the median.   
It reduces your DD and also reduces potential risk should your SL be filled.   
  
Hope that helps

Just went long will reduce lot size at 100 then look to let trade run. Just to minimise risk and lock in profit.  
SL at 1.59349

imo its long.you ask why?look at price.only thing you can control is your risk not target.I better set sl below the candle and go long(smaller sl)and tp at beginning of egulfing (bigger possible tp).I know that trade already happen.but what I want to say that I better look go oposite after engulfing

Hi ficibald,  
  
Shorting at the top would have been profitable indeed. I've been stopped out. Can you share what you can see that made you want to short?

Thanks for the insight - I think there is some sense in what you're saying but I don't quite follow how to see when stops are being taken out, or when it is a smart money move.

New to this thread, like the system. Still reading though. Entered long on GBPNZD, even though GBP is weak today because of news, hopefully it'll pick up during the day or rest of week.

I followed this strategy, with 0.01 fixed for this month (still has to finish) analyzing the report of mt4, it is clear that the large candles lead to a stop loss so large, and therefore the average value of losses exceeds the average value of winnings. How do you behave with big candles?

Mean reversion. Enter the position when price is close to the mean the stop is just above or below the engulfing candle depending on whether you're buying or selling. once price breaks out,I take partial profits move SL to BE and let the trade run risk free.   
This prevents heavy DD

sorry but seeing my little English I want to be sure I understand: you intend to enter a 50% retracement of the big candle?

this is what happened since January 20th. Now, I'm at 9% drawdown. Obviously that the periods so there are for each strategy, I will wait at least 3 months before giving a sentence.

That is an aggregate account over several fx pairs.  
Can you establish if this is a general pattern, or whether some pairs are less profitable than others?  
Also, don't forget, for those currencies that are correlated, you are essentially taking multiple positions.  
This might magnify losses and gains.  
Still, early days.  
Do you have a cut-off point, where you abandon this method?

I am strictly following the rules of the topic creator, following his own currency pairs. I thought like you, the matched pairs magnify gains and losses, for example many trades at the same time were on gbp which caused the greatest losses. I gave myself a 3 month time, to evaluate the strategy.

1: if these results are generated from this strategy so i think u should go and read post no 2 again and think are u using same rules which is mentioned in post no 2 ?????  
  
2: check post no 2210 and match your results with thread owner trading results from 20th january to 31st of january  
  
3: your results shows u have only taken 65 trades in 24 days, but thread owner took more than 55 trades in last 10 days of january

I'm not inexperienced, and I'm sure I'm following the rules carefully. I do not need to read the post again.  
These exchanges were made only on engulfing taking into account only high and low and not the body, and long only above 30 and vice versa short.  
The only reason it can change the number of trades is the fact that different brokers show different candles, and the fact that I go to sleep at midnight and my trading starts at 11 with the second candle h4 of the day.

gian97,  
  
Are you using the same broker time as the OP?  
One of the peculiarities I noticed was that the 4hour bars are different based on broker times.  
This will affect the size and shape of your 4hour bars.

No, I do not use the same broker for sure .. I think the problem is due to when gbp has made so many giant candles, which has shifted the average of losses higher than the average profit, widening the stop loss.  
We also consider that there are several cross gbps, and that I have therefore opened many similar operations together.

Ryan the strategy is profitable my man.  
If you have a bearish or bullish engulfing the best thing is to wait for price to revert to mean and rather sell or buy around the mean. Not only does it reduce your DD, it helps minimise the losses. So instead of waiting for that breakout enter at the mean. This way your loosers are smaller in scale when compared to your winners.

No worries bud. The engulfing bars are a signal bit remember nothing is Holy grail. All we can do as traders is minimise our risk and improve our money management.   
Keep on keeping on

I'm thinking of using a longer-term moving average to check timeframe above 4h and operate only if they are aligned. What do you think ?

Don't start again looking for new holy grails based on this system. Some weeks are like these, in any system. Don't judge a system on a 2 weeks performance, with H4 candles. Hit the punch bag at the gym for a few hours, read posting #1, start trading again and stick to the original system. Or hop to a new system, and find the same. I believe consistency is golden, but hard to learn for many. That includes myself though. No offence btw.  
  
have a great weekend.

I think the problem is due to when gbp has made so many giant candles, which has shifted the average of losses higher than the average profit, widening the stop loss. We also consider that there are several cross gbps, and that I have therefore opened many similar operations together.

The problem is not the strategy, the op has shown that it is profitable. I think the problem is given by the fact that depending on the gmt the candles are different, and this leads to open different operations, that's all.

I do not know, probably the best thing is to look through the posts of those who presented the strategy, and see if he mentioned his gmt.

go to first page of this thread onwards, and look at the charts she posted.  
then try to match up the bars and see.  
you can deduce which hours make up the 4-bar grouping.  
  
Probably best to seek out her charts rather than anyone elses, just to stay as close to OP set-up as possible.

Tried to see why price turned yet the engulfing was legit only to find that price bounced off the 200 simple moving average...try to place it on your chart and see for yourself....the sma 200 is very powerful especially onbthe H4 timeframe

Not stopped out, as I would have entered this trade with a stop-order. But price never hit 100% line, so no trade would have been taken.

Sorry it was a response to post #2196 .  
The sma 200 acts as support & resistance mainly on H4 charts

Hi, I am new here but trading this system from October. The thread is very quiet last days, How was February results?  
  
For now those are my monthly results: +4,9%, -1,9%, +1,3%, +3,6%.  
  
Not impresive results but I think they are ok, so I only trade 12 pairs and only London sesion, I made an average of 20 trade/Month.  
  
I think It is a good system and I have room for improvement I' ll continue trading it next months.  
  
I am looking forward to Hzs10 results.

imho, I think you can try exactly this but with adjusting lot size so that every trade win or lose is the same : ) I think it's more objective to volatility

is It done taking every signal?  
  
not bad results but I am sure the results wil be improved this way:  
  
\- Only candles from Asian open to London close. (I did some stats that confirm this)  
\- Excluding too big/small candles.  
\- Candle colour agree with our trade.  
\- Avoid flat MA.  
\- Not reflected in bactesting but spread increase on rollover is a killer for small SL/TP trades.If I can I try to avoid overnight trades

Interesting.  
You have identified an active time range.  
Have you had a look at the London/Frankfurt Opening Range strategy? Do you think the underlying principle makes sense?  
Do you think it has an edge?  
The asian 4-hour bar pattern you look for represents some kind of market behaviour. Yes/No?  
  
If you believe the above, would it make sense to consider that Tokyo/ HK might also have an opening range behaviour?  
If so, would it make sense to look at the hours the asian sessions open, rather than have it obscured within a 4-hour bar?  
Might be worth a look.  
Then the strategy is understood in the context of institutions behaviour and their wakey times rather than just a bar on a chart.  
You might get in earlier and/or have a tighter entry/SL rather than using "Fibs". Do you think this might refine your edge?  
  
You seem to have added a good filter (times). Thought you might want to extend your logic to fine-tuning which bar you are trading.  
Not guaranteeing anything, but thats how I would look at it.  
  
Apologies if this is off-topic, but this thread does seem to have lost some momentum.  
Best wishes.

_There would be only 6 candles a day, so if we subtract overnight candle, we would subtract a large number of those trade too, besides, I find that even at these overnight time, there wouldn't add to losing streak much. In fact, I find out that most of the losing trade was in EU and SA season haha (OC in my experience).  
_Those big fat candle generate more win than lose, it just blew my mind.  
_When any trade which had its wick or body touch the MA, that wasn't count. As a result, most of the trade was safe from sideway itself.  
_You were right about overnight trade, but since we are trading in H4, the spread isn't that much problem as we did in intraday trading.  
  
_I will try backtesting again but this time in H1, or higher R:R, or something like that.

For euraud, the rule said: when there is a bearish engulfing bar under ma, then short. I don't think euraud meets the rule.

Hi DB, thanks for bringing that up, I did not notice that, but will take that into account from now. Are you trading this system yourself? How you're getting on with it?

I did refer this idea. I also print out 4hr charts, and manually check which engulfing success and which fail. I found small engulfing and engulfing at the extreme fails.

Good idea about the printing. For that purpose I will change my charts template to a white background colour, so I can do the same.

I would not have taken that trade, higher lows, forming of funnel, and price is just flocking around the EMA going nowhere. It's waiting to break out of that funnel.

Update EURNZD  
  
Luckily I did not take that trade. Candle did not finish as engulfing, also FOMC day and red news ahead.

Hey there,   
  
Hope you've had a profitable week.  
  
Great to see how active you are on this thread, how long have you been trading this method out of curiosity? I'm going to work my way through the entire thread to catch up but it seems very promising indeed.  
  
Have you worked out an average success rate for your positions?  
  
Currently I'm more of an intra-day trader with some scalping in between, always interested in trying something longer term and this method seems like it could hit the spot.  
  
Have a great weekend.

Hi Davie,  
  
Thanks! I just started to watch this thread recently and now trying to keep it alive. At least for myself as diary lol. Day trading yes been there done that, I found it exhausting watching 28 pairs every 5 minutes and stressed out to the max to win a pip or two is not my cup of tea. So I switched to this idea using H4 candles, friendlier for the eye and heart. Hopefully the thread starter will come around to join back in. She is being missed.  
  
Have a great trading week.

How is this ranging? Higher highs and higher lows? EMA30 pointing up?

Good work as it got me involved seeing it was still alive!   
  
So are you trading full time?   
  
Yeah day trading can be hard on the blood pressure! That's why I only scalp 2 pairs from the 5m charts, my bread and butter comes from a strat I use on the 1h which isn't anywhere near as draining. 4h could be a good add-on for me if this is consistent.

I would not have taken it to be honest as it is forming a funnel, dancing near 200EMA.

Interesting, so you're using the system in conjunction with PA rather than taking every opportunity that presents itself? I noticed your EURCAD shout out wasn't according to the initial rules, i.e the value of the low was higher than the previous candle.   
  
How long have you been trading this live?

Hi Davie no I am not a full time trader. I am paper trading this H4 system since about 3 weeks to give it a try. Sounds like some solid short-medium and long time plans in terms of trading. Hope all works out well for you!

I noticed your EURCAD shout out wasn't according to the initial rules, i.e the value of the low was higher than the previous candle. How long have you been trading this live?

No I use some discretion including body size of set-up candles. I don't trade 'blindly' every setup. Refer to post #48, [https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...1#post11557151](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=11557151#post11557151)

No, I did not take those trades, I only watch engulfing bodies, as in post #48.

Hi traders...  
  
hzs10, thanks for the thread!  
  
Batavia, I'm enjoying watching your posts. You post at the time you take the trade, and results, both good and bad. I will do the same and see how it goes.  
  
Took this USDCAD trade just now, got in late but at around the close of the engulfing bar, so good enough.  
  
EDIT: SL to BE

I thought about trading the usdcad move, but I decided not to based on the stochastic overbought level I'm seeing on the daily. Hope it still works for you guys. I was stopped out of NZDUSD trade yesterday because of the interest rates news, but EURUSD worked like a charm.

Short GU. There is support below, so when and if it gets there, if I'm awake to see it, if it stalls I may take profits early.

Hello to all.  
Many thanks to hzs10!  
  
From myself I want to say that the strategy works and brings income.  
What do I do to trade in +:  
1\. Compliance with the EMA30.  
2\. Control how the candle looks. I take only those trades where the candle 2 completely Engulf the candle 1. Here many colleagues show screens with another patterns, which can not be called Engulf (in hzs10 interpretation). This is clearly not the author’s strategy.  
3\. I also pay attention to the levels of support and resistance. Do not trade in the direction of the close level, trade from the close level if there is a setup.  
4\. Many colleagues discuss strategy and show graphics. You all have different candles H4. You do not notice it?  
At hzs10 screen broker with GMT +2. My broker has the same candles. Of course, you can trade on any GMT broker, but for an objective comparison, you need to use one standard.  
I wish you all a lot of TP and good luck!

Any results feedback for the month of March?  
Which pairs are profitable, which not so?  
Are people here using OPs original method, or has there been any morphing, with additional filters?  
  
Hope you had a good month.

I took profits on my EU trade a bit short of the target as I met my weekly profit goal and it looked like it was going to bounce, which it did.  
  
I think my style is a bit too discretionary for this thread, this is more of a mechanical method. I look at pinbars, railroad tracks, engulfing (not just outside candles), support and resistance, and take profits early quite often.  
  
So I'm gonna pack up my things and move on. I wish everyone happy pipping!

Stop loss hit, but lesson notated in my journal. Whenever I use tradingview, this things tend to happen. When I checked my mt4 web and mt4 at home, there was no signal for GBPNZD. The time difference makes different patterns on the different platforms. Hope, this hasn't happened to a lot of people.

Found an article on reliability of engulfing candles: <https://forexop.com/strategy/engulfing-candle-trade/>  
  
Not sure about reliability of article itself. Thoughts?

Thanks for the many updates BataviaTrade! Are there some stats of your account that you can show? I am wondering if you are making constant money with this strategy, because I haven´t at all and gave up on it as it did not make money for me.

Hi GT,  
No prob. No stats, I am paper trading with Tradingview, great platform but there seems to be no way to produce stats in readable format like date-time-pair-price-buy/sell-profit/loss. Anyway, mostly losses so far so there's nothing to show off there haha.

Hey folks,  
been following this thread for some time and doing some tests. Here's what I found.  
  
1\. The engulfing bar pattern in its unadulterated form was originally developed for stock market. What it entails is the rule where the engulfing candle _body_ overlaps the previous candle's _body_ , which means price gap between the previous close and the engulfing open. However, since the forex market is 24/5, gaps are a rare thing and occur on Mondays mostly, and most of us wisely avoid trading Monday opening.  
Therefore, when it comes to forex charts, we should be interested in engulfing bars whose range overlap the previous candle's range. The engulfing body should be sufficiently large though.  
  
2\. 4H charts vary across different brokers due to their GMT offset. It's okay for other timeframes, but 4H and 1D suffer badly. [FXCM](/brokers/fxcm "View FXCM Broker Profile"), Blueberry seems fine. Alpari can be safely traded during summer time because it's CET and CET clock-changes to daylight saving time for the winter months. It's a headache, really.  
  
3\. I've performed some tests from 2010 (Alpari server) and found the most reliable pair for this strategy being EURUSD. I was astonished to say the least, I expected something like the cable to be more profitable (in fact, gbpusd is also good but not so much as eurusd). I applied some filters of course - bar size, body/range ratio, MA period etc.  
  
4\. MA is all good and nice for automated trading, but when it comes to manual trading you'll be better off trading with respect to support and resistance. **Don't buy into resistance and don't sell into support**. Never. Never even if the MA is OK with it. Nearly all the lost trades the EA had tripped over while testing was trading without respect to the S&R. Use MA for reference only. Candle patterns don't coexist with MA's peacefully.  
  
5\. Add the standard Volumes indicator (Indicators > Volumes > Volumes). It shows growing volume in green, and declining in red. Trade when the volume rises. 

Trust the Awesomeness, monkeys.

according to <https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=863699>  
  
you can have engulf alert from   
If you have telegram. You can join this room created by one of our fellow traders here as well where they send notifications every time there's an engulfing candle forming so you can be aware right away of a possible trade setup...

I actually was subscribed for a while, it does indeed sends signals, including many fake ones. Also, I was unable to validate the signals as it is unclear what time zone the signals are in; meaning, when I checked my charts the moment I received a signal, there was not a single engulfing pattern on my chart for that pair,**in my time zone.** So those signals are not of much use.  
  
Do you have any luck with those Beater Trader signals so far?

I am using Tradingview papertrading, but I can't find any useable stats there so far.  
  
I just made a print screen of the part that I could grab, see attached. There's even no export function. Weird.

Based on that screenshot alone it looks like it hasn't been doing so well? Or are there other trading methods mixed in with this method on your paper trading account?

That is correct, I did not have much luck with this system so far. At least my results are different from TS, or I am doing something wrong. BTW, I am trading this system only.

I was thinking both AUDNZD and AUDJPY became winners because of positive news. Not per se because of the engulfing candle. Thoughts?

Is she entering only specific 4 hour candles? (i.e. Asia session ones, London ones, NY ones?)  
  
Perhaps there is a reason why she turns out profitable and the rest of us cannot replicate it.

Hi  
  
Maybe i could make a suggestion that some of your entries arent exactly correct ?  
  
The OP stated:  
  
2\. Follow the trend  
3\. Long at next open bar when **_Bullish Engulf bar is formed above EMA3_** 0, and short at next open bar when Bearish Enguld bar is formed below EMA 30.  
  
Thanks

I analyse her entries and it seems she enters 8 am, 12pm and 4pm (I assume Singapore time since she appears to be based in Singapore).  
  
This translates to 1am, 5am and 9am London (UTC) time, which makes sense because as London and NY wake up, they follow through with volume. Perhaps try these 3 times only for a bit and see how you go?  
  
I entered one - let's see how we go. This would be the 1am London candle

Closing GBPUSD - in hindsight not such a good entry because so much support to the right. Closed at BE to end the week.

Hi there , overall for last week i got like 18 EUR profit. But it's demo acc and from now on I will use my real acc for this strategy.   
Which I notice that if it's a big big engulf , this should beware to open trade when next candle appear due to a lot of sl.  
My suggestion is that , wait it retrace 50% to enter the trade this should be fine for less sl.  
  
Moreover I did research that why this simple thing make profit.  
well , we use 4hr tf and 30 EMA which mean that we trade follow the trend. and engulf is that bull against bear. so I did zoom in and found that in less tf   
it's pullback and we enter trade on that. Meaning we enter in support lv of faster EMA in smaller tf. And engulf that is more power to moving on.  
  
Sorry for bad English (im not good)

This translates to 1am, 5am and 9am London (UTC) time, which makes sense because as London and NY wake up, they follow through with volume. Perhaps try these 3 times only for a bit and see how you go? I entered one - let's see how we go. This would be the 1am London candle {image}

Hi Ivanyo, have you noticed an improvement in your results when using Singpore timezone in your charts? Also could you explain how you use Singapore time zone in Tradingview? I could change the time zone to Singapore, but that does not change the bar start-/end times.

You can't change what time the bars start/close - that depends on the server of your broker.  
  
Mine is [OANDA](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile") and the daily closes at GMT+2 I believe.  
  
What I mean by Singapore hours is I only take engulfing candles that occur during that time zone, and not others.

Only during Asia session - I don't know what Singapore time because i'm from Australia  
  
For the month of April this strategy returned 9.1% for me, however the start of this month has not been so kind to me so far. Let's see how we go.

Hi all! I've put together a channel where my Bot shows every engulfing candle formed on 30+ instruments and on 3 TimeFrames: H1, H4, D1.  
  
It calculates Stops and Profits accordin to the strategy here described. If you want to join It was a pleasure for me to code that service.

you have to understand, not to trade the engulfing when cross the EMA30, it has not to cross the tail or body of the candle.. it need a little points of distance from the EMA to confirm the trend! You are trading all engulfing and that is not the strategy

Hey everyone, I've just registered to post this. I love the simplicity of this strategy and the effectiveness. I've done a few modifications though and back tested it myself and the results are promising. Basic principles are the same as the OP. Moving average 30 ect.  
  
My rules of entry though aren't exactly the same. I only enter on an engulfing candle only if it's the opposite color of the previous candle, for example enter on a bearish engulfing candle only if the previous was bullish and visa versa.  
  
I draw my fibs from the highest/lowest point of the candle to the close and not the full candle as the close is my entry.  
  
I enter upon the close of the 4H candle and also set a buy/sell limit on the 50% retracement for a second entry. The stop loss for both are 5 pips from the highest/lowest point of the candle.  
  
Take profit for entry 2 (50% entry) is at the 150% level and take profit for entry 1 is at the 200% level though once price has closed at the 150% level and entry 2 has closed I move my SL to entry and close half of my position of entry 1 therefore I'm securing profits and limiting risk and extreme pullbacks.  
  
I don't count pips as I only work with percentage. As the bullish engulfing candlestick pattern is considered one of the strongest I personally use high risk on the strategy. I risk 5% per entry so as you are when price moves to the 150% fib level I've closed and secured 7.5% return and let the remaining 2.5% hit target or be closed.  
  
Any feedback or comments are welcomed and as always happy trading. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Hi Ivanyo.. Really nice charts.. If you don't mind, is it possible for you to share your template (and any specific indicator that enables only the respective engulfing candles to get highlighted in colour). Cheers !

Hello buddy, glad to see your sharing here. One question regarding your modification is that, do you count the legs/wicks of the candles when spotting for an engulfing pattern? Or do you look only at the body of the candles?

Hi everyone, so I started reading this thread, haven't gone through all the pages far from it, but still there's something that needs to be cleared up for me. As the rules are very simple and straightforward, I tested them in an EA that I made, and ran some backtests on different pairs. Always stuck to the H4 timeframe. Ran the tests for the past 5 years. And the results have been disastrous. I mean most of the time it's not even close.  
Here are the results I got from 2015 - 2019:  
EURUSD : +3%, with a -15% max DD  
AUDUSD : -34.5%, with a -41% max DD  
USDCHF : +8.2%, -13% max DD. The results were very inconsistent over the years (lots of big whipsaws in equity curve).  
GBPUSD : +40%, -12.7% DD. Best result.  
USDJPY : -31%, -38%DD.  
USDCAD : -17.7%, -20.6%DD.  
EURGBP : -18.5%, 25%DD. But has been loosing money since December 2017.  
NZDJPY : +5.6%, 11% DD.  
NZDUSD : -7%, -20%DD.  
  
As you see, those results are pretty poor, especially for a 4.5 year period. So it makes me think 2 things:  
\- Either you guys haven't done some proper backtesting and think (rather, hope) that this is a winning strategy but will gradually lose money if applying it.  
\- There is more to the simple rules stated in the first post, and with other rules you end up filtering most of the losing trades.  
  
So there you go, I'm not attacking anyone or trying to troll, but you have to admit the backtest results speak for themselves.

This system simply doesn´t work, easy as that. It´s the same like most other systems here. If you follow the rules, it will lose money, as your backtest shows already. The reason why this seems to be profitable here, is because traders only post their winning trades, so called cherry picking and thats the whole reason this "looks" profitable. None of these traders has shown a longer term live account for this strategy yet and that is because exactly that reason! If you ask them to do so, there is always excuses, like that they do not need to proof anything, blah blah blah... Really sorry to have no better news.

I still testing on this strategy but not every day and every bar like initially i intended to. So this experiment lost its credibility and transparency. Thats the reason i did not update anymore. Because now i trade for leisure.   
  
Like i said in first post. This is a forward test experiment and try it at your own risk. I did not even said it is a proven win strategy.   
  
As you can see my fund is almost back to my initial capital, some factors may be over trading, trading too many pairs, or even loopholes in this strategy. I am still experimenting and observing. So for beginner i suggest trading no more than 5pairs if you want to try.   
  
So fret not i am not posting not because i am in losing due to strategy. I am just trading for leisure and my results are not big enough to give data for this strategy.   
  
No matter what trade safe.   
  
Green pips

Hi hzs  
  
Good to see you return. the experiment hasnt lost its creditability. Do you have statistics which may help you to refine the strategy - I think its a 50/50 strategy  
  
Thanks

I found this strategy to be quite interesting so I have coded a indicator to simplify the strategy and also to scan all the currency pairs.  
I posted in the 'old' thread as well.

after you get the signal and have opened the trade , Im trading on 1 hour charts  
place the stop loss at 0.0 fibo and take profit at 150 or higher fibo ( I have been using 150)  
  
today I have been managing the trades like putting on trailing stops etc and am getting a good win rate ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
  
in the screen shot provided it does not look like my original indi anymore , as I have added some more experimental stuff , like emerging engulfing bars and Im still perfecting and testing it.

Many thanks for this indicator. It solves a lot of headaches. Making an EA out of this will be great for proper management of trades and also a backtest to check the profitability on the long term. Well done @ buju!

So the 1H yielded better results, interesting. Actually, it's not surprising because the 4H is highly broker-dependent. The win\loss ratio is also promising, but look at the disparity between short and long wins - 71% vs 47%. Obviously some kind of trend filter is required.  
  
Given the 71% short win ratio, it might be beneficial to increase the RR. Say, set the TP to 1 RR, then close one half at the 150% fibo level and move the SL to BE. 

Trust the Awesomeness, monkeys.

Just to add we can use volume ( Money Flow Index) and trend indicators ( Average Directional Movement Index) while filtering deals.

@ buju, can you pls do me a favour? The last EA(attached to this post) that was created for this strategy on this thread was programmed for the 4hrs time frame. So it calculates TP and SL based on 4hrs even if you attach it to 1hr. Can you kindly make it adjustable to other time frames just like your valuable indicator?

MFI uses volumes, but there are no such thing as true volumes in the forex. ADX is way too slow today. I'd suggest QQE. Red bars mark loss trades.

Hey timidave,  
from what I can see the EA uses the current TF, it's not bound to the 4H.

No, pls check very well. Apply buju's indicator to 1hr and compare it with a valid trade from the EA on 1hr. It's clear that the take profits from the EA maintains 4hrs fib

The logic is different. Buju's indicator does not use MA, but his engulfing bar definition is actually correct (H1>H2, L1<L2 and C1>C2 for long). The EA's engulfing bar rule follows stock market rules where the body engulfs the previous bar's body.

had a quick look at the ea , problem is with this:  
  
**extern int CandleShift = 6;**  
  
**which effects this:**  
  
int candleLowest = iLowest(NULL,0,MODE_LOW,CandleShift,1);  
double lowest = iLow(NULL,0,candleLowest);  
  
so its taking the lowest / highest price over the last 6 candles  
  
try changing CandleShift to 1 when you startup the ea.

Hi buju,  
lowest seems to be used to set the SL only:  
  
Stopploss = NormalizeDouble(lowest, Digits);  
OrderAngepasst = OrderModify(OrderTicket(), OrderOpenPrice(), Stopploss, OrderTakeProfit(), 0, Yellow);  
  
The EA logic needs to be changed but I see no use in that. IMO, it's not the kind of strategy that can be fully automated to produce good results.

@ SkippyTheCan, pls if you can change the logic to trade more correctly, pls do. I've actually seen an EA using this strategy perform very well (80% and above success rate) in an 8 months bactest. It all depends on your settings sometimes. The EA I'm even talking about was released on this thread long time ago. But it still had bugs and the source code was not released.

I've actually seen an EA using this strategy perform very well (80% and above success rate) in an 8 months bactest. It all depends on your settings sometimes. The EA I'm even talking about was released on this thread long time ago. But it still had bugs and the source code was not released.

I've seen it of course. If you'll take a look at the report, you'll see EngulfEAv2.ex4 is a completely different beast. It places buy stop and sell stop orders rather than market orders. Obviously there's something else. There's no indication to the additional criteria it uses for decision making. Too bad there's no source code.  
  
I've modded degu35's EA, feel free to play with it. Don't expect much though; as I said, it's completely different. I also added a couple of other options.

It calculated a stop loss and take profits of more than 160 pips in its first trade hear. What could be the reason?

You know, I've been looking at the trades cybercoder's ea made, and from what I see there's actually no other hidden criteria.  
  
The trick is to place pending orders instead of market orders. In fact, it's the only correct way to trade engulfing bars (and inside bars, for that matter). That's why his ea's win rate is so high. He actually said it in the previous post: _"Default settings are fine and it uses Breakout instead of opening orders rightaway. I tested many times and Profit Factor is much better , and it doesn't change the pips earned."_ ([https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...0#post11728200](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=11728200#post11728200))  
  
Maybe I'll change degu35's code to place pending orders if I find the time these days. Anyway, for manual trading we can now definitely use breakout trading for better wins. 

Trust the Awesomeness, monkeys.

well some good news, ive modded the ea to reflect my manual trading this week with a extra little tweak that i wanted to apply anyway , so i incorporated that into the ea , geez , it was some head scratching there .....  
  
anyway here is the the results of almost 2 years back testing on the 1 hour on eurusd, all it does is vindicate my manual strategy because the ea works on a static set of rules , whereas I will trade more dynamically.  
  
im not going to release the ea just yet because im not entirely happy with it atm , reason is ea is on a 1:1 risk : reward ratio and that im not happy with.  
  
btw i dont trust cybercoder's results , there is no proper report or screenshots , and he's disapeared from the forum...hmm.

@ Skipper, you're absolutely correct, there's no hidden criteria, the secret was pending orders. Thats the way to trade this strategy, i remembered telling the original poster then, but he did'nt respond

The trade was taken from the 1hr chart. I also posted the daily chart so you can see that the stop loss is too far away

Cool work buju! Yeah, you're vindicated. There's potential in your strategy! Continous tweaking of the settings or an optimization will get the best results. Cybercoder was also using 4 hrs timeframe, pending stops and a very conservative take profit settings which depended on the size of the enqulfing candle(price action) which helped his win rate greatly!

Are you both saying to put a stop order at the break of the engulfing bar? As apposed to entering as soon as the new bar opens? Thank you 

Wow! I've got some experience to gain.

Hi Hzs10.  
  
Thank you for the best mobile strategy I have ever used. Simple, quick, reliable and stress free trading thru out the day while busy with other activities. Quick to check and adjust BEs. I use RSI 50 as a extra confirmation and works well.   
  
Much blessings and success to you

@Horizero  
  
I placed a trade this morning (27th May at broker time of 00:00) on EURUSD according to rules stipulated on first page.  
Only modification is I have set my TP at 161 fib and SL at 50% fib.  
  
So far its tracking well - about half way towards my profit target.  
  
It is the first time I have used this strategy since coming across this thread a few days ago.

[quote = vianiah; 11664954] Tato strategie je zajímavá, vydělala z ní pár eur. Problém je v tom, že pokud jste zaneprázdněni a nemůžete sledovat všechny grafy, ztratíte velkou příležitost, když přijde. Řešením je, že jsem vytvořil EA, který monitoruje všechny páry na trhu, major, nezletilé, exotické nebo kovy, a posílá mi upozornění prostřednictvím svého telefonu, abych si je mohl ověřit a obchodovat. Dobrá práce na strategii. Poznámka: Vždy zvažte také, zda v dané době existují zprávy, protože se může stát cokoli. Happy Trading. {image} [/ citát]

You are on the right track. The candle pattern you are using is very good for trading.  
  
Personally, I would get rid of the 30 MA. Instead, I would use a currency strength meter in combination with RSI period 14. Anything above 55 on RSI is bullish, and anything below 45 is bearish. Ideally, I want to see H1, H4, D1, and W1, all agree. But 3 out of 4 will suffice. For further directional confirmation, I would like to trade strength. This is where a currency strength meter comes into play. Here is a [free one](https://currencyquake.com/daily/). I would use the Daily to measure strength. If you can find one that provides data for H8, that would be even better!  
  
Example: Suppose I am trading EURUSD. I want to see at least three of the four time frames (mentioned above) all moving in the same direction on the RSI. Let's say H1, H4, and D1 are all above 55 on the RSI. Then I am bullish on EURUSD. However, I also want to check the Daily currency strength meter for further confirmation that EUR is stronger than USD. If everything lines up, then I will be looking to buy on a minor retracement when I see a bullish engulfing candle.  
  
I would especially be interested in placing orders at or near key areas of support and resistance where engulfing candles show up, such as psychological levels (wholes and halves).  
  
As for the 200 fib target, I might use that. However, I would be more interested in making whole numbers my target. For example, if I buy EURUSD at 1.14, then my target will be 1.15 (100 pips away). I might also consider using supply and demand zones as targets, and perhaps Weekly pivot points. If price turns against me strongly and I am in profit, then I might consider getting out entirely or closing out 50% of my trade and moving my stop loss to break even. It all depends on the market conditions. As traders, we must be able to adapt to the market, making changes to our plans when needed.  
  
Note, this is not financial advice. It's just my personal opinion on how I might trade this candle pattern.  
  
Green pips! 

Learn from your mistakes and march on.

Hello traders !  
  
Just an aditional filter to this strategy. You can add an inside bar. So , the pattern will be 3 bar pattern which must improve accuracy. Also you will close the trade at the close of next bar and focus on the next trade . This will reduce your stress by holding trade longer than you can manage emotionaly. Any programers to do a backtest with this filter ?  
  
Or,  
  
To reduce overtrading even more we can consider only one of this patern per week ( the first) and per instrumet( major+minors only)

And if we hold only 4 hours we can trade also counter trend. The role of moving average can be in some cases ignored !

This system must have a winrate between 50 and 60 pp but becouse we will have some trades with rr greater than 1 on the long term the balance should go up !

Four alarms per day. Only one open trade open per 4h interval. Mt4 candle close is New York close.

Who is interested to trade this strategy we can form a group and when a pattern occurs we can vote for that trade or against. Write in private message your number and I will ad you to whatsap group. Also we need some criteria to select the traders who will have voting rights. Any idea ?

I am interested in this strategy and working on it. We can form a group as you discussed but problem is we all have different brokers with different closing and opening time of the candle and for 4 hrs candle it will really makes difference. How can with cope with it?

We can open a comon demo account on some broker with New York candle close and use that charts for decisions and after that we can open trades on our individiual accounts.

No... at NY close start a new D1 candle and the first H4 candle of the day. Many brokers offer this timing !

Ok Can you name one, lets open a demo and trade based on it. I am not considering only engulfing candle rather I will look for three setup.  
  
Hammer and inverted hammer, Dogi and Engulfing.

Instead of searching for several patterns we can trade the same pattern on other time frame : H8, H12 or D3. Tihis wiil bring a few additional trade with very high quality ! I prefer D3 becouse not interfere with intraday H4 also I prefer weekly and Monthly !

I appreciate your contributions to this thread. It's unfortunate that the person who started it is no longer active.   
  
And yes, I think it is best to use this strategy on more than one time frame. 

Learn from your mistakes and march on.

The problem of strategy of person who started this discussion is that give too many entry and this increase the chance to have a long series of losses. Also she use fib level as targets and I think that is not support our ttrading psychology. Better use a time target plus a profit level at some s/r zone.

Switched to Daily time frame. Strategy are the same :an inside bar falowed by an outside bar. Holding time is one day or close 1/2 and move your risk to break even.

Good morning Viktor, I have seen this strategy for some time but I would like to hear from someone who has tried it without being the creator.  
I noticed that you were using it and I would like to ask you some questions:  
Is this strategy making a profit?  
How long have you been using it?  
Advantages and disadvantages?  
Did you make any improvements?

Hi !  
  
The idea by itself to trade only on some specific signal and to have a time target for that trade ( hold trade only a precise period of time ) can be an edge for your trading. I traded succesfull last year for example only longs and only if a bulish bar is falowed by another bulish bar who also test the low of previous bar.   
  
I don t target 10pp per month ! I target only 2-3 profitable trades per month. Low frequency trading will improve considerable your trading psychology and also wiil give you an edge.  
  
I will not answer about the profitability of this or some other strategy. Instede I encourouge you to do backtest. This is the key to trust some strategy and begin to trade succcesfuly. I wiil give you an example of backtest.

Reduced the number of pair only to jpy pairs. Let s reload with this limitation the test on h4 time frame. Also the same pattern for d1 and w timeframe. This filter must improve dd caused by high corelation between markets.

Are you following the above 30 buys ema rules and vice versa?  
We need to work together to optimize the strategy

Yes, as you can see (kinda dark) my 30EMA is under the price, so only buying. Stoploss under the low of the engulfing candle and targeting 1:1 (200 of the FIB)

The RSI does not work. I see many here downloaded this EA. Did anyone find a setting to make the RSI work as was intended?

New improvments on this strategy:  
  
1\. Use only H8, D3 ( from ctrader platform) and higher (mt4 and tradingview)  
2\. wait for an inside bar formation ( check the chart 5-10 min before de close)  
3\. For inraday (H8) use only major USD pairs and major indices ( US, Dax, JP)  
4\. Trade only long version of the strategy  
5\. after inside bar check if the next candle is an outside bar  
a) outside bar body must be greater than inside bar body  
b) outside bar is also an outside bar for the mother of the inside bar  
6\. If a) & b) trace Fib from High of the outside bar to the low  
7\. Remove all Fib Level except 0 %, 50%, 100% and 80% (161)  
8\. Place a Buy Limit order at the 50% Level  
9\. Put your stop loss at the zero Level and your TP at the 161 Level  
10 . Set the life time of the order equal with length of the bar ( if H8 MT4 will delete your pending after 8 hours)  
  
I will be happy to see some aoutmatic backtest result to confirm that strategy is consistent ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

The major diference between the version of the strategy from the begining of the thread and tis version will be that we will sit confortable and fish for big trades and not go in water up to the neck and try to catch with hands-only. You can spot this pattern on stocks also for big time frame like 3M, 6M and 12M from tradingview. But for biger TF ( weekly and above) it is better to bet that the price will hit 161 first and will not hit 50% Level. Or a more consrvative aproach is assimetric rr with entry at the close and 161 as a target.

Hi Bat...  
  
OP gave up the system. And Buju who made EA and back test gave up. What about you? You did a lot of papertrading. It seemed to be non profital. Am I right? 

Read post #1 !! Then read it again 10 more times before you ask.

please can someone explain me why HZS engulfing v3 is used twice? was it for the purpose of showing that it can be used with different id or it is a part of the strategy?
