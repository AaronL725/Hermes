This one is dedicated to Dobbie, who told me I ought to make a guide describing my methods. While theoretically I could take this system and make money off of it, I'd rather see everyone benefit. If you should so decide to claim this method as your own, so be it, and I hope you can sleep soundly at night! I would like to have credit for this though.  
  
Just as a precursor, what this method COULD do for you after 6 months of backtesting:  
  

GBP/USD 1903 PIPS  
USD/CHF 1061 PIPS  
AUD/JPY 692 PIPS  
USD/JPY 891 PIPS

  
As of now, I have started forward testing this week and am currently up about 700 PIPS in one week, which has admittedly been just a lucky catch. If I were to use my method (which I am), I would stick to volatile pairs.. i.e. GBP/USD.  
  
  
So now that you know what this system COULD do, here is HOW it works:  
  
First, get out your handy dandy Daily Chart(GBP/USD)  
  
Then look for pivot points! Pretty easy, I know... But some of us may not know what pivot points look like, so let me describe them to you:  
  
A price will hit a minimum or a maximum.  
After that minimum or maximum, you must wait for the price to extend below the LOW (for maximums) and above the HIGH (for minimums). I usually use the spread.  
  
A real world example:  
GBP/USD  
On November 16th, 2006 it reaches a Minimum of 1.8831  
So, we observe the HIGH of that day, which happens to be 1.8966  
We then add the spread to this, which for [OANDA](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile"), the spread is typically 3.  
Our magic number is 1.8969!  
  
  
Now, the other part of my system...  
RSI  
  
Set an RSI(10) on your graph. I would draw 2 extra horizontal trendlines on your RSI at 40 and 60.  
  
Now there are several scenarios(rules) that will indicate whether to actually buy in our real world example:  
  
NOTE: If a BUY scenario is not reached within 3 days(3 BARS), then we do not act upon the pivot point. That is to say there are 3 bars between the MIN/MAX day and today.  
  
  

If our magic number 1.8969 is reached and the RSI(10) is sloping UP, ABOVE 50, then we BUY.  
  
If our magic number 1.8969 is reached and the RSI(10) is sloping UP,  
JUST came from 30, and now ABOVE 40, then we BUY.  
  
If our magic number 1.8969 is reached and the RSI(10) is sloping DOWN,  
ABOVE 50, we do NOTHING.  
  
Otherwise, If our magic number 1.8969 is reached and the RSI(10) is BELOW 50 we do NOTHING.

  
  
We then sell out when the next pivot point exists, EVEN if it is 2 bars later.. Again this means a MAXIMUM must develop and the next bar must not exceed it, and also go below the LOW of the MAXIMUM.   
  
NOTE: If a new maximum develops before the pivot point happens, we keep riding!  
  
ALSO, we set the stop loss to either the minimum that we bought near or 100 PIPS, whichever is less.  
  
Now I assume we are all intelligent and would be able to reverse everything for a sell position, but if you have any questions feel free to ask. The only major thing is using a value of 40 instead of 60 and 30 instead of 70 for the RSI(10) scenarios.  
  
As they say here in Texas, there's no such thing as a dumb question.  
  
Good luck to all ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Hi Kharvell,  
  
To what price is the RSI applied? Close, Open, High, Low, Median, etc.

I believe OANDA uses Close.

Alright, I had no photo editing software so I just used short lines... You should get the gist though...  
  
Basically red lines are min/max's and yellow lines are the magic numbers..  
  
Now when the magic numbers are hit that's when i check the RSI(Purple lines)  
  
As you can see the RSI isn't quite below 60 on the first trade COMING FROM 70 (see above scenario), so I wait until it is to confirm, then sell at the green line...  
  
I then buy at the next magic number to get rid of that trade...  
  
With a new magic number being crossed i check the RSI again (purple line) and it is not quite above 50, so i wait until it is, then buy at the green line, and sell at the next magic number...  
  
The process keeps repeating, but you don't always buy and sell... you must see what the scenario is.

Forex2stay has posed some very interesting and relevant questions that I feel could benefit everyone so I'm posting them here..

Say on the first day price hit's your magic number 1.8969 and surpasses it by 50 pips. RSI never confirms the trade. Later in the day price drops down and closes below the magic #. Let's say 1.8929. On the second day RSI confirms. Does price still only have to hit the magic number or does it have to exceed the previous days high?

Hmmm... good questions... If a new high develops, and the next bar goes below the LOW of that high bar, then you now have a new pivot point! You are looking to sell, so you must check the RSI. But if it does not go below the LOW, then you still use the first MINIMUM as your pivot... Like I said this is good for 3 days. Whatever the magic number is on that minimum is when you buy...  
  
Also, I would consider the RSI observations about 70% reality and 30% intuition.. If you have strong reason to believe a condition will be met i.e. thick green bar, and the RSI is sloping up at 50, you're probably going to want to buy it. But generally I will not wait til close to buy because the RSI will usually cross the 50 before the close

Interesting system. I have been working on a daily trading system similar. I will test and post anything I feel may help.

Kharvell, would you mind elaborating a bit on the set up, ie how to determine when we have a minimum and maximum at hand and what they will be. Your example, for instance, refers to 16 November's high and low, but it looks to me like this was the high and low for 15 November, not 16 November. Is it basically a breakout of any random day's high and low on a following day where RSI confirms?  
  
Thank you.

Thanks kharvell for posting this system. The back testing and forward testing results are very impressive, therefore merit due attention.  
  
I have not been abe to understand it completly, and have following questions,  
  
1\. You refer to the Pivot points- are these the normal pivot points(Resistance R1, R2, R3, cntrl pivot, Support S1, S2, S3) or any thing different.  
  
2.The maximum of B. Pound for 16th Nov is 1.8966. For going long, you add 3pip spread to make 1.8969. You call this a magic number. Is this the only reason to make it a magic number?  
  
3\. 1.8969 is the max. for 16th November. Then we should look for this value within next three days. If this value is not reached, then just forget it and do not look this value anymore. However if this value is reached within next 3 days then look to go long/short depending on RSI(10).   
  
A. RSI(10) sloping up and more than 50----BUY  
B. RSI(10) sloping up and come from 30 to 40----BUY   
This mean that if RSI(10) is sloping up, this is BUY.  
  
C. RSI(10) sloping down and above 50---Do nothing  
D. If RSI(10) is below 50 ----Do nothing  
This means that if RSI(10) is sloping down, no action.  
  
4\. Similarly for short, one should be looking for the minimum value of 1.8631 to be reached within next three days, and go short if RSI(10) is sloping downward.  
  
5\. Would request some information on Take profit and stop loss.

WOW, you guys are really pumping out the tough questions! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1) Alright, I'm not sure if I'm allowed to post this due to copyrights, but it is only one page, and it explains Pivot Points...  
  
Essentially, A series of Highs continue to get higher, but then on one day the high DOESN'T GO HIGHER! THAT is a MAXIMUM! The reverse is true for a minimum! The link below indicates IDEAL pivot points. If you think of the market as waves, your pivots are at the VERY TOP and VERY BOTTOM of each wave!  
  
Look at JohnDoe's post below to see the pivot article!

First of all, you are really doing your homework ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1) ! I assure you with time, pivot points will jump out at you like they are an eye sore..  
  
Let me answer your questions now:  
  
1\. Pivot Points have NOTHING to do with resistance or supports as you may know them. I know exactly what you are talking about with all that mumbo jumbo support resistance stuff, but seriously it's a matter of looking at candle sticks that are showing increasing high's and decreasing lows, and seeing where that trend stops.  
  
2\. I simply call it "the magic number" because it is the only # you need to know.  
  
3\. For November 16th, you would only look to go LONG because you came from a MINIMUM pivot, you would only look to go SHORT had a MAXIMUM pivot developed.  
  
4\. You have got the gist of it, but it is possible for the RSI to be sloping UP above 40(but below 50) but it DID NOT come from 30. THIS is very IMPORTANT! If it didn't come from 30 then you do not buy!  
  
5\. Take profit? I do not believe in that! I don't know if you have read any of the Market Wizards books, but almost EVERY trader will tell you to cut losses, and LET PROFITS RIDE! This being said, we wait for the next magic number in a reversal to get out of the trade. And as far as stop losses go, it will initially be 100 PIPS or the minimum(or maximum), whichever is lower..   
  
Suppose if you will that a trade is going in your favor UP and each bar's high increases from the previous. As each bar is completed, you set your stop loss to the LOW of the completed bar before it. This essentially is claiming temporarily that the bar before it will be a pivot point, when in fact it is not. If you need examples, please look where my stop losses are set in the trades I have posted above!  
  
  
  
Hope this all helps, if you still need clarification let me know! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

I've got it all figured out ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)   
  
So here is the recent GBP/USD trade I've made, The down arrow is when I entered, and the RED LINE is my current S/L! Notice how it is set at the high of the completed bar:

In this trade you are short correct?  
so should'nt the stop be above the arrow?  
and that red line be a TP?  
do you follow the trade with a trailing stop? I know you have to do this manually at [Oanda](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile"), that is where I trade too. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60e.png?v=15.1)  
  
OK My mistake......you are following the price down and you have locked in at the second down bar... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f644.png?v=15.1)

Yes I am short..and I don't know if you are aware but i am STILL IN this position  
Yes initially this is the case, BUT the trade is going in my favor, so I keep moving the stop to lock in profits.. This paragraph above should explain it..

DON'T MENTION TP'S AROUND ME ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f621.png?v=15.1)   
  
![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1) I'm only kidding, but seriously, the very hinge of my system is that you maximize profits... Otherwise losing trades would more than likely get you in negative territory

That is correct! I am essentially guaranteeing myself 200 PIPS should this 340 PIP position turn on me!

When you have a minute i have a few more questions for you.

  1. Is there a limit of profit that has to be reached before you start using the opposite extreme as the SL? For example, in your example above how soon did you start using the high of the last candle as your trailing stop?
  2. You mentioned in one of your other posts that you do not wait until the candle closes before you enter. In your backtesting or forward testing have you ever seen price hit the magic number, RSI confirm, and then price retraces below the magic number, and RSI drops, which no longer causes it to confirm? The reason I ask is because for everyone trying to backtest we are only seeing what it looks like close of day. We can not see what happend to RSI during the day.

I hope these questions make sense.  
  
Trade Well...

Hi fellow traders,  
  
I am new to this forum, been demo trading for about a year with mixed results. This appears to be a system that trades the bounce off of a daily high/low channel with the RSI as confirmation. Trigger is the low of the high pivot or high of the low pivot. From what I have read, channel trading has always been very good performers. In fact Larry William's first publicly offered tradings systems(back in the early 80's) were channel systems for which he offered maony back gaurentees if they did not make a profit for the buyer!!

There is no limit as to when you start moving your stop! As each completed bar develops, you treat it as if it COULD be the new pivot point. Let me show you an example below of my current trade in USD/JPY:  
  
  
I am using this is as an example of a ranging trade, This also qualifies as your question #2 answer, because if you look at the RSI, it is doing all sorts of funny business. This may not have been my best trade, but I'm waiting to see what becomes of it. As of now I'm up 6 PIPS, but towards the close of the day I should have a better idea of whether or not it is a loser

Channel systems are great! Really look at the Vegas method in this forum, because as far as channel systems go, it is one of the best! As far as my system goes, it is relatively new and still in the 2nd week of forward testing, more than likely needing improvements. I have given you the backtesting results, and it is really up to you to decide what systems will suit you best! Good luck to you, my friend!

I have redone the backtest of GBP/USD. Apparently, earlier I thought 6 months was starting in August, but it is in fact July ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1): silly me. I find the results very INTERESTING, and am amazed at how well the system seems to work.  
  
Also, I think I am adding a new rule to wait till the end of the day for decisions, this make the RSI more accurate when set on close. If you have the option consider experimenting with OPEN RSI VS CLOSE, and please let us know which works better  
  
Here are the results:

Any chance you can put up a chart or two and walk us through the first 4 trades? I think it would be a nice learning experience for everyone.

This could be a bit of a stupid question but.........what day or days do u start this system on or is it a case of it works on any day ? Just the first example u gave was a thursday so do u use them pivots for the next 3 days or change them according to action the following day ?

No stupid questions here.. I'm not sure I get what you're asking though.. I would tell you that a pivot could happen on any day, monday through friday. You just have to look at the preceding days(whether their high's are trending up, lows are trending down) then the next bar will stop the trend of increasing high's or decreasing lows... I hope this makes sense, but let me know if it doesn't.

Alright forex2stay, you and you're great questions... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)   
  
Here is a chart for you and anyone else interested.. It works much like the other one I've posted, but only includes the first 2 trades in my backtest.. Basically,  
Every red line is a pivot point, every yellow line is a magic number, every purple line is me checking the RSI when the magic # is hit, and the 2 cyan(light blue, VERY HARD TO SEE, look at the yellow lines) are when I would have bought. Then, if you follow after the cyan line, the next magic #(yellow line) is when I would have sold.  
  
If you need some more examples, do let me know

Yes i get what your saying the system works on any day, therefore everyday you'd have to look at the charts to see the pivot point for that days entries am i right ? And do u wait till the close of the daily bar to decide your entry, which would be GMT or what ? Thanks for your answers.  
  
Just one more question, would it be possible for u to post your entries for a day or so so we could get a clearer idea of where to entries would be ?

Yes you are right, essentially, one could check their pivots only once per day towards the end of the day(not sure the exact GMT, if someone knows, LET US KNOW![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)) and my system would work. I like to keep an eye on my trades though just to be sure..  
  
I have just added the rule that it would be best to make trades and S/L decisions towards the end of the day... Hopefully, someone is ambitious and will experiment with an open RSI for me, as I can only use [OANDA](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile") on my mac

These trades are still going from last week. I have yet to see another opportunity to get rid of them and/or reverse positions:

Yes, they are using the end of the day RSI, and I'm not quite sure what you mean by inside and outside bars, so please clarify and I believe I should be able to come up with an answer ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f615.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/2753.png?v=15.1) ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Thank you,  
An inside bar is one where both the Hi and Lo are within the previous bar Hi and Lo. An outside bar is where the Hi is above previous bar Hi and the Lo is below previous bar Lo.

Ahhh I got ya! An outside bar will be irrelevant unless it creates a new high or low, and so will inside bars. Inside bars, as long as they stay within your pivot points, are meaningless. It's all relative to the last pivot point, and if a new pivot point emerges because of outside bars, then that's the only time to take note of them.

Good question regarding inside bars.. i would tend not to include inside bars (daily bars which do not exceed hi or low of previous day) so leave trailing stop at the previous bar.   
  
Outside or engulfing bars will be a signal that a new pivot is forming and get ready to make a move.   
  
There is a case where a narrow range inside bar (maybe doji) doesn't go as low as two engulfing opposite direction bars on either side. or if this inside bar is ignored this is the same as a double hi or low which could turn into a pivot. (merge the double bars together and you see the pivot)..   
  
Another take off on this that i've been using sometimes is to use an equivalent 1 day stop on shorter term charts, so say use the hi/low of the last 6 bars as your trailing stop when trading 4 hr chart.

I would say so, it was a long time ago when I tested it without, but the system is more prone to false breakouts without it! So I would stick to the RSI, or if you can find a better one, let me know!

Thanks _**kharvell**_ \- have enjoyed your thread and learned from you! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f647-200d-2642-fe0f.png?v=15.1)   
  
I believe that in terms of the 'close', many use 10:00 pm GMT which is the same as 5:00 pm EST.  
  
Question please: regarding your post #27 - is my understanding correct that you would not have traded that pair with this system from 12/20 thru 1/2 - [assuming 12/20 was a max high, which it may not have actually been]??

Good answer there! You pretty much have it right on the spot.. As far as 4 hr charts, I have tried back testing, but they do not appear as profitable. Again, this is because of false breakouts in ranging markets! BUT if you do some backtesting and you do find it a bit more profitable, DO let us know!  
  
Again, I realize this system is not perfect, and I WANT improvements, so please keep on with the feedback ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Hey, thanks for the answer!! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1) And it makes me happy to see that you've got it RIGHT ON the spot!! I would NOT have traded if that were the high ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

FYI, Many currency pairs are now showing reversal days i believe or may very likely by tomorrow! I'm long EUR and carry JPY crosses. GBP a possible buy around 9340 if it confirms pivot low and bounces 38fib is my guess.

Could you elaborate more on where you are getting these numbers? I assume that you are not using my system, as I am looking to buy gbp/usd at around 1.945 or so..

If i have this right, we wait for the close of the current bar to determine if the previous bar contains the max or min? And if so (pretend it's the max) the low of that previous bar becomes the magic number? If that is so, what do you do if the current bar close is way below the magic number?

Sounds about right. i did make my trades based on another system. It looks like GBP/USD RSI did not come up from 30 although now above 40, sloping up but flattening so i wouldn't be suprised to see a slight pull back (which is where i like to buy), then another shot up that will push the RSI over 50 triggering your system long and moving further up .. but until then stick with your system.

It does not necessarily have to be when the bar closes:  
Pretend a max develops and the next bar is red, and you don't think it will go above the newly formed max. At this point you could sell if you have reason to believe your max won't be challenged. And if it is past your magic # and RSI is still indicating, then all is well for a sell ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

That's what I thought! Good luck this week with your trades ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)   
  
  
  
Also, my short position was closed in GBP/USD for 200 PIPS profit.  
  
So for those of you following I sold at 1.9636 and was stopped out at 1.9436

Thanks for your answers! I have one more question. Does the 100 or previous Hi/Lo (whichever is less rule) for stops apply to each closing bar during an ongoing trade? Or just at the beginning of a trade?  
I lied, i have just one more. If you are quite a ways from the magic number in the right direction before the RSI confirms, do you enter with the RSI?

Hi kharvell  
Thanks for sharing your system. I'm very keen on learning a daily system  
cos smaller time frames often drive me crazy esp with Cable.  
  
One question, please.  
Wasn't yesterday's (7 Jan) bar the new pivot with Low @ 1.9262 and  
High @1.9405 ?  
  
If so, isn't then the magic no for a buy @ 1.9408, and that RSI  
is turning up from 30 plus to above 40? So, should be be Long  
at 1.9408?? Also, RSI didn't go to a low of 30, only 33. Does  
this still satisfy the conditions?  
  
Appreciate your advice. Thanks

Thanks Kharvell for sharing your system with the FF community. It is a nice daily system.   
I have put up a chart showing the RSI on open and close for reference. I am not yet sure about any significance....but it is interesting to see anyway. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)   
  
FJFX......as you see I have similar prices to you but not exactly the same figures. We will all have different prices as we all use different platforms and data feed

If our magic number 1.8969 is reached and the RSI(10) is sloping UP, ABOVE 50, then we BUY.  
  
  
If our magic number 1.8969 is reached and the RSI(10) is sloping UP,  
JUST came from 30, and now ABOVE 40, then we BUY.  
  
If our magic number 1.8969 is reached and the RSI(10) is sloping DOWN,  
ABOVE 50, we do NOTHING.  
  
Otherwise, If our magic number 1.8969 is reached and the RSI(10) is BELOW 50 we do NOTHING.  
  
  
  
Hi Kharvell,  
  
Thanks for sharing your system. Very Helpful. I want to make sure how you trade with RSI(10). Let's look at today's USDJPY.   
According my InterbankFx deta, the magic number should be 119.04 (Mimimum/Maximum of Jan 05). My question is the RSI(10) already over 60, would you enter the long position if today's bar reach the magic number? Do you limit the long/short entry if RSI(10) higher/lower certain level?   
  
Thanks a lot.

The 100 Pip or Min/Max rule should only apply during the beginning of the trade.. After that, you must use the "Magic number" assuming each bar there after will be a pivot... I hope this makes sense, but please let me know if id does not.  
  
If you are quite aways from the Magic #, chances are your 3 days have expired or you're just trying to shoot fish in a barrel... My point is that if the RSI indicates within 3 days of a passing pivot point and GOOD RSI indicator, then do what you need to do... Otherwise, historically speaking, it is not worth the risk to make the trade..

Not too sure what your question is here, but my response will be that you can have 3 BARS between the PIVOT and today, otherwise, chances are it will be not worth it!  
  
And, if you look at the back tests of other currencies(look at first post), it turns out that this method IS effective, but it seems so far that it is MOST effective in volatile pairs!

IF I were to trade strictly upon your chart, I would buy when you did, but as you can see a max develops, thus creating a new pivot point in 1 bar! so I would sell at the LOW of that max which looks to be at around 1.8860 or so!

fjfx,  
  
I'm supposing that we have different brokers, but essentially, you have the fundamentals of my system to a T! The recent minimum I have for GBP/USD is 1.9248 and the magic # is around 1.945. However, the RSI for one DID NOT go to 30, so it DOES NOT qualify, we will see in the future whether or not we missed out or not! If it is to go above 50 within the next couple of days, then we will buy! I will post when and IF I enter a long trade!  
  
Hope this helps! Good luck

Antra,  
  
Thanks for your chart there! I would say that if the RSI there is coming from 30, then you will most likely have a BUY coming up as soon as the price hits the HIGH of your pivot! I understand that different brokers have different prices, and I look forward to your results with YOUR broker ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

With time, this could POTENTIALLY be a good BUY, however as of now, I do not feel as though this is a good trade! I would wait til the RSI is ABOVE 50 FOR SURE and according to YOUR graph, you can see that the RSI is moving very flatly(mainly due to a NEW bar opening) but chances are, at least on a short term level, that you will profit! It is when the RSI will match that will tell you whether or not you are in a profitable LONG TERM trade!  
  
Hope this helps!

szbear,  
  
I am happy to help! Good analysis on the USD/JPY! I actually have just BOUGHT at 119.07! The RSI is looking mighty FANTASTIC, so this is an ideal trade! As USD/JPY is ranging as of late, it might not get the 300 PIP profit we shoot for, but it is certainly worth the shot! And as your last question asks, there is no limit to the RSI more than the scenarios I have posted. If you can think of a more profitable scenario, DO let me know, but as of now, that is it! Just look at those scenarios, and those are the ONLY limits!  
  
Good luck!

I hope I have this right, to determine a max high or low a bar closes and the previous bar is lets say is lower than todays bar, then todays bar closes and the next bar also is lower, so our day 2 bar would be a high point? Then we would use the low end of the day 2 bar as our target number to sell plus the spread? So should we be looking at 3 bars to determine our projections?  
Thanks.

For sell you do not need to add the spread, it is for buy only as the charts mostly plot the bid price.

Hey kharvell,  
  
Thanks for sharing your system. I must have the same broker as fjfx, because I'm in on the same signal. The magic number was hit right after the close of yesterday's bar. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

>  I'm supposing that we have different brokers, but essentially, you have the fundamentals of my system to a T! The recent minimum I have for GBP/USD is 1.9248 and the magic # is around 1.945. However, the RSI for one DID NOT go to 30, so it DOES NOT qualify, we will see in the future whether or not we missed out or not! If it is to go above 50 within the next couple of days, then we will buy! I will post when and IF I enter a long trade!

Very clever Antra - how did you get the two RSI's into the same chart window (I'm assuming that's MT4 I'm looking at)?![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f615.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/2753.png?v=15.1)

1-Identify a pivot high bar on daily chart, that is a bar which has a bar on each side with lower highs  
  
2-Short set-up is break of the low of the pivot high bar, if:  
a) RSI 10 is hooking down from 70 level and crossed 60 level OR  
b) if RSI has not reached 70 level, it has crossed 50 level  
  
Initial stop is above the high of the pivot bar or 100 pips whichever is less.  
Stepped stops are above the high of previous day's bar when a daily bar closes.  
  
There is no set target, exit on stop-out.  
  
The reverse applies to long entries with the exception that spread should be added to the trigger level which is top of the pivot low bar.  
  
The method has nothing to do with calculated daily pivot lines.  
  
I hope this clarifies.

Has anyone noted the gbp/usd pivot point from 1/8, the number would be 1.9391, however since the rsi is flat is anyone going to go long on this.

I'm long on the 01/08 pivot @1.9413 (price exeeded the magic number after the closing bar yesterday rather quickly and I jumped- but this is **demo**). RSI was above 30 and and approaching 40 at the time I entered.  
  
S/L @ 1.9313.  
  
This position was in profit by more than 40 pips at one point since entering, but as I said- it's a demo and I'm testing the system. We shall see...

Dave,   
I am currently driving from Indiana to Texas, and was up late last night at a going away party. This being said, I'm not sure if I'm just really tired and out of it, or this question is very wordy! If you could please find a visual example of your question, I think this would make it easier for the both of us ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1): My apologies

First and foremost, thank YOU for thanking ME! Secondly, I'm happy to see that you have spotted the pivot, and you are checking the signal to make sure it qualifies. I still haven't gotten a BUY yet for cable, but that's not to say you didn't make the right trade! It looks as though it might range for a little bit, but we'll see what happens I guess! Good luck to you

Oh wow, I didn't even notice the 2 RSI's  
  
Antra do you have any thoughts on which RSI appears to be better looking at history?

I would like to apologize first! I am quick to learn things, but HORRIBLE at teaching.. So I'm sorry that my first post isn't the best. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1):   
  
And howard, I would like to thank you for your very simple display of my system. This would be a perfect "cheat sheet" to print out for people just starting. Thanks for taking your time to do that! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)   
  
Alright, I think I've got most of the posts out of the way there  
  
Now, the good stuff ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)   
  
I have just entered a few trades and stopped out on some old ones I had..  
I would like to show you the process for clarification:  
  
First of all,   
Here are my completed trades so far with forward testing:  
  
SHORT GBP/USD @ 1.9636 Stopped out 1.9436 = 200PIPS  
SHORT USD/JPY @ 118.64 Stopped out 119.07 = -43 PIPS  
SHORT AUD/JPY @ 94.31 Stopped out 93.13 = 118 PIPS  
  
And I still have my USD/CHF trade  
  
Here are the current trades I have, I will post some graphs to walk you through in a little bit:

Alright then  
Same drill as always, but these are actual trades not hypothetical:  
Red Lines: Max/Min  
Yellow Lines: Magic #  
Purple Lines: Me checking the RSI  
  
Down arrows: Sell positions start  
Up arrows: Buy positions start  
Red Circles: Stop loss hit  
  
  
Unfortunately, My graphs are littered with dots and arrows from when I used to trade on short term, so I can only offer you this AUD/JPY graph.  
  
Hope it helps,  
  
Kevin

It has just occurred to me why, you are in this trade and I am not! The answer is that I do not include Sundays in my data, and I believe that is where your low pivot has happened.. Let me know if I am right on this!

No, my daily chart from InterbankFX has the Friday, January 5th low of 1.9264, the next (regular) daily bar I used was Monday, January 8th's, which had a low of 1.9262- **only _2 pips_ lower**\- but still technically a low-pivot bar, no?  
  
My guess is that you're not in the trade because your broker's data was just slightly different.  
  
I know two pips on a daily is like a freckle on an elephant's butt- but I _really_ wanted to test this thing out. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Hi Kevin  
  
Thanks for your example on AUD/JPY. I think I fully understand your  
entry triggers, but could you kindly clarifiy your stepped stop loss.  
  
In your example, you  
  
Short Aug/JPY on 4 Jan; so initial stop loss is High of 3 Jan  
  
Then, as soon as 4 Jan candle closes, you move stop to High of 4 Jan.  
  
Again, as soon as 5 Jan candle closes, you move stop to High of 5 Jan  
  
Am I correct so far??  
  
Then, on 8th Jan, shouldn't you be stopped out at the High of 5 Jan??  
(as compared to your "red circle on 8 Jan)  
  
  
  
Next, how about the Long trigger?  
  
You now use the High of 8 Jan + spread as the magix no trigger?  
So, you entered long on 9 Jan? Correct?  
  
Apologies in advance, but I'm trying to follow your thought process.  
  
Thanks

Very good questions fjfx,  
Although JAN 5th could have been my stoploss and it would have been better, according to my system, Jan 7th had a lower low. This indicates that IT has to be the next pivot point; therefore i was looking to sell at IT'S high.. As you know, markets go either up or down, and I was hoping for down, but up came instead, so my new pivot stopped me out... Hope that makes sense  
  
And as far as my long trade, that's exactly what I did.. I think it actually happened at 22:13 on Jan 8th, but that's because I have been driving all day, and didn't want to miss the opportunity, so just placed the order last night. (Close enough ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) )

Hi kharvell, me again.  
  
Could you explain how you came up with an entry for short on cable at 1.9334? I'm missing it. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f615.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/2753.png?v=15.1)

I was under the impression that the rule was to trade at the end of a pivot bar? I can see that yesterday's bar was a pivot, but the current bar? How can it be determined a pivot so early in the day?

Well Ken,  
  
We've found that we all get different #'s with different brokers.. I use [OANDA](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile"), and they are telling me that January 9th produced a high of 1.9456, so I'm using the low of 1.9342 plus some as a # to get in.. Here's a picture for you:  
  
I remember you saying you're long correct?

Ahhh you make a good point.. I guess you could say that I'm betting that an outside bar won't occur. By this I mean, that if it makes a lower low, then it more than likely won't make a higher high..  
  
Adding a bit more risk... Typically, I will check throughout the day, but as I will be driving all day tomorrow, it's not going to happen

Yep, long. Forgive me but it seems like determining the entry is kind of discretionary. A "recent low" could be any low, couldn't it?

Well, seeing how my long is a paper trade, and your short is likely a live trade, here's to hoping the bar stays red (short).

Not clever really just picked it up from another thread.  
Yes tis MT4 on alpari data  
  
Firstly place an RSI indicator on the chart and set it to Period 10 and on 'close'.  
Then from the 'Navigator' drag and drop another RSI on top of the first RSI and set this one to period 10 as well and colour it something different to the first one AND in the APPLY to window select the option that says 'First Indicators Data' and there you have it.  
  
Now as far as trying to see if it makes a difference ...I am testing this still but it seems that a cross of the two RSI's might give us some clues. Nothing conclusive as yet though but if something does work better then I will let you know.  
  
Fractals on the chart also give a nice aid when looking back on data.  
  
And...there is a great post over on the MT4 thread written by Hanover and it is tips and hints on MT4. As I have been using this platform for a couple of years I thought I knew it all ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1): but I picked up a lot of handy stuff...

RSI did not hook up from 30 level, therefore you should have waited until it crossed 50 to trigger a buy as opposed to 40 level, which did not.

ok, here is the stupid question for this thread!!  
  
what is RSI?? sorry, i am still learning all the language here.  
  
the software i have does not use "candles", it uses buying and selling pressure graphs, so i see volume and it takes every trade,buy and sell, and shows direction of price. i am sure i could graph this myself as homework to set my pivot points, but rsi is baffling me.   
  
fyi, i think the end of the day is 1630 est, but that is when my software resets.  
  
thanks

RSI stands for Relative Strength Index. When it goes up it means, buyers have more strength and when it goes down, it means sellers have more strength. While this is good to know, for the purposes of my system you just need to look at the #'s and the slope. The values of RSI will range from 0 to 100.  
  
And I've never heard of a charting package without candles; maybe look around to see what you can find?  
  
Good luck to you

This is true...RSI was actually hooking up from 33- everything about this trade was forcing the outter limits of the rules. It should've been a no-trade.

I set up a bunch of entry orders on yesterdays pivot points before going to bed I woke up to find I'm in 7 different pairs. They were all in the negative for a while but now positive a total of 20 pips.  
What I find incredibley interesting is that they all hovered around thier own previous day high or low at exactly the same time. Now they are slowly moving into profit together. I know the whole market moves together but this is facinating to watch.   
Theoretically one could just go big in one or two pair and profit just the same as a little in 10 different pairs. At least it looks that way.

I'm still confused (a little) - in the original docs the author states "close trade when a new pivot forms" (I'm assuming this means in the opposite direction as the previous pivot) but Howard, in his clarification post says "there are no exits, wait for trade to stop out". Am I still missing something obvious? Should a trade be closed when a pivot forms in the opposite direction or should trades be exited only by being allowed to hit the stop? Any help is much appreciated.

Lou  
  
Both phrases are the same, when a pivot in the other direction is formed you have already moved your stop to the other end of that pivot bar and you would exit when it is hit.  
  
The exception is when the bar forming after the pivot is an inside bar which does not stop you out, in that case you may wait for another day when either it gets you stopped or continues in the direction of your trade.

FiboFan,  
  
I'm curious, are you using the RSI to indicate as well or just the pivot points?  
And you're right, about using a lot of pairs( I don't know about 10![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)), but I find it better because you have more chances to guess right.  
  
Good luck to you

Billy,  
  
I have only tried 1 hour and 3 hour in backtesting, it seems to be more prone to false breakouts on these smaller time frames(thus, more losses). Also, the PIP gains are not nearly as huge per trade.

Yes was thinking it might be more prone to breakouts. When did u enter your cable trade just wondering how or where did u get the pivot of 1.9334 ? A small chart would probably explain things a lot easier, if u could !

Hi Howard and Kharvell  
  
Need some clarifications, please.  
  
Inside Days :  
For inside days, do you leave the pivot points ( & magic numbers) at the  
previous day's H/L? Meaning the the highs & Lows of the Inside day is  
ignored"?  
  
  
Outside Days :  
For outside days, since the High of the current day is Higher than the previous high and the Low of the current day is lower than the previous low, does it mean the trade will be naturally stopped out and reversed?  
  
Is this how you would trade outside days?  
Or, would you just let it be stopped out. Then use the H/L of the outside  
days as the new entry trigger??  
  
Would appreciate any help! Thanks

Is there anyone out there who could code an MT4 indicator for this system which highlights when there is a buy or sell situation? It shouldn't be too difficult for someone who knows what they are doing (not me!) - just look for the pivot point, check the RSI and highlight the buy/sell & stop loss points ?  
  
I think it would simplify things for those struggling with the system, or for those using it over multiple currency pairs.  
  
Thanks!  
  
Jason.

I'm writing an indicator but doing it in stages - would someone who really understands this method take a look at the attached chart? The red/green arrows are intended to identify the pivots. The indicator is waiting until the bar AFTER the potential high/low is completely closed before calling it an authentic pivot, which I think is correct.  
  
If this looks okay to those who know, I will continue to work on the other aspects of the indicator. Ignore the buy/sell lines on the chart - they are related to another method I am testing.

Lou  
  
Some of the fractals on the bars have been formed as a result of Sunday bars, in my opinion these should be ignored.  
  
As you may be aware this method, apart from profit targets, is very similar to fozzy daily for which an indicator was coded and in the thread it was agreed that we have to use charts without weekend bars for the indicator to be efficient.  
  
Other than this point, the fractals are in fact showing high and low pivots on your chart.

My broker of choice is Interbank and I'm not sure that ignoring weekend bars is optional with them as it is with [Oanda](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile"). I will probably have to code around this. Thanks for your input.

How is everybody doing with this strategy?  
lets see if we can keep this going and maybe fine tune it a little bit more, though don't really think it needs it.  
  
here is the system with only 3 indicators, they support each other for confirmation....

Hey everyone,  
  
Thanks for your good wishes, I should be back for the moment. Unfortunately I won't be able to provide you with "excellent visuals" ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1) , but I'll try and keep you updated on what I'm doing!  
  
Also,  
John,  
  
I like what you are doing by putting the 30 minute up and shrinking it using stochastics. However, my intentions with my system was to KISS (keep it simple, stupid). I'm also questioning whether you have the correct RSI value if you wanted to convert it to 10 on a daily. When you get a chance, explain your thought process on why you think this is an improvement!  
  
Thanks,  
  
Kevin  
  
Some of you may be curious as to what trades I have open:  
  
USD/CHF LONG @ 1.2156 = 311 PIPS S/L 1.2441  
USD/JPY LONG @ 119.07 = 121 PIPS S/L 120.13  
AUD/JPY LONG @ 93.47 = 75 PIPS S/L 93.75  
  
Thinking about entering GBP/USD LONG if tomorrow ends up being a good day.  
  
Good luck,  
  
Kevin

Good to see you back kharvell......  
  
I'm not using stochs' the indicators are .... SMA 25.....PSAR 0.002, 0.02, and a 21 RSI.... I use this on my daily trading and entry signals, This system just lets me scalp a few extra pips while the longer trade is running.  
the adjustments of the indicators just make them react a little quicker. Also I find there is really no need to use 2 MAs since I am looking for the price to cross the MA with the RSI confirming the new direction.....![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)   
The PSAR also helps with the determination of entry ..... it is best used with the trend since it will lead to false signals in a ranging market, also longer time frames.

the conditions for a long in cable has been met, so i dont understand why you will want to wait and see what tomorrow brings before you enter the trade. are there any other factors we need to be looking out for or should we apply some discretion to the signals?

Sundays can be kind of decieving since the market is a bit thin, at least for me, can't answer for kharvell though.

i know we ignore the weekend data, but if at the end of friday, we have a long signal like we have on cable, shouldn't we enter and go long as soon as monday starts, ignoring what happens on sunday?

I think it's better to wait until the daily downtrendline is broken, but I'm long since friday and +170 pips...

John,  
  
STOCHASTICS! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f644.png?v=15.1) I don't know what I'm talking about half the time ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1).. And it sounds good for short term.. My next step is to try and create a system that is effective for short term, but we'll have to see how that goes. I'm glad you have found something that works for you.  
  
Good luck,  
  
Kevin

Yes, if I am looking to enter, and today is just getting a beating, I don't think I would enter on a red bar day. Like I said, a red bar would indicate negative slope in RSI, and that would not be a condition to enter. So, that's really what I'm looking for today. BTW I did enter![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) ANd I agree with John, I am usually cautious after weekends.

Well, I should've entered on Friday, but I missed the opportunity, so I just took it yesterday. While it has still been 3 days, I was thinking it might still go up *fingers crossed*

Hello kharvell  
  
Thanks a lot for sharing your system. I've been looking for a KISS system for daily charts, so imagine my enthusiasm for your ideas.  
  
I do, unfortunately, have the dumbest question ever:  
  
You're putting in _stop orders_ to stop you in at the magic numbers, right? And you're doing so in _anticipation_ of an RSI permission, yes?  
  
If not, I can't see how this can be a daily system, nor how you got into your latest USD/CHF trade at 1.2256.  
  
Thanks in advance & best of luck with your family situation,  
  
DSL

Hi DSL![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
If you're looking for KISS, you've found a VERY good system! And your question is hardly the DUMBEST question ever! You actually caught me! That USD/CHF trade was made at the early stages of my forward testing, where I hadn't decided to wait til the end of each day to make trades. While I am not very good at following this new rule, I believe it would increase success rates. Unfortunately, like most traders, I want to be in it to win it as soon as it starts changing![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f644.png?v=15.1) ! Not sure if this is good or bad as of yet, but for now I would say for YOU to wait til the end of the day, until you start to recognize pivots like they are the easiest thing in the world. You will also begin to realize how the RSI is affected by them. Just give it some time!  
  
Good luck to you,  
Kevin  
  
ALSO, SOME TRADES HAVE VANISHED![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f633.png?v=15.1) (this smily cracks me up)!  
  
Long USD/CHF @ 1.2156 S/L 1.2441 STOPPED OUT = 285 PIPS  
Long AUD/JPY @ 93.47 S/L 94.16 STOPPED OUT = 69 PIPS  
  
Trades Holding:  
  
LONG GBP/USD @ 1.9643 S/L 1.9599 = 24 PIPS  
(and for those of you wondering about my late entry, for the record, I did take a smaller position size on this one(2000 vs 5000)  
  
LONG USD/JPY @ 120.68 S/L 119.68 = -15 PIPS  
  
  
  
AND LASTLY,  
I have some rather conclusive and (impressive?) FORWARD TESTING RESULTS:  
  
While I cannot offer you a net(pippage), I can tell you that my account has increased by 8.7% since January 4th! Not bad for a few trades here and there!  
  
Well, good luck to all and to all a good day!

Hey Kevin,  
  
I am excited about the potential of this system. I appreciate your time and effort in passing this information on to us.  
  
Has anyone taken a long trade on EUR/JPY? Did this meet the criteria from last week?  
  
Thanks again.

Hey Piece Of The Pie,  
  
Thanks for your words of encouragement. I am looking at EUR/JPY and it appears I would have taken a long trade on January 11th at around 155.4~. I'm curious as to when you entered, and how you are doing! Let me know.  
  
Kevin

Hey Kevin,  
  
I got in yesterday @155.798 after finding your thread on Sunday.  
  
I am up 24 pips right now. Was up over 50 this morning. Lots of whipsaw going on.  
  
Looking at the RSI, I still think I am going to be ok for a while.  
  
Keep up the good work.

Is there a short signal forming for GBP/USD? A new high is set today, compared to the last three candles... and the RSI is pointing down, haven't crossed below 50 yet...

YES, good observation. I would put a lot of marbles in this one because it is "ideal".  
  
  
  
Some food for thought:  
  
Last night, I was lying in bed, thinking about forex(lame, I know) and I believe I had an epiphany.  
  
What if you're in a really good trade, shouldn't you PUT MORE IN?!  
  
And alas, I have found a solution today.  
  
Suppose if you will:  
  
You are in long position(TREND UP) the RSI just keeps sloping up, but then on one day the RSI's slope INCREASES MORE.  
  
I think I will buy more the next time I see this.

Very nice system, I can't wait to start trading it. I think few more things still need to clarify, and I will able to say that I finally understand it completely.  
  
For now I have a question if you don't mind...  
  
Generally:  
When a "pivot candle" is formed, are we looking at the current price and potential opportunity to go either LONG or SHORT, or just one of those positions? In another words, does previous candle has 2 "magic numbers", or just one?  
  
More precisely and with actual example:  
Let's say I started watching the market TODAY (Jan 16th), and am looking for opportunity to trade your system, i.e. entry condition. I am looking at daily GBPUSD @ [OANDA](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile"). Today's candle is of course still forming, so I go step by step back. Yesterday's candle looks like the good one to use as orientation. It has min/max of 1.9591/1.9669. Given the spread, our "lower and upper magic numbers" would be 1.9588/1.9672. So:   
  
are we supposed to enter Long if the current price crosses 1.9672, and enter Short if it goes below 1.9588 (assuming that RSI10 conditions are satisfied)?  
[ _I mean just first of these 2 conditions that happen, not both; we can't ever have 2 trades open because when the condition for 2nd happen, it would definitely mean SL for the first one, right_]  
  
_OR_  
  
Is it just the latter - looking only for Short opportunity, because the mentioned candle is some sort of "maximum", and you expect the price to go down?  
  
Thanks a lot for your devotion in educating us how to use your system.

Hey Shone,  
  
Thanks for your compliments, and it seems like a lot of people have trouble with pivots, so don't worry if you feel like you don't get it now. I promise it will come to you.  
  
Basically, you are looking for the high or low to exceed the high or low of yesterday.   
So in your example, TODAY has a higher high and the lows are essentially tied with those of yesterday. Therefore, we would look to buy or sell tomorrow based on today's data. Since it is a red bar today, it would be a good idea to assume that we will have a sell tomorrow. Color makes a big difference. This also tells us that if red tomorrow, it will more than likely be a negatively sloping RSI.  
  
I hope this all makes sense.  
  
Good luck,  
Kevin

As I understand from this post and my knowledge of charting here are some other names for what are called Pivots in this post:  
  
Fractals  
Chaos Fractals  
TD Point (Tom DeMark)  
  
  
Hope this helps ...

Also, did everyone see GBP/USD?! It's being tricky!!! Luckily I'm still in long from a couple of days ago. I would look to go long if it breaks yesterday's high! Just a thought...

In my opinion the correct name would be Pivot High and Pivot Low

In order to go long, a Pivot Low should be in place; the last pivot low which I can see has been on the 11th Jan and you should have gone long on the 12th.  
  
The method which you are trying to implement is "the break of previous day's high" which is a different issue.  
  
Of course kevin will explain the situation as he is the author.

Kharvell,  
Adding to a winning position is usually a good idea. Some people call this Pyramiding. The biggest issue is getting the timing right. I do not often add to winning positions but when I do I tend to use Fib retracements to determine when to re-enter. Depending on previous wave I will enter on the 38 retracement. If you know your how currency pair behaves you can determine the best entry. It is very subjective to me. Currently I only renenter on the EUR/USD pair because I know this pair the best.   
  
I think I may begin a search into exhaustion of a move and what indicators are reliable in showing this.

howard, once again, knows his stuff![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1) In my charts I see the pivot on Jan 10th, but still would have entered on the 12th. It has been my experience that good things usually happen after small dips in a currency. With that being said, it appears that on GBP/USD, Buyers were whooping up on the market met some seller resistance yesterday, and are now back to whooping. To me, I wouldn't consider buying a bad option, just not "ideal". Use some discretion, and see if the risk is worth taking for YOU.

I've never been good with fib's.. As far as indicators go, if you look at the change in slope of RSI, it seems, historically speaking, that it would be profitable to add more when the slope INCREASES in magnitude(steeper incline and decline). Check out your daily charts, and you'll see what I'm talking about.

Hi Kharvell,  
  
First of all i would like to thank you for sharing your trading method. It seems to be easy but in the same time very profitable and accurate. My question is when is the moment of entry? In the same candle in which the magic number is reached or the next candle after the magic number have been reached.(of course if the RSI is not pointing right we will wait for the next candle) Hope I made myself understood taking in to account that English is not my mother tongue.   
Thnx again for sharing your ideas.

Kharvell,  
One strategy that I have been using for entry (I bracket the 10pm EST sideways market, when available) is to enter the market with 2 units. I set one with a limit that is the same distance from the enterance and the stop. I set the other unit with the same stop and no limit. If the price goes in the intended direction for 30 pips and hits my limit on unit one then turns around and goes back down 60 pips and hits the stop on the other unit I brake even. However if it continues in the original direction then I'm left with one trending unit and an additional 30 pips already banked. Occasionally if it is a strong move I will move my stop to brake even after the limit is hit so the worst I can do is +30 pips.   
Stop loss size depends on the currency pair.   
  
Does this make sense?   
If both units get stoped out I loose 60 pips.   
  
(1 unit is whatever size lot you use)

![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) Hi there,  
May I ask what is your "mother tongue"? I would say your English is very good!   
To answer your question, entry will be at the magic number and beyond, as long as the RSI says it's OK and it hasn't been more than 3 days. It could be today, tomorrow, 2 days, etc..

I just draw my own trendlines using [oanda](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile")'s poor charting package.  
  
FiboFan,   
I will get to your question when I have a bit more time.

Hey FiboFan,  
  
Thanks for sharing your entry strategy! I really like it! It's a good way of ensuring that you will make some good pips! I also like how the T/P differs depending on where the pivot point S/L is. I guess we have different plans of "diversification". My idea of ensuring that losses were offset was to trade 4 currency pairs, and your idea involves multiple trades in one, maybe even more pairs. I'm interested in the success you've had with this method, i.e. # of times BOTH STOPPED OUT for losses vs break evens and $$$ RIDES![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1) ! Let me know, and thanks again!

THANK YOU! You are too kind, really! Now go make some PIPS!!! Good luck![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Ok, I thought of a new way maybe to ensure understanding pivots:  
  
Pivots are alternating. With that being said, you can't have another low pivot until you have a high pivot. So we had a low pivot on Jan 10th, this indicates to look for a high pivot. As you can see, the high's just keep goin' up! Therefore, no high pivot QUITE YET, meaning NO LOW PIVOT YET![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Hope this is clear.

Realized I haven't let you guys know my trades in a while. Some of these are questionable at best as far as my entries go. I believe I have gone astray from my own method, but luckily am still profiting. In the future, I will use more analyzing because all of these were hastily executed at incorrect entries. I've also noticed that my stops are incorrect, too. The alternating pivot point thought I mentioned above is extremely important. Anyway, here are my trades:  
  
Long GBP/USD @ 1.9643 S/L 1.9606 = 71 PIPS  
Long AUD/JPY @ 94.87 S/L 94.42 = 16 PIPS  
Long USD/JPY @ 120.68 S/L 120.18 = -6 PIPS  
  
And it looks like USD/CHF is going to be a while, but if I were you, I would maybe look into entering the next trade with me![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1) But then again, I am me, and you are you, so just do what you want to do.

Soooo your looking for a new lower high to find a new higher low pivot ? Or the reverse would be a new higher low to find a lower high pivot ! Think that makes sense or else i'm just totally confusing myself and everyone else !! Suppose if you could find a chart to show what you mean it'd save a thousand words, if u have time that is ?

Billy,  
  
You are complicating things![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f644.png?v=15.1) ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1) . I am whippin' out this chart again in hopes that you might get it. When a LOW pivot point appears like the one featured below, you will then go into HIGH pivot mode where you are watching for a high pivot. This entails looking at the high values from then on. When you find the high values are no longer increasing, this should be a red flag that it could POTENTIALLY be a high pivot. If it is indeed a high pivot, then you go into LOW pivot mode, where you look at the lows using the same process. This is what I mean by alternating High and Low pivots.  
  
Hope this makes sense,  
Kevin

Kharvell,   
  
I just discovered this thread and read through all the posts last night, and thought I had your system down.  
  
However, this post confused me. Would you explain where the pivot low is that created the buy for gbp/usd at 1.9643. I don't see it, so I must be missing something. Also, just to make sure I have this down correctly, is the stop of 1.9606 based on the low of 1/17?  
  
Thanks for your help.

> As of now, I have started forward testing this week and am currently up about 700 PIPS in one week, which has admittedly been just a lucky catch. If I were to use my method (which I am), I would stick to volatile pairs.. i.e. GBP/USD.

>  A price will hit a minimum or a maximum.  
>  After that minimum or maximum, you must wait for the price to extend below the LOW (for maximums) and above the HIGH (for minimums). I usually use the spread.  
>    
>  A real world example:  
>  GBP/USD  
>  On November 16th, 2006 it reaches a Minimum of 1.8831  
>  So, we observe the HIGH of that day, which happens to be 1.8966  
>  We then add the spread to this, which for OANDA, the spread is typically 3.  
>  Our magic number is 1.8969!  
>    
>    
>  Now, the other part of my system...  
>  RSI  
>    
>  Set an RSI(10) on your graph. I would draw 2 extra horizontal trendlines on your RSI at 40 and 60.  
>    
>  Now there are several scenarios(rules) that will indicate whether to actually buy in our real world example:  
>    
>  NOTE: If a BUY scenario is not reached within 3 days(3 BARS), then we do not act upon the pivot point. That is to say there are 3 bars between the MIN/MAX day and today.  
>    
>    
> 
> 
> If our magic number 1.8969 is reached and the RSI(10) is sloping UP, ABOVE 50, then we BUY.

> Otherwise, If our magic number 1.8969 is reached and the RSI(10) is BELOW 50 we do NOTHING.

>   
>  We then sell out when the next pivot point exists, EVEN if it is 2 bars later.. Again this means a MAXIMUM must develop and the next bar must not exceed it, and also go below the LOW of the MAXIMUM.

Is your name Kharkov from the tradestation forums, if so, I've been using the updated form of your indicator for some time now, really good stuff. For all TS Users, I have provided the code below. If not TS user, shouldn't be hard to translate. I have been using this in conjunction with other factors for some time with success on many timeframes. Here is a pic of daily with RSI Pivots(red and green dots added on). This latest version was done by some user named codetalker - really amazing at coding just about anything.

Even if it wasn't your original indicator, it would seem that these pivots may work well with your buy and sell rules. I'll check it out and test it.

Nope, no relation to Kharkov, but that's interesting that his username is so similar and uses a very similar method.  
  
THANKS for providing that code! It will be helpful to a lot of people! Does it include the RSI rules in my original method?

Hi Leugimp,  
Thanks for the code. BTW, do you trade from TS7.7? New TS8.8 can not plot this indicator correctly. If you have a new version would you be so kind to upload it here (or send to me with PM)? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61e.png?v=15.1)  
  
Good trades to everybody!
