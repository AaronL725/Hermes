1)  
Thats a pretty awesome spot for some longs.  
We are right above the Monthly Pivot, RSX and stochastic are in oversold mode.... stops somewehere in the red box.  
  
3)  
Price right below Daily pivot, rsx and stochastic overbought mode.  
  
4)   
Price reacted pretty well at daily S3, rsx and stochastic in oversold mode.  
Easy long.  
  
5)   
Price right above Daily Pivot. rsx and stochastic in oversold mode. easy buy.  
  
red boxes might be **spots** for **stops**.

rsx and stochastic overbought.... price below daily R1...would be a nice sell with stops just above daily R1 level.  
  
Target might be around daily pivot.  
  
edit: just noticed the bearish macd divergence...... ---> awesome setup.

Thanks for sharing .....Even if one doesn´t trade off this it can give a quick overview of a pair.  
  
What has been your experience with the multi-pivot indicator ? As far as I know, actionforex ( your links ) has dynamically adjusted pivots as the day progresses.   
  
I`ll be happy to contribute....my best wishes.

Great looking stuff PhAnTi, this looks right up my street!  
I've been reading threads on FF for over a year now and have tried various ideas, keeping little bits from here and there, but not creating anything new!  
Currently I am working on using a MTF Stochastic and RSI cycle approach on the EURUSD. I know they are very similar indicators but I use the Stoch fast on M5 and M30 plus the RSI on M5. My intention is to try and establish when the cycle is switching or gaining momentum. I then look for a 123 entry on the M5 or M15 chart in the same direction. That’s the story so far. Doesn't sound much for a years work but its the best feeling method I have used so far. I look forward to learning more from you and others on this thread and hopefully chipping in now and then! Thanks for sharing Jonas.

Thanks for your reply.  
I didnt notice changing levels on actionforex so far....they calculate once a day....  
  
Pivots are a pretty major tool in trading...i use them more likely then fibos etc...  
  
hope to see more questions and replies from you in future.  
  
Kindest regards

It's pretty clever to watch more timeframes than just one.... you always need to have in mind which the overall trend is, up or down or sidewise.  
Stochastic is a very powerful indicator in my eyes....  
  
as i mentioned before i do play the daily pivot levels....we expect a correction from each move which is done on our charts on any timeframe and any pair at any time.  
**Theres always a correction**.  
  
So if we see a daily R1 e.g and we see that rsx (which isnt s.th big different compared to the rsi.) and stochastic are overbought price is likely to fall at this point for st least 20 pips (depending on timeframe,the bigger the frame the bigger the correction we aim for ofc.).  
  
Price is likely to....  
= nothing is 100 % in trading, we try to get a reliable edge and goot setups for good r:r ratio trades to **be profitable in the big run**.  
  
You have some good starts with your thoughts... hope too hear more from you in this thread.  
  
always keep it as simple as possible.  
  
Kindest regards  
Jonas  
  
  
Ps: will post more about London opening and the daily pivot roundabout point tomorrow

did u copied MA of RSX as well? otherwise RSX wont work...RSI is white coloured,just change it to another colour in the settings...  
  
anyway : i wont use it on metals frames except the M5 one for scalps.  
especially silver is a bull lady, if u wanna trade metals with it just look for trades thast fits the overall trend,  
  
if u have further problems with the template etc. dont hesitate to leave reply that we can fix it  
  
kindest regards

Hi Phanti,  
  
I have applied your template, but some things seem to overlap - the data window top right, and the additional multi-clock in indicator window 1 is inactive.  
  
But no problem, so far I like it and will adjust it. Maybe dumb question : the rsi shows up in magenta, the rsx not because you made it white ? Any reason for not showing it too in another colour ?  
  
But a very good working basis, I hope to contribute more with trades very soon.  
  
Once again thanks for sharing.  
  
Edit : I forgot to add this : for the London open lines and the clocks to work properly, everyone should make sure that DST and broker time are checked. My broker is GMT 0, British summer time is GMT+1, my time Germany is GMT+2 etc. ( Just an example ).

Add-on to my question about pivots - static pivots valid all day, dynamic pivots adjusted hourly, 4h etc.  
  
pic taken from actionforex.  
  
But it might be not so important. we will see.

This is cool stuff but sometime correction take long time before correction example is aud/usd on h4 from 9700 to 1.0375 without real correction and eur/jpy from 113.85 to 118.50 without any correction and if you keep looking for correction then it is very hard to trade. i know this two pairs correcting the moves right from the highs but the correction has taken such a long time that it need to correct otherwise they would have been heavily overbought if not corrected next week. at least 200 to 300 pips are there for taken if they correct at right time.   
  
I have a better divergence indicator fx5 is very old one i have 5EMa stotasthic and macd divergence which i will post lately. i am not using it since quite a lot of time so that is why it is missing from my laptop i have in my mail attached so as soon as I get there i will post it.   
  
so take care i would be watching this thread and post if there is any opportunity as i am a elliotician and divergence confirms the correction of elliott waves so I am looking forward for any help  
  
take care all

hmm...then just remove the thvmmprice and spread indicator...should work then properly.  
important thing is that you have the rsx displayed...this is the baby ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Heres what im thinking with this kind of setup:  
  
You do your analysis on H1, and i take it where you put your lines is possible places to enter right? So before you enter you would want to make sure that for a short things are not still going up on lower TFs and vice versa for a long. Lets say its seems like a good place to short is coming up. Then what id do is way until price is below MA 9 exponential, close on M1. If you want to be a bit more carefull still, you would want price to be below MA 21 exponential, close on M1.   
  
So i think id be looking at TPs of about 30-60 and SL in about the same size. How about that, seems reasonable to you?   
  
Nasir Khans <http://www.forexfactory.com/nasir.khan> SL strategy is pretty cool also, though its pretty much discretionary. He simply exits pretty quickly if things isnt going his way. He incurs a lot of losses, but they are small as you can see in his stats on his profile. You can take a look at my M1 input how it looked at those times that you marked. Also just taking TPs arbitrary because of a predermined point is perhaps a bit too inflexible, id want to check M1 and see that things are at least slowing down or reversing into a little bit of bad stuff before i close. I think its not that superimportant if you do this kind of thing on M15, M30 or H1, its mostly a matter of getting used to staring at a specific TFs.  
  
Doing the hwole thing like that would probably be profitable at about 50-70% winners about as big or bigger then the losses. SL, TP and entries can be specified ever further for slight but crucial increase in profits.   
  
Anyway dude, keep up the good work and stuff!

Yeap, switching to lower timeframes should be a pretty clever action.  
Will try the EMA 9 thing tomorrow.  
I dont wanna set fix tps...i always set them at next S+R levels, bigger tp : decreasing my lotsizes and vice versa.  
  
lets c how it's doin  
  
  
thanks for input !

Uhm heres something like a generic stoch trading Tpl. The arrows appear when candle is closed and while a 8,3 stoch has been beyond 20/80 lines and returns towards the 50 line. The lower stuch is a faster stoch that you would want to watch when it crosses the 50 line and perhaps enter.   
  
This tpl is so general it can be interesting to try it out on all timeframes. You can check out those settings and see if anything catches your fancy.

we currently trying to play with the H1 for entry signal and enter on the M1 or M5...

as u can see on the top picture we have an overbought situation. stoch and rsx are above their overbought levels.  
now i switch to the M30 frame,then the m15 and then the m5 and check whether they are in overbought mode as well or not.  
if so, i check the M5 for an entry candle....most likely engulfing oatterns.  
circled red bar would be my entry.  
  
stops are above next pivot levels.  
  
edit: two blue vertical lines show exactly the same setup , check time n date.  
  
nice to get some feedback, looking forward to your partizipation.  
  
kindest regards

download the indicators on the first post, just lick on them.  
Then copy them and paste them in c:/Programms/YOURBROKER/experts/indicators  
  
then restart your Metatrader 4 software.  
Then go to the navigator and check left folder called custom indicators.  
  
hope this helps.

> Uhm heres something like a generic stoch trading Tpl. The arrows appear when candle is closed and while a 8,3 stoch has been beyond 20/80 lines and returns towards the 50 line. The lower stuch is a faster stoch that you would want to watch when it crosses the 50 line and perhaps enter.

todays daily cable range.  
Price is currently above monthly pivot. overall trend is up.  
  
waiting for a H1 oversold setup to buy some by checking lower timeframes.  
will monitor it then.  
  
also check out how price reacted at R1 level.  
pretty awesome.

H1 : RSX and stochastic are below their oversold levels.  
M30: see h1.  
M15: stochastic isnt in oversold mode.  
M5 (entryframe) : stoch oversold and rsx kissing its level.  
  
stops below daily support 1 around 9600-9595.  
target daily pivot and so on.  
  
we have an macd bullish divergence on the hourly chart in addition.   
m15 and m5 suck on this setup,buy the bigger the frame the safer the direction.  
  
dont pump a lot here....some units cause m15 and m5 doesnt interact very good.

..interesting conclusions (and solutions ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1) ) by switching to lower timeframes to enter the trades :

ok. Here we go  
  
H1 shows us 3 possible setups for 2 longs and 1 short trade, see vertical blue lines.  
Interesting to note is that they all appear right after londons open.  
We dont want to trade the late london session.  
  
Switching to the M30 frame still shows us the 3 possible setups,still all valid.  
..i like the 2nd one at most, sto and rsx tending towards zero , 0,0 and we have a nice uspport lvl there.  
easy trade.  
  
but if we change frame to M15, we see that we couldnt get a good entry for the last trade, which would have been the worst one indeed.... the other ones r still valid on m15 and would've made a lot of green pips.

It is but it can also be confusing so it needs a bit of thought, planning and practice and such.

if rsi stays some time below or above 15/85 level we r likely to see consolidation ( lots of small candles)...often after london and new york close due to less vola.  
  
better close the profits and be fine ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Well i only trade E/U M1 you know, havent traded anything else seriously for like...6-7 months. So i mean i know what that price sort of look likes around MA 9, for anything else i can only infer vaguely that price bounces on it when its going somewhere fast. At all of those pictures MA 9 is the blue thin line and MA 21 is the thicker black one.   
  
Like so:

true.  
its pretty ok to wait for a candle closing above/below the ema21.  
  
ema9 is harder to handle cause price moves more with than against.  
  
thanks for input bro.

Thanks for your answer. Could you be more precise like at the end of bar or anytime when it becomes the extreme levels of Stoch and Rsx? Is your system made for limit order or market order? Also, how long do you usually hold the trade? Rather, how long does the market usually allow the trade to last for your system? It may sounds elementary to you, but I want to make sure. Thanks for sharing your knowledge. You are very gracious.

hmm... bro, lets take a look ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1) im kinda short trade lover, not going for big goals like 30 pips, or more. And i just watched what will happen with my trade.  
Well, i could take +15 pips ( i think thats enough for me, becuz i trade with 1 lot. so +15 pips=150$, for 1 day, i think its enough right m8? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)   
And i toked a look at history, well, if those 3 indicators shows smth familiar like today they did, 99,9 % that there will be moving up 10~17 pips safely! So my point is... Dude, ill keep testing it with my demo this week, if this will go like I ( sry, you ) said, next week ill work with this strategy on my Real accoount ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

well, im always setting stops, atm im doing with 25 pips S/L (25pips becouse look at the history, 0.01 % if ur system didnt work, price always return to the entry point so you dont loose money a.k.a. pips ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1) sometimes even can win ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1) )

Ach ... and why are they the best ones ?  
  
Tighter [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") by same amount of funds ?  
  
Better services ?  
  
Faster execution ?  
  
Never troubles with insufficient execution ... ?  
  
Multilanguage phone services and competitive / reliable TA advice ?  
  
Direct access to most important floor trader services all over the markets ?  
  
Multilevel pricing and multiple bank connections ... access to various price feeds ?  
  
Higher frequency of price changes and tick rates ? Oder wie ... oder was ?

Hello, Phanti and all.  
I started using this system, everything is fine, just few questions. In my attachment you can see that indicator predicts short, but here is no short.   
  
What you would do in my place? is this unpredictable case? Thank you for your answers.  
  
Jonas.

Hi jonas, well, you should watch all chart bars first.. not only m15 but include (h1,m30,m15,m5)   
in h1 im predicting daily trend-is it up or down,and following the movement.On m30,m15,m5 indicators should show quite similar actions, and use m5 or m1 for better entry to your trade![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
And btw, today Eur/Usd pair growth,so if following this system, there were very good entry points for buy action ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Consistency will bring everything...Be good.

tnavi: Explain - I look at the other charts and find no connection between EMA and RSX.   
  
SkullCandy: I agree, but RSX is totaly different comparing M5, M15 and M30. I agree, sometimes moving direction is the same.   
  
thanks.

first to all, sorry for my horrible english. Im from spain and sometimes i need to use google translator.  
  
this is an example that i said  
  
<http://i55.tinypic.com/2e4wy7m.png>  
  
I use EMA to know where is the price...how reference, and rsx and stoch to know when enter buying or selling.   
  
when price is under the ema, is likely to fall faster than when is above the ema.  
  
to know the "levels" i use the pivots and resistances.  
  
  
I hope I've helped a little

i have few questions, did you got those trades? Do you get into trade when you see those?   
And btw, are you trading with real account or demo? its not that easy how it is or sounds, when you took a look at history..  
when you look at history of daily,or h4,h1,m30 .. you see the picture ,and think.. oh well i could sell right there,buy over here,and sell again..   
but when ur lookin for quite good entry,not always those indicators work man,and its confuses alot of ppl ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f610.png?v=15.1) try on demo,and post pics here with trades when you enter,and we will take a look how things will go ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

if we have an oversold/overbought situation shown by rsx and stochastic price is likely to move in certain direction, but we wont have a 100 % trade.... we never will....  
its all about possibilites  
  
i search for rsx & stochastic below 15 and above 85 bevor i enter any trade

skullCandy, i hope to answer well ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/270c-fe0f.png?v=15.1)  
  
i have a real account in a forex broker about some thousands of euros. i use the forex market how a hobby, because i have other business.  
  
I always look first to chart more .. like 4 hours and i use some indicators to knew how to interpret the price.  
  
look this, 4h chart in eurjpy.  
  
<http://i53.tinypic.com/2lw0vn9.png>  
  
the price hit two times the ceiling and I think will go down. Maybe to 1.4360. That are +150 pips.   
  
then, with this information, smaller step chart you want, for example 15 min.  
  
I use this to specify the input.  
  
trading is not easy friend

in my opinion,its to early to do smth. W8 for a correction,when it confirms the downtrend,then make ur move buddy

I was wondering if anyone has attempted scalping this system on M1 or M5 and if so has it been successful? I think this system has a lot of potential and will try it out.

Hey... my name is jonas as well : p  
  
it works pretty good on smaller timeframes...its quiet laggy if you trade it without using any S+R etc.   
  
combine it with support n resistance to get the edge  
  
kind regards  
Jonas

hey,  
  
sorry for the late reply.  
  
as i used to say it in the past, try to search for overbought/oversold setups on the m15;m30;h1 timeframes with additional support or/and resistance levels to sell or buy it.  
  
a clear resistance level with an overbought price is a perfect sell setup. and vice versa.  
  
for the bigger timeframes u should also search for divergences,oversold/bought and *r lvls to get nice setups with a good r:r  
  
  
kind regards  
  
Jonas

stopped.   
  
well, never expected such a break through.  
we got supply , divergences all over the table, low volume and the daily r1 pivot.  
  
expected at least a 30-40 pip correction.   
  
stick to the trade ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
good setup in the long run. next one.

Sure buddy.  
  
First of all you need to know how support and resistance ( quiet similar to supply and demand levels on a visual basis, tough there are differences ! ) work and what they mean.  
  
\---> **Supply and demand areas are the Yodas of the technical analysis**  
  
Following two screens might clarify this a bit, Source: [www.babypips.com](http://www.babypips.com)

and

ok,here we go:  
  
take a look at the following chart, eurusd H1 with data from this week.  
  
i pointed out 3 setups, where conditions for a trade are being met.

No.1 : RSX(2) is in oversold mode (below 15 level) , we see a h1 doji/hammer pinbar and buy at close of this pin because price is likely (but not certain !) to correct some upwards after a 240 pip drop before.  
  
Remember : _Whatever goes down/up , comes up/down again._   
  
Stop would be below the previous low. Target around 4040/45.  
circled pins are the entry pinbars (at close).  
I coloured the target for trade no.1 with pink.  
As you can see it took 5 hours to hit the target. Nice, we made 50 pips by risking only 20.  
Also check how price reacted at coloured box, dropped back again because support turned into resistance.  
  
Go on with No.2 ,   
  
entrycandle : the green one in the circle. stops below the bottom blue box, because theres some confluence at demand (support) and price is not likely to drop below it without a reaction.   
target coloured in blue as well. Target is at the previous significant supply area.  
Took about 9 hours to hit target.   
  
And no.3 rsx overbought mode, price retests supply area = sell with stop above 4305 level. marked in green.  
  
**set** your **stops** always **below demand areas** and **above supply areas**. Set targets **AT** demand and supply areas because price is liekly to touch em quiet often.  
  
also use smaller timeframes for better entry candles.  
  
additional : always take trades that fit with the overalltrend.  
  
overalltrend : bullish = only take long trades ? wait for rsx in oversold mode + price kissing a support/demand area  
  
u might also add divergence to your charts to improve your trade results.  
  
Hope this helps a bit.... dont have time right now...catch ya later  
  
dont hesitate to ask if s.th isnt still clear etc.  
  
kind regards

Hi PhAnTi'  
Support and Resistance Zones or Levels are important but should not been overlooked. However none of them are signals to trade. They are opportunities to form trade plans based on likely outcomes commonly generated by such situations. For example, support and resistance levels (zones) is tradable only when confirmed by other indicators. It does not always yield profitable trade opportunities. Therefore, if you trade every support/resistance without any other indicators you would lose money. However when planned in advance and confirmed with other technical indicators, success is much more likely.   
Example:  
Double tops or double bottoms can be powerful (in fact, it indicates signs of strength) when prices is at MACD divergence (or exhaustion pullbacks, or so). Just as you are creating a trade plan based on a bounce or break of S&R, you spot MACD divergence, which is a sign that current price action is running out of steam. This would indicate that there are not enough commited traders to break S&R, so perhaps you should focus your trade plan on a rejection reversal.  
Kindest regards  
FXcube

Sure. I use RSX, and macd(divergence) in addition.  
  
works great.

well depends on the situation,previous demand7supply areas etc.... try to move your stop always to be if you are 20-30 pips in profit. also wait for confirmation of reversal

Role Reversal?  
  
If weekly support line will overrun then we could see a great sudden movement down...down...down.  
  
M15:Great chance for an Enter Long with setting a strong Stop Loss. Let the win run further up.  
  
Do realize the Hammer at M15 also. May be set a Stop Loss 15 pips under the Hammer.

no pivots, draw supply/demand by yourself.  
i bought because there was a nice demand area and rsx oversold.

price approached marked cluster (demand area) and reacted pretty fast on high volume back upwards = buyer exceeded sellers, demand locked in.   
  
In addition we do have a bullish divergence (marked light blue) and a rsx oversold setup.  
  
This is one of the setups im looking for, they work around 85 % .  
  
Altough this one was a bit closer one, because price approached demand area due news (in this case Trickie T speech) that easily could whip this demand out.

actually buyers exceed sellers if price bounces back up at a demand..but there are exceptions and other definitions as well.

If the weekly or monthly candle will forming a hammer we could have one powerful argument more for a long entry long by trading the M30/H1/H4 in the meantime. I take also a look at smaller timeframes at an engulfing pattern or so. May be it could give me anterior smoke signals.

Hello guys,  
I've been stalking this forum for about two or three months but I got tired of staying silent so I'm hoping in to post some of my trades / results. Looking forward for a new trade. I've got in at a decent area of support with rsx in oversold condition. Floating currently at around 80 pips, waiting for rsx to touch overbought condition or touch the resistance zone.

Signal on 30 minutes G/U shortly after London open, loading up a short position at a strong resistance level of 1.6460. Bearish divergence, rsx aproaching overbought level.

Hello Jonas,  
Thanks for the warm welcoming into your thread, actually I was looking forward to ask somebody around here about moving s/l to b/e. I usually looked for a good support / resistance level to move my stops beyond them and I got stopped out a few times given the fact that I was floating around 20-30 pips.   
There are a few times when you're trading against the trend, a small retracement. If we do not see any significant support / resistance level would it be advised to use fibs to get a good exit? Is it a good ideea to take into consideration fundamental things like trend lines as well?

Fibos yes, better move sl to be+1 and bank 1/2 of the units after a 80 pip rally for example,bank another 1/4 later on more 20 pips and let the last 1/4 run.

Powerful H4 support line?  
  
Not a good time for M15 even better at H4.  
  
Take a look if the support line (H4) will hold.

I've take a look at M1 and went in there (97.20) at one of thede bottoms in these uptrending circles (HH HL), but 97.48 seems okay, too, may be the 97.40 (uptrending support line).  
  
H1 RSI is uptrending. Stop Loss 10 points below the H1 Hammer.  
  
Target @ 101.24 (mR3) / 101.91 (DR3)

GBPJPY has broken the M15 EMA55 Line downwards. H1,H4 down, daily up, so market could be choppy alike for EURUSD, kinda an indifferent thing. May be it's better to trade the M1/M5 till a trend could forming out mañana.

Oh yes.  
  
H4: 38.2 Fib Level has reached (H 1.4471, actual Candle).  
  
If it could overrun next stations may be 1.4508 (50) / 1.4553 (61.8).  
  
_(I hold my shorts and will hedge the northern side)._

Still got alot of things to learn, the trade was already triggered when I got your reply. It seems that when I place my orders too far they dont get triggered at all and when I place them too near the s/r zone they get triggered like brutally instant and they head for sl immediatly.

dont take trades instantly when PA reaches a supply or demand level. wait and look how pa behaves and moves in these zones and wait for a reversal confirmation.  
  
stops always above/below  
  
kind regards

keep on.

I was also thinking about moving to higher time frames. What do you think about daily/weekly trading with this method?

Could this be a valid resistance area for eur chf? I have a short position pending at R3 which is 1.2267  
I have the feeling that I may be too far away.

Hey phanti,   
  
I've been trading a slightly modified version of this (I did change YOUR idea, not come up with my own) But i've been trading on M5 occasionally M1 if very closed to pivots. I'm up 12% in 1 1/2 months with decent MM (and im always learning).  
  
I trade on M5 as im still at school and dont have time for M30 etc.  
  
Anyway great work and thanks for the idea.

I am not that experienced in trading (just over a year) and feel that with a longer time frame fundamental analysis is more important and quite frankly I don't know much about that at the moment. I can fully understand your point, but I feel more comfortable with only being in the market for 15 minutes or even less.  
  
The changes I've made are quite small, I've been a fan of THV so I have the trix indicator from that and the added stuff on the side (but thats just aesthetics), also I use Stoch at (14,3,7).  
  
On this chart there wasn't a pivot but the 1.4500 level which I though was strong enough for a 6 pip scalp.  
  
N.B. I have the same chart set up that you use in another window on M15 just to double check ideas.

alright, try to compare rsx with stochastic, quiet the same but i prefer RSX bcause that one is more dynamic and more specific.  
  
likely to see further trade setups from you.

Yeah, I've just noticed that, RSX and stoch are basically indentical. I guess I can free up some space and delete stoch, thanks.

On M5, its looking like a good long scalp, might consider buying at 1.445 and would ideally look for 12-15 pips.  
  
Just FYI.

yep as u can see at the white marked rectangle, sellers took profit and buyers exceeded sellers at this area, so it is likely that it happens again,  
  
wait for pa to approach marked box and check for confirmation of reversal,

In the video you linked from fxstreet Steve was talking about price testing the demand zone several times. As there were more previous bounces out of the demand level he said that the level would loose it's full potential and that it shouldn't be used anymore.

I envy you for those shorts on aud usd that you've kept on 4h. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1) I took them yesterday and panicked out of them when they were at -20 pips. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1) good trades

Just wanna double check on the MA_of_RSX indicator i got from this thread, when i go to View Terminal and click on the "Experts" tab, i got a long list of warnings ..   
  
"MA_of_RSX EURUSD,M15: object name passed to ObjectSet function cannot be an uninitialized or empty string"  
  
So i'm just wondering if the RSX indi is working fine despite those warnings ? OR did i not set something correctly ? .. i mean the RSX seems to be working ok on my chart , just the warnings i see make me have doubts, so i just wanna clarify it with you guys. thanks !

Hi Ali,  
  
I've only got the ex4 , but this indi is kinda unstable, on my oanda mt4 it works but loading it onto my fxpro mt4 , it will crash it so beware. Maybe you can only use it on mt4 with build versions higher than 229.

Breakout Fading?  
  
Many false breakouts occur in forex price charts and the occurence of these _fakeouts_ provides the perfect opportunity for fading breakouts, that is, trading against those breakouts. Grace Cheng "7 Winning Strategies for Trading Forex" (Harriman House, 2007) explain in chapter "Strategy 3" why most brakouts fail and how you can identify high-probability fading opportunities.  
(Breakout Trading is then explained in the following Strategy 4 & Strategy 5 is named "Decreased Volatility Breakout" which is conceptually similar to the stragtegy of breakout trading, because in both cases the trader will be hoping for a successful price breakout).  
  
[ISBN 978-1-905641-19-2, [www.harriman-house.com/forex]](http://www.harriman-house.com/forex\])  
<http://www.harriman-house.com/search/grace%20cheng>  
  
This woman has an intelligent, dynamical writing style which is not abound among the forex literature.   
  
Best regards  
FXcube

this is one way to trade break outs, the other is to wait for close and retest to enter in a safer manner....  
as described and showed above.

Hello Phanti,  
I didn't post anything yesterday because I had an important Macroeconomics exam that I had to attend. I've recently switched to higher timeframes to get a better picture of what I'm doing. I've attached two pictures, one with a daily chart to see the important trend lines that became resistance after they were broken as resistance, the other picture is with the entry I want to take on a 1h chart. My short entry is at 1.6212 and my long one is at 1,6045, according with fib lines for the big uptrend on the daily chart 38.2 and 50.0 levels for support / resistance. I will cancel my long one if the daily rsx doesn't head for oversold condition.

hey,  
  
i dont like it to play with limit orders since u dont know whether rsx is in oversold/overbought level when limits got hit and traders gettin triggered.  
Always stay patient.  
  
6215 might be a nice level for some shorts if it holds.

always consider the timeframe u r using.  
  
an oversold setup on M5 frame might be good for max. 10-15 pips, h4 100-120 or more pips etc.

in addition try to look for supply and demand levels and combine it to get better results.

You are completely right, wouldn't take a trade on a 5m chart with a tp of 200 pips. Your take profit will always be in relativity with the timeframe you find yourself in. It would be absurd if it would be otherwise ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1). Altough there is the situation where you are have a os/ob condition on a lower timeframe which is the same os/ob condition on a higher timeframe. If you would have a good resistance/support level or supply/demand zone accordingly to your trade then it would be perfect and you could set up a good take profit. Is my deduction right?

absolutely.  
You got it.  
  
always remember and consider the timeframe you are looking at.  
  
if we have an oversold RSX (that in addition points up ) and price reaches a demand/support area we wait how PA behaves at the certain area and wait for a confirmation to the upside. Then we buy and set stop below the demand area.

Should you buy even if we have a oversold condition and the PA gets over the resistance area?

nono ... u need to understand the basics bro...  
  
**demand similar to support** ,  
  
**supply similar to resistance**.  
  
These r the very basics.  
  
So if price reaches a resistance/supply area and rsx is in overbought mode price is likely to turn and reverse a bit down.  
  
Buyers may take profits at supply and sellers come in to push price down again.  
_Sell high - buy low_.  
  
target would be first approaching support, in this example marked with white rectangle.  
Always check smaller timeframes ( i take the M5) for better entries and confirmation of reversal.

Yes i just questioned because i misunderstood what you have said in your previous post, it seemed pretty awkward to buy in a oversold condition so I had to ask ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1).

Possible short on EUR/USD 30M  
  
RSX overbought, R1 and Fib @ 1.443-40   
  
Probably good for a 50 pip trade, with TS at 35, SL 25 pips up from now (1.43345)  
  
Normally I would take this trade but I've traded already today and made my 1% so no point risking it.

Jonas,  
  
I'm new to this supply & demand analysis, but would the bit in white be an area of demand and therefore a decent place to set a TP as it also encompasses the daily pivot. like I said I am still trying to learn S&D to assist with this great system.

guys please stick to the threads intension.  
  
Trading supply and demand areas with oversold/overbought market conditions.  
  
Any timeframe, any pair.  
We usually dont include Divergences and crosses into our setups.

hey !, welcome to the thread.  
  
Timezones are unchangeable in MT4, depend on the broker u r using.  
The brokers use different times for open close.  
  
Kindest regards

why i took this trade:  
  
Daily made a LL and is testing/trying to confirm the LowerHigh at the moment on the supply zone. Price breakthorugh and S turned R, tested and prooved once so far. Now PA approached agaian at supply and we play common supply sell here.  
Altough we dont have a overbought RSX,no divergence and no serious confirmation to the downside.  
  
I took it bcause i think it might be a relaible one in the long run   
  
kindest regards

I feel you ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1). I'm at work atm, can you post a current chart with the earlier setup that we had on gbp usd please? I'm at work atm, every port is filtered so I can't get into my platform.

agree, if rsx overbought and price at supply, but remember that u need a huge sl and a huge target if u trade the h4 frame.In addition ull need lots of patience,those trades might run for a couple of days until they hit tg or sl ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
lets c whether we ll get our setup tomorrow or not.

Jonas and any other traders here,  
  
I got a signal for a Strong sell on EUR/JPY H4, similar to EUR/USD.  
  
RSX pretty much overbought  
  
Trendline from 6th june which has already been respected.  
  
Fib 23.6 line.  
  
There is also a signal on H1 aswell.  
  
So Im very bearish on EUR for next couple of days. I have a small trade with SL just above 23.6 fib at 115.65 and my TP is 114.80 which is seemingly quite a strong demand area  
  
I've got quite a tight SL so if the news from greece is negative for me, i get stopped out early ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
I think i am starting to get the hang of supply and demand areas!

im even short on ej...good chart bro, i shorted the trendline ,  
  
-17 so far. anyway my stop is 116.10 and my target is 114.01.... alltough we should wait a bit linger here, because isnt in rsx overbought mode ( above the 85 level) and doesnt point down so far. so a bit more patience and we will get a nice trade.  
  
my chart to clarify my statement above:  
  
PS: actually stops should be above the circled point on my chart, i used a different one giving me a better and more reliable RM,MM .....ill confuse later on that. remember : this is a ~ 1:1 trade and h4 frame, might take days until target will get hit etc...  
  
target obv on the next significant demand lvl because is likely to reach it if he continues down obv.

yeah I might widen my stops as we could see a whipsaw in a short time due this vote thing in greece.   
  
Cheers for the luck, I am gonna need it, I've got my last exams tomorrow ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) then I'm free to trade all summer until september!!  
  
It seems that the trendline is holding and RSX is at 83 so I reckon this is gonna be a successful trade. I must have got an almost identical entry price to you as i'm -15 currently, but you can't get everything right.  
  
See you soon,

Hi all,  
  
Just wondering if we're looking at a good setup for usd/chf 1h? Or should I be looking at following the trend? Just wondering if i'm seeing things properly...  
Thanks

Today, on my way to work I kept thinking about supply / demand zones and I asked myself what could be the fundamental explanation to this behavior of the price at that certain level? Most of the firms that deal with import and distribution inside a country keep their price levels adjusted to the currency the product is originary from. They have analysts and people that deal with financial issues and they usually buy foreign currency at a low price so that in a near future when prices presumably rise they would make more profit from selling their products. Most of the analysts' work is basicly the same because they use identical methods in determining what is profitable for them and what is not. Could this be a valid fundamental explanation to the supply / demand levels?

well i guess there r a lot of definitions,explanations etc.  
  
i use to say it this way :  
  
Markets are trending and ranging. Means investors try to buy as low as possible to take their profits at a higher level. The lower the price is,the more room is to the upside and the **more likely pa will go up again.** \--> rly relative spoken  
  
And vice versa.  
  
Why do we have certain levels and areas?  
  
Well 10-15 years ago traders worked at the pits and floors like Chicago etc, round numbers like 1.4100 , 1.4000 , 1.5000 , 2.000 etc played a far more important role than today.  
  
Why? today 95 % of traders sitting infront of their screens and trading with the computers n software. So new demand and supply areas develop.  
  
So it is easier to identify supply and demand levels,area where new sellers come in and buyers take cash from the table and vice versa than 10 years ago.   
  
Anyway psych levels ( 1., 1.5 ,1.6 etc ) still persist and work out.  
  
Thats my opinion.  
Pretty interesting topic tough, hope some others iwll post their ideas n thoughts.

Your explanation is quite valid from a technical point of view but the fundamental function of a currency is it's proper use inside a society given by the value that individuals agree upon. These individuals for example agree upon the value of their own individual work and they can trade their own surplus of their work value for other's man surplus the. Is it possible to predict strong supply / demand levels by looking upon the macroeconomic indicators which actually give the value of a certain coin ( the real value that the price will eventually have to adjust to ). What we see inside forex is a nominatory price, not a real one because there are many speculators which have a influence upon price. I'll try to take a look upon some charts and corelate some of the indicators and monetary stability in relativity with the other coin in exchange and determine the real value that a pair should come down or up to.  
  
To give you a more simplier point of view I see things like this. A man that works inside a country has a certain productivity of labour associated with his domain and he is paid in a certain coin. I want to correlate the exact same ammount of work that man put into earning a bread(raw example) with the ammount of work that another man inside another country for earning the same bread. Is their work surplus associated with that bread exactly at the same value?

Beware of buying eur/usd in this period... Take a close look on comodities in the US they won't be traded anymore over the counter. All of the traders are forced to close their positions and as most of the investors go long usually in gold they will have to close long positions which will drive the price down. Everybody is going to close long positions and speculators just like me and you will go short on xau usd which will drive the price even more down of the gold down while the price of the dollar will rise against the gold and other currencies such as eur. So we might see a little downtrend on eur usd this month until all the panic is gone and all the speculators go short on xau usd.

hey,   
  
nice to see ya in this thread.  
  
Well all we need is enough volatility to trade the setups in a reliable way.  
The Asian session is gettin more and more important and is in my opinion 100 % tradeable.

Well done Doro-I missed my original entry on the Eur/jpy short ( I was able  
to scalp 12 little pips later on) it sucks to 1- do the work 2. have a good plan & then suck at the execution. Nice job on your trades this week, stay XTRA nimble next week.

hey bro,  
  
nice to see you around.  
Well actually this system works on all timeframes if u have a well working demand/supply area and a oversold/overbought RSX.  
Important is that you adapt your targets to the timeframe,means that u usually dont aim for a 50 pip target on a M1,m5-m15 frame...instead on a h1 or h4 for example.

Its crashing probably because your MT4 is a different build , get one which is around build 401 .. or use this other indi i've attached .. but Phanti stresses that drawing supply/demand areas are best done manually.

You are either crazy or have some serious balls for going short today on eur/usd. Immagine the pressure upon greek's ministers to vote upon the austerity plan. There is only a single vote against it and that's from a socialist party. They will pass it even if the protesters would storm inside the parliament and start destroying everything, it's just the way it has to be. I went long for a very small target with a very small volume not to be too risky but it turned out a good trade. I can't post any chart atm because I'm at work

Big players are taking profit now and driving the eur/usd down that's why you see those big 1m candles and spikes. When the news will come out they will drive the price short even if the news are going to be possitive for the eur/usd. That's my personal feeling

Never ever use RSX without any other indicators.... u need to search for significant supply/demand levels in addition to RSX one

this is demo. i want to test it on demo in next month ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
i want to continue this good strategy   
  
always place stop loss below demand or above supply +15 pip or 20 pip. take profit same as stop or stop size +20 pip. best time frame is for me 1h. for indtraday trade.  
  
never open trade if price not touch or near supply or demand. and always open trade when we recive any reversal signal/ pin bar or so. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

well somehow this is a awful looking setup...but i wont take this trade because the upthrust earlier was to fast and strong.... might spike up again next few minutes.... though it should be worth a try with a tight Sl,

looks good to me.  
We do have a Big round number (9600), a good demand level,divergence on the hourly timeframe and oversold RSX setups on the hourly and on the H4.  
  
Though im not that confident with it since it crashed previous major demand with no sign of any reversals....  
  
Refresh bro,still believin that u would do a lot better if u would use a clearer template, try to scale out once for example .....play a bit with it...

same here:  
  
always wait for a demand/supply level and stoppin price at those certain areas ...also look for confirmations of a reversal.  
  
RSX was overbought but price kept rising as long PA didint hit a supply level.

hi all looking at the this closely...  
when macd amplitude is large... and the RSX is also at an extremity then an possible explosion will occur. so is it possible to combine these two in a simple magnitude indicator???  
  
Zo take size of macd and multiply by size of the rsx, maintaining the colouration for ease of reading?   
  
will this not give a sharp signal? eliminating the weaker sub set of data.  
  
Finally & an aside ...if usd is so related to oil prices, can we 'cross' data to add as a fractional multiplier to this indicator on usd pairs?   
  
regs afos 

If ask a silly question.. forgive me!i'm just confused again!

just to add we would need to change rsx to reflect 50 level as = 0 neutral..

yup...bu ti dont need the 50 level..i only look for heavy oversold or overbought setups, 85 and 15 level.... for the conservative traders we could use 90 and 10 as well....  
  
thanks for your inputs afos ! looking forward to further ideas and insights.  
  
kind regards

nice setup buddy, we do have a lot lot lot of demand here (as u cann see on the left, price reacted pretty fast in the past at this area) and rsx is in oversold mode.  
  
nice one.  
keep going...  
  
btw, try using the new template, ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

we removed pivots on the new teplate and only stick to manual drawn supply and demand areas.  
  
works far better than using pivots.  
  
here u go ....u should have all of the indicators, check the attached chart and compare it with yours after dragging the new tpl on ir.  
tell me if u need some of the indicators.

nice setup here,missed it completely....  
  
problem would've been the stop....about 300 pips large , see purple dashed line below  
  
but strong daily demand, rsx oversold on the daily, worth a try

Hello guys!  
I've given up on trading about two weeks ago as I got myself employed over a summer job and ports at my workplace were blocked so I couldn't access MT4. Today I've found a way of getting pass the ports (bribing the network administrator lol) and I'l resume my trading activity and continue the contribution to the system.

Cancelled pending order, rsx not overbought anymore. Waiting for 1h rsx to be overbought, maybe there's still potential.

rsx was not oversold at the previous level, it is now ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1), and afterall this is what the strategy is made of and I'm just following a specific set of rules without getting emotionally involved into the trade

alright, absolutely,stops below the previous lows around the 20s.  
  
if in DD, might be good reload long at the very very low with a tiny 5-10pip stop for a nice r:r trade and hedged, might be doubled or tripled size therefor.

If the next 30 min closes near 59 or at 59 meaning we have a doji or bullish hammer, I will add to my position and TP at 00

I love watching the 30min bar opening and seeing a nice move confirming our ideas, might encounter some resistance at 70 but we should push through that.

No indicator will ever return good predictions if run by itself, ofc I don't take my trades according to them but they are good indicators for s/r.

I didn't wanted to show this but I didn't control myself and after the b/e i had @ 20 I was so frustrated that I've opened a new position and that could have led me to a loss, fortunately it turned out to be good.   
  
Altough the outcome of the situation I am ashamed of myself because in the long run I would have lost.

bor please dont trade the M15 with a 7 pip spread aiming for a couple of pips,this will kill you in the long run, if you are aiming for 30 pips(which is quiet a lot for a M15 in and out trade) u pay 50 % commissions........   
  
anyway stops should be below 8818, thats the level in the sand,  
  
tryo move sl as soon as possible or bank some, gl

I think I'll short the top of supply area, you're right about 4h gbp usd not yet overbought but h1 is ob, and daily is almost too so confirmation could be pretty solid if 4h turns out on the same side of the table

u might scale in here, but i'll wait for a better price. daily might need one more day to be in oversold mode, anyway we could miss a good short entry here =scale in

I am paying so much to my broker sometimes it's killing my trades. 3 pips on all majors I've just got my application accepted by [oanda](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile") and I'm gonna transfer my funds over there the next week.  
edit: in comparisson oanda has atm on my live platform 0.8 spread on eur / usd. It's incredibly good.

absolutely, but those are dynamic [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide"), me personally prefer fix ones... might switch to dukascopy,

well check this out :   
  
<http://www.jurikres.com/catalog/ms_rsx.htm>  
  
rsx is adopted by the rsi indicator (relative strenght indicator, trend indicator,guess u know this ), it is more accurate and more dynamic

I can see it consists of smoother moving averages and different values from what I'm reading.

I didn't have time to identify false positive signals of your strategy but would it be possible to identify the cause of these signals and by adding an additional entry condition to filter out more of these bad trades?   
  
I guess that drawing supply / demand level areas are strictly intuitive and this might be the strong feature of this strategy.   
  
Hence not following a robotic pattern and rather a intuitive one you might get better signals as you couldn't be fit into the category of a regular trader which uses regular strategies based on popular indicators / popular entry points for common traders to be left as a open field target susceptible to prediction of the hand of the "butcher".  
  
This may sound awkward but I feel like this may be too simple.. too easy and too good to be true, there always has been and there always will be something fishy about easy good things because there is no such way as a "get rich quick scheme" or "get loads of money fast with no work".   
  
I see the process of making money for yourself as a productive activity that you may be developing for the society and supplying it with goods and services. There is another part of accumulating wealth inside a society and that's theft but I'll let that out of the discussion for the moment. What a trader is doing is speculating about a future price of a certain commodity/currency/stock and he bares a higher risk than others do so that "others" will benefit from his risk taking and repay him in the future.   
  
For example by speculating on the wheat market that the prices will skyrocket the next year due to a fundamental report forecasting an arid year will be of good to the users of that commodity due to the fact that the absence of speculators to sell the wheat at that all time high price would mean disaster and it would be really hard to gain that commodity.   
  
By baring the risk of the disaster, the speculator sells his wheat at that high price hence bringing the price down and serving the general population. The role of the speculator is to bare a high risk for a higher yield, that's how I describe our work and there mustn't be any way of get rich quick scheme as I never found such a example in society / economy.

pretty appreciate to hear that u r in profit and make some nice pips with this strategy (refresh q does as well, wehha does this rly work? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1) )  
  
Well doesnt matter whether we are in a ranging or trending market, we will always see corrections up and down,reversals,bounces, call them however you like to.... i tried to identify the levels/areas/zones/points where the price is likely to reverse...  
  
and where? of course at **demand and supply levels**.   
  
_What does drive the markets anyway? It's supply and demand_  
  
If price reaches a supply area, buyers might bank most of their profits, waiting for further action to buy a) at a lower price again or b) waiting for a break and buy the retest or c) try to buy the breakout itself.  
  
Anyway sellers will get into the game and sell at the supply,trying to catch a high price to sell it expecting lower prices to get out with profits.  
  
So PA will turn at supply if sellers exceed buyers and we just wanna have a slice of the cake, going with the flow, riding the wave...u know what i mean ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
Demand vice versa ofc...  
  
What do we actually need to be succesful and profitable in trading?  
  
There are **only** two things:  
  
1st : We do need a system with a positive expectation value.  
  
This should be clear. If we dont have a system that gives us consistently pips we cant make money....  
  
2nd: We do need a proper money management and risk management plan.  
Means that we need a proper and reliable MM that we can stand larger drawdowns etc. trading a positive expectation system (there's nosystem givin u a 100 % hit rate etc.).  
  
If we combine those aspects, if we stay patient, if we dont get greedy etc.....we will make it.  
And at the end it's all about money, and u'll have a lot of it....  
  
i'll be honest to you guys, i dont care about my equity at the moment, i do care about my pips, pip netprofit etc. cause im freakin 20 years old and dont have any funds so far to trade for a life. (guess u need at least 20 k to do so, depends on your needs etc.).  
  
...  
I completely lost the overview of this post ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1) hope it is somehow enlighten...  
  
please never stop to ask questions etc. ! Thats the way i've learned all this stuff as well....  
  
and there are no stupid questions,just stupid answers ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

First of all each system does have false signals, one more one less....  
  

> Quote

That's a pretty tough question.  
There are a lot of indicators out there showing us different things,  
we have leading indicators, we have lagging indicators, but there are no indicators showing us the future or even predicting the future.  
  
That's impossible.  
  
There are indicators showing us the ''Strength'' of a trend, we might say well the bearish trend gets weaker, we should look for a reversal and a possible buy area.  
  
There are indicators showing us mathematic based levels etc. ( like fibonacchi,murrey math,pivots calculated by previous highs and lows etc.).  
  
But the problem is the following...  
  
Which indicators should be combined to get a good result? which should work theoretically? which dont? Does it make sense to combine a rsx indicator with bollinger bands? what do they say ? do their effects playing together?   
  
etc.  
  
ok missing your point now, yes im sure that there are ways to increase our hitting rate and filter out some losers, but hell, i dont know

no EA,no indicator can replace the humans sense. Never.  
Try to learn about supply / demand, it's the core of this system.  
And PLEASE guys, please draw the demand and supply areas by urself, if you arent sure post ur chart and we can discuss it here.  
  
Sources of supply / demand education that i highly recommend :

Well agree, you're right.  
The good old ''get rich quick scheme'' .....well ill be honest to you, if you start with 10-20 k , making your 30 pips (30 ! ...thats tiny...) daily (on average of course) you'll be rich in less than 3 years....  
  
Thats the mindset topic....will talk about it later.

also agree on that. Though cant say much about that cause i dont trade for a live so far.... i guess it's a completely different thing when you start to depend on trading and on profits and when you need to withdraw at least once a month...

Well thats a quiet complex thing now.  
Lets say it this way : Traders are investors, you also risk some of your capital to get a higher reward. Take it as a business, not as a game or s.th else.  
  
Starting with the h1 up to the monthly chart forex is a **long term investing** business as well.  
  
So dont place a trade based on a h4 chart and sit hours n hours infornt of your screen waiting to bank the profits finally...wont work...u'll get impatient and make losses and mistakes.  
  
  
thanks for your inputs.

Phanti I'm just referring to a speculator (us) as a person that for example buys a certain currency considering that he will provide somebody else's demand for that currency at a certain time in the future so the trivial implications of regular people looking at what speculators do is fundamentally wrong.   
  
I was trying to point out the fact that there is no get rich quick scheme inside the society and that currency trading into the market is a process which has it's limits strictly tied up to the fundamental aspects of the trade inside that certain society. So I'll never trust any get rich super fast easy scheme as there is no such thing. Maybe because you're baring a higher risk than anyone else inside a society you will be highly reward if successful and highly punished if wrong.

By dedicating myself full time to a certain strategy I'm open to finding ways of improvement for that strategy and I can see that a major flaw that we are commiting is missing out profitable trades and possibly taking losses.   
  
Overall the strategy may be NET profitable but if we miss good trades and take bad trades only then we will loose even with a viable strategy so I'm thinking of an indicator that monitors the values of RSX on all currencies on all timeframes. Maybe there is some option of exporting indicator values inside a excel table to alert us when RSX values are below or above a certain value and never miss a good trade again?

I have the ideea of taking the RSX value calculation formula and introducing OHLC data from an external source ( it is possible, I've done it before ) and creating our own independent true RSX values possibly with a sound alert when it is below 15 or above 85.  
  
  
edit: Based on the value alerts that we may receive we may then be able to do intuitive deductions into the charts and take better decisions. We may see additional patterns as multiple currencies that may be correlated to find themselves at certain supply/demand levels in oversold or overbought conditions at the same time thus giving us better chances for a successful trade.

Sure, but i dont wanna talk about society here. Sure mass psychology(herd instinct etc.) is a aspect of trading ( supply and demand again ) but let's keep it as simple as possible and lets take it technically and as a business.

Sure,that would be a great way to get a overview of all pairs we wanna trade.  
Guess there are some coders in here that are able to code such a dashboard.  
  
Ill contact them.  
Anyway the supply and demand levels need to be drawn manually, so we can just check the RSX alerts whether we do have a demand or supply area as well.

Of course, I'm just here just for business, tech baby! I'll check out RSX calculation method to see what it is made of, chunk it into bits and see if I can get the variables that it uses from a internet source to be uploaded directly into a excel spreadsheet. I hope you don't mind if i come up with new ideas as past "system fathers" have been.

these were very nice entry's for me...  
  
Anyway, i like the first idea of this strategy: looking for reverse on pivots in overbought/oversold areas. Of course i put my attention on supply/demand levels, everyone had to do this. But the RSX and Pivot-Levels are perfect ensemble for me. I love pivots ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60d.png?v=15.1) This strategy works for me in this way, and i guess this it what counts at the end ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/270c-fe0f.png?v=15.1)  
  
Thanks again phanti for this strategy (and sorry for my bad english ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61e.png?v=15.1))

guys take a look how long those h1 and h4 trades run until they hit some certain target areas.  
  
trading the h1,h4 etc is a longterm invesstment game.

pips are pips...  
  
anyway dont use a 15-30 pip trailing stop if trading h4 frame, this might take at least 3-4 days to get into profit (around 100-150-200 pips)

Hello Jonas and all regular traders on this excellent thread.   
  
I have a couple of questions re RSX.   
  
Given that it is similar to a smoothed RSI I presume some of the normal guidelines apply to this.  
  
Eg Regular Bullish and Bearish divergence can be derived from this negating the need for a MACD indicator.  
  
Also wondering whether Tarantula Bull 80/40 to 60/20 bullish to bearish phase shift apply.  
  
Most of all I'm pleased to see a heavy leaning towards Supply/Demand levels.  
  
Keep up the good work.  
  
Cheers

Hey Jonas  
  
Oh I thought the questions were straightforward but I'm happy to re-phrase !  
  
Q1 Can RSX be used in the same way as RSI to see Regular Bullish and Bearish divergence ?  
  
Tarantula has a theory that with RSI when the value ranges between 80 and 40 we are in Bull territory. When the Bull Phase ends and it shifts to Bear Phase RSI ranges between 60 and 20.  
  
Okay so given that RSX is a smoothed version of RSI do you think same guidelines could apply ?  
  
As to EURUSD we've just had a 5 wave move up from 1.4012 to 1.4535. Typically these are followed by ABC correction. Yesterdays leg was A a rather sharp move following more negative comments from German finance minister set the tone for the day then further risk off due to helpful US Debt issues.  
  
Weekly R1 capped the rise at 1.4525 This is why I think pivots are v important especially to Intra Day Traders. Of course if you are playing off H4 then not so much but quite a few on here seem to use 15 min charts in which case I would say they are essential.  
  
Overall I really like the tone of this thread lots of PA analysis based on Supply and Demand zones with just a couple of indicators for confirmation. That is the important point .. confirmation !  
  
Good trading day to all  
  
  
V

Hi Dorobantu   
  
Run your fib from the 1.6004 low and you'll see something even clearer at 23.6 and 38.2  
  
As in Eur clear 5 wave move up so ABC correction would be typical yesterday was leg A  
  
Best regards

![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1) You're right, but from my previous fibs experience I think that using various HL - LH - HH - LL can give a good view upon where support and resistance levels are.   
  
Where can I read about the ABC correction you're talking about?

Hey Guys  
  
Clear illustration there how Demand zones don't last forever ! Was about 6 visits to "the well" before it evaporated. Every visit soaks up some of the demand.  
  
Would now expect a re-test of both the DZ and the recently broken uptrend support line. This is now leg C of the ABC correction.   
  
Best to all

I guess yes. Never thought about it so far, would like to see some setups/charts from you ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
btw drag a rsi indie to the tpl in addition and compare it with rsx, quiet similar.

Hi Jonas  
  
Here's a chart as requested.Some may argue over the exact points of the 5 wave move up but the ABC type correction is fairly clear. Typically leg C is either 100% of A leg or 61.8 of A  
  
61.8 is right in the previous supply now possibly demand zone.   
100% is around the dark blue horiz line near the daily S2 pivot.   
  
Now the really interesting bit is what happens when leg C is finished. If it trades back into area of leg A in a typical overlap then all the conditions have been met for a typical ABC correction. If we then see a break above leg B then I would expect a new 5 wave up with the move from C as the 1st leg of the new move up.  
  
Different way of looking at things but takes into account market structure and DZ and SZs.  
  
  
Regards  
  
  
V

Hi Doro  
  
I think that is a good play. As well as demand the Weekly S1 is at 0.8722 and should provide additional support. That's if it gets there of course !

Look at eur gbp 15 m 30 m 4h all oversold, you can still trade 15 m tf for small tp like 15-20 pips but it's risky because all eur pairs are a falling knife and I don't want to catch any falling knife ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1).

Keep and eye on usd chf 15 minute tf, getting closer to overbought area. Might need to take it for a 15 pip walk down the hill.

Hey Doro and Bully   
  
Have a llok at the EU/USD chart I posted earlier. You will see that the C ? level is slap in the middle of that demand zone u just posted.  
  
You are right if position trading always wait for the market to come to ur target.   
  
Nothing wrong with picking up 15-20 pips on 15 min TF tho whilst waiting !  
  
Regards

Hey Villonius,  
I don't understand much out of elliot wave charting because from my point of view many other points could be designated to be A B C lines but it's not something to be neglected either. We can see how it works along with this strategy.  
  
Best regards

Hey Guys   
  
I'm not sure exactly what the current strategy here is ! I've read through a fair bit of the thread and it seems to have changed quite a bit from the initial strategy of 15/30 TF !  
  
It seems Doro now uses an H4 DZ/SZ with OS/OB RSX with a bit of MA thrown in.  
  
Bully seems happier on the 15 TF with Stochs and RSX plus pivots.  
  
Last Template I saw from Phanti was a plain 1 Hr with RSX and MACD plus 365 and 150 EMA  
  
My chart was just to give an idea of market structure and where price might go taking into account DZ/Z and typical ABC corrective structure.  
  
Perhaps Phanti could give a quick clarification on what the current strategy is.  
  
Best regards to all  
  
  
  
V

Pretty bad cons, -1%. Let's hope for a slightly positive actual and eur usd might hit our buy targets.

Hey Guys  
  
One more point to bear in mind is that EU/USD has already done 145 pips today Ave last 60 days is 138.   
  
Yesterday was a big liquidation of long positions which is why it moved so far.  
  
Just saying there probably isn't a lot more down side today.  
  
Also notice how price is oscillating around Weekly Pivot. Resistance at Daily S1 support around the 1.4250 round number. Also can see PA is shallowing out.  
  
Regards

Thanks Jonas  
  
Thats pretty similar to my basic setup although I typically use a Stochastic mainly for when the market goes into a consolidation.   
  
RSX is definitely interesting I'm curious how often the 85 15 levels hold when the market is trending. You know how all Oscillators get caught when market trends.  
  
Basically as I understand it you look for RSX in OB/OS at SZ/DZ on H1. How do you pick your entry ? You look for PA signal like Hammer followed by strong bar or Bullish/Bearish engulfing in the zone ?  
  
Regards

Not only on the h1, works on each time frame.  
  
I try to get a good price at demand and supply levels to increase my r:r ratio.  
Of course pa needs to confirm a reversal first.

Phanti I see that you have 10k posts, you're quite old on this forum mate and I suppose you went through a lot of systems on your way to being profitable in trading. What's your experience upon the first 1-3 years of trading? How did you came up with the idea of using this system?

I placed my first live trade 11 months ago. I never have played demo....  
  
blowed up my first live acc testing EAs and stupid systems,blowed up the second one....  
  
then i got lucky, met the right people and the good threads, started to learn about PA,supply,demand....  
Got the feeling how markets move, what makes them move etc....  
  
still trading peanuts cause i dont have any funds right now to trade with.  
  
The idea of developing a supply/demand system came with my supply/demand studies in the price is everything thread.  
  
all in all everybody who wants to be profitable in trading needs a firm overview and overall knowledge about the markets and the fundamentals.  
Theres no other way. You need to know what actually drives the market.  
  
It's supply / demand.  
  
It's not about posts etc, it's about willingness to learn....  
Ask your self the following questions:  
  
Why do i wanna trade the markets and especially forex?  
Will i keep learning and trying even in worse days?   
What do i expect from my trades? Long time gains ? Entertainment? some real fix n solid income?  
Am i ready to risk my own capital ?  
Can i risk any cash at the moment?  
  
etc. pp  
  
ill tell you that im 100 % addicted to it, do have a lot of fun being in the markets and wanna make it to my full-time job.  
Thats why i kept studiyng,posting and trading for the last 11 months, each fuckin day, 4-6 hours / day.

everybody can,it's just a mindset thing.  
Great thing in forex is that u can trade as much as you can ( units ), **it's just all about pips** , if you can earn them u'll trade 1000 $ pips at some point.

Phanti I have my pending buy at that very low ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1).  
  
Sometimes I feel frustrated but I need to control myself.  
  
About your trading experience and your future in trading forex, I've met alot of people that have gave up what they wanted to initially do and they've went on doing a regular job that they didn't like in the first place. Most of those people slack during the job or don't give the best at it. I admire the few people that have come to the point in life when they work with pleasure and they can make a living out of. Good job Phanti, you're an example!

Nice job Bully  
  
I agree that finding OS conditions at Demand Areas is a v good strategy. Sometimes a bit tricky exactly where to find your entry as Phanti points out.  
  
In the attached chart of EUR/JPY 15 min I've drawn an Equidistant channel with touches at 1 2 and 3. Notice around area 3 how price starts to break out of the bottom of the channel and then bounces back in followed by another break below and bounce back in.  
  
The are happening AFTER RSX has reached OS and started to reverse. When you see this it is evidence of clear divergence.  
  
It is followed by a break out of the channel into the demand zone breaking below Daily S2 pivot. If you check your hourly you will see 110.87 is a support level. As soon as it bounces back to the channel off that level you are good to go.  
  
Break outs of channels are usually followed by a strong move in the other direction. Here you have confluent factors.  
  
1) Demand Zone.  
  
2 Support Level at 110.87  
  
3) RSX coming out of OS  
  
4) Price divergence RSX - up PA went down  
  
  
notice there was strong move back inside the channel followed by a re-test of Daily S2 Pivot.  
  
I have found E Channels a great way to spot PA divergence.  
  
Regards to all

remember that you need to be able to stand a DD in case price reaches low of demand level and you bought right above it, thats why i try to get a good price in the demand level itself.

Only during Market Turmoils Oanda will expand the [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide"). That's okay, I think. They track a fair business praxis.

Well yea, basically I avoid news events and such so I'll look at the spread and if it is suspect high I'l take a guess that news might be released soon. Many times I make the mistake to forget about the release hour and just get into trades that hit my sl instantly. Maybe the high spread will keep me from trading news times ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1). ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Thanks.   
I really like this style of trading. It really gives you a better idea of where the price might go. Im just learning how important pivots and supply and demand zones are. i wish i would have concentrated more on price action for the past few years.  
Ive started reading the Price is Everything thread. Very good thread.  
Enjoy the weekend.

Thanks for your response.  
  
''Don't expect something from indicators that they cannot afford'' .  
  
You need to master price action analysis and you need a firm experience and knowledge about order flow. We do get an awesome edge if we combine it with supply and demand areas and an indicator showing us oversold/overbought market conditions.  
  
I guess there are thousands of systems out there working pretty well,of course some do better and some do worse, you just need to find one that fits your personality. Stick to the rules, if you do have a system once proofed stick to it and make a fuckin living out of it.Play a proper **M** oney**M** anagement and become happy.  
  
Anyway the less indicators you use and the cleaner our charts are the better overview we get from current market situation in my opinion, heard about a guy just scalping a 13 SMA making thousands of dollars a week.  
  
\--> You need to know what you are doing and how the system you're trading really works. <\---  
  
Keep reading and charting, post charts,ask questions et cetera. Thats the only way you can master this business/learn the required stuff about it.   
  
Dont expect a 'get rich quick' event, won't happen (there are exceptions of course).  
  
so take care.

Hey Your system works well if strictly adhere to rules.Why I am saying that is I entered too early and burned with 10 pips. Then with all rules agreed I got 25 + in next trade. Keep improving my self with this system. Thanks Phanti. I will add charts for good set ups soon. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

EUR/USD M15 moving into Overbought zone on RSX, looks good for a short looking for 1.4400 or even 1.4380. Just an idea.  
  
Even H1 is in overbought zone.

Small short at 92 with larger sell limit at 00 followed by a smaller one at 8809 on EUR/GBP, looks like a good opportunity.

No got 30+ pips in a very quick time,   
  
E/U might be a good shorting opportunity soon, as we are at resistance and M5 shows Sell, might wait for M15 to sell and hopefully be around pivot and 1.4300 pysch level.

I am assuming you are talking about me, dont worry i only screen capped that screen the tab next to it is purely RSX MA, trendlines and S & D, just I like the extra confirmation of a few more indicators.  
  
Still I am pretty profitable with a combination of Phantis template and my other indis, and am up 68%, with very tight MM system of 0.75% loss per trade for 1% gain per trade.

hey Dany or hey Joe? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
  
well RSX was in oversold mode and price approached a demand area (circled spot) , u actually wait for at least 1-2 hourly candles closing above the lowest point of the demand area and search for some confirmation of reversal.  
  
guys, never buy blindly at demand and sell at supply levels, u need additional patterns etc. to increase the edge and the profits of this system.  
  
anyway if we'd enter here as low as possible with 1:2 r:r we would have a triggered stop and a losing trade but in the long run we are profitable with it.  
  
This was a huge run today on the aussie...

Well anyway **we always need to ask the following questions** before we enter a trade:  
  
**Where do we enter? Why will we enter at this certain point? Where do we wanna close our position with a) profit (targets) or b) a loss (stops) ?**  
  
Well i would've had 3 possible levels to enter long at the demand, see the 3 black horizontal lines( low,middle and top of previous range. stops below the demand area. **But** ! we didnt have any sign of a reversal yet, so we dont enter this trade.  
Dont see demands and supply areas as walls, take em as obstacles that stop price and push him back for some time before another run.  
  
Supplys and demands are there to get broken ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
hope this i clear, if not....please keep asking !  
  
  
  
also see the h4 explanation regarding Bullzeyes and Jeremys AUDUSD trades, ill go into more detail then.

hey buddy,  
  
absolutely, i did have the same area. But ! RSX isnt in oversold mode on the h4 so far ( see screen ) and we dont have any kind of confirmation here to take a long.... so stay patient and wait for a possible buy here ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
...anyway with such a sudden move i get more n more afraid of buying here right now, better sell some retest of broken demand areas turned in supply now. ( here for example sell a retest of the coloured previous demand area...anyway thats not part of the system at all,just my style of trading.)  
  
my chart :

always wait for RSX in oversold or overbought levels to turn its direction and the backgreound colour changing from green to red and vice versa.  
Maybe we can filter out bad trades this way

True. Everybody should know what the indicators on his/her template tell us and what they represent.  
  
If you dont understand your template, you dont understand your trades imho....

...and Daily Candle has reached the EMA55 Line.  
  
...and 1.057-1.0520 could be a favored H4 support. When this line will be broken then good-buy!

again : Wait for confirmation and some consolidation at demand/supply areas.  
If we dont have signs of possible furhter reversals we are facing a strong move, and we dont wanna countertrend a strong move or trend.

You're arguments is logicla when you say that you don't use EMA lines. You're argument aren't logical when you say "they are all bullshit". Okay it's your opinion. Why not! Your argument aren't logical when you say they don't work in a long run. It's a daily chart not a weekly or a monthly. So there is nothing to say in terms of long run. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

well at a demand area we need to search for buyers that come in , like a bullish engulfment oattern on the m15/m30 etc. or a doji closing above the lowest point if the demand area.  
  
ill search for osme examples later and post them here.

coloured box is our demand area,  
  
and the boxed pinbar break thorught the demand area but closed in/above it, means the area below is defended by buyers and buyers exceeded the sellers. we wait for the close and go in for long if rsx is in oversold mode.

ok, why didnt the candle in the black box close below the previous demand area ( marked in peachpuff colour ) ?  
  
why we got more buyers than sellers in the area below the demand area,means the pinbar closed above the bottom range of the demand ( = support) area and more buyers went in = price goes up.  
  
hope this helps,  
  
anyway try to improve your english, thats actually the most important variable in here to learn and contribute ....doesnt take that long, some months and you're up-to-date....also try to read as much as possible and take a dicitonary of your mother's tongue to translate words and terms if you dont understand them, you will understand them next time then ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

ok now I understand the second figure .. Forex Basic ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
if I am correct this is to understand more precisely the demand area  
  
once the price is in that area.. just wait for the MACD and Stoch go up  
or there are other signs that show the changing trends with more confidence?

doji on h4 with rsx oversold mode, target previous demand area cause we expect the deamnd area turned into supply one.

price action,order flow, patterns etc...you need a firm overall knowledge about the market, you cant trade profitable just by following strict entry/exit rules, you need ''the feeling'' about the markets movements.

na with limit orders we try to pick a price near the top and near the bottom,sell stops and buy stops just go with the flow,but u usually get worse prices, depends on your style of trading though

sell stop if you want to sell price lower than current ,   
sell limit for higher than current price   
  
actually sell stop bit dangerous, it might executed miles a away during news time

EUR AUS H4  
RSX over sold  
Approaching near supply area.  
But trend is very strong and yet dont have any reversal confirmation from PA.  
candle or etc.   
once reversal strong sign showed up. a gud r:r is possible.  
  
\--not supporting AUS Slowing Economy and RATE down rumors in near future. might be pushing AUD to push down further. so cuation and must need a strong reversal signal from PA + .

I'm not disappeared  
I'm practicing .. find the areas of demand and identify precisely the points of entry ..  
are 132 pips for today ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
but still are not clear .. Sometimes I go negative and then recover after time ..

There was also a pretty large trendline coming in there, so I did at larger longs there and basically diluted my earlier Longs so currently around BE. Bad timing but it seems like its reversing and 1.09 seems like a decent target, with SL and BE after a break of 1.08.

Hey Anpips,  
  
first of all thank you for your chart and your post.  
second i'll give you my heads up regarding eur aud, note: usually i dont trade this pair at all.

It's over**bought** ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
..circled area would've been my supply area, but pa just crossed it with no shake = very strong move. So i dont wanna sell here anymore. The more i hope that the supply turned to demand and try to buy at a retest of the previous supply area.

u just sold after a break of the supply area.... thats a pretty bad move, sry bro...  
  
there are two possible lines : either yu trade the breakout or you buy a retest of the supply and hope for a supply turned demand area (works pretty well).  
  
sry for the loss, hope you got out cheap?

hey bro,  
  
stay patient and wait for this supply : We try to sell **as high as possible** to get maximum r:r's ...  
  
also search for divergences and wait for rsx to be in oversold/bought mode,

guys...  
  
it seems that you are first watching for RSX oversold/overbought levels and then start drawing supply/demand areas....  
  
**BUT** this wont work.... you need to draw/mark the very significant supply/demand areas and try to keep the ranges as close as possible to get better results. Ill post some examples later on,  
  
  
example : see the post on the top of this page where i quoted bullzeyes gbpusd chart

as mentioned above, **price broke supply and we expect that resistance turns to support now.** , means shorts are actually the worse line imho  
  
anyway the doji on your chart looks ok for a short...but that doesnt have anyhting to do with our startegy here ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
good luck though bro!

yep,this supply area looks good to me. try to pick a high price at the area with tight stops right above it, i guess we will break it if we touch it again....because we tested it several times, if we dont close above on the weekly this week we are likely to ggo lwoer again.  
  
a h4 close _IN between_ the supply area shows strong sign of an imminent break of it.  
  
so sell very high and move stops quickly.

Gbp/nzd reversal opp.  
R:r ratio possibly very good.   
Waiting for a strong reversal signal .  
  
H4  
  
over bought in rsx  
approaching supply area   
yet no reversal signal through price action. Very strong move. Major trend is down trend.  
  
Fundi:  
  
Boe might disappoint today. Gbp will be under pressure soon.  
Nzd rate is is likely in near future. So favourit currency after aud rates are likely to be lower.

please check out the analysis.

note this is a weekly chart..... on the monthly last 10 candles closed in green...overbought all over the table,  
  
weekly supply cluster might good for some longterm shorts, ill try to pick a good price to set some.  
  
it's almost certain that we will see a correction at the previous weekly top ( 2008 drop level ) ,that will be the first retest.

Hi Phanti  
  
Here's a more detailed look at Eur/Jpy 1 hr. Supply levels taken off 4 hr.   
  
Interesting points. Re-test of channel at point 5 on Monday strong bounce. BOJ intervention pushed price right into Supply level with high probability of drop due to :  
  
1) Area of Supply  
  
2) RSX way OB  
  
3) Failed re-test of Support TL   
  
Nice pips for all  
  
  
Best regards

It is just binning.

worth to short Euro/aud with tight SL and target of 1.3284/92 , upside risk broke of R3 may open door for 1.3812 and 1.4270/80, rsx shows it been over purchased. additionally last week aud was over sold cross all pair after RBA rate decision , expecting aud to bounce now. good luck  
  
Edit : **Tight SL then moving SL to BE is highly Recommended**

thanks Jonas, i am very happy about this one...closed this with 187 Pips ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61e.png?v=15.1)  
  
so if you can see i`am entered that trade on m15 after a reversal-candle, maybe thats the game with this strategy: after finding your setup on H1 or H4 you just look for an entry on a smaller timeframe![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

sure, we check the daily/h4 frames for major supply/demand areas, areas where price is likely to turn, then we got m30/m15 and wait for a confirmation of a reversal and place a trade with stops below/above demand/supply area.  
  
keep going mate !

since you are in the right thread you will need 1-2 years (depending on the time you are investing per day) to make consistently pips.  
Then you just need to adapt your MM and trade 2-5 years ( depending on your starting account) to be/get wealthy ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
at the end...it's all about the cash...

no certain demand here, BUT we do have the 1.0000 level which represents a nice support level, h1 pinbar closed above and rsx was oversold,  
  
worth a long... remember it for the future, those very big round numbers work great, such as 1.000, 2.000 etc.  
  
here u go :

although Markets are almost in worst then ever times.  
fundies are changing every hour. for new trader like me it is hell  
  
**BUT**  
  
i am doing better, only becuase i learned here  
1\. how to stick with rules.  
result. i did not lose a single penny in last 10 days but gain.  
2\. i am confident on my charts then ever.   
3\. i can see why Price move or market moves. i helps me to be on right side on price action.  
4\. my R.R ratio is very good because i learn to wait for A Grade op.  
  
All this is happening because i am here in this thread.  
Focusing where should focus.  
other then waste of time and money.  
  
GL new mates.

u r on the right track,,  
  
  
Price action,  
supply/demand  
orderflow,   
levels,  
FA analysis ,  
Moneymanagement,  
riskmanagement,  
discipline...  
  
start charting,trading demo, you need a feeling of how to set tps,stops, open orders etc.  
  
regards

all in all you always need a brief overview of the currencies you are trading.  
You need to follow the news,fundamentals etc day by day.... = at the beginning it is better to concentrate on 2-3 pairs like eurusd,gbpusd and eurgbp ( obv. only 3 single currencies).  
  
Markets are pretty nervous this week, horror for scalpers

How about this guys USD/JPY H4, RSX not oversold yet...so be patience and careful on that, just wait for sings of reversal...the bottom looking freaky

Hello Everybody,  
  
This is a great thread. A great contribution to the FX community.  
  
I really like the colored RSX indicator. However, is there a Multi-Timeframe RSX indicator available somewhere?  
  
If the answer is no, can someone help write one?  
  
It would be of great help, if, on one chart, I can see the higher timeframes as well as the current timeframe RSX indicators all at once to determine the trends of higher degree.  
  
Thanks and PEACE.

No.  
We dont need a multi tf rsx indie, just open some more charts then to check trend etc. or switch the tf in the opened chart, as simples ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

i will try my new template for a few days from now...  
  
i throw the MACD out and take the stochastic indi. So the stochastic-cross will give me clear entry signals.   
  
So i am looking for overbought/oversold situations of RSX and stochastic at the same time and of course possible support/resistance levels...  
  
I am trading the higher TF from H1.  
  
**NZD/USD** H1...nice support, RSX oversold, Stoch cross up

Nice mate....actually i hoped for 5-6 additional traders posting here etc....   
  
yes it is, because we trade demand and supply levels here, and demand and supply is what the markets drive..... it's that easy....  
  
  
keep on.

Hello guys,  
I'm sorry for missing out this last month but I've been involved in a serious accident and for obvious reasons I've decided to seize my trading activity during the recovery period. For now I feel better and I will be able to contribute from my bed.

Been looking through this thread on and off for the past week, generally looking for ideas as i was playing around with some trading concepts of my own, but similar to this. Trying to keep things as simple as possible.  
  
Saw this on g/u a few minutes ago so I thought Id throw it up for comment. Old support now resistance around 1.5740, down trend line and stoch over bought, but rsx perhaps not as over bought as its meant to be for this method.   
  
what worries me is the down trend line is a bit, _old_ and could well break.   
  
anyway, thought id throw this out there for comment.  
  
h2  
  
edit: have taken a few micros short for crack, SL- 1.5758

g/u update, took half off the table at 1.5695. 1.5684 is a level which could act as support imho, as it has respected it the past couple of days. also moved to BE on the rest (1.5730)

yes, looks like a small support there. On H1-chart rsx and stoch are also oversold, i would wait for a clear reversesignal, furthermore there a upcoming news in a few minutes, be carefull...

Could these daily levels of g/u be valid for a small 1h reversal?

i just follow to this two rules:  
  
1\. Not to trade the upcoming news  
2\. Always wait for clearly signs of reversal  
  
I think the next candles shows us the right way![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/263a-fe0f.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f4ad.png?v=15.1)

yeah, wasn't planning a long, just mentioning the area of support, which has now been blown through.  
  
took my second lot off at 1.5670, could have had a lot more but never mind, was not at the computer to manage it through the news..

I think we should have taken the gbp usd 1h, remember the chart I posted earlier about it. It bounced off instantly, I feel bad for not taking advantage of those 50 pips.

well case is the following,  
  
you should have taken a higher price for an entry, since this is a h4 timeframe you missed the first 100 pips down from the supply area, means that you could have moved your stop to BE or even bank in profit.  
  
late entry.  
  
anyway keep on and include this in further trades to improve the result ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

all in all the analysis was nice.   
We did have a nice supply level with an overbought market condition.  
  
= price is likely to turn and correct a bit = we enter the trade with a nice r:r ratio and catch the pips.  
  
Please note : the previous move was pretty pretty strong,solid and fast. So actually we dont want to fade the trend.

I try to post at least one analyzed chart a day...so here we go for today :  
  
Daily EURAUD chart.  
  
I marked the major supply and demand levels out.  
  
About 3000-4000 k pips this year by trading the very major supply and demand levels on **one single pair**!  
  
Screen time : ~ about 20 minutes a day.  
stress: whats that ?  
  
Trading 1 standard lot and you earn 30 000 - 40 000 €..... so where's the problem?  
  
Dont hesitate to ask any kind of questions at anytime..... i might need several days to answer them though.... daily job etc.  
  
Jonas , have a nice weekend guys.

3400-3500 area could stop this baby for the moment in my opinion, absolutely nice spot to load some longs with tight stops.

Good morning everyone!  
  
First of all I want to thank Jonas for sharing his system and everyone who contributed to this thread. Although I didn't read every single post (I'll surely do the next days) I already learnt a lot. The system really seems to fit my trading style and I hope I finally found my own "holy grail".   
  
Today I'll start to post my live trades in this thread. As I'm a little bit busy the next weeks (studying for some exams...) I won't have so much time to trade...  
  
Let me just introduce myself: My name is Daniel and I'm from Germany (-> English is not my mother tongue - be patient with me). About one year ago I started being fascinated by FX. I tried many different systems, EAS,...etc...though in the longterm every single approach wasn't successful.  
Finally I searched for people at FF who seemed to be successful in the longterm (especially in the interactive trading forums) and tried to figure out what some of them have in common. Two key words I often found in the posts of this guys were: S & D, PA...So I learnt more about these concepts and finally found this system. I hope this thread is the end of my FX journey and I'll be able to contribute something to it.  
  
I'll continue posting two live trades.   
  
See you!  
  
Daniel

This was a trade I took on GBPCAD H1 this morning.  
I entered right after the shooting star and moved my SL to BE after the trade was 20 pips in profit. I wanted to reduce the risk as fast as possible (I realized a possible resistance at 1,5950 after I entered the trade giving me a relatively bad risk reward ratio of about 1:1). I finally got stopped out at BE. At the moment the trade would have been in profit...but at least I didn't make any loss...

I took this trade on AUDUSD M30 (entrance after the hammer). SL at BE after the trade was 40 pips in profit. Looks quite promising at the moment...  
  
Edit: TP reached at 0.9759

Hey Daniel,  
  
nice to meet you !  
  
The more traders we have posting charts in this thread the better we can improve this strategy.  
  
Hope you are ok,  
  
take care and never hesitate to ask questions.  
  
Liebe Grüße aus Stuttgart,

always good to move stop to be as soon as possible, thing is that you should adapt this line to the timeframe you are trading.... so 20 pips in profit for a h4 trade is pretty little, but aint for a M5 timeframe etc.

Hi Jonas!  
  
I appreciate a lot your valuable comments - thank you! Actually one of my first questions would have been how you manage your trades. From what you have written it seems   
  
\- you set your SL to BE as soon as possible (according to the timeframe - thank you for this comment; indeed I often forget to have a look at the timeframe even if I read a lot about it at FF (average daily range,...); in this case I just didn't feel comfortable with the trade because of the low r:r (which r:r are you at least looking for when entering a trade?)).  
  
\- you let some of your profits run (I'll incorporate this in my trading. By reading the thread building an equity millipede I became aware of the power of participation; until which levels do you let your trades run?)  
  
I'll try to post the charts the way you suggested. Today I'll just post one trade as I have a lot to do and can't spend much time with trading.

I entred this trade this morning after the first red candle you can see after the move up (NZDUSD 15 Min). SL: 0.7905; TP1: 0.7814; TP2: 0.7780; TP3:0.7687  
  
SL will be set to BE when trade is 30-40 pips in profit (if it will be profitable...)  
  
Have an excellent day every one!  
  
Daniel

r:r at least 1." for swing trades because i only trade the very major supply/demand levels ,means i expect a turn of pa in at least 9 of 10 cases and i expect to set stops to be in at least 9/10 trades as well.  
  
i let small partials run until next supply/demand levels to bank the rest.  
  
chart looks better now,but we cannot see what is on the left side of your charts, so just zoom out and post em in zoomed out mode next time that we have a overlook of your chart.  
  
kindest regards

Thanks for your explanations, Jonas. This weekend I'll go through the whole thread in order to learn more about your system and to avoid posting redundant questions.   
  
Todays trade hit SL. I'll work on my "charting skills" until the next trade...  
I'm a little bit busy today. So I'll continue trading and posting on thursday.  
  
I wish you all many green pips!

Hey bullzeye!  
  
Thanks for your welcoming words! I guess it will be the same with me. As I don't have much time at the moment I'll start focusing on higher timeframes...  
  
Have a nice day!

I just took a trade in NZDUSD H4. SL:0,75700; TP1:78100; TP2:0.78800; TP3:0.79250  
I find the risk reward ration quite attractive...hope this will work out! Only thing I'm sceptical about is that the area isn't supported by the daily chart. What do you think?

GBPCAD is another pair I'm observing closely at the moment. As soon as there will be a clear sign of reversal on the H4 this could be an interesting opportunity...Any comments?

Thanks for your comment :-)! What are the clear signs of reversal you're usullay looking at?  
  
Indeed the trade didn't develop as I expected it to until now. Closed two of the positions at BE. I'll let the third run because I still think that the risk reward ratio is not that bad...

imho there are 3 solid ones  
  
1\. Dojis forming at supply/demand areas,  
2\. Engulfments   
3\. bearish and bullish outside engulfing bars

absolutely nice spot for shorts, anyway this last 950 pip upmove was pretty fast and solid.... if it breaks the roof i will buy a retest for previos supply level.   
  
all in all area should be good for some shorts trying to move sl to be asap.

Sam Seiden's supply and demand levels look very differently from our's and they have a much higher rate of success based on his deductive reasoning. If a level has been tested already it should not be taken in consideration a second time.

I am really sorry that I've taken that trade before looking at the monthly chart, we have a very obviousy supply level that has been tested and if we would have taken that one we would have gotten 1000 pips off from it. Now that monthly supply level is already tested and september's monthly bar closed inside the supply area. I dont know what to say but according to what Sam said, never take a level that has already been tested and always look to protect your trade on higher timeframe levels for supply and demand. I've failed to do those last 2 very important things and Ill loose alot of money on that mistake

The first three tests are monthly bars in the process of creating a supply level, #4 test is the only valid one because it respects higher TF supply level and it is the first one that has ever touched it..   
  
the big picture i'm reffering to:

While I can see the logic behind it (#4 being the first test/touch ) I'm still wondering what makes you think 5 is a reall risky one. Previous test, (from#4) deffinetly show that there is a clear strength rejection from that supply area / no signs of supply draining out from that level.  
  
A fast approach of #5 only makes me think it will departure fast from that level as well, with a bunch of long traders trapped.   
  
I would consider it risky when price is consolidating some more around that supply area first. But that's my way of working here..

You are right about it. It bounced right off and you could say wow this is really strong, I should take it!   
We cannot rely on variable trading conditions such as deductive reasoning and creativity inside a chart because there is no such thing. When you find something that follows a alghoritmic pattern and it gives out good signals you wouldn't want to twist that strategy up and down and say this signal is completely reliable because it looks so.  
  
According to simple logic we would say that the level has been already tested out (willing sellers sold the pair at that level and they've done their selling, they've got nothing else to sell).

Thanks for the answer! I had little time to read this weeken. I'm at page 40 now and will continuing reading in the evenings...until now it's really interesting to see how the system developed. I already learnt a lot.  
  
Me too I just took the GBPCAD trade now. 4h chart looks pretty good in my opinion.  
  
SL: 1,6420; TP1:1,5935; TP2:1,5800; TP3: 1,5600 - what a r:r ratio!  
  
Nevertheless I'll move SL to BE as soon as possible as I still see a resistence at 1,62400...

For me it's still in the area which was drawn in the attachment of post 1529.  
  
Next one could be around 0.7500 (see H4 chart, end of march 2011).  
  
What do you think?

I'm sorry for the polemic we had last night, I think I was nervous about the trade an my ego overreacted as I didn't have anyone to blame for the bad decision I made but myself.

Look at the hourly gbp cad chart, I missed a demand level that clearly denied the fall. Would have been a good opportunity but close to a higher timeframe supply would be considered risky. Can't post any chart atm because I'm on my phone but it's clearly present inside the chart. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

-between the two s&d levels we have a 330 pip channel out of which 93 have already been rallied so we have a movement towards the next level of 28% with 72% left to be rallied

-cad index s&d levels distance is 200 and the current rally is 80 pips which is a 40% potential move exhaustion being left with 60% more

-gbp index demand level is very far away but we based our trade upon a 4h supply level that has formed inside a daily bar so we should be looking for a demand level on a 4h chart to be fair

*so by looking into the 4h chart we can observe different demand areas that have already been tested but should not be ruled out as the test was pretty violent and a deny in the decline of value was unable to be achieved

Me too I set SL to BE. In my opinion a first target in H4 could be around 1,5930. In the longrun I''ve 1,5600 on my screen...What do you think?

Don't get me wrong.. please I just said it's just riskier to sell or buy into an already tested demand or supply level. I've never said it shouldn't be taken in consideration but if taken you should consider the risks and the possible existence of real sellers or buyers at that certain level, just my two cents ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1). I usually rule them out of there wasn't a clear rejection from that level.

well done refreshg![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
but i think your TP on a H4 timeframe is just too small. When you used a 45 Pips TP, normally you should set your SL to 20-25 and thats too small for H4 trading:nerd:

yes indeed.   
just try to pick a price as good low as possible in demand areas to get awesome r:r's ...we usually see always a reaction at major demand/supply levels.

if we close below the green marked demand we are good for a run to 1.5000 level next week.  
  
sell high, get good entries to have small stops and good r:r's,

Think about not setting a take profit for a position that you take inside 1m, with big lots that is found inside another bigger timeframe s&d level, if you see the rejection is clear and it's heading to take an eventual take profit for the higher timeframe you could profit out of it big time. Set a small stop loss and BE asap. I had some very strong trades this way

next level is 1.3412 or 1.3411, target should be 10 pips because original demand level is 15m

Due to CAD news, my trade AUD/CAD trade is already running in 40pips profit and continuing with 20pips trails. Somehow due to this set up in this thread I am able to keep proper stop loss, and able to decide on the entry.  
  
Thanks everyone for such a accurate chart set up.

always adapt stops and targets to the timeframe being traded.  
  
first of all we search for supply and demand areas, then we wait for price reaching those areas and we try to trade setup if rsx confirms

will this be a good set up for short? Or some more time is needed for overbought condition?

we had massive demand at the 1.000 area, stops would've been below previous low.  
  
  
1.0000 nice support ofc.

It's soooo fuckin rainy and cold outside that im gonna post some stuff about my trading.  
  
How i trade? How i search for possible setups? Why i dont take setup A but take B instead? etc....  
  
first of all i will show you how i start to analyze pair-X. In the following example i will take AUDCAD.  
  
Seriously we need about 1000 pips a month to make a living out of this business.... in my humble opinion. Sure there might be others that need 100 pips a month .... should be ok,if you trade 100 standard lots and more ;-p ....  
  
1000 pips x 1.0 standard lot = ~ 10 000 units - taxes - charges/fees = pretty ok i guess ?! isnt it? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
So thanks to god, Chuck Norris or anyone else who created this wide spread of pairs, we can choose the most volatile, comfortable and easiest pairs/setups.  
  
Why stick to EURUSD if there's no real setup ? Why dont just switch to GBPJPY if price reaches a major demand level there to buy some units ?  
  
I dont get it why most traders say s.th like :,, I only trade EURUSD, GBPUSD and EURJPY'' etc..... ok there might be fundamental reasons, but if you dont scalp the M1 or M5 you do have enough time to screen at least 30 pairs.  
Me personally only trade the H4,daily and weekly timeframe.  
  
Swingers > Scalpers ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
I search for the very major setups to get comfortable trading situations and solid and steady profits.  
Sure there are days i dont have at least one trade, but there are weeks i have 7-8 trades earning 200-250 pips on average.  
  
Alright, lets go back to AUDCAD.  
  
First of all i open a weekly timeframe of AUDCAD,

what do we see? price reacted to the previous high circled on the left, there were 3 possible ( A turn, B turn and C turn ) sell opportunities at this peak. ( ill go into detail later on the daily and h4 timeframe.)  
  
Price dropped in the past at this level, means sellers exceeded buyers and pa reversed, so we expect that this gonna happen in the future again. At such points we get giga r:r ratios.   
  
Now we got our level where we want to sell by watching the weekly timeframe, so we switch to the daily timeframe to go more into detail,search for more supply/demand levels and possible confirmation patterns of a reversal like a Bearish engulfing outside bar, bearish engulfment or dojis.  
  
i marked the A turn, B turn and C turn levels from the weekly chart with an A, B, and C on the daily. Note : it's the same setup,just a different timeframe and zoom level.

Size: 142 KB](/attachment/image/802746/thumbnail?d=1365721041)](/attachment/image/802746?d=1318077729)   

  
  
at point A price kissed the previous top close to the pip at 1.0555 (compare it with the weekly level line above ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1) .... easy sell at this point because price usually doesnt break such a previous major turning point at the first retest.   
We sell, set stop to be as soon as possible,bank a 1/3 and let the other 2/3 run for another 150-200 pips.  
B and C turned earlier, showing us that theres no pressure to the upside left. Price made two LHs on the daily as well. So we try to pick a nice price as close as possible to the previous turning point at A and set stops above the previous high.  
  
1.0200 is possible target level, go along the line and check previous action at this level, price turned pretty often. i circled some of them for you.  
  
Now ill show you the single turns in detail on the H4 timeframe.  
  
Lets start with A ( note again that this is still the same setup,just another timeframe and zoomlevel, we still sell the 1.0555 level) :

We got a Doji on the H4 at the high and sell the close of this bar with target at the already mentioned 1.0200 level, right circle shows target hit.  
Stop would be above 1.0555 level with a 10-20 pip puffer.  
  
next one is B :  
  
price ranged about 36 hours in between this h4 bar box before it dropped pretty hard and quick towards target lvl.  
Our line wouldve been as follows :   
We see that a range box was forming right below the major supply level at 1.0555, so we sell high in the box to get a good price.  
  
stops again above 1.0555 level. Ill show you the bix in the h1 chart :  
  
small circles possible short entries in the mentioned range right below the 1.0555 level ,

and last but not least setup c :

left box is b range. then we got another box at c with 2 possible shirt entries, bars circled black. right fat circle wouldve been our target again.  
  
so we had 3 trades for approx. 300 pips each. easy trading, easy stop level, safe setups. if price dont reach target we have at least a BE trade in 9/10 cases.  
  
  
Please ask any ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Awesome Dude! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f647-200d-2642-fe0f.png?v=15.1) Thanks for the hard work...I have a couple of questions...  
  
Well the trading the H4 and D1 is honestly very hard for me. I try this for a few times, but dont`t get confident yet whit it. The challenging thing is still the big SL and TP that you have to set for this timeframes. My account is still very small ( i trade micro lots ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61e.png?v=15.1)) and my moneymanagement don`t allow me to set SL bigger than 50-60 Pips. What do you think about that?  
  
Do you use hard SL and TP in your trading or set stops every time over last highs/lows?   
  
Do you use trailingstop in your strategy?  
  
The other thing is holding on a position very long to finally hit the Target...i don't have the best patience yet ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f624.png?v=15.1)...but thats a thing a have to work on me![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61f.png?v=15.1)

>    
>  Well the trading the H4 and D1 is honestly very hard for me. I try this for a few times, but dont`t get confident yet whit it. The challenging thing is still the big SL and TP that you have to set for this timeframes. My account is still very small ( i trade micro lots ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61e.png?v=15.1)) and my moneymanagement don`t allow me to set SL bigger than 50-60 Pips. What do you think about that?

>  Do you use hard SL and TP in your trading or set stops every time over last...
> 
> Ignored

well if you trade a micro account u can use stops bigger than 100 pips of course...just adapt your traded sizes.  
Patience is a key virute of trading, if you dont have any patience u wont earn any cash in this business in the long run.... if you trade the daily chart you might wait 10-14 days to get the expected result of example.... forex is a long investment business if you are a swinger......  
  
i dont use trailing stops....i bank at my predefined levels.  
  
always appreciated, dont stop to ask questions !  
  
kindest regards Jonas

Hey An,  
  
first of all thanks for joining this thread and this way of trading.  
I dont use any volume indicators anymore for my trading, but ill upload the indie and an additional ebook for you.  
  
This systems works best on the higher timeframes, but M30 and H1 are still ok for it, please dont go lower though.  
  
Please post your charts and trade setups that we can discuss them here and improve your trading.  
  
Kindest regards  
Jonas  
  
Ps: And yes, patience is the key. Dont expect a 250 pip gain on a daily timeframe trade within 1 day, this might take a couple of days etc...we are swingers,not scalpers ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

i got a couple of requests via mail how i search for trickie and key levels, note: Not supply or demand levels, i mean trickie levels that might cap price for a while or might be useful to place targets.  
  
Well if we open a chart we see hundreds of coloured candles, rangebars that show us traded price range in a predefined timespan (like M1,M5 etc.).

So problem is that we dont find the very significant levels in this candle jungle quiet often, so we switch to a line chart.  
A line chart shows us the connection of all closing prices of the candles.

remember: always go to the next higher timeframe to search for the turning points,for supply and demand areas etc...   
  
example: if you trade the h4 timeframe go to the daily to search for your levels/areas.

mhhhh....Phanti as you always say we have to wait for a clear reversal sign before we entered a trade. I dont see anything like this in H1, H4 and D1 ...of course it could be a positive trade at the end, but why going risky ...you remember: patience is everything (rather a safe trade, as a early trade![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

I was following that rule before and I've let many potential 200-300 pips trades go into b/e. I've come across the idea of taking some losses according to the strategy that I'm following but keeping a good r:r ratio of above 1:2 so I can start hunting for those big trades that pay off. What do you think?

nice trade, but please post your reasons for entering this trade.  
  
What made you enter at this level? where and why was your stop? and your target?   
  
This wouldve been my line , but i missed it because i just went back home several minutes ago ;-p ...

Hi bullzeye,  
  
Perfect trades, you are very patient also. Just one question, the blue lines are manually drawn or it is some indicator?

Do you first confirm the trades on Daily and then take entries on 1H? I mean how do you confirm the entry?

Hey ls007!  
  
Great to have you here in the thread.  
  
The blue areas are Supply/Demand zones drawing by me manually on H4 Chart.

Exactly AbhijetPandi,  
  
first i mark the supply/demand areas in the H4/D1 Charts, then switch in lower timeframes like H1 or m15. If i find the supply/demand areas in H1 overlapping with the higher timeframes, well this is just great...I look for overbought/oversold situation in rsx here and make my entry.  
  
The safer way to make entrys is to wait for reversal sings like doji, hammer or engulfing patterns.

very important.  
You are on the right track...  
  
imho its the better line to blow up an account using indicators and then start to remove them instead of start trading with out any...  
  
so you did have the experience....  
  
thats my opinion ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

100 fundamental move.... anyway we always wait for confirmation at supply/demand levels for a possible turn.  
  
Thats the line.

Hi Phanti, and all,  
  
I've been out for quite a few months and before I left trading, I was using the original system with the indicators. Now that I'm back I see the thread system has changed a bit and was wondering if there is a pdf or txt file to walk through the new system from setup to exit? I checked the attachments, but don't think i saw one, but i may have just missed it.  
  
I see all the positive trades being posted and hope to jump back in with some good trades of my own.  
  
thanks and happy trading ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Hey bro,  
  
nice to hear.  
Well yes, we removed some indicators.  
  
All you need for this strategy is a firm knowledge about trading supply and demand levels.  
  
There you go :
