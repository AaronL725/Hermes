Gap trading exist for a long time already. For forex, it can only take signal from friday close and sunday open thus very less trade.  
  
I have come up with a EA. A very simple one. I believe improvements can be made for a sharper entry.  
  
Pls improve together.  
  
Test the EA with Daily TF  
  
25/12/2009  
Amended some of the codes.  
  
23/02/2011  
Redesign the EA according to the inputs from threads contributions

Hi Doshur,  
I've downloaded your gap trading robot and will demo it. I am interested in finding a way of strategy testing various SL & TP levels with gap trading to find the best cmbination of lowest drawdown and highest profit (Holy Grail eh!) - do you know how I could do this, or find a program that would also let me back test my own strategies?  
  
Many thanks,.  
  
Mike

Hi Doshur,  
I tested your V4 but it did absolutely nothing! Data on the screen kept telling me the gap was too small (too small compared to what?)  
  
No matter how I altered the parameters, still nothing happened. Is it maybe not recognising Fridays or Sundays?   
  
Cheers,  
  
  
Mike  
  
  
PS I wanted to use your EA for strategy testing and put on manual trades.

i think this is actually a good idea, however can anyone take a fresh look at creating a Manual EA for this concept.  
a EA which will state entries and conservative exits.   
i can stand auto trading its just WRONG in my opinion, or perhaps that opinion has just been scolded into my head from being burn from all the hype robot vendors...  
  
Any takers? 

if i used every commercial EA i would be a brazilianare by next week!!!!

There are no gaps in forex, gap trading is a myth. The only gaps that show on charts are gaps in data with regards to your broker.

Hi Choco,  
  
I have traded the GBPUSD & USDCHF weekend gap quite successfully, with a TP of 40 & SL 60 pips. It's all to do with statistics. I keep a log of trades and will post it, if you like.  
When the gap is down, buy; when the gap is up, sell.  
  
Cheers,  
  
  
Mike

Hello doshur,

Yeah Blott go for gold Captain!  
  
i too see the weekend gaps and how often it comes back to close the gap. it really is crazy how often the market rejects the gaps, and closes them in a very short time frame...  
  
the only problem i have with this trade set up is that is comes at 5am where i am, and dragging my tired a$$ out of bed at this time on a monday morning is just too hard to focus on the charts!.  
  
hence the bump on this thread, i would love to wake up on monday morning with 50 or potentially more pips in my pj's.....  
  
so a automated EA might be somthing the FF EA creating community may consider in the future, if it doent pose to much burden.....  
  
but Merry christmas Y'all, get some rest from the charts! 

if i used every commercial EA i would be a brazilianare by next week!!!!

yes, even the "gap" from the weekends. That only happens due to your broker. Forex is traded 24/7 and most brokers are only open 24/5.   
  
I always found it funny when people talk about how it "has to close the gap" then they point to price "closing the gap" 4-5 or more days later. Heck there was a "gap" that occurred on October 5, 2008(EURJPY) that still hasn't been closed. How long should I wait??

well i learnt is Actually open 24/7 out of this thread. but no matter  
if the weekend is still being traded by a small pool of traders, it still leaves me thinking that when all the rest of the traders get on thier stations on monday morning, it's still minor gap, so the larger volume of traders and capitol being traded would tell me its actually a gap, even if it diluted from the week end traded some...  
  
i still have some interest in this subject..... not to discount anyones opinion at all, i just choose to investigate all avenues of this train of thought before i dismiss it...... 

if i used every commercial EA i would be a brazilianare by next week!!!!

GAP trading can be very profitable whether magnumfreak believe it or not.   
  
Whether its the market, the broker or whatever the reason might be i don't care. The Gap is there in every currency pairs every sunday evening(sometimes small gaps sometimes huge gap up to 70 pips). 

Blindly following others will make you blind!

I like trading gaps as well. As for making an EA though I think there may be to many variables. For instance 1 time this past year it too almost a full week for 1 to fill. A good example of one is attached.  
  
This one climbed to "00" for it to reverse. Promptly filled then went north again.

While out with my horse ( He's great for discussing the Fx market with) we were thinking about my last post here.  
  
In short, after a gap is formed it usually needs to run into S/R for it to turn back and fill. Be it a trendline, "00", pivot, etc. So an EA to catch this would be tough. In less of course your EA was Eye Awareness. Sorry couldn't resist. I love working gaps for their pips. The problem I often run into is not being busy with something else when they form.

all righty!!  
  
i was just talking about a EA that coult identify the difference between the period and just open the position, and profit target comes say 5 or so pips to the previous close.  
  
ok ok this trade only comes once a week but how may potential pairs are there?   
............... all the pairs you choose to trade.  
  
this image still delivered 40 pips even if its only coming close the previous close, good good.i will drag my butt outta bed for this set up and give it a good chance. 

if i used every commercial EA i would be a brazilianare by next week!!!!

Hi All,  
Hope your festivities were stress-free and you're still speaking with your nearest n dearest!  
  
Before anyone jumps into gap trading, I would suggest they research this method thoroughly and obtain data as follows:- draw vertical lines on every Monday bar on a daily GBPUSD chart, for as far back as you care to go and note which way the gap goes from Friday close. If it gaps down 'pretend' to buy, if it gaps up, 'pretend' to sell. Sometimes the gap is only 1 or 2 pips and you may have to expand your view down to a M15 chart.   
  
With the crosshair tool, look to see how many pips you can get as soon as the bar opens, before you get stopped out; allow for spread.  
You could try TP=20-40 & SL either 100 or 60, depending on risk level/choice. Often the gain is in the 100's.  
Write the results down so you get a statistical result. Often the gap is "closed" within one or two H1 bars, but can be longer, depending on what the market is doing. You will get losing trades but I haven't come across two consecutive losing trades yet.  
  
USDCHF is also another good currency, due to its large movements. Other pairs will need to be researched separately as they move differently to GBPUSD/USDCHF.   
  
An EA would need to be back & forward tested, with TP, SL & TS variables. The size of gap is not relevant to the size of profit/loss; I have seen many cases where the gap is only 1 pip or less and the gain has been quite large and other times where the gap has been huge and the trade has lost.  
  
  
Regards,  
  
  
  
Mike

I have recently (2months) been using the gaps to grow my account... And every gap trade I have placed has been a winner.  
  
That is not to say on one or two occasions... the gap may not fill... the risk is always there... Surely as long as there is the mindframe and strategy from traders globally that gaps fill, this will indeed make the gaps fill.

Hi Mike and AcedUp!  
  
Could you please your information in regards to how your trading the gap (maybe with a screenshot)? TIA!  
  
Are you using pending orders? If so, how are you setting them (# of pips from low/high price)?

I dont use pending orders, I will wait about 10mins after market open then place my first set of lots... this gives tolerance for drawdown. I will place my final set of lots as she accelerates to fill. **(SEE THE YELLOW LINES)**  
  
I place a limit order of about 5pips from gapfill. **(SEE THE RED LINE)**

To make a pretty penny you need to use up the risk a bit... I have attached my (massive) account balance with some notes.

Hi Ace  
  
Thanks for the informative post. I like gaps as well. Trouble is at times I am to busy on Sunday afternoon to work them properly. I think I will be able to look for some tomorrow.

Hi,  
If the Monday price gaps down - BUY  
" up - SELL  
  
Execute market order as soon as market opens.  
Gap size not relevant, only direction dictates buy or sell.  
I use GBPUSD & USDCHF. Other pairs will need different settings or may not be suitable.  
  
TP=40  
SL=65 (or depending on your risk appetite)  
  
You may choose to use a TS, if you wish.  
  
Cheers,  
  
Mike  
  
  
PS Check back through old data, manually placing a vertical line on every Monday on Daily chart. With your crosshair tool, see how many pips you can make, in the relevant direction (see above), before you get stopped out. If you write your results down, you will see that it wins more often than loses and hasn't yet (since Jan 2009) had two consecutive losses on those two pairs, but please correct me on that if you find such an instance.

I would sugguest waiting 9 or 10 minutes though... it is likely to hold at current price at which you can enter.... or the price will drawdown/up enabling you to enter at a better price.   
  
I agree with the TP.... although I am not brave enough to hold until such.   
  
:o)  
  
Good luck!

you might find this interesting. I went over the last years sunday gaps. Attached is excel file. It appears that a SL of 20 and a TP of 80% of the gap might be sucessful

nice Acedup!  
  
thanks Nickmead!  
  
it's simple, and something to consider as a another bullet in my trading tool kit.  
  
altough we know we can succeed with just this small amout of pips per week on 1 pair, but over your prefered pairs NIIIIIIIIIIIICE!!!!!!!!  
  
eurusd, gbpjpy, gbpusd, eurjpy, usdjpy, audusd, and the audjpy are the pairs i am looking at for this, but dang it gunna have to be a fast moving to capture all the trades if the all confirm at once!  
  
acedup your only trading the 2 pairs?  
  
think we will see some gap tomorrow seen as the Bernanke rock star is got something to tell us in 6 hours or so........ (well before the market opens)  
  
pips to y'all! 

if i used every commercial EA i would be a brazilianare by next week!!!!

Great job bro! I believe one can improve their results entering on stop orders. Time frame as well might deserve some research.  
  
Thanks and manu pips in 2010 !

Hi Acedup,  
It is often this very retracement that provides the 40 pips! If I wait too long i miss my 40 pips. Sometimes there is no retracement and it plunges away in the wrong direction, but that's life! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
I used to use SL=100 but that was too eye-watering when it went wrong!  
  
Regarding TP, just hang in there. You are nearly always guaranteed 40 pips or so. Just don't look at the screen until the trade closes!  
  
Regards,  
  
  
Mike

Cheers Nick for that data, I have been searching for that type of info all weekend.   
  
I find that the GBP/USD alongside GBP/JPY are the best ones for gaps.  
  
Thanks Mike for your input too. Given me some confidence for tonight and my `peeping through my fingers trading' lol

I haven't been back as far as Acedup, but here are my findings.  
  
Let's hope this Monday isn't a losing one!

Hi Mike  
  
Thanks for that info  
  
The SL, where you have displayed the RED 100s etc... are these stops that were triggered?

Yes, but later I was more accurate and gave the actual SL. It's main use is to show the number of profitable trades compared to losing ones. You will notice that GBPUSD & USDCHF have the highest rate of success.   
  
I'm sure anyone could have made a much better record of trades than I did!   
  
There is a EA strategy builder from [www.forexgenerator.com](http://www.forexgenerator.com)  
which I used to build a gap trading EA. I think it's their Beta version and informs me it will expire within 10 days. Their support is quite helpful and quick to reply.  
  
I told it to trade only Monday and:-  
IF previous bar close > Monday open THEN buy.  
IF previous bar close < Monday open THEN sell.  
  
You can also set TS, if you wish.  
  
  
Cheers,  
  
  
Mike  
  
  
PS Did you check to see how many pips you could get consistently over previous months? Quite often much more than 40 pips available.

I will be taking a more in depth look this week plus with all the helpful info that has been posted on this thread. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
As for the moment... some juicy gaps in GBP/USD and GBP/JPY

Mike,  
  
It looks like this part would've been good today for about 30 pips on G/U, G/J and U/F today :-)  
  
**If the Monday price gaps:  
down - BUY  
up - SELL**

The GU gapped about 60 pips this week. I entered at 1.6114, I had my TP set at 1.6177. I had a trade management ea open on a different chart and it closed me at +21 pips, the pair did retrace about twice that but the gap did not close. So with a 15 pip SL this was a successful trade. The EU only Gapped about 20 and it closed to quickly for me.  
  
I should finish with the GU back-testing tomorrow and will post the XLS. Then on to the USDCHF. Its really nice that some people are really making an effort to figure a system out here. Thanks to you all for your time and expertise  
  
cheers

I took the one on the GJ and enjoyed my first trade for 2010: a loss of 50 pipis that were my stop. Looks like the majors didn't fill neither. Still some training ahead.

Hi All,  
I don't just aim tp close the gap; price often goes much further than the gap. Sometimes small gaps result in huge movements and vice versa.  
Anyone else get 40 pips this morning GBPUSD? Price just scraped my SL of 60 and went up. As I was up and about, I manually moved my SL to break even, then reached profit target of 40 pips. Price went on for another 80 pips, but I had to go out.   
  
It's all about statistics - it wins more often than loses (with GBPUSD/USDCHF at least). The riskier times can be when the gap goes in the same direction as the trend, so you may wish to aim for a smaller profit and use a smaller SL or not trade, or trade with the gap.  
  
Suck it and see!  
  
  
Cheers,  
  
  
Mike

Hi Mike! It looks so simple when you present it but I miserably failed at it last night (Europe time), for my first attempt. I believe you got some rules that can help me improve for next sunday.  
Thanks in advance and a pipful year to you!

Possibly what is at fault is confidence? If I try a new system and strategy where I am not confident I usually freak out and lose... I sugguest you watch the gaps over the coming weeks and watch how they act... then go for a live trade or two.  
  
Ive been developing a strategy and it works because I have the confidence to carry it through... and I am aware of the risks involved.  
  
as Mike says, the gap can go further than fill... but I have been developing my strategy and targets at before gap fill... I wont try to go further until I am 100% confident.   
  
Good luck what ever you decide to do!

I don't know who wrote this, but both the GBP/USD and the USD/CHF hit profit using a 65 SL and a 40 TP.

Hi Muntu,  
Don't worry at failing; simply try again until you get the hang of it.  
Just start with GBPUSD at first.  
  
I can't guarantee what the market will do. If there is no gap, like yesterday on USDCHF, I just stayed out.  
  
You may wish to experiment with your own TP/SL levels, but I use TP=40 SL=68.  
  
Cheers,  
  
  
Mike

Hi Ace!  
Sure, I was not too confident, since it wasn't my regular way of trading. I wonder if my stop was not too large as well, but that was my usual way of setting it.  
I would like to hear more about your strategy, if you don't mind.  
Good day!

Hi guys  
  
Ive been working on back dating GBP/USD gaps and looking at their fill ability with drawdown. Now, ive kept the data at **two hours** as I personally will only be able to take two hours and my target pipage is 20pips.  
  
**9 out of 12 of them filled** or reached my target of 20pips without heavy drawdown  
  
**10 out of 12 of them filled** or reached my target 20pips with 1 heavy drawdown.  
  
have a look at the spreadsheet Ive completed with charts.  
  
The data I was using I downloaded from:  
  
<http://ratedata.gaincapital.com/>  
  
The times on the Sun OPEN and Fri CLOSE are as at NY time (GMT -5) incase you find yourself scratching your head. I used the Ask price, did not discriminate against whether it was a buy or sell as far as using the BID or ASK... this is purely for display purposes and may lack a few pips here and there. **The Red on the charts are the GAPs**!  
  
I will go through some more of my fave CCYs this week now that im on a roll ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
All in all.. my sentiment is that with the right risk management and depending if you are in for a gamble... you can make alot of money on these.  
  
Good Luck  
  
  
**muntu ntu** \- I will share my strategy once Im rolling and have worked out my risks properly... Sorting out this data has made me look deeper and more seriously about the risk I am involving with my account.

Hi Acedup,  
I'd like to look at the data you kindly posted but whenever I try to open the two XL files my XL program shuts down. I can view other .xls files I have, but not yours. Is there a way around this? I have a 2000 version of Excel.  
  
  
Cheers,

Hi Muntu  
  
They are a more of a visual representation of the gaps... and how they are filled. They benefit me because they have given me odds of the fill, and how they get there... I can work out a proper risk management strategy now.  
  
The red line is the gap.

Through trading gaps I saved my doomed £550 account from £180 to £1318 over 2.5months.  
  
Though that was high risk, and Im rethinking my strategy a little

Hi Acedup,  
Thanks for those two other zipped files but the same keeps happening with me too - XL crashes.

Hi Acedup,  
  
Many thanks for the pdfs. Very clear except for the GBPUSD - di it gap up or down? I can't quite make it out. According to my Alpari UK chart it gapped down then went up 100 pips. Was that the same as yours?  
  
I admire your tenacity in trying to salvage what must have seemed like a doomed account, but what other option is there? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f64f.png?v=15.1)   
  
The thought at the back of my mind is that there have been a lot of consecutive winning runs and, as the Irish say "The longer you live, the sooner you're going to die"! What the heck, it's only money!  
  
Have a good weekend everyone,  
  
  
Cheers,  
  
Mike

They are clearer to me with the PDF.  
Am I right to observe that the GJ is not the best of the class, and the UJ perfoms the best.?

Hi,  
And there are some people who say there is nothing in this 'gap trading idea'! It's the strong salmon that swims against the current! Keep it up.

Hi TRJ!  
  
How are you trading the dragon gap? Are you using a trailing stop? What is your TP and SL? TIA!

tomorrows open may be a big gap i think coz of the non farm news on late friday, i got rolled on 2 trades on this announcement, so if i see a huge opportunity this weeks opening i will be conservative on my positions, i'm not sure if the USD will try to contiune a bull run, with all the job losses in december, (much more than expected) so matbe only NON USD pairs i will look at more favourbly is my approtch at this moment.....  
  
my positions SL and TP are close to 1:1 ratio, i just make sure i take profit 5 pips before the friday close price. 

if i used every commercial EA i would be a brazilianare by next week!!!!

Yeah gday all ,the best way for me is ,i always open 3 trades to average a good entry point ,i map larger TF for SR lines ,then i have a indi there that performs my trend,i wait for it to turn then place the trade to fill the gap.sometimes i place a stop at the gap coz its the start of a new weekly candle pends on SR and let it ride with a trialing stop...and nother thing with gap on open is the time fACTOR usually takes any longer than 1 hour to fill i close the trade i pay 13 pip [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") of late ,but USD/JPY is only bout 3 but not much of a gap 40 the most by memory ,normaly bout 15-20, dragon is the one that leaps more imo.. i nurse the trade ,i set large stop incase off power failure or computer/internet buggers up, i trade full time and i just discussing that its a efficient trade with very low risk something that FX doesnt have in normal conditions..will post tommorows open i reckon with high liquidity and NFP we in for a ripper least 80 odd bankable pips..but time will tell....

Hi TR,   
Good post, though I need some more light:  
So, waiting for an indi to show reversal might be a good signal to take the trade.  
Do you mean you open trades on three pairs at the same time?  
What is your higher time frame, and btw, your working time frame?  
Does the actual long term trend matter?

muntu ntu do you have a problem with execution?  
are you trading to larger lots?  
  
we are trying out this strategy coz its looks VERY consistant, and from experience and some beck testing you can see the result also.   
  
perhaps try to execute the trades as you see them, we all get stopped out this much you can be certain of, but it's how we manage our profits that permits us to be successful traders.  
have a go captain perhaps you have a unique perspective on it. which may turn out to be the best for you...

Hi everyone  
  
Something I would like to contribute... and I'll start by saying that although there are no actual gaps I agree that there may be something in it simply because lots of people trade it.  
  
If you want to see the price action that occurred during the "gap" get yourself a demo account with [Oanda](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile"), and I think someone else pointed out the web page with live quotes. I have attached a chart (hopefully it works) on which the vertical yellow line represents the start of trading with my USA based MT4 broker. This is actually 12pm on Monday in New Zealand where I am. You can see things actually kicked off at 7am. New Zealand Daylight Time (NZDT) is currently GMT+13 with daylight savings in place at the moment. The only reason it is Sunday in the USA is because the rest of the world is so far ahead of you! *runs for cover* LOL.  
  
I hope some of you find this useful. Thanks for this thread it looks promising.

A couple of questions. Do you enter immediately at the start of trading, and what is your stop loss. Do you have a fixed TP of 50 pips.  
  
Thanks, I've just started looking at the Sunday Gap

Don't you pay a large spread for each trade when opening a trade at this hour of the day?  
Most of the brokers widen their [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") at these hours (between 22GMT to 5GMT).

Your SLs work during weekends? I say this because the only time I try to use gap trading SL didn't work and the trade was closed at opening price of Sunday, if the response is yes, in what broker?

i would never try to open a trade over the W/E, seldom do i have a trade left over the weekend.  
  
i dont know what your thoughts are but i can think of why to be honest.

The thing I've noticed about gaps, especially large 100 pip + gaps, is you can pretty much trade the fibo retracements within the gap. .  
  
I've also noticed, that once the price goes about halfway in a gap, if it doesn't plow through and complete the gap, it will be a very long time until it does.   
  
Overall gap trading I find too unpredictable to generate a system off of, it's similar to using psych points, or candle patterns--It's something to know about, but not something to base your livelihood on. I have yet to see anything on this thread which alters my view.

Looking at usd/cad there's a gap showing at the 104.9x level.  
  
It shows on the 15m to h4 time frames but not on the 5m or 1m.  
  
Is this just a quirky bug on mt4, maybe price moved at the close of a candle so fast it didn't have time to register on those time frames or is it considered a valid gap?

I know what you mean, it sometimes does it on my Dealbook360. I always check a few timeframes to make sure.  
  
I dont know why it happens.

getting ready for tomorrow groovers?  
  
i got to thinking about this a wee bit and i could be way out ofline thinking in this direction about this.  
but when people send money internationally, they always get the bid/ask prices at the time of the transaction at the bank.  
(ofcourse its got a wider spread) but seen as friday is still a day the market is open, perhaps most fo the banks international transfers are not yet confirmed, due to arrr the banks not able to profit from the outstanding tranfers, due to actual current price, so i'm thinking that seen as alot of volume is still pending to be finalized, the market reaches the previous close inorder to fill the lots, yeah look i know i'm probly talking about a small amount, but am i? how can we certain of that....  
  
personally when i send money (from bank to bank, NOT a broker) to my home country on a friday i may not get it in my account until tuesday, sometimes on a wednesday  
  
hmmm chocolate pip cookies for breakfast! 

if i used every commercial EA i would be a brazilianare by next week!!!!

Gap scalping has its merits.  
  
Does anyone have a gap indicator which would draw a box in the gap?

edge1 and others, just for clarification,   
  
i am trading gaps intraday on the 1 min tf.   
  
the minimum gap size i look for is about half a pip.  
  
if the price has moved a certain distance away from the gap i become interested and have bias for the gap being filled. the more gaps there are in that direction, the stronger my bias is. on aud thats about 15-20 pips. on gbp its 30-40 pips.  
  
if the price goes against me i add more positions, and am mostly trading without stops.  
  
the indi drawing the arrows is called gap finder. its a bit messy but we'll have to make do for now.  
  
you'll find it here

plasmapants what this thread is about, has nothing to do with what you are trading, you have hijacked this thread for a totally different concept of trading.  
  
perhaps start your own thread with your concepts outlined for other to follow if indeed it suits them....  
  
i just dont see how your 1M TF gaps is relivant to weekend gaps........  
  
no disrespect at all intended, but it is what it is.......

I don't think we need 2 threads about the same thing. In these trades I'm chasing the closing of the gap. Gaps don't just take place at weekends. It's all in the same spirit of things. So stop having kittens. If the thread originator has issues with what I'm posting he can delete my posts. No disrespect intended.

I often trade the Sunday gap....and am experimenting with the EA....but would be real nice is someone could build an indicator to scan all pairs and list the pair and the gap that is greater than X pips.

Hey roundrock...thanks! Very nice....three things:  
  
Could you have it calculate true pips re a 5 digit broker? So EU's gap would be 59.6 and not 596.  
Could you sort from highest gap to lowest gap?  
Could you have it display the gap up in one colume and the gap down in another column?  
  
This will be very useful...we'll further develop a Sunday gap trading strategy with this.  
Cheers  
CanuckCT

You should be trading with the gap, not against it, at least for the longer term.  
just my 2 pees.

hi CanuckCT,  
  
i fixed the 5 digit pip issue. regarding sorting the data by pips , i need to spend more time on that.  
  
meanwhile can we start the strategy ?

If anyone's still following this forum here is the strategy I use to trade weekend gaps. It has been very successful to this point.   
  
Strategy:  
-On the Sunday open if a gap of 13 pips or more is present, buy if there is a gap down and sell if there is a gap up. Buy/Sell at market.  
  
-I define a gap as the difference between the Sunday open and the top or bottom of the Friday's candle body depending on the market direction. Example: for a gap down I measure the distance between the Sunday open and the bottom of the Friday candle body.  
  
-Set profit target to 75% of the gap. Set stop-loss to the same. This creates a risk reward ratio of 1:1. Be sure to compensate for your broker's spread.  
  
-I have found these pairs to be the best performers: USD/JPY, GBP/JPY, EUR/JPY, and EUR/USD.  
  
-Take a maximum of three trades. If four setups occur then drop the GBP/JPY. It has the highest spread of the four.  
  
-This strategy can be spread sensitive so look for a broker with low weekend [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") or fixed spreads. I trade this with fixed spreads.  
  
I have attached a spreadsheet which lays out the trades over the last year. Some days there were four setups present but as stated above the GBP/JPY was omitted. I started with a $15,000 balance and set the risk per trade at 5%. That is on the high side of risk but the system has roughly an 80% win ratio. This is a backtest and not the actual trades taken. Hope this helps.

Excellent strategy Wasp  
  
  
If the trade doesn't reach the T/P in the first day, how long do you leave the trade open throughout the week?

Hey Jack,  
  
Interesting stuff. What broker have you tested this on because there is a huge difference of what broker you are using. The gap is much higher on Alpari UK compare to some other brokers, like IBFX, [FXCM](/brokers/fxcm "View FXCM Broker Profile") and FXDD and more, sometimes the double. 

Blindly following others will make you blind!

Hi Jack,  
  
I looked into Sunday gap trading (sell on gap up & vice versa) some while back but never did anything about it due to not being able to find a decent EA that would carry out that strategy for me, and would also forget to switch on my computer early enough to catch the first tick!  
  
My back testing shows similar percentage wins to yours, though occasionally three or more pairs would hit SL together to produce an eye watering drawdown. Admitedly, my SL was half yours, so that's where the problem may be. I will attach a simple EA I wrote that trades on Daily bars only; see if it's something you or anyone else could refine.  
  
As prices can sometimes move quickly on Monday opening, I think an EA would be very useful to catch maximum pips, but in your strategy that wouldn't matter.  
  
Cheers,  
  
  
Mike

Hi All!   
  
I have spent most of this afternoon going over data from different brokers. I'm far from being done but I have definitely noticed a difference in the results from broker to broker. I ran the backtests on GAIN which performed great. I compared this to my TDFX account and noticed that the results were not quite as good. FXOpen is similar to GAIN on their opening and whatnot from what I can tell. Give me a little time and I'll try to put together some better data for brokers. It seems as if one size doesn't fit all.  
  
fluiDynamic,  
I noticed there was one trade that was open for a couple of days but it did eventually win. Most often though the trades last only a few hours. I have found it best to just let it ride to either a win or loss. Feel free to change TP points to suite your taste. You can't go broke taking profit.   
  
blott (Mike),  
I know how psychologically damaging drawdowns can be. It can create the fear to take even the smallest of trades. The advantages of this system is it has had a fairly high win rate. But, to overcome the mental aspect of three losses on the same day consider reducing your risk percentage per trade. I ran the test with 5% risk per trade. That's high. Find what suits you best. Thanks for the EA. I'll take a look at it.  
  
Looking at my notes there were times that all four pairs triggered but I only took the main three omitting the GBP/JPY due to the spread but had I taken all four I would have fared better. Another possibility would perhaps be to take all four but at say 2% or less per trade. Play with this strategy and take from it what you like best. The only basic rule is that markets tend to fill gaps. By the way as I write this there is a nice gap in the EUR/USD at GAIN.

vukovi,  
The pairs I personally look at and trade for the weekend gap strategy are the EURUSD, USDJPY, GBPJPY, and EURJPY. I have reviewed and studied the performance of the GBPUSD and the EURGBP and found those to not work too well. See post #2645 on Lawgirl's thread for a little more info on that.  
  
[http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...66#post4135266](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=4135266#post4135266)  
  
Also keep in mind that there can be periods of several weeks before a trade will setup.   
  
This is only one way of trading weekend gaps. Be creative. For example experiment with going for a larger TP and or SL, find the risk percentage suitable for your personal trading style, etc.   
  
I have discovered that this strategy doesn't perform the same from broker to broker. It depends on what time the broker opens on Sunday's. For example, GAIN opens at 1600 Central time and FXOpen opens an hour later. They both work well for me. TDFX opens at 1800 and doesn't seem to do as well. My advice would be to open demo accounts at various brokers you may be interested in and see if the strategy works by looking back at previous weekends. Also watch the spreads at brokers.   
  
I hope this helps and look forward to seeing you this weekend!

yes jack you where more than helpfull...i got a good broker,on my demo the gaps are good...talking about eurusd +40 pips this weekend  
  
jack i have a question for you...did you ever tried this..you see the behavior of the eurusd gap this last weekend i was watchin on H15 the direction...new candle opened way down and filled the gap to the top...would it be logic to try and play the gap 2 times,place a sell on the opening candle(it was a gapup) and close it when the big jump happens...but then we still have a gap,is it reasonable to buy know and wait for the new gap to fill again??? do i make any sense??  
  
thanks for your help on gaps,you where more than helpful

vukovi,  
I'm not sure what mean exactly by the second gap. I think what you are implying is to fill the gap then reverse your direction in an attempt to see if the market will pull back. If that is what you mean, that could be very risky. On my charts I don't see the second gap you mentioned. But with all that said, experiment. Maybe you could develop something from this. The basic rule of thumb that I use for this is that markets tend to fill gaps. In all my trading in any market, I am always alert when a gap forms. Markets hate gaps.  
  
Here is an M15 EURUSD chart of last weekend's gap. This is on an FXOpen account. FXOpen opens on Sunday's at 1700 central time.

jack,  
  
yes thats exactly what i thought...i figured out it would be risky to follow the gap filling up in this case...thanks for you help..  
  
can i be free and ask you one more question..in your gap backtest file...later on when you account progresses how can you maintain a 5% winnings when lets say a gap on EURUSD is just 20pips for that week,lets say you total is 3000,so 5% is 1500, how do you get those 5% from just 20pips gap...more lots??? then there is bigger risk,or less room for the gap to breathe before it hopefully closes????  
  
thanks again,please replay to this you can

Hi vukovi,  
Correct me if I'm wrong but I think you're asking about the risk per trade of 5%. If the gap was a smaller one (10-20 pips) you would increase your lot size but never exceed your total risk per trade. For example:  
  
Gap size=20 pips  
75% target=15 pips  
Risk=15 pips  
Reward=15 pips  
Risk per trade=5% (Use whatever risk is appropriate for you. Use 2% if you feel more comfortable with that.)  
Account size=$1,000  
(I didn't take into account the broker's spread for this example)  
  
Now using the above criteria here is how it breaks down:  
  
Risk=$50 (5% of $1,000)  
Lot size=0.33 or $3.30  
  
Now let's say we had a large gap of say 70 pips. Here is the breakdown:  
  
Risk=$50 (5% of $1,000)  
Lot size=0.07 or $0.7  
  
Either way it will be the same profit or loss. The only difference is the lot size is adjusted accordingly. Hope that helps. Let me know if have any more questions.

Hi vukovi,  
On USD pairs one pip will always equal $10 for a standard lot traded. Other pairs will vary. A mini-lot on a USD pair would be $1. Micro lots would be $0.10. Most brokers have micro accounts available but not all.  
  
Leverage deals with how much margin is required to maintain a position. For example at 100:1 margin on a standard lot on the EURUSD is $1405 whereas 200:1 leverage margin would be $702. Here is a link to a great margin / pip value calculator. It is a free download. You have to submit your email if I remember correctly. It is on the Currensys trading system site. Look towards the bottom.

Hi jack,  
  
first of all i am gonna say thanks a lot jack,im sorry if boring you to death,but there is just one thing im not getting,so please if you have time help me,i'll give an example so its easier to explain..  
  
lets say my account is 100 000 so if im gonna risk 5% its 5000,and for the simple math lets say the gap is 100pips,so my target is 75pips(aiming for that 75% of the gap)  
  
Risk=$5000 (5% of $100 000)  
Lot size=6.6 or $66.6  
  
my question is this,i need to enter with 6.6 lots and shoot for those 75pips...but how am i gonna do it when i can only enter with round number of lots...ie 6,7 etc???  
i hope my question had more sense now...  
  
thanks again for your help,i dont wanna be ungrateful,because you helped me a lot

You need to get another broker. You need to be able to trade fractional lots.

Hi vukovi,  
  
First off, you definitely are not boring me to death! I actually enjoy doing this. Now, to answer your question, what broker are you using? Almost every broker I am aware of offers mini and standard lots to be traded in the same account. Some even offer standard, mini, and micro to be traded in the same account. Just be aware that not all brokers work well with the weekend gap strategy. Generally speaking the earlier a broker opens on Sunday's the better.   
  
Now if for whatever reason you are with a broker that only allows you to trade in standard lot sizes, my recommendation would be to always round down on your lot sizes. In your example above of 6.6 lots, I would go with 6. The bottom line is never ever exceed your predetermined risk percentage per trade. And please don't feel you need to risk 5% per trade. It's like I said before, 5% is the high end of risk per trade. If you feel more comfortable go with something smaller like 2%. Most courses on trading recommend no more than 2% risk per trade. There is no holy grail. You will always have loosing trades. It's just the cost of doing business. The idea is to live to trade another day. Let me know if that helps.

hi jack  
  
thanks for your input.  
  
just want to know if you have traded this live yet and what were your results ? trading demo is not the same thing as trading live. you could be up 90% on a demo but when trading live find you are in fact losing ! its a whole new ballgame trading live.  
  
also your r:r of 1:1, is that not very risky ? i.e. a few losses will negate any profits to be made ? and if the stop is just 75% of the gap, and assuming the gap is around 20 pips which is what usually happens on most pairs i.e. the sunday gaps are pretty small, then it is highly likely the SL will be hit within a few minutes of markets opening ?  
  
lastly, can you confirm which broker is GAIN ? Iam based here in the u.k. so iam not sure what time it would be here when the markets open on a sunday in the u.s. ? especially on the GAIN platform. also, what TF do we use to look at the gaps ?  
  
regards

Hi whatfx,  
  
Yes I have traded this strategy live but just started last Sunday. It did win for me. On one of my accounts a setup triggered in the EURUSD which won.   
  
Over the course of the last year in my other trading styles I kept noticing this Sunday gap happening. In the back of my mind that quite voice kept telling me to take a look into it. Perhaps that was from my days of futures trading. But regardless the voice wouldn't shut up. We had a blizzard up here where I live and I took full advantage of that by locking myself in my office for two days to study. I backtested my theory ran the numbers and was amazed. Does this mean that it will continue performing like this? Absolutely not. This strategy could fall flat on it's face from now on but for that matter any strategy could. All I know is that it has done spectacular over the last year and from my initial analysis it seems 2008 was similar. I will be running the backtests on that soon.  
  
Yes going from demo to live is different. There are two types of differences. The first is obvious; slippage, [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide"), etc. The second is not so obvious; emotions. The second is by far the deadliest. The first problem can be dealt with to some degree by finding the appropriate broker for this strategy. The second, well let's just say there are books for this. One thing I have learned is to paper trade until you are tired of being right and not making any money! That will build confidence in your trading plan which will quite your emotions. Emotions and trading don't mix.  
  
I chose a risk to reward ratio of 1:1 because mainly it fits my trading personality. This is partially how I solved the emotions issue. It works for me. I use this ratio in some of my other live trading strategies as well. This risk reward ratio is better suited for something that wins at least 65% of the time. In my opinion, when you go for a risk reward ratio of 2:1 or even higher you can have a series of losses that might not be crippling to your account but they could be crippling to your emotions. Never underestimate your emotions in your trading. I have in the past and it cost me dearly.  
  
As far as the small gap size, my personal strategy for this is I don't like to go after gaps smaller than 13 pips. 13 pips means I would be targeting a 10 pip move. I am testing more of a scalping strategy where one would go after that smaller move. That is still in the works.  
  
GAIN is [Forex.com](/brokers/forexcom "View FOREX.com Broker Profile"). Lucky you being in the UK! You guys don't fall under the ridiculous regulations of the CFTC. A topic for another thread. I was with Forex.com (GAIN) until my account was repatriated to the US. Their Sunday opening is currently 1600 central time which is GMT-5. I am currently using FXOpen for this strategy which opens on Sunday at 1700 central. My best advice would be setup a couple of demo accounts at various brokerages to find which suites you best. This may seem ridiculous but I have at least 10 different demo accounts all from different brokerages. Yes, I have been broker shopping recently.  
  
Sorry about the long post. Hopefully I answered your question. And like I said, stay tuned, I'll be working on more backtests for this strategy. I wanted to have them done for this weekend but I haven't had the time. Take care.

I forgot to answer your question about timeframes. I look at the 30MIN but it doesn't really matter. All you need is the Sunday opening price and the Friday closing or opening price depending upon the direction of the gap. These trades generally seem to last 30 minutes to a couple of hours. There are exceptions. One trade I looked at lasted a day or two if I remember right.

thanks for your response.  
  
i did a quick backtest on my broker platform ''ig index''. on the eur / usd pair. thier friday closing time is 9pm GMT, and sunday opening at 9pm GMT also.  
  
ok. what i found is about 60% of the time, the price gaps over 15 pips. these are the only trades that can be taken into account. so taking these trades for 6 trades in the past i got 3 wins and 3 losses.   
  
maybe if i went back a bit more the results could have been different.  
  
also, maybe if i used a different broker the results could have been different also.  
  
but as it stands at present it is break even for the 6 trades. so my thought at the moment is if this gap trading is worthwhile as after about 2-3 months if one hasn't made any pips then its kind of disheartening. after all we are in forex to make pips !  
  
  
anyway keep us posted on your results/findings. and any new ideas about trading the gap or which is the best broker.  
  
also i forgot to mention i had no joy with the other pairs you listed as on ig index those pairs rarely gap for more than 15 pips.

I'm glad you looked at your own backtest data. I don't want anyone to just blindly trade this with real money without either demo testing or doing their own backtesting on their broker.   
  
The success of this strategy definitely varies from broker to broker. I ran the backtest on a Forex.com account and actually live trade this on an FXOpen account. So far here is a brief list of brokers that this strategy seems to work on:  
  
Forex.com  
FXOpen  
[FXCM](/brokers/fxcm "View FXCM Broker Profile")  
  
I will update this list as I find more brokers that it fits. I am going to build an ongoing spreedsheet detailing the trades taken that I will post here. The criteria seems to be the following:  
  
-Earlier Sunday open times. Something in the area of 2200 GMT is best.  
-Spreads must be fairly normalized during that time period. For example, this disqualifies [Oanda](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile") because they widen their spreads to 10 over the weekends.  
-The broker must pass at least a brief backtest as compared to the original backtest I ran which I will post again below.  
  
Keep in mind that the period of 9/12/10 thru 10/31/10 the system only took four trades, all winners on a Forex.com account.   
  
Also the way I trade it, my minimum gap size is 13 pips which would then shoot for a TP and SL of 10 pips. Be sure to add your broker's spread.  
  
Compare the data I've compiled in the attached spreesheet with your broker. Demo test this first! Do not risk real money if you are not comfortable with this! Find the risk percentage that is suitable for you. Just because the backtest used 5% does not mean you should. There is absolutely nothing wrong with going with 1-2% risk per trade. Be creative with this. If you find something that works better, by all means let us know. In a market that trades $3.2T plus per day I think there is plenty for all of us to go around.  
  
I will be here this afternoon and post as best I can to keep everyone alerted to what I see. Once again here is the link to prices that should give you an idea of what is happening prior to your broker's open:  
  
<http://www.oanda.com/currency/real-time-rates>  
  
Please review the backtest and strategy in the attached spreedsheet and good luck to everyone this evening (or morning)!

I am sure all of you are aware but just as a reminder, the US just went to Daylight Savings time. Keep this in mind for the Sunday open.

EURUSD  
GAP=18   
75%=13.5 (ROUND UP TO 14)  
TP=14 PIPS (+SPREAD)  
SL=14 PIPS (+SPREAD)  
SPREAD=2 PIPS

Here is a setup on the NZDUSD on an FXOpen account that failed. I haven't backtested this pair yet so it was just a test. Spread is 5.

Quick 15 Pips on the EUR. 3 weeks and three winners!  
FYI  
FXOpen has had a 2 Pip spread for all these Monday AM trades!

The trade lost. I'll post more details as time permits. I started to look back another 10 months prior to the original backtest. This will give us an idea of what it has done over the last 22 months. I'll post it when I'm done.

I wouldn't say there aren't any gaps. If you look at M1, you will see a bunch. But, the question is are they worth it or not? And my opinion is probably not. That is because they are too small and the spread will eat up the gains if any.

I finally completed the backtests going back to 11/16/2008. I'll be upfront and honest; they are not pretty. While the previous year had a stellar performance the prior 12 months didn't except for one pair, the USDJPY.  
  
I have attached an updated spreadsheet that shows all the data I compiled. Pay special attention to the 3rd tab showing the USDJPY isolated.  
  
Is this still a viable strategy? Yes and no. It depends on what broker you use and the pairs you trade. I will continue to live trade the USDJPY based on what I've backtested. I view this as a strategy to compliment other strategies in your personal arsenal.   
  
If anyone has any ideas on how to improve this, by all means speak up! Afterall we are essentially on the same team with one goal in mind...to make money. Take care.

Hi Guys,  
  
What we need is a EA where we can set to trade a percentage of the gap.  
  
I find we should only take about 80% of the gap to be successful.  
  
Stop Loss is set to about 30 to 35 pips.  
  
Cheers

Hi Everyone,  
  
Try these EAs. I too think usdjpy is more reliable, or maybe gbpjpy.

jack,  
  
i was afraid that the backtest will show something like that...i agree that this can be effective only like u compliment strategy to some other things..but the way we could make it effective is shooting for as low as we can...i will give you and example...  
  
last week eurusd was bad for the strategy that is aiming for the 75% fill, i had it on demo,with 3000,entered with three lots(this was the only gap worth trading) and got out with 13 pips,thats almost 400 dollars,i know im risking too much,but any gap that has some size to it is bound to fill at least 35,40%...and maybe that should be our goal,its still nice sum when you add it up togather?? what do you think,i thing it could work...  
  
thanks again for all the work you did,i think gaps can be played ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Trading the GAP is great for me I use it every week. best result is from the GBPAUD, USDCHF & EURUSD. The EA I use trades with consideration of the GAP size and short delay to manage spread and the minimum spread. Here's a link to where I got it from [GAP EA](http://www.learnforexfutures.com/auto_trader.htm)

maybe certain pairs,and gap size over 15 i would say,and then playing more gap ups than gap downs..but who knows,i think the main thing is when we go live,to hit good two or three weeks and get the things rolling or else....lol

You might be right but it would be helpful if you had any data to show this.  
  
I've got another data provider that aligns fairly close with [Forex.com](/brokers/forexcom "View FOREX.com Broker Profile")'s prices. I'll use this to look back further and see if anything pan's out. As of right now based on what I've compiled I'm going with the USDJPY. It has worked for the last two years.

I am not sure what "whatfx" is on about??? GAP strategy does work, maybe his/her strategy is not right.   
  
Try GBPAUD it has a great success rate

try this.. 25 pip TP and 40pip SL, GAP must be at least 20pip wide and spread must be less than 10pip. Wait for 15 min after open before you enter ie 22:15 London time. do this on the GBPUSD and GBPAUD

hi  
  
i backtested on 3 pairs gbp/usd, eur/usd and eur/jpy. backtest was for 6 months. i actually got mixed results on all 3 pairs. hardly any pips to be made. so my conclusion was these trades are not worth spending time on. you could easily trade other methods that are more reliable instead of wasting time on gap trading.  
  
then again it could just be that my broker platform is not very good at gapping ?

It could very well be your broker. I ran my two year backtests on Forex.com (GAIN). I actually live trade this with FXOpen. I think [FXCM](/brokers/fxcm "View FXCM Broker Profile") might work but you've got to be careful of the [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide").   
  
I agree with you on the GBPUSD. It pretty much fell flat on it's face over the last two years. The EURJPY did great over the last 12 months but wasn't so hot the year before.  
  
For me personally, this strategy is kind of a "beer money" strategy. The trades usually only last on average a few hours if that. Because of the short duration it usually doesn't interfere with my other trading.  
  
I'll keep updating the spreadsheet every week to give everyone an idea of what is happening. It would be helpful if everyone else could post their results with the broker they are using. Good info would include spreads, pairs looked at, and broker's opening time. I can add all that info into the spreadsheet as well.

Yes I too enjoy trading this system on M1-M5  
is there a EA or indicator that can   
compare last 2 candles  
like a movement of price 5-15 pips  
then the ea buys or sells (in same or opp direction)  
  
  
Yes the gap indicator is good to find   
Friday close sunday open GAP  
but i would like something to monitor   
the gap starting to closing soon after the open

perhaps you can post some results showing your successes ? because with a 25 tp and 40 sl combo you will be in the red. my backtest on gu and ga showed poor results (igindex platform), the time of market open being on a sunday at 9pm gmt.   
  
also, the gap is very rarely more than 20 pips !

I didn't hold Any positions over the weekend, But I can expect a Gap. Unfortunately, I'll be away from the PC and getting some mountain fresh air when the market opens.   
  
What do you mean by trade a % of the Gap with EA? Like if the market gaps 100 pips, you want to trade 25% of the gap in the "fill the Gap" direction? Sounds easy enough. Close - Open = x times .25 = Your TP. and add a filter, if the close/open is less than so many pips, do not enter a position.

Hi !  
  
First, sorry my english made in Google.  
  
JackWasp. In backtesting you did that you are using your account for 4% of 10k which would give $ 400 per trade. I do not understand how you put a 4% profit on the current value of that amount being for this to happen, would have to obtain at least 100 pips gap, which does not always occur.   
  
Could you explain my friend because I do not indenting right to backtest your spreadsheet.

hey guys  
  
It has been an interesting thread to read, as I have been looking for a reliable weekend gap EA for a while now.  
  
There has been some very odd statements made here and there, though. I successfully trade weekend gaps on a regular basis and the only reason I want an EA is I find that at times they can move swiftly and by the time you get it, you can have missed 15 pips or so. I want to be in at market open.  
  
It is also my belief that if you only trade in the direction of the trend, the % increase than when you try to trade countertrend. For me, I look at a 20 day regression channel, but you could use what you wish....long term MA, standard deviation. If the longer term trend is bullish and the candle gaps down on market open, then the long trade is much more likely to be successful. If the long term trend is bullish and the candle gaps up, following the trend, then the countertrend gap trade is much more risky and prone to failure.  
  
If someone had an EA that would allow for a minimum gap size (for me 20, no value if smaller), accurate entry conditions ie if candle open > candle close of last period, enter short at market. The reverse for <  
  
Can set stops and targets if desired and lot size or %. I did like the idea of stop and target being either in pips or % of gap. Ability to handle 5 digit broker.  
  
I am a bit luckier in that market open here is 9am my time, as I am in Australia, so the management of the trade is not so relevant........just the entry. Too hard to monitor a dozen pairs all at entry. For me, that's the part that needs automating. Once in the trade, MyFX Console handles the trade anyway.  
  
I want to be in at market open with a market buy/sell order and I'd like to be able to run it on multiple pairs. I have found no pair any better than another. USD/CAD is as good as EUR/USD, NZD/USD or EUR/GBP. Just watch your [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide"). Thankfully, my spreads are never above 3 or 4 at Monday open, though in normal times, between 0 and 2.  
  
I'm sure most of us want a similar end, people. For me, it is just about the speedy entry at open. For others, it may be trade manegement. In the end, we all want to consistently make profits from gap trading. Surely we can pool our collective idea and come up with a reliable EA.  
  
I really do hope we find a decent EA for this. If not, I might have to pay the guys at MQL5 to write me one, as they are great.  
  
All the best in your trading

it's s standard MT4 indicator. I use it for nothing more than verification of longer term trade.

Whilst I like the idea of trading stats, has anyone actually looked at why these gaps sometimes appear and sometimes don't ? For instance if there's been some disastrous news for the $ over the weekend surely there'd be no point in try to trade a gap ? I'm not stating this as a fact I was simply wondering if anyone has looked at the reasons behind gaps.   
I'd be interested to hear from some professionals who trade via the interbank market as to what mechanics are at work here.

it uses SMA for determining the trend. you dont want any trend indicator set it to false. If userTradingAllowed is false, it doesnt send orders, it just acts like indi  
  
place this EA on any symbol DAILY chart and let it run. it scans all symbols and lists the gaps above min required in the Comment section and places ordrers. it doesnt do exits right now. unless i know exit strategy i cant code.  
  
if you try to backtest, it works for that symbol ONLY. thats a limitation on MT4. You cant backtest multipair strategies...  
  
pl use and let me know any issues.

D'you think a reasonable exit strategy would be a user-defined X% of the gap and a Ypips SL ? Although this would be simple to include in MPTM which could be used to close the trades.

it could be like that. earlier i tried 75% of gap as TP and 1:1 for SL, it hit SL most of the times before hitting the TP  
  
problem with gap theory is it says gaps do get filled but it doesnt say when. it could take few weeks in some cases. leaving it withput SL is certainly dangerous.  
  
like most of the strategies that 'look' good on paper but get lost due to improper exits, this is also in same category. without a proper exit strategy idea will remain as idea but not as a tradable system

Although I hate to use the dirty word 'optimisation', could you not have these functions as optimisable and then backtest ? You could also include 'number of bars' before exiting. But you are right in that a good looking idea doesnt always make a tradeable strategy. And money management is the key to FX.

I'm with you dr who, I'd love to be able to backtest and optimise, but bottom line for me is I just want automated entry, so features are not that necessary. I can manage the trades with MyFX Console.  
  
I'll test the EA posted by roundrock, though not sure how it knows Friday close and Monday open. For me, they are the only gaps of interest

roundrock, so your EA is *not just* for Sunday gap? What is it showing (ie. default) when it indicates certain pairs as candidates, like when I first apply it this London session? (I certainly will let it run and see what happens)...but would you share a bit more on your EA trading non-traditional times during the week? Like where is the gap, and what is it doing choosing those entry places?  
  
Regards, and *thanks* for sharing it.

you need to put this EA on daily chart. on formation of new bar, it checks for gap between this bar open and prev bar close. if gap is more than the min gap specified it lists them in comments and places orders...  
  
so even if it runs on weekdays it doesnt do anything. you need to keep it running on monday morrning before market opens

Just a word of caution to those who like this idea, since the last trade in the xls file 'Updated Gap Backtest' I reckon for all 4 pairs covered there have been 8 trades up to and including 2nd Jan. 5 have been losers and 3 winners. So take care.....

I do sometimes trade Gold on Sundays. Every time their is a large move right on the open of the futures session (6 PM EST), gold always retraces back to the last close price. I know with [Oanda](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile"), if EURUSD is down or up alot, you can buy or sell gold right before 6 PM EST at the same weekend prices and make a huge profit on the highly probable move. Then I reverse the position and gold usually goes back to the opening price.   
  
In the following picture. EURUSD was down (Open of 12.26.2010). You would sell gold right before it open at 6 PM EST (you can with oanda). Then after you notice signs of a reversal, you would reverse your position and take profit at last Fridays close. This could lead to some huge profits but make sure to manage your risk.

dont understand this ?   
  
also, each broker has different opening time for gold. so the gap times will vary.

Oanda lets you trade virtually 24/7 (yes, you can place trades over the weekend but the [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") are higher and their is no movement).  
  
With that said, EURUSD usually start moving around 2:00 PM on sunday with oanda. So at 5 PM, while most other brokers start trading, you could have been trading with oanda for 3 hours already. But that is besides the point, all you need to know is you can trade 24/7 with oanda.  
  
Now with gold, the official gold market doesn't open until 6 PM on sunday. That means that their is no price movement and with most brokers, you can not trade until 6 PM when the gold market officially opens. However with oanda you can trade before 6 PM. Their are 2 ways you can trade gold.  
  
The first way is more risky. If at 5:45 PM Sunday you see that EURUSD is down more than ~40 pips from fridays close, then you would sell gold right before the Gold market opens (because if EURUSD is down a lot, their is a high probability gold will shoot down.) And you would buy gold if EURUSD is up more than ~40 pips. The reason is that EURUSD show the current value, but since the gold market did not open yet, you would be trading last fridays gold prices. This is the first way, it is a lot more risky but the rewards generally outweight the risk. Make sure to test first.  
  
The second trade you can make is wait for gold to spike up or down. For example in the picture I provided, gold spiked down. Once I saw that it started reversing, I would buy and have my take profit at the original opening price. The reason for this is that whenever gold has a large movement upon open, it always tends to go back to the original opening price.   
  
In short, with the first trade, you are trying to catch the gap using the EURUSD to know if it will go up or down. The second trade is trying to catch the retrace back to the opening price.   
  
A couple of rules. Start trading on sundays. If you are good, you could move on to regular days as well. For the first trade, if their is no major move in EURUSD by the time gold opens, do not trade. And for the second trade, if gold does not spike up or down, do not trade. Their will always be tomorrow.  
  
And you will need to trade on oanda (or any broker that lets you trade 24/7 including the weekends)

on regular days, at what time gold market opens ? i thought it doesnt close at all till friday evening.  
  
on sunday 5:45 PM, when you are buying/selling gold how are the spreads ? do you recommend market order or limit order ? if market order how can you control the market spikes at execution time ?  
  
thanks a lot for sharing this. i have oanda, let me observe this weekend

When we talk about gold and the gold market, most people refer to futures because they dominate the market. Gold futures are open Sun 6 PM --> Friday 5:15 PM and are closed everyday from 5:15 PM --> 6:00 PM. That is why their is virtually no movement during the weekends and everyday from 5:15 to 6:00 PM and most brokers suspend gold trading overall. That is also why most brokers don't allow gold trading till 6 PM on sunday and why their is a very large movement on sunday at 6 PM.  
  
As for spreads, with oanda, I have never seen the spread more than $5 (even for temporary spikes). On the weekend up to the open, you could expect a $2.5 spread which, generally speaking, is huge but remember that their is usually a very large movement right after the open (up to $20 one way).   
  
I always use limit order just in case. Spikes shouldn't be a problem with but it is better to be safe then sorry.  
  
The importaint thing is patience. Their are weeks where their is little volitility and no spike at all. It is better to wait and fight another day. And make sure to watch / demo with oanda for atleast 3 months before trying it out. I suggest only trading on sunday but it also works on weekdays sometimes.

howdy roundrock  
  
Can you tell me how the EA detects a weekend gap specifically, or does it just work off any gap? I really only trade the gaps between Friday close and Monday open.  
  
I don't normally use daily charts for gaps. I prefer to use 5 minute charts. Will that be an issue with this indy?

hi  
  
the chart you posted above is that of eu and not gold.  
  
the problem i see with gap trading on gold is this:  
  
during weekdays there are hardly any significant gaps between day close and open. in fact i could not see any weekdays gaps in the last 2 months on gold.  
  
similarly weekend gaps rarely occur. i only came across one gap of 6 pips in december and one gap in january 2011.   
  
problem is, the gap is so small it is hardly worth trading. it can also be the case that the price may not retrace back to cover the gap. although the majority of the times it does , sometimes it doesn't and just keeps on going one way.....which leaves the question of where to put the stop, and concerns on large drawdowns. just for the sake of a few pips.  
  
so iam curious to know how you exactly trade these gaps and some chart examples would help. how many gaps on average do you trade per month on gold ?  
  
today, there was no weekend gap on gold.  
  
when you say 6pm time on oanda, is that 10pm london time ?  
  
  
regards

A couple of thing I think that you misunderstand and I will try to explain myself better.  
  
First of all, XAU/USD is the symbol for spot gold in USD. So the chart I provided is the price of gold when it opened on Dec. 26th.  
  
Second of all, I meant this strategy should primerily be traded at the start of the week (on Sunday). I have trade this strategy over the last year and a half and I rarely trade on the weekdays, only when EURUSD make a huge move (you can use other USD pairs to confirm that the value of the USD is changing not the EUR, but this is really unnecesary)  
  
Now let me talk about the opening price of gold. In the chart I provided, Gold initially opened about $6 lower but soon traded as much as $12-$13 lower before it showed a sign of a reversal. Now I am not sure if you traded gold before but $13 on gold is a lot, especially within an hour.   
And that is only one way. Remember, you are trading on the original movement and also the retracement. So realistically, you would have made $20 of gold on that day.  
  
As for number of trades a month, it really does depend. Sometimes it is 2 or 3 times and some months I don't trade at all. But when I do, I know that their is a very very high probability that my trade will be favorable and profitable. The thing is, you really only need to be in front of the computer for 2 hours a week (if you only plan on trading sundays, recommended for starters).  
  
Today, I did not trade. EURUSD had made a move but when Gold opened, it was nearly unchanged. And Gold did not make a large move when it opened so their was no retracement trade today either.  
  
You also said that the price sometimes doesn't retraces back to the open, personally I have never seen this on a sunday (I have misses a couple of weeks). I have although seen this on weekdays. I forgot to mention this but you NEVER EVER EVER trade the retracement on weekdays, only on weekends (Sorry, I know this was importaint). For weekdays, you would only trade if their is a HUGE move in EURUSD. But you never trade the retracement on the weekdays, only the original move.  
  
And this leaves us just one question left unanswered. Once you see the signs of a reversal, you place a trade with you take profit just below last fridays close price (a bit below because of the spread) You should place your stop just below the low or above the high gold made. If your stop get hit, that means you will make even more on the retracement so don't be too pissed about it (rarely gets hit). And if your stop is hit 3 times, I would recommend cutting your losses (this never happened and doubt it ever will. Gold would need to drop $50 for this too happen and the chances of that are nearly impossible).  
  
Make sure to use a 15 minute chart to look for reversals. I will post charts later when I find more time. For now, good luck with all you trades.  
  
And I believe 6 PM EST is 11 PM london time. So you would start at 10:45 PM (22:45) london time.

cheers roundrock. A shame. I often find no gaps in my daily charts, but they are certainly there in 1 minute or 5 minute charts.  
  
9am Australian time today as follows:  
  
GBP/AUD Close 1.5614 Open 1.5637 Gap not quite closed yet, currently 1.5631  
EUR/USD Close 1.2907 Open 1.2878 My Trade Result +24  
USD/JPY Close 83.15 Open 83.24 Didn't take it as under 20 pip gap. Trade went on to fill the gap and continue to 83.06 in 42 minutes.  
AUD/USD Close 0.9958 Open 0.9928 Trade Result +26  
AUD/CAD Close 0.9919 Open 0.9861 Gap not filled, but I exited at .9896 for a Trade Result +30  
EUR/CAD Close 1.2824 Open 1.2790 Trade Result +26  
  
Some spreads kill you a bit with these trades so early, but mine don't hit past 4 or 5. Most are around 2 until trade really gets going and then between 0 - 2  
  
There were more under 20 pips, so left them alone.  
  
Such a shame your EA is for daily charts only. Might have to test it anyway and get inside and tweak it for 5 minute charts  
  
Why wouldn't you want to automate trading these little money spinners? As a supplement to your trading, they are great. It's just a pain to monitor so many and enter at market

i see. the question of stop is extremely important. you say if you are trading the retracement up, then the stop should be just below the low. but the low will be about the same point you entered trade ! also not sure what you mean by 3 stops being hit ? that would be a disaster and will take months of weekend gap trading to recover.  
  
i have seen one weekend where the price never retraced but kept on going one way, that one trade itself would have thrown you back a few months. so i think this needs to be given a thought.

hi honkin,  
  
what method do you use to trade your gaps ?  
  
some of the pairs you have listed , my brokers weekend spread for those are just huge. around 13 pips ! so not any significant gains to be made there.

can you try other brokers like [FXCM](/brokers/fxcm "View FXCM Broker Profile") or any other broker who shows gaps on daily chart ?  
  
anyway here is the changed EA that would work off any TF. you can drop it on any TF and if it finds gap it trades. i didnt test this, but should work. you can also chose not to apply sma rule

> The first way is more risky. If at 5:45 PM Sunday you see that EURUSD is down more than ~40 pips from fridays close, then you would sell gold right before the Gold market opens (because if EURUSD is down a lot, their is a high probability gold will shoot down.) And you would buy gold if EURUSD is up more than ~40 pips. The reason is that EURUSD show the current value, but since the gold market did not open yet, you would be trading last fridays gold prices....

Hi Kowalczky,  
  
Interesting strategy. So is 40 pips the "magic number"? I notice on Sunday EURUSD had gapped down ~33 pips, but XAUUSD moved up on open according to my MT4 broker chart. Did you trade this?

Howdy roundrock  
  
Thanks so much for tweaking this EA. I'll give it a try/ I dropped FXCM ages ago when they couldn't handle my news trades. Their [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") became quite ludicrous during news.

The best "Gap" strategies are really just natural tendencies. For example, the EURUSD opens lower at the Sydney Open than it did on Friday's close roughly 65% of the time. However, when the market does open lower during the Sydney Open, it continues to drop for about 4 hours 70+% of the time. However, the Sydney open has little effect on most other currencies. One strategy usually only works with one currency, not every market and every interval. Be sure to backtest these theories so you can have a better view of the market as a whole rather than being led blindly.  
  
Happy Trading :-)

Although EURUSD did go down as much as ~33 pips, at 5:45, it was only down about 10 pips, so I would not have traded. Also, their was no spike when it opened so I wouldn't trade the retracement either. It has to be down or up atleast 40-50 pips at 5:45 (the more the better). The basic principle behind this strategy is that is EURUSD is down more than 40 pips, the USD got stronger, therefore gold (vs. the dollar, XAU**USD**) should make a large move down also.

I will try to reexplain myself using the chart I posted. The 4th candlestick was a doji followed by a large bullish candlestick. That is a reversal signal. You would close your short position and enter long. Your stop for the long position would below the 5th candlestick (because it reached the lowest point before the reversal).  
  
Now lets say gold went even lower, your stop would be hit. Then you would wait for another reversal signal (do not enter a short position). Once you see a reversal signal, you would enter long with your stop below the new low.   
  
If your stop got hit again you would repeat.  
  
If your stop gets hit 3 times (I have never seen this happen), you would just stop trading and cut your losses. The thing is, if your stop got hit 3 times, you would lose $10-$15 dollars on gold, but if your trade is sucessful, you would make atleast $20+ on gold so even if your stops get hit 3 times, your not really in trouble.  
  
The great thing about this strategy is that if you stop gets hit once or even twice, you would make even more money because the retracement would be a lot larger, so don't get mad.  
  
Also, could you please provide a date or chart of a time when gold never retraced.

i dont know how to load charts here. but i can provide you with the date gold never retraced.  
  
also, there are hardly any weekend gaps on gold . maybe once in a month. and even then the gap usually is not significant enough. how many gaps do u get a month and which broker are you using ? what time of day do you get these gaps in GMT ?  
  
i do not think your trading criteria would work on weekday gaps though. or gaps on any other fx pairs.

The number of trades really depend on the month. Sometimes it is two or three and sometimes it is zero. I rarely trade on weekdays. And as for the gap, it is usually more than sufficient to make a nice profit.  
  
Please provide a day when gold never retraced.

sure. gold never retraced on the weekend of 20/12/2010. opened up with a gap. never retraced back down to fill the gap. so you would have been stopped out here on whatever stop level you entered.  
  
also, i did a quick backtest on alpari. hardly any gaps come about and those that do are not worth trading:  
  
  
  
27/9 - no gap - no trade  
  
4/10 - only 1 pip gap - no trade  
  
11/10 - 4 pip gap. not worth trading - after spread - no trade  
  
18/10 - 2 pips gap - no trade  
  
27/10 - no gap - no trade  
  
1/11 - 5 pips gap. possible trade but just 1/2 pips to be made !  
  
8/11 - 2 pip gap - no trade  
  
15/11 - 1 pip gap - no trade  
  
22/11 - 3 pip gap - no trade  
  
29/11 - no gap - no trade  
  
6/12 - no gap - no trade  
  
13/12 - 3 pip gap. no trade.  
  
27/12 - 4 pip gap - no trade  
  
31/12 - no gap - no trade  
  
10/1 - no gap  
  
  
  
so my friend, i cant see any single gap trading oppurtunity in the last 2.5 months . i would like to see where you get your figures from, and what results you have had.  
  
  
  
also, you say on the opening of the gap, you wait for the market to move in the same direction, then after a reversal occurs then enter trade. but what if reversal occurs on the opening of the gap itself ?  
  
  
  
for example, say gold opened with a gap 'UP' by 8 pips. so we would need to enter short so that when gold retraces back down our gap would be filled and we would win the trade. but you say to wait for gold to go up more before entering a short. and once its gone up and then reverses back down, then to enter short.  
my question to you is, when gold opens on the gap, what if it immediately goes back down ? does not go up. when would we enter short ? we wont have a chance to because we will be waiting for the market to go up before entering short, which it never did. and we would have missed our short. what do you do then ? this occurs a lot. prime example on the 1/11/2010.  
  
  
also, what about stops ?? sometimes market goes up/down by even 15 or more pips before filling the gap !  
a huge amount of pips to lose just to make 6-7 pips when the gap fills, and there is no guarantee the gap will fill.   
  
  
so, i would like to see your results and what you do. because i cant see how this would work...

also, on the above example, if we wait for gold to go up more before entering short, at what point do we decide it has gone up as much as possible ? and when to enter short ? kind of hard to predict. if you enter short say 2-3 candles after, it may still go up after that.

Hi guys,  
  
I'm just wondering, why not just create a gap ea with the exact open price of the gap on sunday and the TP should be close of the gap or in other words close of last friday's candle. I do trade manually every monday and its a success for major pairs, dare not trade with exotic pairs due to uncertainty, of course with some losses but overall its profitable.  
  
also i would like to know if gap trader ea could be enhanced to have the setting above instead letting the percentage decide the SL and TP.  
  
I've tried gap trader baktest and its showing positive results however the data isn't true let me know if you face the same.  
  
cheers!!!!!!......

hi... weekend gap does not show and backtest results. of i'm doing plotting it wrongly....  
  
my strategy very simple... i wake up at the start of the day on sunday night or monday morning at my timezone and will monitor those mt4 screens with high gaps using TF Daily . if yes i open trade... normally i would max out with the TP right up to the close of last week candle...as history tells that gap always closes the windows exactly for major pairs and crosses. As for the exotic pairs... i have no idea to trade gap or even brave enough to trade them as it looks a bit scary due to their spreads and not having a good history for closing gaps.

not always. sometimes the gaps dont close. sometimes there is a huge drawdown before gap closes. so how do you handle that ? for example eu this week opened with gap down, never closed the gap, missed it by about 5 pips.

depends on which broker you are looking at i guess.  
gaps on ibfx are quite different than say gaps on gomarket or [fxpro](/brokers/fxpro "View FxPro Broker Profile").

Sorry, I was busy this week. I would not have, and will not traded this week. Their was no major movement in the USD before gold opened and their was no strong movement. If you look at the 15 min. chart, gold did make a ~$5 movement but the candle closed more than halfway down. The next candle was bullish but failed to make new highs. And the third candlestick was bearish and went lower than the previous candlestick. This shows that there is / was no strong movement. And even though gold is making new highs as I type this, its better to play it safe than sorry, so I will not be trading today. As we clarified before, these opportunities are few and far between, but when they do occur, they are almost a guaranteed profit.  
  
As for the dates you provided earlies, I will try to look over them later this week.

14 pips is not nearly enough. Remember, the point of this strategy is to capture large moment in Gold from the USD weakening or getting stronger. The reason I trade gold is because, you basically trade last Fridays gold prices when you have current currency values.

Hi kowalczyk,  
For my first time to try and see how your system could have worked yesterday, I see EUR/USD gapping down and gold gapping up. I thought you said the euro's gap a proxy for the gold's? I wonder if you can tell what I am not getting right here.

Today was a good day for trading gold. Gold opened trading up. Saw a dojo at 19:00 (on the 15-min chart) and gold went downhill from there.   
I was short at 1344.30 and took profit at 1339.25 for a profit of $5.05. Odds are it will go lower to ~1337 (bid+ask/2) but I decided to secure my profit.  
  
Also, you could have traded the initial move. In this instance it would be different. Obviously, because of the Egypt debacle, gold and the USD are becoming stronger. So since people were putting money into th USD, it only made sense they put money into gold too. I know this goes against the rules but given the riots in Egypt, you should not have shorted gold on the open. The safest play is to just stay out (which is what I did).

When gold opened, EUR/USD did not make a large enough move so I would not have traded the open. Now for the retrace, gold did make quite a run. You might have been stopped out once but you would have made that back and then some. Personally, I did not trade that setup because I did not expect gold to make such a move and stopped watching after a while, but last weeks open was tradeable.

Yesterday we saw good gaps on both gold and euro, but again in complete opposite directions.   
I can't find the relationship between the euro and gold.

I see what you are trying to say. Their are unfortunately times when Gold and EURUSD go the oppisite ways. When I first started to trade this strategy, I only traded the retracement. Then I started trading the initial move too. However times have apparently changed. Currently, Gold goes the direction of the EURUSD about 65% of the time. So for now, you might only want to play the retracement, not the initial move.

I took the gap on E/U. It was large and easy to trade. But I trailed my SL too early and got ousted at BE. The pair went +80 pips in gap closing direction.

What brokers do you guys use for trading the gaps? I'm looking at FXDD as the only viable option for a US trader who is looking to open an account with a low initial deposit requirement.  
  
Others seem to have downtime at the required hour or don't open until 6pm EST on Sundays, which is too late in my opinion.  
  
Thanks.

Hi Gap Traders,  
  
I traded the EUR/USD today, with a 1:1 risk reward ratio.   
  
The trade:  
Entry 1.35067  
Stop 1.34700  
Limit 1.35480  
  
I manually exited trade at 1.3545 for + 39 pips.  
  
Hope everyone pulled some pips out as well.

Well done !  
I was in at 13510, but pulled my stop loss too soon and got ousted at BE.

You must have gone in late to get that price of 1.3506. Lucky or clever. I went in at 1.3520 but got stopped out at 1.3502. Sods law states it then rebounded. So in this case a loser but it has been working OK overall.  
  
PS Dont expect to get this lucky always as my data shows you wont make a profit in the longrun with those settings you have.

Why isn't it possible to backtest your EA with MT4??

Is it possible to change it to 4 digit? Or would that be to much work?  
  
Because my broker ([Activtrades](/brokers/activtrades "View ActivTrades Broker Profile")) starts with his 5-digit accounts, 1 hour later. And to that time: the show is still finished![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Thank You pircj/Jerry for kindly making your Formula available ... I am a beginner in mq4, but will be interested to learn how to backtest it.

The Sunday Gap EA preformed as it should. Thanks  
  
Most of the AUD pairs did not make a profit. Not EA fault.  
  
Suggestion:  
  
1) Is it possible to set a maximum spread . The AUDNZD spread was about 20 pips.  
  
2) Some background on the workings of the EA . What the settings are for eg the use of ATR etc

I have not yet used this EA but would it have taken all these trades successfully? I noticed the gaps on all the majors filled quite promptly last night.

Honkin,  
  
How are you mate? I have also been trading the gaps over the last couple of years with great success however of late my broker FXDD has been having a bit of a shocker with [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") etc.  
  
May I ask which broker you trade with mate.   
  
Kind regards

My broker allows trading from 20:00 GMT on Sunday until 22:00 GMT Friday  
In most Mt4 platforms market opens at 23:00 GMT (my time)  
  
Extra 3 hours...  
  
So I'm looking at 2 gaps, from 2 different brokers, one at 20:00 another at 23:00  
Gaps are great for using  
1) Filling gaps, my statistics show that the most probable outcome is 78,8% of gap range.  
2) Also I am using it to reverse a position a the top/ bottom of a gap.  
3) Or if there is a nice big bullish/bearish candle I will keep a position for larger move..statistics show that it have an importance on the future price action (use it not only to fill a gap)

there is no such thing as gap, the market keep moving during the weekend, the gag comes from where your broker close on friday and where it open on sunday, so if your broker close on friday at 1.5505 and the market is moving during the weekend and price is at 1.6505 and your broker opens at that price you think it's a gap but it's not

There are many ways of investing money...this one is pretty simple  
This "Weekend Gap" is just an empty space on a chart...the most important thing is this: It really works!  
  
The best way to learn any method is to analysis it..a lot!  
  
You may not like it, but many trade it with great success.

<http://i54.tinypic.com/286xuso.jpg>  
  
This for instance is not a gap for me... yesterday gap on eurusd had only 2 points...I search for gaps a least 5 point  
Enter them as soon as spread is normal  
on EurUsd I have 10p. spread at open  
after 20-minutes it gets normal to 2p.  
the same with other pairs  
  
Remember look at 3-4 brokers to compare gaps  
Remember the bigger the gap the better (look for 10pips or more)

Memento - what kind of stop loss do you use when trading the gap(say you target 75% of the gap as your TP)?  
or do you close on time expiry?  
  
I used Pircj EA (Sunday Gap Trader v1) to backtest - you can specify TP and SL based on a percentage of the gap. (I optimized backtests of TP = 25% to 200% and SL = 1 to 4 times the TP)  
  
Some results were amazing and others were horrible. Furthermore, they were not consistent across pairs. I lose confidence in the trading strategy when such strong optimization is needed to get good results - essentially curve fitting to each pair.  
  
Thus my question regarding your SL if you find much success trading gaps. Thanks for the comment re:waiting 20 minutes for spreads to come down before entering.  
  
Thanks!  
  
If anyone is interested, Pircj included code(but had it deactivated) for trading his EA by AccountBalance instead of FreeMargin. Here is the EA where risk is based on AccountBalance instead of FreeMargin.

C'mon, gap traders! is gap trading dead? nobody gap traded since april, even those huge gaps this week end? I took the one on nzd/yen, for a mere 20 pips Could have got the double, but my hands shooke .  
One question now: why do some gaps close and others not? how do you tell which will do what beforehand? I am sure there is a way. But for now I just play gaps to close, but noticed that when they don't, they explode to the opposite direction.  
  
best,  
Muntu 

Patience is magic

Ive been trading the sunday gap for over a year now and i ask myself the same question. Some brokers closing time on Friday differ by an hour and often there is quite alot of movement in the last hour so this affects the gap. Daylight saving and public holidays also affect gap performance. I dont trade gaps the week London or New York wind their clocks forward or back for Daylight saving. Any other ideas?

Hi Krumpip,  
Looks like [Oanda](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile") is very reliable for gaps. On sundays I can see them quoting way before all the others I know of. For instance, this sunday, I had chosen to trade N/J. It opened with my broker around 67.45. Having watched it trade as low as 67.25 on Oanda, after a close on friday above 67.70, I thought it would continue on its way up and bought. And it did fill the gap.   
I just recently got comfortable trading this way and know nothing about the effect of those especial week ends on gaps.   
Have you found some success so far trading gaps?  
Best,  
Muntu

Hey Guys  
  
Where can I find Gap Indicator that will show arrow in the direction of the gaps. The gap should be between previous M5 candle lowest price and its next M5 candle highest price when in downtrend and vise versa. The gap can be a small as 1 pip.   
  
Thanks for sharing.

Hi Steve,  
Talking of Hang seng, looks like depends on which broker your are with. I know one that gaps almost every day and one that is continuous. Do you trade it? I tried and failed miserably.

My beginner's question to gap-traders. Would the following strategy work? :  
  
Pending buy/sell-stop orders are placed during last minute(s) of broker's Friday night, just before weekend closure. Distance between orders would be around 10-15pips and there would be proper SL/TP targets. Pairs of choice would only be eurusd, gpbusd, audusd and usdchf.  
  
Then during the first opening minute of monday sufficient move would spike through and activate one of pending orders, off cource providing that there is no slippage with pending order execution. If there is no sufficient gap during first seconds, orders would be manually closed.  
  
Am I missing something here?

Especially since you are relying on zero spreads when the market opens on Monday, which is almost impossible.   
  
What I think is missing in you plan is getting prepared to the case in which the gaps is opened against you-that is very dangerous.   
  
If you want to trade gaps, don’t try to predict whether a gap will be opened or not. Wait till it is opened and then try to take the currency to the gap’s closing levels (gaps tend to be closed eventually) .

Very dangerous, more gambling than trading IMHO. Remember the spreads can be 10 times their regular figure at that time. At times pairs behave like when the NFP figures are released.

Ok, but what if broker has fixed spreads (at all times) and very fast /almost instant execution?

I don't know of such broker yet, but you are the one to decide for your strategy. For yours truly that would still be gambling. I try to have a clue as for the direction before acting.

Completely agree. Have you tried the KOSPI? Hangseng is the only index I have tried for a significant period.

Hi Kowalczyk, how is your strategy faring so far ? Sure you have improved it. I am now ready to trade it under your supervision. Give me your actualised instructions ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1).  
  
Happy Pips to you in 2012 !

So for now, you might only want to play the retracement, not the initial move.

Wondering what has happened to all the gaps ?   
  
No gaps today or last Sunday....  
  
Previous 2 weeks I saw about 6 big gaps on different pairs.

This weekend gap has already closed for EUR/USD. By my record keeping, we crossed back to overall positive from negative on the year with this weeks close. My results are based on trades closing by end of week if gap did not close. Last time we were positive for the year was in mid-February. I take 3 pips from each trade for spread.

The _ONLY_ way to enter trades using this method is when the markets open again, otherwise you will not know which way to trade.  
  
BTW Friday's gbpusd gap was closed this afternoon @ 1500 gmt.

Hi,  
Have you examined the three big (-563 pips) losing trades for possible reasons why they failed?  
  
What conclusions did you arrive at?

Hi Everyone,  
  
Be careful when you trade gaps. Sometimes price just keeps on going. Then, where do you put your SL i.e. how deep are your pockets? One hit SL could wipe out all your gains, then you have to wait another whole week to claw a bit back.  
  
It's better if it gaps during your daytime hours, then you can maybe watch it and catch more pips when price has exhausted itself and starts to head back towards the gap.  
  
If price gaps completely outside the Friday range, then it usually keep s on going, so just trade WITH the gap.  
  
Cheers,  
  
  
Mike

Frani's chart illustrates one problem with gap trading that in my view relates to SL question put by Blott: as with any other method, gap trading is better done in a trending market. If the trend is there, I prefer the gap to go against it. I then enter when the trend resumes and put my sl below the lowest point reached by the gap, if long. This way you can remain in the trade for a couple of days at times. At least this is the way I play it: the must close then continue some.  
  
The market opening gap can offer one of the best times for a very tight SL, IMHO, but risk is always there, so always take it easy.  
  
BTW I am still in my E/U trade, though not very far. My SL is at BE and ... we'll see

i think the problem ist that someone mean to make huge pips with gap trading, don`t be greedi, i dont need 40 pips, its enough to get 10 pips and always monitor the pairs this is important, but everyone must manage his trades how he mean, ok its shit if you take 10 pips and see you could get 20, 30 or 40 pips but better 10 pips than a loss

Got it wrong on e/u and e/y last night, as the gaps keep widening. Now back in short, as it seems to be the new trend.  
Got it ok with u/chf, which mitigates my loss.

For me e/u gap was too small. Whats the smallest gap size you will take?

On my platform the gap was 11 pips.   
But I believe the unusual -cooked up?-NFP report brought the big banks into play and they dictated the way to follow.

Do you make the difference between novice gaps VS pro gaps?  
Not all gaps are good to trade, especially when you take into account the supply/demand levels.  
Here is a video from Sam Seiden (perhaps somebody knows him?) that explains the difference between those 2 types of gaps.   
It really helped me when I was starting.

Thanks for sharing, but I find that all those categories are only seen in hindsight , same as continuation or exhausting gaps. You can't tell at the opening which gap will turn what, imho.

As you know, I make it a point to trade "The Gap" every Friday. While I missed my specific trade last weekend, I got caught with two open orders. The both gaped in the correct directions giving me $400+ profit.  
  
I liken the Forex to a river. It's level is constantly changing throughout the week from people getting in and out. Over the 48 hour weekend, it settles or moves into equilibrium. Thus, a gap is formed.  
  
It's just an easy way to look at it.

Can you explain your point more?  
The goal in forex trading, or basically all type of trading is to have a definitive % chance of being in profit. You just need to win 51% of the time to be profitable... (compare this to 49% at best if you go to the casino, with something like Roulette)  
  
So by making the difference between pro and novices gaps, and choosing which one to trade by looking at simple things like support/resistance and trend, its possible to increase the overall % chance of being right. Of course we are not aiming at 100% success, but if you can go to 75% that is already very nice.  
  
Anyways market will open in approx 1 hour for me, and I just wanna share a way to have access to pre-market quotes for free with a demo account from [Oanda](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile"). I just made a quick explanation video about it = [http://www.forextradingnomad.com/for...otes-for-free/](http://www.forextradingnomad.com/forex-live-pre-market-quotes-for-free/)

In my opinion there is no guaranteed way of saying that a gap, especially an exhausting gap is of such category until the trend reverses and goes against the gap. But maybe I still have some practice ahead.  
You don't need to be right 51% of the time, although preferable, you only need your profits when you win to outweigh your losses.

It's an interval which represent on areas where no trading takes place. It has two trends upward and Downward trend.  
  
Upwards, it is shaped while the highest price of one day is less than the lowest price of the following other days.   
  
Downwards, it produced a gap while the lowest price of one day is higher than the highest price of the following days.

True, I didnt paint the big picture. If you win as much as you loose, you need that 1%, but if you win 10 times more, you only need 10%.  
  
Anyways today there were no major gaps, and only the Yen pairs showed some signs of volatility. I only took a quick long on EJ at market open (touched the support + small gap), and im already out.

Hey, market will open in 30mins for me (my broker opens 1h early), so I already checked some pre-market quotes ([I explained here how to get them for free ](http://www.forextradingnomad.com/forex-live-pre-market-quotes-for-free/)).  
  
Looks we won't have any major gaps, most volatility I see is on the Pound, GU and GJ are almost breaking out Friday's closing price. Might be a good time to short.  
Notice that shorting is much better than buying during high volatility (wide spread) periods, since the bid is drawing the price, you are not theoretically losing money on the spread by entering the trade (you'll cover later, with a smaller spread).

For what broker to use you and your colleague? Sunday, or even on other days? To me it does not work on Sundays.

Well gaps usually appear on sunday's open... if you see gaps during the week that means you have a pretty bad broker ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
But its not every sunday that has gaps, since they are an "irregularity" of the price, sometimes the market just open where it closed Friday. 

If you aim for the stars- but miss, you still get the moon...

Gaps are actually the hardest thing to trade, they are too unpredictable and very very broker dependent. Ultimately gapping is entirely dependent on the broker Liquidity and the number of banks used in their price stream.

Who was there 2 weeks ago? When there was BOJ talks about the next finance minister?  
  
We had 200 pips gaps on the yen pairs... I never traded something that big before I believe.

I feel sorry for the Cypriots. Their government will be taking 10% from everyone's bank account (except those rich people who were pre-warned!) as a condition of the bailout.   
  
Keep your cash under the bed!

You can trade [Oanda](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile") all weekend if you brave enough but the rest open when they want. In other words when they have figured out which way price is going.

Hi Everyone,  
  
Since posting at the start of page 1, I have changed my strategy on weekend gaps. For longer term profits, as suggested by Muntu a while back, the best strategy is to trade with the gap i.e. if it gaps down...go short & vice versa.  
  
Does anyone have an EA coded to trade with the gap? If so, I'd like to optimise various currency pairs to find the best SL/TP for each pair and publish my findings.  
  
With other EAs, I've found it quite useful to be able to place pending orders, to enter the trade only when it shows a conviction in the desired direction, so I think this would be a desirable feature too.  
  
Attached is 2 week data for August 2013.  
  
Cheers,  
  
  
Mike

My friend Blott, I am attaching a chart of the present behavior of the bund after a gap at the open this morning. Since a couple of months I am gravitating towards Market profile and Tape reading as my main tools.  
As you can see, have you gone short right then you'd have had some trouble coming out profitable. But had you waited for it to revisit some previous zones, you could have gotten some clues as to which direction to take. I've come to the conclusion that as with all decision aids in trading, there is no sure fire rule, TIMING IN CONTEXT IS ALWAYS KING.  
Actually, there is something that dictates its law even in the face of a gap and that is the previous level: open, close, value areas, Poc 's of past days/weeks. I have marked some for you to see . I am sure you can have similar situations on your own charts.  
As for statistics, make sure you have at least 20 occurrences before drawing a conclusion.  
As for an EA, I know nothing about them and will continue to try without. The best EA you can dream of is between pour 2 eyes. It only requests you to think in probabilities, provided you have an edge.

Hi Muntu,  
Thanks for taking the time to share your thoughts, and for your charts. I have to reluctantly agree with you (not because I don't want to, but because I fell for all the hype that we are all bombarded with by shysters, that an EA will make you rich overnight; only the vendor becomes night overnight!) that the best EA is between our ears!  
I am also coming to the conclusion that trading with the gap is not the panacea I thought it would be![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f612.png?v=15.1)As we progress through our trading journey, we discard various indicators and ideas that don't work (for us) and slowly come to an understanding of what really moves the market (apart from fear & greed), and in my opinion that is:- a. where the bank customers buy/sell orders are and b. that the banks periodically have to re-balance their currencies, otherwise they end up with too much of one currency, leaving them overexposed like a store keeper with too much of one product! Not forgetting volume, of course, the one indicator that the banks cannot fool us with, as it costs them to fake volume!  
  
You may like to visit the Metaquotes site articles about cluster indicators <http://articles.mql4.com/484> and <http://www.mql4.com/search#!keyword=cluster> Some interesting stuff there. I attach a pic showing an example of cluster indicators in action. You will see from Powerlines indicator that the USD is coming down and AUD has flattened out, and from CC that USD and AUD are moving towards each other. Hopefully they will intersect (where there will be indecision) and hopefully they will continue in opposite directions.  
  
This is a bit off-topic for gap trading, so I may start a new thread.  
  
Regards

Who's trading the gaps today?  
  
There is bank holiday in Japan, so if we have gaps on Yen pairs, that might be a good opportunity!

Big gaps on AUD! (market opens 1 hour earlier on [Exness](/brokers/exness "View Exness Broker Profile"))  
I know we have a news coming up, Home Loans monthly, but I think 60 pips+ is an exaggerated movement! I am taking shorts positions on EURAUD.

Hi  
  
Many traders try for holy grail trading indicator. I too tried to redevelop one. I feel it is quite impossible to develop of that kind, but I have confidence of developing a "HOLY GRAIL TRADING SYSTEM" with a few conditions. Now i am working on that . You can think why should i talk about holy grail trading system in the GAP FORUM. Yes when i started develop a system, i found that my system did not miss not even a single gap. In India GAP comes often in the NIFTY50 Index.

Hi everybody... this is my first ever post. Does anyone know why there are no weekend gaps on the majors the last couple of months? Someone told me it's because of the Ukraine crisis. What do you think?

Its been a long time after I created this thread. So there are some interesting findings.  
  
Seems that following the gap direction is more profitable than going opposite as per the original method.  
  
I've been developing in MT5 and not so much in MT4.  
  
I observed that gap trading depends heavily on the broker you use. Those who are making money from this method can share what brokers you are using?

Hi doshur  
  
thanks for your reply. I'm using Teletrade since last May and all the gaps since then were filled up, except the one on EUR/USD two weeks ago. Of course I have to mention that the gaps these four months were not many neither big. However right now at the moment I'm writing this reply there is a huge gap of 130 pips on GBP/USD. I'm in with 3 longs and hope it will close.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f64f.png?v=15.1)

I have been testing the Sunday gap for some time on a few pairs and I was wondering if ts it possible to create EA with the following inputs (that can be changed to fit the different pairs). I checked some already existing EAs but they do not allow to modify all the inputs and also none of them takes the spread into account  
  
Trade to fill the gap  
\- open trade only if gap is bigger than X pips  
\- open trade only if spread is smaller than X pips  
\- risk per trade 2% of account  
  
Stop loss. Two cases  
\- if gap is between X and Y pips, then SL is set to SL=Gap size +the current spread (spread should always be taken into account when placing the SL)  
-if gap is more than X pips then set SL to SL =10pips + the current spread  
  
Would be nice if its possible to have the SL flexible to fit different rules. For example, if the gap is between 5 and 10 pips..SL is gap size + spread. IF gap is 11-20pips....Sl is fixed at 10 pips...if between 21 and 50 SL is fixed at 20..and so on

Good day GAP traders,  
  
I have read all the postings in this thread and find it interesting. In my experience I do better with the DAILY TF. I look for the indicator to ARROW signal a direction but not enter immediately. To me I am willing to let the first day go by and if the indicator was CORRECT in its prediction then I am willing to take on DAY #2 in the direction indicated by the arrows. I also basket trade with this concept and have done well. I use SL but DO NOT use TP but followup with a manual SL or if going to bed, a TS instead. One more thing, paying attention to PIN BARS IN THE DAILY TF can really pay off. Here is my latest win in that regard. I also favor PENDING ORDERS and try to let the price action sweep me in, less stress in my opinion.

Hello Gap traders,  
  
I have found a few pairs that I would risk a trade on with a STOP LOSS IN POSITION. Normally I would position trade above the price and there is no GAP to temp others. The trend has been heading up lately so lets see what happens.[Attachment ](https://www.forexfactory.com/attachment/file/1923176)

This is what I am looking for in a trade,  
Double line change of direction  
Pull backs against the line change to set up PENDING ORDERS ABOVE THE DOWN BARS AGAINST THE DOUBLE LINE UP TREND. And most importantly STOP LOSS SET, JUST IN CASE I AM WRONG!! There are allot of charts in the down mode that are showing GAP UP ARROWS, BE CAREFUL, COULD BE A TRAP. Until they make the DOUBLE LINE CHANGE TO GREEN, I feel better placing PENDING ORDERS TO THE DOWNSIDE.  
  
Here are some PENDING ORDERS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CHART TO PONDER OVER.

ALERT!!!!  
  
There might be a change of direction coming for this pair. PENDING ORDERS ABOVE MIGHT NOT HURT TO HAVE READY.

Aleart!!! Positions exploding. Take a look. Please look at "PENDING POSITIONS BELOW CHART. Not to late to take a position. Look to the left at the last time it took off. Should give you a clue as to the possibilities.

Hello Gap traders,  
  
As you can plainly see there are no GAPS but that should not stop us from taking a favorable trade. Not only that but when a GAP ARROW FAILS ITS PROJECTED DIRECTION ITS CAUSE FOR A REVERSE TRADE POSSIBILITY. Lets concentrate on one pair, USE/JPY, please note I take two positions per chart. One BUY/STOP PENDING, one SELL/STOP PENDING AT THE SAME TIME. Along with my STOP/LOSS POSITION it sets me up for a SLAM REVERSAL BY THE BIG BOYS. So on this chart I have moved my STOP/LOSS UP TO LOCK IN MY PROFIT NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS TODAY. Its a FREE TRADE NOW. It is 3:45 PST in California and a new bar is forming since 2:00 PST. This next bar should be a money maker in my opinion. I find that TUESDAYS are serious moving days and we are forming that right now. We will see. Look to the left the last time it made a move like this.

Here you go, it is 05:36 PST CALIF. NOW. STOP LOSS HAVE BEEN MOVED AND PENDING ORDERS TRIMED WAY BACK, I am at MAX LIMIT TO OWN. JEEJAY, the arrow mentioned is the GAP ARROW that is not involved right now. I put the current yellow arrow in to draw attention to where to start the entry move. Sorry if I confused you. The GAP ARROW issue will be discussed when it next appears. I have a thought on how to use it in a trade a little more safely.

Have moved STOP LOSS POSITIONS TIGHTER, WHY YOU ASK? Because it is 1:45 PST AND THE NEXT BAR STARTS FORMING AT 2:00 PST. As you can see I have a nice PROFITABLE BASKET and do not plan on giving much of it back if any!!!

Stopped out of one pair and added one pair, moved some STOP LOSS. Check chart positions for possible clues.

GAP BAR ALERT ON EU/NZ.  
I place a SELL STOP UNDERNEATH THE TAIL OF THE ARROW w/STOP LOSS ABOVE ABOUT 500 PIPS. I use the CROSSHAIR TOOL at the top of the chart, click on it, place on chart, click and drag from a GRID LINE TO THE NEXT GRID LINE, look at Middle number and it should give you an idea of how much is needed for the price to breath. POINTS TO CONSIDER:  
1\. PRICE BAR IS DOWN  
2\. DOUBLE LINE IS BEING CRUSHED  
3\. GAP ARROW APPEARED ON A NON-OPENING DAY, looks to me like someone is anxious to get in position before major move. If not, it should not trigger and you can delete it later.  
4\. THERE IS ALSO A GREAT PIN BAR SHOWING.

As you have probably figured out I am in two threads at the same time. Please go to NLD POST# 3930 to see my comments on the USD/JPY CHART. That is if you are interested. I know there is NO GAP showing at this time on the chart but you may learn something.

> Good day GAP traders, I have read all the postings in this thread and find it interesting. In my experience I do better with the DAILY TF. I look for the indicator to ARROW signal a direction but not enter immediately. To me I am willing to let the first day go by and if the indicator was CORRECT in its prediction then I am willing to take on DAY #2 in the direction indicated by the arrows. I also basket trade with this concept and have done well. I use SL but DO NOT use TP but followup with a manual SL or if going to bed, a TS instead. One more...

Hello ahamidz,  
  
Yes the arrow is the GAP ARROW INDICATOR, WITH ONE CHANGE UNDER INPUTS, THE SIZE GAP I USE IS (100) NOT (5).  
What I am trying to show you is the ARROW CAN BE POSSIBLY TRADED TWO WAYS.  
First: The GAP ARROW IS MADE ON THE SUNDAY/MONDAY BAR. I PREFER JUST TO WAIT UNTIL 2:00 PST DAY CHANGE, WHICH WOULD BE TUESDAY TO PLACE ANY PENDING POSITION ORDER.  
Second: I LOOK FOR ANY BAR THAT HAS A HIGH CHANCE OF TAKING OFF, FOR INSTANCE, "STAR BAR", "PIN BAR". A STAR BAR CAN HAVE PENDING ORDER AT THE TOP (TO BUY) AND THE BOTTOM (TO SELL) AT THE SAME TIME. WHEN ONE TRIGGERS THE OTHER IS CANCELLED.  
THE PEN BAR HAS A MASSIVE TAIL SHOWING TOTAL REJECTION TO THE "BEARS", IT IS AS THOUGH EVERYONE IS ON BOARD FOR, IN THIS CASE, A UPWARD MOVE, WHICH I ENJOYED VERY MUCH. DO NOT FORGET THAT EACH PENDING ORDER HAS A LEAST A 500 STOP LOSS WITH IT. NO UNCOVERED POSITIONS PLEASE.  
Third: WHEN THE ARROW APPEARS AND SUNDAY/MONDAY BAR IS DONE, I PLACE A PENDING ORDER ON THE TAIL END OF THE ARROW JUST IN CASE THERE IS A SLIGHT CHANCE OF A QUICK BUCK TO BE MADE. IN THE CASE OF THE "PIN BAR" IT WAS VERY GOOD TO DO SO WHEN IT SWUNG MUCH LOWER FIRST BEFORE RECOVERING ALL THE WAY BACK UP AND CHANGING THE COLOR OF THE BAR. IN THE LOWER TIME FRAMES YOU SEE THIS ALL THE TIME AND WITH THE SPREAD AND PRICE ACTION YOU STAND A CHANCE OF SUCCEEDING, BUT A "DAILY PIN BAR" LOOOOK OUT, THIS COULD BE A BIG MOVE, AND I STATED THAT IN MY POSTED CHART BEFORE THE MOVE.  
  
LETS START WITH THIS AND WAIT FOR NEXT WEEK AND SEE WHAT WE GET TO DO!!

Hi Moonbeam15  
You indicated that the method of generosity. Thanks . My Group system the short term. This is a bug. In the short term market behavior will change quickly. Recognizing this need to be investigated further the week. But apparently does not change behavior long term. Our group tries systems have a long term strong and profitable hundred percent. Both methods use. The robber Bank is always working. stop loss hit . And in this work has been successful. Robber Bank knows all indicators. It helps indicator is produced. Puts free of charge. We have to know how to strike  
If you can send GAP ARROW INDICATOR  
I'm sorry for the bad translation Google

Hello ahhamidz,  
Your English is good enough to understand that you would like to have the igap indicator, no problem. REMEMBER TO GO INSIDE THE INDICATOR UNDER INPUTS AND CHANGE THE NUMBER (5) TO THE NUMBER (100).  
GOOD PIP HUNTING TO YOU!!

If you like gap trading... You may also Like Liquidty gap trading... Whats a liquidty gap?   
A liquidty gap is basicly a spike... A gap where market had no liquidty and spiked right though it..   
Spikes are very simalar to gaps 

The only system that will work is one designed by and for yourself.

Hello again,  
Bloodpoodle thank you for the suggestion. Will have to think about that and maybe you could post a chart with what you are trying to show me?  
I come here with a suggested gift that is FREE to all. This site took me several days to scan through all that catches your eye to look at. Click on the item of interest and inside it might show a chart with the item displayed. A yes or no can be quickly decided on many but some are very interesting to observe. I have a test chart set up to test the look and action of any indicator I want to test first before adding it to any of my charts.

Hello all traders,  
Here we are at the threshold of another weeks trading, are you ready? I last mentioned a problem I had with my BROKER, ([FXCM](/brokers/fxcm "View FXCM Broker Profile")), only with the change of account to a MINI, with limitations such as, NO EA's ALLOWED. I do not use them. And the shifting of the GMT for DAY LIGHT SAVINGS TIME, +2/+3. Which brings me to the following conclusion, "M-CANDLES" is a great indicator. My great experiment that I mentioned last week, I will not be using again. After some studying over the weekend I have added "STOCHASTIC", (12,3,3). I am trying to keep the chart clean as I can. I mention "CLEAN" because of the studying I did over the weekend. The area was "CANDLESTICK REVERSAL INDICATIONS". OK, I hear the groans because of all the mystic patterns that can be studied. Hear me out now, this person uses, 8 EMA, 20 EMA, 50 SMA, 200 SMA, along with 12 only JAPANESE CANDLE STICK PATTERS. This was a VIDEO PRESENTATION BY THE WAY. Its the MA's that clutter the charts, not saying they are not good to use, just allot of stuff. Out of all displayed and talked about I have added to my charts, STOCHASTIC, above, "PEN BARS" AND "DOJI" BARS. They fit well with GAP TRADING and DOUBLE LINE, a MA indicator. So if I am stepping on the TREAD AUTHORS TOES in this way just say stop and I will back off. MAY WE ALL GATHER MANY PIPS FROM THIS DAY FORWARD.

Hello again,  
Changed some STOP LOSS & PENDING BUY ORDERS. The 18 th is MID MONTH WED, be careful in this area. Could be an area of MAJOR SHIFT OF TREND. LOOK IN PAST MONTHS AND SEE HOW PRICES REACTED.

QUESTION: WHAT ARE THE CHANCES THAT THE NEXT DAYS BAR WILL BE IN TH SAME DIRECTION OF EITHER UP OR DOWN GAP ARROWS. ,MEANING THAT, UP ARROW HAS UP BAR, DOWN ARROW HAS DOWN BAR??? If you look at past history on any chart it might give you a better idea of the answer. It is 1:48 PST with the next DAY BAR STARTING AT 2:00 PST. In my opinion ONLY, I plan to hold, FREEZE, DO NOT BREATH. I am hoping for the continuation. If that happens I will then move my STOP LOSS TO LOCK IN ANY POTENTIAL PROFIT. GOOD LUCK TO US ALL.

Hi again,  
  
Have played with the GAP SPACE TO GET THE ARROW. This is not critical but I am experimenting a little with (50) instead of (100) for the GAP. This may bring on other GAP's showing not in the new week mode. My thought is to ignore them.  
Your choice! To me the MOVING BAR IS THE TUESDAY BAR. This requires the LONDON AND THE NY SESSIONS TO AGREE IN DIRECTION. If they do we should see a very nice move in our favor. TIME: 6:25 PST.

ANY BODY HAVING FUN YET!!!  
I will be moving STOP LOSS POSITIONS WHEN I WANT TO GO TO BED ABOUT 11:30 PST. I usually read a book until 02:00 PST, check the charts, SET THE STOPS, go to bed. Get back up at about 5:00 PST, check charts, set STOP LOSS if needed. Saw a high so far of 60.00. Here is my best position so far.

Dear ismael360,  
I am using the GAP ARROW INDICATION, starting on SUNDAY. They have combined the Sunday/Monday BAR together, the ARROW INDICATION HAS TO MATCH THE BAR, UP ARROW/UP BAR, DOWN ARROW/DOWN BAR. That is the first thing that must be satisfied. I STRONGLY BELIEVE that once that is set up the next bar to be formed for TUESDAY should complete the set up going into WED. Right now the market has acted as I hoped it would and the first pulse and profit taking has happened. I saw 60.00+ then it faded back to as low as 46.00, its now coming back again. I have raised my STOP LOSS TARGETS, some to give me a FREE TRADE, others to lessen the amount of loss should that peal back to far. NY is coming soon at 02:00 PST and I am hoping for a good jump in the same direction as my positions indicate. Here is my chart.

I have placed the following PENDING ORDERS AND TWO ACTIVE ORDERS. These are judgement calls on how the BANKS like to PUMP the BARS to MILK THEM of all they can. It knocks out SELL STOPS by the THOUSANDS. We will see how these pan out.

Hello again,  
Here are some new ACTIVE AND PENDING POSITIONS. I am pressing this chart because of my comments about GAP ARROWS giving a clue if there is a possibility that the next BAR will go in the direction the ARROW is pointing. We will see. The highest I saw last night in the BASKET was 71.00. TIME: 07:45 PST.

PART OF MYSTERY SOLVED? WED AT MIDNIGHT THEY ARE COLLECTING "ROLLOVER" money. I noticed the last few times in the "DAILY" TF that I have been getting the "ROLLOVER" amounts. By the way that was not my intention but if that helps in earning me PIP'S so be it.

GOOD MORNING ALL TRADERS: TIME: 05:45.  
WOKE UP THIS MORNING TO A 27.00+ BASKET and decided to take it to the BANK. CLOSED ALL ACTIVE POSITIONS. Still have PENDING POSITIONS IN PLACE. Here is the chart. Reason for doing this, "A BIRD IN HAND IS WORTH TWO IN THE BUSH". In the past I have let my GREED take over, "JUST A LITTLE MORE" and let nice sums slip away. The market is not going anywhere and I aim to be here for more.

This was a very profitable week. I hope you have done well also. I look forward to next week to see if the ARROWS appear. I hope you are monitoring the other thread that I am involved in also. It is because I use both this GAP THREAD idea and the other together. I have posted there my latest thoughts and mean no disrespect to this thread. Everything I do now this week will be targeted to be out before FRIDAY CLOSE PERIOD.  
Because of NEWS WED. I hope to get FAST PIPS from market reaction. MID MONTH WED. can be places of MONTHLY change of direction. BE CAREFUL IN THIS AREA! Here are my PENDING ORDERS. MAY YOU GET MANY PIPS.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

I can see I bailed out to soon on some of the charts, oh well, still took profit. Can see some not going my way on PENDING ORDERS. Made changes, check it out.

Good morning GAP TRADERS,  
Well I only have one ACTIVE TRADE left. Sure looks like it wants to drop. I will be out of the trade no matter what before FRIDAY CLOSE. TIME: 06:54 PST. Looking forward to next weeks trades, This was a profitable week. I had a few trades that did not work out but that is how the market works!  
Have a great weekend.

ALERT: This is my last position that is starting to turn positive. If it can drop thru the YELLOW LINE it could start a ROUTE to the downside. Look to the LEFT at last month. A trader could hope for the same type action to come. WE WILL SEE. TIME: 11:52 PST. NO MATTER WHAT I WILL BE OUT BY 11:00 PST FRIDAY OR EARLIER IF THERE IS A NICE PILE OF PIPS SHOWING.

TIME: 2:08 PST. NEW AND LAST BAR OF THE WEEK.  
Well here we are at the last bar of the week forming. This bar will help the BIG BOYS line up for next week. We should look for certain type bars I have mentioned in past posts, it is only two of them so no groaning. For one reason, "they work pretty well".  
I do not use the "CANDLE STICK TYPE BAR", I use the regular bar that shows the same information. I like to physically see the GAP better. In the chart shown is a "LARGE DOJI", a trader could place a BUY STOP ON THE HIGH END AND A SELL STOP ON THE LOW END WITH APPROPRIATE STOP LOSS ON BOTH ORDERS IN THE PENDING MODE. When one side fills, cancel the other.  
JUST A THOUGHT. The DOJI BAR is like a big question mark from all traders, bull or bear, trying to see which way it will go next.

TIME: 8:35 PM PST.  
Starting to look good going into the FRIDAY FORMATION BAR. Will be interesting to see how deep it goes by 0500 AM PST. I want to suggest a U TUBE VIDEO FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES: "FOREX BILLION DOLLAR DAY", this will show you how the BANKS TRADE. VERY INTERESTING!!! I hope this is not against the rules of FF.

Thank you ismael360. Not perfect but profitable. Like everyone else I have to fight with my GREED MONSTER. Something I forgot to mention about the "GAP ARROW SIZE" in color area, I use the #3 ARROW SIZE. I do this because I use the tail end of the ARROW as my "STOP LOSS PLACEMENT TO START WITH" then manually trail it with the price movement, its sort of a game of "KEEP AWAY" and I hope not to stop out to soon. What really concerns me is sometimes even waiting for the NEW BAR CHANGE TO START TUESDAY BAR, has in the past in some of the charts gone horribly wrong and continued against the arrow direction. So I plan to use two positions, one up and one down to surround the price in case it wants to break out. When one side fills I will probably drop the other.

Good Sunday to you all,  
I come to you with a gift. While looking thru my favorite FREE INDICATORS SITE, I came across this INDICATOR. You may like it or not, you decide?

Here are current positions just placed.  
ALERT: I am testing some new indicators, that is why you do not see just GAP trade setups on all of them. I wanted to be as transparent as possible so I am showing my positions for now. First response to NEW INDICATORS, some repaints horribly but is still fascinating to watch go thru its gyrations. If I showed you now it would freak you out. I will however, if asked, display one chart with all the stuff. DO NOT TRADE IT YET, PLEASE!!!

REMOVED REALLY BAD RE-PAINTER. Here is a sneak peek of what I have going on. This is the best chart of the BASKET so far. No explanation of new ARROWS yet, still testing and watching performance.

I have posted all the new chart indicators with instructions on details on the other site "NONLAGDOT". To save me some time and effort could you please go there to download them? It would be greatly appreciated. I think you will like them all. This is what the chart will look like.

Bit of a problem, platform slowed way down and stalled. Had to remove two INDICATORS to speed it back up.  
  
Removed: HILO ALARM ARROW, AND ZIGZAGFIB. Back on track.

Here is a continuation of the chart above. Once the "BUZZER" started to form the flat line the price action has stalled. I believe it is the three day holiday coming this week-end that has affected the action. Just my opinion. I did take a little profit on the last up swing. Glad I got out. Another interesting point is a new out of no where "GAP ARROW" showed up on the THURSDAY BAR.

How many brokers are out there that allow gap trading? I think at least 70% of companies forbid it, cz it might be quite risky.

[FXCM](/brokers/fxcm "View FXCM Broker Profile") does not say NO, but it is risky, they do warn you of the potential SIZE of the GAP that can happen to you.

Hello everyone,  
I am testing an indicator that has caught my eye, that is the reason for the silence. I have a gift that has been sent to me and you might like it. ENJOY!

is that true ? its just price moving .. nobody does cheat anything ..   
  
would be quite interesting to know.  
  
  
i start a small strategy on gaps as well have doubled my demo account balance in 6 days ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)   
  
however i have not loosed yet .. still try to figure out some failsafe for myself in case the gap is a go instead of retracing back ...   
  
any advice from the more experienced gap traders out there ?
