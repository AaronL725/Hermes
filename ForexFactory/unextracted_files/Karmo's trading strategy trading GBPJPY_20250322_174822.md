Hi all,  
  
I'm going to explain the strategy I use to trade GJ and I'm going to be posting my weekly/daily analysis of this pair.  
  
I don't use anything fancy, I use some basic stuff that most traders use and some common sense ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
The indicators I use are:

  1. Fibonacci retracement levels
  2. Trendlines/Channels
  3. 5 period simple MA
  4. Candlestick patterns
  5. Support/Resistance levels
  6. Momentum

As you can see it's all simple and basic stuff except maybe for the fibonacci retracement, because every trader could use it differently. If you have any doubts about any of the stuff I use, either ask or just do a simple google search and you'll find plenty of information about them.  
  
Using the fibonacci retracement on different timeframes (1H, 4H, Daily, Weekly) is very important, because sometimes some of them overlap and that tells us where we might find strong support/resistance. I'll post some examples.  
  
If you have been following my posts on Auslanco's thread, you will know that we use the 5SMA for a good entry point when a retracement occurs (Thank you Auslanco).  
  
Most of the time, I trade based on the 4H chart, but I keep an eye on the daily chart and sometimes the weekly chart. I use the 1H chart for a good entry point. Any TF less than 1H has a lot of noise and it is very risky trading GJ on very small TF's.  
  
Using stop-loss, I always wait for my trade to go in my direction for about 50-100 pips before I move my SL and lock in a very small # of pips (10) and then just let it run until it reaches my TP, this way I don't let a winning trade turn into a losing one, and if my SL gets hit, no worries coz +10 is way better than anything negative ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Momentum & 5sma  
Before using the Momentum indicator and 5sma, you must have auslanco's QQE indicator. I'll explain how to catch a retracement in this following example:  
When QQE 4h is crossed upwards, and QQE 1hr is crossed upwards, and the Momentum at the beginning of the next 1h candle is pointing downwards, price will usually retrace to 1hr 5sma, it's that simple.

Here's a chart showing the monthly chart, I've drawn 2 trendlines that shows us a nice channel, this past week price got very close to the lower trendline and it bounced back up. I have also drawn a monthly fibo retracement, we will have to wait until the end of the month and see where we close, but you get an idea of where the monthly fibo levels are

Monthly = Green fibo levels  
Weekly = Blue fibo levels  
  
Looking at the weekly chart now, we can see the price opened the past week just below the 23.6% fibo and went through the 38.2%, 50% and touched the 61.8% but it came back and closed just above the 50%. Plus you can see the 23.6% monthly fibo and the weekly 50% fibo are very close to each other, this should be a good support level. The candle has broken and closed below the weekly lower trendline.

Daily = Pink fibo levels  
  
If you look closely, you can see how the price went to the next daily fibo level after it broke and closed well below a level. we had a full retracement on the daily chart this past week. The last candle we have on the daily is a hammer/pin-bar/doji, whatever you want to call it.., price tried to break the weekly fibo's but it failed and it closed just above the 50%. To me this indicates that price will go up to the 231-232 area to test the fibonacci levels we have there.. we'll know next week ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

4H = Black fibo levels  
  
Don't get confused with all the colorful lines, if you are then open up your chart and just plot 1 fibo at a time and look how price bounced off the fibo levels.  
  
I drew this fibo retracement level after I saw it not being able to test the low again, we can see how the price went and tested the 23.6% the first time and failed, but it broke it the 2nd attempt and went straight to the 38.2%, where it was rejected and came back to the 23.6%, It is going to test the 38.2% another time.. next week. We are also in a small downtrend channel.

The chart you posted here illustrates the reason I've never used Fib.  
  
By picking a different swing low to draw the fib from, you can make the retracement be anything you want it to be.  
  
Maybe you have an objective set of rules for making the choice. That would be good.

First of all, a big HELLO to everybody coz as you can see this is my first post in FF.  
  
To be honest, I was waiting for a personal thread like that by this great trader and person like Karmo.  
  
I'm watching,reading and trying to follow for some time the other thread (Auslanco's...) but only as a guest.Without participating or even replying to anything.  
  
I believe that I'm not ready yet to participate coz I need to learn more and more things about that wonderful world...The ''world of FOREX''...  
  
I wish some day to become a trader like u guyz!!!  
  
Keep up the good work and I wish to everybody a mountain of pipz...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)!!! 

Vivere pericolosamente...

I said in my first post that every trade could and will draw his fibonacci retracement different. I use the monthly/weekly just to get an idea of where price might be heading, I mostly concentrate on the daily and 4H charts since I trade everyday.  
  
I draw my fibs from the top of a bear run until it stops and retracement starts, and from the bottom of a bull run till it stops and starts to retrace. You'll know more what I mean when I post my 4H charts everyday.

Hi Karmo,  
  
Very good charts and I see your calls are very accurate on the Ausco thread.  
  
Now I did post on the mentioned thread that I blew my account last week, however prior to this 2000 pip drop I used exactly your method to treble my account from January this year to July 20th as I was following the daily chart trend.  
  
So I know your system works I can prove that.  
  
The BIG question is which timeframe to use to determine the trend. This is absolutely crucial as the reason I blew my account was that all the strong Fib retracement levels on the Daily Charts never held. Ok my Money management could have been better so lesson learnt, however I would have still had a large drawdrawn at best.  
  
I took a wild punt on Friday and made 900 pips from the low because we hit the Weekly trendline channel. Now if I was looking at a weekly timeframe I probably would have doubled my account instead of blowing it.  
  
SO HOW OR WHICH TIMEFRAME DO WE USE FOR THE TREND BECAUSE IF ITS NOT KNOW YOU CAN HAVE TWO CONFLICTING VIEWS ON DIRECTION... THIS IS HOW I BLEW MY ACCOUNT  
  
Regards  
Dave  
  
PS To all newbies... If you follow the trend (what is it? + use multiple fib levels) you can make some serious money

Hi fourxtrader,  
  
Regarding your question about the 5SMA, this was never part of my method until I came across Auslanco and his method, as he says that it is the 'true price', since I started using the 5SMA to enter the market, it has given me a much much better entry price than I would of entered before. Whenever a retracement starts, watch how price reacts to the 5SMA on every TF, from 5mins to 1H, price keeps testing the 5SMA on every TF until one of them supports/holds, but most of the time it will retrace to the 1H SMA, and it depends on how strong the current movement is.  
  
If I didn't answer your question, please do ask me again.

Hi rumbey,  
  
What is the trend? well, it depends on which timeframe you are looking at, there are so many trends within trends. I recommend looking at 2-3 different timeframes rather than just one TF. Like I said in a post above, I use the weekly/monthly fibonacci levels to have an idea of where price might go. The daily fibo's didn't hold but the weekly held, where we also had a trendline there as well.  
  
I'm sorry to hear about blowing up your account, but a question came to my mind, were you not using a 'stop-loss'? Trading GJ and without a stop-loss, it will turn into a disaster. Money Management is very very very important as well. Don't worry I blew up my first account trading this beast also, so you're not alone. 

Trade what you see, not what you think.

Thanks Karm. I have been having a difficult time in applying FIB's to my charts. Now I have an idea. In applying a FIB's to weekly and daily, how do you determine which high / low's to apply them to?

Like I said in a post above, I use the weekly/monthly fibonacci levels to have an idea of where price might go. The daily fibo's didn't hold but the weekly held, where we also had a trendline there as well.

This was my problem. As the price retraced on the daily the trend was still UP on the daily therefore you look for a retracement off the fib lines to go LONG. My stop is usually 200 below, but on several occasions because the fib lines are approximate areas or support/resistance I let the losses run too much. Then the same on the 50% and the 61.8%.  
  
Because the trend is still UP its very dangerous to SHORT the market although looking back its clear but as we all know its not at all clear at the time you are trading.  
  
Ironically, when I posted I was long last week everyone was saying that the trend is DOWN, but is it? Maybe I need to trade the 4hr and just keep an eye on the other timeframes.. How do you determine the EXACT trend?  
  
So how do you determine if you are going to go long or short just by looking at the fibs.  
  
Presently you could draw fib lines from the low to high AND high to low. Which fibs will you TRUST because they conflict unless you know the overall trend direction... Are you clear what I am trying to say?

On the daily/weekly TF, I usually look for the last major retracement we had and then draw from there. For example, on the daily GJ I've drawn from the low of 221.xx to the high of 251.xx, and this week we had 100% retracement. so if on monday we don't test the low again, I'm going to draw a fib from the high of 251.xx to the low of 219.xx, and that will give us the fibs of how high will it retrace from here (resistance levels)

Plus you can see the 23.6% monthly fibo and the weekly 50% fibo are very close to each other, this should be a good support level. The candle has broken and closed below the weekly lower trendline.

Hi Karmo,   
  
First, I truly appreciate you putting this together and posting in a new thread and thus sharing your strategy with all of us. This is invaluable to and we can't thank you enough (same applies to Aus as well.)  
  
Could you plese explain how you determine the low and how points for drawing your Fibs. 'Cause I notice that your lowpoint (100%) on this weekly fib is 200.52 while one could have drawn it with the low near 192 or the one near 189 as well. How do you determine which is more appropriate.  
  
Thanks in advance.  
  
~G.

The daily trend was up, why would you long at every retracement level when the daily candle clearly broke the fibo level? you should wait for the daily candle to close to see whether the fibo level will hold or not.  
Even on other timeframes, I wait for the candle to close convincingly below/above any fibo level before considering it being broken, plus sometimes the price will come back and test the fibo level it broke.  
  
The daily chart shows a 100% retracement, if on monday we make a newer low, I'll consider the daily to be in a downtrend, but it would make more sense to me if price went up because looking at the weekly chart, it retraced to the 61.8 which price usually does before resuming it's trend (Upward based on weekly).  
  
About drawing the fib from low/high or high/low, that depends whether it is a bull-run (upward movement) or bear-run (downward movement)  
If price has risen from 221 to 251, you will draw the fibo from low to high, which it will tell you how low will it retrace before resuming it's trend.  
If the price has fell from 251 to 219, you will draw the fibo from the high to low, which it will tell you how high it might retrace before resuming it's trend. Remember if it retraces 100% then that fib and close well below 100% retracement is nomore valid because it would mean we're getting into a new trend.  
  
The daily fib we have now shouldn't be considered but I will wait for monday to close without making a new low, then draw a new daily fib from high to low, which will give us the levels of how high it might retrace. Remember weekly trend is still up and it completed the 61.8% fibo, we could be going higher than 251 in the coming weeks based on weekly chart.  
  
I hope I have answered your question. 

Trade what you see, not what you think.

So in other words the trend is now SHORT on the Daily, and all other TF's except the Weekly and Monthly?? If you trade off the weekly you are saying that the 50% fib has hit therefore we go LONG (always trade with the trend)   
  
OR  
  
Daily = TREND DOWN therefore we look to SHORT at say the 61.8% Fib level  
  
This is where the confusion lies??  
  
My only solution is do you need to take into account Fundamentals to decide if you are LONG or SHORT. You can't be both!  
  
  
You MUST be Long as you expect the price to rise to the Daily 61.8%?? which doesn't make sense. You should be short from the failure of Fridays price to break this level?

Hi AlphaGA,  
  
We are all here to learn, aren't we? we don't need to thank each other ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
I totally know what you are saying and it is indeed very hard to draw a 100% accurate fibo level, especially on longer timeframes such as the weekly. I had a hard drawing this fib on the weekly myself, I just decided to draw it from the 200 point since it a nice uptrend move started from there. I have drawn from the points you mentioned, and it gets even more interesting, we will have to keep an eye and see which one is going to be the more appropriate one.

If you draw the weekly from low at 165.37 on 6/3/01 then this weeks low was more or less on the 38.2% fib so a valid signal as well

Basically on current price you are either:  
  
LONG with stop 50 pips below the 38.2% fib   
  
or  
  
SHORT with stop above (+50pips) the 61.8% fib  
  
You shouldn't have any stops within these ranges. These stops should keep you clear of any whipsawing. There is nothing worse in my opinion apart from loosing a trade than losing your position due to a stop being too close  
  
Do you agree Karmo?

I don't trade relying on the fib levels only, I use candlestick patterns as well. we are still in an uptrend channel on the monthly, and we have a nice pin-bar/doji/hammer on the daily chart, I expect the price to go up.  
  
I trade on the 4H chart, I could go long and short in the same day and make a good amount of pips, I just use the daily/weekly for confirmation and like i said to have an idea of the bigger picture.

What about stop loss levels.. Do you use pivots and daily support/resistance levels?  
  
I use MT4 with daily pivots etc plotted if anyone is interested in using these on MT4 platform. I can post them here  
  
I also use trailing stops minimum 100 behind but more often I place stop above/below the next fib level +50 or a daily resistance/support line

Hi Karmo - My first post, too. But I've been trading with FF constantly for the past two months, especially Aus thread. THANK YOU! Thank you for this thread, and for the amazing help you've given me in my trading. I'm not the first to say this, certainly not the last. I look forward to studying your method, and applying it to my steep learning curve. Thanks also to Auslanco, Markham, and others who give generously of their time and knowledge.

I am a total newbie at Forex trading or any kind of trading whatsoever, so what I am about to say maybe completely of target or worse plain stupid, I had a moment or two to decide if to post or not but here it goes:  
\- All that I know about Fibbonaci retracement is what Iâve read on babypics and from seeing your charts.  
\- But what I do know is that price moves in waves, impulse/correction waves, and every wave has its smaller compounding waves on smaller TF hence the different so called trends. In my view to have a good fibonaci you just have to catch a wave from start to end dead on.   
\- The weekly chart is the one that caused me a lot of head ackes, where to start it from, and like AlpahGA very well pointed out, you have different start points(swing lows). Then it came to my mind that price is only set by people perception of it, but what do they perceive? Except from the levels that represent round numbers, 220.00 for example, where do the rest of the levels come from? My simplest response would be that they come from previous fibonaci retracement levels (that we know they work) so price stopped there a lot of times before moving on so we have many intersections so we have levels, if the logic is correct should work the other way around, so to catch a wave we only have to know it started after beating a level. so the fibs should be from that level on. In our case on weekly we have at least 3 important start levels: 200.52(your fib), 192.61, 189.50.  
\- To put it short, a good fib in my view should start from the levels with most intersections, by only looking back at these 3 levels I can see that 192.61 is the best level to choose for the fib to start.  
\- If you find that I have at least came close to something useful we could ask Que to write a software for to decide which level in a designated area has the most intersection and work from there onâ¦, if you find it total rubbish and that I missed some key points about fib drawing just delete my post, and suggest some good reading for me.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

Hello Karmo, congrats for your new thread as its very very valuable for all newbie. I have been following your call for 2 weeks and I always impressed with the result. Last week, you are absolutely a Knigth Bear Green Pips as I didn't see anyone that put their target as low as you did.  
  
When you open position, do you always let the SL blank ? and will lock in + 10 pips after the market go in your direction for 50 pips? Just curious to know, and maybe this is a stupid question as your decision is 90% right, but how about the market go against you before the 50 pips occurs? I ask this question since my capital is so little.  
  
I don't see any line of 5 SMA in all charts.  
  
Congratulation again

Hi Karmo,  
  
Happy to see that you have started this thread after watching you performing an excellent analysis and highly successful GJ trades for some time through Auslanco thread.  
  
I am wondering if you like to keep the chart analysis from your end or don't mind some input from others?

I'm agree with input from others but not strategy from others. This will be confiusing newbie like me. If other people want to show their strategy, just create their OWN THREAD. Its better i think.

I have never used Pivot Points, read about them a little but I was never interested in them, dunno why.  
  
As for SL, I will usually put my stop-loss 100-200 pips or somewhere around resistance/support levels or at fib levels, it depends on the situation. But as soon as I am in profit of 50-100 pips, I'll lock in a small # of pips and let it ride, it's a free trade from there onwards ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Hi cornelius2,  
  
Thanks, green pips is my new GF ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
Regarding the SL, check post #42  
  
As for the 5 SMA, I use it mostly on 1H and 4H charts when I'm trading, use them for entry.. check Auslanco's thread for how to use it, and I'll explain it once this trading week starts.. you'll understand better ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Halla Majd,  
  
Thanks bro, I don't mind anyone posting their charts with some fib action going on.. I'd love to see what everyone else is seeing on their charts ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

I've been doing analysis on the DOW since it's been very correlated with GJ lately, I would love to post but this last friday the broker didn't update the friday candles for the DOW for some reason, once the broken opens on Monday and updates their chart, I'll post.

Hi Karmo,  
  
I too wanted to voice my thanks in your willingness to share your method. I've been very impressed with your calls whilst watching Auslanco's thread and will no doubt learn tons of stuff. I made 700 pips from yours and Aus's call last friday (on my demo though as I'm still learning ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) but gosh that was really kewl). For a newbie like me, its a privledge to learn from such experienced traders.  
  
Looking forward to learning your trading strategies. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60e.png?v=15.1)

Thank you for your lesson for the said pair. You use 1H TF for entry. May I ask how long the whole transaction take? If the market turns against you, would you normally lock-up your position to clear your mind?  
How about the pair USD/JPY ? would you use the same trading strategy?  
Thank you.

Thanks Karmo,  
  
So once a trade in locked in for say 10 pips do you use trailing stops or just leave it to hit you first fib level target  
  
Also how do you go about trading once your target is met. (i presume at a fib level) Do you close and then wait for a 4 hr candle to close above the fib and trade again or ??? Can you explain  
  
I sometimes find it difficult to reverse on a fib level or not. Do you have a system in place for this scenario?

Hi woowk08,  
  
It depends, I don't really think of how long it will take, I set my SL and TP and enjoy my time, I'll usually lock in a small # of pips like i've said before.  
Ofcourse you can use the same method on any pair, but I rather concentrate on one and master it rather than trade so many different pairs and get confused. 

Trade what you see, not what you think.

The broker I use doesn't have a trailing stop, after locking in some pips I let the trade do it's thing until the 4H candle closes, if it looks like it has the power to reach my TP, then it's fine but if it looks like it's getting exhausted, i'll just move my SL manually and lock in some more profits.  
  
Are we getting greedy Rumbey? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
I do wait for the 4H candle to close and re-evaluate everything, waiting for a good set-up and trade again.  
  
Reverse on a fib level? what do you mean? 

Trade what you see, not what you think.

What I mean is more often than not price bounces off fib as on Friday (61.8%) fib.   
  
How do you deal with this situation because the 4hr chart is still trending DOWN so logically that would have been a good position to short with 200+pips in the bag already.  
  
Or do you expect usually a fib level to be challenged more than once and if it fails a second time you reverse?

It depends on how the candlestick forms, price will not always come back and test the fibo level, that is why I have used Auslanco's 5SMA because price always retraces back to 5SMA on the 1H and it gives us a good entry point.  
  
I don't know how many times will a fib be tested, I just trade what I see on my chart.  
  
The 4H is indeed in a downtrend, but before it resumes downwards it has to retrace, I'll post some charts in a bit. 

Trade what you see, not what you think.

This is how I have set up my charts for Monday's trading, these fibo levels are valid unless we make a new low but I doubt it.  
  
Daily:  
  
<http://img254.imageshack.us/img254/5053/gjeg2.gif>  
  
  
4H:  
  
<http://img154.imageshack.us/img154/2605/gjea6.gif>  
  
  
Now here's both fib's on the same chart.. both fib levels show us how much will price retrace before resuming downtrends, if price breaks 61.8% fib level and closes above it, then the trend might be changing.. for now it's down

Karm,  
  
My mentor and best bud...lol How did I do on my fibs? the blue (active) the grey (for different time frame) this is for 1hr chart. I will post the indicator if you wish to look but it sets the fibs in all time frames by it self.  
  
Well I will get the hang of posting better charts soon I hope.

Hi Kevin,  
  
Honestly, I don't know where is the starting point of the fib, nor where is the end point, if you could post a much better chart and without all those indicators, and maybe zoom out a bit..please ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Karm,  
  
I don't know what the deal is here but I for the life of me can not get a chart posted as I see it. I will have to try another software for posting charts. Outside of you looking at those indicators, I will do it by hand as you have listed.  
Not being able to post what I am seeing as I see it is really pissin me off.

There is an indicator called Zigzag, which can be useful to determine the points for the fibs. Or also.. Fractals can be used.  
Good luck with the thread ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Good job Kevin, they look great ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
  
Excellent trendlines and fib combination going on there ovidiu, I like the weekly fib and that lower trendline, interesting area to watch, and we are indeed in a downtrend channel on the 4H chart

No positions open, if you want to keep track of the positions I open, you should follow Auslanco's thread in the 'Forex discussion' because that's the place where I hang out with my fellow traders during trading sessions ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60e.png?v=15.1)

Testing first post. Note; I did the same exact thing,,, I looked at each timeframe and each one next to the other was almost always opposite the one next to it, with a couple of neutral ones, I didn't force the trade, but with all the same indicators ya'll use I put down my best estimate with tight (maybe too tight) sl's and still managed to kill a good portion of my account when I didn't have this kind of trouble in the demo.....ouchee

nice job you're doing here, karmo.  
i use the same strategy, with 2 exceptions: i don't use pivots, and i only enter trades confirmed by divergences (both types, classical and hidden...).  
i use a zup indicator (i think it's v67) to have my fibo levels automatically drawn on the chart; as for the divergences, macd histogram works great for me.  
keep up the good work!

here it is (_you need to allow dll imports_).  
i don't pay attention to the blue patterns (you'll see them from time to time) unless they have fibo ratios (i'm talking about gartley, butterfly, crab etc - google should guide you to these if you're interested...). there is a discussion thread at tsd, you can also get more info there. basically you look at the dotted lines and when you see a fibo ratio (.618, .786 etc) you look for a reversal pattern. combine this with divergences and you have a very good system.

Hi Karmo, I made more than $ 400 yesterday because of your fibo training. Your charts was very clear and easy to follow.  
  
In my weekly chart, I see trend line point to 230 this week and so does fibo 23.6. But it seems GJ will test the 220 level again before it climbs up, just like a moment in March 2007.  
  
Thank you again Karmo. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

I have been following Auses thread for quite a while and am grateful you have started your own. My question is how do you get the prices to show up on your fibo lines. I am using Meta Trader 4. Thanks again

Hi Karmostaji, first nice trade on the GPP/JPY, I wanted to swing trade the same peak but I already had some other trades open so I had to pass this one. I've observed the 4H and Daily charts for you and price is doing fine on both. I uploaded the charts. Your only fear should be if price forms a mini down trend which hits your stoploss....  
  
Other than that, the overall trend here is up, price reached down to a low peak and has bounced back up..  
  
7ayak allah!

Karmostaji,  
  
I follow the other thread quite closely and have noticed that you have a fibo line at 232.61 (61.8). I have been able to learn how to draw the fibo lines and for some reason I do not have a line there. How did you determine where to draw your line from. I thought I had it figured out. Here is what my chart looks like. Any guidance you can give me would be great.

hi karmo,  
  
if there is a new swing high or low, so i have to draw new fib lines, the older are still in work? do they still work with same strongness? - or does it depent on timeframe how long they are strong?  
question over question, hope you find time to answer.  
  
best wishes, take care

Here's the daily chart with the fibs, the first try to break the 50% level failed, we might be going for another try and if it successfully breaks, we will see 238.80 which is my 2nd TP.

based on the 4H, we retraced 50% of the bull run and then started heading back up, seems like we're testing the 23.6% again.. I'm expecting price to rise to 235.50

I have been able to learn how to draw the fibo lines and for some reason I do not have a line there. How did you determine where to draw your line from. I thought I had it figured out. Here is what my chart looks like. Any guidance you can give me would be great.

Right after you put on the fibo lines a properties window will open up...click on Fibo Levels tab...0 should show in the left coulumn under Level...0.0 should show in the right column under Description. Click on add or default in order to get the 0.0 to show. I can't remember just how to do it and I don't want to play with my own too much...sometimes MT4 is tricky and I'm concerned about getting things back the way I want them. Hope this helps.

Looking at my charts, we will have a big fall next week..   
  
Weekly chart:  
  
I don't remember what we call this last candle but it is a sign of a big fall  
  
<http://img105.imageshack.us/img105/9029/gjvr1.gif>  
  
  
Daily chart:  
  
On the daily chart, we have completed 50% retracement as you can see   
  
  
<http://img167.imageshack.us/img167/2357/gjog0.gif>  
  
  
4H chart:  
  
We are in a nice downtrend channel, and if we take the fib from 244 to the low of 219, we have completed 61.8% retracement, so to me we should be heading downwards from here..

karmo, i already explained on aus' thread the candlestick pattern.   
here is again the weekly chart.  
you probably think that what you saw is a hanging man (because you expect a fall judging by that candle...). it's not a hanging man because there is no previous uptrend. it's not enough for a candle to look like something, but more important is WHERE is located and IF there is a confirmation.   
actually, the weekly chart shows a piercing pattern (which might suggest a reversal from the last big fall, so we should see the trend resuming UP, not down). except that this piercing pattern has not been confirmed yet; this week should have been closed ABOVE last bullish candle.   
now let's talk about the downside: for this piercing pattern to be negated, g-j needs to go at least below 219.31 (either a lower low, but i would need to see a close below this level). only in this case the downtrend will resume.  
now something else... that candle also look like another pattern reversal: a hammer (a hanging man and a hammer look exactly the same, it's just their location that is different). we might assume it would be a hammer because it is located in a downtrend... but that would also be considered as a reversal sign. now let's put it all together: downtrend... then piercing pattern... then something that looks like a hammer... i would say that weekly chart does not support AT ALL a big fall. at least, not until these patterns are negated.  
h4 and daily, on the other side, do suggest a fall to some extent. which is all that matters for me now, because i'm not trading weekly candles on g-j.  
  
regarding the daily chart, yes, we had a 50% retracement from the whole drop and a 61.8% retracement from the last swing. it should be enough to make us watch for a reversal. add the reverse divergence on major oscillators and the picture is pretty suggestive. however, daily chart does not show a valid reversal pattern (and i'm talking about a candlestick pattern) yet.  
  
the most bearish looking chart is h4. i'm not going below h4. that's just noise.

Weekly analysis:  
  
Weekly chart:  
  
As I had predicted that last week would be a bear week and it indeed turned out to be so, now looking at the weekly fibonacci levels, GJ is looking to retest the 50%, 61.8% and even touching 76.4% which is 212.45 area, the weekly chart is still bullish unless we get a weekly bar closing below the lower TL, then things will change but in my prediction we will touch the 76.4% in the coming weeks  
  
<http://img509.imageshack.us/img509/1134/gjmw1.gif>  
  
  
Daily chart:  
  
As we have seen in the past weeks, GJ retraced 50% of the move down and it has started to resume it's bearish trend now. The last day of the week, the candle closed well below the 38.2% fibonacci level, the next level is the 23.6% which is also close to the weekly 50%  
  
<http://img295.imageshack.us/img295/526/gjst9.gif>  
  
  
4H chart:  
  
Looking at the Green fibs, we completed 61.8% retracement and price has started to resume it's bearish trend. I also added the orange fibs, all these fibonacci are good levels to keep an eye on, the beast will take a rest at some of these levels like it did at the 76.4% (orange)  
  
<http://img172.imageshack.us/img172/9167/gjwk0.gif>  
  
  
so, in simple words.. I also see 212 in the coming weeks/month ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Usually if it retraces to 61 it retraces all the way to 100.

Another way  
  
Save as picture - on desktop

quick and easy.

Click on add or default in order to get the 0.0 to show. I can't remember just how to do it and I don't want to play with my own too much...sometimes MT4 is tricky and I'm concerned about getting things back the way I want them. Hope this helps.

when you set a MT4 indicator the way you like it save it under another name ie PTB fib 1  
that way you can play with other variations.  
  
best way to do this is to save the file and open an identical chart and add the renamed indicator. jsu to check the saved file works the same way.

Thanks for all your work on this Karmo.  
I really appreciate it. I don't usually trade GJ but EJ instead, but the trends are virtually itendtical so it's been helpful to read your input.

Greetings Karmo  
  
I'm amazed at the way you do trading. I'm new in this line, tho' been learning since Feb07, i'm yet to discover more. Its interesting to learn about GJ and i as i've been following your thread only recently, im beginning to notice that all tips are great.. Hence, i shall keep coming here for more and is there anyway i can contact you on YM. Thnks very much and may God bless you!  
  
quote=karmostaji;1546483]I said in my first post that every trade could and will draw his fibonacci retracement different. I use the monthly/weekly just to get an idea of where price might be heading, I mostly concentrate on the daily and 4H charts since I trade everyday.  
  
I draw my fibs from the top of a bear run until it stops and retracement starts, and from the bottom of a bull run till it stops and starts to retrace. You'll know more what I mean when I post my 4H charts everyday.[/quote]

This past week was excellent, hopefully next week will be better and with bigger move since the Fed is going to have a little party with us lol ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
  
Ok, let's get to analyzing..  
After learning about the great Moving Averages (50ema, 100sma, 200ema) from our MA master 'Hakuna Matata', I have drawn my weekly fibonacci levels differently this week (weekly chart) and I will explain to you why.  
  
As we know, Moving Averages provide Support/Resistance levels, so now have a look at the chart and see how nicely price reacted (I'm amazed!). Now let's add some Fibo's to our cocktail, the 200ema acted as a support (it barely touched it, but I'll take it as support) on 17/07/05 , now if you draw a Fibonacci retracement from this low to the high of 251.07  
  
<http://img405.imageshack.us/img405/1646/gjij9.gif>  
  
Now look at that 100sma and 50% level, they were both close to each other and price bounced off that area perfectly. I said last week 212 is next on the cards for GJ but I'll change it to 212-214, since our 61.8% fibo is at 215 and 200ema is just below it, 212-214 should be achieavable in the coming weeks/months.  
  
Remember now, we have lots of supports to break before getting there.. I don't trade based on weekly charts, I just have them in order to have an idea of where price might go next. 

Trade what you see, not what you think.

Daily chart:  
  
That descending TL from the top has been acting as a support lately, but I believe it will be broken and next support area for GJ based on the daily chart is the 23.6% fibo level.

4H chart:  
  
The price has been bouncing off the green 61.8%, 50%, and 38.2% fibo levels, once price breaks the 38.2% + TL (close to my 2nd TP), 23.6% is next where we also have a weekly TL waiting for us there.

so are you thinking the previous resistance has become it's new support in a continued down trend?  
looking on the weekly it looks like consolidation. but on H4 and H1 looks like still down.

Hi Karmo. Nice analysis. I was just curious as to why you used mid july to take the weekly fibs from rather than January, is there a specific rule that you use.  
Thanks, Bogus.

The weekly chart has been the most difficult one to drawn proper fibs on, I do not rely on the weekly much since I'm an intra-day trader.

For the past 2 weeks or so, price has been bouncing off the 38.2%, 50%, and 61.8% fib levels on the 4h chart, we also have a triangle, once it breaksout.. we will have a clear direction. 200ema (red line) has been a good resistance.

GJ has broken to the upside as we know but we have a very strong resistance at 235.20-45, if this resistance is broken then 238 is definitely a target. A 50% retracement is possible first to 233.70 area where we also have 50ema.

Daily chart is very bullish, so is the 4H, price completed it's daily 61.8% retracement from it's last fall to 219 area. Where will price go next? It could retrace back to the daily 50% fibo to see if it supports or not, or it could still go higher, the trendline is still supporting this upward trend, I wouldn't short this pair unless the TL gets broken and retracement for this last upward movement starts. I've also drawn a new fibo for this last daily swing (assuming this is the top, otherwise this fibo is invalid), you can see the 38.2% fibo (green) is very to close to the daily 50%, so it could retrace to that area and then bounce back up or it could retrace to it's favorite fibo level which is the 50%. This week should be interesting and lots of pips for us to grab. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60e.png?v=15.1)

Go ahead kenneith, but I hope you have looked at the 15m strategy thread itself first.

Draw the fibo retracement, then double click on it, then right click and choose 'fibo properties', and change the color, click ok

All of these are in auslanco's 15m strategy thread, look in the first pages, the indicators are there, you might just have to adjust the values only.

add the fib to your chart  
once added, place you cursor over it and it will give you a fib number.  
right click on chart and open object list  
find fib, usually if it's the last item you have added it will be near the bottom of the list.  
click on fib number and select edit, you will then be able to change the colours, common tab and fibo levels both have there own colour options.  
  
you can also change the line thickness  
  
see how you get on

oh thank you very much  
  
actually, i wanted for a log time to get this, and today, i get it by myself immediately after posting for a help.  
  
i set into tool options to display properties immediately after creating an object.  
  
your method works too but right clicking on the diagonal fibo not on the levels  
  
take care

It's been a while since I talked about my lovely fibs..  
  
From the last move up on 4h chart, you can see the price retraced 50% and went back up to 23.6% and now it's back close to 50% again. I still believe there is one more push up left to 240.50 area before the major reversal most of us are waiting for.

Hey Karmo. there are just a few hours remaining to the end of the week and I can see the possibility of a "doji" candle forming on the GBPJPY weekly chart. Is this a sign of a pending major reversal or a sign that this pair is just beginning to loose its bullish steam? On the daily chart I also see that 239.60ish has been a tough one to crack.   
Any new suggestions on what to expect in the next coming days?

You have to allow dll imports for the indicator to work. And if you recognise the fib numbers while observing divergences you will have a high probabilty trade. Else you may end up your sl being hit most of the time. therefore just don't rely only on this indicator to trade imo.

i have also explained this on auslanco's thread: if you look at weekly chart, the last high (240.66) was not that close to a fib ratio (i wanted to see either 0.618, or 0.707/0.786, not the plain 0.67 that is now). this suggests the move up is not over yet.  
the dip we have just seen it is mostly a retracement, and it looks like it has come to and end. i thought it would be over at 235.90, but it wasn't; so i'm waiting to see what's going on at 234.43... and if this one is broken, then 232.96 (it is possible... but in this chart configuration, unlikely).  
next move should be up, to somewhere between 238 to 239; i would think it should go higher, to 241.76 or 244.27, to close the weekly fib. and then big time drop... or up again.  
how am i doing, karmo?

It seems the majority are having the bear fever for this week and they could be correct, but I don't have that fever yet. On the daily chart, after the price reached the 61.8% which we have been waiting for, it was rejected and price has come back down to the 50% (235.20). If we draw a new fibo (green) from the last bull-run from the breakout we had 2 weeks ago, the 50% fibo is right on the daily one and price is current around there, but it could still dip to 61.8% (233.90) area before bouncing back up and most probably going to 243.50 area. Remember, if we get a sell-off or panic selling then everything I just said is useless, so just be careful and don't jump the gun, have patience and wait for confirmation before pulling the trigger, good luck.

I hope everyone had a good weekend, and ready to grab more pips from the beast ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
Daily chart:  
  
Here's a simple looking daily chart with 2 trendlines and a fibo retracement, you can see we have been bouncing off those fibo levels and trendlines, price is close to the 50% level, which way are we going next? hmm It can go either way and a breakout should happen soon (this week maybe), so keep your eyes on the chart and don't miss out on the fun ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
  
<http://img137.imageshack.us/img137/2935/gjeb3.gif>  
  
  
  
4H chart:  
  
Ok, let's look at the recent fall we had from 240 area to the 230 area, the price has retraced 50% and then back down to 23.6%, now we're back up close to 50%, what's next? The chart says it all, a breakout should be coming up soon this week.

GJ should be heading towards the bottom of this uptrend channel (235 area), and then possible resuming uptrend towards 238 area.. but we'll have to see if the lower trendline supports or not. I'm short from 236.60 with SL at +1 already.

Price seems to be heading to the support area of 223.70 but before it gets there we could see some kind of small retracement first. If that support gets broken, then we should be seeing 222. I expect good support in the 222-223 area because we have a monthly trendline there also.

Karmo, do you see this thing heading to the much anticipated 230-232 level that a lot of ppl have been talking about? I am just curious with some much talk of about it some times rumours can mislead newbies

In terms of picking a time frame for direction, larger time frame usually trumps smaller one; basically you have to trade when both time frames are going in same direction.Without proper money management, you WILL blow your account orsuffer serious drawdowns as you mentioned. If you're still thinking in terms of "double my account vs. blowing it", you will blow it sooner rather than later. I would humbly recommend trading less of your account and/or using tighter stops to protect your capital. PROTECT YOUR CAPITAL AT ALL COSTS!!!In forex, you have to think 3 steps forward, 2 steps back, always...You should NEVER risk blowing your account on 1 or even several trades in a row.

Since I trade medium term now (weeks), I look at weekly/daily charts and trade, so here's my analysis of GJ. IMO a good retracement is due, atleast to the famous 50% which is 223, where a strong support was broken and never tested again, so it should be a very strong resistance now. The weekly QQE is also at the bottom of it's range, very very close to oversold area. I like to keep things simple and stupid. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

You may be keeping it simple and clean, but it is far from being stupid. I would say "brilliant". I like how you pointed out how that 223-224 (at the 50 fib area) . . strong support and never tested then act as resistence.   
Makes sense to me. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Hallo Karmostaji!  
  
I am with you on the retracement. Maybe I will bail out with my profits a bit earlier, but I will surely have the patience to see the little butterfly take off. In fact the pattern is so large, that I had to get the compression up to make it digestable.  
  
Let's see when it comes to its fruition!  
  
See ya!

I have seen this bullish pattern for several weeks now and it is not an ideal pattern but I still keep it at the back of my mind, a good retracement is due IMO.

My view of GJ hasn't changed, I still thinking we will see 217 and if we are lucky, we might see 223 area before resuming downwards again. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Price is currently retracing from it's last move down, I believe the retracement might be over at 50% (208.47) or 61.8% (209.65) before it starts the next leg down towards the the monthly 50% (199.63), but I'm waiting for confirmation from the new weekly momentum, I'll confirm it once I get it.

Hi webstakes,

As long as price is above the 4H Gann hilo, bulls are in control for now.  
I'm waiting for the new weekly momentum, we'll get it in a couple of hours.

Hey karmo, Just an observation and question to consider. Could the the retrace already be fullfilled to the 38.2 ? Could the weight of the down trend be so great that it could only retrace partially to the 50fib, which was only 60 pips away?

It is very much possible, I'll hold onto my longs until I see a 4H candle and 4H QQE cross down because that will signal that the next down leg is starting. I'm also expecting the new weekly momentum to be very bearish and we could see 199 area easily, I'll wait and not jump the gun yet.

On the 4H chart, price is still in this bullish channel, if we break to the downside, we will also have the 4H gann and QQE to cross down, so basically we'll be getting 2 confirmations of downward movement coming up, until then have some patience and relax ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

New weekly momentum is **VERY BULLISH,** opposite what I was expecting so we have to be very careful.. keep an eye on the Daily gann, if price breaks above and closes above then we are going much higher, I'll figure out later where price might go (falling asleep here it's 4am lol)

Price testing lower trendline and 205.85 is a good S/R area.

It should start heading back up once Frankfurt + London open, I don't see enough momentum for it to drop a lot more.

Also the PPI data out tonight should show inflation and will be GBP bullish but they will probably take GBPUSD down to take out the stops below. We know the drill right? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

since momentum is extremely bullish, I'm concentrating more on the bulls for now. A daily close above 209.50 which is the Daily gann hilo will be great for the bulls, here's a chart..

The Daily gann hilo also coincides with the Daily trendline and the Daily 50ema, so the 209.50 is a very important and strong area, it will be a do or die mission for the bulls if price gets there, if they don't break it then price will fall the same way it did last time it went up to 213 area. here's the daily TL

Yes, 209.50 is the area, either breaks it or a big bounce off it, since weekly momentum is very bullish I'd expect it to break but we have to wait and see.

There's nothing wrong with contradictory comments, just so long you back it up with analysis and a chart or two. We are all friends here, my brother.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

I use no SL at the beginning, most of the time I enter a trade in the direction of the Daily TF trend and whenever the trades goes my way about 100 pips, I lock in profits and then just let it run. I use the 1H TF for entry.  
  
Hope that helps.

You have to wait (paitence) for the close on the candle to determine Price Action. The DBHLC has been determined.

The best case is the Highs are the same, but they seem to work if they are close within 20-30 pips. I didn't mean to highlight 3 candles, sorry.

Thanks Jarroo.  
  
I will have my 4H candle close in 1h 15m and if by that time we will be in the same place as now would you recomend to go short ?  
  
We are below gann, QQE will be crossed.

Tough to say, I enter at 205.09 - the low of the DBHLC. May be if it retraces back to 205.00 it could be a nice short trade.

Price has broken to the downside but we have some support beneath where price is now.. so  
  
Weekly S1 @ 204  
Monthly S1 @ 203.55  
  
If price breaches these 2, we will see new low's but if price closes above the 1H gann and QQE crosses upwards, then we'll climb back up to 206-207 area.

I just drew a new trendline (red) and price seems to be bouncing off it, I don't know if price is really respecting that or not, but keep an eye on it.

save them to your MT4 expert/indicator folder (this is my location C:\Program Files\MetaTrader 4\experts\indicators), restart your mt4 platform and they will be at the top of your custom indicator list in the navigator window.  
  
if your navigator window is not showing, go to view and click it, it will pop up at either the left side or bottom of your platform area.

lol calm down JK, Fibo is a great magic tool once you know how to use it properly ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

New Daily momentum on VT is bearish  
Daily Gann moved down to 208  
  
we could see a retest of the low at 203

Nice one jarroo ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
Price still has room to retest the low and maybe make a new low at 203 but if GU wants to tank more then I don't know.  
  
The DOW also shows very bullish weekly momentum, I don't know what's up with these very bullish weekly momentums, is it trying to fool me or they're going to play out during/end of the week and surprise everyone..

Thanks, Karmo. The momentum analysis has me still baffled, but I trust yours and Aus anayisis on it. It has proven true for you in the past.  
  
You may have noticed on my chart that I have added the gann hilo and QQE. This is out of respect for your thread and I may just use it as a confirmation (dare I say) indicator.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

GU wants to go down, UJ is like on hold but momentum for UJ is bullish..  
I don't know if the monster in UJ is going to suddenly wake up and eat everyone alive or what LOL (it's 2:22 am forgive me)  
  
Good stuff, QQE and the gann are great indicators once you get used to them but always keep in mind that they can also give fake signals at times, that's why I use other stuff so I get confirmations from 2-3 different places and then come to a conclusion.

Price bouncing off weekly s1 for now, if we get a 1H QQE cross and candle close above the gann, I'll add a long to my positions.

If anything, I have found that the QQE and Gann helps determine the overall trend. I have been looking at Price Action signals with the trend for high probability trades. Today's DBHLC is a perfect example. (Downtrend; bearish Price Action). However, Price Action has proven itself as good trend reversal formations. (e.g., Pin Bars) 

Indicators show the past. Price Action "Indicates" the future.

Here's another thing I like to watch, harmonic patterns.  
We currently have a bullish butterfly on 1H TF (not a perfect one, but it's valid)  
  
Targets are the fib lines, as you all know 50% is the favorite.

That's true, they do indeed.  
  
At the end of the day, Price Action is king no doubt about it.

Double bottom @ 203.50 ?  
  
It sure does look like it, and price is trading above the 1H gann hilo, waiting 7 more mins for it to close there and then launch a long

Hourly candle closed above the Gann hilo, momentum slightly bearish indicating a retracement to the 1H 5sma, that's where I'll launch my long.

but according to aus's method, you would wait for 1H retracement to 5sma or 30m if trend is too strong, you just need to check the momentum at the beginning of the candle and be able to read it just by looking at the angle of it.

The bears must have exusted their fuel by now on GJ. Even if the Japanies govt fails to intervene, sentiment of traders will push up the pair. Moreso,  
the pair is already oversold. Am already long on the pair since it failed to break its low on the 3rd of March(daily chart).

Longs should be good until 4H Gann hilo (btw it will update in 10 mins), then we have to see if price can close above it.

Everything is looking great, if anyone entered when the candle closed above 1H gann then you should be up +150 pips by now  
  
4H candle closes in 40 mins, let's see if it closes above the 4H gann

4H 50ema @ 206.60  
  
I'm waiting for new 4H momentum to see if we will get any significant retrace or it'll continue upwards.  
  
1H QQE still has room to move price upwards.

Always trade your own plan, I look at everyone's thought but at the end I trade what I see and how I interpret the chart ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Karmo,  
The 4hr candle didn't close above Gann hilo, and you entered when 1hr crossed it. Why? Based on expirience or some addition to Aus system?  
tHANK You!

Price reached a strong support (203.50) and 1H QQE was touching oversold (30 area), those were signs of a temporary bottom but I waited for 1H QQE to cross n candle to close above the gann for confirmation before pulling the trigger.

Karmo,  
So we really don't have to always check the 4hr chart, and only base entry on 1hr Aus setup plus a few more indicators?  
Thank you,   
I'm learning the Aus princip

Not always because sometimes the 1H QQE can give you a false signal so you have to be careful. It will depend on the situation at the time.

great analysis karmo, Im learning live trading from you, thanks a lot.  
  
Whats next?  
price reached 207.50 resistance, so probably it will stall.   
However, on 4H, price just makes a candle above Gann, which should give bulls more strength, and QQE also is crossing upwards, but still under 50. Momentum strongly pointing up.   
On 1H, we have a bit bearish momentum, indicating a retracement to a fib level of the last wave, maybe 206 or 1H Gann at 205.50.  
  
I suppose 205.50 would be a good place to buy.   
  
What do you think?

Everything is looking bullish at the moment, if the day ends around here or so, most probably I'll be buying dips.  
  
I closed a couple of longs here just to take some off the table and buy at lower prices.  
  
Let's see what the momentum has got to tell us, new 4H momentum in 45 mins.

Sounds good, but I'll wait for the new 4H candle before I update my analysis ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

New 4H momentum is bullish but the candle couldn't close above the 4H 50ema again, so we might go back down to low 205's (61.8% of todays bull-run) before we get another push up.  
  
Things are a bit mixed at the moment, but watch for 1H/4H Gann hilo to provide support.

Excellent, as always, Karmo. I was going to take the retrace to the 5 sma on the hourly right after Price move above the gann, but I didn't, when to sleep instead. And is it always the case, Price moves nearly 300 pips ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f923.png?v=15.1).  
  
Great work again.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Karm,looks like the daily candle get through the gann line(but we need a new daily candle to open above it).At 207.70 on 4h we have 100 ema(maybe it should play a though resistance area) and the 1h qqe looks overbought!Maybe a retracement soon to the 1h gann?!How do u think?

New daily momentum is very bullish and the daily gann is just above, if tomorrow's candle closes above the daily gann then say hello to 213.50 and then 217 ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
  
Remember also that the weekly momentum was extremely bullish!

very true. So I suppose the retracement before the resuming of the upward move should be shallow, since even the momentum on 1H is bullish-flat, but not pointing down. I expect a reversal to 206.50 bf upward moving resumes.  
  
Edit: Moreover, yesterday candle makes a perfect DBLHC with friday, it comes right after support, so if this baby doesnt go up today, it means that i waste my time on forex. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

Jerry, I want you to read some thing that is rather long but will be well worth your time. It's from the James16 chart thread, by a guy named "the wizard".

I reckon this should retrace at least 80pips down to pick up steam for a ride up to 209.

I miss that too. Do you foresee another dip? Usually Price Action on higher time frames (although not lately) retraces into the pattern. Fib retracements are a good guide.

at the moment the 4H momentum is very bullish, pointing straight up, new momentum in an hour.  
  
If you plot a 4H 50ema, you see price bounced off that, I don't know if it'll bounce again.

we are above 1H Gann again, thanks god ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) 200 ema seems to be good support on 1 Hour as well, but the resistance at 207.70 which is actually daily R1 still plays tough to break. And europeans dont seem very aggressive buyers today.   
However, as far as I remember, the more time price spends around a level, the more likely to break it. If we break below 206 (daily PP), I will reconsider my bullish approach. 

We leave no soldier behind.

New 4H momentum remains bullish but 1H is bearish, we could see a 50% retracement of the big bull run from 203.50  
  
50% retracement is 205.75 where we also have the 4H Gann, I expect price to bounce back up from there.

Price retraced down near the 38 fib of the DBLHC. This time I caught it at 206.50![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1). Longs may be strong and not reach the 50 fib retrace.

Took 45 pips half and half b/e. Maybe it will now hit the 50 fib of 205.60ish.

Price is here at the 4H gann and close to 50%, but the new 4H momentum is bearish so it might go to 61.8% (205.24) before resuming upwards.  
  
New daily momentum in 50 mins, will update again.

New daily momentum remains bullish, so I'll buy dips and once the 1H QQE crosses upwards n candle closes above, longs should be safe.

Thanks, Karmo. I think I'm starting to understand this approach.   
It's important to determine the momentum at the very start of the hour (e.g., 4 hour,8 hour, Daily, etc.). For example, determine momentum at 5:01. Not 5:07 or 5:37, but only at 5:01. Correct?

Correct, right at the beginning of the candle because otherwise as price moves, the momentum will start to move which is not helpful then.  
  
Right at the beginning of the candle is the important part.

I'll never doubt the power of the 50 fib (and/or 62 fib) on the GBPJPY again.

Penetrated, not broken. My point is that GBPJPY respects these levels.   
  
Now if it breaks the 62 fib I agree we could be heading to 203 land.

The thing is that UY is penetrating the last low right now. if its gonna drop even further, GY might resume its downtrend. The damn FED policies were useless.

I have a question though. How did you predict that it might go up to 61.8%?  
  
I really appreciate your thought process and keep up the good work as people like me would like your inputs all the time.

Karmo would be better to answer this. He may interpret momentum differently.

Auslanco was forecasting by using the momentum indicator only, I don't try to forecast just based on momentum and forget QQE's n Gann n others I use.  
  
For example, today in the Asian session we had a 4H candle close below the Gann I see, that means intra-day trend changed to bearish regardless of the daily bullish momentum.  
  
Hope that clears it a bit.

I was reading the posts on page 22, and got the feeling that you pretty heavily rely on momentum in your analysis (it is the indicator you most often mention).  
  
But that was not my point. It was that I'm just not ready to accept the claim that based on indicator movements on a very short period of time, it is possible to forecast future price movements.  
  
Jarroo: "Thanks, Karmo. I think I'm starting to understand this approach.

Monthly S1 @ 203.55 is very strong, 4H candle couldn't close below it.  
  
If we get 1H QQE to cross up and a candle to form above gann, I'll go long, until then I'll keep watching price action.

I've used the momentum successfully many times with other indicators, something might work for me but not someone else ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

hey karmo, whats up? whats your approach on the current situation? my strategy is to do nothing for the moment, stay on the sidelines and watch. My bias is downward anyway... UY broke 100 and im sure it will go down even further, since BOJ is head-less this month.

[FXCM](/brokers/fxcm "View FXCM Broker Profile") have this great contrarian sentiment index. They were bang on on the eurusd.   
  
They are saying that the sentiment index is +2. somthing ( high) meaning that the majority are long.   
  
As this is a contrarian index the usdjpy should drop below 100.   
  
It will be interesting to watch things play out   
  
Right now the handle on the cup and handle 60 min GJ is broken and price is moving to the down side.  
  
The bear flag on 15 min uj is broken and moving down .   
  
I am short gj for now with 204 and 203.5 targets.  
  
204 / 203.5 is a support zone.   
  
The markets were bouyed up today by standard and poor mentioning only $260 billion of debt write down so far and that should be all ( we have see the bottom of the credit crisis.).  
  
We have not even seen 1/2 of it yet as there are great cases out there for bond companies losing AAA rating and up to $600 billion in write downs.  
  
There are great pips to be had in these crazy volatile times both sides of the market.   
  
I for one shall be happy for the interest rate annoucement to ocme and go next week so that the market can just get on with a nice direction , weahter it be up or down.

Yep, i know. I'm not a big fan of indicators in general... and when you just take a certain fraction of momentum data... well, it just feels a bit "odd".  
  
BTW, have you tried to analyse other indicators in the same way as momentum (stochs, rsi)? Or is momentum "special" in this respect?  
  
And one more comment: to find for instance early daily momentum direction, you go to shorter tfs, right?

We got a candle below the 1H gann but the QQE has been going sideways instead of crossing downwards.  
  
Important news in 10 mins, it should tell us the direction for the day.

No, I haven't tried it with any other indicator, but the momentum is special to me.  
  
I always keep the daily momentum at the back of my head but trade mostly based on 4H charts, sometimes 1H for entry.

We saw a new low and that was caused by news, Fridays are always crazy.  
  
The rest of the day will depend on the DOW, I'm done for today.

Karmo, this pair loves that 50 fib, as you point out day after day. Now do we bounce up and back to the 38 fib (211.77) or do we go down to test the 61 fib (187.49). ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Maybe this pair is always searching for a 50 fib level, we just have to figure out which time frame she favors. I mean, now that she satisfied the monthly 50 fib, maybe she'll now go and satisfy the weekly 50 fib retrace to 255.47. I'm just thinking out loud.

The 50% is a magnet for the beast, but it seems to have more room to go down, if you want to go long for long-term and aim for the weekly 50% fib, I would wait for a daily close above 50ema and daily QQE to cross above & candle to close above daily gann.

I agree, Karmo. All indications you mentioned are showing that the Monthly 62 fib (187.49) is possible. I'm starting to use that gann/qqe for trend direction. I'm liking it.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
I was just trying to get in to the mind of the beast, if she has one. LOL

Karo or jarroo could you tell me how to obtain the Gann and QQE file and then how do i get them on my chart. I'm not the most computer savvy guy and tend to need some help. I also really appreciate this thread and find it very helpful. Thanks for all the input guys.

> Karo or jarroo could you tell me how to obtain the Gann and QQE file and then how do i get them on my chart. I'm not the most computer savvy guy and tend to need some help. I also really appreciate this thread and find it very helpful. Thanks for all the input guys.

Here are Gann and QQE files. Go to your metatrader folder and open the expert folder. In there, you'll see the indicators folder, open that up and place the indictors in there. Then restart your metatrader.

Gimp not sure what price you went long at ... but here is what I am thinking may happen.   
  
The pair might bounce into 38.2% fib of move 207.95 to 199.90 zone onto 203 forming a bear flag. This is the top of the lienar regression channel. The fact that price is so far under its 10 sma , this is likely to happen as the 10 sma acts as a magnet to price.   
  
Now if the channel remains intact the price will come back down into 127 % fib extension at 199.06 , but more likely the bottom of the channel and 161.8% fe at 197.   
  
Time targets :  
203 : overnight Sunday / Monday pacific standard  
197: March 18th ( chart show march 16th but i have to add 2 day because of no weekend trading for forecasting)  
  
Time forecasting works by looking back at historical trend line slopes and applying simple geometry.   
  
In my gbpjpy scalper forum I nailed eurcad target of 1.5500 to the day using this exact tehcnique shown in the chart below. That was a sweet 700 pip trade this month .  
  
It is just simple geometry and some assumptions..  
  
Now if the channel is broken to the upside then the plan will have to be reconsidered, however as you are in a long it would be going in your favour.  
  
The other secanrio is that on open today it just drops 300 pips in no time and has NO retrace. The chances of this are slim . but if it does I would just cut the loss ( my stops for swing trading gbpjpy on a 2 hour are 200 pips)

It's the tax year that is excellerating the drop, the Yen is being pulled back for the accounting period, mid april will see the run up start again as the money flows back in.  
  
Watch AJ also as i feel this is the pair that will see most yen investment due to the now increasing interest rate difference and the fallen rates in the UK

Price Action and S/R Levels. I am now using the Gann hi/lo (10) and QQE (5) for trend direction. When using Price Action with the trend the higher the probablity these trades become. Meaning : Bullish Price Action in an uptrend. Bearish Price Action in a downtrend.   
  
Daily, 4 hour and hourly: Gann and QQE bearish. QQE on the hourly was bullish but bearish on the 4 hour.  
  
Only taking the bottom of this Inside Bar (candle) on the 4 hour.   
  
Enter short at 194.50 Result half at +153 pips other half +71 pips.

1 hour gann turned bullish. May take a hard break long off the S/R level of 196.69 with a tight s/l.  
  
Higher time frames still bearish.  
  
Update: Price broke the 196.69 and then fell back. Weak break for long trade. I need a strong break to go long.  
No entry long.

My 1st target is half of my postion 50 to 100 pips. The other half to b/e or depending on Price Action on the hourly.  
  
Result: half postion +96 pips. Other half move to b/e.   
  
Pin Bar on hourly. Price broke down from the Pin Bar and closed my b/e half at +64 pips.   
  
Theme of my trades is to keep my loses small (or to zero) and giving my trades a chance to run for long term profits.

Confirmation on the hourly gann and QQE.  
  
A more comfortable trade knowing that its with the overall (higher time frames) down trend.

Should have taken half at 50 pip / half at break even. My fault, not the market's.

Yes, I use the same rules for GU with gann and qqe. I also use Price Action as a guide force especially on higher time frame, because higher time frames Rule.   
  
Although the gann and qqe show a down trend, the Daily Pin Bar (trend reversal formation) can not be ignored. Like Karmo, Fibs on higher time frame can show future movement.   
I should have shown more patience (sorry karmo) and waited to enter at exactly 1.9757 (fib 61.8) instead of the 1.9770. Price kissed that fib and trend line on the money and started north.

stopped out @ 198.35, -153 pips  
  
**GBP/JPY** is modestly higher at the 198's after dipping to 196.80 this morning, but remains below 199.00. Further rebound through 198.35 high on Mar 20 may add some upward momentum, but **inability to clear the Mar 19 reactionary high of 199.25 would keep the picture bearish even in the near term.** Basically the trendline would be crossed only around 208.00 and the mid Jan - Feb congestion top around 213.50-214.00 looks heavy, and sell onto the rebound in a patient manner is needed. As Europe's conservative accounting is delaying realization of subprime loan related losses of banks in the area, pressures over the Gbp and Eur look more likely now. The headline pair Gbp/Usd's 1.9735/22 lows on Mar 20/05 are the important support that needs to hold to prevent further losses.

What do you all feel will be the outlook on a disastrous existing home sales number later today?  
  
Will that be enough to pop the G/J out of the range to either side? Opinions?

I've locked in at break even on my 1.9770 entry. I may add to my position at on a hard break and then support of the 1.9880 (top of the Pin Bar)  
  
4 hour chart shows a spinning top (an indecision formation). A break down at the bottom of this candle, I will take half position in profits and other half will stay at break even.

Don't be quick to dismiss the Fibs. Karmo has proved their effectiveness. The important point here is that we are looking for a confluence of events to give us a high probablity trade. In this case: Price Action, Fibs, trendline and later the gann & qqe. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

jaroo,goodmorning. i was asleep. its 6.48am here. just woke up to my charts.   
  
UJ seems to be pulling GJ with it.GU is holding well. i cannot truly say if dis is a retracement or a reversal. based on my analyses i woud have shorted at 200.01 for some pips. I will not be going short until i have a 1hr close below d 1hr 50ema. 4 now im on d sidelines even if i dont get d pips down to 1hr 50

You and others have menition that before. My mistake. Must add to my notes in **bold letters**. Plus a series of small, reversal candles on the 4 hour. I should of known. Live and learn to trade another day.   
Still hanging on with my 200.15 and 200.28 long position. I'll hedge at 199.20 because there will probably be another attempt at the Daily gann.  
  
Thanks GedfreyH,  
  
Jaroo, i saw ur post at d other thread, Price tends to bounce on d 30min,1hr, 4hr, daily, monthly and sometimes 15min gann. dats y karmo stessed their importance to u.  
  
I personally trade d 4hr and 1hr gann bounce, i use d cross or bounce of d 15mins as a heads up 4 trade. just tot u should know

I made some mistakes on my GBPJPY trade I'll wait for the London open to decide on my position.   
  
Catching the Pin Bar retrace on the Daily GBPUSD has proved very successful.

Ur GU trade was good![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1). u wont believe, d UJ down move was a bounce off d daily gann. GJ didnt bounce of d daily gann. daily gann was 20pips away, but it is still valid as a bounce. all im saying is dat d UJ gann bounce was what brought GJ down. im bullish bias if UJ statrs showing bull signs based on qqes and gann action

As you can see, we are in a triange, in d middle of no where. there is no use trying to predict if it will go up or down. All we need to do is trade d hard break of dis triange to d upside or downside.  
  
  
I will use qqes and gann on 15min and 1hr and 4hr to confirm direction, normal Auslanco style.

I learned all my fib lessons from Karmo. Practise, Practise, Learn and Practise.

I'll stay with my 1.9770 and 1.9885 a little longer![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1). Daily gann may stay broken to the upside. I have taken some profits off the table.

In all honesty, I'm not sure how its implemented. I'm probably making it more complicated then it is. I will be reading Jacko's thread as well.

They look the same, don't they.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) One is a 4 hour and the other is a Daily at different times, different pairs. This shows the power of Price Action (Pin bars) on trend lines.

I'm back ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60e.png?v=15.1)  
  
Let's get down to analysis, here's a daily GJ chart, after the big fall to 192.40, we can see price has retraced all the way back up to 78.6% where we also had the daily 50ema and the upper TL of the Daily downtrend channel, 205 was also a strong S/R on my chart. Now looking at the daily QQE, this past friday we got the 1st candle closed below the Daily Gann hilo, it indicates to me that there is more downside coming soon, even a new low is possible.

I reckon that we are headed South  
There is a H&S on the 4 hr - we are currently trying to break the neckline.  
I reckon the reason it didn't was the G7 and possible expectation of a deal on the Dollar strength. That didn't happen.  
The Dow is looking weak - it has ignored fundementals, 2 weeks ago appalling NFP numbers didn't register. A gap around 12100 needs to be filled and I think all this will send it to at least 12000. These considerations all will come to gether to a large fall.  
I have my fingers crossed

Welcome back, Karmo. Hope you didn't mine that I hijacked your thread for a little awhile, a couple weeks ago. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) I figured that if I got some people to your thread and they read it from the beginning, they would benefit.

The G7 apparently gave some indications for Dollar to strengthen because the Euro is below 1.57 and the GJ is above 199 on quotes I'm seeing at xe.com

Couple of Inside Bars (candles) on the Weekly chart. The Weekly is in an obvious downtrend, so a break of the bottom of the Inside Bars looks to be a higher probability trade.

I understand you trade breakouts from previous weekÂ´s ranges, while doing this, do you wait for a candle to close above/below said level or the mere fact of price touching it is enuff confirmation to get in?  
do you have a journal of your own or could you please direct me to your most important posts so I can get the details of your technique

When Price approaches a strong S/R level, how does it behave? If Price is not driven through these S/R levels by Price Action, then I look at Price itself.  
  
Is Price stalling and stammering at this level? Is Price come near but not touching this level. Or (the best situation) is Price running hard through this level and not looking back. Does it retrace back to this level and then continues on. ( I love that, because it confirms the S/R level)  
  
Practise and more practise is the best way to learn how Price behaves at these S/R levels on a given pair.   
  
Price came down today and kissed the 198.05 level (Bottom Weekly IB) and ran away. This is a strong S/R level. If Price comes down and breaks this level HARD, we will see some good pips on the down side.  
  
The key thing I work on is finding and confirming S/R Levels. Do they have a good history, have they acted the same way in the past. Higher time frames helps me in my search.  
  
I do have a Journel, but its not this forum. It's in a note book.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Longs still seem in play, price is trading above daily 50ema, new monthly momentum was bullish, so we might see 211-213 at last and if that breaks then 216 which is the 50% fib on my weekly chart and a weekly TL ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Good call. Your short worked. Looking at the daily, we had a nice lower close yesterday around a visual resistance point 208. The MACD has also turned bearish. I'm putting a short order 206.25 with a 50 pip stop.

At 6am GMT, I am going long on GJ as I noticed it always goes up before London opens at 8am. What you guys think ?

Good day   
today like i am viewing this trend if it crosses 205.85 then we should see a short for like 30 pips, after then the trend i think should continue because the retracement of 100% fibo is still in progress. Action bias for today is down and if news favours the down again then we smile to like 70-100 pips at least before then end of today. but for the downward trend short to begin i think the price should at least cross 205.85 because the price has been shy downwards. also the point is temporary support.  
cordially , i will appreciate responce.  
great piping

Karmo is back ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60e.png?v=15.1)  
  
Time for some simple and effective analysis  
  
We all know that price has been in a downward channel since late 2007 and that channel was broken a month ago but on the daily chart price never came back and re-tested it. We also had a bear flag (small bullish channel) formed and this past week it was broken to the downside (see the chart). Price has also closed below the lower BB (bollinger band) , all of these indicate strong bearish movement.   
Now my TP for shorts is the 78.6 or 88.6 fibo of the big move up we had from 192.xx to 209 , we also have a confluence of that downward channel that was broken a month ago and never re-tested, so that area should act as support.  
  
<http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/3052/gjjy2.gif>  
WARNING! the beast may do anything so be careful  
  
At the beginning of the week we might have a small retracement up towards the 38.2 or the famous 50 before it resumes downwards.  
  
<http://img375.imageshack.us/img375/2746/gjuj9.gif>  
  
Now let's go to the Daily QQE and the gann, price has closed below the gann and the QQE has crossed down, I'd assume we will have a daily 5sma retrace before resuming, and that should coincide with the 38.2 or 50 fib level, we'll know for sure once the market open so keep your eyes open ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

We can see that 203.60 area was a good support, it should be a good resistance now that it has been broken, plus it is between the 38.2 and the 50 fib which I expect price to retrace to, as jarroo says "Confluence!" ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

guys , can you tell me please which broker has the best conditions for trading gbp/jpy ?  
I'm interesting in doing about 5 trades a day so low commisions and [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") are crucial  
  
thanks

News on weekend ..ANB first bank to go down this year .. will open as Little Rock on Monday.  
  
2) we have broken 50 sma on 15 min ... looks to be heading down to test Friday's low. I am short off 200.90 and have moved stop to break even already.  
3) broke Friday's trend line in the US session to down side.  
  
Looks like that retracement to 203.4 might not happen after all .... I was expecting it to but do not get married to one direction or other .. just go with what the chart tell me.

Karmostaji , sorry I know its a bit out of topic but could you tell me which broker offers the lowest spreads on gbp/jpy ?   
I've checked crown forex , they offer great deal on usd/jpy just 1 pip and no comission , but on gbp/jpy its 10 pips

new 4h momentum in 30 mins and this hourly candle close should give us an idea if that 4h gann will hold or not

203.60 seems to be a tough S/R just like I expected, now let's wait for the new daily momentum, if it turns out to be bearish then the retracement IMO is over and downtrend shall continue towards 196 area

Ok price came down but only to the 4H gann and we are having a bounce up now, if price closes above the 1H gann hilo then price will move to a new higher which should be around the 50% fib 204.38

1H QQE has not crossed down yet, if it does and a candle is formed below the 1H gann hilo then to me that's a good signal to go short

today the Gj rose up midly only go slow down on weak data. price opening today on candle stick looks like an hammer that could finally break the 100% fibo retracement which is the short term resistance, after the breaking of 100% fibo, i expact the price to find its bearing at least 30 pips after this point, if no major great britain price mover is out then we could beuy for the whole day.daily macd and 4 hrs showing change in thrend is starting, momentum is forming another double bottom.and the pivot point for today is already broken , i see a move in upward at least for the next 4hrs, once the next 4hr candle opens above then long buyers are still in the game.  
action bias for today is also neutral turned upwards  
.  
good luck, would like as many as possible contribution and arguement

The reason I ask is I got a little caught after the last consolidation at 202.50 looking to go south then the thing went north for no good reason.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f615.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/2753.png?v=15.1)

Major support was at 202.50...it needed to break to continue down, from a basic technical perspective....it failed and bounced off support. Theres your reason.  
  
Further more, the resistance that was holding it from going higher was 204.82 and 204.96....it broke that and it went higher. 

The only sovereign I can allow to rule me is reason.

204.80 strong S/R level  
Daily 50ema and 100sma are @ 204.80  
Daily candles are not able to close below it  
Daily gann hilo is @ 204.80  
  
If we draw a fibo from 199.76 to 208.93 , price has retraced to the famous 50% which is 204.35 and bounced  
  
If Daily candles are not able to close below 204.80, we could easily see a re-test of the highs and even going to 211-213  
  
BUT, if we get a Daily candle formed below, then look out below  
  
till then, PATIENCE!

Ok, I get some PMs from time to time asking me to explain Gann, QQE, momentum and 5sma. I just replied someone and thought I'd post it here as well.  
  
I'll try to explain how I use these indicators as briefly as I can.  
  
I'll keep it simple.. the Gann hilo is used as Support/Resistance, sometimes price will bounce off it. Another thing is If price is trading below the Gann hilo, let's say on the Daily chart then I'll be favoring the bears and try to find bearish set-ups on smaller TF's, you should also keep track of the QQE.  
  
Example:  
If Daily QQE crosses upwards and Daily candle closes above the Gann hilo, then the Daily chart just turned bullish to me and I'd be buying dips (most probably around the Daily 5sma)  
  
The momentum is used with the Daily 5sma, I mostly use it to try and catch retracement, The most important thing is the angle of the movement **at the beginning of the candle** and not during the candle.  
  
Example:  
  
Let's say we had a rally on the Daily chart and price is currently 209, Daily 5sma is at 207.10 and the momentum at the beginning of the new daily candle is pointing slightly down, that indicates price will retrace to the Daily 5sma and most likely resume upwards the next day.  
  
You must follow real price action and practice to grasp it 

Trade what you see, not what you think.

That is a typo, it is meant to be 'the angle of the momentum at the beginning of the candle'

Karmo, thanks A LOT for setting up this thread and sharing your knowledge. You are a good example of how good solid basics beat any fancy indicator ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) Well done!   
  
A quick question - what are typical weekly/monthly results (in terms of pips)? How many pairs do you trade?  
  
Cheers.

You are most welcome ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Regarding your question, I trade GJ exclusively.. I just love this pair. Number of pips per month, I'd say 1500 to 2000 pips 

Trade what you see, not what you think.

Price bounced off the 4H 50ema and a TL, if price closes above the 1H 50ema and 4H gann hilo then we could expect another re-test of the highs or even a new high, 214 maybe.  
On the other hand, if price closes below 4H 50ema, next target would be the Daily gann hilo.

Karmo, how do you feel about 215 ? I see that most traders want to short the pair but in my opinion we still have room to go upside.

But first we must clear a huge hurdle at 214.50/60  
which I doubt we are going to blow through on the first try or even the second try.  
  
LT is still bullish in GJ I think, but we may get a move down into 209.50 before we run up to test 214.50/60 for the first time in a while.

The lowest TF I would go is the 15m chart, but I mainly focus on 1H, 4H, and the Daily chart.

Daily candle has closed above the 200ema, next target for the bulls is the 50% fib @ 216.88 where we also a weekly TL, that are should provide strong resistance.

I draw suport/resistance lines all over my charts. I put thick lines on the monthly/weekly then thinner lines on the daily, 4 hour, 1 hour, and 15 mintute. Then I draw Fibo on the last movement on the 1 hour. when I'm finished with all of that I hardly have an open space to make a trade with out running into a line. I'v been reading your early posts where you describe your trading method (thank you for doing so).   
My question is, would it be better to not draw my own lines? would it be better to only draw fibo on the diferent time charts then look for over lap????????  
  
thank you

>  I totally know what you are saying and it is indeed very hard to draw a 100% accurate fibo level, especially on longer timeframes such as the weekly. I had a hard drawing this fib on the weekly myself, I just decided to draw it from the 200 point since it a nice uptrend move started from there. I have drawn from the points you mentioned, and it gets even more interesting, we will have to keep an eye and see which one is going to be the more appropriate one.

Numbers that end in zero tend to be good suport/resistance levels, so perhaps drawing your fibo from or to numbers that end with zeros might make good sense. Also another point on fibo, every book that I have read says to draw left to right, so if it's low to high or high to low it's always left to right period. I'll post a fibos that goes in Expert/indicators on MT-4, I use it some times on a 15 min if I'm looking for an entry.

Daily 200ema has turned into support now, price is fighting 213.50 for now, if it breaks then it heads toward 216.xx

Karmo,  
  
I've closed my long from 213.20 for 50 pips because price on 4hr is most likely going to retrace back to 5sma line(213.29 at the present time) on 4hr. Was that a smart thing to do?  
  
What is your strategy?  
  
Since price bounced off 213.82 for the 5th time, I'm sure there is going to be a breakout today! I thought it was going to go up last night...but at the meantime, it is going down to me.

I was just re reading this thread karmo and cam across an old four hour chart of yours which looked exactly my current weekly GJ setup. No great analysis, just thought it would be fun to share.

Hi Karmo,  
  
What is your strategy for this week? I think we are going to be in a tight range between 213(100ema) and 215(50ema)on weekly. If this goes both way, there would be a massive pip movement on either way.

Excuse me, but how did you know that there was going to be a bearish move before the breakout? Could you explain this? And how did you know that when 1hr QQE crossed, it was going to be a profitable move? Many of those crosses during a big bearish move would not turn profitable.  
  
I entered my long today at 213.40 today when 1hr QQE crossed. How come you wouldn't wait if 4hr QQE crossed today?

Nvm, I found out that we're near 50% retracement on 4hr. Nice find, Karmo.

Same chart Karmo posted before, came to the same conclusion. Big area of confluence and the possibility of a move to 180 from here or...the mind set change to go long. Time will tell. However here's how big this area is to me at least. Hitting the downtrend line from the 251 high, we're at 50% retracement of the move AND 50% retracement of the projected move to 180, we broke the daily Bollinger band and formed a bearish engulfing right after, we just hit the 200 day MA on the weekly and daily to a certain extent. Why am I bearish? Classic bear flag, most visible on the daily, we're technically in a downtrend. Adios

Karmo,  
  
Ronald(RR) made this ea especially for your strategy. Just in case if you don't want to miss a possible major retracement, you can use this ea to send you a text message and an email to signal you.  
  
I set this ea to notify me if price is at least 70 pips away from 5sma.

Price is trading in a bearish flag, IMO it will break downwards sooner or later..  
4H QQE has recovered close to the 50 level and it might be getting ready to cross back downwards and head to new lows.

Price is still trading in the 4h bear flag, we are currently at the bottom of it and I've taken some longs targeting the upper TL of the flag.

Could that be considered a bullish flag or not since we are below the 4hr gann. Thanks for your help

no I wouldn't consider this a bullish flag because it is not after a strong rally, so to me it is just a 1H downtrend channel.

Price is trading below 4h gann hilo and the new 4h momentum is bearish

price is approaching the support level slowly, I'd like to see the support level broken.  
  
London open should be interesting.

I'd like to see UJ break 106.70 level, then GJ will tank even more.

15m QQE has already crossed up but price is trading below the 15m gann hilo  
  
This is usually an indication of bearish continuation, we just have to wait for the 15m QQE to get itself out of oversold levels.

15m QQE crossed down with a candle below it's gann, it's time for bearish continuation just as expected.

Until the charts tell me otherwise, that is for how long  
  
and how low, I'd say 183, 180, 176 ...choose 1 ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Karmo I respect you as a fellow trader and do not want to step on your toes here. I think you are great at what you do and with the sharing you give. In fact I got into it with 4x trader the other day when he was putting you down as i was defending your honour.  
  
  
Just a freindly note to watch that bullish divergence on the 4 hour off the double bottom. I am not 100% sure but something tells me this may be heading up.  
  
I have a 1-2-3 buy formation on a 15 min and this could take it up to 189 tonight if 187 holds.

Thanks for defending me the other day malcolmb, I appreciate it. and thanks for your analysis.  
  
I did say that we might see bearish continuation as long as price remains below 4h gann hilo but price did close above it so it is bullish for the short-term, anyways I had lots of profits locked in so I had no problems at all ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Good luck trading bro

4h 50ema is @ 190.70 providing resistance for now  
  
If price manages to close below 1h gann hilo and 1h QQE crosses downwards, I would take a short.

I'll be watching the Daily chart, if we get a Daily candle close above the Daily gann hilo, I'll be bullish GJ and my target will be a Daily correction of 50% fibo.

I was asked what was the outcome of this trade. It was 0 pips. I entered short at 192.62 as Price hit the Daily Gann.   
When Price bounced down, I took half off of my position at 50 pips and left the other half at my s/l. Price came back and took out my s/l for net 0 pips.

4h QQE has crossed down and we just got a candle close below 4h gann hilo  
  
I expect bearishness to continue and very high possibility of seeing new lows today/tomorrow

I don't know, we must see how NY reacts to all the bad news and if the Fed will do anything to help the markets.

Look how we are in a Daily range of 500-600 pips, look at how QQE has crossed up and getting out of the lower levels but price is not moving higher everyday, price is bouncing up and down like nuts.  
  
I've seen many setups like this on smaller TF's, so if this setup works like I think it should then once Daily QQE crosses back down, GJ will tank towards the Monthly trendline around 176 if not lower.  
  
I will enter once I get confirmation, no need to rush in.  
  
1 more thing, you don't have to believe me because I could be wrong as well.

Ok I see last week got interesting by the end of the week, the Feds came out to play.  
Price is currently in a nice bullish channel on the 1h chart, 193.50 area is a good S/R level, 1h 50ema and also the LT of the channel, and 4h gann hilo  
  
If price gets there and starts bouncing a bit, I would take a long definitely and targeting Daily 50ema which is around 199 or so.  
  
But if we get 4h QQE to cross down and a 4h candle closes below 4h gann, I'll go short  
  
Other than that, I stay out

We have candles above the 1h Gann hilo, but I'm waiting for the 1h QQE to cross upwards and we should see some new high's.  
  
I will only go short if we get a 4h close below 4h Gann hilo.  
  
Price is also trading above the 50ema and inside the bullish channel on 1h TF.

The 15m QQE crossed downwards but price is trading above the 15m gann hilo, this is also usually a sign of trend continuation which is bullish in this scenario.  
  
Everything is lining up quiet nicely for some nice bullish action.

The other thread has a lot of noise and many people posting 1m/3m/5m/15m scalps, insanity lol

Price is still trading above the 15m gann and the 15m QQE looks like about to cross upwards, once crossed and confirmed.. we should see more bullishness.

Price breaking out and there has been a QQE upward cross on 15' ... but price never reached your 193.50 level, so do you have a position & if not where would you get one?

The hourly candle closes in 2 mins, if 1h QQE crosses and confirms, I'll be going long on any retracement to the 5sma (TF's 15m/30m or 1h)

finally we had a candloeclose above 4h5 5sma. i missed that. But 4hr MOM not supportive of bulls. I think the problem with today is that based on MOM and AUS daily technique daily and weekly MOM are shouting fo a retracement to 193.59/194 area fo 2day. At d end of 2dayscandle that owuld change.  
  
As i said earlier i was sensing consolidation. im sensing 100pips up 100pips down moves until the 15mins MAS get some breathing space. Right now they are chocked up. 4hr 5sma would be a perfect long entry if 1hr remeian bullish

4h gann hilo is @ 195  
  
This should be our support. I won't short unless this gann hilo is broken.  
  
All we need is a 1h candle close above 197 and it should easily reach 199.

I closed at BE, 197 is being tough and I don't like Oil shooting up to $130, $25 in 1 day!! It tells me that risk aversion is in the markets and people are afraid.  
  
If 1h QQE crosses down with a candle close below gann, I'll short and add more once we get a 4h QQE cross down confirmation.

Closed right on the 1h gann .. close enough? Or will you wait for more confirmation?

I'll wait, it's even safer to wait for the 4h chart to turn bearish for better confirmation

I am sitting here like a deer ( or in your neck of the world camel) in the headlights .... gj seems unable to break 197 and i wonder if we were able to short financial stocks where the DJ and gj would have ended up today.  
  
BTW I used to live in Jebel Ali a number of years ago ...would love to come out to Dubai once more to see how things have changed out there.

hi karmo jan  
i should note that this is not risk aversion...if risk aversion occurs then all of yen crosses must drop ...but now only usd/yen dropped...i think it's all about dollar weakening not risk aversion...also it may depend to surge of euro too....becoz oil price has correlation with euro...  
also i shouild add this crazy action may has a another wonder reason that we don't know....we should wait till get what happend

...........  
The October contract expires today and a big reason for today's rally was short covering. Short covering occurs when a buyer borrows a stock, betting it will go down, then has to buy it back at that lower price. A lot of traders were short oil, assuming the only way it could go was down, then had to cover their bets before the contract expired.

mm.... that sounds like someone trying to hide their tracks ... when you make big footprints like the ones we have seen today in oil you need more than a little fern to hide the tracks.

LOL gj is hopping up and down like a rabbit.  
  
Nice, you should definitely come back because things are changing here every single day and it never finishes, I just wish all the construction would just get done.

Hey Karmo, how've you been man?   
  
This isn't really in line with Aus's system, but for price action's sake; My last eight hour bar (at 12 o' clock Eastern) closed with a confirmation bar to the pin bar before which closed at 195.60 at support. 194.26 was the low for the pin and so I wouldn't look to see price move below that area.  
  
Right now, I am looking for lows of 195.20's to come into play for this retracement then we should be looking at a bounce from that point to move in line with the pin bar's original direction.  
  
I'm not on my normal computer with my charts set up so I can't really post them up. I'll edit this later and do so though.  
  
tell me if you'd like me to delete this post as it isn't in line with your thread completely.  
  
P.S. The new daily 5 ema closed at 194.19 on my charts. 

I dream, therefore I become.

good evening all,  
  
obvious double top @ 197.00, in the form of a 1-2-3 formation, breaking confidently 195.50 as i write on h4 time frame this could well mean that this is indeed a very wide range for the carry given current market uncertainty.  
  
I wish my suggestion could only benefit others as a contribution, and not a "follow me" message. This is a wonderful pair to trade and the excitement about it is that it respects pretty well its general long term trends in the shape of nice waves with similar ending characteristics - nice "technical textbook like" trend exhaustion price action patterns in weekly. I personally believe that it is headed for retesting of new lows, which could be fueled by recent headline events affecting carry trade - spikes/trend resuming in oil provokes sell offs in equity markets driving speculative money to oil again, and we have the carry selloffs. I still think this could be a continuation to further bear conditions for this pair.  
  
I wish good luck to all. Thank you for the experience you bring to regular readers like me. 

Thank you Malcolm, Belekas, Jim, raczekfx and Ryanmcd !

We have a candle formed under the 4h Gann hilo but no 4h QQE cross down, once we get the cross down.. this baby is going to tank towards the 4h 50ema which is around 192  
  
But becareful coz if 1h QQE crosses upwards and price manages to get above the 4h gann hilo and break 197, then 199 will be on the cards.

no, actually more to the downside but I'll wait for a breakout of 197 or 195, price is currently trading between these 2 prices on the 1h chart.

Oh ok, I assumed you meant up when you said breakout (I call the other way a breakdown ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)) But that's right, it can break out in either direction...

From the fib of last SH SL on daily, there is a 61.8 retracement at the weekly pivot and monthly S1 ... my vote would be a retracement to at least this level (192.70) before perhaps another fast run up to the weekly R1 area around 201. Not that she pays much attention to pivot or s/r levels but she will often barrel through them then come screeching to a halt and reverse, there are fe's on either side of the weekly R1.

hi karmo. please look at my chart which shows it has not broke to the upside. infact the last candle closed right on it and this new candle is retreating. i noticed the diferance in drawing the lines between you and i. i have drawn from top of wicks which is 41 candles ago. where you have drawn a line to the candle which is 40 candles ago and a lower high than the candle previous to that. please dont think that i am corecting you, far from it. most likely i have drawn it wrong. for educational reasons, just want to know why you've drawn the line to a lower candle as i just explained. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Price has also closed above the 200ema on the 4h chart, another bullish sign  
4h momentum is also pointing upwards.

I just drew a horizontal line at 197 because that level seemed to be resistance to me, and it looks like it has turned into support now.

Yes, either my SL gets hit or we reach the Daily 50ema (198.60) ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

Mine just got hit as well, 1% is no big deal.. let's move on ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
4h candle closed back below 200ema, I'll watch and see if the 1h 50ema will break this time or not, it has been holding up quiet nicely till now.

4h chart still shows that we are trading in the range of 195-197, no true breakout.

Back in no man's land (sigh)  
  
I just could not see it as a long or a breakout .. especially the consolidation on the 5' and 15'. I wasn't around at London open, arrived around 11 am London time and it just was looking so toppy to me. Probably a lucky guess ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1).

this is a pretty strong support, price hasn't been able to break it but if broken then I'll go short.

I'm a swing trader and these past 2-3 days is just not for me, I'm waiting for 197 to break or the 1h 50ema to break.  
  
It's better to stay aside in this ranging period ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

I wanted to speculate that too; but the question is that when will it break it & also the slow momentum.

Yes definitely, I've been saying that a lot in auslanco's thread, I will be short big time when the Daily crosses back down because that should take us to 180/176 area ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

What is your target Karmo?  
  
I am aiming for the 4h 50 ema around 194, what do you think?

That's a good target, but first I'd like to see the 1h 50ema break, I've set my SL at BE already.

It can be played both ways, price is still trading within the wedge

It is bouncing off the 1h 50ema again, I just closed it for 40 pips. I'll re-enter short if we get an hourly close below 1h 50ema.

The 4h QQE is suggesting of bullish continuation as long as price trades above the Daily gann hilo. Look at how the 4h chart has been ranging but QQE crossed down and pulling back down while price didn't, I will go long once the 4h QQE crosses back up and we should see atleast the Daily 50ema and then the 50% (200.15)  
Always wait for confirmation.

correct me if am wrong, 200 is more likely be the top for the current trend and then we gonna start a new trend which gonna end somewhere around 179 

I recommend you read something else as this sentence is now concluded.

A good target for shorts is the Daily gann hilo around 191.30  
  
I wouldn't go long as the 1h QQE crossed upwards and a candle forms above it's gann hilo.  
  
Right now price is bearish and if it manages to get to 4h 5sma, I'll go short.

If you draw fib retracements 190 to 197.30 the 50% retracement was hit bang on at 193.53 and formed support  
  
The RSI hit 40 on the 4 hour and bounced off it.  
  
Right now price is under the 33 and 14 sma on a 4 hour BUT there is now a 1-2-3 buy formation on the 4 hour with targets of 198 , 201.61. If that 197.30 resistance zone is broken we should see 200 / 201.6 with ease  
  
The last week has been very tough to trade ... very tough, with the bearish divergence on the 4 hour rsi it was short the rallies all week off 197 zone. now that the rsi has had a chance to drop and rally on a steep incline we may see another test of 197. If the RSI breaks 60 then for sure we will get a break out of 197.  
  
If price breaks 195.80 then the 33 sma will now form support again. This consolidation has allowed the moving average to catch up with price. Moving averages act as magnets and when price gets to far ahead of them it will either drop back to the moving average or consolidate till the moving average catches up.   
  
With this Bill sitting in Senate technicals have been very hard to trade to this week

Weekly momentum is bearish and the Daily gann hilo on VT charts is at 192.00  
A daily close below the daily gann hilo and the daily QQE crossing down, that would give us the signal of a strong bearish movement and I'll be expecting 176/180 area definitely.

A target for the shorts would be the Daily gann hilo at 192.00  
  
We'll have to see if we either get a bounce or price is going to try and stay below it.

Looks like it's bouncing off daily gann, I might buy with a tight stop

Ok I've taken a long risking 1% with a tight stop  
  
I'll add if we get a 15m signal long based on QQE and gann hilo

4h candle has closed below the 100sma  
  
I'd love to see the daily candle close below the gann hilo with the daily QQE crossing down, that would be a strong signal to go short. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

The Daily QQE has crossed downwards and we have a Daily candle close below the gann hilo, this is a strong bearish signal.  
  
Right now we have a bearish flag (continuation pattern) on the 15m chart, once it is broken to the downside, bearish movement should continue IMO.

Ask me, im stuck on 3 shorts, its only my belief that's its in a downtrend why im still tolerating the -100 pip swings. I think its the USDJPY uptrend that's clogging the movements of gj and ej

I guess we have to be on our toes just in case those crazy people in Washington some how get that bail out plan through in the next couple of days, what are your thoughts on it Karmo?![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f612.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/231b.png?v=15.1)  
  
I guess the simple thing is to keep watching the QQE and gann and just trade the charts and worry about the bail out if it ever happens.

I do have that at the back of my mind, but something interesting happened the other day. The Fed Bernanke pumped into the markets nearly 630 billion and it did basically nothing to the market, so if we do get this bailout of 700b, is it enough? Logically to me I don't think so.

the 4h worked just as expected, it has crossed back down and should be expecting more downside.  
  
My targets are 184, 180, and 176 area.

Sure bro ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
The Daily chart where we can see it is indicating a bearish Daily trend.  
  
Sometimes when we get a bit of a bounce, many people start screaming that it is a reversal and so on, the QQE has helped me a lot to differentiate between a retracement or a full reversal, look at the 4h chart, the QQE crossed back upwards but price struggled to close above the 4h gann, the QQE just took its time and got out of oversold levels and now it is crossing back down which indicates more downside to come.  
  
A reversal would be the QQE crossing upwards and we get a 4h candle close at the same time or maybe 1 candle later, this applies on any TF btw.  
  
If you also look at when the 4h QQE crossed upwards, price also had a hard time to even break the 1h 50ema, all these are signs told me that the bounce was just a retracement and we should sell the rally which I did.

Hi there,  
Do you see some possible retracement until 180-180.40 area now?  
Or south till 172.50?

I actually see bearish continuation patterns on smaller TF's, so maybe this downward is not over yet.  
  
78.6% monthly fibo is at 170.20

I see 172.50 as the 138.2 extension of the 38.2 retracement on the daily tf....  
But i also take into consideration a retest of the previous supp at 180.50, , also a 50% retracement of this big down move. I will add more shorts there....do you think it's a valid point of view? 

I don't say

Well I guess this settles definitively who knows how to read the charts .. and who does not! I'm staying away from the aus thread now except for occasional visits as all it has been for the past 3 weeks is "buy, sell, buy, sell, buy, buy, reversal, buy, sell'   
I admit it was confusing and several times sucked me into reversing trades that should never have been reversed. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
  
One person stuck to his charts the whole way .... and that was (drum roll...) ... karmo!  
  
QQE and Gann tell the story simply enough for a swing trader, too many other indicators just muddy the waters.   
Look at the daily chart .. after that row of dojis in late Sept, when QQE crossed down, the GY course was set, all one had to do was load up the boat and stay short ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
  
Here's to many more profitable GY trades ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

If 1h QQE crosses downwards and a candle closes below 1h gann, expect more bearishness to come.

once the QQE confirms, I would short at 1h 5sma or even 30m 5sma, my SL is always 100 pips and usually it is 1-2% of my account at risk only. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

I know, but I don't feel comfortable anything less than 100 pips SL and I adjust my positions accordingly, I'll move it closer once price starts to move in my favor.

Well i never used any indicators besides MACD to confirm potential divergences with minimum "must reach" targets. I just use my lines to spot possible patterns/formations and trade them. Also im in ADR trading as well, everything i do is based on Igrok's trading style and methodology. But these last days when avarage dayly range is very very much expanded and no clear patterns seen i thought its time to read a little and so here i am @ your thread. Lets see how does your stuff permorm in the battlefield brother

Appriceate your support brother. I would also recommend you to go thru Igroks thread and pop in from time to time. Hes the man when it comes to trading. Ill post when any significant formation pops up infront of me, but these days nothing really significant, so maybe your way of trading in such days can help us out ? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

when GJ trends, the QQE and the gann are the best indicators to use, it is not that bad too in ranging periods but you should go for quick 100 pips or so.

Yes as far as ive seen i agree. We just have to execute our plan precisely and always have a SL and sometimes a reverse order binded with the stop.

Have a look at the 5m chart, the 5m QQE crossed up long time ago but price was just ranging up and down and the QQE came out of oversold levels and now it's ready to cross back down. I took some shorts at 177.85 and once the 5m QQE crosses back down and 1h QQE confirms, I'll add some more shorts.  
  
Target would be a couple of hundred pips but the next significant level is 78.6% monthly fibo at 170.20 but 1st I'd look for a retest of yesterdays low.

Very nice i see what you mean. But to be more safier we can check 1hr timeframe and dont look at lower ones, because even 1/4hour produces enough noise. what you think? Also it looks like this might turn out to be an ascending broadening triangle formation in progress right now. Seems we might get 15m QQE cross up and 15m candle close above gann. That would make you go long Karmo? Or just close your short position? I mean only and if this 15m thing happens.

Yah to be on the safe side, just stick to the 1h/4h and Daily TF, you'll get plenty of pips.  
  
Let's see how the 15m closes, but look at the 4h QQE, it has already crossed up but price is trading below 4h gann, that's a big indication of bearish continuation and it might take a while for it to play out but it is a bearish sign as long as price remains below 4h gann.

correct, but sometimes it gets close to it and doesn't touch it and if I miss the entry, it annoys me like hell lol  
  
so I start scalling in once it is very close to it

Within 20-30 pips understandable.

If 15 min QQE cross up and we get a candle close above 15m gann, would you engage a long position? Yes i see 4hr QQE. I think some pattern ir beying constructed. I see broadening triangles on GJ, EJ and UJ.

maybe, but I see bearish setup on 5m and IMO it should play out. You could take a long if u get a 15m signal but I don't feel safe going long unless for a scalp.

Karmo,  
  
Do you think GJ might test yesterday lows 174?

yep but I see a bearish flag on 5m/15m charts so I'm not going long, will wait for the flag to break.

Yes its possible. Im observing a possible ascending broadening formation. Still its only my wild guess, so lets wait and see what NY brings.

Look at the monthly chart, draw a fib from a low of 129.32 to the high of 241.06  
  
when it started retracing on the monthly chart, we had a 78.6% retracement  
  
Now draw a fib from 148.19 low and high 251.07 , the 78.6% fibo is at 170.21 and that **could** be our next and last stop.

my earlier short got stopped out, but price is still within the bear flag and now we just had the Feds intervening.  
  
I'm gonna stay aside for a bit and see what develops.

Yes. Actually if you see there was a buy signal on USD/JPY 1 hour 15 mins ago on the touch of the ascending broadening triangles LTL in confluence of todays dayly opening, so we could have bought all JPY crosses at once and would ended up in lovely profit. Just something to check ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

It's amazing how Price still reacts to that 4 hour Gann even with news. Wow.

If price remains below 4h gann and we get the 1h QQE to cross down, that would be very bearish because the 4h QQE has already crossed up much earlier on but price not able to get above 4h gann, if this scenario plays out then expect a new low.

Price remains trading below 4h gann but 4h QQE is already crossed up, this is an indication of strong bearish continuation as long as price remains below 4h gann hilo. The confirmation is once the 1h QQE crosses downwards.

Karmo, did you always use 1H for the confirmation..?  
what about small tf like 15M or 30M?

You can but in this situation I'm waiting for the 1h QQE because looking at the 1h chart, you can see that supporting trendline, price is currently bouncing a bit off it and I'd like to see price break that as well. IMO if 1h QQE crosses down then that TL is going to break also.

Just came back from the gym and saw that we had 15m QQE crossed down and candle closed below 15m gann. Was nice and easy 250 pips. Damn, im so unlucky these days. Always missing nice trades with bad timeing![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f621.png?v=15.1) After closing the short trade on the broadening formations LTL, we could have gone long and that would yielded ~150 pips as well.

I set my targets based on S/R levels and fibo levels and TL's.  
  
Yah 1h candle close below gann, but waiting for 1h QQE to cross and the supporting TL to break.

hey karmostaji, i got a question, what's the difference between the bullish/bearish divergence and the hidden divergence? or they're the same? ... if so, which indicator you prefer to use to catch them? macd, rsi or cci?

1h QQE crossed down and TL broke, 174 has been re-tested, if it breaks then 170 is on the table

If price remains below 1h 50ema and 1h Gann hilo, and the 15m QQE crosses back down then GJ should head back down to re-test 174 and maybe break it.

I never really tried scalping GJ, I'm going to try scalping using the 5m and 15m QQE and Gann hilo, in addition to the 50ema, 200ema, 100sma, and ofcourse the 5sma. Targeting 30-50 pips only

can you tell us the strategy you use for scalping? because it seems to be interesting!

I have a question: What is the significants of the 5sma on the Hilo Gain?  
  
I know we wait for the candle to close above or below the gain, for confirmation of either buy or Sell.   
  
But not sure where the 5sma comes into play, and how to use it correctly with the Hilo Gain ??  
  
Thanks for your assistance in advance.

i can answer that question if i may, 5sma plays a good role to tell you when to enter the trade, since price tends to stay very close to its 5sma your best entry should be right at it, another thing you could use 5sma for is, when the market is in an upside movement and the momentum for the new candle is pointing down then price is likely to retrace its 5sma. 

I recommend you read something else as this sentence is now concluded.

> i can answer that question if i may, 5sma plays a good role to tell you when to enter the trade, since price tends to stay very close to its 5sma your best entry should be right at it, another thing you could use 5sma for is, when the market is in an upside movement and the momentum for the new candle is pointing down then price is likely to retrace its 5sma.

Lets say the 1h QQE is crossed up and a candle is formed above, so the hourly trend is up  
  
now let's go to the 15m, if the 15m QQE crosses down much earlier and then after 4-5 candles it closes below gann, that's an indication of bullish continuation, so I would wait for the 15m QQE to reverse back up and enter long.

OK, I want to make sure I really understand this .. you have alluded to this pattern many times.   
The 1h QQE is crossed up and a 1h candle closes above the gann (opens & closes above? or just closes above is OK?)  
Now watch the 15m and if QQE crosses down and 4-5 candles later (on 15) a candle closes BELOW the gann ... that means bullish continuation??  
So you wait for the 15m QQE to reverse back up to enter long.  
  
It seems contra-indicative that you watch the 15m for QQE to cross down AND a candle to close below the gann ... that would seem to indicate a change of direction from bullish to bearish ... see what I mean?

I know what you mean, here I'll give you a better example  
  
Let's say 1h QQE crosses upwards and the 1h candle closes above the 1h Gann at the same time or 1 candle delay  
  
now if you want to know the 15m chart is going to continue upwards or not, sometimes you will notice the 15m QQE crossing downwards and after the cross by 4-5 or so candles a candle will close below 15m, but remember the QQE closed much earlier, so price might keep jumping up n down around the Gann until the QQE is ready to cross back up, once you see the 15m QQE crossing back up and a candle is above the gann, the bull-run will continue.  
  
Look back on your charts, you will find this same exact situation I just explained. 

Trade what you see, not what you think.

I agree with you.., that is very valuable information!  
perhap we should collect every Karmo's posting about QQE and Gann, and then put it in e-book ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
  
  
this Karmo strategy is simple and looks great, but I still need more practice to get used to..  
and always taking Karmo Patience pills before open the chart lol..

i got a question for you, what if 15 QQE crossed downwards at the same time the candle closed below Gann HiLo but 5 candles later price went above Gann HiLo again while QQE is still crossed downwards, will that indicate a possible bearish continuation?

That happens, that is why I keep track of the 15m QQE and 1h QQE just to know the main direction, and use a stop-loss.

Hi Karmo,  
Thanks for taking the time to run a thread and answer questions.  
I have been using QQE for a while now together with fibonacci levels/clusters etc.   
  
I like the QQE Gann HI LO system that you are using on the 5 min GJ and followed it yesterday and took a couple of winning trades and one losing one.  
  
As I understand it the candle has to close above/Below the Gann with the QQE cross taking place at the same time or close to it. THe QQE has to close and if price has moved significantly away from the 5 min SMA, then I must wait until price retraces close to the 5 sma to take the trade.  
  
Is this correct? and is there a defacto stop loss used or some other way of calculating it? I have heard 20 pips mentioned which seems a tad tight on this pair.  
  
Any way Thanks for your input on the FF forum, its good stuff. That Friend of yours Lilmoe also seems to be a bit of a genius too!  
  
Kind Regards,  
  
Nigel  
PS I thought the GJ was wild until I saw reference to the Euro/Aud! 1-2,000 pips a day. Gulp

scapling requires same conditions for h4 and 1h charts should meet 15 and 5? or on 15 and 5 no need for QQE to cross above 50 line? and please check if the following was a valid signal or invalid one: [http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...stcount=121147](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=2272544&postcount=121147)

Price is still trading within the 1h bear flag, and we just had a 1h QQE cross down and a candle closes below 1h gann but would like to see the lower TL break first.  
  
I'm still bearish on GJ and should see a re-test of the lows and there's a high possibility of a new low.

Hi Karmo, I was just wondering real quick if you could lead me to where I can learn more about gann lines and qqe. I'v been using MT4 for about a month and I am looking for more teachings. I've read the begining of your thread but as I am new to MT4 I am unsure of how to install and set up your method. I've been trading demo for about a year and half and I am looking for more solid method.  
  
thanks for your time

> Hi Karmo, I was just wondering real quick if you could lead me to where I can learn more about gann lines and qqe. I'v been using MT4 for about a month and I am looking for more teachings. I've read the begining of your thread but as I am new to MT4 I am unsure of how to install and set up your method. I've been trading demo for about a year and half and I am looking for more solid method.

I'm not Karmo, but . . .   
  
The best place to learn more is right here on Karmo's thread.   
  
You could go to Aus's thread and web site here <http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=40582>  
  
Karmo keeps it simple and easy to understand.   
  
Remember that Karmo's main focus is on higher time frame charts (Daily and Weekly). He's Money Management can realize large stop losses, 300-400 pips or more.

I'm waiting for London to open before I start trading, plus today Many banks are on holiday so we have a thin market, so price is going to whipsaw.

Price could reach 174.15 and we could still be in the bear flag, so please enter once there is confirmation and always use a stop-loss. As long as price remains in this flag, I'll scalp and once it breaks out, I'm gonna ride the beast ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

How do you define it so precisely .. 174.15? ... I don't see any particular reason to choose that level as end of bearish flag. Is it a fib retracement?

Hmm .. well I just drew those parallel lines on my chart to match yours and the top lines ends at 175.40 ish .. so 174.15 is near the top, but I still don't know why you ended it right there (I know, give or take a few pips .. but why ... unless it is a time factor .. the upper tl crosses the 174.15 line just above the current candle on the 1h .. whereas where the tl reaches 175,40 it would be several candles (hours) later .. is that it?

Maybe you drew it differently, I don't know but 174.15 is also a good S/R level so yah I'll pay attention to that level.

Nice descending broadening formation on RSI 15m and looks like we might have seen the top, but it can go aither way. Check it out.

By broken you mean it should break through the lower tl that you drew for the bear flag? Around 170?

You just need practice, and then you'll spot similar patterns everywhere and on every TF, the more you practice, the easier it gets so keep on practicing 

Trade what you see, not what you think.

Karmo, lets say we might have a bearish cross on 15m right now. So you would enter on 5sma retracement or as the crossover was confirmed after and target how many pips with what size stop? thanks

15m QQE crossed down earlier but price has not been able to close below 15m gann, this is an indication of bullish continuation for now, but price is still within the bearish flag.

Hello karmo,take a look about this chart.as u can see we are very close 2 history support line that broke down at 179.30-179.50.and now,after 2 weeks of rally down i think is going to 38.2 fibo b4 it will continue down.

No bearish cross on my 15m QQE... Well its very risky to take 20-60 pips with 100 sl thats what im thinking, no?

Maybe you are right, price is currently above 4h gann and the next resistance on the 4h chart is the 4h 50ema 177.70 area

174.52 is the weekly pivot  
175.30 area is the UTL of the bear flag  
176.00 is the monthly TL  
  
Lots of resistance above

Yes indeed. Last time price touched the monthly TL from the downside on the 9th this month, price bounced hard for more then 1k pips. We now have the similar situation as last time, as price is channeling up in possible bear flag/ascending channel.

I use the same strategy but I use 5m/15m charts for scalping, everything is in this thread. There are many examples available and charts as well.  
  
The same strategy can be applied on any TF, you can test it out.

Any thoughts as to direction from here?  
Perhaps a retrace to weekly pivot then more upside (before more downside)?  
  
All major pairs seem to have similar patterns, if there is follow through in the US market today, which I suspect there will be since everything is heavily manipulated now .. then GU, GY, EU could retrace just to build up steam before another push up.

4H TL Broken, re-test and now heading to 50% and 61.8% fibo levels  
  
The Major (Daily/Weekly) trend is still down IMO.

Next targets are 50% 181.70 and 184.50 61.8%, plus we have the weekly 5sma close to 61.8% so yah keep an eye on that level.  
  
If those don't stop the bulls, then 190.50 where we have a daily TL and 78.6% fibo.

You need to copy them in your MT4 experts > indicators folder and then restart your MT4

You can right click on the indicator, choose Save As and save it to your MT4 folder: C://Program Files/YourMT4Program/experts/indicators.  
  
There are 2 indicator folders, make sure it goes into the one under experts.  
  
If it is in a zip file, either extract it to that folder, or just drag it there (not the zip file, the indicators)

Price looking to close below gann on 1h, qqe crossed down, RSI coming off the 70 level .. lots of bearish action here as well.

the 1h QQE suggests bullish continuation as long as price remains above 4h gann  
  
1h QQE has crossed down but price is currently above 1h gann, so it looks like the QQE is getting itself out of overbought levels and then we'll have another push up towards the 61.8% fibo  
  
if 4h QQE crosses down n a candle close below 4h gann, then bears will be back strongly!

Just a few minutes to go on 1h and it is well below the gann. 4h gann still pretty far away tho.

yah I know, for more downside 177.8 needs to break otherwise the bull-run will continue once the 1h QQE is ready to cross back up.

177.27 is where monthly R2 crosses with a down tl from Sept ... if it breaks that point, that would be weak .. also 4h gann might meet it there.

Damn I love you Karmo. I've made more money using the QQE's and Gann method in the past two days than I did all last week. Thanks man! If I see any setups while I'm lurking, I'll post charts for a heads up on opportunities. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f911.png?v=15.1)

There's possibly a 5 minute opp. coming up which I'd be targeting the 50 ema on a break above the gann line. I would, of course, take less however. Trading is all about protecting the gains that you've made, no matter if it is 20 pips or 100. This is ONLY and I mean ONLY if we break above the Gann line.

Everything is setting up perfectly if the daily candle closes bearishly as a pin. We've seen the 50% retracement today, which is not coincidentally where the resistance from the Gann line kicked into play as well. Price rejected nicely, and IF we see that bearish daily close, shorts should be the way to go.   
  
If your a more conservative trader, waiting for the 4 hour QQE's and Gann line to break down would be the best way to go IMO.   
  
As you can see, things are still Iffy until we get confirmations from the charts.   
  
Don't think, instead you just need to react.

I;m waiting for a retracement to the 5 sma now for that 5 minute entry before going long in order to gain the best price. If we don't see it, oh well, no trade for me until we do and price is reasonable (40's).

Sure thing. We got to the 50 ema and I took profit there.   
  
You'll notice on your 15 minute charts we saw a bearish pin coming off the gann line on the last close and the QQEs are still down. This is telling me to stay short from here. I'll be adding to the shorts on a 5 minute close below the Gann line and QQE cross down as well. I think I will be holding onto these for a while, although I will be setting myself into profit quickly in case this news upsets the market.

Here's that 5 minute close. Now we need to wait for the QQE to cross, a confirmation candle and Hopefully a retracement to the 5 sma.

Once 4h QQE crosses down and we get a candle below 4h gann, this beast should tank downwards..

Above and below the Gann lines, or if my take profit hasn't been hit and price reverses to the opposite- a cross above or below- I will reverse the position. Occasionally, if I see a solid wall of S/R, I will place stops above or below that point.  
  
The 5 minute will give you whipsaws occasionally, especially in a range. The 15 minute, however, shows less whipsaws and more profit potential. The higher up the timeframe you move, the better chances for larger profit there are.  
  
Karmo may trade differently, and if he does, go with his way of doing things. He is the KING with this method. I'm just a peon lol Karmo, do you trade the 5 and 15 minute differently?

Ok Mike, That's great thanks. I like this Gann QQE.scheme. It's very effective.

Very much so. I've made more in the past two days than I did all last week trading the price action alone. Ridiculous. I still trade other methods, but I'm really enjoying adding this to my repertoire after a long time of studying and sitting on the sidelines with it.

Price also couldn't close above the monthly TL on the Daily chart, if price can't get above that then that's a good strong bearish sign.

Karmo, what is your variable smoothing do you use for QQE? 5,10 or 12..?  
what is the different between that number..? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
i see my chart, I think we already have Candle below Gann 4H, QQE 4H cross down (if using smoothing 5),but if use smoothing 10, QQE did not cross yet.

4H QQE crossed down and price is trading below 4h gann, sell rallies  
  
My target is 166 which is the previous low.

If you change your opinion, let us know in here ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
At this point it would take a change on the 4h, close above gann etc to signal a possible reversal, right?

I think he would say that the 4h needs to close above the gann.  
  
He should be back around London open and can clarify then.

after staring at a naked chart for a little while, it looks like we are starting to form some kind of bear flag on the daily chart, have a look at this chart

According to that chart it could go all the way to 188 or so before resuming the downtrend .. is that what you think?

if the daily QQE crosses upwards and we get a candle close above daily gann then it's possible but for now I see still a retest of 166 if 1h QQE crosses back down.

I'm still expecting 166 but we've got some levels to cut through first, I want the 1h QQE to cross down and a candle to form below 1h gann, that should take it down.

If the 1 hr closes below the gann and qqe moving down, on a scale of 1 to 10 how probable do you think it is that it then goes to 166?  
  
I'm not going to trade off this and I know it is just your opinion and you could be dead wrong, but I am just wanting to know your take on the degree of probability once the gann-qqe conditions are setup correctly for a short (and I know numerous other conditions for this particular short have already been met)  
  
And btw, are you an American (or Brit) living in Dubai? Or are you native to that part of the world, and if so .. how did you learn such fluent english??

Yes, the US is the most backward country in the world in that regard. We should be teaching Spanish from grade 1 and adding in a language like arabic or chinese in grade 7. We are insane.  
My kids were raised in Europe, so they all speak 2 languages, a couple of them know 3 or 4.

Hey, Karmo.  
  
I have seen the momentum indicator period set to 1, 10 and 14 sometimes all right on top of one another.  
  
In reading content here i have seen reference to weekly, daily, 4 hour and more time frames.  
  
Do you use all of these periods and time frames? I did some searches and couldn't find a specific answer to my question. In your posts i think i see more references to H4 and daily time frames but i don't want to make assumptions.  
  
Thanks!  
  
Jay

Food for thought...  
  
Doing a fib from the previous high of 197.4 to the low of 166.6 it retraced first to the 50, then dropped to the 38.2. Now it has found support/ resistance under the sma200 / 30m.  
  
Does anyone think this might continue down?

yes once the retracement is over, price is still bouncing between the retracement fib levels

Price bounced off the 78.6% fibo but we have a weekly candle close below the monthly TL and this last week it retested the TL and this might it might head back down if the monthly TL is truly broken.

The Daily QQE suggest bearish continuation, sometime last week the daily QQE started crossing upwards but price has not been able to close above the daily gann hilo, if the 4h QQE crosses downwards and the bear flag breaks, bearish continuation will definitely continue and price will go below 166.

The 179.20ish level is a very strong PPZ.

Hello, Karmo.  
  
I have seen 10 period momentum on your chart. Do you bother with 1 and 14 period momentum?  
  
Thanks in advance.

see bro, here's the problem that i always have, when i have a confirmed signal and price is above/below a trendline i just dont know whether i should enter now or i should wait 'till the trendline is broken, and when i see the break happening i just cant determine whether its too late or its a true break out, do you have anything helpful bro? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f615.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/2753.png?v=15.1)

You're not alone here.  
  
I personally went short when it appeared we had broke support. Unfortuantly, this never played out.  
  
Here is what I am doing right now.  
  
I closed my short and I am long with a SL and a Sell order below the new level of support. However, I made my SL/Sell order further than usual for a larger break of that support level.  
  
Now, what I **really** hope happens is that I can ride long to the DP or higher, then sell rallies.  
  
Hope this helps.  
  
B

I know what you mean, QQE's are suggesting of bearish continuation, so I would suggest you to enter short once the TL breaks on a 5m chart and use a SL just in case it was a fake one, but the QQE's don't lie and they tell me the TL will break soon.

I like to see a strong break at the 174.00 which is a 4 hour PPZ.

Pretty much integrated your QQE/Gann elements into my system... working great. THANKS!  
  
Do you ever use limit orders to enter on retrace to the 5SMA?

Yah I do use limit orders at times, especially with the 4h/daily retrace.

Beautiful, I have so much green pips around me... I'm floating ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
  
More green pips to come, I'm selling rallies until I see a reversal.

Hi Karmo!  
  
I have moved into the new house and the technical stuff seems to be up and running now ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1) You never know!  
  
There is a big Bullish Butterfly on the GJ and a Bullish Crab on the GU (which is playing out better right now). There might be room for a retracement to the 165.00 and 1.65 levels respectively.  
  
Later on I am sure we reach the 15X.XXs ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Ciao!

Hey Matt,  
  
It's good to see you posting again.  
  
I know I see the bullish butterfly, we will get a good retracement only if we get a candle close above 1h gann hilo otherwise this beast is heading straight into the 15xx.xx zone soon.  
  
Bears are in total control.

wait for 163.21 break and trade above it.  
  
It will be a sweet 169 if it breaks, as tp 1, tp 2 could be 173 area.

we had a 4h doji and the next candle started acting bullish so I thought it was going up, but it didn't and it just retraced to 4h 5sma so I reloaded shorts when 5m QQE reversed back down. I'm sticking with shorts and ultimate target is 148-149

what i was trading when i entered long was the charts but the signs i had werent clear, 1 thing i noticed in you and i regret twice a week for not doing the same is that you never trade against the main trend unless there's a clear sign! good luck in your trading bro

What's crazy is that Ronald Reagan actually had an Astrologist that he used to consult for his personal life. It is claimed he did not use the Astrologist for policy decisions but...

I know .. that was happening to me as well in the other thread, so many there keep trying to pick bottoms and screaming ' buy buy' .. I lost some pips believeing them ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
Now I've learned to filter the noise in there, some I have on ignore, others I pay attention to because they are good traders, but I do not follow all their trades because they are trading very differently from the way I can. For example, if you have a huge account you can have both long and short positions and hold onto them through huge drawdowns ... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f633.png?v=15.1)  
  
I've found that between karmo's knowledge of qqe & gann and his patience pills, that is the safest way to trade for the longer term. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Hello Imad,   
You can read post number 1 , download the template and indicator, you will then know why he takes his trades and you can follow his psots at the same time, i guess its the easiest way to learn

Ok maybe not starting yet lol, if we get a 1h candle close below the gann, the downtrend will resume.  
  
It looks bearish again.. so I got stopped out of my longs for some green pips

Hi Karmo,  
  
Checking in from e46f.c from the DOW thread.. Looks like you are doing a great job! Keep it up bro! I will be following your technique and hopefully learn a lot from it!

Karmo, Congrats on your innumberable Pip count! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1) Very good show!!!  
  
Beginning of this week I, after extensive reading (about a month) on this thread and the Aus thread, I decided to implement your trading strategy on this beast. I've been lurking for longer!  
  
10/21 @ 1500 I closed in on many pips using your strategy! I shorted at @ 173 and TP at 161 on several positions and of course, shorted the bounces to R! So even more PIPS! Excellent strategy and thread!  
  
To all who are fluent in Geppy, IS this the norm environment? Or is this a freak of the world economic troubles? Sorry that I'm gettin' all fundamentals on you!![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f62b.png?v=15.1) I know this Thread is about the K strategy but this kind of activity, if consistent, makes me drool ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f924.png?v=15.1) !!!!

Maybe not a bottom but maybe a stall or retrace.

30m QQE crossed up and a candle formed above gann, valid long signal. I'll add on any retrace ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

We might see a retrace back to the weekly 5sma or close it, but first price needs to get back above 1h gann and 4h gann.

I'm expecting bearish continuation in the short-term as long as price remains below 4h Gann hilo, the 4h QQE has crossed up days ago and this is an indication of bearish continuation to me. For now price is trading between these 2 trendlines, I expect it to break lower at some point. If it breaks 150.5 then we should see 154

Price is already above 4h gann, so bulls should take over for the short-term and we should see 4h 50ema in the coming sessions, that is around 159  
  
btw the 38.2% fibo is 154.3 and 50% 159  
  
from my experience, this beast loves the 50% fibo retracements.

I think Karmo needs to take Ben Bernanke's job! Within a month, Karmo can have that 700 billion up to 700 trillion!!!  
  
Pay all US national debt, own all the banks and take a small % off of that for himself for his HARD work!

Unbelievable accuracy. I wouldn't have believed this if I hadn't read it myself. what a trade!  
As I write , price is settling nicely on that 50 ema just like you said. Wow I'm in awe of this!

Just woke up to see target hit, nice.  
  
I see a bull flag forming but price could head towards the daily 5sma or close to it first and then continue upwards towards 61.8% fibo, but be cautious coz the 4h charts looks toppy for now.  
  
btw, thanks guys for the kind words, appreciate it ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

I have hunch about today ... the dj volume (futures) look low on a wide spread bar . I think they only cut rates by .5% tomorrow so up at your targets looks for shorts. I believe today may have been a bull trap .   
  
  
I am aiming for 160 / 161 tonight and looking for potential reversals off that level

Price is in a kinda big bull-flag, look at the 15m chart  
  
Remember price is still above 4h gann, if the bull flag breaks we might see 159 again and maybe 61.8% fibo at 163.8 but if it goes below 1h 50ema then I don't know what will stop the beast from diving down. 

Trade what you see, not what you think.

Bull flag broken to the upside as expected  
  
we should see a retest of 159 and then 61.8% at 163.8 as long as price remains above 4h gann hilo.

Daily gann is at 162.8 so if today we close above that, then the bottom is in for the time being and GJ will head higher coming days/week  
  
I'm just saying, trade the chart.

Let's think a little bit more long-term  
  
If today we close above the daily gann (162.8) and the QQE crosses upwards, then we have a bottom for the time being and price will move higher.  
  
Now let's draw a fib from 215.8 to 138.99, 38.2% n 50% would be my first targets.  
  
This scenario will be valid IMO only if we close above daily gann and daily QQE crosses upwards.

If we don't get above daily gann and the 4h QQE reverses down today/tomorrow then we don't have a bottom yet and GJ should move lower n make a new low.

we saw a retest of 159 today and a little higher, as long as **price remains above 4h gann hilo** , longs are good. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

The daily gann is at 165, if we close today above that level then I would target 180's  
  
but what I think will happen is that we will go back down and make a higher low  
  
If price goes below 4h gann, shorts are back on and they'll be powerful  
If prices goes above daily gann, bulls will tear everything apart  
  
until then take what you get 

Trade what you see, not what you think.

hello bro, i know that you dont trust divergances but we have a bearish div on daily, RSI CCI and MACD, last time we had those 3 indicators indicating div we was as high as 250, just a thing to keep it in mind. 

I recommend you read something else as this sentence is now concluded.

Price bouncing off daily gann hilo, if we get a 4h QQE cross down and a candle forms below then bears will come out full force and most probably we will see a new low coming weeks.

haha! i dont fully trust them and here's one of the reasons, if we were in a trending market and the market is waiting a fundamental release or something to decide something, you'll have a divergance indicating a reversal, once you step in and the fundamental release comes with the trend, ur account will be wiped in a blow! so far, the strategy you're following is the best i've seen for longterms but i keep an eye on divergances just to boost certainty or to decide whether to enter or no in case we have a re-newed signal from QQE.

That is not a classic bearish signal, it is a weak one to me, price might drop to the 1h 50ema and bounce  
  
The trend will become bearish and confirmed only if 4h QQE crosses down and we get a 4h candle closed below 4h gann.

Thanks Karmo.So Actually we should only take the trades with H4 TF?  
I mean just only H4 Gann changes?I've seen before you enter trades with H1.

4h TF is more reliable, but I do follow lower TF's but what I mean was that this 1h bearish signal was not a strong one because the QQE crossed down earlier and after 3 candles or so we had a candle close below the gann, this is usually a sign of bullish continuation but before bulls continue upwards we might see price test the 1h 50ema.

if 1h QQE crosses back up and a candle forms above, and daily candle closes today/tomorrow above 165 then my targets for starters are 168.2 and 175

M15 QQE crosses and GANN changes in the same candle.Isn't it a strong bullish sign?

Yes it is, a good entry would be to wait for price to retrace to 5sma

If you want to be safe, wait for 1h QQE to cross up and a candle to form above 1h gann ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

karmo - if i'm not mistaken, for the 15min long signal, the target is 1hr Gann, which is 162.5 in this case.  
  
is the next target the 4hr 100 EMA?

Hey there Karmo glad to see you are doing well. Have a quick question for you do you think the speculation of a jpy rate cut has been priced in? If not this could move big time to the upside no?

The BOJ can do whatever it wants, I honestly don't pay too much attention.

I usually move stoploss to breakeven once i'm up 100 pips and then move it higher manually every 80 pips or so  
  
every person uses a different strategy, maybe u want to take half partial profits and set sl to be for the rest, i dunno.. its up to you how to manage your trade

100 pips is lovely  
  
Yep thats correct, the 1h QQE crossing up and a candle closing above 1h gann would be an excellent opportunity to go long

take the link from the first post of this thread and save the to ex4 to your metatrader-directory in the subfolder experts/indicators. Then save the tpl file in the subfolder templates and there you are. In MetaTrader choose Templates->Auslance. Voila!

Hi Karmo,  
Please go back to the old image. It gives an impression of your readiness to dismantle the beast GJ.  
  
Which version of QQe do you use on MT4. I saw V4 and V5 on Auslanco thread, both are virtually same. I downloaded the V5. I do not get the crosses the same time as you following your posting. when you say QQE crossing I presume its e 50 line mark. Thanks

Daily QQE has crossed for up, will this carry any weight? Daily Candle is bouncing from gann HL.  
  
Also, you mentioned a good entry is wait for 1hr to retrace to 5 SMA, now is has went beyond, and the lower TFs are still working for the up, do you make you entry now or you will wait for the lower TF to complete the cycle.  
  
What is your initial SL at entry?

Dailly QQE crossed up but price continues to trade below daily gann, this is usually a strong bearish continuation sign, plus we have a 4h bear flag on GJ.  
  
I would wait for the lower TF's to complete their cycle and then enter when most TF's align together and point in one direction.  
  
My SL most of the time is 100 pips.

When waiting for price to trace back to the 5SMA, how do you know determine if price will not pierce it and go the opposite direction?

Nowadays it is hard since GJ swings like crazy, but we still got to manage the risk otherwise this beast will eat us alive.

I use the momentum with 5sma to track retracements to 5sma but yes sometimes price might pierce through it by 20-30 pips, maybe more I dunno, that's why I use a 100 SL just in case it reverses.

I am a EUR/JPY trader too...I guess EJ and GJ has similar amount of swing at a time, as a 30-40 pips move is a normal...

Ok here's my simple analysis, GJ is in a bear flag IMO on the 4h chart, and on the 1h chart we see a bull-flag lol, so if the bull flag breaks then 166 should be a good resistance and once the bear flag breaks then I'm expecting new low's. Another thing the Daily QQE has crossed upwards but price remains to trade below daily gann, that's an indication of bearish continuation to me.

162.30 is the Daily gann, if a daily candle manages to close above this level today then yes bulls will be back for a while.

What I see is this..  
  
price is above 4h Gann, if 4h QQE crosses up then that's a bullish sign and we will end most probably with a daily candle above daily gann, another bullish sign.  
  
upper TLT of the 4h channel is around 174  
200ema on 4h is 173  
50ema on daily is 175.5  
  
This is valid only if price doesn't break 159.5 (LTL of the channel), if it does then most probably new low's.  
  
This is my simple plan ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

are you sure that we're not going to reach 141 before the upside move? 

I recommend you read something else as this sentence is now concluded.

The upside move is valid as long as price remains above the LTL 4h chart which is now around 159.5  
  
If that breaks then we're going fast n hard.

17x.xx is possible as long as price remains in this channel, we have some fibo level that could be good TPs for longs.

on VT charts, price never closed above 4h gann, but I see on IBFX it has, it would be best if you wait for 4h candle to close below 4h gann and then once it retraces to 5sma or close to it, you can enter short.

Most of the time they are similar on VT n MT4, but I would say yah VT is more reliable to me.

Karmos, I've trusted yr strategy and have left my trade to run since Friday without stop-lost. As long as it does not break the 100ema, it's fine wt me. It may be risky but gann & qqe confirmation shows the direction and that's where it will go. Prior to this, I've lost for not trusting the signals & yr suggestion.  
  
Thnx again.

A close below 155.5 and GJ will tank, most probably a new low this week.

I figured karmo just held onto his falcon's legs and it flew him to his destination.

We should see a new low in the coming days, GU will most probably be making a new low as well.

Classic breakout trade as well. The touch of the 5 sma on the 4hour and then heading down help confirm my entry at the break of 156.00 at 155.95.

Picking bottoms (or better said) a retrace should be done with more reasons then just "Wow, it dropped 550 pips its gotta retrace now". I'm not saying you have done this sonic, but I've see traders that have. Some obvious S/R levels and/or reversing Price Action would be a better bet. 

Indicators show the past. Price Action "Indicates" the future.

Getting some pip distance past the 154.50 would be nice.

Bad entries and your margin cannot hold? Oh boy, you are using bad money management for sure and over-leveraging, Bad!  
  
You need to step back and look at what you are doing.

I add on retracements and then close some for a couple of hundreds, then re-load again n so on, but I keep my shorts from the top or breakout which in this case is my shorts from 160 ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Hey Karmo, hows it going. Do you know how rare it is to have a weekly chart with the possibility of a double inside bar. Better check out the G/J Weekly. Got a nice one forming right now. See below.

I've got 1 short bleeding and the rest in profit with SL set in profit  
  
If price manages to close above 1h 50ema with an hourly candle, I'll exit shorts otherwise I'm remaining a bear.

I'd like to see the 15m upward channel to break downwards and a 30m QQE cross down with a candle close below 30m Gann.

well its the mystery indicator the one that draws the lines and the end target was the 610 line and nothing more than that.  
  
and i will be opening a fresh short from the 610 line since 4 hour is still a downtrend.  
  
my target will be the 987 line or 155.18  
  
could be more, depending on how 4 hour plays put.

I recommend you read something else as this sentence is now concluded.

you can choose the leverage, 200:1 , 100:1 etc...  
spreads are okay until news time, they are widened at news time and very volatile times.  
Dunno about scripts but you can run EA's

I haven't seen 100s, definitely less.. 10-20 on normal news but if things get crazy, i've seen 40-50  
  
the 10 might be once a day, sometimes nothing at all, it depends

Hey, Karmo.  
  
I am still getting comfortable with this indicator and have a question. I see reference to QQE crosses on the M5, M15, M30, H1 and H4 timeframes. Do you still utilize all these time frames? What about Day or Week?

Generally, from what I have observed on the forum from Karmo and others and comparing it to my own charts, H4 is the big one to look at. Here is what I understand:  
  
QQE cross on![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1)Higher the TF, the stronger the signal)  
D Good for overall confirmation of trend  
4H Agree   
1H Agree  
30M Agree  
  
Gann ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1)Candle 0 clearly above or below)  
D Good for overall confirmation of trend  
4H Agree  
1H Agree  
30M Agree  
  
Fib Retracement on the WK, D, H4 and H1 looking for overlap of these to be careful of or exploit strong S/R levels.   
  
Use of the 5 SMA on the 15, 30, 1, 4 TF for re-entry on the dips and bumps to follow the overall strategy. Other MA's such as the 50 and 200 are also used.  
  
Utilize the 4H and D chart for overall channel of price movement. These will also provide a good breakout point keeping in mind the above...  
  
My 2 ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/270c-fe0f.png?v=15.1) cents. If Karmo can expand on this, debunk it, whatever, since I could be dead wrong on almost everything! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61f.png?v=15.1)  
  
I'm not ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f647-200d-2642-fe0f.png?v=15.1) of the Geppy tamer!

my SL was below 4h gann and this position got stopped out.  
  
I'm gonna sit on the sidelines for a bit and see what develops.

If price reaches 154.4 or the LTL of the 4h TL, I'll try a long.. otherwise I'll wait for 30m/1h QQE to turn bullish.

15m QQE crossed upwards with 15m candle close above gann, 1st bullish sign.  
  
If we get a 30m bullish signal, I will take it.

Target is 161 which is the upper TL of the 4h bull-flag, if that breaks then target is the broken monthly TL around 175

We also have a 1h candle close above gann, QQE hasn't crossed yet on 1h TF.

Price went up towards the upper TL 160.80 and bounced  
  
we might be going back down to the lower TL..

On VT, the daily candle has not been able to close above the daily gann but the QQE has crossed up a long time ago, this is a strong indication of bearish continuation.

Meta trader Gann HiLo set to value 12 or 13 seems to agree with VT.

yes it is fact that there're some cases when VT HiLo crosses before MT4, however, the founder of this strategy built it on VT not on MT4. 

I recommend you read something else as this sentence is now concluded.

Karmo,  
  
When you are scalping do you use the Auslanco 1Hr/4Hr but on a smaller timeframe, like 5 min? Or a version of your own system?  
  
I like the Auslanco system but would like to learn a good scalping method.  
  
Thanks, ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Hey Myke,  
  
I'm not a good scalper lol, but I try.. I use auslanco's method on smaller TF like the 5m/15m and try to grab anything from 10-50 pips n get out quick  
  
I need to learn a better scalping method though..

hi karmo   
do you use the bounce on trendlines ?? when i look at your charts it looks so easy to just enter a buy at the lower line and a sell at the upper one .  
thanks

It is easy, price could retest the lower TL again and even the lower TL you see around 152.xx

This is again based on the chart I posted earlier.

LOL nah  
  
I'm relying more on my own TL's I've drawn than the 4h gann because that thing has been all over the place for the past 2 days coz of the ranging. so yah I'm long based on the bounce off the lower TL and 154.4 support

I wouldn't rely on any indicator drawing trendlines, you need to do it yourself, you need practice.  
  
When I first started drawing, I have no clue at all, I just kept trying.. never give up ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
Look at the charts I post and see how I draw them, you'll learn by practice.

If price can't get above 154.40 then back down to 150.50 and if that support breaks then it will tank to 139  
  
Keep it simple, price action is king.

It did and I was short from 154.40 to 150.50 and then back long from there to 154 and now short again.  
  
It's been fun ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

Hi Karmo,  
  
How do you know it will tank to 139 if it breaks 150.50?

I'm waiting for that move down to around 140 to go long, 2:1 lev and no s/l targeting 190 long term.

A close below 1h gann, 50ema, black TL, and 154.50 and shorts will be back and target would be the 4h gann and then the LT of the 4h bull flag around 150  
  
with the gap up we had today, the 4h QQE have crossed up and a candle has formed above 4h gann, this is not truly bullish since it was caused by the gap up, we will have to see.

I wouldn't consider it bullish until we break the 4h bull flag, I saw the chart you posted earlier in the other thread, it's perfect ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Price is having a hard time to close above 4h 50ema  
  
If price can't get above 158/159 then down we go and it will be hard, a break below 150.50 and we will see 139 easily.

A close below the black TL and down she'll go.. 154.40 might be in the way, if it breaks then tanking time.

150.50 is sitting on the Weekly S1, the Daily S1 and the last fractal swing low. Nearly 500 pips away and it's a temptation to go after the pips inbetween .. but that is scalping with lower probablility.  
  
Some traders in another forum I was in (they were sisters, very successful traders, grew up in a trading family) used to say .. wait for the 'perfect storm' setup then CTC it!   
CTC = compound the crap (out of it) ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
  
Instead of going for the smaller pip gains along the way they would wait for the setup where all the stars aligned, then go in with guns blazing .. or in this case multiple lot orders and get the max from the move.  
  
This would be breaking a 1% rule .... but do you use compounding, karmo, when you are very sure of the move?

hi karmo, just one question. if daily qqe is crossed bullish, why do you say new lows are coming? is it because the price cant close above gann? thx. 

Market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.

Hi Karmo,  
  
Would you mind to post the indicator which draw the Daily and Weekly Support and Resistant?  
  
If you have the MT4 version one.  
  
Thanks  
Mike 

Failure, is a wonderful teacher!

Because price can't close above the daily gann.

Yes I do, I add positions after the 1st one is in profit and keep them if I'm expecting a big move coming.

**Compounding Rule explained**  
  
Lets say you are trading with $100 and using 1% to trade you picked up another $100 over time and your balance became $200  
  
Now applying the 1% rule you would be trading with $2,   
  
So, as you profit your compounding amount @ 1% keeps increasing, and with every profit you need to earn less and less pips to reach the next compounding level.  
  
This is called intelligent compounding which actually grows your account at the same time keeping the risk CONSTANT.

sometimes price will retrace only to the 30m or 15m, and after an hour or two it will come and retrace to the 1h 5sma

hi karmo   
when the 4 h close below the gann and the qqe cross down on 4h , do we add a new short ? is it a signal that the bearish is being stronger or no ? since the smaller time frame are already bearish ?  
thanks

not sure if the down move is completed for now, but just trying to be safe.

Hi Karmo,  
Let me say thanks for all your insight in this thread as well as Auslancos..  
  
It seems to me that we're trading in a downward channel for the last while, from 149ish now to 158ish. I'm thinking it will hit around 149.5 then retrace up possibly 156-157?? if it respects the upper and lower channel trend line.  
  
I know you mentioned its going to be a blood bath (on Auslancos thread), so I'm just wondering why you think it is going to break out of the range it has been in?  
  
Thanks

I haven't experienced anything bad from them except for widening the spread during news and very volatile times.

The 4h QQE is crossing back down and a candle is being formed below 4h gann. The price is still below daily gann hilo and QQE is starting to turn downwards.  
  
I see lots of strong bearish signals.

148.8 been reached too  
  
If price breaks 147.7 then it should tank towards 139 and most probably break it and a new low.  
  
I've been selling rallies lately only..

New to trading and just found the thread, looks interesting.  
  
I was wondering when you have moves like this that are hitting levels that go back more than a decade, would you expect a good size retracement before continuing down? How would you calculate the odds / chance that price would break the previous low?

4h QQE has crossed upwards for a bit now but price has not been able to get above the 4h gann, this is usually a bearish continuation sign to me. Price is also still below the daily gann hilo.

Hi Karmo,  
I am a little bit confused here.  
  
As you are waitting for price to retrace to 5 ema in H1 and going long here in M15 price closed below GANN and retraced to 5ema and I am ready to go short.  
  
Price is below 4HR Gann and we could consider the market bearish.  
  
How do you analyse that?  
  
Thanks  
Mike

It will end up ranging up n down if 4h/1h are not agreement with the direction. I will short when a candle closes below 1h gann, as we know the 4h is already bearish.  
  
Plus I see a 4h bear flag with 146 being the UTL of the flag, if price gets there I'll start to short.

Hello Karmo,  
  
Can you check my chart? My 4hr isn't showing bearish. Can you tell me how to fix it?

Ya know, karmo I am slowly beginning to 'see' what you see on the 4h and 1h charts and how it works with thie gann/qqe thing. Not sure why it takes such a long time to learn something so simple but in the beginning, although I understood the rules, I was still not seeing it for myself and missed a couple of the major moves.  
Now when you make your comments, I can follow along and even anticipate them. Hope that will soon translate into a fat account ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
I have a ton of people on ignore in the other thread, not because some of them are not good traders but the constant chatter is becoming very unproductive. One person actually started posting & insisting that the direction was up, up & he was building long positions .. but neglected to say until 20 posts later that he planned to hold for months or years (!)  
  
Others scream up, down, sideways .. but are talking about the tick chart.  
  
What I love about karmo is _consistency:_ if the chart says up, it's up until the chart changes its mind ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1) And I'm beginning to 'see' for myself when that happens...  
  
Good stuff. Please don't go anywhere until I have mastered this ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

now the 4h candle is above gann and 1h below gann, more ranging lol  
  
Actually I'd pay more attention to the 4h bear flag in this case than QQE n gann, I expect the flag to be broken to the downside but we'll have to wait and see.

Most of the people don't know how to use these lovely indicators properly, they can't see the magic behind them.  
  
I've got many people on ignore too, and I don't listen to anyone's call there, I just go through it for fun lol, I trade what my chart and indicators tell me only. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

These 2 days it's been jumping up n down, I'm having a wild ride myself lol  
  
Don't worry, just make sure you use good money management so you wouldn't get hurt much by being stopped out.

Karmo,  
Thanks for all of your contributions to these forums. What hours do you usually trade? I'm getting tired of watching for your posts with all of the silly chatter that goes on in the GY thread and it would be easier if I knew your usual times that you are there. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

I've added a world clock on Dubai time to my collection so I can keep track of when karmo might be prowling...  
  
I see she failed the WP again, she seems to be getting weaker in her attempts to cross the 146 barrier. And the 4h flag is breaking & 1h below gann again .. I think I missed a decent short entry by about 30 minutes.

hi karmo, i have read through this thread. i have been following your trade calls in the other thread. i have already made blunders that have almost wiped out my account. now i only want to take high probability trades only. at least to shore up my account a little. i have downloaded the indicators for the system you trade as well as the template.  
now, i see PA is above gann on 4h but below gann on 1h. QQE is about to cross down on ih ( cross 50 line) but still below 50 line on 4h.but you say bearish continuation? again, there seem to be buying interest in GU. so what should i watch out for? cross of QQE in 1h?

I'm staying out until we break this 4h bear flag  
  
I might try a short from the upper TL of the bear flag but otherwise not trading, price action is not normal lately as well. Price keeps jumping all over the place.

Hey abasiakara, I know what you are going through .. that was my problem for months! Now I am finally figuring out one of the most important lessons: when NOT to trade. And now is that time .. unless you are a confident scalper and/or have some extra play money to play with.  
The trick to finding the high probability trades is to WAIT for them to set up properly & do nothing until that happens.  
You can take as many of karmo's patience pills as you like while waiting ...  
I suggest the candy-flavored ones, keep a bowl by the computer ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

Honestly I would lose money trading yesterday and today, actually I did lose a bit yesterday lol  
  
I suck at scalping and this environment doesn't suite my trading style.  
  
Patience till we get a high possibility trade.

karmo, in the other thread you mentioned 4h gann as support, 1h as resistence .. is this a general rule when price is above 4h and below the 1h?  
Do other factors play into this?

Not a general but price is stuck between the 1h gann and 4h gann, the gann acts as support/resistance.  
  
I need more patience until this breaks out, it's boring..

if this hourly candle closes above 145.30 and 1h QQE crosses up, I'm going to try a long once it retraces to 5sma  
  
Bulls not giving up yet.., this time it might touch 4h 50ema coz it's right there with the UTL of my 4h bear flag.

Its getting pretty close to the top of the 4 hr bear flag Karm. Also the 4 hr 50 and we have a new bear bat (not sure thats what it is called) on the 1 hr. Seems it should retrace a decent amount first.

I know but I'm getting tired of waiting lol  
  
146.50 is tough resistance and the 4h 50ema is definitely getting closer, bears should win this battle IMO.  
  
I'll take some more patience pills.

4h QQE has crossed down and we have a 4h candle close below 4h Gann, strong bearish signal.  
  
The LT of the bear flag is 142.15, a 4h close below that and we should see GJ tank easily.  
  
My target is anywhere between 130-132

Hi Karmo,  
  
Is 142.60 M15 Gann or there is something else to put sell stop order there?

Most of the people there are trading on 1m/5m chart and they're looking for the intraday moves.  
  
Price is still below 4h gann hilo and price tested the broken 4h flag twice now at 142.50  
  
My bias is still down.

where price is at now..  
  
but if we get a 4h close above 4h gann then I would be very cautious coz that would mean GJ turned bullish.  
  
I wasn't expecting such a move today... anyways it's Friday lol

Latest 4h candle closed below gann and well below the 50 ema with QQE crossed up so that is still a bearish continuation. Rgitt sees a retrace as high as 146 by 10 am today... that could be a lovely short if it plays out.  
  
But watch for confirming short signals before shorting at any level IMO ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

It was spooky earlier when price headed past 143 & the usual suspects in the other place were screaming long, long ... but the 4h told its story & I kept the faith. Paid nicely, thanks K. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Definitely, as long as price is below 4h gann, we will see new low's next week ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Hi Traderstar,  
  
Congrat !  
I don't understand when you say QQE crossed up so that is still a bearish...  
  
I was thinking when QQE crosses down it mean bearish  
  
Please advise  
  
Thanks  
Mike 

Failure, is a wonderful teacher!

1h QQE crossed down and a candles are below 1h gann. Bearish sign..  
  
4H QQE suggests bearish continuation.  
  
Price is below daily gann.  
  
139 will not hold, IMO.  
  
Peace

hi Karmo, my first here. this great, pls keep it up.  
my question, is how do i take max. profit, considering that prices bounces off the fib levels and could even go against u, without loosing the possible gains due to price extension beyond the initial fib level.  
  
in case of price breaking thro the first fib level, how do we take advantage and placing more positions.  
  
thanks.

Hi Baby..

I only use it for weekly/monthly trades...i;m still learning to trade intra-day which for now is a pain in the a**..i'm 50/50 win.loss so far on intra-day but hope to pick up more tips on Aus's tread and yours.  
  
oh baby....once again...just brilliant.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60e.png?v=15.1)

Here's what I see for the coming sessions, here's a look at the 4h GJ chart..  
  
If price manages to get above the 4h 50ema and the daily TL (black one) then we should see a good healthy retracement, GJ loves the 50% fibo level where we also see a resistance level. The daily 50ema is around the 88.6% level for now but also keep an eye on it.  
  
If price fails to get above 4h 50ema, then the pressure remains to the downside.

If price stays below the 50 (which it is) but above gann with QQE still crossed up .. it would seem to be a no man's land for trading until price goes below gann and stays there for several 4h bars .. do you agree? I know you are saying as long as price stays below the 50, pressure is to downside, but this is not a place to open new shorts .. right? Need more confirmation?

Hi TS   
  
I would not open new shorts just yet till that bullish div on RSI and hence I think QQE ( do not have indie but thing it is same as rsi) on 4 hr chart is broken . There are some possible bullish signs on different charts right now for a 1000 - 2000 point rally in the dj and hence the GJ , also the usd index is looking to roll over , that would make Gu rally by min 1500 pips. But as i said Friday was a strange day on the markets with options expiry

TS,  
  
I agree with you. I think the charts are telling us there is no clear direction. I'm only playing with very small lots this week since it's a very short trading week and the fact they JPY is closed today.

karmo, would you do this: if price retraces to the weekly pivot/.50 fib and fails, then go short.. and would you do it on a 4h close or a 1h close? Otherwise I see no probability until it takes out the daily S1 which was the last low at 139.56 and it seems a shame to wait until it gets all the way down there.  
This is an academic discussion for me since I will be working tomorrow and travelling all day Tuesday, so will probably not trade this week at all, but I am watching GY as I think this current PA is good for learning how to correctly interpret the qqe/gann when price is bouncing the way it is.

Right, I'd forgotten about JPY closed today .. another reason to sit & watch .. but I think this is a good learning time as mentioned above so I will be watching to see how it plays out ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

I'm currently long from 141.30 since the 4h QQE is crossed up, gotta wait and see if 4h 50ema gets broken or not.  
  
I would consider shorts only if 4h QQE crosses back down and a 4h candle forms below 4h gann.

My target is the weekly 5sma which is close to 148, also the 38.2% fibo  
  
If we get a daily candle close above daily gann (on VT) then we shall see a bigger retrace.

OK, the QQE crossed up some time ago but price was still below gann = bearish continuation. Then on Friday, a candle closed well above gann .. so it looks like you waited for a retrace (to daily pivot and fib?) and then entered long, is that it?  
Once 4h closed above gann, that switched you from short to long bias? So at that point you watch for retracements lower to get in.  
One problem ..... sometimes price moves up & down around the gann .. so at this point you are taking short term trades, ready to get out at any sign of a reversal?

This bearish continuation is still valid as long as price remains below 4h 50ema, you can see the 4h QQE has recovered to the 50 level but price is still below 4h 50ema, so it's not a strong buy signal, now if 4h QQE crosses back down and we get below 4h gann, we shall see new low's.  
  
Plus remember price is still below daily gann, that's bearish.

I've taken shorts from 144 with stops above 4h 50ema at 145

This fascinates me .. why do you pick the weekly 5ma, instead of the daily 5ma or 4h 50 or daily 50 or weekly 10 or .... you get the point .. it seems almost every time there is a different ma on a different timeframe that people are targeting .. how on earth do you decide that?? LOL  
Is it because a certain ma will coincide with something else .. like a fib or pivot point??

lol I'm scalping, waiting to see if 4h 50ema breaks or rejects, if it rejects then would love to see price get below 4h gann coz that will be a strong bearish signal.

Rgitt drew a triangle on the 4h last week that makes sense .. she may be headed to complete that after a detour, that would be around 146-146.50 and then down from there. We shall see.

Interesting .. that agrees with the triangle above ... looks like that 146+ area could be significant.

She's forming a fractal at that 146+ level, right at top of rgitt's triangle ... let's see what's next.   
Definitely a close well above the 4h gann and just now above the daily gann as well .. but I am sniffing something funny about this up move. However if she gets higher with any momentum, then she may be serious about this northbound express.  
  
Keep scalping, karmo .. and keep 'em guessing ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

One thing I know about bear rallies is that they are impulsive. The pros want to sell this thing higher for the ultimate market crash ... the higher they can get it the better value they are paying. This week , with low liquidity in the markets would be the best week to manipulate price up into the lower 150s   
  
The interesting thing is that the UJ is driven by the stock markets , where as the GU not so much. If one looks at the DX ( usd index) we have been forming a top off 88 the usd should get a bit weaker this week , taking Gu and hence GJ higher.   
  
I think we may see some form of retracement of the major down move , maybe even to the 38% fib reatracement on the daily at 160.   
  

I would be interested to see a posting of the a daily chart with gann on it

Karmo,  
  
What happened to you today? You were not online. Did they piss you off, answer only if you want.  
  
I know that you are a longer term trader & I'm trying to learn your style. I have found that your predictions, more times than not, are on target. Over on that other thread (Scalper Thread), everyone is screaming up, down, no wait, up, no no no down.... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f615.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/2753.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f937-200d-2642-fe0f.png?v=15.1)  
  
  
So, what is your take on the GJ?  
  
Thanks,

Vanhook, I couldn't agree more .. I am just not interested in trying to catch every possible pip. Maybe after I have mastered karmo's trading style (which is based on auslanco's) I will check other threads for more ideas .. but probably not. K makes thousands of pips with a very laid back style that nails most moves. As you said, in the other place, it is a cacophony of noise & confusion & frenetic pip-chasing. There may be traders making money, but way too stressful for me.   
Karmo, Dra, Rgitt, Godfrey, and a few others have methodologies that keep you on the right side of moves. If one can master their methods, there will be tons of green pips without spending stressful hours in front of the computer ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

To add to TS's post, do yourself a favor and don't trade the rest of the week. Whenever the US has a Holiday week, especially one on a Thursday, you're going to see strange and erratic price action. I am a PA trader and it is way too volitile to get a grasp of true direction.

I was busying making green pips, price action was nuts yesterday but I stayed bullish until I saw price fail to break 148.  
  
If price manages to get below 4h gann, then my target is 141.50

Plus you can see the 23.6% monthly fibo and the weekly 50% fibo are very close to each other, this should be a good support level. The candle has broken and closed below the weekly lower trendline.

It depends on which TF you are trading, if long-term then Monthly/weekly n daily are best to use. 

Trade what you see, not what you think.

The downside is not confirmed yet, we need a 4h candle close below 4h gann and 4h 50ema.

>  Regarding your question about the 5SMA, this was never part of my method until I came across Auslanco and his method, as he says that it is the 'true price', since I started using the 5SMA to enter the market, it has given me a much much better entry price than I would of entered before. Whenever a retracement starts, watch how price reacts to the 5SMA on every TF, from 5mins to 1H, price keeps testing the 5SMA on every TF until one of them supports/holds, but most of the time it will retrace to the 1H SMA, and it depends on how...

yu talked about price retracement to the 5sma as if its a fixed price. pls can u explain this principle of price retracing to 5sma. how do we determine the price value of the 5sma.

It was confirmed today and target has been hit at 141 ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f973.png?v=15.1), but if today's candle closes below daily gann (143) then we will definitely see a new low in the coming days ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

hi karmo, i manage to grab 200 pips off that 500pip fall.logged in at 144 thought i could join and it paid off. i put in another short at 140.87. i then decided to read up the auslanco thread to know how the market has been. met the usual. up! no down! how can u short at this level? i chickened out and hedged my short trade at 141.36. u can figure out my dilemma now.  
how do i best manage these positions. i can afford a stop loss of 50 pips. at what point do i remove the hedge? 5 min 50ema? will it retrace up to that level? do i just close both positions and take the 68 pip loss? i will be left with 140pips profit so far.please what do you think? any body wants to help? tradedestar are you there?

I don't know what I would do, but the bearish trend is strong and no sign of big retracement yet. It could go lower very soon.  
  
Use a stop-loss and don't hedge, it's better n safer ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

we broke the daily T3, which translates into a mighty big fall underway.  
  
should this become a daily chart trend, we will see new lows.

Happy Birthday  
  
Quick question. I was stopped out with a 100 pip trail. Made 200+ pips so certainly cannot complain. "When to get back in" is something that has troubled me in the past.   
  
Is there something specific you look for before re-entering the same direction?   
  
As always, your sharing of your expertise is greatly appreciated.

Thanks bro ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
If QQE doesn't cross then it's not confirmed, you must wait another candle or more until it does, because price could get back above gann before QQE crossing n u might end up taking a loss.

OK, let me try an analysis here ...  
GY is well below gann on 4 h but still above the QQE  
GU is below gann and QQE.  
  
So I would think the next best short entry for GY would be on a pb to 141-ish, the Daily R1 and .38 fib, if there is little buy pressure at the time. This would also be a 4th retest of that area .. and since daily should close below gann & QQE crossed down today, the next drop could be substantial.  
  
Comments?

The pinkish area is where I would re-enter/add if it gets there with weak upward momentum. Daily QQE is just crossing down and daily may be forming a bearish engulfing.

It helps me to see other people's Fib levels.  
To see if I'm on track or not.

That 141 pullback I was hoping for looks more improbable .. there was a good short entry around 137.40 earlier .. but what's in the crystal ball for the next week .. or two? Any chance of a really decent pullback?

hey girl, its been a while, here're some charts and i hope you sure your thoughts please,  
  
h4 qqe refuses to cross to the downside and daily momentum been recovering while price going down, however, im looking for bullish/reversal signs but its very possible that we'll visit 130-129 before anything interesting happen, for the comming 2 weeks, i'll be looking for break above 140 followed by 147 to confirm the reversal, the rest of details are listed on the chart, good luck  
  
the third edit: break below 129 and this senario will be very invalid, i must get ma coffee ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1)

I agree there is strong resistence to this just taking a dump which it should do, that's why I was hoping for a stronger pullback to the 141ish area as that could give it the momentum into the 120's.   
She's really back in no man's land at the moment, needs to break above 141 or below 129 as you said. Just scalping opps in here.  
  
Have a great weekend!

But first we need to lay the egg, and for that the hen must find a cockerel first.  
  
Anyways, yes there is a strong resistance in this area and plenty of wood to chop before we get anywhere, and the forming chart is suggestive of nothing more than 138.30 for now.  
  
I could be wrong.

Price is above 4h gann, 1h gann, 1h 50ema, so buy dips and first TP is 4h 50ema.

Hiya Karmo!  
  
That would be a close < or > than 139.64 4H 50 ema on my chart. What of the QQE on the 4H chart is upwards since the 2nd of last week. This confirm bull move?

the 4h QQE is bullish for now, but for GJ to be truly bullish, it needs to close above 4h 50ema and break the daily TL at 141

Thanks! I see how you got that daily TL, I've had it up on my chart, but saw it fairly far off. Keep a close eye on it along with the 4H 50 ema.  
  
As always, I'm thankful to you for sharing you experience and insight!

Got that pullback to 141-ish (140.74), sometimes I surprise myself ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
  
Still just observing as I have been on the road, travelling, will probably start trading again today or tomorrow. Now looks like a pb to 138 (convergence of S/R levels & fib) is needed to short again. Or maybe 139 the 4h 50 ema?  
  
While it stays below the daily gann/qqe I still prefer shorting the upward pullbacks, I know our Karmo is morphing into a scalper & works both sides now. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

I've been busy managing accounts n trading, that's why I've been posting less.  
  
We already have a 4h candle close below 4h gann, we need a 4h QQE to cross down, we should retest the lows and possible new low's.  
  
We had a weekly retrace to 5sma and also price bounced off the daily TL.  
  
The big picture remains to be bearish.

Dear Karmo,  
  
I've read through your trading method and followed your posts on Auslanco-GBPJPY form. I am intersted in your trading method. Do I need any additional indicators than the ones mentioned in your first post on this forum?  
  
Also, how do you calculate your stop loss?  
  
Thank you

H4 TF QQE just cross to bear signal. Waiting for the new H4 Candle to form to enter positions.   
  
H1 and 15M TF are in alignment Under Gann and QQE crossed bear...

Dear bro karmo  
  
Thanks for ur reply. I am doing good in life except forex. The problem is I do not have spare time to concentrate on forex hence was looking for someone to handle it as a managed account. Can u let me know on your terms and conditions for the managed account like the account size, broker, profit sharing ratio since I would love you to handle for me the managed account. Take care and god bless

WE have had a nice run to the upside, which I can't explain, but we have hit some major pivot/fib levels. Could this thing be turning around now, that 138.56 has been it. Any Thought Karmo?

IMO this could be the turning point, I'm gonna wait until the 15m QQE crosses down and we get a candle formed below 15m gann, just to feel safer lol, even though the past 2 days this beast has done whatever it wants n didn't respect no indicator nor anything else LOL

That sounds like not only an Excellent Plan, but a Safe one as well. I will follow your lead on this one. I am watching it very closely. These pass couple of days have been a little frustrating.

If the Daily Gann and S/R level 138.50 should meet, we could see more down side. (imo) They may be close enough already to see some down side.

As long as price remains below daily gann (139), the pressure is to the downside

Now above Daily Gann, 135.30, and rising... QQE still hasn't crossed up on D.  
  
H1 and H4 still below Gann and crossed down...M30, M15, M5 pointing up....  
  
Need them to line up.... like shooting ducks!

here's the same old Auslance EA (first introduced by Godfreyh) with few things added and some bugs fixed,  
  
Added:  
1\. Divergence filter  
  
2\. Max bar length allowed based on calculating the average moves for the currenct season for the last x days but we have allowed the user to choose the deviation like max = average*deviation, so if diviation is 2 then the max length is twice as the average.  
  
3\. we have added automated-optimization for QQE and GanHiLo parameters so that the parameters are changed according to the market conditions.  
  
in order to set up the automated-optimization you must do the following steps:  
  
1\. "copy" the terminal folder that includes the compiled EA to another location on your drive, and then run your "original" terminal, click on expert properties and set the settings as listen in the attached picture.  
  
2\. from expert properties check the variables to be optimized with their intervals and save the file in name QQE.set in your original terminal folder  
  
3\. do the pre-optimization once and calculate the time needed for optimization to enter it in the settings.  
  
for further information see <http://articles.mql4.com/506>  
  
fixed:  
  
1\. at least one type of lot size types must be chosen  
2\. if money management is true then ignore manual lot size.  
3\. the last peark/bottom price-bar and last peak/bottom of indicator can be different (in case there was a divergence in the last peak, specially when using long periods)  
  
this is all i can think of, due to depending on lagging indicator, it just keeps failing in traps or false spikes, so "in case" there's a further development it will be on volume and spread.  
  
comment: automated optimization will not function while using pre-optimization (normal optimization) or while backtesting, it will only function when using it live on real or demo account. hence the attached picture represents the results without automated-optimization.

Happy new year bro ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
  
For now yes, since the daily QQE has crossed upwards and we have a daily candle close above daily gann, so I've started buying dips, ive got longs on from 135.90 area, taregting 140s with stops in 134s 

Trade what you see, not what you think.

Thanks again Karmo for your Posts... They are extremly helpful. Got in my Long at 133.40, and my Target price is 139.15, and I plan to get back in going Long on a Dip, after I capture those inital pips.  
  
I also Plan to be done trading before the Non-Farm News Comes out. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

I'm back from London..  
  
so let's get back to trading ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
I'm waiting for Frankfurt/London markets to open before I start opening trades  
  
Price is below 1h/4h gann so those TFs are bearish, but price is still above Daily gann (133.80)  
  
Patience ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/270c-fe0f.png?v=15.1)

Looking like a nice double bottom. I am long with 129.53 as the stop, if it breaks its yesterday low, then I guess it is not finished exploring the basement.

Today is important, we must see whether price will get above the daily gann or below 4h gann.

4hr gan already above and candle below it.. QQe 4hr haven't cross doted line and still above 50 line... 1hr QQe cross below 50 line but daily gan still holding to downside as well as QQe.  
  
So Karmo is this means we still in bearish? until daily gan turn to north than only can consider bullish trend start ?

Yes, the trend is bearish to me until the daily QQE crosses upwards and we get a daily candle close above daily gann hilo.

Hi Karmo seems like GJ will go down further if broke weekly fibo at 124.xx and may go to new low again. Please correct me if I'm wrong.. I'm still learning. Thanks.

hi traders,  
  
I'm going to go through the thread from start to finish to better understand karmo's QQE trading approach... but before I do can any of you "regular" readers/followers let me know if their have been changes made to the system that have yet to be updated on the first page??  
  
ie: sometimes you get half way through and suddenly things you have been reading and trying out have been drastically altered... leading back to square one  
  
Looking forward to this for sure ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
many thanks

Hello there,  
  
Nothing has been changed, I use the same system and if there is any questions or doubts on your mind, just post here and I'll explain it to you.

Since last night 1h QQE crossed up and price bounced off 119.xx but it has not been able to get above 1h 50ema, so this is not a true bullish signal. Price was also not able to close above 4h gann but 4h QQE crossed upwards, this is a bearish continuation pattern and we could see a retest of the low and even new low's **as long as we remain below 4h gann.**  
  
Use good Money Management and a stop-loss.

Price needs to close above 129 (daily gann) on the daily for me to target daily 50ema, otherwise if 4h QQE crosses downwards then GJ is headed back down to the low's.

note sure if there is a way to off set the qqe signal line so that it gives trades earlier or zoom down into a lower time frame , but i think you need ot have qqe signal line cross under qqe ( much like I use a sma on my rsx indicator)  
  
one comment on the fib retarcements .. make sure you plot them to exact tops and bottoms otherwise you will be out. The one you drew is slightly off

Hi newkidfx. The retrace fibs should have been drawn from bottom to top, instead of top to bottom. A good rule of thumb to remember while you're learning, is to _always draw them from left to right_. Then you don't have to figure out each time whether you should start from the bottom or top. You just follow the rule and it will turn out right. Eventually the top / bottom will start making more sense and you won't have any problem with it.  
  
If price had broken below the 50ema and the lower trend line, I would have opened a short trade for a 50% retrace to the 124 area. The 61.8% fib around 123 would have also been a possibility. Now that it's broken the upper trend line instead, and price is back above the Gann, I will be looking for a continuation north. But there's a good chance we'll have an Asian retrace first, maybe to about 128. The 4H 200ema around 132 is an area of resistance above, and it looks like a good target for Monday's London or NY sessions if the tide doesn't change in the meantime. I wouldn't be surprised to see 134 - 136 sometime this week. But I'll be taking it one day at a time since the larger trend is still bearish, and things could change quickly.  
  
Keep up the good work!

hi karmo,  
  
i think, right now, chart pattern on cable looks little more clearer than geppy.  
i see possible shampoo forming on cable. if the neckline breaks then it sure will take geppy at least to the 120 area. IMHO.  
  
hi cruiser. good to see you.

GJ is not normal this week, not respecting anything. I've been burnt a bit since Thurs, I guess this kind of PA happens once in a while, it's best to stay out of this crap..  
  
As long as 129 is not broken, no longs for me.

As long as we stay above 4h gann (134), it should be good but if we get below 4h gann then we could see a bit more down, say to 4h 50ema and lower TL of the 4h bullish channel around 131.  
  
I would go short if the 4h bullish channel breaks and we get below daily gann hilo. 

Trade what you see, not what you think.

Price bounced off 4h gann hilo, now if 1h QQE crosses up and we get a 1h candle close above 1h gann, then we could see high 137s/138 by the end of the day.

Lines up with my analysis i've posted at my thread. Price bounced from ascending channels ML (median line) and it might be looking for its upper border 137.30-50 on my chart. Pretty the same view Karmo =)

4h candle has closed below 4h gann hilo on IBFX, that's a bearish sign.  
1h candle has closed below 1h 50ema for first time since the uptrend from 129.  
  
GJ seems to have turned bearish for now, target for shorts is 4h 50ema which is around 132.

Plus we are in a nice 4h upward channel, 4h 50ema coincides with the LTL of this channel.

135 if acts as resistence ?   
  
thanks

yah 4h 5sma is a good entry, with stop just above 4h gann

Price remains below 4h gann and 1h gann, bearish.  
  
We have to wait and see if todays candle closes below daily gann (129), if yes then we could see some real tanking..  
  
btw price is back below daily 50ema as well.

karmo, do you look for retracement in a bearish setting (according to your rules)? or do you hold as long PA continues to be bearish below ur rules (ie below gann, crossing etc).

I do look at 15m for retracements or rallies to sell into when 4h/daily trend is down and vice versa when the trend is bullish.

what is worrying me is, we havent seen any retracement.. we are limited with 5min ema, and that is nothing. I was hoping we are going to touch and bounce from Daily gann in early london, so we can revisit and broke in NY.. now.. I can t say short until we retrace a bit 382 500 618 or the best is if we can test 50 ema [1h]. After that the shorts are SAFE  
  
me think !   
cheers, and get well

I'll give you an example, it might help you understand how I pick my entries.  
  
Let's say 4h just turned bearish and we got below 4h gann with QQE crossing down. I'll wait for 15m QQE to cross up (usually during asia session) and wait for 15m to turn back bearish, that's when I'll make my entry. 

Trade what you see, not what you think.

i see. that's pretty cool. so your thinking is that once PA turns bearish, it doesn't immediately tank but will go further up and then drop?  
  
so when H1/H4 TF are bearish (below gann, QQE cross down), u do not make a trade?  
  
when u say crossing and bearish, are they synonymous, or do you look for crossing of the 50 line to confirm?

Price always retraces to 5sma, on any TF and that can be used for entry, especially on 1h/4h/daily.  
  
When I say crossing, I mean QQE crossing the dotted line downwards/upwards. 

Trade what you see, not what you think.

Price is below Daily, 4H, and 1H 50ema and is currently trading below 4H gann hilo.  
  
Price could also close below Daily gann hilo today/tomorrow, we'll have to wait and see.

your throat & chest infection, most probably are related to your latest trip or even the previous London trip. try to avoid taking medications, recuperate via fruits & veggies if possible. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Hi Karmo,  
This is my first post at FF.   
  
Take a look at this chart. It has a gann 240/10 (TF/Period) and 1440/10 imposed on the chart with the extremes prices outside of the bolinger bands. The bars are colored based on multiple time frame qqe 240/5-240/10.  
  
I am not sure if this would help establish a higher probability entry.  
  
Of particular interest are the white and yellow bar combinations. They suggest reversal and/or consolidation.   
Reds and Blues hues are obvious.   
  
The second chart is esentially the 4H chart with the period changed to 1H. Gann does not change. All other indicators change with the change on chart period.  
  
Your input in the above pursuit would be invaluable.v  
  
I do not want to clutter this thread with indicators unless warranted.  
  
Thanks   
  
Pat  
  
PS Belated b'day good wishes to you.

forexlion,  
thanks, i'm aware of the mql4 website. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
what i was after were the indicators in Pat1's charts. they seem a little unusual. I'd like to check them out & see if i can learn something new from those indicators (syntax, etc.)

Last week we got a 4h QQE cross down and a candle close below 4h gann but the candle right after it closed right back above 4h gann again, price is also still above 4h 50ema, so the signs are bullish and indicate bullish continuation.  
  
As long as price remains above 4h gann, 4h 50ema, and Daily 50ema, then I'll target 137 first and if broken then 141 area.  
  
I'll think of shorts only if we get below 4h 50ema, Daily 50ema, and Daily gann hilo.

As expected, 137 has been hit and 4h QQE is crossed upwards but need to wait another 2h30m just to confirm it.  
  
141 could be the next target if price remains above 137.

15m QQE has crossed down earlier but price has been ranging between 138 and 139, this is a good indication of bullish continuation as long as price remains above 1h gann hilo.

I look at 15m for entry and SL is usually 100 pips, risking 1%

137 acted as support, GJ could be heading to 141 in the coming sessions if it can remain above 137.

I tighten the SL until it hits or if I get lucky, it'll reverse to my favor again.

We have a nice bull flag on GJ 15m chart, wait for a breakout, most likely to the upside.

Hi all .. I've been a lurker lately as I've been travelling a lot and waiting to close on my daughter's new home in Houston (where I am now).   
Also, I feel your pain, karmo, I've been sick off & on for weeks with some wierd cough-cold-throat thing. I treat it holistically so no doctors, but with all the travelling it has been hard to get on top of it. I'm going to an acupuncturist tomorrow & hopefully he can 'needle' the last remnants out of me LOL.  
  
I've been trading casually in demo account following the good analysis in here and doing very well .. I plan to start trading live acct again when I am finally re-settled, starting next week.

The upper TL has been broken by 1h candle, it looks like 141 is on the way.

There was no follow through after the breakout, so price has been wondering around the same area for hours. I'm going to be keep an eye on 1h and 4h gann Today/Tomorrow, especially the 4h QQE n Gann hilo.  
  
We might have a nice short setup coming up.

Price has been bouncing around the fib levels, plus we have a bear flag in the process, I think we should continue downwards once the retracement is over, but it's being stubborn for now and I could be wrong.

What level would you add to shorts now.   
What about SMA(5) 1h.   
Thank you

hmm, 4h bull flag? 4h QQE crossed down since last week and ready to cross back up, price is still above 4h 50ema. I'll need to see it below 4h 50ema for more bearishness otherwise if price manages to get back above 4h gann and 4h QQE crosses upwards, then expect high 140s to 150

Daily QQE crossed downwards and a Daily candle closed below Daily gann hilo, strong bearish signal.

Price remains to be below 1h 50ema, which indicates that the current trend is down ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Hi Karmo,  
  
good luck recovering!  
  
If you find time, could you shortly maybe share some ideas where it went "wrong" with your trading?  
  
Lost of focus / mindset  
just the new market conditions  
previous system mechanism dont work anymore  
etc  
  
hope to learn something of this.  
  
Thanks in advance and again: best of luck!

GodfreyH modfied an indicator to to show QQE for different timeframes, i've taken that indicator one step further so now it shows if price is above/below Gann HiLo, and it works as follows, if QQE is crossed upward and price closed above gann, a green shadow will appear (look at the chart), if its crossed downward and price closed below gann, a red shadow will appear BUT if qqe is to the upward and price is below gann then no color will appear (that would be optional, you can change that and set a color, in fact you can change any color you want)  
  
comments:  
  
1- make sure you have Gann HiLo indicator and named as ###Gann_HiLo_Activator_v2###  
  
2- make sure you have QQE indicator and named as QQEA

yet, the indicator buffering system is sooo dumb, and object creation needs some improvment, but yes, almost everything is possible ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Right where im taking profit on my third and last long position. Reverse from there looks tempting with a tight stop.

Price is below 4h gann but still above 4h 50ema, so the bear is not in full control, if price manages to get back above 4h gann and 4h QQE crosses back up, then the next target is 153+

Price is currently above 4h gann but we need a 4h candle close above the gann and GJ shall be on it's way to 155 area.

Hello gurugs,  
  
The charting software is MetaTrader (MT4), you'll need to download the QQE n Gann files and paste them in the MT4/Experts/Indicator folder

gurugs,  
if i may...  
MT4 is free. several brokers offer it for a demo account. U can try it & download from these:  
[http://www.ibfx.com](http://www.ibfx.com/)  
[http://www.alpari-idc.com](http://www.alpari-idc.com/)  
[http://www.alpari-us.com](http://www.alpari-us.com/)  
  
or look [here](http://www.forexfactory.com/brokers.php) to find a broker that offers MT4.  
  
& the indicators u are looking for are not in .exe formats. Find them in this thread's attachments (look for "289" with a PIN beside it **above** , right beside where u click on the pages--- at the row **above** where u see "Post Reply" & the pages)  
or alternatively, u can search for it within FF.  
  
  
Answers to your questions are just around you(& have been answered many many times), if u would just **exert a little more effort & read a little more**.  
U have been a member of FF for quite awhile. Take full advantage of it. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Hey sony,  
  
I'm good, yourself?  
  
The 4h QQE was crossed when the 4h candle closed but I see now it is slightly uncrossed because of the small retracement we're seeing, your settings are fine. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Or any other?

mostly 100 pips, and sometimes 200 but dividing position in half.

Hello Karmo.  
  
Just a quick question for you. In Auslanco's original system he is using the LevelStop-Reverse for trade confirmation and for stop losses. I don't see it on your charts anywhere. Are you still using it or have you discarded it? If you are still using it, is the ATRperiod still 28 and ATRmultiplier 2.75 or has that changed ?  
  
Thanks

yes, a fresh entry would be once 15m QQE turns bullish, price bounced off 4h gann again.. there is still chance for the bull.

Hey Pahadi,  
  
I don't use the levelstop reverse anymore, sorry.

That didn't work out, anyways let's move on... price is below 4h gann and bouncing off daily gann hilo, today's daily close is very important.

Hi karmo,  
  
4H price jus bounced off 4H 50 Ema, and closed above 4HGann Hilo  
1H price closed above Gann Hilo at 9Gmt, crossed 50 line.  
is that a good set up for price to break 149.30?  
  
How would your analysis be?

I was looking at the same setup but didn't work out well, price action is just crazy this week and GJ continues to range which sucks for this system unless you look at 5m/15m charts.  
  
The range is 145.70 - 149.30 

Trade what you see, not what you think.

Yes, that's what I found out too. It's crazy this week. for the last few 4H candles, it drop like crazy from top to bottom range. If you all might realise, there's a down trend from 15M chart. I expect it will go down to 145.80 if the next 4H candle closed below 4H 50EMA. Hope i'm correct

From 118.80 to 151.50 , we have now met the resistance around 148 area, the btm of financial crisis back to 1998. So for the next 2 weeks, we might have ranging until monthly candle closed.  
  
If closed above 148, like what we see, price may rose up to weekly .382 fibo.  
If closed below 148, we might go back test 118 as the past 3 months with bullish candles mgith be just some retracement of downtrend PA..  
  
Can I have your opinion, karmo? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

I've been asked several times to post QQE trend map indicator so im posting it here since this thread contains followers mainly use qqe and gann, but make sure you write the pair name in capital letter.  
  
trend map.tpl goes into the template folder, the rest goes into the indicators folder

Hi Karmo,  
  
I have been trying to keep up with all the posts on your thread and have not been able to do so.  
  
As all traders are trying to find that one that works best for them, I have noticed how highly everyone speaks of your expertise and system.  
  
I see that you also live in Dubai and was wondering if we could meet for a coffee and discuss your strategy.

I'm going to explain the strategy I use to trade GJ and I'm going to be posting my weekly/daily analysis of this pair.  
  
I don't use anything fancy, I use some basic stuff that most traders use and some common sense ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
  
The indicators I use are: 

  1. Fibonacci retracement levels
  2. Trendlines/Channels
  3. 5 period simple MA
  4. Candlestick patterns
  5. Support/Resistance levels
  6. Momentum

As you can see it's all simple and basic stuff except maybe for the fibonacci retracement, because every trader could use it differently....

Hi everyone ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
It's been a while since I posted anything on here, I've been trading very very little the past several months, I've been busy with other things in life. I hope everyone is doing well and trading profitably ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Let me post what I see on my chart and indicators..  
  
4h looks bullish, candle is going to close in 20 mins, QQE is crossing upwards and price is nicely above 4h gann, if it stays this way, I'd consider a long position and target 100-200 pips or set sl to +1 after its up 50 or 70 pips and let it run.

4h QQE has crossed up, best enrty would be at 4h 5sma which is around 155.30

If price stays above 4h gann, and 1h QQE turns upwards and price gets above 1h gann, GJ could go to 159-160 which is the next resistance area on my chart.  
  
Go short only if 4h QQE crosses downwards and we get a 4h candle close below 4h gann.  
  
Good luck ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/270c-fe0f.png?v=15.1)

Hello KARMO.... Man, its so good to see you... To Say You've Been missed, would truly be an understatement & it would not truly, do it justice.  
  
I am Soooooo Glad you're Back my Friend.  
  
I agree with you in regards to GJ. I've also, been buying on the Dips, and usually entering in on a 5 min Time Frame. Karmo, as Long as the price remains above the 50 ema and the Gann, I am only looking to go Long for now.  
  
However, **_once this Baby turns and change direction_** ,_**I am on it.**_ Karmo, as we have discussed before... I just really love it, when we short this Beast.   
  
The Bulk of my Account was Builded, based mainly from Shorting this beast....Things fall faster than they Assend, so my Brokerish Account has grown exponentially as a result of the Huge falls this beast makes...   
  
However, until we get a change of direction, my game plan will be buying the dips, until the trend Changes on 4 hr chart.  
  
Happy Trading my Friend. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Hi Karmo & All Good trader,  
  
IMO for this week GJ will touch 160.xx - 162.xx area due to 4hr/daily/weekly and monthly price above gan and QQe cross up very bullish. My target for this week 160.27 1st traget and 162.62 2nd target let see how it goes.  
  
Best regards.

Greetings All Good Trader!  
  
As for yesterday price hit my 1st target and I'm still holding bulls for my 2nd target 162.xx and already set my sl +200.   
  
IMO With current PA right now anything might happen unless 1hr QQe cross below 50 line I will start selling for safety reason![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1) Me also scared with current PA![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f923.png?v=15.1)  
  
Meantime have patience and trust your chart.  
  
Best of luck!![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Hey Karmo,  
  
Good to see you again.  
  
Agreed on above statement. IMO, 50% fib level (167.37 on my chart) might be reached. 

Do not follow my trades. Trade what you see on your own charts.

Hello Karmo, I must agree with you.. the GANN indicator has been so reliable and my account has grown exponentially as a result of it.  
  
I've been entering off a 5 min chart, and capturing pips along the way, and the Gann indicator has given my entry & exit signals... However, the larger Time Frames (4hr /Day chart) give me my over-all Trend.  
  
I am sooo Glad your back in action Karmo. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

IMHO for tf 1hr and 4hr target base on my chart i,m looking forward price might touch to 158.03 area ( 61.8 black fibos on 4hr ). If price want to retrace will be at at 4hr 5sma before go down again to 158.xx area. I'f i'm wrong I hit myself with my notebook![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f923.png?v=15.1)

Might a good entry be a 1h qqe cross up to go long?

Yup, that would be a good entry.

I'm still holding my short from 159.30 hope can reach TP5. My TP1 and TP2 already hit yesterday. As long tf4hr / daily price below ganhilo I'm bear bias, if trend go opposite way I already set my profit +sl. Anything can happen in forex.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Hope we all profit again today. Good luck.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Hello Karmo, I just open up a live account & its funded with only 9K. I have read in the past what you wrote regarding proper money management.  
  
I know you where once like me, starting out for the first time in the forex market. I wanted to ask you... With a small account, ($9,000) such as mines, what would be the maximum amount of mini lots you would begin trading? What's your advice for me?  
  
Also, how large the account should be, before I can start trading Standard lots?  
  
I know I should only risk 2% of the account... But I really would like your Advice regarding the maximum amount of lots.   
  
Thanks in Advance.  
  
Tony1

Hi Tony1,  
  
I would advise you to trade 1 mini lot, if you win the trade with lets say 100 pips, then increase to 2 lots, if you win that too, then 4 mini lots, and if you win again then double it again and stay at 8 mini lots or you can increase to 1 standard lot, if you lose at any point, go back to 1 mini lot.  
  
This way you risk little ($100) but if you get on a nice winning streak, you could get a nice reward.  
  
Please do not start by risking 5%-10% or more because you will lose your account quickly if you lose just a couple of trades in a row. 

Trade what you see, not what you think.

Hey newkidfx,  
  
I'm good thanks, yourself?  
  
GJ has bounced off weekly gann, 4h QQE n gann just turned bullish, so I think we could be heading up a bit and if daily crosses, then more bullishness to come..

Thanks Karmo, I appreciate the Advise, I only plan to risk 2% ...It's great to have a Seasoned Trader, who have already walked on this path, I am about to walk. You stated $100 would be all I risk at one time.  
  
**_Question:_** If I am going for only 50 pips per trade Target at a time.. Would that be 2 mini lots at a time? (since 50X2 = 100) or would that still be 1 mini lot?  
  
Thanks again for your assistance in this matter. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

thanks for the strategy Karmo,I have stayed away from cable yen because of the high spread.I know the pair really moves but I am new and   
still have a little fear.I just downloaded a demo from FXCH out of London and they have a 1 pip spread for all pairs and that includes gbp/jpy.from all the research I have done their [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") are the best.I don't know anything about them except they are ecn.I hope this can help you or anyone else.I am new to forex but not to the world.

Hello Trader Vick... in regards to FXCH, is good you have a demo account with them, but by all means DO NOT OPEN A LIVE ACCOUNT.. you can read about all the warnings from traders here..

Nice to see you back Karmo ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) I've joined a group that is trading mainly GY and EY using renko bars .. just going for small pips at a time, but they accumulate.  
I also watch the GY for longer term swing trades and I think a strong bullish run may begin soon. So I am glad you are sharing your wisdom with us.

Weekly QQE has turned bearish with Weekly candle closing below Gann.  
Daily QQE and Gann are bearish as well.  
Price is currently retracing, if price remains below 4h gann then I see a high possibility of going to 135..

Hi Karmo,  
I have been using the Gann hi lo and QQE combo to trade for a while now. Basically once the price crosses Gan i take the trade at the close of that bar.(4 hr charts).   
I would appreciate it if you explain how you incorporate the momentum in your system.  
Thanks in advance.  
Jad

for a while, I thought its forming a continuation pattern.  
I just got stopped on my short for 12+  
looking at the weekly chart it seems unable to Close above gann, so I'll be looking for another short.

Do you think we will get a nice Reversal to the upside, from 148.60 & then continue to move lower?

Since the fall from 148 to 139, GJ has done a 50% retracement. Plus GJ looks to be like in a big bear flag (1h/4h).. hmm it could have a try at 61.8% before resuming downwards.. best is to wait for the flag to break rather than jumping in early.

I think I'll long it for a little bet if 4hr closes above 1.44

It looks like that was the last swing high on the 1 and 4 hour, but I am not sure either why he picked that one. It looks like she is breaking upward from the bear flag so if fib is drawn back to the 153 high, then she could reach the 61.8 retracement of that, which is also just above Weekly R1 level?

Looks like gj is falling to the same lows of last year, and that the up trend that started this year is nothing but a retracement. but it has to break 139.00 first.

I agree old friend, it has been indeed challenging trading this beast. That's for sure, but I have not given up.

Waiting for a breakout of 130.60 or 129.00, until then I'll just watch this crazy price action.

hi karmo.. just stopping by to share my idea about this beast .. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
  
i can see that lower TF 15mn, 30mn.. suggest that this beast is channeling up.. but too much volatility right now.. waiting is the best policy for those who have no entries yet...

Price bounced off Daily 50ema as expected, currently price is below 4h gann but above daily gann, and wondering around the LT of the upward channel we have, we have to see what happens next week, if it breaks the LT and gets below daily gann then expect to see lower prices.

Price might retest the broken the channel and retrace 38.2% (133.04), plus weekly pivot is at 133.10 and bounce back down from there and continue..  
  
Price is below 4h Gann, if price bounces back down then we could close below daily gann today and that would be **very** bearish for GJ.

If GJ closes below daily gann hilo (131) and Daily QQE crosses down, then we will see GJ tank hard.  
  
Let's see where GJ candle closes today. 

Trade what you see, not what you think.

He's back!! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)  
  
I'm mostly trading cable now but I watch UJ and all 3 yen crosses .. if all are going in the same direction AND cable is too, then I will grab a ride on the beast .. and this strategy seems to be working fairly well with minimal pain.   
So I wasn't using Gann/QQE so much as watching agreement in direction among the yen crosses. Trades were few & far between.  
  
However now that the Master is back, I look forward to learning from his stellar analysis. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

GJ needs to break the trendline, 131 level and a daily close below daily gann hilo for us to see a nice tanking ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

If the trendline breaks, I'll go short  
If 132.50 breaks to upside, then I'll go long  
  
so let's see

4h H&S  
  
also break of uptrend channel would be bearish for GJ.   
  
confirmation when price moving below 131 for a longer time short.

I've had a very patient long on GY for about 2 weeks now, just waiting in the weeds as sooner or later it should pay. Stop is deep & position small but can always add once direction is confirmed. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

yup. after this kind of action usually a huge moves comes. so patience will be key. but i still have a bearish bias until bulls take out 135.   
  
so longer she stays in this ugly range. bigger the move coming ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

I decided to close the long on that last attempt up to 135 which failed. The GU has been in no man's land forever .. and GY can't really do much without confirmation from GU. Bias for GU next week is either up ... or down(!) Sentiment running about 50-50 on the GU thread. Both GU and GY will probably do a fake move in one direction before a decisive move in the other .. but which will come first?? Below 132 I will buy again as I do not see this pair getting much below 129 before a massive up move.  
I've been wrong before. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

>  If you look closely, you can see how the price went to the next daily fibo level after it broke and closed well below a level. we had a full retracement on the daily chart this past week. The last candle we have on the daily is a hammer/pin-bar/doji, whatever you want to call it.., price tried to break the weekly fibo's but it failed and it closed just above the 50%. To me this indicates that price will go up to the 231-232 area to test the fibonacci levels we have there.. we'll know next week ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

It's been a while, hello ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
GJ is bouncing off that trendline and it has made a 50-61.8% fibo retracement, I'm expecting an upward movement but will wait for confirmation (to trade above 4h gann hilo & 4h 50ema)

Well, hello, karmo! Big fan of your posts, bud! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f647-200d-2642-fe0f.png?v=15.1)  
  
Looks like the beast broke completely, just about to the 100 retracement levels, since your last post.   
  
I have my charts up looking like a fake to @ 124.08 level, then, back down as the daily and weekly still are bearing down.   
  
Tough place to be now. Wait it out for some confirmations.... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Continuing with the 1 hour G/Y chart.  
  
Well, from previous post, it tried to get to 124.08 but was summarily rejected.

Will possibly a slight bounce as H4 is NOW in accord with QQE and I don't usually have fuzzy feelings with H4 same as H1 and Daily.   
See what it does in the next 8 to 10 hours... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f924.png?v=15.1)

Interesting on the 4H TF how QQE reflects the deflection at the 50 level.   
  
Also, thought of note, the DELAYED reaction of this indicator. Keeping all Indicators and TF in mind... Not just 1.

And there is the bounce I was looking for. On the QQE, heading toward the 50 on the cross and blowing past my target.

GJ is trading above 4h gann and 4h 50ema, it is flirting with daily gann, if we can get a close above daily gann and 50ema and daily QQE crossing upwards, that would be a strong bullish sign, so stay patient and don't miss the opportunity ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

Didn't get to Bull up, though the close above the 4 hour GANN and above the 50 occurred. Not a fun ride. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f608.png?v=15.1)  
  
Now, daily QQE and GANN still looks bearish...

And continue down to @ 121.0X and bounce. Negative on the Wkly, Daily, 4 hour, though the 1 hour seems to be ready to bounce without much steam. Possibly to 122.2x, meet resistance and down to 120.

Price has been sitting on the LT of the channel, is it gonna bounce or break?  
Plus we have a bullish harmonic pattern on 4h/daily chart

GJ continues to make love with the lower TL of the channel, it's getting pretty boring...

And now, after a boring late night, this morning the beast stirs from its slumber and rears its head skyward...   
  
Sorry, been a bit without sleep... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
G/Y H4 - Above GANN and crossed above QQE 50 and looking like it's holding steady... Daily still not crossed above the GANN. Respecting the top of a downward channel from Daily/H4 chart.

Daily QQE crossed upwards and daily candle has closed above the gann hilo, but not above 50ema yet.  
  
4H QQE has crossed back downwards and a candle has closed below 4h gann hilo, but still above 50ema.  
  
I believe 4h is getting out of overbought area and the bullish move shall continue tomorrow, but it would be best to wait for confirmation before jumping in.  
  
Price also retreated today to daily 5sma.

Weekly Pivot of 122.665 seems to be anchoring the price... @ the Daily 5 SMA.  
  
Looking out for that Daily QQE 50 cross threshold for some Bullish fun. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1) Right on, Karmo!   
  
Stand by mode on GBPJPY interday/week trade.   
  
Spinning top had low volume, per my better Volume 1.4 indi. May just touch the Daily Gann of @ 122.04X and continue back to a Bullish posture. Need to continue to monitor that the H1/H4 QQE and GANN are still in the correct bullish positions if that happens. We had a similar situation happen a couple of times these last 2 months on the Daily chart that the price was below the GANN and 5 SMA then came back to a bullish posture.   
I'm also looking for it to close above the 50 EMA, which is the orange line on my chart. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

If we get a close above 4h gann hilo and daily 50ema, I would target the daily 50% fibo first and 61.8% fibo next

On the daily chart, price seems to be stuck in a triangle and bouncing up n down. Price is above daily gann and daily QQE is crossed upwards. The momentum is bullish IMO, but the 123.20 area has been tough resistance, if that level is broken then we have 123.75, and then another trendline at 124.75, there are several tough resistances but if they are broken, I expect to see atleast 126.80 and even possibly 129  
But, if the lower TL breaks then look down below.

My long-term view on GBP/JPY:  
If 139 holds, then back to the top.  
If 139 breaks, then 133.  
Where do the big boys want it to go?
