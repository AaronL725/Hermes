Hi,  
  
This EA is based on my "**Trade the Slope System** " and my Multi EMA system.  
link to TTS System <http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=52355>  
  
**_{see post 244 to download the EA}_**  
**_{sell only ea see post #311}_**  
  
THIS EA IS ONLY FOR EUR/USD. IT MIGHT WORK WITH OTHER PAIRS, BUT BOTH VARIABLES AND SETTINGS ARE OPTIMIZED FOR ONLY EUR/USD  
  
Setting for the EA (Only 15 Min or higher)   
  
Chart Eur/USD   
SL - False  
TS - 18  
TP - 30  
  
* I did not manuplated the historical data in in my video. You can use these settings from 2001-08-01 to 2008-03-16, to get the same results.  
Why these dates. I'll explain later.  
  
This is BETA V2.0. In my video i think i was running V4.5.  
]  
  
New test video (if the video is not clear play in few min. Read more info on my youtube channel)  

Inserted Video

Hi EMATRADER, you might need to post the EA in order to have some programmer put his hands on it to make the modifications you need, thanks for sharing, looks like it might be the best EA

Here's my try for your code request, looks kind of simple really, is this what you're looking for? Your EA looking very promising, hope we can try it out soon! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  

Inserted Code
    
    
    extern bool UseLotIncrement = true;
    extern double StartingSize  = 1.0;
    extern double EndingSize    = 10.0;
    extern double Lots            = 1.0;
    
    int init()
    {
       Lots = StartingSize;
    }

Put this at one line before your OrderSend:   
  

Inserted Code
    
    
    if (UseLotIncrement == true)
    {
       Lots = Lots + 0.1;
       if (Lots > EndingSize) Lots = EndingSize;
    }

Then just use the global variable Lots in your ordersends, such as:  
  

Inserted Code
    
    
    OrderSend(Symbol(),OP_BUY,Lots,Ask,Slippage,0,0,Comment,MAGIC,0,Green);

Correct me if I'm wrong, but are we looking at 1-pip TPs at $10/pip?   
Is this even doable on a live account feed?

EMATrader,  
  
Do you intend to share this EA or not? It would be helpful to know your intentions so I know whether to keep monitoring your thread.  
  
It's like the guy winning the lottery coming up to you and saying "hey look at me" every single week.  
  
We can all see it's successful.  
  
Please let us all know.  
  
Thanks,

Hi EmaTrader. Looks interesting. Is it your intention to provide the EA for others to test also, or are you just looking for programming assistance? Understand if you are planning to keep it to yourself, however it is a little confusing with your YouTube video calling it a Free Forex EA.  
  
As stated by someone else earlier, it would be good to know your intentions.  
  
Thanks.

I'm not planning to sell this EA. Anyone will be able to download this EA once it is completed. Though, it will be a protected copy; either dll or just protected ex4 file.  
I want to protect the system and prevent anyone making illigal copies and selling it online.  
(I'll make more money by trading this system rather than selling it![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Regards,  
EMATRADER

Hi ematrader, I can't seem to open my PM inbox, appears that my junior member status prevents it! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1)   
  
Alternatively you can email me at: x#b*t@hotmail.com

That's the real test of someone with a successful EA! When you can say I will make more from trading it than selling it.

I have been running "Buy Only" and "Sell Only" EA on live account with very good results. I lost only one trade in appox. 5 months. However, i have been trading this system manually since more than 2 years. This system works perfectly without any complex indicators, calculations etc.  
Though, i had to stay in front my pc most of the day.

**I observe your EA with great enthusiasm, it’s very impressive. If you want to develope this EA, the only mode it’s to test and test it again. How could be test it if you don’t share it? I think you need some help from a professional programmers. Just check in this forum and you’ll find them.**

I always trade from STD account. I never had Mini,Micro,Nano accounts... thats a waste of time for me. 10pip on std account is 100$.   
  
No SL in my system only TS.  
  
Photoshop? uhnnnn! I think u didn't watch the videos yet.  
  
Hope this helps.

issues resolved  
lot increments   
  
Issues still not resolved (Lets go one by one)  
  
EA opens one trade at a time only.  
What i want is...  
If one long trade is open  
EA should keep opening trades (long and short) if new conditions are met according to the system regardless of number of long and short position are still open. (Thats how i trade this system manually)  
  
I'm using this code in my EA, but its not helping.   
extern int MaxTrades = 10;  
  
Its still open one trade at a time, and will not open another trade untill the open trade is closed. I'll miss many trade if i'm trading from bigger timeframe i'e: 1h and up.

Ouch!! Maybe you need to watch better...where there are 10$ profits I see only 1 pip moves...  
  
Am I missing something??  
  
It seems to me that you enter in every thread to destroy it..

and check all of the $100 profit traders  
  
That exact one just an example... All of those trades are screw up..  
  
Sell 1.00 1.50314 S/L 1.50245 T/P 1.50214  
  
  
You saying that 1.50245 higher than 1.50314?  
  
  
And another one just below that one

I'm Asking AGAIN:  
  
HOW come Stop Loss On the SHORT trade could be below SELL entry price itself???  
  
P.S  
  
Chris_B, Thanks, yes, those where 1 pip trades, sorry, 5 digits got me there, you right...  
  
Then why would EA set TP at 1 pip? It's all strange..

After going back and looking again....Everything looks right to me.  
  
I though that MT put a "T" inside the icon for your Buy/Sells if there was a trailing stop, however, it only has the "T" when that trade is still open.  
  
The history does not reflect a TS icon.  
  
Sry to jump to conclusions ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61e.png?v=15.1) and can't wait to see the progression.  
  
I did notice you said you raised your TP around news.  
  
Any type (news) in particular or just med-high impact?

And like stated before he raised to 10pip TP for news

The stop is trailed...it's absolutely normal...  
  
When the stop is trailed it moves...so it can move also below sell entry...

Some programmer are requesting for codes to help me solve some of the problems with my EA.  
  
As i said the EA will be only available to everyone on 01-01-10.  
Again, my EA will be 100% free. I want to do the modification myself, during this i will for sure a bit a programming as well.  
  
Here is the sample EA generated by an online tool.  
Any programer here. Can you please modify this EA so it can open more then one trade at a time.

I suppose the problem is in this part of the code:  
  
//Check position  
bool IsTrade = False;  
for (int i = 0; i < Total; i ++) {  
OrderSelect(i, SELECT_BY_POS, MODE_TRADES);  
if(OrderType() <= OP_SELL && OrderSymbol() == Symbol()) {  
IsTrade = True;  
if(OrderType() == OP_BUY) {  
//Close  
  
Here you are defining a control of the open positions... and:  
  
//Buy  
if (Order == SIGNAL_BUY && ((EachTickMode && !TickCheck) || (!EachTickMode && (Bars != BarCount)))) {  
if(!IsTrade) {  
//Check free margin  
if (AccountFreeMargin() < (1000 * Lots)) {  
Print("We have no money. Free Margin = ", AccountFreeMargin());  
return(0);  
  
The part in red is the control...it tells the EA to not open a new trade if a trade is still in progress..

I think Chris_B is right, I commented out the lines and if-else portions using IsTrades, see if it works now.

Worth looking into...seems you have got something going on ematrader.  
  
All the best in sorting it out, and superior of you to consider offering it.   
I will keep glued to progression and also go through your other thread.

hey ematrader.... you can add a condition that will allow for the user to select 1 trade or multiple trades ..... just in case someone prefers single trades.....  
  
  

Inserted Code
    
    
     
       //Buy
       if (Order == SIGNAL_BUY && ((EachTickMode && !TickCheck) || (!EachTickMode && (Bars != BarCount)))) {
          if(!IsTrade || MultipleOrders) {

  
you can see i added MultipleOrders to the if(!IsTrade) condition.... also add code below to inputs..... do same for sell side.....h  
  

Inserted Code
    
    
     
    extern bool MultipleOrders = true;

  
//--  
  
//--  
  

Inserted Code
    
    
     
      //Sell
       if (Order == SIGNAL_SELL && ((EachTickMode && !TickCheck) || (!EachTickMode && (Bars != BarCount)))) {
          if(!IsTrade || MultipleOrders) {

to trade and code, keep both simple... no call to impress....h

Along with all the others here, I'm very interested in watching your EA do its thing and take it for a testdrive. Anyway, I want to thank you in advance for your obvious hard work.  
  
I'm relatively new here and can't contribute anything to your programming questions, but this thread has inspired me to take a closer look at your manual "Trade The Slope" system, as mentioned in the first post. Taken a couple of small trades based on it, to see how it plays out.  
  
You stated that your EA is also based on a multi EMA system I would also like to take a look at. Is that system mentioned somewhere here on FF or hasn't that seen daylight (yet)?  
  
Anyway, I have this thread bookmarked and am eager to learn more...

I never posted my Multi EMA system. Instead i worked on EA.  
  
This EA is based on both systems.  
However, you can always trade manually from TTS.

Looking forward to your ea ematrader. Quite an impressive performance shown in your vids.  
  
If you have any more snags in the ea, just ask. I'm sure many of us here will do what little we can to help.  
  
Will also be spending some time on your TTS system thread.

Finally, we have someone who is not trying to sell his EA and scalping the individual trader. Finally, we have someone who may have a good trading system and he is not going to milk the market with $ 49.00 trading seminars. Finally, there is a breath of fresh air in this Forum. Thanks for the EA when it comes out. One more thing, is there audio on the videos on youtube.com. I could not hear a thing. I checked my sound card..Just wondering. Thanks for all the hard work in this thread. If i knew how to code, I sure would lend a hand. I told all of my buddies in our trading room about this thread. I hope this EA is better than that Idiot Steinitz robot that claims it is not a loser...Looking forward to more great posts on this thread. thanks again.

I'm using the code blew in my EA.  
  
* EA does not cap MaxTrades to 3, it keep opening trades.  
. MultipleOrders function is working fine  
  
* In addition to Maxtrade issue, can someone please advice me how to program this EA, such that when MultipleOrders is set to True EA only opens next trade in oppsite direction of the current trade.  
  
i.e: If current is long on eur/usd  
then Maxtrade value function open all short untill long is closed. and vise versa.  
  
Thanks in advance.  
  
  
extern bool MultipleOrders = True;  
extern int MaxTrades = 3;  
  
//Buy

//Sell

A quick & dirty solution is to add OrdersTotal() vs maxtrades check before initiating the trade:  
  

Inserted Code
    
    
     
    //Buy
    if (Order == SIGNAL_BUY && OrdersTotal() <= MaxTrades && ((EachTickMode && !TickCheck) || (!EachTickMode && (Bars != BarCount)))) {
    if( !IsTrade || MultipleOrders  ) {
    //Sell
    if (Order == SIGNAL_SELL && OrdersTotal() <= MaxTrades && ((EachTickMode && !TickCheck) || (!EachTickMode && (Bars != BarCount)))) {
    if( !IsTrade || MultipleOrders ) {

  
A more elegant solution would be to do a proper counting function to count only trades opened by this EA so it won't mess up your manual trades, or other EA trades:  
  

Inserted Code
    
    
     
    int CountTrades()
    {
     // Count current trades by this MAGIC
     int cpt, result = 0;
     for(cpt=0;cpt<OrdersTotal();cpt++)
     {
      OrderSelect(cpt,SELECT_BY_POS,MODE_TRADES);
      if ( OrderSymbol()==Symbol() && OrderMagicNumber()==MAGIC ) result++;
     }
     return(result);
    }
    extern bool MultipleOrders = True;
    extern int MaxTrades = 3;
    //Buy
    if (Order == SIGNAL_BUY && CountTrades() <= MaxTrades && ((EachTickMode && !TickCheck) || (!EachTickMode && (Bars != BarCount)))) {
    if(!IsTrade || MultipleOrders) {
    //Sell
    if (Order == SIGNAL_SELL && CountTrades() <= MaxTrades && ((EachTickMode && !TickCheck) || (!EachTickMode && (Bars != BarCount)))) {
    if(!IsTrade || MultipleOrders) {

Hi Ematrader,  
  
Thanks for sharing your EA/system. It looks very promising and I can't wait to try it out. You mentioned that the EA had one lost in 5 months. If I may ask, how many pips was this loss? I'm big on money management and I'm curious to know what risk/reward this EA has as well as recovery time after a loss.  
  
You also mentioned that there is no SL in the system, only TS and TP. Is there at least an emergency SL in case of PC/internet issues? Also, are you using hidden TS and TP?  
  
Thanks,  
Stimuls

Hi,  
Loss was 100 pips. About profit... lot lot more then the loss. I keep changing my TP and TS levels according to the current events ie. news. EA will recover a loss of 100 pip in less than 48h. absolute drawdown is between 7% and 10% depending on the setting.  
The EA does not have hidden TS and TP yet.

Thanks Ema,   
  
I was expecting a much larger loss so I'm impressed. How would you adjust the TS and TP when high impact news is near? Raise TP and tighten SL?  
  
Thanks,

Ematrader, Looks like you use your EA flexibly according to current events. Presuming you will be able to give us a few guidelines on what variations have worked for you when you release the EA on 1st Jan?  
  
Looking forward to giving this a test drive to see what it can do!

We have been told many times that this EA will be offered for FREE   
on 01/01/10 @ 12a.m.  
  
![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)  
  
Although, with this type of intrest, I can't help but wonder if it will go commercial 01/02/10 @ 12a.m.  
  
No offense to you Ematrader, you just have quite a few holding their breath!   
  
I do however look forward to the release if it does remain FREE!![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f64f.png?v=15.1)

Well he said himself he'd rather make money using it himself, which means it is a profitable EA otherwise he would be more inclined to sell it. I think a worse case is him not sharing it - it's not like he came here to just announce results and make a release date, he actually required some free help

I completely agree Sim!  
  
So far he has only exhibited traits of an honest one, and the help that he has required kinda rules out a marketing scheme, which usually would be in the final (if not complete) stages when debuting for the hook of noobs!  
  
Only time (like 19 days and 20something Hrs....ish) will tell if it (EA) and he (Ema) are what they claim!  
  
I'm hoping for it to be a GREAT NEW YEAR if I was to pick sides though.... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

From your example, it appears that your EA will be opening trades in groups or cycles?  
  
If I understand it correctly, for each "cycle" there will be only one parent trade (ie. SELL) that will repeatedly open child trades of the opposite type (BUYS) until MaxTrades limit is hit. Once that parent closes, the cycle begins again, regardless of whether any children are still open?  
  
Please refer to the code below if thats the case...  
  

Inserted Code
    
    
    extern bool MultipleOrders = True;
    extern int MaxTrades = 3;
    
    // When EA starts, init parent variables...
    // REMINDER: Whenever closing a parent trade, reset its ParentTicket to -1 and ParentType to "none".
    
    init()
    {
        ParentTicket = -1;
        ParentType = "none";
    }
     
    
    if (MultipleOrders == true)
    {
        // If MultipleOrders option is true, look for parent orders created by this EA....
    
        // - If no parent exists (ParentTicket variables are still in default values),
        //   begin new cycle by creating a new parent trade (buy or sell),
        //   and save its ticket to "ParentTicket" variable, and trade type to "ParentType" variable.
    
        // - Else, if parent exists, determine whether to create children? Their type will be opposite of parent...
    
    
        if ( ParentTicket == -1 && ParentType == "none" )
        {
            // buy
            ....
            ....
            ParentTicket = OrderSend(..........);
            ParentType   = "buy";
    
            // sell
            ....
            ....
            ParentTicket = OrderSend(..........);
            ParentType   = "sell";
        }
        else
        {
            // if MaxTrades not yet hit, create children....
            //        if Parent is a buy, create a sell Child
            //        if Parent is a sell, create a buy Child
    
            if ( CountTrades() <= MaxTrades )
            {
                if ( ParentType == "buy" )
                    // sell
    
                if ( ParentType == "sell" )
                    // buy
            }
        }
    
    }
    else
    {
        // MultipleOrders == false, do normal buy & sells
    
            // buy
    
            // sell
    }

Then the Indi should show up in your "Custom Indicators" tab inside MT4.

that's my opinion too,   
give ematrader a chance to prove if his intentions and words are honest,  
which I not doubt!

Hi ematrader - does the code attached to this from mcko do what you were looking for.  
Is there any particular rules for when to open the child/retracement trades.  
  
If not quite what you wanted, ask your questions again in a different way.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
I will have another look at your earlier posts to see if they would fit with this type system.

They stay only 16 days of attended end to “the great day.” I am really curious.

Ask Tim Hayder (if you don't know who it is, then you probably aren't ready to fully automate your account yet) and he'll tell you...more than 50 people using the EA will have all brokers looking for it and disrupting trades.  
  
I appreciate your willingness to help everyone, but in reality you will be hurting yourself.  
  
  
Just a thought.

I agree this is very true.  
  
I used a few EA's in the past and found myself receiving a telephone call from ODL saying that I was using "FAP Turbo" which I wasn't but a number of people were.  
  
They closed down my account.....  
  
Don't know how it would pan out on an ECN broker account with MB Trading but we'll have to wait and see. I don't even know if this EA will be compatible with a 2 stage broker.

That's a funny comment, to think that 50 people using the same EA on various brokerage feeds will disrupt trade liquidity.  
  
....  
  
3.3 Trillion dollar transactional market vs. 50 retail traders. Why would a broker bother?

Whilst 50 of us trading with the money we got from our piggy banks at home will not have any effect at all on liquidity, clearly ODL (which were high up in my book of best brokers) had an issue with a number of people using the same or similiar EA's....

Banks trade with trillions of dollars from thousands of clients. Let's say each of us have a $100,000.00 forex account. Do you think the banks will care? Besides if 50 people keep winning there will be at least 2 newbie traders for each of us losing thier money trading blindly. Forex is the highest liquidity market and there is absolutely nothing to worry about. FAPturbo is not illegal, I know several traders that use it and not a problem. They wouldn't allow Metatrader 4 platform if the e.a.'s were a potential harm to the forex market. Many forex brokers offer Automated trading from other service providers. Automated trading or no, there will always be winning and losing systems, but that doesn't worry anybody. Not even the US stock market worries about winning automated trading.   
  
And you are worried about Forex liquidity? LMAO![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f923.png?v=15.1)

You dim-wit's!  
  
Not BANK liquidity...your broker "real-time" liquidity.  
  
Of those who think this is so "silly"...how many of you have legit payed for an EA and used it longer than 5 months...

I would say that clearly ODL has a problem with any trader that wins more than he /she loses.   
They obviously are taking the other side of the trade AGAINST you.   
A broker should be there to facilitate your entry into the market, period.   
A broker that holds the other side of the trade has a vested interest in you losing.   
I do believe I would take my business elsewhere.

I agree. Only those who have a broker who trades against them will have a problem with this EA. If you do have a broker like that, change to one who just makes on the spread and swap.

I might try MB Trading....  
  
But they only offer USD accounts and I dont feel comfortable taking a long term bet on the USD. My base currency is GBP.  
  
Will have to have a long hard think about it.

I was referring to that too.  
  
What are the chances of all 50 users using the same broker? Unless EMA turns out to be a commercial seller, requesting an affiliate brokerage sign up, what are the odds?  
  
What are the odds there's enough of us, who actually USE the EA properly on OOTB settings to cause liquidity connections problems?   
  
It's a farcry, and not much of a problem to really be worrying about.

If I am not wrong, Tim's EA's trade exotics or low liquidity crosses? Theres a big difference between trading say.. eur/usd and trading eur/cad. A very very big difference. There may be a few EA hunting brokers out there *Cough* interbankfx *Cough* but trading a grid EA for example, is not harmful to a broker who nets or client hedges. The only brokers who will be effected are those who are trading 100% against all trades. Which given market conditions, is a good way to go bankrupt these days. Either way, an ECN wil fix your problems.

Hi Ematrader  
  
You posted a pretty amazing trade history a few weeks ago. I'm just wondering if you have continued to trade the EA in the past couple of weeks while you have been modifying it, and if so whether it has continued to show similar results?   
  
Thanks

Phoned ODL a few weeks ago they said they were completely ECN and took profit only from commission?

You can find the full info here... <http://www.jadeinvestments.com>  
  
Originally I opened a small $500 account just to check them out. You can not trade micro lot as they have no dealing desk. Smallest lot size is .1 standard lots. Margin for .1 lot on EURUSD is $80.  
  
So far my experience has been good. Even during news time you rarely see more and a pip or two change in spread and that usually very quick. On average their EURUSD spread is around .4 to .7 pips during regular hours. Commission is 50 cents on .1 lot.

ema, I have been working with mt4 for the past few months and realised that the tester is extremely unreliable because often the data is corrupt.  
  
I messed around with mql for a while, then finally realised the best way to have a solid system (for testing first, then trading), is to have another program monitor the price feed from mt4 (by creating a bridge), save the data into a database, then run tests on that data.  
  
These systems are not easy to design at all, need to take into account things like spikes (lasting for seconds) in the prices from your broker, If you are not a seasoned programmer, you will find great difficulty in coding it - espeically with Mql.  
  
  
Anyways, just thought I would comment because I'm using a similar system but the slopes are decided by the parabolic sar indicator.  
  
Best wishes, merry xmas and a happy new year.  
  
PS. I am also "certain" as I can be from the work i've done so far, to make a profitable expert advisor, you need to have some form of human input/part in the decision making, even if it is only to help the program understand whether the market is trending etc etc.

Says the guy with 39 posts.  
  
Here's an excerpt from a PROFESSIONAL EA coder...  
  
"by limiting the licenses will ensure that all those who purchase this EA don't suffer liquidity issues by everyone trading the same pair as their accounts grow. As had happened with other famous EAs. The smaller the foot print this EA makes on the market, the better it is for all of us."  
  
Call me an idiot if you want...wait till you start trading LIVE (which most of you won't) after 3 consecutive winning trades your broker will start dumping the connection, canceling your trades etc... there are hundreds of these stories...just use GOOGLE

I have an improvement on this system  
1) Get a coin.  
2) Flip the coin.  
3) Heads go long.  
4) Tails go short.  
5) Don't bother with a stop loss.  
6) Let trade run until hell freezes over.  
  
No wonder you're hoping for the HOLY GRAIL to just be GIVEN to you.   
  
Pathetic...have you tried creating YOUR OWN strategy or do you just surf the Factory ragging on other peoples thoughts.?

Ah, I think you missed the point.. this is called sarcasm but if you want to believe it's a strategy, go ahead by all means, start flipping!  
  
Regarding the other non-sense, get a real broker. They don't f with your trades. You are just spreading the same old sore-loser b.s that every one harps on and on about. It's always the brokers fault. Yeah.  
  
I hope you don't consider the number of posts == to successful trading or you will be sadly disappointed.  
  
Go ahead friend, take your next shot. I really don't care about you or what you have to say. The first lesson I learned about trading is to ignore your type.   
  
Happy Holidays.

What has become clear once again is; there will always be vested interests trying to prevent successful strategies and systems from entering public domain. Whatever their interests are, they must take note that consistent performers such as fapturbo and megadroid are being used on live accounts by thousands without affecting liquidity or trade quality.  
  
I have seen such attempts previously on here, for no reason an individual or a group of like minded people suddenly show up on the noteworthy threads and either begin discrediting the system or scaring the developer away.

Mainly an issue with low liquidity and hence high spread pairs like EURCAD. Not so much with EURUSD. The EA will need hidden SL/TP and order resend functions, along with the already mentioned emergency SL (as Steve Hopwood calls it, "shirtsaving").

Yes, there are always the paranoid that believe all the lies and stories of other losing traders. Probably naysayers that dont want others to win with a twisted thought that the more that people lose the more money for them, lol. I think I already heard them all in just 3 years of trading. "The broker chases my stops." "My broker reverses the market on me." "My broker dont let the market reach my ea's tp." Fap turbo and megadroid are illegal." "You can't win more than 10 times in a row without a loss." "If you make more than a million in less than a year rest assured you will be investigated by the FBI." "You need to have 4 different brokers and used them randomly if you want to win consistently" and many other funny stories even published by suppossed "pros" that only sell trading books and seminars of their successful strategies, but they never trade.   
Just let ematrader post his ea. It's not like everyone will run to their pcs trade live with 100 standard lots and will drain the market in 5 seconds. Most of us know MM and will not keep using an ea that produces more than 5 consecutive losses and no one will be federally prosecuted for using a profitable ea. So relax and wait! Happy Holidays to everyone!

Hey EMA.  
  
Thank you for your generosity.   
  
Now, I was wondering if you are running this EA on a demo account at the moment in preparation for release? If you are, would it be possible to publish some of those results, or a link to MT4Live.com, or similar?  
  
In anticipation,

**Ematrader** have you tried to run the EA on demo in real time ? because there is a lot of EAs that show miracles on back test and fail in real time due to the methods of calculations used in indicators

1 pip tp with a broker that has an $8 per lot commission isn't good. You would pay out $8 on a $10 trade at 1 lot.  
Also are the settings for a 5 digit broker automatic, and are ECN orders that can't be opened with TP or SL recognized by this EA

My hats off to anyone who would put this much time and effort into programing an EA just to give it away. At least allow us to send donations for your time once its out.

In what timezone does ematrader reside?  
  
  
Just wondering because there might be a lot of "It's 12:30am and the ea hasn't been posted yet..."

Srsly man look , you said that broker will try to dump your connection etc,etc , but now simply math ok if this bot provide 100 traders in 1 day with 1 pip profit YOU WILL EARN 100pip , broker if he had average 3 pip spread he will earn 300 pips , broker will just love u ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

Hi EmaTrader,  
  
I've watched your video.  
  
A lot of non-technical movements underwent on M15 between 2001-2008, such as Schedule News Announcement, Breaking News and Central Bank Intervention. Personally, perhaps, due to my knowledge limitation, I can't imagine how it is possible for a technical method, especially a mechanical method executed by an EA, can overcome fundamental disturbance caused by news.  
  
It is amazing that your EA enjoys zero loss in hundreds of trades (100% hit rate!). I think even the most sophistic backtesting parameter fitting cannot achieve this. And as it seems you use only EMA to achieve this result. This is simply amazing.  
  
Look forward to forward test your EA.

Hi EMA,  
  
If you do read this thread again, I'd like to thank you for bringing my attention to the "Slope Direction Line", seems [wizardserg@mail.ru](mailto:wizardserg@mail.ru) wrote it - is that you?. The .mq4 shows its the moving average of the ma's. I'm now using this slope indicator code instead of a the parabolic sar indicator code for my system. Initial tests show it works much better.  
  
thank you

"dil" made a good point earlier. He said if we the ea is shooting for 1 pip trades, how would you profit if the spread is about 2 or 3. In other words 10 ea trades will mean cost at least 30 pips on a 3 pip spread. Brokers will surely be happy.  
  
Secondly, I want to know what broker ematrader uses? anyone know?

I suspect that with all the traders watching (with experience, skills, knowledge, of all types and levels) it's very likely this trading system will get a good "going over" and lessons will be learned, and hopefully, opinions will be shared...some honestly and some not.  
  
Happy New Year and Successful Trading 2010!!

What a wasted thread. It should be put in the recycle bin. Absolutely nothing producting in here, sadly.

Relax, he probably just wanted some free programming help, got it and moved on.  
  
Do you really think it was the holy grail? With 1 pip TP's?  
  
If so go look up C4 Scalping or Nitro trading...they have some pretty nice fake MT4 Screenshots of ridiculous "too good to be true" profits.

Most here seem to be ready to hang EmaTrader without a trial, the motto seems to be "Gimme this for free or you are a crook & a liar".  
  
If he wanted free programming he wouldn't have to open a thread or lie to you, there are free forums where coders do stuff for free.

I don't know whether I am lucky or not. I found this thread only 2 days ago and have spent quite a bit time to think about the feasibility of what posted here.  
  
In the reply to report forward result, Ematrader gave a screen shot. I don't think any of the values shown has problem. But there are two things missing for me to confirm it is forward result:  
  
1\. No Broker Name on the Chart - For real trading platform, the broker name would appear lower left of the MT4 Chart, while for backtesting result broker name may not be presented.  
  
2\. The order no of each order is intentional hidden. For real trade, the order no. should be have a particular digit format, but for backtesting, the order no. is in numerical sequence.  
  
Before I can see these two information on the screenshot, I am not convinced it is from forward trading. Success rate can be 100% if historical data is used with hindsight intentionally.

As said, trade success rate can be 100% if historical data is used with hindsight intentionally through an EA (or simply naked eye!![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)).

Ematrader put put a test EA here fr the programmers to look at. He said it wasn't his real version. But you can put it on a demo and try the 1 pip TP if you like. My guess is it works in a similar way to his final EA. If you look at the code it does use multiple MAs as a trigger.  
  
My thought is that the risk(no SL) to reward (1pip) is wacky especially if you're trading 1 full lot. I manually traded the slope system years ago and had some good results. But I was using the Daily charts with multiple timeframe agreement. I forget what the SL and TP were back then.  
  
I would agree with Scooby that it would be great to see ematrader put the EA on Myfxbook to see real trading results. I'd like to see one account trading his 5 minute strategy and then a second trading a higher timeframe strategy.  
  
Happy New Year to all!

I just went through his slope direction system thread until about post #320 where it all went to crap because people started adding other indicators. This looks like it is a multi timeframe (MTF) system that checks for the direction of three timframes and makes sure that they are all moving in the same direction. This is a very simplistic apporach and logical method to trading. If you go through that thread and take note of what indicators are posted where in the thread, Ronald Raygun has done a lot of work on this already including an EA, it would not be that difficult to code this with something like:  
  
If timeframe longest trend = UP  
If timeframe long trend = up  
If timeframe short = down then up = BUY   
  
That's it....very simple  
  
It may be worth going through that thread in the event ematrader has left the building. However, he may have been at a very 'exciting' new years eve party, familiy emergency, etc. and is not available right now. Either way...I'm already working on this......  
  
Happy New Year!

I believe the long term slope system is quite good, If you are no longer trading it, have you found something better?  
  
Best Wishes for the new year

The "EA"?? this guy made was done using an online code generator, the Expert Advisor Builder website, as seen from the mq4 file he posted. Why would anyone expect this to be the best EA in the history of the world. He may have tweaked it to fit the backtesting data perfectly, but going forward is quite a different animal. LOL. Oh and I forgot to tell you 1 pip TP and no SL....keep on waiting guys and gals...but you are better off going to the code generator site and doing it yourself. It's not so difficult to do...he apparently did it with very limited MQL programming knowledge.

Hi people,  
  
I think the post by Darkstar on the link below will be help/enlighten some folks on this thread:

Also, maybe the impatient gentlemen here should be a bit more thankful and give ematrader a break - he has already given you a "Method/System" to use, maybe one of you could get a programmer to code it for you, it shouldn't be too difficult - all it requires is dosh.  
  
Good luck

Hi  
  
I can understand people being angry. But please be patient, maybe ematrader is busy or can not post or something has happened to prevent him posting in this forum. Maybe he did not have time and there is no EA. If we wait I ma sure if the guy has gone through the trouble of starting a thread he would let everyone know.   
  
Happy and very Prosperous new year to all.

Is the slope indicator built into the ea, or if that is required, is there a specific version of that needed?

Thank you ematrader for posting an EA as promised. Can you please explain what you have discovered when you have used a stop loss?   
  
Also, what is the difference between this V2 ea and the v4.5 that you originally posted the results from? Have you decided to keep that version to yourself, or does this have overall better results than v4.5?  
  
Cheers

Hopefully by then i will be able to post the complete guide how to trade this EA. since this is not the final version, it is "semi-automated" ea.   
  
Unfortunatly, I had some big issues with the final version when i ran it live with "ibfx". The final verison will be only posted if these issues are solved. I hope you guys can understand that.

I am getting 130 errors. These are usually associated with to tight of stops but if the stop is set to 30 as default that doesn't make sense. When I run it throught the backtester it never takes a trade just gives me the 130 error in the journal.

error 145 is Modification denied because order too close to market.

Yes it will work for those dates. But it fails during the huge trend reversal in Aug-Oct of 2008.   
  
If an EA is to be successful it needs to be able to operate in all market conditions. This one appears to have problems in trends heading South. If you trade without stops and can endure DD as long as you are in the general trend direction all is good. But if the trend reverses and you hold without a stop it can destroy your account. If I am wrong I would be happy to be corrected but this EA will have open trades in DD if you trade without stops and the trend goes short. Many folks lost a lot of money during that reversal. 

Over confidence can be a moral hazard.... not to mention a financial one!

Thanks ematrader,  
  
I think you have done too much work already. Let me help you to explain about the date between 2001 and 2008.  
  
With a Buy-only no Stop Loss setting, yes it is a 100% success rate system! And it is really profitable and easy to operate.  
  
Thanks for your New year present!

I will wait for the rest of the strategy. My only point was that buying the Euro during that time frame was always a winner trade if you held it. But When the big reversal hit and the Euro bottomed out at 1.25 area.. well a lot of buy strategies lost money and ended in margin calls.  
  
I wold love to know what you would have done to protect the strategy when the Euro fell from it's high of 1.6 down to 1.25 without almost any retracement.   
  
I am not trying to be negative, I just speak from experience, as I blew up an account during that time with a similar strategy. Since then I am very cautious about EAs that work during certain dates but fail during others. You have to have a back up plan for such contingencies and often those back up plans make the strategy less appealing during "normal" times. I will continue monitoring the thread with great interest.

I hope I could have been able to predict the big Bullish trend for the next few years when I was at 2001. Otherwise, success will only be guranteed with hindsight! hahahahahhahahahaha.  
  
But if I have this kind of predictive power, I don't need an EA at all to help me to become extremely profitable. hahahahahahahaha

Ematrader will you be sharing the full version? I hope so.   
My backtest trades work successfully except for the last trade. Do you know why?

ematrader,   
Great job and I think it's awesome that you're sharing some of your work with everyone. I wish you the best year with this business as well as everything else in life.  
  
I was just reading through some of the posts, I rarely read these forums at this point and now I remember why. Honestly, can you people just stop and think for a second, and read what he has to say instead of just babbling on about nonsense?  
Numerous times he mentioned that this is a SEMI-AUTOMATED EA, that he is testing his stuff on V4.5 and this is only 2.0. He also noted to wait until he writes up the damn thing before you start trading this demo or live and this is only to test it on specific historical data.  
Why in the world can't you guys just wait, do as he said and test it if you're interested but don't give him crap about an unfinished product because IT's NOT FINISHED.  
  
He already shared more than probably most of you and if you can't see the benefit of his work then you're just blind. He is providing you with a technique, entries/exits, a basis for a strategy. He is not your mum and won't hold your hand 24/7 while you use something that he made out of pure enjoyment and trying to help you guys. Whether he will release the final thing and how final and fully automated it will be is for him to decide. Maybe a fully automated EA isn't the best idea in this case and maybe it's better as a semi.  
  
Here's food for thought if you haven't thought about it yet to improve your trading if you are interested in what he's doing here and maybe you're just oblivious. ematrader is providing you with a way to get into the market and out profitably. That is one small part of trading. Look at the entries/exits, where, when they occur. Drawdowns, how to maybe filter them and pick the best ones or manage your money and the position. A static optimized SL/TP is not always a best way since volatility in the market changes due to many variables, maybe a dynamic SL/TP would be better. I'm sure there are many things you can take a way from his system and I know I had an idea for something I'm working on from it that I will have to test out so I'm grateful.  
  
I'm sorry ematrader about rambling on in your thread, shoot me a msg if you want me to edit this out, but it's really upsetting me because a lot of the time talent and raw ideas and new products get shunned because there's just so much drama and hype about nothing to the point where it gets annoying and too time consuming to keep on going. I'm glad you have the patience and wish you all the best.

its great.  
some of the trades in gets into can be pretty hairy, in some trades it can be inthe hole more than 1000 pips, and yet it still holds out for long periods, this would be to much for me to tolerate on a live account. sooooo i will have some thinking to do about this, and it would be a sound idea if i am CERTAIN the market is in a srong north trend.....  
  
hmmmmmmmmmm 

if i used every commercial EA i would be a brazilianare by next week!!!!

Hmmmmm. I'm sure EmaTrader has fully tested with the use of a Stop Loss but it sure would be hard not to have one on a live account. Would be interesting to see how a Stop Loss effects the win/loss ratio and overall profitability.   
Who knows, maybe the v4.5 strategy EmaTrader is yet to release uses a emergency S/L??? Guess with a bit of patience we will see.

EMA much thanks for this. I would suggest contacting SteveHopwood on FF who I'm sure would be more than happy to take your EA to the next stage. He's an awesome coder and very giving.

Hi EMA,  
I have been following your thread and like to crongrats you on a fine job.  
After seeing your thread last year, it gave me inspiration to develop a pip raiding EA also. Although it works successfully you would need capital to run it as I use 500 pip stops for just 7-12 pips rewards. Although it runs 98% accurate on its entrys, it will get caught in long term trends.  
  
I am only mentioning this as I will can offer assistance when it comes to progamming. If you need any help I will be more than happy to get your system perfected. The more fingers in the development makes for a better grail.  
  
PM me if you need any help with the development. I am also happy to discuss what I have created, all be it a simple system.

When more details unfold (EMAs manual) I would def. recommend that!  
  
If it is worth pursuing.....   
  
and there IS a "Next" level for the EA.....  
  
Mr. Stevehopwood will take it there!  
  
And to say "Giving" is an understatement!!! (imho)  
  
Anyway I DO like what your thinkin over there cgldsmth!!

naww...you are not missing anything...but don't be so negative...if exactly the same data as the data tested happens to occur again in the future, ..well then you will not have any losing trades...just save the EA in case this 1 in a trillion occurence happens...and if this 1 in a trillion occurence were to happen again, you would not know until after it had already happened...too late load the EA. LOL

The EA seems to work OK on the right side of a tranding market... but the big draw down (see the chart) is not ecceptable and it might bust one's account when trend reverses.

Just remember this thought. There was a guy selling an EA and showed a 100% win rate over a 7 year period. It was the EUR/USD and all it did was buys. What no backtest shows is where you get killed on retracement on these things. Backtests are not reliable indicators of how an EA works in real time. See pic below. 2001 to May 2008

I prey to god that nobody tries to run this on a live account. But I guess the only way for people to learn is the hard way. Any CB interventions or major reversals and you will end up with ZERO in your trading accounts.

Yes. I've posted the same chart eariler @ post #272, but the backtesters just keep ignoring the bigger picture and the truth. Best Wishes for all!

Hi Ematrader,  
  
Thanks you for the new version EA. I tested it according to your setting - without SL, TP 30, TS 18 using the time period 01.012008 to 31.01.2008.  
The reults looks good until the last trade#98 which show a huge loss.  
Please let me know what went wrong.  
Thanks.  
Emmanuel

Guys, the ea is only programmed to perform well in a bullish market, it only do BUYS. No sell and worse of all is that it needs No stop loss to do good, the trend reverses and your account is fried within minutes.  
  
I know I wouldn't go live with this ea, not even with my worst enemy's money. I am not prepared to lose so much money! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)

Oct. 2008 had the biggest moves ever in Forex, at least in the last decade. That month was an aberration not the norm. No EA or trading system will survive that month unless it was lucky enough to be on the right side of those monster moves. The problem with backtesting is it does not show what can be done in real time. I dont recommend running an EA during certain news periods and many will do fine if you follow some basic rules. All EAs are based on some kind of indicators and indicators do not show or predict big news movement. If on Jan 4, 2010 the USA raised its interest rate by 1 point no indicator is going to help you with the market moves for several days. So dont even bother with back tests during those kind of times, even with SL they wont give you the real picture. Backtest can only at best let you know two things. Your EA works and what it will do on a general basis. If you dont believe me, do what I did. I ran an EA for one month and then ran it on a backtest for the same month. The compared results were not very close. Until this EA is forward tested you will not really know what will happen. However, a no SL system will always run into a perfect storm at some point so there must be a place of cutting your loses. It is just part of trading that you have to mentally deal with.

I agree that without a SL this ea will eventually blow an account. Also the drawdown would be quite big.  
  
One option would be to look into adding a hedging strategy to the EA when the trade started to move against you. Ex: long trade moves 50 pips against you enter a short trade. Trade moves another 50pips against you enter another short trade. (The 50 pips is an example. You;d have to experiment and optimize)  
  
I still think a reasonable SL is needed

I thought here (forexfactory) traders are very well educated or atleast they are here to learn and share the trading ideas. People here can't even follow what i said. ow many times i said backtest only during these dates, and do not trade on demo or live untill i will post the complete guide. By the way this is beta 2.0, this one only have ema system and works from single time frame. the final version works from mutitime frame and have both ema and slope system in it. i've been trading with this system now almost 6 months. Anyways, i'm was not selling, and will not sell this system at any cost.   
  
To cut it short, i'll post sell only ea from beta 2.0. in few min. I'll not take my time to write how to trade this system. When we know ... place sell ea or buy ea. If you like it you guys may continue the thread from here on. Or even start a new one to disscuss between you guys.   
  
I did not knew i will have to deal with such people here @ FF.  
I was not really sure why 95% of trader loss money, but i'm pretty sure now.  
  
Happy Trading.

I'll try to simmer the fire that's brewing here a little before ematrader splits early. I jumped the gun as well on the dates and I apologize for that.  
  
Any successful trader will tell you that to follow the long term trend is where you want to be. If you have an EA that recognizes that and only trades in that direction and has positive results, great. Thinking ahead here...I've been following Phillip Nells 4 hour strategy here and it is a great method to determine the strength of the trend. Since ematrader's EA only places buys for now, then when that 4hr longer term trend is up, run this EA...that's how I would use this with that 4 hour method. If the trend is channeling or down, don't run the EA. ematrader said this is a semi-automatic EA, meaning there must be some human internvention with it = yes YOU actuallly have to do something. I'm thinking this is an early version of the EA and along with the directions to be posted later, I'm sure there will be a downtrending version that gets upload here later. Unless of course the lack of patience here runs him off. Channeling trends are where some EA's get killed but there are a few simple indicators FOR THE LONGER TERM CHARTS that you can use to tell you to stay out. This is where the semi-automatic intervention may come in where you have to determine which buy only, sell only, or no trade variables are set. This is what I'm working on so I'm just thinking out loud with all of this.  
  
Give ematrader a break, chance, time, whatever you want to call it and let's just see what comes out of it all....  
  
  
And there ya go....YOU determine the trend direction and run it...

After reading the posts of the last few days I completely agree with your last sentence. Some of the posts were constructive but the great majority came accross as posturing children. Some of us who have been following this thread greatly appreciate your efforts and desire to share them publicly. Personally based on the recent comments in the foregoing posts I would have been out of here long before you decided to pack it in. Nobody needs to put up with this kind of BS particularly when you are trying to be helpful. I will look over your EA's and forward test them on a demo and if I feel that I can offer constructive suggestions I will PM you. Thanks for the effort. We are both out of here.

ematrader or anyone else that is familiar with the slope indicator mentioned in the first post, how is the trend change calculated? Is it just the cross of a few WMA or is there something else to it? I looked over the thread where ematrader discussed his manual system but again a lot of it is just filled with nonsense, I couldn't find the actual mechanics of the indicator discussed.  
  
Again, thanks ematrader for sharing your methods and putting up with all of this,

But at the last trade, it says "close at stop" under "type" of trade in the results. Hence, produces a huge loosing trade. Does anyone know why?

This has already been covered. You need to add a zero to TP and TS, etc.

You simply cannot expect a novice programmer to code an expert-advisor which will have consistent profits.  
  
In London, trading companies pay groups of programmers 60K plus to develop/maintain trading systems.  
  
The key to any long-term successful expert advisor will be how well it is able to "Adapt/Change" its entry/exit criteria. You can either:  
  
1\. program it to adapt on its own (this will require substantial code, certainly some form of relational database involved and object oriented programming)  
  
2\. have a human element (input), that helps the expert advisor understand how the market is trending or which strategy to use.  
  
  
With both points, one would need to employ a series of strategies which the human or program would choose to use for an interval of time.  
  
I commend ematrader for his efforts.  
  
Good luck all

It can and is done by using known market patterns with +/- degrees of deviation.  
  
My trading floor employees people todo this but what it does is give BUY/SELL/CLOSE signals, it is then upto the individual trader to accept or ignore based on his/her knowledge of the current market conditions.

ematrader,  
  
please include the equity recorder library from here: <http://codebase.mql4.com/6217> into the EA and then produce a proper equity chart and post it here. Your Balance-Curves are meaningless, we need to see the total equity instead which is the only important number in this whole game.

I have used Fap Turbo, Steinitz and Pipzu and they all have stops and still blew up accounts, so my point is to learn to trade yourselves and use the email feature in the EA to analize entry in the trade. Only take positions with the trend from the higher time frames. Give Ematrader a break He is only like a lot of us trying to get meat for the gravey.

Hi Ema  
  
I am not sure if you are reading posts here or not, would not blame you if you don't. I thank you for sharing your EA. I will try it on demo as you suggested and I will wait for further instruction/documents/versions etc.  
  
It will be fun to forward test it. I am aware that you mentioned that the EA is for 15 min TF or higher, therefore I assume that 4hr and daily tfs are also suitable.  
  
Cheers and thanks. 

What you do is a reflection of you....what I do is a reflection of me.

Shame, Shame, Shame....  
  
I have been following this thread since last year (2009), and I must say, I totally agree with ematrader. I thought ppl come here to learn n share. Ematrader is trying to share, NOT TO SELL his system.   
  
And worst of all, I don't think he forced anybody to come and read his thread. He has repeatedly stated that the version he posted is beta V.2, which means it is not the final version. He has repeatedly stated just try to backtest on a specific dates. He will post the final version when it is available.  
  
To those of you who are so SMART, can't you understand what he meant? Why did you come to this thread in the first place? Coz you wanna know if his ea can make money for you, right? Why can't you let him finish his work and present the final version? Then, and only then can you post any criticism to the ea.  
  
If you don't like what you see, by all means, go somewhere else. I believe there are still others who would like to follow this thread.  
  
If you are so SMART, why don't you share your trading system. I am sure you are not doing so well yourself. So give others a chance to share theirs.  
  
Sorry if my comment sound disturbing. I just wish that in this New Year, we learn to give people a chance to share their thought. We are not forced to, in any way, to follow. SO, if we don't like it, just leave..  
  
Happy New Year and Happy Trading...

Pipchaser,  
  
I agree with you completely and hope ematrader will come back to the thread. Although, I'm not sure he will at this point and I don't blame him a bit. I personally trade several systems and markets ( forex, s&p 500, russell 2000) but am always eager to learn new things. That's what makes a successful trader....one who is eager to learn.  
  
Cheers.....

Dil,  
  
No offence but what you have just said means nothing to me, at least. What i mean is don't bring this (_i have better ea on live 100% a month_) up if you are not prepared or willing to share with us here in FF. By just simply making a statement or saying without any support or evidence, you are just TCSS.  
  
Well, i do hope you will prove me wrong later. If so, please accept my apology.  
  
P.S. If you do not know what's TCSS, ask a Singaporean or Malaysian friend.

Here is a very simple EA that has some code that I think you may be able to integrate into your EA to solve some of your programing problems.  
  
Enjoy.

Hello Everyone,  
  
Happy new year everyone and may this year bring you more pips and less drawdowns...  
  
I am programmer and have had a hand in doing lots of coding on MT4 here and there..  
  
I need to bring to your attention something about EAs...  
  
Whatever EA that your program and find successful without SL will eventually blow your Account because of difference in Equity and Balance curves..  
  
I wrote several EA and was amazed by how well they do on Strategy tester... and I came to 1 single conclusion...  
  
If you need a good EA then u need an EA that requires human intervention...  
  
Ematrader presented his EA and yes it is working and works very well but u need to work with it too not pure Auto.  
  
All my EA and EA I program for people I ask them to manage the trades **WHY?** too much assumptions that EA makes are what we hard code to it so some might not be exactly what we need.  
  
Time period are not relevant to working of an EA, your decision on when it should trades are what are very important...  
  
My advice to Ematrader... Look @ the direction of Higher TF make sure you are not against them @ all cost because TREND is ALWAYS YOUR FRIEND it will get you out of Err eventually..  
  
Just my 2 pips brain...

Nope I am not wrong if u play any EA without SL with a period and the test ends before the trades come to your direction it will surely have that angled end we are seeing people posting here...  
  
If it is working ok it means trades are always closing in your direction or you have counter measures which any smart person must put.. Some will martingale and some will hedge depends on you...

> Oct. 2008 had the biggest moves ever in Forex, at least in the last decade. That month was an aberration not the norm. No EA or trading system will survive that month unless it was lucky enough to be on the right side of those monster moves. The problem with backtesting is it does not show what can be done in real time. I dont recommend running an EA during certain news periods and many will do fine if you follow some basic rules. All EAs are based on some kind of indicators and indicators do not show or predict big news movement. If on Jan 4, 2010...

No trading strategy? Lucky? In october alone that month I made more pips than a normal year... I wished every month was like that particular October you speak of... I raked in almost 12,000 pips that month alone !

12,000 pips. Live or demo? Full lot or .01 per pip? Not being negative but I've traded for 5 yrs and never made more than 950 in a month trading full lots live. Care to share your secret?  
  
Clarification: 950 pips were made once in Jan 2009 trading gbp/usd and Eur/usd and it was somewhat lucky as eur and gbp dropped dramatically in Oct 2008 with fall of Bear-Stearns. I average about 200-275 per month....if I'm lucky.

I was talking about EAs. Most of them either got killed or had record hauls. My point is EAs are indicator driven but major News stories overide indicators. That is my point. If you back test an EA and it fails during the month of OCT 08, it doesnt mean it is a bad EA just that it is not designed for major news events. That is the point I was trying to make. Sorry if that wasnt clear.

I agree. My experience with EAs over a 3 year period is you need to know what the trading philosophy is so you can overide it (human intervention) when something happens that the EA cant handle. That is why buying an EA without knowing its weaknesses (all of them do) is a recipe for a disaster. Actually I have done better countertrend trading than trend trading because price will always retrace but the trend may not. You dont know when or where the trend stops or starts and when you recognize a trend it probably will change when you enter. Peter principal thing.

As with any Trading Strat: EA to be Successful:  
  
It does not have to trade... It has to let the market come... It should not chase the market...  
  
Any successful Forex Trader know that this are the Key of any Trading System:  
  
950pips a month I will live like a King.. 12000pips a month well I will buy the moon...

Hi, first post here but I would like to ask what growth you saw from 12,000 pips? What were your position sizes? 12,000 pips can be the same as 1,200 pips if using different MM.  
  
Regarding EA: I guess the manual is no longer forth coming?

making a thousand pips a month is not so hard. all u need is discipline and understand hw market move. on the minimum i make 500pips a month, by the way that my monthly target and i risk around 10% (awesome ryt) dont be surprised. i learnt this by blowing several account but now im there.so making 12000 pips a month by trading purely mechanical method is more than possible.i have made 5000pips before.i dont use a complicated system but a very very simple methods.i dont realy believe in stuffs people say around here and all the books i have read. if u wanna know more u can pm me.  
let me give an example. GPBJPY move an average of 500pips on a 4hr swing and that happen let say 3 to 4 times a month. if u can catch lets say 100 to 200pips of that, do the math what will that be in month???and lets say u trade two pairs. u can see its very very possible

live  
  
risking 1.5% of equity per trade, so the lots vary. Please understand that I don't want to disclose the size of my account.  
  
there's no secret. It's simply following price. i buy strength and sell weakness.  
  
of course October was an abnormal month and 2008 an abnormal year... i don't ever expect to get that results again...i wish.   
  
Although 2009 was more normal it still managed to get an average of 900 pips per month, May and July were the biggest months with more than 1500 pips each.  
  
best wishes of a profitable 2010 to everyobody

i guess it depends on the EA's.  
  
if we're talking the normal and common EA's of scalping etc like fapturbos and megadroid's of this world, i would agree with you. but my strategy is simple enough to be transformed into an EA and I'd bet the results would be very similar to manual trading. it all depends on what the strategy the EA is based on is.

i know. Pips are not important because one can have positive pips and have a negative P&L or negative pips and have profits to show. it only makes sense stating pips if we use the same position size for every trade. For someone that has a variable position sizing etc it's the bottom line that matters.  
  
anyways if i remember correctly without reaching for my records, october increased my account around 100+% risking 1 - 1.5% per trade.

Hi All  
  
I would love to learn a system that could safely get me 900 to 1000 pips per month.   
  
Would anyone who has such a system please share that system with the forum.  
  
I would really appreciate it - I recently lost my job and I need to find a new source of income.  
  
Thanks in advance for any help offered.

If you are new to the Forex market, and I'll assume you are, it takes time to become a profitable trader. Some people become profitable in months and some never do. This forum is a great place to learn. Salvador has a method he uses and I'm sure he has spent alot of time refining his entries and exits. I have a method I use ( THV4 from Cobra ) and it's profitable for me. I average 200-275 pips per month on full contracts ( $10 per pip ). I'm retired so it supplements me very well but it is still work. My goal for this year is 30 pips per day.  
  
Good luck.

Your first priority is looking for another job. If you've truly caught the trading bug, learn about the subject in a calm environment without the worries of paying bills.  
  
There are a few exceptional individuals who learned to trade profitably in less than a year but that's very rare. I can assure you that the level of effort to learn to trade profitably is equivalent to earning a degree. There are many aspects to this business and you can't gloss over any of them.  
  
Trading isn't like learning to juggle or some other parlor trick that someone can show you in a few hours. 

You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.

Dear Jim  
  
As they say no pain no gain. This is a great place to learn, you lost your job so you have plenty of time on your hand. Study Audio, Study video, Study text, Study Charts. There are great resources for free (do not need to buy expensive books, DVDs etc) so at this time when finances are in bad shape you do not need to spend any money, although I think it is better to read large volume of text printed rather than on screen. So a printer, Ink and paper would help.   
  
open 2 or 3 demo accounts and practice different systems, etc. I totally agree that to be successfull trader you need to 1st Degree standard (i.e. at least 4 to 6 hours per day for at least 12 to 18 months).  
  
Good Luck.

Salvador,  
I would like to program an EA based on your trading style, can you let us know your simple strategy and i am sure with the help of the forum, it may be possible to have a successful EA, either semi-auto or fully automated.  
thankks

Same here beejay, I wouldn't mind knowing either.   
I can code EAs as well, so if anybody has a profitable, MECHANICAL system (a system with strict entry, exit rules) that they'd like converted into an EA, please PM me.

Your first priority is getting another job.  
  
Trading with pressure on you in order to get an income especially in your situation, usually goes the bad route.  
  
my method is nothing fancy. Just ATR stops and going with the trend. I don't day trade due to time constraints so I'm more of a swing trader so value per pip can't be higher if i would be day trading. Once I finish college I'll make a decision to either find a job or experiment for a few months the day trading business.  
  
As for the method is pretty simple. Going with the trend. I also use EW theory but just in order to identify the choppiness periods and know when they are over.  
  
I wouldn't advise for you to go day trading. First find a job. Then gradually try to save part of your income to an account and start to trade bigger timeframes. Dailies are pretty good in my opinion. You won't win as much money due to pip value but the priority is having the execution right, and the dailies are more forgivin

I will look into it and warn everybody if i decide to share.  
  
I have a simple one that I shared in another forum if you want to take a look:  
  
I have no idea how it performs on lower time frames and how successfull it is in Forex.  
  
In equities it has worked very well on the dailies, so it is my assumption it MAY work on lower time frames as well...   
  
<http://www.donnaforex.com/forum/index.php?topic=82.0>  
  
To sum up is:  
  
RSI(55) and RSI(14)  
  
if both above the 55 level, trade long. Accumulate everytime RSI crosses over 55 again if it gone lower than 55 at some point.  
  
Under 45 level is the same but for shorts. between 45-55 on RSI(55) I consider we may be in a sideways market, so trade carefully.  
  
I used ATR as stops or just higher lows or lower highs as stops.  
  
If one's long and RSI(14) goes under 55 level do nothing but be prepared if price starts to go down. if it reverses and goes over 55 again accumulate.  
  
again i have no idea how it works on lower timeframes but if you code we can check if it's profitable or not.

Salvador, can you speak to the "EW" theory? I'm with you on trading with the trend and have been using multiple Moving Averages. Works fine during the trend but the choppy periods eat me alive. Searching for some tips on identifying trend/choppy periods "in advance".  
  
Thnx,

I have made an EA that trades on the Salvador System, it is showing good results as a pipraider taking 10 pips per trade. I am just touching up the code to be allowed to trade both pips and with exits using salvadors system.  
  
I will post the EA tonight, ready for tests and see what recommendations others can add to it. Maybe EMAtrader can see if the idea can help his system as well.  
  
Thanks Salvador for the ideas.

Can anyone code this system into an EA? it's a powerful trading system for the GBP/JPY. Im not sure if it works for other pairs as well. It's a system which my friend purchased. The strategist is a lady in South Africa. Who aims for 30-50pips a night with one simple trade on 5min chart. Its supposedly really good and it uses Boll. Bands with RSI. Take a look at my attachment. It shows the instructions of the strategy. This will make a good EA because it's a simple strategy. Let me know if you or anyone believes they can code this into an EA.

Pips are not important because one can have positive pips and have a negative P&L or negative pips and have profits to show. it only makes sense stating pips if we use the same position size for every trade. For someone that has a variable position sizing etc it's the bottom line that matters.

Sorry, I have not finished the exit strategy for the RSI EA, I will have it done over the weekend for everyone to have a look at.  
  
but the system will need some improvements on a smaller time frame. lets hope we can get the input to make it work.

I have attached the RSI Based EA, it is not complete, but can be used to test the pipraiding section.  
settings are as follows,  
  
WaitState - Set in minutes, this is the amount of minutes the system needs to wait once a trade has been entered. It is used to eliminate whipsaws.  
Lots - how many lots to open per position.  
TakeProfit - used only in pipraiding mode, how pips to take profit.  
StopLoss - used only in pipraiding mode, how pips to before taking loss.  
PipRaiding - set to True to trade in pipraiding mode.   
False will set it into the RSI trading system, only the placement of the entry orders are functional in this mode at this stage. I hope to complete the exit strategy over the weekend.  
  
Pipfactor is used in the main trading system which is not complete, I will explain this setting in the next release.

thanks tokyojon i have no idea how it works on forex or in lower time frames as i said before but it may work i don't know.  
  
The rules regarding exits etc can be a bit tricky to code since they can be subjective (either at a higher low or using some kind of volatility stop).  
  
also whenever i'm long and see an acumullation signal, if that signal was issued at around the same price of a previous entry I ignore it, because there's no reason to accumulate one more entry if your last entry was still around break even.  
  
The goal here is to pyramid and have lot of entries along a trend, and only allowing one to be in the red. So if we happen to enter at the end of a trend we may be stopped out in the red for this last entry but then we already had 9-10 entries in profit accumulated.  
  
Here are a few examples on a couple of currencies and a stock index:  
  
Green with arrows are original entries... dark greens are acummulation points. orange is acummulation points for shorts. It served me well when i traded stocks during the bear market. Also it got me out of the way on the strong rebound on S&P500 in March. It triggered a buy only at 860 points although in some stocks i was trading i was already long at around March 13th because some stocks started triggering buys on both RSI's around that time, especially retail, tech, etc etc...  
  
Although I don't trade this system anymore it is now a sub-system of my main trading system/strategy. In my opiinion a trading strategy needs to have at least a couple subsystems like long-term, a trend based, oscilator based and mean revert system.

thanks salvador for the charts, i will have a look them over the weekend and see if i can come up with a complex equation on exits. I used the waitstate to try and and stagger the entries, but i like the idea of staggering the entries. I will include this in the next version.  
  
I will also use support and ressistance levels in the later version, as if the price is approaching a support, i would be hesitant to enter enter longs and vica versa.

I believe Salvador was referring to Elliot Wave theory.

I've heard of it but am not familiar with how it works. Any insights to this short of going back to school?

EW theory is something it requires study and practice just to get the handle of it... First time I got with it it was so confusing thinking of 1 of A of 2 of 3 of A. Geez...  
  
Anyways nothing to teach regarding it nothing better than going to the source... I'll post a pdf of the book later in here you can study from there...  
  
In summary I try to avoid larger degree 4th waves which are typically constitude of a pattern of 3-3-3-3-3 waves or a-b-c-d-e ; and take the form of a triangle  
  
Have a good weekend everyobody

Hi EmaTrader,   
  
Any Progress on this EA? I am sure if we can make it automatically take the Long/Sell based on the trend it becomes a very good EA.  
  
Please come back to help us to improve this.

Prakash

I am looking for a good profitable scalper EA but can't just find the correct one, your EA looks good but any EA that open trades instead of pendings? Or if you can direct me on the forum, would be appreciated.

Any system with a 99% win rate is a time bomb, that 1% loss is more than enough to wipe out your entire year of winning.   
  
The reason behind the big dip at the end should be more than obvious: low TP and high SL/NO SL.   
  
Be very afraid of any system with a 90%+ win rate, be very afraid.
