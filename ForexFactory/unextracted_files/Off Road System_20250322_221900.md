Off Road System.  
  
  
This thread is intended, in principle, for intraday trader and aims humbly cover most**market conditions** , if possible.  
The idea of opening this thread has its origin in those days when the market seems to wander, and we do not know how to treat it.  
This means that the system was created to solve indefinite markets, but also serves to well-defined markets. Hence the name Off Road System.

To try to systematize the intraday market condition, we will use a set of tools.  
  
M5-M1 _timeframe_ where will work. Timeframes higher, to see the forest.  
Exponential _Moving Average_ (EMA 233), (SMMA 150, also works well)  
_Bollinger Bands_ 50 periods.  
A _momentum indicator_ , which you prefer. For example, AWESOME, RSI or Stochastic. The trader decides what is best at all times.  
_Volume_ (optional, since it depends on the broker)  
Guidelines (or _trendlines_) accompanying waves during trading.  
  
All this, together with the general knowledge of market, news, sessions, support and resistance, patterns, waves, price action, etc ...  
In general, the moments of greater _liquidity and volatility_ should be preferred for trading. Probably almost always be the London session, but sometimes we can find good moves in the Asian session. It is the job of deciding when liquidity trader and rank, for fishing pips. We shall see examples.  
  
The basic template is the following.

The position and slope of moving averages, give us a first idea of the**market condition**.  
  
Example _clear trend_. The EMA233 and SMA50 have a clear slope and the slow moving average is outside the bollinger bands.

Example _flat trend_. Moving averages are nearly flat, ande EMA233 is into Bollinger Bands.

Example _indefinite trend_. EMA233 loses tilt and penetrates Bollinger Bands. SMA 50 frequently changes its direction. The figure is a complex wave form.

More market conditions probably be variants of these three, that we will see as they arise.  
  
The slow moving average and simple moving average of bollinger, use them to determine the market condition at a glance.  
Bollinger bands, their bands, into indefinite markets, are the areas where we pay more attention.  
Momentum indicators, or oscillators, we will prevent the end of a wave, at a given degree. And they give us another perspective of the price action.  
The volume gives an idea of liquidity, and their changes warn us that something is happening (eg volume stop, confirmation ruptures, confirmation reverses).  
The guidelines help us, along with the oscillators, the change in direction of a wave at a given grade. They are very important and we have to practice for use with the highest probability of success.  
  
Do not forget the**Big Picture** , and analysis multitimeframe.  
  
The completely flat situations, or totally trend will treat them as such, by the price action, and with the help of the same template. Trends, will learn to recognize candlestick patterns or chartists to recognize the end.  
  
This is an example of _undefined market_ , and how could treat it, using bands, guidelines, oscillator, and candlestick patterns.

General Rules.-  
  
System rules are subject to market conditions at any given time. For now, give a generalized guidelines for each market condition. Along the thread, if necessary go into more specific formulas.  
  
**Trending markets.** Seek inputs for the trend reversals within the Bollinger Bands or near the SMA 50, or in the Bollinger Band, opposite to the trend, if the correction is larger, using oscillators, trendlines, or candlestick patterns, or patterns of waves.  
  
**Sideways markets.** Reversals seek outside Bollinger Bands, using any of the tools at our disposal (oscillators, trendlines, candlestick patterns or waves).  
  
**Undefined markets.** We will treat as trading ranges (Sideways markets), but with special care.  
  
The three market conditions described here are always subject to the Big Picture and the general prior plan.  
  
The **stops loss** are discretionary depending on market volatility and the Big Picture, but it must always use.  
  
We will see examples of this, as they arise.  
  
  
For the ORS (**Off Road System**), the best **trades** are performed as follows, prior establishment of**market condition** :  
  
_Against the trend_ ; reverse **pattern** of the same grade.  
  
_In favor of the trend (My favorite now)_ ; retracement **within** bollinger bands (preferably). Clear break is valid.  
  
_Lateral trend and trend indefinitely_ ; trading **from** bollinger bands.  
  
All, at **waves same degree.**  
  
  
_PS: any help would be appreciated in language, if necessary change any word or phrase._

EURAUD daily.  
  
The general plan for the EURAUD, is a Fibonacci projection of the first great wave (colored ellipse) on the third major bearish wave.  
Naturally, some time (daily candlestick), there will be a good retracement.

Yes it is.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
You must use all the technical knowledge you have. And set the market condition, at a glance, through the position and slope of the moving averages and Bollinger bands.  
  
Work multitimeframe. And use stoploss.

GBPJPY and EURJPY  
This is scalping. There are probably re-entry. But this pair is crazy. We Will See.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
I'm done, almost. I have one long open EURJPY, and ended at the moment.

Could it be that the goal of GJ is 23% fibo, or round 181.000, or daily range?

In my opinion the safest level will be daily range in confluence with triple top.

I also think that there are high chances that way.

EURAUD  
  
The waves of the type "Wave 4", usually back 38% fibo generally.  
  
Although I have lost sight of this pair, because the JPY keep me busy.  
  
Big Picture of EA is bearish. But course correction in daily timeframe, can give uptrends in other timeframes.

EURJPY M1  
As this system is concerned, it might be safer to close the trade at some earlier critical point. That is, from the point of view of system, I made a mistake, do not close the trade. And wait for re-entry.  
But I still think that this pair is bullish intraday.

But notice that **there is not a clear trend** , then loses importance the long moving average, and gains importance bollinger bands and oscillators.  
  
This is a clear trend.

If you look west in your chart the trend is not clear.

You picked the retracement of wave 5. Good.  
  
The lateral position of bollinger bands, encouraged to take this retracement.

It is possible. We must look higher timeframes, and wait for confirmation.

Awesome M15, fails the Head and shoulders, yet. Awesome has made a new high, so be careful there.  
Awesome is the best indicator to count impulse waves. The latter waves, must diverge.  
  
Although there may be enough space for the shoulder-head-shoulder is valid at M1, if we reach the 38% fibo.

Yes it is working shoulder-head-shoulder at M1, but M15 remains bullish. We Will See.

It's easy. If we have an impulsive pattern formed by waves of the same degree, Awesome draw the maximum, at the peak of the third wave. Then in the fourth wave low below zero, or very close to the median 0, making a hidden divergence, and the fifth wave ends, same degree, with divergence.

Waves impulsives.  
  
If it does not, it was not a pattern of impulse, or the market has changed to a higher degree fractal.

I wouldn't rely on GBP - EUR even vs JPY   
nor for scalping...  
  
maybe focus on NZ/J intra?

I guess every trader has their preferences and nightmares. My nightmare is the GBPUSD, among the major currency pairs.  
There was a time when I loved making trading against GBPUSD, but now I avoid it because I do not feel comfortable with it.  
However, I feel good with the JPY currency pairs, in general.  
My mistake today with the EURJPY has clearly been a technical error.  
I had two opportunities to break even. The first is the crossing of the price of sma50, and just at the same time, indicators become bearish.  
Usually when this happens so as synchronized, the result is that it was a mini-trend change.  
And the second time was running the stop loss to BE.  
  
Nor do I understand, in time, there was a fifth wave failure. And I was always waiting for the price to make a new high. That was my mistake. Error mine and mine alone. The market made long ago, ie find liquidity.

As to NZDJPY, perhaps interesting to notice it.  
I dismissed it at the time, because I did not like the ratio spread / range. And it is a currency pair that I know less, EURJPY and GBPJPY that.  
I invite you to prove the thread that is worth to notice him, if you want.

Patron my friend are you always using awesome divergence to spot last wave?  
What if there is no divergence? Break of short trend it most likely not enough?  
And do you use awesome on every time frame? If yes, why do you change oscillators so frequently?   
Maybe others oscillators are better for spotting hidden divergence?   
  
Thanks in advance, I can't sleep without this knowledge ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

> {quote} Patron my friend are you always using awesome divergence to spot last wave? What if there is no divergence? Break of short trend it most likely not enough? And do you use awesome on every time frame? If yes, why do you change oscillators so frequently? Maybe others oscillators are better for spotting hidden divergence?

Each indicator gives me a somewhat different view of the price action at different levels and timeframes also. So I change indicator and. sometimes used together.  
As for the awesome, the Book of the Elliot waves I upload explains better than me use.

I have the impression that the EURAUD is in correction, but it is bullish, so beware.

EURAUD H4  
  
Big Picture. Seeking likely scenarios. A likely scenario would be a zigzag, in this situation. We always talk about probabilities, not certainties.

Also, note the position of the moving averages and Bollinger. What the system says in these conditions? Or break, or reverse. Price action.

I need to pay more attention to bollinger bands and 144 SSMA. I opened exactly the same trade, but I'm still in ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1)  
In other words I need to work on my exits, which should more based on market condition.

But if the slow moving average is flat and within bollinger, it does not matter, it's more important, in this case, the price action from any band.  
  
Pero si la media móvil lenta está plana y dentro de bollinger, eso no tiene importancia, es más importante, en este caso, la acción del precio desde cualquier banda.

Thanks for the clarification.  
  
This nuance is important unless for me.

The system provides three types of markets conditions (see post #1), market trend sideways market, and complex or undefined market.

Got it. There was my problem. I didn't know when to use M5 and when to use M1. The answer is simple, but I missed it. Thanks

If not mastered yet, M1, M5 provides enough opportunities every day. And while you're watching behaves M1, and accumulating experience, ie money.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

System rules are very simple.  
Establish **market condition intraday** at M5, through observation of the slope and position of the moving averages and how to shape bollinger bands (see post #1).  
From there, price action is concerned with the inputs.  
All this wrapped in the general knowledge of technical analysis.  
  
Big Picture and analisys multitimeframe help.  
Your favorite indicator (if you know it very well) help. That is an other view of Price Action.

I have not analyzed the pair, but at first glance so far is bearish.  
  
Bollinger bands are separated and moving averages are ordered and inclined down.  
  
Indicators pursue price without protest.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Watch Big Picture.

Thanks my friend.  
I'm done for today. It was hard trading day for my psyche.  
I need to get some rest and the next target is to find tune in new system. Which is very simple, visual and works well, but today I'm puzzled with it.  
See ya!

Patron,  
  
Can I ask you how many pairs have you in your watchlist? I see EA you like to trade. Also EURJPY. Do you maybe get the greatest ADR pairs?  
  
  
I adore your trading style. Wish I can reach a basic level and understand it.  
  
  
thanks

Considering the system, we must treat the market as bearish in this situation. Condition market, bearish. Only short.  
Perhaps it is a correction, similar to a fourth wave.  
  
Note the slope of the moving averages and how bollinger bands.  
  
We always talk about probabilities, not certainties speak. Nobody has the truth. The system must follow it with discipline.  
Otherwise, there would be a system would be discretionary trading, based on the experience of the trader.

We should not take breaks in a fifth wave, the same grade. Indicators diverge.

GBPJPY m5  
  
Breakdown with high probability of success.  
Indicators go to down. The wave is not fifth.

EURAUD M5  
  
The market has taken 16 hours to react with the _third wave_ upwards. This seems a flat correction, while I expected a zigzag.  
The market is **unpredictable**. We can only estimate **probabilities** for a plan.  
Here we see the utility of having a good **system** and follow it with discipline. The system never gave entry to the third wave the corrective upside.

Only the news unfolded that wave, a stop or a well placed trailing stop had stopped. Also, technically, the price had reached the base of a **channel** , and the trader should close his shorts.

EURJPY M5  
  
Market condition bearish.  
  
3 trades very easy  
  
The first trade is yesterday, and stayed in the pipeline, but as it is similar to the two today, I've placed, too.

Hi friend.  
  
Check higher timeframe please ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
EDIT:  
You shouldn't treat resistance levels as a line, but as an area. So that line that you draw it's not support line, it's still resistance area.

Patron I think that I need a little help with rushing my trades.  
  
On this attached example (sell), I had price on 62 fibo number, there was divergence on awesome indicator M1, there was breakout after divergence. And it was still not enough.  
How can I evaluate when to wait for divergence on m5 or m15.

> Patron I think that I need a little help with rushing my trades. On this attached example (sell), I had price on 62 fibo number, there was divergence on awesome indicator M1, there was breakout after divergence. And it was still not enough. How can I evaluate when to wait for divergence on m5 or m15. Please help me, if you will have a minute. Thanks ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) {image}

What indicates a **divergence**? a loss of momentum. In an impulsive pattern, this divergence usually occurs between the third and fifth wave.  
Does that mean that the market will change the trend? Do Not.  
If this is the first divergence, chances are concerned correction, probably the fourth wave, to that degree.  
But if we look, the higher timeframe and momentum indicator is bullish, continues high, without diverging, then chances are that the market will continue to rise.  
  
If To take advantage a divergence at M1 (against the upper timeframe), you only have an average of about 6 pips (sometimes three pips, sometimes 9 pips). The scalper must assess whether it is worthwhile to enter that trade.  
  
If you decide at M1 when the market will come back, consultations M5, you can change your mind, and assume it was a correction.  
The nature of the market is fractal, and fractals higher grade have priority. So it is better to use M1, in favor of higher fractal, in our case, we have to look for that fractal in M5.  
  
In this case clearly shows, that despite the divergence, or loss of momentum in M1, M5 indicators continue to rise. But that's not all, an analysis of previous major bearish wave, make us suspect that there is a high probability that we are facing a correction, the same level as that   
wave, this represents a significant retracement, we can leverage in M1 until the next relevant resistance; or to a level of fibonacci, from the previous bearish primary wave.  
  
To trade at M1 isolate is very difficult. We must always subordinate M1, at least I try to do so, to higher timeframes. M1 is at the service of higher fractals, just to refine as much as possible, at the entrances and exits.  
If we do a manual backtesting, find many terminals waves, as shown in the chart M5. Usually long and fast.

hi js, I'm just a novice sailor here but I think you could move the stop loss to breakeven when the price reached the bottom band.

EURJPY  
  
Thank You. Look, how how it looks M15. The slow average is far, that means oversold. Then look at the principal BEARISH previous wave, and find that it is very likely to be a major correction. Fibonacci I put and my goal is at least 38% of the previous major bearish wave.  
So I'll M5 and I find the price in a bullish channel (even against the trend).  
  
Then I will see M1 and clear uptrend at that level. Only I have to wait for price action ...  
  
But I never have the patience to wait, for exit trade. Whenever I close soon. I have to work on that aspect of my trading.

I agree. It was a way to, at least not lose a winning trade.

Friend, if you feel more comfortable with the DSS template, use it. With this template I felt quite safe.

Or use one mixed, as I did, sometimes.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
  
  
I deleted the crossing emas 34-89, because the pivot sma50 serves me, with the action of appropriate price.

No, it's not that. Moving averages give me the false feeling that I'm save and that price will bounce from them.   
I really like new template, I was puzzled because I was too much focused on awesome oscillator.

You must not do trading with any indicator, and less at M1. You must do trading with market condition, and multiscreen, and**PRICE ACTION**.

EURAUD  
  
**A stroke of luck controlled.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)**  
  
Some time ago I published a post where he thought about the market condition at the Big Picture of EURAUD.

Today before the news got a pending order for short below resistance correction.  
When the price broke the resistance dragged my pending order a few pips below, while I tried to enter a command to short more.  
The result was a great stroke of luck. Controlled luck, because the benefit / loss was much to my favor.  
Have general plans is a good thing, either to win when you hit, or to learn when you do not hit.  
For the system, we had a flat trend, and breaking it brought the fish.  
As waves, we had a flat no complex correction, easy to control, for those who bother to do the work to learn the basics of this type of correction.

This is perhaps the most difficult for the trader matter since **fractals** are intertwined, and what is **trend** in a given grade level to another is **correction**.  
  
I personally am guided by the following principle.  
  
"A trend begins with a **reverse pattern** of the **same grade** as the trend, and ends with a reverse pattern of the same grade as the trend."  
  
And Yes, your chart show a reversal pattern. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
If you perform backtesting manually, will see for yourself.

We seek if the system goes. We seek support and resistance. We looked at pairs relationships, direct or inverse. Time. The session. The multitimeframe analysis. Etc ...

I'm too short (UJ, also). But I'll wait a little longer at M5, to the first relevant support, or fibo. Will see.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)

USDJPY, GBPJPY, EURUSD.  
  
The tp, which was placed, have cut my earnings.  
Except for the USDJPY (+23 pips), which has worked well, at this moment; will see.  
  
It is the price of handling several pairs at a time.  
  
![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f973.png?v=15.1)Anyway, my quota is covered.

Reverse **patterns** have worked perfectly.  
We have to study, do more hours of backtesting, which of trading, until everything becomes automatic and easy to reach the highest level, **intuition**.

hi guys...  
  
I kept shorting UJ all the morning. Then I had to go out. When I came back I saw that I missed a great opportunity. Anyway, I just need one more profitable trade to finish my day...

I don't know about exact percentage. I put here all my traders except BE ones, from which I resigned in a minute (My psychological mistakes).  
If I am loosing, I'm uploading them too, than I'm asking Patron for a lesson ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
It's better way to learn, because in most cases you don't see your own mistakes.

Today I got one mistake for 12 pips. You can see it on the chart.   
Reasons were no momentum, and I had problem with identifying patterns (were two same patterns with opposite directions).  
And as you can see I've re-entered in the same direction.  
  
To my mind, holy grail you can find only in yourself.  
  
I'm done for today. Have a nice day guys ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

My comment.  
Market condition bearish. Triangle. Wait for the right time.  
Complex correction have 5-8 waves.  
The imbalance came with the American session. Volume increased, and the bears pushed the price down.

We have published losing trades. But I have not posted BE, like js. My reasons are lack of time, or errors that have nothing to do with the system or with technical analysis. Ie some errors that would contribute nothing to the thread.  
When I make a misconception, hereby publish.

As we know smma150 and ema233, have a very similar behavior, however, little nuances (within the scalping), I have convinced me to give priority to ema233. And so I left reflected in the first post, and the template.

morning patron. thank you and j. for your replies yesterday.   
  
today, I didn't start the day quite well. price stopping me out and turning back a couple of pips later makes me really sick!!! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f624.png?v=15.1) The problem was the place of the stops I guess. Any comments?

USDJPY M1-M5  
  
You closed your trades in an area of **support**. The supports are more important than the trendlines. In areas of support, long trades are more common, since breaking a support must be well confirmed. Normally no significant breaks before some news, or before a change of session (in general). The trendlines are _guidelines only_. In addition, EMA233 and lower bollinger band, also made support, and price action has not been short, below.  
  
At M5, the price comes from a _reverse pattern, double bottom_. Technically, the price should go higher (theoretically). The price went down, looking for liquidity, or to test whether there were bears. We Will See.

There are many ways to place the stop loss. The _initial_ Stop loss, we must learn to put it out of reach of hunters stops. Until the price, then we invite reposition stops better.  
You can use **fractals**(not the indicator but areas where the price should not go within a fractal, given, ie beyond the wave where we are).  
If this is not comfortable manner, other means, for instance, set the initial stop, few pips beyond the **slow moving average** (ema233 or smma150).

Hello Patron, still a bit problem with connection, because I'm connecting through the phone. My usual internet provider is having some technical problems.

USDJPY M5  
  
The system recommends paying attention to these areas: bands and proximity support area.  
In principle, at M5, Market condition is lateral.  
  
Vertical lines (BLUE) are time of news.  
Horizontal lines are daily pivots.

Price is **testing support**. Market look for bears. If not, then reverse.

USDJPY M1  
  
I try a reverse.  
Market conditio M5 is lateral.  
Stop initial under bollinger lower nearest.  
  
The initial stop loss is also manual, if I note that the market is firmly against me.

If the price breaks above a relevant fractal, then I will move the stop loss and draw near to the price, following the approach is appropriate in time.

USDJPY  
This long is aggressive. We can be a little more conservative, and wait for the price action at M5.

If this long is correct, should give between 30 and 60 pips (aprox).

Well, folks, I hope this trade is profitable. I've put a take profit close because I have to go.  
I am in the process of **moving** , and I have no choice but to answer it.  
Maybe back tonight (GMT + 1).  
  
**Bye**

Hi litts,  
Do you use bollinger bands as a one of signals to enter?

jst... and littspaniard,  
  
I see that you have had a good day.  
Congratulations to all!  
I've left an easy USDJPY. Does anybody has used?  
  
I had to put a take profit, because it would not be in front of the screen. I figured 30-60 pips. But it reached 133 pips!

I toke the same trade. But I can't resist and close it at +20 pips. Anyway, I'm happy because the three first trades with this system all have been positive.

I also usually leave the trades early. I'm working on correcting this.  
In fact last Friday, if I did not close my trades before is because I was not in front of the screen and placed a take-profit.  
Otherwise, if I have been in front of the screen, surely would have closed in the upper band bollinger because, at that time, the market condition was lateral and only two corrective waves were counted. And probably would have taken up a long trade in the lower bollinger band.

My plan for today is whether the yen will go up, or whether to continue reducing current downtrend (medium term).  
Ie if the Yen crosses will go up a little more, or go down directly. Given that the yen could become safe haven currency temporarily.

No one else has plan for today?  
  
A trader has to have an initial plan.

Yes, my plan is to get 30 pips as soon as I can. Don't know how, but I think today is better avoid all dollar crosses, because it's gonna be probably low volatility, due to USA bank holiday.  
  
I'm watching EURJPY, AUR JPY and CADJPY.  
  
  
any clue?

I'm not feeling comfortable with longs on yen yet. I will probably wait for shorts.

Sorry for my ignorance, what does ORS system mean? It's mean BO (breakout) system in M1??  
  
I'm trying to follow you. At the moment just could pick a little 8 pips with the AUDJPY.... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f62c.png?v=15.1)It's difficult to chose the moment to get in.

What was the mistake?  
  
Technician: A correction is composed of at least three waves of the same degree. There was only one.  
Psycho: impatience  
Tip: 90% of the time not just one trendline for the price reversed.  
  
Trader: Search probabilities of high grade.

Another possibility is that maybe I'm rushing my trades, because I'm looking for waves which have to small grade.

There has been no increase in market volume. It is noted that US banks have not opened.

The system is designed for any market condition.  
I get the impression that they want to reverse. But this can be misleading. Therefore, I will not open any trade reversal without been clearly confirmed.

Market is bullish intraday M5, but waves are advanced (in the pairs listed in the previous post). Maybe it's good to go long. In my case, I prefer to wait reversals, although not do more trades today.  
  
It is an opinion only.

Patron could you be so kind and comment this last four trades I made.  
  
As for me was:  
1st - 5 waves on m1, fibo 38, but I was waiting for corrective wave so it should have 3 waves, so do I should have to wait for 3 waves on m5?  
2nd - I thought that was 3 waves on m5, fibo 38 , bullish engulfing  
3rd - 3 waves on m5, divergence on awesome m5, fibo 50 , bullish engulfing  
4th - I've just added position to the THIRD one, with same reasons but better price. You don't have to comment it ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
I would like you to comment it, because it will be good for all of us to know, what do we need to look for to get the best entry possible.  
  
Thanks in advance! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Looking at the charts at M15, we will see that level, the trend is lateral, so I think that the waves are too advanced for long.  
This remains, just an opinion.

It is a very complex wave, there will be many ways to read. I do, more or less as follows.  
  
We could talk about the alternation (if the first is a zigzag, the other is likely to be a flat correction) between wave 2 and 4.  
We could talk about accumulation (wave 2) and distribution (wave 4).  
We could talk about fibo 50 is primarily in wave 2, and 38 fibo occurs frequently in wave 4.  
  
I think the trader can here use their smell, their experience, and a good divergence of a momentum indicator, or use the Chartism, which gives more late entries.  
And if it is not clear, it is best not to open trades.  
  
I do not know if I understand your question, comment in detail because this could take a long time.  
If you want to make a more specific question ....

In addition, it may be easier, use ORS (Off Road System), handling well the **initial** Stop loss and capital **management** , and **risk**.

The 4 is clearly the best because it originates in the lower bollinger band, because it does a mini-pattern of return (double bottom). Just had to wait the price action with pattern 123.

Of course it is a last one (4), in pips. I am asking about technicals.  
  
For instance that I should not take trades like number 1, because 5 waves on m1 is not enough.  
Or that I should wait for divergence always to be sure that I'm at the last wave.  
  
For me the best trade technically is entry 3. And I would like to know, if you agree with me?

The whole area is like. The problem of 3 for me is that, usually, Japanese candles that have more normal range tend to be retroceded and can almost always get the best price.  
For my liking after analyzing ña wave, I had chosen the 4, or a retracement of 3.  
Technicalmente correct, would enter the candle indicated by the arrow.  
  
Take this opportunity to comment that the "V" drawing the volume is characteristic patterns reverse.

I use "Recortes" de Windows 7.  
But you can do it with metatrader, too.

Metatrader

Save as picture  
  
Then you can choose to capture all or capture the active chart (as is)

Of course, not part of the system, but if you benefit?

For the ORS (**Off Road System**), the best **trades** are performed as follows, prior establishment of**market condition** :  
  
_Against the trend_ ; reverse **pattern** of the same grade.  
  
_In favor of the trend_ ; retracement **within** bollinger bands (preferably). Clear break is valid.  
  
_Lateral trend and trend indefinitely_ ; trading **from** bollinger bands.  
  
All, at **waves same degree.**

But that does not matter. If discretion is good, it's done. There is no reason to follow the exact system. The system is a guide, by the way, very good, to know where and how to find good trades.

That trade was in favor of the trend, which was actually quite strong, because it was in confluence with breakout from H1 channel.   
About bollinger, trend was so strong that it was impossible at that time to touch lower bollinger band, and price was rejected from middle bollinger line by double top with divergence on awesome indicator.   
  
It's not exactly ORS, but it was ORS in agreement with market structure at the time.

EURUSD and EURAUD (intraday)  
  
I've found time to post my trades.  
My initial plan was to observe the correction of EURUSD and EURAUD.  
  
When I got reverse patterns on the last wave of both pairs, I searched my trades for today.  
  
My quota is full. Now, I have to go. See you later.

if one day I can not stand this fascinanate world of probabilities, you are my successor, so I demand that you work hard and well, and do not take it wrong.  
You're a great trader, and just accept it without affecting your humility.  
You will come to you want, if you want really.  
If you do not affect the mundane little things. If buscasa beauty, harmony, art. The money will come, attracted later.

Hi isengoz  
  
Use hard emergency SL, that will help you with psychological mistakes.  
  
Try to wait for break of trendlines, it will give you more confidence.

thanks for the advice j. actually that trend line was the reason I pulled my stops to BE. sellers tried to break the line twice but buyers reacted with engulfing bars on both attempts which made me think that the time might not be right for those shorts.

GU is at really great place, but I don't trade this pair.  
However I think it was a little too soon for GJ, tha's why I asked.  
  
  
But it might be good in near future ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

I would like to remind our friends ORS (Off Road System, "TODOTERRENO" in spanish) is a system designed to establish, simply, the **market condition**.  
After which the treatment is as follows ...

The rules clearly state that against the trend reverse **pattern** is needed, the same grade as the tendency to undertake trades, against the market.  
This rule is very important because where else lose money non-professional traders is trying to figure out the end of a trend, or the beginning of another.  
The areas of supply and demand are very important, and we must take them into account in our trading. But what we can never do is open a trade, based only on one type of signal. There must be a**set of signals** involved in the decision of trader.

So Shantala.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
What you point on the chart, is a clear break in favor, with the added ingredient of the fresh money through the recent opening of the American session.

littspaniard, is noted for your ways you're a good trader, but watching your trades, in my opinion, you're too aggressive, which reduces the percentage of **odds** in your favor, and more with GJ.  
If you try to take corrections GJ, or try to guess the reverse, this pair will give you more of a scare. You should not look at the RSI, but when the price action or a pattern, do you think that the pair will change direction, to confirm. Indicators provide a point target price action view, but are not valid individual signals to make trading decisions.  
The **energy** given off by your posts, show your enormous potential. Just some control over your haste, and **consistency** will take over your trading.  
Thanks for your contributions to this thread.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

I appreciate your participation in this thread. You are a member of high impact. It will help a lot to the thread, and yourself, if your knowledge of the market (correlations between pairs, areas of supply and demand, etc ..), add the application the ORS system. The result would be great.  
Thanks in advance.

I do not do trading with the indexes. So I want to make a question.  
Is it a good time of day for trading? The European market has closed.

Thanks patron,  
  
The truth is that your analysis is very accurate. I hurry to win and makes me risking too much.  
  
Sometimes I use tight stoploss, sometimes hedging, etc. It depends how i see the situation. If the stop loss is tight I allow myself to re-enter the trade if there is a chance again.  
  
Once I'm in the attempt to fight to win, even using kicking, biting, pulling hair.  
  
overall I must improve my psychological aspect.  
  
thanks for being there

I understand perfectly. I myself have done this type of trading. Much energy and risk being spent. Then I understood that the Holy Grail is not within the systems, but is within us, self-knowledge and self-control.  
Today, I still happens sometimes, even I posted, and I just exhausted.  
Your sincerity is the first step to success.

Does anyone suggests some **initial** plan, for today?  
By "initial" as a starting plan, which may be immediately changed, if the market does not respond as expected.

The chartists figures you propose, I find very interesting, and make me see things I had not yet seen. So I think it's good to share our vision of the market.  
I, today, I'm a little lost, and with vague ideas, even if not published. I will continue studying.  
Thank you for your contribution, which will help us all.

Of course it's great. The more people we are, the more points of view we can share.  
But between you and me, I confess something, I prefer quality to quantity ...

The simplest trades in favor of the trend, usually get the best results.  
The last trade of EURAUD is simply a break in the opening of London, that by our system.

Wow, nice trade! I was waiting this pair to sell upper. Then, I went away, and I forgot to wath it again. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61f.png?v=15.1)

I also want to encourage you, and you can get.  
Meanwhile I'll recommend a little exercise, "a toro pasao" (Analyze after it happens).  
The exercise is that when the day is ending, scrolling through, by eye, price developments and waves. So what you have been looking for the best trades, and point out, paying attention to all the details surrounding these trades (time, volatility, the presence of news, volume changes, position indicators, etc ..) .  
I will give some examples of pairs today. I will seek the trades, around the opening of London. In my opinion, the fresh money is a good reason for trading high probability that get your goals quickly, avoiding fatigue browse more difficult and tense opportunities.  
  
Only I note what points in the London session without comment.  
A good exercise is to extensively discuss these trades, with great detail. Intuition will feed on these exercises, and will progress at a glance.  
So I leave two examples, so you'll understand what I mean. But the work is much higher. You have to analyze everything. Surely you surprised how useful are these exercises.  
  
_PS: With this system work, Aliojin won the title of world champion chess against Capablanca (the machine, the invincible, for so many years). You can believe that trading is easier than chess (because I am a chess player)._

hi Patron, the targert was around the zone you marked. If i can, i like do partial profit and let free another trade with small stop loss, for example below the nearest swing low in this case.  
  
Take notice, the european indexes have closed in green( some of them with nice gains) and sometimes help to move up the us30 Possible new reverse? Possible  
  
on Sunday we have greek elections.

My long trades were closed with losses of -160 pips. Then, I opened shorts that I closed 5 minutes before the weekly close with gains of +100 pips, approx. In summary, this experiment lost, for my style of scalping, -60 pips.

If i can, i like do partial profit and let free another trade with small stop loss, for example below the nearest swing low in this case. Take notice, the european indexes have closed in green( some of them with nice gains) and sometimes help to move up the us30 Possible new reverse? Possible on Sunday we have greek elections. regards

The European indexes ended in green, then much like the reverse pattern formed. However, none of the two signals were sufficient to ensure the opening of trades for long.  
Thinking a little deeper into this, I came to several conclusions.  
First, that the time was not right, that day (Friday) was not adequate, and that the elections in Greece close, not favoring any trade at this point.  
Secondly, I think the US indices influence on other markets, and is more difficult to happen in reverse.  
Furthermore, when this happens, it is a time when the smart money will not risk, unless it have special information that provokes.  
The smart money took profits, and the index dropped. That is normal. They take profits at the end of the day, at the end of the week, and wait to see what happens with Greece.

And if we make a broader technical analysis, we see that the odds of success were even lower, because we were facing a correction greater degree, at least.  
There is a reverse pattern in H1.

I could put a dozen more excuses to classify those trades for long intraday, very low probability. But I think anyone can do now, and understand my message.  
I would add that I do experiments on demo, that the practice of a new system, I do in real small accounts, and confirmed the systems carried out under normal real accounts.  
The practice of a system, once you understand, should always be done in small live accounts, so that the affective component part of trading. In a demo account does not happen, and would acquire bad habits of trading.

I do not know if my previous messages clearly reflects that'm talking about**intraday trading** only.  
At other levels, I have not reviewed this index. Therefore, I do not know if in the**medium term** or **long term** will be bullish, plane, or bearish.

USDJPY H1  
That is an example of using the system at H1.  
  
Market condition is flat, then we wait for Price Action from band.  
  
It can improve the entry going down to lower timeframes.

This is a good idea. I'm getting really stressed with 1M charts. This morning I'm loosing almost 40 pips. I think it's not easy to determine market condition as it is changing all the time. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61f.png?v=15.1)  
  
I'll try again tomorrow....

Lower timeframes are always at the service of higher timeframes. So when we see a setup in lower timeframe, we must check if it is in accordance with Higuer timeframe.

Did you find out where you went wrong? A decision to M1 alone does not work, is otherwise in accordance with M5, at least.

The trade can be profitable. However runs the stoploss quickly covering your entry, as the market allows you, because it is a fifth wave in the same grade. Sometimes the fifth wave can be long, but usually neither is, and we work with probabilities. It's my opinion.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
In addition, the general trend is bearish. And yet we know if a reverse, or correction.

Finally it reach my target. This is a great start for today: EURJPY, 58 pips. Recovering the losses of yesterday....  
  
Thank you for you advice. You have to explain me this counting waves you do. You did in 5m or in bigger TF??

Good trade. Ema233 and bollinger bands showed lateral trend. At the London opening the lateral trend with high liquidity broke, bollinger bands (volatility) were separated and chose to target a pivot.

The waves must be counted within a fractal of the same grade. As metatrader not show fractals but shows timeframes, we could talk about timeframes, to approach the concept.  
In each timeframe we see waves, higher timeframes that we do not. For example on a daily candle do not see waves that followed M15.  
In your chart M15 see the waves that form at that level. A little trick (not accurate) allows you to recognize waves of the same degree, visually comparing them. Thus, waves interconnected by a third, either price or time, waves are likely the same grade. The waves of the same degree are what count.

I don't know if I understood well. Do you mean that 1st and 5th wave usually have the same degree? For me it's difficult to count (I've tryed in the past...) waves, because it seams to me very subjective. In fact, it's really rare to see a clear sequence of five waves. Also I don't know how take it profit of all that.   
  
Anyway, I'll keep my study of the thread. Thank you for helping me.

I think it would help you better than I from here, you to read a book (or via the web) on the Elliot wave, to understand the basic concept.  
The nature of the market is not linear, as is any geometric figure, but is fractal as are many things in nature. Look at the web, and you will understand better.  
In very fluid markets (and FOREX is the most fluid of all), the waves draw price, seem totally random and disordered, however, is not. These waves are the result of the emotions of the human body operating in that market. These waves form patterns (derived from human activity and emotions), leading to impulse waves, or corrective waves ...  
A brief look at the concepts fractality, and the patterns who discovered Elliot, will help you better understand how and why markets with high liquidity move.  
  
That is your homework![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1).

Not only is it difficult for you, counting waves. It is a difficult task even for experts in waves. But the trader need not classify exactly waves. The trader has enough to have a general idea of these issues, and work more clear where things are. The trader looking for high probability trades. That's their job. Those who want to label Elliot waves, beyond them, because it is a huge job.  
Therefore, having a general knowledge is enough, because we have lots of tools related to technical analysis.

It's good to compare TFs. What is uncertain condition at M5, M15 is at lateral condition. Note the slope of the moving averages, and how ema233 is within the bands.

Yes there are many probabilities reverse in that area. Find suitable pattern.

hey guys,  
  
today I was very busy with my day job (actually still I am), so I couldn't allocate much time for trading. but I caught a trade @ GBPAUD which ended well and I want to share it with you.  
  
I was planning to long the pair according to PA at the reaction level I determined before. but the spread widened up to 23 pips(!) with the news and price turned just from that level, so I longed after the spread was normal again. in other words, I missed my entry point about 20 pips, but still managed to get 91. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f64c.png?v=15.1)

USDJPY M5 close long (scalp)  
  
This trade has its origin in a great signal that has given us forexdaist. At first, I was a little reluctant to take this trade because I had my daily quota satisfied, and that the London session was nearing completion.  
However, the possibility of placing a close stop loss and the signal quality have pushed me to carry out trade.  
The signal occurs, as indicated forexdaist at the base of a triangle, which show us the Big Picture.  
In that area trading volume began to increase sharply, indicating two things that are closing shorts and / or that are opening longs. The fact is that it is very easy to imagine, what is the choice of smart money at that point.  
Technically, we have already spoken of the base of the triangle at the Big Picture, to which we add reverse patterns in small timeframes.  
The rest is easy to imagine ...

Friend Sorry I can not help you because I have not been paying attention to the index since last Friday.  
Last Friday I took a look, but both currency pairs where catch good pips, we lack time to watch all ...

this time I saw a bearish bat pattern forming. combined with the signals of our good ORS system, I didn't hesitate one moment to pull the trigger and went directly in profit with no drawdown. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f918.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

hey forexdaist, I came across to your post while reading. I used to count waves with the help of a moving average. you choose an MA (I was using 35 EMA. the higher the number the less waves you'll have or vice versa) and take the highest/lowest points as the wave ends/beginnings. turning from MA or going just above/below the MA and coming back doesn't count. by this way you may get a clearer picture of the market in my opinion. I hope it helps...

Morning ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Dear friends, small little personal problems will keep me away from the thread for a few days.  
I want to thank the contributions do. As the share methods and ideas that enrich us personally and collectively.  
  
Js and I already talked about the harmonics. At the end of the day are merely projections and retractions Fibonacci.  
And I think it's great to use harmonics if you get more confident in your decisions.  
  
The following trades made with charting the base (see forexdaist post [http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...37#post8027837](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=8027837#post8027837)) and within our method (which is to determine the market condition).  
  
If I had used harmonics, the result would have been similar, or maybe I had gotten more pips.  
  
So who like it, feel free to use harmonics, or any tool that helps you make money. But I appreciate that publications were clear, as isengoz,

I have been asked what it is based, exactly this system.  
The purpose of the system is to determine the **market condition**.  
It is based on general knowledge of market behavior.  
  
And we use tools that help us _slow moving average and Bollinger_ and his own moving average.  
  
The arrangement and connection of moving averages with the price, prevent us from out of the market condition, which then analyze multitimeframe.  
  
The perfect trigger for me is the**price action** confirmed by a momentum indicator that provide objectivity.  
  
Ultimately this system allows you to use whatever knowledge you have about the market, but allows you to locate the important points where greater attention, depending on the market condition. In post # 1 There are details of this.  
  
But I'll check if you think I should add something else.  
  
  
Otherwise I intend to create a**friendly atmosphere,** and pleasant work place where we share ideas.

Ok, thank you. This seams to me a very clever and a useful way to count.  
  
By the way of Harmonics patterns, what is the indicator do you use? If you could share it would be great. Do you use as a confirmation tool?  
  
  
thank you

hi forexdaist,   
  
I don't use any indicator for that. Regarding harmonics, if retracements make sense to my eyes I check them with Fibonacci tool, then draw triangles for possible projections, especially on HTFs like H4, D1 or W1. Normally I don't use them very often for such small TFs, as I didn't have a confirmation tool and I got burnt many times for that. But yesterday, ORS rules just clicked with the pattern and this made me feel confident about the trade. Anyway, I have no intention to distract the thread with triangles, rectangles and so on. ORS rules alone are enough to be profitable, I think.

Hey Toni, I think the best way to trade it is that you wait for the price to break either line, then evaluate the situation during the retracement. sooner or later price will break to the upside or downside. currently it doesn't seem to be tradeable to me.  
  
good luck,  
Ish...

There was a short opportunity at 38.2 with target to previous low, but at that time, I thought that was a little risky.

well, that looks like a 7th wave to me which I wouldn't trade. but I still think that we might see a down move as we didn't test last night's news level. I'd like to see the reaction there...

Wow, congrats...! I should stay on that trade, but I allways jump out too early. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f62d.png?v=15.1)  
  
Don't why, I'm allways touching TP's and so, and finally just catch 10-12 pips. Must practice, but I guess my fault today it's psichologic.  
  
  
see you tomorrow

Because the pair is in a heavily uptrend, I didn't want to stay in the trade for too long and quit at the first possible support level. In hindsight, I could have waited till the lower BB or the yellow MA.

So you bought it in acticipation that it could be a wave 5 and should be up... u used the trend line touch as a buy price?

Not only, there were more like :RSI at the bottom, divergence at awesome indi, price action at M1 (double top with confirmation) which all indicate the end of previous wave.  
I admit that it wasn't the best trade because of the news in a minutes, but I did in purpose, because initial stop loss was 16 and tp was about 35, and I already had daily quota fulfilled.. in other words it was just a bonus ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Trade when you can actually learn more is on previous screen (GJ), where now on your MT4 you can see how after C wave, the whole thing starts from the beginning ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/270c-fe0f.png?v=15.1)

Hi there,  
  
Well, I just want to say I haven't reached my 120 pips week target. Too many trades in a week, and some of them really negative and non sense. Overall, I get what I deserved it. I didn't make my homework (those that Patron recommend me...) and I'm doing overtrading once and again.... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f62b.png?v=15.1)  
  
SO, the week ends today. I promess do it better in next one. I post here one of my good trades today. EURJPY, 25 pips.

> Hi there, Well, I just want to say I haven't reached my 120 pips week target. Too many trades in a week, and some of them really negative and non sense. Overall, I get what I deserved it. I didn't make my homework (those that Patron recommend me...) and I'm doing overtrading once and again.... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f62b.png?v=15.1) SO, the week ends today. I promess do it better in next one. I post here one of my good trades today. EURJPY, 25 pips. {image} Any comments are wellcome. See you soon.... TONI

morning j.   
  
I couldn't see 5 waves there, could you elaborate? I was thinking that either it was the beginning of wave 4 of an uptrend, or a small retracement in wave 1 of downtrend continuation (that's why I didn't stayed in the trade for too long). I longed because the m1 divergence had a confluence with the upward trendlines I drew. luckily it hit my TP and returned from there...

I was thinking about your M1 (waves with lower grade). See the pic.  
  
On the HTF I think we are at the beginning of the 5th wave in bearish trend, after zig-zag correction. You can see it on H1.

Yeah, I was watching this also. It use to go up? Do you enter in the BO or wait retracement?

Because it is HTF and I'm usually entering trades on M5 I will wait for retracement after BO.

thanks for the comments and the chart, j. I didn't see those waves to be honest. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) and I agree that the up move was a 3 wave correction.  
  
I shorted the pair after confluence of divergence, trendline and PA on m1, aiming for the next demand level. I quit a bit early but achieved my daily goal with 3 trades and I'm done for the day. no need to be greedy, I think... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60e.png?v=15.1)

It was an usual situation when wave 'e' in triangle gives us a trap like false breakout, and then drops in other direction.  
Planned from the start. Shorted after all 5 waves in confluence with divergence on RSI, awesome and stoch.  
No aggression here IMO ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Nice forexD... If you notice your RSI, it shown you the divergence that says that something gonna happen.. you took the breakout in same direction.. that was nice.

It will test swing high at 179.20-30, after that a retrace is expected. meanwhile a divergence on RSI on 1H is underway.. look at those level for a potentail short setup.

Yes, hit that zone.  
  
Looking at upmove, feel scary to go short.

I think Shantala not be angry if I publish his private message here because there is nothing personal. And I think it is of great interest to the thread.

I have to say totally approve your search intraday wave impulse and I myself relate my momentum indicators very similar to the way that you do so.  
I've always said that the basic knowledge of the formation of waves is of great help to the trader without label exactly as an expert in Elliot waves.

But sometimes, a new fractal grades are mixed, and in those situations, the oscillators do not behave well. That's when market knowledge by the trader must prevail. It is when the trader is asked what the market condition at a given grade.  
The system is, in a simple, rudimentary show is market condition. And the system advised to seek the setup, under that condition.  
One of the possible setups is to go against the trend, which are the Shantala describes in his attempt to capture an intraday trend, since its inception. This type of setup are very profitable and stoploss should always be very close.  
When I have time, I'll include some of your detailed in this type of setup, in post # 1 examples.

yeah, it was. actually, I was planning to long after the lower trendline was crossed and closed above. when I went to grab a coffee price just striked up. luckily it came back to test the upper trend line and also the bollinger mid-line. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) otherwise, I would still be looking for another setup.

For me share with **diligent** people, is one of the purposes of this thread.  
I myself propose or ask, sometimes, if anyone has any **plan** , because I think it is good for the trader. A trader should always have a plan that will change as market responses.  
  
My purpose, beyond the system, people join in a _friendly environment_ where we we **motivate** each other.  
Some days I look at the market and see nothing but the comment from one of my colleagues, either wakes me or motivates me. And that's very nice.  
  
We are here _to make money_. This is a **business**. And in times of liquidity, we prefer to take things **seriously**. There will be time to joke or laugh. There is _time for everything._  
  
Hope you like the plan. If not, I can not encourage you to post here.

You and I commit similar mistakes. In this case, do not let profits run. When I find myself in the situation where you were in this trade, ie more than an open position, always I want to run, at least one trade, but do not always succeed.  
I always tell myself that if I smell a possible major trend, I'll leave an open trade, and run the stop loss, until the price touches the stop loss. I get it rarely, or not doing well. Maybe it's because I am a scalper, but I always find some excuse to close my trades too early.  
I'll keep trying.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1)

Given the economic calendar this morning probably do scalping, within the ranges established there now. At the moment I can not think of anything better this morning, unless the pairs decide to shoot and continue their dominant trends.

I do not usually do trading with the pairs of CAD, but it may be interesting to study, facing the battery news for the American session.

Morning.  
  
Today we will be facing strong news on USD, therefore time before release will probably be sleepy.

For example, I might look long, at some level fibo.

I have the same plan as you. Correction looks something like zig-zag. For sure it's after 5 waves up.  
Same situation is on EJ, GJ and EU.

The flip side is that in the absence of liquidity, currency pairs corrected more than expected, or even change direction. So it is best to be very cautious, and not try to guess the direction but follow.

I am short at GJ, but for scalping, with stoploss very near, and reaction very hard.  
  
  
But I can not advise this kind of trades, because they are not safe, if you can not react well.  
And because, until the contrary is proved, this pair remains bullish.

Yes it is hard to know. So we have to find a good pattern to be born in the right area.

hi guys...  
  
I was looking at the charts and I wanted to share my view on GBPAUD for the next week...  
  
First, weekly chart. Last week buyers tested a previous support that turned into resistance 3 times. Being unable to pass this level, the weekly candle ended like a spinning top and a possible evening star pattern. Other factors that make me think that the price will return from this level is the RSI and Stoch divergences (although not completed) and the fact that we are on the 5th wave of an up move.

Looking at the H1 chart, I see that price is compressed upwards forming an ascending triangle. And when I looked at the RSI, at each attempt buyers made to break the resistance level, the move was loosing strength. Although, I'm not good at reading the volume, the quantity at the 3rd attempt was less then the previous two attempts, which means that the buyers are not interested to move the price further than this level. In the light of these, I expect a final attempt to test the resistance level then a fall breaking the triangle downwards.

So, I expect a bearish move, but down to which level? Then I look at higher lows on the left. Previous 2 HLs are tested once and acted as support. But the 3rd HL was not tested. It looks like a good level on H4, too.

Thanks for sharing.  
  
I don't trade GA because of heavy spread, but I will try to share my point of view.  
We need to remember that ascending triangle is a bullish formation, therefore I would wait for another confirmation such as triple top formation to go short. So significant level will be at line I drew, where you can see probable end of 'e' wave IMO. If price will bounce from that level, price should break ascending triangle also and go further north. If not price should go south as you said. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

It is wise. But sometimes, you can do trading on the news, if you have very clear. How long I will explain better.

morning guys...  
  
Early in the morning, I shorted GBPAUD as I planned. Now that the weekly gap is closed I took my stop to BE+1. It's a free trade now. I'm up about +75 pips at the moment. Let's hope it doesn't come back all the way up ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f64f.png?v=15.1)

To me, I'm like js, I do not trading with GBPAUD, due to my condition scalper and the high spread of the currency pair. But I admire that kind of trades, I am only able to do if I'm not at the computer, I'm always looking for excuses to close.

Hey, I've been away for some time because of a damned flu. Just it's the first day I'm out of bed. Beginning to see the light.... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
This is my trade in the same direction but closed it too early (as usual...) Well I grabbed 15 pips, its not bad. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

I'm also still in a buy trade with GBPAUD (95.36), but maybe I should close it yet because it's coming down right now.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61f.png?v=15.1) Let's see how it reacts to NY open.

USDJPY H4  
  
In the chart, I noted two goals, intermediate one and a higher one.  
We are at a greater correction. But you never know when a correction is over, until it happens, therefore, we can only speculate on likely scenarios.  
  
From my perspective, I think of three major scenarios.  
  
The first scenario is that we are in a fifth wave impulse, and aim at the previous high (red line horizintal)  
  
The second scenario, I think the more likely we are in a complex B form a triangle wave, and therefore, before moving the highest uptrend, would have to go through the C bearish wave.  
  
Third scenario, we have a complex correction, we do not know what will.

It's hard this flu... Yesterday I felt well but today again I'm again weak. Anyway, I'm watching this pairs we use to trade and I'm thinking about buying USDJPY. But I'll wait until retrace gets the downside of this trend channel I see:

If you think it's bullish USDJPY, you can also put a BUY STOP, several pips above the channel, if it tries to escape.  
Beware the flu.

If you look for pattern wave, perhaps, is better at M1.

Yeah, maybe M1. But lately I'm trying to avoid this TF, because it's source of all my bad trades....![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61f.png?v=15.1)  
  
Now I've seen the USDJPY it's gone again to the upside.... Let's wait patiently.

I was also hesitating, because BO from trendline is not enough for me. You can see it on the picture, no trade at the bottom. As I'm trying not to rush my trades I always look for PA like double bottom, 1-2-3 pattern or strong divergence. In this case there wasn't any of this, that's why I was waiting till break of a top to confirm that the trend is on.

All Right. Slowly. I have to talk to you about administracióm of timeframes.  
Remind me, I will try to explain it to be understood.  
  
Take this opportunity to apologize to the participants of this thread. I have difficulties, for personal reasons, to participate in this thread. But I do not want to miss.  
I think ye have joined a large group of traders, and traders say capitalized, attempt the novice, as the oldest, the most practical, or the more theoretical.  
You are a group of good people and you can complement each other in a meaningful way, from the novice to the more experienced.

Js known to look for a substitute **administrator** , because this thread has some of the**best traders in FF** , and I will not separate yourselves.  
  
No need to enter many followers here. People just need**your spiritual category** (no matter they are rookies veterans, the spirit is what counts).  
I assure you, that if you continue in this business, you will succeed in any field of life.  
If any of you feel strong enough to take over as manager ....  
  
I'll be all the time that can support the thread. But right now I can not.  
How to maintain a **formidable group of friends**?  
  
Help me.  
Thank You.

> USDJPY H4 In the chart, I noted two goals, intermediate one and a higher one. We are at a greater correction. But you never know when a correction is over, until it happens, therefore, we can only speculate on likely scenarios. From my perspective, I think of three major scenarios. The first scenario is that we are in a fifth wave impulse, and aim at the previous high (red line horizintal) The second scenario, I think the more likely we are in a complex B form a triangle wave, and therefore, before moving the highest uptrend, would have to go through...

Only these things happen to me when I'm not at the computer and I place the take profits, which sends me right.  
When I'm in front of the screen, I usually lock and unlock operations scalping.

Morning ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Last night, I left several open trades that seemed high probability and easy to read.  
  
USDJPY, EURAUD and AUDUSD  
  
+28+37+22 = +87 PIPS

Dear friends, as I passed yesterday, I think**my work in this thread is over**. For personal reasons, ever do I have less time to attend to.  
  
The aim of this system is to establish the**market condition** , at whatever level (typically, intraday).  
For that, you have to train the eye correlating the bollinger, the sma50, and ema233. Although I think maybe we could _add a shorter moving average_ , which give more intensity to the direction of the price, at any given time.  
  
I do not know if I have achieved my goal. I hope so. I actually do not believe in any system because the market is not systematic. But this _"pseudo-system" is very flexible_ , and allows the trader to use whatever knowledge he possesses within it.  
  
So I have nothing else to say thanks to those you share in this thread. I will try to follow those who remain, and will intervene whenever possible.  
  
If any of you are _interested in managing the thread,_ in order to maintain the spirit of cooperation and motivation to write me a private email, and we will see how to fix it.  
  
Thank You.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Sorry about my absence, I was traveling unexpectedly. However I would like every participant of this thread, to express his opinion what we should do next?  
If you would like to stay here, share ideas etc. If you want some help from me, I'm willing to share![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
Or if Patron won't be here anymore, we're just letting this thread go to cemetery..![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1)  
We are group of fine people and we should decide as a group.

Dear friends, I will not totally disappear. I just can not keep enough to manage the thread often.  
As to let the thread go to the cemetery, or not, it is an easy matter to resolve.  
  
I would make a list of pros and cons of posting here, together with a group, with similar or complementary ideas.  
  
I ask myself:  
What are the _benefits_ of working with a group of friends?  
Regardless of individual experience, or individual styles, the benefit is obvious: **sharing** knowledge and mutual **motivation**.  
Even so provide less experienced traders is good for the group because they bring **freshness** and force experienced to strengthen their arguments, which **clarifies** their own ideas and reinforced.  
  
The other question would be:  
What are the benefits letting the thread falls in the cemetery?  
Walking around, "free", uncompromising, sharing with strangers, you probably will not understand us and influence over us.  
Surely fall motivation.  
  
The fact of needing a **manager** is only to guard the**spirit of the thread.** Here, in principle, could be published throughout the world, provided they do not interfere in that spirit.  
  
Depends on you. Make your lists. Likely to benefit or not. Worth it?  
  
Whatever your decision will be good.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

thanks for your replies, guys.  
  
regarding that cemetery thing, I think the downside of trading is it's an introverted activity. after everything about a method is told and explained (in my opinion which you did well at this point, patron ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) ), people send their trade examples (like we do at the moment) and eventually the interest falls because trading the same patterns, sending the same screenshots all the time is a boring thing actually, and what keeps people sending them is the admiration and appreciation of the others. if newbies are interested in the system, they continuously ask for the same questions without reading the previously written posts and finally they give up as they can't reach success. and the thread goes to the 'cemetery' like other couple of thousand threads. I don't even mention about the ego wars ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) well, I've been a member for about 5 years now, and this is what I have observed reading forum threads.   
  
regarding our good ORS thread, the good and bad side is that we are not a crowded group. both you and J. have been good to me since the beginning and this gave me the motivation I needed to continue posting (the appreciation factor) and thanks for that. because we are just a few traders, I thought it will end the thread when our top contributor said that he won't be around any more. anyway, it's in our hands to continue or not as you said, and I'll try to keep on posting as long as I'm not the only one left behind. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
see you later,  
Ish...

I'm waiting for the price to reach the upper resistance (previous support) line @ 1.55 before thinking of selling it. It is also a good psychological level being a RN.

I'm still waiting for a strong confirmation of my plan.  
However I think that soon correction will appear, because we are at 5th wave right now.

The plan on the GBPUSD, I think the best view. If successful it will give good beneficial.

you might be right. I think even if the pair falls (correction) it will not fall out of this compression pattern. we might see some moves somewhat lateral. surely that's just what I see at the moment. it may change with a news release, or something like that.

hola mi amigo... thanks for your kind words.

Do not forget that US banks are closed today. I do not know to what extent this will influence the plans.

Well, in my opinion, the chances of you correct your mistakes and improved that curve are practically 100%, because you understand the market, so everything is in your hands, which is much or all.

hey J, I was looking at the charts and I noticed that GU is at a daily reaction level at the moment. so my previous expectation about 1.55 may not be valid and we might see a bearish move in my opinion. Also, a bearish engulf is being created on D1.

by the way, what do you recommend for confirmation? I know I act a bit aggressive, but as I add filters to trades it leads to an analysis/paralysis situation.

You are doing great on M1, but because of that also you do trading counter trend often. So in my opinion you should looking more on M5, then look for patterns like double top/bottom, 1-2-3 formations to enter in a favour of the trend. CT are good, but only in ranging market. I think I don't have to tell that counting waves is a must.  
Try to analyze your mistakes from the past and try to find reasons not to enter on M5 at that time.

normally I don't look at my negative trades, as it makes me focus on negative things. I try to focus on positive setups that worked and try to find the same or very similar ones. but you are right, sometimes (if not always) looking back and analysing the mistakes might also be helpful. I think I need to go over my trading plan, too.

ok, last trade of the day. today was more or less a BE day. I misinterpreted some moves and gave away the profit I had. Only 1/3 of my daily target achieved. anyway, it's better than a negative day...

by the way, you might have noticed that I started to close 90% of my profitable trades and let the rest float with stop at BE. well, I have always admired Graeme's millipede method, but because I was trading lower time frames before ORS, my targets were just 10-15 pips and most of the time price turned back after a while. with ORS, I can enter trades at the beginning of the waves and combined with higher time frame's trend, trades would go much further then my targets. so I decided to trade for 1:1 R:R (actually it is 1:1.1 as I close 90%) and let the remaining ones create a millipede. My daily target is 3 fully profitable trades, so if I reach my target every day that may mean 3 feet daily. For now the remaining ones might be micro lots but if I can consistently increase my balance, they will become larger positions and will act like my assurance in the near future. At least, this is what I think at the moment. I may send my floating positions from time to time. at the moment the situation is like this...

Of course it's better than negative day.  
I have only 1/2 of my daily target. I didn't see any cherry to pick during NY session.  
It is also because when I've turned live I became too conservative, I guess I need some time![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Thanks isengoz.  
I have a follow-up question, what if my friend earned a lot of money on this corrupted data. Will they take this money back?

if you think logically they will not, as no such thing happened in real world. most probably they have provisions about such situations in their terms of service agreement. but you may try to withdraw money. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Hi all,  
  
Let's going on with the thread. I think it's very helpful to many of us, and also for anyone who are interested in PA methods.  
  
This is my last trade. EURJPY 32 pips.

I think I could also have took EURUSD and USDJPY, but well, I'm trying to be very selective. Less trades, more confidence... Let's see.

These are my plans for the**EURJPY** , depending on whether it has already peaked or more peaks.  
I think there is likely a type retracemente wave 4, to later continue the uptrend (within a larger correction), to 38% fibo we see in the daily chart.  
  
PS. Naturally, I'm no fortuneteller, and this is only a general plan to guide me. Depending on market responses, I will adapt and even change my plan.

good morning J.   
  
about GJ, I might have ended up on BE, too, if the price didn't make a lower low and a lower high after my entry. when I saw that I decided to wait for a retracement without moving the stop to BE, and luckily it worked.

I've seen that too. However I was a little bit afraid of news release. Like I said earlier, when I turned live I became too conservative. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f937-200d-2642-fe0f.png?v=15.1)

there is nothing wrong about being conservative, in my opinion. if your style works well during the day, you have plenty of time to make profits. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Hello friends,  
  
Here's a brief scalp in GBPJPY. Maybe I should stay a bit more in the trade. Well, 14 pips into account it's not bad. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f64c.png?v=15.1)

> These are my plans for the EURJPY, depending on whether it has already peaked or more peaks. I think there is likely a type retracemente wave 4, to later continue the uptrend (within a larger correction), to 38% fibo we see in the daily chart. PS. Naturally, I'm no fortuneteller, and this is only a general plan to guide me. Depending on market responses, I will adapt and even change my plan. {image} {image}

EURJPY Daily  
  
I established a scenario where EJ reached 38% fibo directly in retracement daily. This did not happen, but down three waves of the same degree. That makes me think that probably still have a bullish wave more, to complete the correction of higher degree.  
I always repeat that corrections can not be read until it is finished. But at least I have a plan, which will vary depending on market movements.

I think you're right.  
It's not an excuse, but it was calculating the EURUSD and EURJPY tragets for, and had also reached my quota.

I'll wait for a retracement to the purple zone for re-entry and try to long on M1 if possible; otherwise I'll wait for it to reach the supply level I mentioned...

wow, this happened too fast that I couldn't enter on time. but my projection was right that the price turned just a few pips away from the 138 level in the supply zone.

It's true ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) Trade was based only on divergence at double bottom and 5th wave. With no further confirmation.  
  
I was treating it as a possible bonus from AUD news only.

I think I must clear up my mind about this strategy. I'm vey impulsive and sometimes don't analyse the whole situation properly. I need a clear trading plan. Less noise, more clearless.

hi patron  
  
when I look at NZDUSD I see that price just tested a previous support that turned into a resistance, and the reaction was good that it created an engulf, but not good enough to create a new lower low. now I expect the buyers to test that level again, and furthermore the level I indicated with blue circle. it is a level which contains many confluences. I expect a big move between 0.765x - 0.766x. a mid term short may be considered with stops above the supply zone till 0.722x. a very good R:R in my opinion. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Is it possible scenario that you propose.  
But the engulfing already was valid and won 35 or 40 pips.  
I'm not saying to go short immediately, but I think that if an entry intraday short is confirms it then have a good chance of success.  
According ORS, at H4, market condition seems to lateral. The engulfing occurs at the level of the upper Bollinger band, then I think chances are good looking shorts trades. Now need the price action that has not yet occurred in intraday.  
That is, I am agree that your scenario may occur, but, for me, has more chances, if the action price comes, seeking shorts trades.  
  
That's what we're here to share opinions and argue them. Thanks isengoz.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

yep, I saw that 5th wave, too. but because I didn't see a new lower low and price retraced just 50% of the last move I assumed that the 5th wave may not be over and that might be a retracement that occurred at a critical level. surely because we talk about H4, any move is about or over 30-40 pips, so they are good to trade. I'm talking about trading like an elephant (big waves and large pips, more time) ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) however it is also possible to trade like a cheetah or something like that (fast in fast out) ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

NZDJPY H4  
  
I fully understand your argument, and, as I said, is a likely scenario. But for my style of trading, it is difficult to search for trade longs, and it is easier, for me, in this situation, wait and look for shorts trades.

NZDUSD M15  
  
NU has receded 50% from the previous wave.  
Probably, I will wait up to 62%, where there was much trading volume (resistance) to see what happens at that level.

That is a very bad trade, because after 5 vawes same degree need, at least, retracement, and it is a upper band. For long, need retracement and confirmation.

USDJPY  
Congratulations for your trade.  
You have made a very aggressive first entry, based in the waves and indicators (like what js made in a prior trade). Then you have made a second entry, safer based on Price Action and break the trend line, with an objective that I failed to see at the time.

USDJPY daily  
  
My assessment of Big Picture for this currency pair is similar to the EURUSD but inverted way. So I think it will be bearish. We will have to investigate smaller timeframes.

USDJPY H4-H1  
  
According to our system "Off Road System" (ORS), the h1 and h4 timeframes show a sideways market condition.  
Therefore, I will save savages ruptures at those levels, it should be easy to follow the waves of this currency pair.

hi guys...  
  
I can't write and trade too much these days as I am very busy with other matters. this morning I had some limited time to trade and decided to focus on GBPJPY. with the help of the ORS, PA, S/D, harmonics and some fibos I think I leaped into a new dimension... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60e.png?v=15.1)

Morning. In my opinion, I think we could find shorts for this currency pair.

I think it's fair to value the good things. Readers should look very closely at your posts and seriously study them. I do. Even I look higher timeframes within your trades. I enjoy it.

I really liked this series of trades, too.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
I can not post anything lately because I'm short time at the computer, and the few trades I make, are not good examples, because it is a very fast scalping, almost intuitive and very personal, and very difficult to transfer to a post with explanations.

Sometimes we read there cries of despair, trying to alleviate his own **frustration** against Universe conspires against them. That frustration and lack of maturity is typical of an immature teenager, but not a trader.  
  
A**trader is responsible** for any of their actions. Luck does not exist. The conspiracies do not exist. There is only a world of **probabilities** , that the trader must manage in the best way possible.

Take this opportunity to point out a **trap** common market, which may result in other timeframes.  
We call it trap but to my way of reading the market, I think it is quite logical when viewed from another perspective.  
The market always moves seeking **liquidity**. We interpret it as that puts us traps and _hunting our stoploss and our pending orders_.  
But if our eyes got used to count and read the volumes waves, we can avoid those traps or at least not trust those movements.

hey patron, how you doing? sorry for not being around. I am traveling this week, so I don't have time to trade. hopefully I will be back next week.  
  
I just wanted to show you my larger time frame view on GJ. I think the pair has a room of about 800 pips to the downside according to the bullish gartley forming. from the elliot perspective it might have come to the end of the 2nd wave and started the 3rd wave, too. so I would look for shorts and take opportunities to short on retracements on lower time frames.  
  
the target level has also some historical value when looked left. and also the yellow moving average and lower bollinger bands would agree when (and if) the price reaches there...

GBPJPY M15  
  
In my opinion, GJ, which is bearish as indicated eisengoz ([http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...31#post8130631](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=8130631#post8130631)) is preparing a bullish retracement. Based on bearish waves greater (5), and the momentum in different timeframes.  
It can be risky to take long, with the price action?

Perhaps it is better to pay attention to other currency pairs. But I have not had time to prepare any ...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1)  
  
So far, I have only made very short scalping on GJ, collecting about 10 pips.

The very belief that the pair GJ was facing a probable correction greater degree, has made me lose the opportunity to earn some good pips on short trades.  
It was easy to follow **system**(Market condition: bearish, and breakdown). Sometimes these things happen and remind us that the concept of **discipline** there.

morning everyone...  
  
I was planning to long the pair from the level I determined (you can see that at the bottom of the chart in my previous post), but the price turned just a couple of pips above that so I didn't open any trades. on the other hand, the new low (rectangle in the chart) deceived me that the bearish move would continue, so I opened 2 more shorts but they got stopped out in a short time. with the new high I now think that a correction has begun. I have 2 levels to short the pair. I would long it 'till those levels but I am still travelling, so I don't have time to watch the charts. anyway I closed my other trades as well for a total of 186 pips including the two positions that got stopped out. the result is worse than 500, but better than nothing ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Morning  
  
EURAUD H1  
  
Yes, it seems to start a good correction. Perhaps the next hour candle give us more clues.  
  
But ema233 is too far for a normal reverse (H1), Then, the goal could be the upper Bollinger band (H1).

Lately, I've made several errors in reading the Big Picture. Nothing happens. That did not make me lose money, because I only open positions based on technical analysis intraday, and always with stop loss.  
I admit my mistakes in trying to learn from them. Most of these errors are psychological, where I miss my own rules. But I have clear, very clear**not let losses run never** , but then the price will go back to my favor. This attitude allows me to control **fear**(emotion).  
  
This gives me **confidence** because I know I have **opportunities** every day.

Ok Patron. Don't you think there's still some room for sell in GBPJPY? I think it could go south untill 176.20 or so.

I do not know.  
By the form and type of waves, I'd say it's **probably** a _new high at this level_ , then down again.  
  
You know that in this business _nothing is certain,_ and only**speculate with probabilities and risk control, after analysis.**

My **prejudices** about currency pairs GBPXXX, have not allowed me to make good trades this morning.  
It is the second time it happens this week something similar (I do**not follow the system)**.  
I've only gained about +15 pips when GBPJPY was in range M1 timeframe by _scalping fast_ I do not usually post.

Of course, to reach 176.20, need more than one day, if we stick to ADR.

hi guys,   
  
I started to like this pair ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

After +155 pips of profit from longs, I shorted the pair for another +100 pips...  
  
I don't post the longs as they were breakout trades, not ORS ones... By the way, price reached to level I mention in one of my previous posts (#926). Now I would think of shorting it again for new lows...

Beyond the **systematic** trading, we find the **discretionary** trading.  
In discretionary trading, **intuition** starring a very important role. Therefore, this type of trading is only suitable for very **experienced** traders.  
  
In this thread we have already seen some examples of how this type of trading, featuring isengoz and js.  
  
The ORS born in an attempt to establish the condition of the market at a given level (usually intraday) and get a guide to work from attending to technical analysis in general. However, I appreciate any solution to make us earn money, in a simple way.  
  
I get the impression that the latter provision of isengoz, form part of discretionary trading.  
The experience makes him intuit that the currency pair needs liquidity, and this sees through the momentum, and support and resistance, and the path of the wave, and harmonics.  
Even still gives you more confidence knowing you are in a correction against the major trend, and that the price will not go up too many pips without hesitation and without seeking liquidity (food markets). Intuition does not need shelling all. She knows.  
  
I can not recommend this type of trading for newbies, but it's good to know there. Thousands of flight hours are needed to fly well.  
  
Isengoz, thanks for your contribution and congratulations on your positive pips.

hi toni, thanks for your reply. actually such entries are not that difficult. I try to show every factor behind my trades. for example, on this one:  
  
\- the price made a new low and retraced back. that showed me that price would continue to fall.   
\- there was a supply level (blue line) confluencing with RN (50 level), BB upper line, some fibo (88.6% of the last down move), PA divergence with RSI. so it didn't take much time to judge the position from my point of view.  
\- and exit was the demand level confluencing with another RN (00 level)   
  
as you see the steps are not that difficult. the thing is you should concentrate on the pair's moves and keep the bigger picture in mind. the rest will come with practice...  
  
bye for now...

another 100+ pips from multiple positions. when I closed the trades I felt like I left a lot on the table, but I didn't like the divergence on RSI. I may re-enter if the price retraces back. my target was the blue line on top...

it's been very quiet here today...  
  
I just want to share what I learned from the day. in the morning I saw that the price retraced back all the way down to the base of the last upwave. so I opened long positions with the expectation that it will go higher before returning back to its bearish HTF trend. I was right and I went up till 500+ pips on 5 positions. everything was okay till then. however, my target was about 40 pips above and I was blinded with that. I saw the price screaming that it will come down at 1.40 but disregarded that. when it started falling I considered that it was a retracement, then opened 2 more positions. in the end, ended the day at break even. From 0 to 500 then back to 0. anyway, the lesson learnt. I should never ignore the PA and signals I get from it, and should never let overconfidence rule my decisions.   
  
here is the chart of those trades...

Indeed, I remember that message on the harmonic probability of GBPJPY.  
I appreciate your contributions. Unfortunately, at my age, I can read English, but it is very difficult to understand by the sound, and I can not share those files. However, surely there will be many people who can take good advantage of the link.

It seems to me well where you closed positions. Perhaps, having four open trades, flush one until exhaustion.

well, actually I thought about that at the weekend. that day, thinking that I have left half of the profit on the table affected my decisions later on. the next day which ended up at BE, I didn't intervene my trades keeping in mind the profit I missed the day before. and I have lost all my profit then. so there is no perfect way of doing that. I decided to follow my plan, if I leave some profit on the table no problem. it doesn't matter as long as I'm not in deficit. like the trades I completed this morning... I got about 110 pips, but it won't affect me as long as I'm in profit...   
  
here is the chart...  
  
M1 EURAUD +110 pips

by the way, just a quick note that I've been doing some experiments about the way I trade for the last 20 days. for that reason, I was trading with the minimum lot size possible, and now that I'm satisfied with my entries and exits I decided to implement my money management to my trades. That means my trades may not have as much pips as I had for the last couple of weeks. and also I may show the improvement in my account with graphs at weekends.

> by the way, just a quick note that I've been doing some experiments about the way I trade for the last 20 days. for that reason, I was trading with the minimum lot size possible, and now that I'm satisfied with my entries and exits I decided to implement my money management to my trades. That means my trades may not have as much pips as I had for the last couple of weeks. and also I may show the improvement in my account with graphs at weekends.

Since then, the number of pips is not important, but _capital and risk management_. The important thing is to get **confidence** that leads you to be a **consistent** trader, and I think you you are, or know how to be.

congrats on your pips patron...  
  
just a comment on your trade... I always ask myself that how I could enter a trade earlier. here the level price turned from was at the confluence of a couple of factors:  
\- it was at a previous resistance that turned into a support  
\- it was a daily pivot (the dashed line)  
\- it was at a fibo level of the last wave (38.2)  
\- there was a solid demand level (by solid I mean created with a huge engulf)  
\- price left that demand level with another engulf and it was the first visit.  
surely your entry was after a confirmation (trend line) and that's safer than what I will tell. but, I would consider entering at the beginning of the 2nd bullish candle (which could give me about 5 pips more) and my 2nd or 3rd entry would be at your level. and I would exit at your level, too. it was a good level to exit, I think.

Yes I've considered, but the _correlation of currency pairs_ (EU, GJ), did not give me **confidence**... Then I hesitated, until confirmation.  
  
This does not mean that the correlation was bad, but I have not seen it **clear**.

I have to confess that I also seek such entries where many confluences and positive factors. But there was a time when I made numerous mistakes in that sense, and I swore I always _wait for confirmation._  
So my previous post must be added a **psychological** factor, the fear that made me _lose confidence_ , I still knew rationally that the chances were almost 100%.

Beyond the _technique_. The hardest thing for me was and still is the _psychological_ aspect of trading.  
It took me a while to realize that the perfect trade, clashed a lot with my fears and my confidence. So I decided to find a way of trading according to my **personality** , even if not perfect trades. Therefore, unless there is either inspired me, you will see in my trades, I seek confirmations, and I close soon.  
  
I have learned to know in this work, and I am a person who does not hold much **pressure** , so although it seems contradictory, I do scalping, so that the trades last a short time.  
My main **enemies** are fear and loss of confidence, and I think I found a way, through timely capital management and risk not stay long with open positions.

All this does not remove the reason to your post where you promote early entry. On the contrary, it has been a **great** detail for the thread.  
And I've only taken the opportunity, not to criticize, but to let me know a bit more myself.  
But my challenge is to overcome these obstacles.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

I have been looking for signals to short EURAUD and I shorted it several times. but because we are so close to the ADR level and the price resists to go down I chickened out and closed my 4 positions at about 30 pips. today, not loosing what I earned became more important than being right.  
  
M5 EURAUD +30 pips (entries were on M1)

Perhaps the trendlines less important here, in favor of some pattern or support and resistance. (?)

EURAUD M5  
  
If we use the template of Sonic, it seems prudent to wait until the price is above the dragon, if we believe the currency pair will make a wave upward.

EUERAUD M1  
  
With the template of ORS, it is prudent, if we take long, wait until the price is above the 233 EMA, at M1.

EURAUD M1  
  
Well, I have to stop here. Perhaps a triangle is formed in EA. We Will See ...  
It is clear that the lack of divergence in the first double bottom was a sign that he has broken the trendlines, in favor of other figures.

EURAUD M1  
  
At first, he was willing to look long. But then I realized that the price weighed increasingly ...  
The price is 1.40 resisted, but finally broke. I close my shorts in the 50% fibo.  
Perhaps the price down further. But it's my style, and I can hardly get out of it.  
Quota duplicated. I'm satisfied. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

I see that we are about to break the flag on EURAUD. I might have closed my trades too early. anyway, if we break it we'll resume our higher timeframe downtrend I guess. then my projection is between 1.35 - 1.34. let's see what happens next...

on the other hand, if we go up we might be in an ascending triangle formation, which means yesterday's low is the key point today in my humble opinion...

EURAUD H1  
  
Too much volume on the pin. To me, if there is a break, we should confirm by price action below the trendline, at minors timeframes.

you were right patron. I had to leave my computer, so I assumed the fall would continue. my call was way too early and deceiving, sorry about that. anyway when I came back I re-assessed the situation and opened 3 positions which ended up in +120 pips. I had 2 losses which cost me about 35 pips. anyway, I end up my day doubling my daily target.   
  
here are the winners...  
  
M1 EURAUD +120 pips

by the way, on Monday I had told that I was going to trade according to my money management plan from this week on. well, this week was very successful from my point of view, I had some difficulties about the psychology at the beginning of the week though. with time I'm sure I'll improve the results. here is the balance chart for this week...

Glad to see you too. I'm good, but I missed the thread so I decided to come back.   
During my absence I had quite a long time with very good performance, however I have some problems with psychology lately. I hope that it's just a matter of a moment.

Lately, health is not with me as I wanted, so I had to reduce the number of hours in front of the screen. Also I have noticed that, in general, just be aware a couple of hours after London for acceptable quota.

EURJPY M1  
  
I have tried the market **condition** as a **lateral**. Perhaps the _final wave_ should treat it as _bullish_ , but my quota is satisfied, and no need to risk.

This is WOW. I have no clue for lateral conditions yet. Any advice? I've noticed that there is no HH orr LL, so I known that it will be lateral but what next? I see that you trading in bands, using divergences, am I missing something?  
  
EDIT: Of course in this case were also fibo 50 in confluence with "flip" support and daily pivot. Lack of those things was the reason why you didn't trade in a same way on GJ?

Good Morning.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
We can never know first if the conditions are going to be lateral or impulse (actually, yes can be intuited). I just said I _tried_ the trades**as if** they were for a lateral condition.  
  
Regarding GJ, I do not analyzed. Yesterday I was late to the "party" and only I noticed EJ, because you mostrate your trade, which made me pay attention, or that's one of the things I like the thread.

Some observations:  
  
EA: Double top on tf M15 (but in front of daily pivot).  
GJ: 1-2-3 pattern on tf M15  
GU: 1-2-3 pattern on tf M5

The problem with the EA is that it could also be a flat correction, and continue to rise. It's the only thing to keep in mind, I think.  
  
Perhaps it is prudent one SELL STOP beyond the daily pivot, or alarm beyond the pivot, to treat the pair then as bearish or corrective.

Might be. But we have also dynamic resistance on H4 with us right now.

EJ and GJ  
It is very interesting resemblance between the two currency pairs, although at different times.  
The waves, the price behavior, the behavior of moving averages, all very similar.

Trading at M1.  
  
We must be clear that this business is a business based on **probabilities**.  
  
Therefore, there are _no certainties_ , and hence it is essential to use **Stoploss**.  
  
The most important thing in trading is _capital management and risk management._ These issues are not addressed in this thread, but you can find plenty of stuff out there, but in the end, the use of common sense disciplined, is more than enough for my purposes. While it seems much more professional to use a spreadsheet for your leverage, according to your risk appetite.  
The only certainty we can say mathematically to open a trade is the amount we can lose.  
  
I publish many charts in M1 timeframe. However my decisions are based on higher time frames H1, M15, M5 ... I mean I compose a **plan** from _multitimeframe analysis_.  
Finally if the _technical analysis_ in tune with the general plan, I get trades with high probabiidades success. Then I calculate the risk, and go into operation.  
  
To open my trades, normally, I'll M1 timeframe, in an attempt to refine my posts as possible. Why? Because I'm a scalper and seeking intraday trades, whether in **range**(wide enough) or in small emerging **trends** in times of **liquidity**(new session or news). But I never forget noticing M5 and M15, which are for me the most important timeframes for intraday trading.  
  
The rest is a matter of _technique_. At first post, I proposed a _template_ for guideline, so it easy to interpret. But each must use those tools best known, and which becomes more comfortable.

_Trending or ranging?_  
  
How can we know if the price will start an intraday **trend** or a movement **range**?  
  
We _can not k_ now for sure, but we can guess the odds, if we are aware of the nature of the market and how it behaves daily.  
  
So we can see the volume, analyze the wave _, see the importance_ of support or resistance, see the economic calendar, see what time of the session are, what day are we, relations between currency pairs, the behavior of our favorite indicators The behavior of the moving averages.  
Maybe I leave me some things in the pipeline, but this whole set of things are what our eye gets used to evaluate.  
  
The best method of learning, for me, is the most classic, which consists of many hours of **backtesting** , taking in every detail. Eventually enough to recognize many patterns that put us on guard and warn us about the condition of market confidence is obtained.

Template eventual change (Added template Sonic).  
We could try long, above the dragon, if PA...  
  
For now, I would consider this as Lateral Market, due to proximity, shape and location of the moving averages with respect to the price. and count the waves ...  
  
Volumes in principle indicate that the bulls are shopping until the contrary is proved. So I see it.

Correct. Rupture of support. Even a few minutes before you could see that the dollar was stronger if you look at UJ ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

> **Trending or ranging**? How can we know if the price will start an intraday trend or a movement range? We can not know for sure, but we can guess the odds, if we are aware of the nature of the market and how it behaves daily. So we can see the volume, analyze the wave, see the importance of support or resistance, see the economic calendar, see what time of the session are, what day are we, relations between currency pairs, the behavior of our favorite indicators The behavior of the moving averages. Maybe I leave me some things in the pipeline,...

Sometimes we can guess discretion that can form an intraday trend, but do not know. And then propose treat trade like lateral, doing **partial** closures, and always leaving a percentage of open trades, to finish the "trend".

Also, I think it's a good idea to accustom the **eye** to monitor the **volumes** , because we can always warn that something important will happen.

EA +53  
  
First trade was from M15 1-2-3 pattern. Channel handled the price what caused a little drawdown.  
Second trade from M1 (bollinger band, oscillator sold out) according to the prior direction.  
  
Exited on channel.

Congratulations for the pips. But I would treat this market with more caution. I treat it like lateral M5. It's my opinion.  
Moving averages are not arranged neatly at M5.

I agree. That's why I chose to exit and not waiting for more waves up.

GU M5  
Yes, I expect a reversal in GU and GJ. In a large percentage of cases, when the latter is a very fast waveform, it behaves **like a gap.**

This trade was made with intuitive _discretionary criteria_ with _close stoploss and a nice profit / loss ratio._

Good trade. It is quite common for EMA233, join other signals as resistance.

After three highest in the same degree, joined other signals to determine the need for **liquidity** , and took advantage of the retracement. Well done.  
I miss using **_volumes_** as signals ...

Maybe it's time to rest and **analyze** all day. It's a good learning method. To me, I served.  
You have to look at all possible trades, in every detail, even in the currency pairs that have not worked.

I do not know if this is the case. But keep in mind that after 5 waves at a _given leve_ l, it is not mandatory that the price starts a trend toward the opposite side. Sometimes those 5 waves up a**greater degree** and wave becomes a # 1 wave. So just might expect a decline (wave 2 or wave B), and the price would continue to rise to a greater degree.

Agree, but price was at level when first wave with bigger degree ended, so it was the best place to try. Of course it was in agreement of PA on M1. Trade has been separated into halves. One half in agreement with M1 ended up with +29, the other half which was attempt to 5 wave with bigger degree ended up with BE.

EURAUD **Daily**  
  
If we go to the daily chart, it seems important to see how it will end today's candle as it could pass a major reverse **Fibo**(38%), and an important _round number_ (1.4200).  
  
If prices continue to rise, the next most logical target would be beyond 1.4300 where two reversals Fibo (38 and 50%) and a trend line drawn on the chart as a yellow zone.  
  
We'll see what happens. Any comments are welcome and respected.

In my opinion might be 5th wave on EA.  
EJ still no direction - lateral. Same on GU.  
GJ made 5 waves on M5 and M15 so might be a correction next.

Thank you for your feedback. I'm still waking up with coffee.  
The only thing that has struck me so far is the rapid fall of EURAUD, I usually try as a false GAP.  
EA has fallen by 38% of the primary wave. We'll see what happens, because sometimes even not respect its midrange.

EURUSD  
  
I had a bit of luck, studying EURJPY, EURUSD took me in rank. In the London session is usually good breaks (high probability). Then, as the pair was still "virgin" took the classic break, which always brings good pips.

Morning  
  
Yesterday I was reviewing my trading and I've noticed that I stopped using trend lines on small TFs.

Good morning. This is the **spirit**. From a general rule, one should **create** their own trading, depending on your **personality** , looking at those details or signs that make you feel more **comfortable**.

actually I'm expecting it to go down till 1.4790 before going up. but that amount of pips was enough for me, so I quit a bit early today. my quota is filled... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

GBPUSD M5-M15  
  
GBPUSD was **lateral** , and came from an intraday _downtrend_.  
  
As we know from many examples, the London opening has great probabilities to generate **ruptures** , due to the entry of new money (**liquidity**).  
  
So this is another case of London break.

hi guys...  
  
I just wanted to share a missed opportunity with you. Last night when markets opened, I checked some charts and AUDUSD looked good to go down further. I placed a pending sell order at .76782, then about a minute later I decided to cancel it due to some bad experiences about Asian session in the past. I was thinking of risking about 10 pips for ~90 pips. anyway, this is what I found when I woke up. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f624.png?v=15.1)

this is not an ORS trade attempt, but as I said I just wanted to share it. I hope this doesn't affect my intraday decisions.

> hi guys... I just wanted to share a missed opportunity with you. Last night when markets opened, I checked some charts and AUDUSD looked good to go down further. I placed a pending sell order at .76782, then about a minute later I decided to cancel it due to some bad experiences about Asian session in the past. I was thinking of risking about 10 pips for ~90 pips. anyway, this is what I found when I woke up. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f624.png?v=15.1) {image} this is not an ORS trade attempt, but as I said I just wanted to share it. I hope this doesn't affect my intraday decisions....

Good morning. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Hello **isengoz**. It's a shame that you will not take that trade.  
You remembered some bad experiences in the Asian session and get discouraged. Maybe if you had written across the advantages of trade, the'd done.  
  
For example:  
-The beginning of the week are different,  
-No major news expected,  
-The**ratio 1: 9** only need 2 or 3 hits to **win**...  
  
Maybe once you've already thought of this, but I wanted to exploit the situation to record in the thread, you always have to shuffle the maximum of situations and their probabilities.  
  
I also take this opportunity to recall that, for me, ORS is very flexible and only requires that, by any technique, we can recognize the _market condition._

EURAUD H1  
  
That depends on how we look and count the waves.  
If the reversal is consolidated, there are several objectives. I, for now I have placed a Fibonacci.

EURUSD M5  
  
I also pay attention to this pair of currencies, even made a small scalping (14 pips). But I found it easier formation EURAUD, and focused on it.

with these I doubled my daily target. I thought trades would be closed by the news time, so it was a tense wait while I was in drawdown.

In general, my view is the technical anális top timeframe. I try not to operate around the turn of the session. Unless you set pending orders in favor of my analysis, but be careful hunters pending orders.  
Today I had placed the order for the EURAUD. And for the EURUSD, I've hunted the flight because the pair has not moved its spread too.  
It would have been difficult to catch the flight EURAUD, because the spread has increased a lot.  
Anyway I believed in my analysis and I have been able to operate with many odds in favor.

Unless you set pending orders in favor of my analysis, but be careful hunters pending orders. Today I had placed the order for the EURAUD. And for the EURUSD, I've hunted the flight because the pair has not moved its spread too. It would have been difficult to catch the flight EURAUD, because the spread has increased a lot. Anyway I believed in my analysis and I have been able to operate with many odds in favor.

In short, it's a matter of accepting the market condition and put through, technical analysis, the odds favor, and immediately close the trades if error ... In the long run you win.

Izengoz, I hope I have answered your question, otherwise we can continue talking about it .. The experience is also very useful as it gives rise to that higher intuition, this is the first sign.  
Then I check that it is technically feasible, and finally comes the decision ....

well, actually I was asking about the trendline/pattern (i.e. ascending/descending triangles) brekaouts. maybe J. could answer this as most of his trades are taken when the price breaks a trendline or S/R level.  
  
if I take a trade as soon as the trendline breaks it sometimes turns out to be a fake spike, if I wait for the candle to close out of the pattern then the price moves too far to be profitable, if I wait for the price to test the trendline it may never come back like the move we had today. I'm good at taking trades at retracements as you see from the screenshots I post, but I couldn't find a consistent way to take such trades. I wanted to know if you had a consistent way of trading these or a set of rules for such positions.

Hi Ish. As for me when I'm trading something like you did here or simple 1-2-3 pattern the only filter as I have for now is that in bullish condition on low and higher low, can't be divergence on oscillator, same in bearish, high and lower high without divergence on oscillator.  
This increased % of winning trades from this pattern, however you should use it only with high volatility conditions.

Trend lines are **subjective**. Note the difference in my chart. In addition the Trendlines really are not even lines are _areas_ of several pips depending on the fractal (or timeframe where we are).  
  
I do not have a set of _rules_ to systematize what breaks will be good or not.  
  
I use the**story of the wave** in varying degrees, as well as price action (and I rely a lot on a momentum indicator, as it provides me, because I know read it, a view of the price action, even clearer, sometimes the price itself, all mutitimeframe).  
  
I look at the chart at M5, at first. If this suggests to me something, then go on to analyze in higher degrees, to be clear what chances I have for the next movement. Always seek the chart which I recognize patterns better.  
After a technical analysis better or worse, there comes a time when the trendlines, to me, are losing importance, and reference only serve me, not an obstacle.  
  
And as always, be fore figure how much can I **lose** anything if I'm wrong side of the market (Stoploss).

After studying the history of the waves, I can speculate that has been started at least a _corrective pattern._  
A corrective pattern comprises at least _three waves._  
  
The first wave, the**wave A** , often violent and fast (have closed many trades, at some level, suddenly.  
Then comes a little calm and uncertainty, the wave becomes complex, is the**wave****B** , which corrects vawe A (whose speed is not allowed to carry out all transactions).  
And finally comes the**wave** **C** , which has the structure impulsive going into directionn wave a, and whose purposes are different (usually create liquidity, or try the strength of the currency pair.  
  
I do labeling in the chart is an estimate, because I'm not a specialist Elliot. The trader need not be labeled specialist.  
  
.......................................................................................................................................  
A similar analysis shows EURAUD. From a chartist point of view, it was easier for me.

Forgot to say that in smaller timeframes, volume changes, news and session changes are, finally causing volatility in the expected direction if the analysis is correct.

My English is very bad, and may not have been entirely clear. I will be happy to respond, to the extent of my knowledge, anything that is not understood well.  
  
But first appreciate everyone do their homework, ie, try to resolve your concerns itself, because it is the best way to learn.  
  
Then we can discuss your own solution to mine and enrich each other.

EURUSD M5  
  
We are not in times of high volatility, but I have noticed a change in the volume of EU.  
Maybe it's interesting to look long.

Either way you have to very careful here. It might even be interesting to wait out the main correction and look for short trades.  
That depends on the taste and style of trader ..

On GJ and EJ we are in a second wave, so I think we will be heading south for 50 fibo number maybe.. The other option is, that price will make 1-2-3 patern and after that it will be clear that we should go up.  
  
What do you think?

I am looking for long EURUSD, but with great care, and a **stoploss** indisputable.

Although in the first post I propose a **template**. This is only a _basic example_.  
I want you to know that there is _freedom_ to publish the way you like.  
All I ask is that the chart was _intelligible_ , and that you will provide some _explanation_ about what we could escape.

Good morning.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Thanks for your chart. I see that you've used the H1 timeframe, 4 moving averages, Bollinger bands, and two oscillators (MACD and RSI). Besides tools such as S & R and Fibonacci.  
  
I usually use the template that normally you see in my publications (Bollinger Bands 50 periods, a EMA233, and RSI). Besides tools such as S & R and Fibonacci. I should add, that timeframes M5-M15, also use much besides the EMA34 and EMA89.  
Normally my analysis tries to be multitimeframe, although the aim is to obtain favorable intraday transactions, timeframes 1-15 minutes.  
  
I wonder what periods you use for your moving averages and Bollinger, and also know what timeframe make your decisions.

I should add, that timeframes M5-M15, also use much besides the EMA34 and EMA89. Normally my analysis tries to be multitimeframe, although the aim is to obtain favorable intraday transactions,...

This is an example of another template which I also like, for M5 and M15.  
As shown, the template that is used in Sonic unless I add EMA233 and Bollinger50.  
Or, put another way, is the template ORS to which I add the Dragon and EMA89.

Sounds good to me. I'm a scalper and the early hours of London, provided I find the easiest, so I look for trades, however small.

118,40 its a good support but in medium /long term I would say to buy because the inflation did'nt improve and in the end of this month will be another meeting of BoJ so maybe will extend again the program. anyway if the FED will not raise the interest rate in June will be in September

I agree, I have a similar opinion, but support me more technical than fundamental reasons, although the right would link both.

Thank you for your compliments, and congratulations on your successes. I can boast a long time I reached the consistency ago. That does not mean that I was not wrong. I'm wrong as anyone, but I learned when I close my losses, and when I leave them run a little.  
  
My last brake is in trying to locate Fractals varying degrees, to know when I'm not d the market side. Still that does not involves substantial risk, because then I change my mind, backed by thousands of hours of experience, and I have no resort to take the opposite trade what I thought, as happened to me yesterday with the EURUSD, for example.  
  
All I feel is that now that I move in the market, many times, I lack energy.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

it's funny to see after trying to short a pair this much and ending up with just 40 pips, you could have got about 150-200 pips...  
anyway, I think I'm done this week. see you all later...

I never get all the pips, you can see every transaction I do. So I proposed a quota, trying to keep as regular as possible.

yeah patron, I know that nobody can get all the pips. I had also doubled my daily target (which is 40 pips). so those trades would be a bonus before weekend. I just wanted to share my attempts. anyway, feeling the market's rhythm and estimating the turning points correctly give me hope about the future.  
  
on the other hand, about leaving an open trade, my account is still at the accumulating phase (I call it this way). for this reason, I need everything I can get from a trade. but in the future (may be in a couple of months time) I think of using an EA to manage my trades to close 80-90% at a certain level and leave the rest for further targets with stops at break even.  
  
thanks for your thoughts, by the way... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
have a nice weekend

Good evening !  
  
EURUSD short term trend is undefined / sideways, but EMA233 is still rising.  
  
My plan:  
Open short EURUSD if line of support changes to line of resistance. Target is next line of support. @ approx 1.0784 (+15 pips)  
Open short again if second line of suport becomes resistance Target approx 1.0740 (+40 pips)  
  
This is a counter-trend trade, so I will stop immediately if price reverses back over the line.

I'm stuck with EURUSD and EURJPY.  
  
The GBPUSD I have not analyzed. But it seems that became a resistance.

EURUSD M5  
  
The first is a pending order, and second, price action. I do scalping and close in as projection of the wave of the same grade.

GBPJPY  
  
You have captured perfectly it would be a retracement, or u change in trend at that level. Notice how the price is introduced into bollinger bands, while RSI will diverge. The rest is draw a line and buy with the price action.  
Very good trade, for my taste. Congratulations.

I had to leave after I posted my chart. you were right patron, bears kept the daily pivot. I didn't like the PA on m1, by the way. there was a divergence with RSI at the first visit. for that reason I pulled my stops to +40.   
  
by the way, if the price crosses 1.4920 on GU, we may see a further movement till 1.4870 at least...  
  
as I accomplished my daily goal, see you all tomorrow... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

hi toni, congrats on your trade. just a few comments I have about your chart:  
\- I understand that you traded the breakout of a consolidation, however your stop was not at a reasonable place. the engulf level where you placed your stop is just the beginning of the latest demand zone (according to my criteria) and it is likely that this level would be visited before going further up. placing your stop below the latest low would be more reasonable in my opinion. however, in that case your R:R would suffer much. on the other hand, the price had made a new lower low, which means price was in a downtrend, and which makes your trade a countertrend.  
\- if I were you I would wait for the price go up and trade at the level where support turns into resistance. see my post #1190. by this way you could get much better R:R for your trade.  
  
here is the chart you posted with some lines on it...

hey toni, I just wanted to explain my previous post a bit more. you can see my bonus GBPUSD trades below. it's not the same setup with yours but a very close one. price went down breaking a support decisively (blue line) then retraced back. when it reached to previous support PA went through it without stopping. it was also a bit shallow retracement (38.2% fibo level) however, there was a supply level above confluencing with 50%, yellow MA and upper bollinger band. then divergence occurred with RSI. second top was a better level by the way. the risk:reward was about 1:4. (I'm talking only for the first trade, by the way)  
  
M1 GBPUSD +68 pips

as we all know market repeats itself and as intraday traders all we need is just one solid setup. from my experience I know that this setup consistently works well. if you study charts and trade this properly it would have positive effect on your balance, I assure you. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60e.png?v=15.1)

It is a perfect example, you will not find in books.

Hello _maxtil_. Know that this system requires knowledge of the nature of the market (fractal) of wave analysis (generalized) of Chartism, Price Action, and general Technical Analysis as well as the influence of the sessions (liquidity), news (volatility) and interrelations between currency pairs.  
  
All these issues are readily available through the internet.  
  
All these skills have tried to place them in a simple template that facilitates visual assessment of market conditions at a given fractal level.  
This template would give us signals so we searched through all the aforementioned tools, settings and setups high probability of success, according fractal.  
  
All this is easier than it seems, if we do our homework on all the tools you can use in the analysis.  
Without forgetting the monetary management.  
  
The purpose of this thread is precisely to share these methods in order as simple as possible. In the thread you'll find daily good examples to follow, which, I am sure, gradually you will go illuminating.  
Likewise, the purpose of this thread is mutual motivation in solving all the problems that provides market and share.

Anyway, maxtill, do not deprive yourself of more specific questions, for the part that touches me, I will try to answer all with maximum clarity within my experience.

Good evening,  
  
In the Dynamic Scalp System thread, Patron taught me that EMA233 can often be a key price level.  
  
In the trade idea from yesterday, I offer an illustration of EMA233 behaviour.

Morning!![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
**USDCAD** M5-H1  
Long closed.  
  
Over the past Asian session, there was a moment I opened my charts and realized that USDCAD (H1), had a high probability of correct up to 38% fibo.  
I went down to USDCAD (M5) and other timeframes, and everything pointed to the price would rise.  
  
I opened a long trade, to a market condition lateral-bullish (M5), and went to sleep.  
Now, before the session in Frankfurt, I found the price to a resistance, and have decided to close.

It is true that, for me, the 233 EMA plays a big role in my trading for any timeframe. Both incline and closeness-distance of the price it offers a simple glance, much information about the condition of the market at a certain level. Any manual backtesting demonstrates this fact.  
In the chart you offered us yesterday is clearly seen as the price will change direction around the EMA233 until price action leaves no doubt.

EURUSD H1  
  
This pair is receding more than technically expected. Perhaps it is not surprising given the lack of agreement between Greece and the European Union on its debt.

no problem, mate. if you are serious about trading this way, I would advise you something. now that you have a setup, go through history of any pair, any timeframe and find 10, 20 or maybe even 50 examples of that. take screenshots, take down some notes, look left, go lower timeframes (if not m1) and see how price behaved. do that until you feel comfortable about it. and ask yourself the question, "why?". why did the price turn from here? why didn't this support/resistance work? why here? you'll soon find the answer. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

congrats on your success, patron...  
  
I fullfilled my quota, too. but today the PA didn't have any momentum, so I hesitated a lot and closed my trades too soon. anyway, I think that's it for me today. see you later...  
  
today's winners...

GBPUSD M5-M30  
  
The price comes out of a wedge wave starting from a double bottom.  
I'll take profits here and I'll rest.  
  
I think the price will probably go up further, as have liquidity.

Isengoz, Congratulations!![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f973.png?v=15.1)  
You have used a different method to me, looking (confirm) over the higher timeframes, allowing you squeeze, true to your style, this currency pair. I really like the trades you have done, but require a lot of energy for me anymore.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
Thanks for posting.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

> {quote} no problem, mate. if you are serious about trading this way, I would advise you something. now that you have a setup, go through history of any pair, any timeframe and find 10, 20 or maybe even 50 examples of that. take screenshots, take down some notes, look left, go lower timeframes (if not m1) and see how price behaved. do that until you feel comfortable about it. and ask yourself the question, "why?". why did the price turn from here? why didn't this support/resistance work? why here? you'll soon find the answer. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Totally agree. Although it may seem absurd, the best method of learning is work smart **backtesting** , beyond books and courses. What I can confirm that I am self-taught. And I just started to be consistent, when I started to answer my own questions, through the experience of backtesting.

Yes I got up early and took a look at the charts. Then the activity (**volume**) caught my attention, and I was doing **scalping**.

No I'm not saying I do not like harmonics. What happens is that I "get dirty much the chart" for scalping. When I analysis, sometimes also use harmonics.  
And who knows them properly should.  
  
I'm friends with any **tool** that the trader knows how to use to take **advantage** in the marketplace.

GBPUSD  
  
It is interesting to observe the evolution of GBPUSD, since the Asian session until the European window.  
It is good to look at volume changes where the smart money placed their orders for long. After the European window, the EMA34-89-233 were perfectly aligned, but when the news was coming, so the market pushed the price down, looking for liquidity, which tends to happen quite often (not always) before the news.  
Finally the news sent prices through the roof.

Good afternoon.  
  
If AUDUSD does not break above the long term trend, I plan to short approx 0.7820 , expect resistance at EMA233 / 0.7804, resistance to 0.7777. A bonus if I reach 0.7750  
  
Positive factors:  
RSI down trend  
Good gap to EMA233  
Similar picture on higher timeframes  
  
Negative factors:  
Trend rollover is not yet proved, so need to stop if uptrend continues.  
AUD news scheduled at open of the next session, so will not hold trade all day.

**AUDUSD** daily  
  
Hello _greenline_. Thanks for explain your views on the AUDUSD.  
  
I know that the timeframe M5 is far from the daily timeframe. However, Big Picture appears in a major correction against the general downtrend.  
Therefore, if you get any intraday downtrend, I recommend you do not miss Big Picture view, perhaps, may cause intraday uptrends.  
The RSI shows a clear divergence or loss momentun of daily downtrend.  
The price has been installed to the right of the first major trendline.  
The volume increases in South candles.  
All this makes me think that it is likely a major correction is on a daily basis, we have to take into account when we make decisions to intraday level.

Of course intraday analysis remain valid. Even the price will drop much. All I want is that the trader consider the Big Picture, and then a good multitimeframe analysis before making decisions.

Thank you Patron for showing the Day chart - I had not checked the Big Picture when I proposed the trade.  
  
Having looked at the higher timeframes, my view is now cautious; this situation is not clear, I will see what happens at open, and maybe look for a clearer opportunity.  
  
I have a question about volume - I cannot get volume(number of trades) information, so can I judge volume based upon the High to Low distance of the candle?

I understand that you mean the **range** of candles.  
  
The range of candles indicates **volatility**.  
  
The volume indicates **liquidity** , regardless of rank.  
  
Therefore are _different signals._

There may be a lot of liquidity and low volatility over a period of consolidation**, accumulation, distribution.**  
  
  
The _volume_ is closely related to the **smart money** trying to adopt the best positions from the best sites.  
  
The _volatility_ is more common at the beginning of the sessions at the beginning of the news, and is more related to the **emotional** part of the trader.

I have tried the market condition of this pair as _lateral trend_. From there, I took **scalping** decisions at that level through technical analysis.

Lateral trend can change to uptrend ... scalped to R1 (resistance)  
  
I waited for a break after the beginning of the American session, because it seemed safer.

AUDUSD M5  
  
I lost the chance to make this trade, which seemed easy, but was distracted.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1)

phew, it was a hard day for me...  
  
In the morning, I was bullish for the AUDUSD and EURUSD. so I longed the aussie at the lowest point, but got stopped out at BE.

then I went to EURUSD, longed it a couple of times. but I got kicked out every time I longed it. and finally I was able to catch the move and I got out at about the RN and went into profit for about 40 pips. if I didn't take so many losses before that (about -130 pips) I would keep my trades till my target which just hit a moment ago (1.0925) and I could have ended my day at about +200 pips...

I always say that the **stoploss** are sacred, and respect for them is part of the Holy Grail when it comes to success in this business.  
My criteria for stoploss is a function of _volatility_ , as well as the proximity of higher-order _fractals_.  
Leveraging your work on the EURUSD, I will give an example of how he had placed the stoploss. If we use the volatility that had at that time, I could have used, or the farthest part of the bollinger bands or own trend line you drew below minimum or a major support (S1).  
  
All this is because I think the Big Picture is bullish.  
  
__Entry_ into the wave labeled **1** is _premature_ because no reverse pattern .  
__Entry_ into the wave labeled **2** is _safer_ , because it could potentially be a double bottom, but then the stoploss must respect the volatility of the moment or relevant support. The new session (NY) is close.  
  
__Entry_ labeled Wave **3** is of **high probability** , because it has all the ingredients to not fail: Big Picture, new session, reverse pattern, overcoming the previous two relevant maximum price, EMA233 overcoming, overcoming the daily pivot , attack the upper bollinger band, strongly bullish RSI ... and if studied carefully is also seen accompanying volumes.  
  
I understand that hindsight is easy to tell this, but so will tell backtesting.  
  
  
**EURUSD** M5

morning...  
  
I closed last night's trades for +100 pips. I expect a retracement at least to 1.09 with the European open. I will use these retracements to get short till we cross yesterday's high.

thanks for the insight, patron.  
  
about stoplosses, I open a trade when I think the price movement (ie. wave) is over, so keep my stops as tight as possible. if price makes a new high or low that shows me the move is not over. however, there are times like yesterday that we lack momentum and price moves laterally. that's when I get my losses most of the time. normally, I would stay put till the price breaks the consolidation zone (which means crossing the latest high in this setup) but I knew the bulls' target (you can see from TPs of my trades) and tried to be in the move as soon as possible. that's why I lost that much. as I increased my risk percentage recently I need to be more careful though...

A wave always ends with a reverse pattern, and always begins with a reverse pattern, the same degree or level as the wave.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

yeah, I'm bearish till we cross 1.0926 (ie yesterday's high), and expect some moves up before going further down (last efforts for the bulls and opportunities to get short for the bears). I will use those up moves to get short. but if we cross and go above 1.0926, that's another story... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

it depends on what you look at. if we don't go above yesterday's high as I mentioned in my previous post, I expect a retracement of about 150 pips. that might not change the overall direction of the trend on H4 or D1, but I decided to short the pair today that's why I'm bearish. it hasn't made any new lows above M5 timeframe by the way. from that perspective you're right that the pair is still bullish. anyway, I will see whether I'm right or wrong in a couple of hours...

I think there could be a correction at these levels ... We'll see.  
But be careful because it seems that the uptrend is not over.

Definitely, the **euro** is very **strong**. It is very difficult to get into a **trend** , when you expect a retracement, and none of the pairs of the euro has given me that opportunity. So I have to **wait** for any relevant news or a change in session, or take a day's leave not go amiss.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

hi patron, I agree what you wrote. I also expect a retracement (actually I was waiting for it 2 days ago ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) ) but it seems like the bulls are not done yet. maybe GBPUSD might be a better option today as the EURUSD has reached its ADR and I can't estimate what it will do next...

nice trades patron. well, I'm not that lucky today. besides I don't feel comfortable about my trades this week. that makes me pull stops to breakeven sooner and get stopped out more.   
  
the first group went up to +40 pips, and the second group would be around +70 pips by now. in the end, I am up about +1 pip ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

It's a shame. You could already have the full quota. To me, because my style of scalping, I usually go better these types of situations o**f lateral trend,** with enough range. When the trend is strong me a hard time getting on it.  
  
**EURUSD** M1  
  
I tried this wave as if a **wave** of type **C**(looking for liquidity). If this wave is so we do not know when it will end, but I think I've earned enough pips today.

I think you've closed well, we can not aspire to 100%.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Type C waves are unreliable, since they depend on the liquidity needed, but also the emotional state of the traders. A chartist is enough to figure out, and volume.

Given that today is a public **holiday** in most of Europe, I have chosen today, for intraday trading, **Pound** pairs as they announced an more _volatility, volume and liquidity._

I thought I was not going to do trading with the **EURO** today, but has been put technically easy, and I have not resisted the temptation.

Good morning.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Probably my trading **plan** for today will be dedicated to the evolution of the EURUSD intraday as well as the EURJPY.  
  
At first, my analysis indicates that these currency pairs remain bullish. However, as I descended from timeframe, I think we are at the beginning of a _correction_ , perhaps wide enough to look short in intraday trading.  
  
So my trading will mainly search for **short** , unless proven otherwise.  
  
Like any plan, it is subject to **change** as the market moves.

> Good morning.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) Probably my trading plan for today will be dedicated to the evolution of the EURUSD intraday as well as the EURJPY. At first, my analysis indicates that these currency pairs remain bullish. However, as I descended from timeframe, I think we are at the beginning of a correction, perhaps wide enough to look short in intraday trading. So my trading will mainly search for short, unless proven otherwise. Like any plan, it is subject to change as the market moves.

I could imagine something like this, such plan.  
Of course this is purely speculative and can happen many different variations of this plan. But it is a way to have a probable guide.  
Wave to wave, I will check if this is viable.  
  
Naturally I can be totally wrong, and then would have to reconsider my trading.

I know I said I was going to get **shorts** , and I still think the same, but if I see enough _range_ to the contrary, do fast **scalping**.

EU and EJ M15  
  
I have drawn two levels of **support** that may be important today. What do you think?

morning patron...  
  
you were right as usual. thanks for the heads up... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
I shorted GBPUSD and EURUSD after the (fake) up move at Frankfurt open. I tried to play safe this time (ie I didn't try to catch tops/bottoms). I'm done for the day with +80 pips...   
  
M1 GBPUSD & EURUSD +41 pips each

I am glad and I congratulate you. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f973.png?v=15.1)  
  
I made trading in fake up (for liquidity) because I saw enough range and low risk, and when I reached the daily pivot, I waited to take the shorts than planned for this morning.  
  
I'm short EU and EJ, a little more.

I can tell you my experience. Unless clear chances, neither I seek the tops or bottoms. And I do better as well. Sometimes yes I enter to trade for very strong reasons using the volume and support / resistance very clear, but they are _exceptions_ to the rule await **confirmation**.

I absolutely agree with you, patron. although catching the trade at the top or bottom feels orgasmic, I sometimes loose my sync with the market and then get some serious losses due to my misinterpretation of the PA. that's why I decided at the weekend to take smaller but safer trades. my another issue is taking too many trades. I have some itchy fingers. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) now I'm working on it. I'm trying not to take more than two trades for each setup, at least until I secure the first ones.

I got another 40 from GBPUSD by the way... I didn't like the divergence around Friday's low. so I quit a little earlier than I expected...

Congratulations on your last two trades. In the last trade, it shows something in a hurry to get in, but I'm sure that every day you will realize that no need to hurry.  
Every day there are opportunities in the London session and the American session. Thanks for posting, so those interested in scalping find good examples to follow.

I might have closed a bit early, but I have 5 folded my daily target and that was enough for me. today proved me once more that by "trading smaller but safer" I can also get much over my target without stomachache or headache. and I don't need to follow many pairs. just 2 of them is more than enough.  
  
see you all later...

That scenario is possible. However there are several ways to do so, such price may rise before falling to 38% fibo. So I say **"wave to wave",** and do not forget Big Picture.

I, for example, for **scalping** , I am looking for long trades (wave B), later to search again short trades (wave C) ...  
  
Of course these are personal speculations which need not be met. In this case I change my mind and seek other scenarios.

The fact that I think this is because of the following. If I imagine a simple three-wave correction, we'd be in wave A. Sometimes wave A reaches the 38% fibo, sometimes not, and is corrected by wave B, and eventually happen wave C in the same direction would wave A.  
This is a simple correction imagined, we do not know if it will. So "wave to wave," knowing that the market condition, Big Picture, is lateral and bullish.  
  
Of course these are personal speculations which need not be met. In this case I change my mind and seek other scenarios.

If we apply the systems **ORS**(Of Road System) into these scenarios for **intraday** scalping, look for a _pattern reverse_ against the intraday trend or _Price Action_ for the trend, taking into account the main intraday _levels_. It's that simple.

In addition, the **EMA233** can be a good reference for change at **M1** , while **SMA50** can be a good reference for the change at **M5**.  
  
Amen**trend lines** and **support / resistance** at those levels.

Similar to the EURUSD so, I tried the wave as if it were a wave B, then maybe go up a little more. But my daily quota is highly satisfied. So my job ends here, today, I think.

Good morning.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
GBPUSD H1  
  
Good morning.  
First, again as usual, I re-analyze intraday wave to wave. But in principle, for the GBPUSD, I have drawn a few fibos at different levels, and together with the pivots I find an area (Bisque) interesting. However, do not rule out further rises, although the Asian session has already moved unusually range.  
In short, I am bullish, me too, until proven otherwise to intraday level.

EURUSD H4  
  
As for the EURUSD, I have reservations, and take decisions intraday. I do not know if **1.13000** come to be a strong **resistance** , or if (to a greater degree) the price remains bullish. For now, I will take the last high price as a strong resistance and be willing to take short positions.  
I need some more analysis ...

Scalped for +12 pips...  
  
It is probably another bearish wave, but my quota is satisfied ... and my job too.

EURUSD H4.  
  
If we consider the last bullish wave as a **impulse** wave structure, then the **projections**(in this case is an external projection) Fibonacci not rule out that the price approaches around **1.14000**.  
  
However, the correction in which we now have to finish before resuming the upward path, beyond 1.13000  
  
Still fit most types of analysis to corroborate or refute these provisional conclusions ...

I took some trades last night after I wrote here, and continued to short the pairs during the day. I'm up around 550-600 pips on 8 positions at the moment. I decided to treat these trades like a basket and activated my money management EA to close all trades at BE. so this time I have no hard stop loss but around 70 pips of breathing space per trade.  
  
anyway, the charts...

morning...  
  
yesterday my positions got stopped out at +10 with GU's up move. luckily when I was kicked out of my positions I was in front of my computer and took 3 buy positions on GU at around 1.5260 thinking that the election results would have positive effect on the pair. to be honest I aimed for about 35-40 pips of profit per position, but the day started with a huge gap so I got +440 pips of profit (on 3 trades). that saved my day. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) unfortunately I got kicked out of my EU positions, too. the pair advanced about 40 pips more which could add 160 pips (on 4 positions) to my balance if I were still in. my target is intact on EU, although GU is now invalidated. anyway, that's it for now...  
  
see you later...

GBPJPY M1  
Technical treatment similar to GU. That is, I grasp a situation likely reverse in times of liquidity, and experience tells me that the intraday odds are great. Therefore I look long for scalping intraday levels.

At the gates of a change of session I wanted to take a look, and I found it easy to take a few pips by scalping the GBP.

Good morning.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
For EU & EJ, I look for _intraday_ level for the time being, **short** positions (short term scalping, M1-M5).  
That is, I decide to speculate in favor of the intraday **trend** , while not clearly change.  
  
Any comments would be appreciated.

morning patron...  
  
as for the EU, I am also bearish and my previous (last week's) target of 1.1060 is within daily range now. so I'm planning to short the pair if it retraces back to the lines I drew around 1.1180-1.1195.  
  
by the way, on friday I got stopped out at BE once more, I hardly refrain myself from taking revenge trades...

Isengoz,   
I agree. I also expect a good pattern reverse to M1 in a "significant" level intraday, to take short. If it does not, I'll have to change my mind.  
Nor can I forget that the Big Picture, following the shorts that I hope remains bullish until the contrary is proved.  
So, as always, wave to wave, respecting the rules, and discipline, there is plenty of time to make good trades.

The first trade of both the EU and the EJ, I said that these are **discretionary**. Why? because it does not expect _confirmation_. And this is because these trades are based on _multitimeframe_ analysis, and also a sudden change in _volume_ , an important intraday _resistance_ level, and the beginning of the _London_ session is observed.

EURUSD  
  
I do not have clear yet. So I'll be _careful_.  
  
I do not rule even go **down** to 1.1060 (or around _blue_ area).  
But if it follow **up** , I would not rule out the _salmon_ area first.

Thank you. I've been lucky. Today I woke up early and I found these high probability trades for scalping after a quick analysis.  
Actually I prefer to wait for the London session, but the matter seemed too clear to let it go.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Good Morning![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
EURUSD H4  
  
In my opinion, after analysis of the correction greater, Big Picture, as long as below 1.1280 keeps the probability of return to 1.1060 (blue zone). Therefore, according to the intraday ranges, it is likely that I look for **short** trades.  
  
Naturally, we can not predict the market. We can only look for high probability situations, and a plan, which may be changed, depending on market responses.

The market condition is **uncertain** , and there is no _definition_. I've done very fast **scalping** within a triangle, but I'll wait for the market to be clearly defined.  
  
Scalping for +27 pips.

_To the readers of this thread ..._  
  
I think my work in this thread has finished, there are enough examples to those who are interested in this form of trading, to create their own _personal_ system, from the simplicity of it.  
  
I am especially grateful to **isengoz** and **jstmzplsz** , for his part, because their concerns got me thinking and I've improved. I've missed some traders, such as **shantala** , on which I had high hopes because of the relationship established between the waves and RSI.  
  
I still think it's a good thread for those **serious traders** who want to share their views.  
This is not intended to be a massive thread, because you have to have some level stopping understand and share the _essence of the market._ But the exchange of ideas between 4 or 5 **TRADERS** encourage them between them and benefit them.  
  
Thanks to all.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Hi Patron,  
  
Are you leaving us? I learned alot from you guys and am still learning as I am still making mistakes....  
  
Below are the trades I have taken today. Are those trades within ORS? Or am I being lucky? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Hello **kelvintc**. First, thank you for sharing your trading decisions.  
  
My answer is very simple. I try not to leave you, but I will not continue further with my monologues. I will try to _answer the specific questions_ received from you, with pleasure, or at least I will give my opinion.  
  
In what _today_ is concerned, I will say that the trades you made are correct (**ORS**), and I would do the same or similar. But an analysis on H4, has led me to conclude that the _correction_ which is underway at this level, it needs another bearish wave, before finishing the upward correction. Then I changed my mind and I have sought only short.  
  
Still the trades you made are correct for me because the market was _lateral_ M1 (look at moving averages, sma50 and ema233, without inclination, and the bands of Bollinger). And markeT was _bullish intraday_(ema89>ema233, M1), then you look for longs, then correct.  
  
I hope I have answered your questions.  
  
Later I was not so sure if the 1.1280 level I set myself I was right because I did not use the time H4 as well as in intraday. But what good is having an initial plan, and a system to use.  
  
If intraday level using the ORS system, you will get consistent profits, then our fears and lack of discipline and damage the system will be in charge. Therefore, we work.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Thanks for your insights. I hope I can be as consistent as you and isengoz. Below is what I see from EU M30. Intraday seems to be bullish.

Good morning.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
I have an overview similar, for EURUSD. But I have some difficulties assessing the Big Picture, because according to my calculations, I still have a corrective wave down.  
So today, surely, I must cling more to the system.  
Also we see how it affects the market that has important holiday in some European countries.

morning patron...  
  
I expect the bulls to push the price up till 1.1425. that will be the level I'll be watching on Euro. then, I think the bearish wave we've been expecting will become. also the divergence being created on H1 supports my idea. surely it's just an idea...

I also think we are in the fifth wave. But I was looking bearish wave was on the fourth, above this level. Therefore, at some point I missed in my analysis.But it does not worry because even if we are wrong in the analysis, the system can rescue us, and it's best not operate against the system.  
From 1.14 or 1.15, there will surely be a bearish wave same degree as the latter bullish wave. While I believe that from now on have to confirm trades well.

yep, and the upper trend line must have been a factor that I should have considered in my analysis. I missed that. that's why I'm angry with myself...

EURUSD M1  
  
I will think short when I find a good Price Action under EMA 233 or under clear blue trendline.  
  
Maybe I can think about the possibility of a rebound in nickline and think short trades.

patron, is it a general rule of your trading plan not to take short trades under EMA 233, or is it just relevant to this setup?

It is not a general rule. Depending on the _degree of wave_ I estimate that is ending, then I took roughly precautions.  
If they are lesser degree waves, I do not need much to change direction, just two trendline would be worth me (or sma50).  
Could reverse wave (H4) is about 900 pips, then, is not worth me two trendline at M1. This wave may need more space and more time to reverse.  
It is a choice I make a little discretion, depending on the different degrees or **fractals** in waves.  
  
_Moving averages_ are not mathematically precise references, for me. They are only _visual references_ for the market condition at some level.  
They are more accurate **fractals** to know if out of a wave or a wave entered.

morning everyone...  
  
yesterday the price didn't break the compression directly as I expected, but the break and retracement did happen. so I expect the big down move today. I already got about +40 pips with the Frankfurt open. I expect a retracement to 1.14 area, for that reason I closed my shorts. if and when we reach there I plan to short again...   
  
the bigger picture of EURUSD as I see it...

Good morning.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
I do not look alike. I hope a new high. But we can not know. So cautiously, with the right leverage, and wave to wave.

EURUSD  
The situation for the Big Picture is not clear to me. So chances are that I go by scalping within short deadlines.

Hi Patron and Isengoz,  
  
You guys are still so impressive. Yesterday I made some big mistakes (buy at top, sell at bottom --> false breakouts). Today I made two mistakes too, as show in chart below.  
  
First trade was trying to sell after I thought there is a trendline break. Luckily it ended up at BE.  
The -15 trade was entered after I thought it bounced off the blue trendline and broke previous high.  
Any comments from you guys?  
  
Btw, how do you guys show the order history on chart?I have to change to bar charts for them to show up nicely.  
  
Have a nice weekend!

AUDUSD last week - sideways market - I missed this setup.  
Is this a triple-tap ? I understand that three strong re-tests on a trending line can be reliable pattern?

Good Mornig![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
In my view, you have done some very good trades, ending in positive, and so we have to congratulate you.  
  
The failed trade had its difficulties, and have responded very well when you realize that most initial wave (pink) was not over and that the light blue area was a retracement (correction).  
  
The error may be that after the breakdown of retracement (see trendlines and zone yellow), you decide to take long.

I must confess that while this retracement is not broke, I was also looking for long, because my analysis indicated that missing me at least another maximum, however this did not happen until a flag is not completed.  
  
See [http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...73#post8264073](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=8264073#post8264073), instead of engulfing since I was looking long.

If the template that you use good results, use it. But I can not help sharing with you that the short moving average you use is too fast to M1. In my opinion, for short distances it is best to try to catch the wave and use trendlines linking relevant points.  
Likewise, changing the MACD, with faster parameter favoring either not comparing price action on the measure.  
Of course, these are things that experience has taught me that the indicators are best used with its default settings, to always have the same scale. However, I insist that if it is useful to you and you take advantage of them as well, be sure to do it on my reviews.

I make my trades preferably during the London session and as soon as possible (with permission of the market)  
I know that you, Greenline, you do not have schedules freely because of your work. Anyway I hope you've found the right timeframe mode and your needs.  
  
Indeed, the pattern that you point out to us**is a triple tap** , which could have extracted a few pips.  
I did not see, at the time, because after the London close, I try not to operate. But it points it is useful for us to see that there is life after London too, although generally the price ranges quite often shortened unless there is significant news.  
Therefore I can only say thank you for sharing your comment thread.

Good morning Patron. Thanks for your kind words and advice. As you point out, I will try to change something to the short MA and also MACD, as sometimes I use it as a confirmation to seek entry (but the result is not always positive).  
  
Seems like EU is still in an upward channel, with a possible wedge forming?

EURUSD  
  
For me the EURUSD remains bullish on the Big Picture, but increasingly have to take more care because it seems that we are the fifth wave, but may have major reversals, including the reverse of the trend.  
I do not grasp any clear figure chartist, I just see a loss of momentum at a higher level.  
Intraday prudence, patience, discipline and respect for rules.

Brilliant as usual. Congrats!  
  
I missed out the drop (hesitant to sell breakout, too many bad experiences in the past). Yet, the short I took in pullback was a loss as well.   
  
I refrain myself from taking revenge trade after the loss. Patiently waiting for the reversal, still seems like I have entered too early.  
  
Have a nice day!

Good for your _attitude_ and good for your _results_.  
  
None of **revenge**. That's fine.  
  
Maybe someday we should talk about **stoploss** , speaking not for revenge but to**retake the river course,** or discuss **confirmations**.  
  
As for the **breakdown** , I do not remember if I've ever written about them. One day I decided I only believe in breaks in times of high _liquidity_ and _volatility_(read at the beginning of the London session or at the beginning of the American session). But I would _monitor correlated_ currency pairs, and if necessary also to monitor the inverse correlated currency pairs. If everything fits, at the time the breaks tend to have high probability of success. It works for me this way to control breaks.  
I am open to other suggestions.  
  
The two trades that have successfully done are very important, because these _setups_ are very safe and are getting every day, either for a reverse or a significant correction. I congratulate you on these two trades. You are on the right track, if you maintain discipline, without trying to guess the direction of the market but to adjust to it.

Good morning ~  
  
Patron, I recalled you mentioned about breakouts at [http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...89#post8204989](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=8204989#post8204989) when Isengoz asked for your opinion. In the past, when I try to trade breakout, I often end up buying in the top or selling in the bottom. Perhaps the time of the session (as you mentioned) is important, which I have overlooked.  
  
From your trades, seems like you manage your trades so well. Always hit your TP before getting SL hit.  
  
I, on contrary, have very tight stoploss (especially in taking retracement/pullback entries).  
  
  
For today, I am not so clear about EU. Will EU resume the bullish trend?

I have no clear Big Picture. I think that this is a higher order correction, and today it could easily go down. But I'll gird my trading to intraday movements, wave to wave.  
  
It could also correct the last bearish wave. We'll see.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

GU big picture seems clearer, after bouncing off support around 1.5630-ish.. Perhaps there will be a reverseal pattern around support area which I might seek entries ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Breaks outs.  
Thanks for reminding me that post.  
Yes in that post I talked about the wave analysis, and consulting various timeframes. It is also useful to wait for price action after overcoming a major trendline, or an important support & resistance.  
What happens is that sometimes in very volatile sessions do not have time to wait for a good kick. So what I wrote about the correlation of currency pairs, use it.  
What it is clear is that any decision should be based on a single signal, but you have to capture a set of signals that increase the probability of success to the fullest.

Actually I did took the same short as isengoz (short EU), yet after few minutes, I changed my mind (to seek long around support).  
I scalp for few pips in a minor pullback. It worked and thus I seek entries for reversal, which bagged me few pips as well.  
how lucky ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

I'm waiting for a retracement, however the bulls still have no control over the price I guess. so I took some short scalps on EU...

yeah, thanks kelvin. actually I think the down move will continue till 1.10 today. but I decided to quit my trades while in profit and take some more after london opens. I hope I'm not wrong this time. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Seems like the downward train moves without waiting. This down move is really fast and furious.  
  
It looks like there is a support area around 1.1050-60.

Good morning friends. I see that all is well ...

I do not know which type of account, or batches that manage others. I think it's something private. In addition I also think that the reasoning and the system that we display is the same, whether in eal, either in demo (the one that would vary a bit is the psychology of the trader).  
I take this opportunity to welcome, aForexManiac, and invite you to share with us your views.

Good morning Patron~  
  
Today I missed out the reversal pattern around support area for EJ (triple bottom). I have scalped around fibo levels (with price action and some luck![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1) ) and bag few pips.

Nice trades! Congrats Patron.  
  
Did you decide to trade GBP pair due to the Euro related news? By the way, how does news affect your trade decision? You trade it or you avoid it?  
  
Today I took several trades in EU (red news during that time), which I am feel not comfortable, yet the setup looked nice to turn away. Probably I was extremely lucky this time.  
  
Some of the trades I made are outside of BB. Not following ORS rules too.

Thanks kelvintc.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
I thought both the euro and sterling could climb today. But it seemed easier sterling because the GBPJPY was clear uptrend.  
At the opening of London I took two similar to yours, with long euro trades, but was more comfortable with the pound.  
  
The ORS has some recommendations to try to address some ambiguous situations. These are only recommendations. The spirit of the system attempts to establish the market condition with a simple template. Once established market condition, I advise the price action as a trigger for entry. I also encourage readers to take him to his own personality.  
In short, once the market condition of bollinger bands established show us where a correction is born, or where a reverse born. However in violent rupture, the opposite side is the boss.  
  
I ask those who like this template you set how to act bands and moving averages, according to market conditions. I put examples and suggestions in the first post. But I think the system is very flexible and each trader can use it in their own way. I do not know if I did it, but I'm glad every time someone succeeds in this work.  
  
I did not publish my two trades of EURUSD, because there are many examples, but I found it interesting the strong movement of the GBPJPY.  
I congratulate you on your trades. I think mine are quite similar ...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

News.  
  
For news I have no fixed rules. I think I am guided by the smell and the Big Picture. If I have the Big Picture very clear, I do not avoid the news. But if I'm not clear about the Big Picture, then I avoid the news.

Good morning friends ~  
  
Thanks Patron for your insights. I dont really use BB before, guess it is better to follow the rules to increase the odds.  
  
Today, seems like the EU correction might continue towards fibo and resistance level. Wave B?

Kelvintc good morning.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
It seems that there are good chances of that happening, to continue upward correction. We'll see what happens.

By the way, you do not use the EMA233?  
Because the situation of EMA233, I do not like at M30, normally the price is respect it on many occasions. We'll see what happens.

Yes, I do. use EMA233 on M1, use SMA50 on M5 onwards ([http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...39#post8244439](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=8244439#post8244439))

I use the same template for all timeframes. After all, the market is fractal. But you know I say that every trader should do what he thinks is best. In my case, the EMA233 know where it is in different timeframes helps me better understand the market condition.

In the post that references me, I recommend these moving averages as a further sign of possible changes in price direction. But it is only a sign that makes me pay attention to the time. A signal is not enough to make decisions. Furthermore, it is not the same as SMA50 EMA233 is above, below that.  
Nor is the same as those moving averages go in the same direction, in opposite directions, etc .., etc .. So the trader with a pair of moving averages, Bollinger bands, and a momentum indicator may by observation, get an idea of the market condition at different levels.

Thanks. I think I got what you mean. One signal is not enough. We need a set of signals (wave, price action, areas of interest, momentum indicatior). Together with MA, we can have a brief idea of the market. I am new to your ORS system, thanks for your sharing. Will try to benefit from your sharings ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
In trending market, EMA233 does looks like a dynamic support/resistance.

That's exactly what I intend. It works for me right this way to read the market. Sometimes I'm wrong, but the stoploss are for that, and so far there are more hits than errors.

I hope for the same as well ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) I like your 'quota' style, which can minimize one's exposure to the market (avoid over-trading).  
  
Sometimes, I am too greedy, pulling trigger before the confirmation (while there is no confirmation and pattern is not clear).  
Especially when the market suddenly decides to consolidate within ranges, I tend to buy at top / sell at bottom.  
  
Besides that, I feel like NY session has more news related (impact) moves. Perhaps I should ban myself from taking trades in NY session.

If you know your mistakes and your weaknesses, you have a great advantage to improve. I try to get my quota before 10:00 GMT. And almost never work the NY session.  
Right now, and I have my 50 pips, but I can not publish because it is a very short trading scalping (3 pips 5 pips 6 pips). If the market is not clear, then I close my live trading platform, and open a demo to practice new things or new ground, but not again risk my quota. And if I'm tired, because I'm going for a walk.

Congrats! Pips are pips. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Had few chances to grab and hit daily target (30-40), but ended up at BE. Looks like this europe session is another lateral undecided day.  
  
Knowing when to TP and when to hold the trade is something that I am still learning now.

hi guys...  
  
It was a hard day for me. In the morning, I made some newbie mistakes (yep, I still do them after 8 years of trading ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1) ) and went into negative 2x of my daily stop limit. then, I left my computer and calmed down. when I came back EURUSD was just at the place I was waiting since yesterday. then I shorted it for the last time and got 440 pips with the last move. while I am writing this post I see that it continued to advance lower (~50 pips more), which means I left a lot on the table again (~200 pips more on 4 positions)!! but I tripled my daily target, so I can't whine about it, right? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)   
  
M1 EURUSD +440 pips

I had taken some shorts on GU in the morning, too. but I closed them for a little deficit because I was not sure of the direction. If I hadn't, they would have added a lot to my profit, too...

Good morning ~  
  
Impressive result again. I had a negative day yesterday, due to revenge trades again.  
  
I am not so clear about EU and GU today. Wave 4?

I still think the down move will continue at least about 100 pips more, but I didn't like the recent divergence so I quit not to give my profit back at a retracement.

after yesterday's rally I've been expecting a retracement. I got some losses but in the end with the help of news I recovered and furthermore I more than tripled my daily target.

Hello friends. A long time ago I do not come here. But maybe it's time to take this for some time.  
As seen in my charts, I added a Cloud (emas 34-89), to visually give me the condition of the market, according timeframe or fractal.  
My idea is to make scalping to M1, during the London session. With a little experience it is easy to hunt some pips.

GBPJPY m1-m5  
  
Intraday long lateral trend, which I have tried to fish, making scalping, and accumulating 92 pips.  
I worked mainly on M1. But I show the chart M5 to cover the entire lateral trend.

I'm betting on the 138,500 level, perhaps because of the small gap that was there. But this is only an opinion. We must follow the step by step price.

I think that above 139,500, or above PIVOT daily, would have a good chance that the price will form a small uptrend.

It was not a good decision to allow 2 open positions. It was quieter and safer to take 70 or 80 pips. And close the day.  
That done, I always could re-enter, if I had more desire to work today.

Hello Landline,  
Thank you for sharing your method. The important thing is to be consistent and allow you to make money; If so, congratulations.  
I think I'm a little old to change, and do not need it because my view the market is profitable.  
Anyway if the reader takes advantage and gets benefits from it, so be it.  
My system is also very simple. I use a slow moving average and a cloud fractally for the market condition. Bollinger bands provide the volatility me, and MACD a short overview of the state of the wave.  
While the overall vision of the wave get in different fractals, visually, from different timeframes.  
General knowledge of technical analysis provides me with support, resistance, trend lines, Fibonacci retracements, Fibonacci projections, etc ...  
The rest is to treat knowledge as a way to obtain a high probability of being in the right side of the market, and properly managing capital. I try to operate in times of increased volatility in search of a daily goal. I pretend not spend too much time on the computer because the end is more what you want to see what there is.  
In my last trade it is clear that the cloud rises above the slow moving average; then the price gets side; my system says that the bullish odds are greater than the bearish; then I open long. Timeframes said upper missing a wave to the downside, but GBPJPY is very volatile and allows me to profit M1; then surely I would have looked short, but was no longer at the computer when it happened.

Today, I'll probably trade some very quick because I have not clear whether we are in reverse levels. Then I would expect that the price is more clearly defined.

Hi h4dy, I sincerely appreciate your welcome. Actually, I do not pretend to give lessons, but to share my view the market, waiting for you to do the same.  
But I'm not succeeding in that sense, so I'm wondering if it makes sense this monologue where I am the only person sharing.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

hey patron, welcome back. it's good to see you posting again. I hope you continue writing when you turn back from your holiday. I still use our good old offroad method for my trades, however these days I don't trade as often as I used to, which I hope will change in the near future.   
  
Today I got into some action which ended in profit. Entries were off the M15 but posting H1 for clear understanding.

I missed the long opportunity yesterday, as I closed my positions after Europe close. but joined the action with USD news today. 1.30 round number, daily ADR high, daily R3 pivot level, triple-top confluence gave me the opportunity to double my daily target... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f920.png?v=15.1)

the MM EA closed my positions a few pips earlier than I targeted as they reached my daily goal. I expect the next wave to end around 1.46. but that's another story, everyone should watch PA and make their own decisions...

as usual, the level I expected for the price to turn did not work out. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) if I had not quit those trades, I would sit on 450 pips more as the pair went 150 pips (x3 positions = 450 pips) further. I feel like a newbie chess player sometimes. most of the time, I can't see even one further step ahead. I play the game as I see it now... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)

today's profit came from GBPUSD. I'm sending H1 for better understanding the levels I watched and M5 for the entries. again my money management EA closed the trades when I reached my daily target. no need to be greedy, I think, especially on fridays...

then, I took some breakout trades which ended about +50 pips on GBPAUD. I could have re-entered at the test of the trendline but I had already shorted EURAUD. so I didn't want to both buy and sell AUD at the same time...

my recent trades I posted here have been from the demo account as I was away from the markets for a while and since I gained around 60% in 2 weeks I decided to turn back to my real account yesterday (on Friday). I was expecting a 100-150 pip fall for GBPUSD for the last 3 days so I waited till FED event. when the event started price fell around 70 pips and that was the part which messed up everything. I was actually waiting for a move upwards at first, then I would start shorting around 1.3250. but when the price fell suddenly I thought the move had started, then I started to short with the retracement. well, the chart below shows the end result. next week it looks like I need to work hard to cover that... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61f.png?v=15.1) that was a good lesson for me, though.

thanks, davidpet. I used to use myfxbook before, but then I decided that those charts influence my trading in a bad way that when I have a winning streak like a week or two, I tend to take more risk in order to keep that angle of the graph and finally I loose more than I should. for this reason, I don't use myfxbook anymore. and if you are asking for a signal service by "monitoring strategy", I'm against such things. I still believe that one should learn, study and develop his/her own way of trading.

ok, some more losers. actually my mindset was quite right that I thought the Sterlin would climb till 1.3150 at first, then would fall, then again go up. I longed it on the 30th, but got stopped out. I wish I didn't place my stops too tight, maybe below the black line at the LLs. the pair moved directly to my TP level. anyway, the next day (yesterday) I don't know what I was thinking by shorting the pair as the move to the upside had already started during Asian session. I didn't have much time to trade so didn't analyze it appropriately I guess.

ok, last week ended more or less at breakeven level. today was relatively slow considering the US holiday. after taking some losses in the morning I was able to enter at the top of GBPUSD. stops at BE for now. if the price makes a new LL then I will try to add during retracements...

well well, a hard kick and a lot of pain in my ass again. today I broke some important rules in my trading plan. one was not to add positions before a new HH or LL, but I added 3 more positions on GBPUSD. another was not to move stops if price retraces back, which I did and ended up in a bigger loss. and lastly, not to trade against the bigger picture. at the weekend when I analyzed the charts I was expecting a move to 1.35 this week. however, yesterday when I entered at the top I got a wrong thought that the price would retrace down to around 1.315 then would go up. I was expecting a reaction around where I entered my trades. well, actually I was right but didn't know where to stop apparently. anyway, the pair has about 100 pips to go before turning back, in my opinion. I won't look for longs any more but for short opportunities starting from 1.35.

at least I was right about one pair, EURJPY. 3 positions stops at BE. price made a new LL, so expecting further down move for now. let's see if I can take my losses back out of these...  
  
EURJPY

the pair continued its fall during asian session. I was expecting a retracement so didn't want to risk my gains and I quit my trades at around +400 pips... I will look for further shorting opportunities around the black lines I drew on the chart...  
  
EURJPY (+412 pips)

yesterday, I also mentioned that I wouldn't long the GBPUSD till 1.35. but I couldn't resist the temptation to do that after the price retraced and stopped around our offroad MA level. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) the positions may get stopped out, but I prefer to be on the train instead of waving my hand while leaving the station. the target is again 1.35...

I analyze the currency in several timeframes and I estimate lateral rank in M15 and M5, also I study the price action to H1. Afterwards, I estimate that the price action will probably release a bearish wave.  
I look forward to the opening of London, where the volume of transactions will increase significantly. I draw a small break line in M5 and I place a sell stop under that line and under the daily pivot.  
After the break, I add a short order more, after the correction of the break.  
In the end I lacked patience and I closed the positions ahead of time, with about 40 pips of profit.

In a market that I think is bearish, I have opened trades with some risk. Maybe I should wait for trades to be confirmed before entering the market. I should be more patient. Some trades are messy. I promise to improve from now on.

GJ H1  
In chart H1 an engulfing appears on a support. The most likely to arise a correction or retracement, important.

As I read from the Patron post, the important thing is to establish the market condition. The template does not matter nor does the method matter. In any case, I use 3 simple moving average, and the Macd (or any other oscillator, to suit the user), provides me with a complementary view of the Price. However, I do not use the indicators as a trigger, but I try to use the price action. In addition to the moving average, the pivots, the supports and the resistances, and the fibonaccis, they also help me to make decisions, looking for the highest odds in my favor. I also study the price in different timeframes.

EA is bearish, probably (see chart daily and H4). However, here the scalping has led me to a small trade for long.

EA daily  
I think that this chart gives reasons to think that the EA will be bearish next.  
A clear confirmation missing, but, anyway, smacks bearish.

EU m15  
The big picture of the EU makes me think that this currency pair is bearish. However, I thought there would be a 38% retracement of Fibonacci ... At the moment I have not succeeded here. This trade risky because it goes against the main trend, but I put a stoplosss very close to avoid large losses.

EA m5  
  
This trade has been closed in two phases. The first one closes 60% of the trade before the daily pivot. And the second, I hope to close it in the vicinity of the next resistance.
