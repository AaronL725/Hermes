Hi guys,  
  
I have corrected the template (MDTS) in POST#1.  
  
I forgot to change QQE on TF from 240 to 1440.

This is not a system... Its just a chart with indicators.  
A system would  
1\. have a system to enter and exit and manage risk.  
2\. Some test results to show it actually works.  
  
If you look at g/u monthly it dosn't seem to be trending much...   
been at this level 8 of the past 10 months at this level.. almost like its sorta ranging... 

The only system that will work is one designed by and for yourself.

Hi,  
  
Did you read the DOCX ?  
  
I take a trend from H4 for day trading. Taking the trend from monthly is too long for day trading.  
  
I have tested this system for a few months on M5. The results are pretty acceptable.  
  
Now I'm testing entering trades on M15. Let's see ...

Hi,  
  
I've just closed my trade GBPUSD for +20 pips  
  
  
The 4 conditions for SELL are validated and price is trading below the 20 EMA (H1) at the time of entry.  
  
\- SL@20 pips from the entry  
\- TP@20 pips from the entry  
  
RR: 1:1  
  
I entered a short trade on M15  
  
Have a nice day.  
Bye

Hi, Sriloba! Would you confirm - what are the settings of QQE - 240 or 1440? The 1 day settings /1440/ is it so long? I've understood the settings are for 4H - that's mean 240? Is there any mistake?

Hi,  
  
I use QQE (TF=1440) in H4 to determine trend. Because this parameter filter the noise of price action. So the trend lasts longer.  
  
  
You can use QQE(TF=240) in H1 to determine trend. So you will see the trend lasts longer.  
  
**To enter a trade on M15 I use macd Osma**  
  
So I have updated the template.

This system is using 2 graphics - 4H and 5 min and the correct settings - you have just written - are 1440 for QQE. But H1 we don't use in this system, isn't it? That' right?

I've entered in trade with the system today /H4and M5/ and I've earned 20 pips too on demo in the beginning of my test. I think there is a good perspective for the system - we'll see!

Hi,  
  
Yes. We use QQE(TF=1440) in H4 to determine the current trend.

Hi,  
  
  
Do the Demo first until you have confidence in the system then you can start live in micro account to put yourself in the water.

i'm using 15 min instead of 5 min,because 15min candle have few more pips than 1 min candle.we want to see more valid entries trades and charts to fool proof this strategy.

Hi, Sriloba! Would you share your opinion about improving the system? It will be better testing it and share the results starting in opening London session tomorow! Thanks in advance!

Hi, Sriloba! Today SL was reached because when I entered a trade H4 was orange /1440 settings/ but now is blue and it is the risk of MTF indicator if the trend is going to change in the exact moment. It is on M5 tpl. On M15 may be is better, but there wasn't any trade on GBPUSD in Friday. What do you think about the problem with MTF in defining the trend? Is there any other solution?

I saw the H4 gragh repainted several times during 8-12 a.m. and it is natural because it is 1440 settings /D1/. So, entering a trade we couldn't know where the main trend is going to go and we can make a mistake enter in such a trade when the trend is just changing. That is the basic problem - where is the direction of the main trend in the exact moment?   
You see that H4 on EURJPY pepainted again and it is orange now - that's why you manually closed the trade!

I usually look at canldes and zones too, the fist reason that I closed the trade was price couldnt brake the zone in 15min and then repainting, at first i thought it was taking liquidity too set new high but i was wrong and closed the trade

Hi, traders! On GBPUSD today - 2 entries on M15 - 10.00 and 11.00 GT - sell - 20 green pips. But on M5 - 7.10 GT - SL was reached. On M5 too - 9.25 GT - TP - 27 pips. So - M15 is saver than M5, or we have to filter better our trades on M5.  
Sorry, I can not share the chart, because I don't know how to do it. But everyone can see GBPUSD chart for himself and see the GT I just noticed.

Hi guys!!  
  
  
I'm still working on the filter based on H1.  
  
I have an idea how to improve the trade. Now I need some live test on a few trades  
  
You will get during this week or next week.  
  
Right now the 20 EMA on H1 gives us a pretty filter.  
  
Stay tune !

Hi,  
  
Because we set QQE(TF=1440, daily) H4. But don't worry.  
  
When I finish to test filter in H1 you will get more confident to take trades.

Hi,  
  
  
I missed the trades on GBPUSD. Because I fell asleep in my chair. You know it is very hard to trade during the London open when we live in North America.

Hi guys,  
  
  
I've just closed my trade (GBPUSD) by accident. Because I was trying to do a trailing stop that I want to share with you.  
  
I will make a doc for a trailing stop. It uses the breakout of the pattern Higher High (HH) or Lower Low (LL).  
  
By the way, I start trading at midnight Eastern Time until I get 20 pips as a daily goal.  
  
  
Stay tune!

Hi,  
  
You can use Daily chart QQE(TF=1440) to determine the trend.

So, entering a trade we couldn't know where the main trend is going to go and we can make a mistake enter in such a trade when the trend is just changing. That is the basic problem - where is the direction of the main trend in the exact moment? You see that H4 on EURJPY pepainted again and it is orange now - that's why you manually closed the trade!

Hi,   
  
  
  
Therefore use Daily chart to determine the trend or set QQE(TF=240) on H4.

Hi,  
  
  
If I were you I would not enter a trade. I will wait a new set up. 1) Price test the 5 ema (h1) of the low, 2) Force index (H1) is above zero, 3) macd is above zero.

Hi, traders! Today my results as I've promised to inform you: EURJPY - M15 Improved - BUY - 50 green pips /I used a trailing stop of 15 pips in the beginning and 10 pips later and it was touched/: USDCAD - M15 - SELL - 22 green pips. GBPUSD the first entry was so early in the morning and I missed it - 5.15 GT and then H4 was orange on D1 /1440 settings/ and our TP would be about 40 pips. But now H4 on D1 is blue and it REPAINTED from 8.00 till now. I didn't notice - what was the exact time when it repainted in blue - it is really significant, because from 15.00 till now the price moved UP more than 100 pips? So, all of us have to notice what is better: on H4 to remain on 1440 settings or to change H4 on 240 settings?! The direction of the main trend is the basic thing! I'm not sure jet what is better. For my entry I think M15 is better and clearer.   
What do you think?

Hi,  
  
Good trades!!  
  
We can tracking the direction of the market by using QQE(TF=240) in H4.  
  
No Problem. As long as we have a clear trend for intraday trading.  
  
Use M15 for entry. If you miss the first time of entry then you can reenter a trade by M5.

Hi, traders! Today: USDCAD - M15 - 20 green pips /this pair is not a volative one/ - it is a normal moving for it. But as you can see - EURJPY is still ranging - on M15 it couldn't still reach 20 pips /only 17 pips till now/. We have to wait and see what will happen, because for such a crosspair it is a normal movement over 30-40 pips in one direction. In my opinion the crosspairs are more risky to trade than the the basic USD pairs. GBPUSD is the best to trade, but today the first trade on M15 started in 5.00 GT - so early again and I missed it. On M5 - ther wasn't a clear signal for entry.

Today USDJPY - 10.30 GT there was a LONG entry - 24 pips lose till now. On H4 there was a clear long signal - on both 1440 and 240 settings - I don't understand - may be the UP trend is going to change, may be there are paiirs this system doesn't fit.....

Hi,  
  
I always check QQE(TF=240) in H1 to make sure the direction aligned with H4 if you use QQE(TF=1440 or 240) in H4.  
  
I call H1 the turning point.  
  
Sorry I forgot to mention in the DOC. Even I am a full time trader but I have a lot of things to do at home. It is crazy.

Hi, traders! Today - AUDUSD on M15 - 7.45 GT - SELL - but the price moved only 7 pips and changed in the oposite direction - I've closed with 15 pips lose. On GBPUSD there wasn't any entry on M15 or at M5. On EURUSD on M15 there was an unsure entry in 7.45 GT /the price just slightly touched the 5 EMA of the high/ and reentry in 14.00 on M5 with 30 green pips. The most sure entry in my opinion was on EURJPY on M15 in 6.45 and 7.45 GT with 70 pips in profit. USDCAD didn't make any correction to enter in trade.   
That is my statistic for today. We have to monitoring the trades only live, because QQE repaints during the movement of the price and it is natural because of the MTF indicator, but the trick in my opinion is to catch the accordance between the indicators in the 3 timeframes - H4-H1-M15 and to see how the system is working.

Hi guys,  
  
  
I have tested only 2 trades so far to enter a trade by using the TRAILING STOP.  
  
After 2 trades winners, I gained more confidence regarding the rhythm of the market.  
  
I think it is too soon to share with you. Let me do some more trades.  
  
Then I will share it with you.  
  
Stay tune!

Hi,  
  
  
Aligning QQE (H4 and H1) gives less signals. This is the concept of taking the same direction of the 2 TFs.  
  
Now, you can choose only the trend in the H4 then wait for price pulls back to the 5 EMA(H_L) finally, enter a trade in M15.  
  
This strategy gives more signals. The problem is we do not know when price changes the directions.  
  
That why the TRAILING STOP ENTRY will tell us more about the behavior of price action.  
  
We will see....

Hi guys,  
  
I've just closed GBPUSD with +23 pips.  
  
This is my third trade winner using the TRAILING STOP ENTRY.  
  
The trend is up on H4 and H1  
  
H1:  
  
1) Price touches the 5 EMA (low)  
2) Force index bar (Blue) is above zero  
Then go to M15 at the candle 8:00  
  
M15:  
  
Buy when the candle closes above the high of the previous candle.  If the price does not break above the high of the previous candle in the next 15 minute, this trigger level will move to the high of the next candle.  
The candle 8: 15, finally, closes above the high of the candle 2  
  
I will put it in doc this weekend  
  
Stay tune  
  
Have a nice weekend ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f3c4.png?v=15.1)

Hi, Sriloba! I can see a precised entry on these charts on M15 having in mind H-L of the previous candle before the entry candle. But I can not understand what do you mean TRAILING STOP ENTRY at this setup? Please, clear us! Thanks!

Hi,  
  
I use the concept of Dr Alexander Elder : The Triple screen.  
  
H4:  
He uses the trend following indicators for the long term screen to aid in identifying the trend.  
Here, we use QQE (FT=1440 or 240). For longer trend use QQE (TF=1440) or for use QQE(TF=240) for short trend. Because you will see the direction changes often.  
  
**GBPUSD is up in H4**  
  
HI:  
He uses the oscillators for the intermediate term to help know when a pullback is in place.  
Our task is to try to determine just when to enter. We would like to know when the retracement is complete and the prevailing trend will continue.  
We use Force Index(2 EMA, close).  
  
**GBPUSD retraces to the 5 ema(low). Then the candle (7:00 GMT) closes with Force Index bar above the zero (Blue). This indicates the pullback is finished. Then we go to M15 to BUY.**  
  
M15:  
  
We buy the GBPUSD by using the breakout of the previous high.  
The chart below, M15, shows the candle 2 (8:00) did not break the previous high the candle 1. So we check the next candle of 15 minutes to form.  
Now the candle 3 breaks the high of the candle 2. We enter a BUY trade at the candle 3 closes. This technic calls the **TRAILING STOP ENTRY.**  
  
Hope this can help you.  
  
  
Sai Ram

Thanks, Sriloba for your quick and clear responce. But I've noticed that on M15 MACD histogram bar on candle 2 is orange - then there is no matter the level of its close /higher or lower to the tpevious one - candle 1/, because we need first the histogram to become blue in order to enter a LONG trade. We have to enter after the candle 3 closes, because the first blue bar was formed.   
May be you mean - if this candle 3 had closed lower than the candle 2 /when the signal really was formed/, then we have to wait to the next candle to close higher to enter a LONG trade. Is it so? Thanks in advance!

Hi guys,  
  
My trade GBPUSD is stopped out by using a trailing stop.  
  
After I got +9 pips I put SL@1.2676 and TP@22 pips from entry and went to bed.  
  
The trend is down and only looking to sell in LTF.  
  
I will share with you the new improvement of the MDTS very soon.  
  
The improvement is aligning the trend H4 ( the cross of 5/10 EMA, I like so much) with the trend H1( QQE is above/below 50 level).  
And enter a trade in M15. (See the second chart in black attached below)  
  
Stay tune!

Thank you, Sriloba! We'll try and see......the first or the second improvement is a better one! GBPUSD is still ranging from 8.15 GT till now - but we'll see when breaking higer or lower - we are testing now.

Hi,  
  
I like the second one. Because I have used more than 10 years the cross of 5/10 EMA to determine the current trend on H4.  
  
Then, for the first time, I use QQE on H1 to analyze the medium current trend aligning with the one on H4. It is powerful for the high probability of trade.  
  
Also, I think the interval of using time frames is the factor of 4 (H4_H1_M15) is helping to analyze top-down accurately.

Then, for the first time, I use QQE on H1 to analyze the medium current trend aligning with the one on H4. It is powerful for the high probability of trade. Also, I think the interval of using time frames is the factor of 4 (H4_H1_M15) is helping to analyze top-down accurately. Sai Ram

Hi, I'd like to share - GBPUSD - the first improved system - 8.00 GT - SELL - 20 green pips. I'm waiting for the next entry on the second improved system - we have a SELL signal on H4 now - waiting after a corection on MACD on M15 /it is a blue histogram now/, MACD to become a red one.

Hi,  
  
I've closed GBPUSD with +9 pips.  
  
Last night, I went sell on GBPUSD for 40 pips as TAKING PROFIT and went to bed. I think I was so greedy. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f910.png?v=15.1)

Dear traders, in my opinion, it is necessary a candle on H1 not only to touch the H_L of 5 EMA, but to CLOSE over or under this EMA in order the entry to be confirmed - BUY or SELL. Sometimes Stoch on H4 is giving us a late signal - it is showing us the correction of the price - not just the entry. So, we have to think over the settings of this Stoch in order to correlate the indicators. What do you think about this?

Hi,  
  
The stochastic in H4 is there just for confirming the cross of 5/10 EMA. And also we need the stoch in M15 to confirm the entry.  
  
If your entry in M15, let say downtrend, price trades below the 20 ema(H1) then there is a high probability trade.  
  
In a downtrend, for instance, we need price touching the 5 ema(H1) of the high and also we need Macd histogram (M15) going above the zero level for a high probability of trade. Then we have a full retracement of price action. That for we need so much before entering a trade.

At 8.00 GT GBPUSD on H4 Stoch was blue, but we had a very nice entry on M15 - SELL with abot 20 pips profit, that's why I think the Stoch on H4 is a bit late.

Hi,  
  
Yes, I see. I want you to concentrate to align the direction of H4 and H1 first of all.  
  
Then enter a trade in M15 after price action makes a maximum of retracement by watching the price touches to the 5 ema (H1) of the High/Low and Macd histogram(M15) goes above/below the zero level before you pull the trigger.

It was a very long sell candle - of about 20 pipis long. So, it's better to stay away from such a trade or we have to be ready to put a bit higher SL, having in mind this long candle. I entered in the same trade, but my SL is higher - so I'm still waiting for the finishing of this trade. 20 pips is impossible to put SL in every trade - it depends of the exact trade, I think. For the present - the price is ranging too like yesterday. But USDCHF was a perfect setup at 7.00 GT - BUY - 20 green pips , now I'm waiting for a second entry. USDJPY is a possible entry too - I'm waiting now - BUY entry.

Hi,  
  
Right. You see my big mistake. I had toll people in the past not to enter a trade after a long body candlestick formed. Because, by nature, the price will retrace.

3) stochastic trending up + Force Index(H1) is positive

Thank you, Sriloba for sharing the system - I think it is a very nice strategy. Are you still testing it on demo or are you trading on real account with it? I'm not sure for myself what to do. There is nobody /eccept you/ to share the results - then the decision will be easiier.

Don't waste to much time in the demo. Begin with a micro account then increase lots according to the risk management.

Always put a stop loss at the most recent high or low. In this case, I decided to put the stop loss 6 pips from the entry.  
  
Because I saw the Hammer formed, in H4, at the bottom of the downtrend. Maybe the trend reverses.

That's why, as I have already written, watching the graghs, I noticed on H1: the candle MUST CLOSE over /for sell/ or under /for buy/ 5 EMA /H_L/. It is not enough to touch the 5 EMA - it is risky. In 9.00 GT GBPUSD just closed a candle over 5 EMA - high and price begins to fall down - we'll see what will happen - is this theory right?! Again the candle on M15 is very long, it will probably retrace, but I think entrance in 10.15 GT is better. If you add a MBFX indicator - I think it is very significant to see where is its direction on H1 and M30 in order to take a decision to enter or not on M15. On 9.15 when you entered in a trade MBFX on M30 was in the oposite direction - would you see?   
Sorry, I can't share a picture, I don't know how to share, but just add this indi and watch what is happening.

I've just finished - GBPUSD - SELL - 20 green and quick pips - I think the system is working, but we have to precise on H1 when the retracemrnt is finished and then enter on M15 - it is very significant in my opinion!

Hi,  
  
  
For a maximum retracement, we have to wait for the price closes above or below the 5 EMA(H1) high/low.  
  
Then crank down to M15 to enter a trade with the confirmations.  
  
I have done some paper trades. The results are much better than before.  
  
It is too late to take a trade at this hour. London session comes to an end in an hour.

Standing in front of the computer and monitoring the price I have noticed that a H1 retracement is very significant and we have to be more patient in waiting a candle to close above or below the 5 EMA /H_L/ on H1. That's why I'm using MBFX timing indicator with default settings for a conformation that the retracement is finishing and the price is entering in the main H4 direction. If on H1 and even M30 we can not see any change of this direction /by yellow or the new color of MBFX/ - then we have to stay away of entering in a trade, even we have an entry signal on M15. Then we have to wait to the next M15 entry. A H1 timeframe is very significant - otherwise we are going to risk and our SL will be touched.  
MBFX timing indicator is only a suggestion of mine - may be there is a better indicator for confirmation to give us a better clearness the retracement was finished on H1 in order to continue with our entry on M15. If you have a better solution - lets see and improve it. I'll be happy everyone to share here!  
Have a nice weekend!

Hi,  
  
  
Wow!!  
  
I like your ideas! When doing top-down analysis from H4 to M15 ones must see the behaviors of price action in the interval of time frames. That's why price action  
  
move in the H1 is significant. Never do the contrary in H1. All time frames must say the same thing.  
  
If M15 is a whipsaw for accurate entry then use M30 to trigger. There is no problem. This might be a solution for an entry point.

Hi,  
  
I've just closed manually GBPUSD +10 pips. Because NEW will release at 11:30 GMT.  
  
H4: Trend is up  
  
H4 and H1 are aligned  
  
H1: Price closes below the 5 ema of the low  
  
M15: Go LONG when ALF Winner is below 0 level and cross back above 0 level (white bar) + Force Index (H1) is positive  
  
  
My friend just sent me ALF Winner to put in M15 for confirmation.  
  
  
Hope I will grab 10 more pips to achieve my daily objective (20 pips)

This indicator is giving us an earlier signal, I see, than MACD - we'll see is it better with ALF or with MACD?

Hi,  
  
Be careful. The stop loss is the risk of each of your trade. How much you are willing to risk for this trade?  
  
I don't risk 3 to 5% of capital on each trade. Every time you enter a trade it is a risk.  
  
Because the indicators compute the past data to project in the future. So the past data don't give always 100% accurate.

I risk not more then 2% of the capital. But GBPUSD is a volative pair - in many cases it's impossible our SL to be maximum 20 pips - it depends of the movement. Today I didn't enter on real account, because: 1. It's Monday - the new week is starting. 2. MBFX didn't fall under 30 level as I've already written - I was not sure enough. The H1 timeframe is a key timeframe before enter on M15.

There is a setup to go LONG as shown on the chart attached below.   
  
But I did not take it because it is close to the NEWS releases on 17:00 GMT.

I think it is the real setup after the retracement on H1 has finised. In my opinion there is no mater the news are coming, because they are with a medium impack. The news are the moving force of the price and I think there is no problem /except non farm pay rolls, lets say and other with a high significance/. But most of the traders prefer to stay away from such a risk - in some cases it is beter to surf the wave of the movement, but on the other side it is beter to stay apart from trading.  
There is no a perfect formula.

I've just closed GBPUSD to breakeven, because as I've already said I've entered at the previous setup, but the price continued to retrace. So, in an hour London is going to close, the movement is not so intensive in that hour and I think it is beter not to risk to wait for a more profit. I'm still waiting for EURUSD with a trailing stop, but I am in profit now - these are the second and third entries and if the trend will return - I will be in about 22 pips profit. We'll see till when the trend will continue.  
In several words - The system is working, but we have to be carefull till when the retracement is finishing on H1 and in the exact moment to enter on M15.

Hi guys,  
  
  
The system is 90% providing us a hedge. So I'm going to give you the following tip.  
  
The interval of time frames to do the analysis is very important.  
  
I choose H4-H1-M15. Because the Hedges Funds pinpoint their entries on H4. So we, as dumb money, can ride with the Big Boys.  
  
So it is very primordial that the 3-time frames go in the same direction.  
  
After saying that you can make your own system with your favorite indicators. So your confidence will eliminate the doubt when come to take a trade.  
  
Or you can take the MDTS and modify it according to your personality.  
  
Hope you understand.

Yes, I understand, Sriloba! Thank you very much for sharing the system, the opinion and for your wise advices. I really have learned so much here, analyzing togather, you gave me a solid basis in my learning about price action.   
My total profit was 105 green pips today. But I'm still analyzing and testing in order to achieve stable results every day - the minimum of 20 pips it will be a success for me.

Hi, As I promised to share the results: at 11 GT I've entered in a BUY trade - GBPUSD - I've took my minimum of 20 green pips. The other 2 trades closed to breakeven - I didn't want to risk with lower SL. Otherwise it would be 40 pips in my direction, but never mind - my system is 20 sure pips, the others - to breakeven. It's not bad! So, I'm glad to share - another day the system is confirming itself.

Today USDJPY - SELL - would be a losing trade, because it is still retracing up, but there was a perfect setup at 11.00 GT for SELL. That's why it is necessary to work over confirming the H1 in order to know the finishing of retracement. Everyone can see what happened!

Hi,  
  
I missed GBPUSD trade alerted at 12:15 GMT. Because I have slept in my chair.  
  
**H4:** Uptrend  
  
**H1:** QQE is above zero. Price closes below 5 EMA (Low).  
**H4 and H1 are aligned.**  
  
**M15:** Go LONG when TIMING goes below zero and cross back above zero and Blue + Force Index (H1) is above zero  
  
It is very hard to stay awake during the London Session when living in North America.  
  
I'm trying to find the indicator that can timing the entry.  
  
Now, M15, I have in my tools box ( MACD, ALF Winner, MBFX Timing)

I think MBFX timing indicator is very usefull most of all to determine the finfshing of the retracement on H1 - when apears an yellow color it is a sign that the price is coming to change in the oposite direction, i.e. the retracement is over. Monitoring the price nearly all the day I've noticed that this is exclusively significant.

Hi,  
  
I have in my tools box one more way to enter a trade in M15, the pattern **HH-LL**.  
  
I will share it with you.  
  
You can check on this website: [https://www.babypips.com/trading/hap...intro-20180105](https://www.babypips.com/trading/happy-pip-mech-system-intro-20180105)  
  
I have read it twice. And I found very interesting.  
  
I have modified the timing entry to fit my personality. The author uses the **PENDING ORDER** to enter a trade. I use the **BREAKOUT after the candle closes** then enter a trade.  
  
Just give me time to download from charts.  
  
  
Stay tuned!

I see .....on M15 I see the formation after the retracement of several down candles I see the first up candle is forming LH and LL at 10.00 GT, 13.30 GT. That is meaning - the entry will be so earlier..... That's good, but is this formation for sure?

Hi,  
  
I'm trying to explain using the pattern **Lower Lows (LL)** to go LONG.  
  
M15:  
  
1) The candles (1,2) forms a pattern LL. Then the candle (2) is a signal bar. The high of the candle (1) serves as a breakout for entry.  
  
2) Make sure that the 4 previous lows of candles are higher than the low of the signal bar (2)  
  
3) Wait for the candle closes above, or a breakout, of the high of a candle (1).  
  
4) Then Go LONG on the next open candle + Force Index(H1) is above the zero line.  
  
  
Hope I don't confuse you. But you go to read this website:[https://www.babypips.com/trading/hap...intro-20180105](https://www.babypips.com/trading/happy-pip-mech-system-intro-20180105)

But the High of the signal Candle 2 is lower than you show us - you show the High of candle 1 - it is not the signal candle.

The main trend is UP - we see on H4. We are waiting for a retracement on H1 - a candle to close BELOW 5 EMA-LOW /the red line/. A candle is only touching the 5 EMA - low . So, it is risky to enter after only the touching, because the retracement may be not fullfilled at all. In this example, the price moved UP extremely. But we have to remember - it is a cross pair, the rules of the system are not for sure, because every cross consists of 2 basic pairs and the movement is complicate. I myself prefer to wait for a full retracement and I'm so carefull with crosses.

Hi,  
  
The right entry according to the rule is followed:  
  
The candle (1,2) formed a LL pattern. The Candle (2) is a signal bar and the high of the candle (1) serves as an entry.  
  
The price must break out the high of the candle (1). Then enter LONG on the next open candle.  
  
H1: The price was rejected the 20 EMA. ( acceptable)**_I prefer the candle closes below the 5 ema (LOW)._**

Hi,  
  
  
I went LONG on CHFJPY. But it is stopped out with +2pips.  
  
Why +2 pips? After I gained 5 pips I put an SL@ 2 pips from the entry. And I went to rest for a while.  
  
H4: Uptrend  
  
H1: Price closed below the 5 ema (LOW); H4 and H1 are aligned.  
  
M15:  
  
The candle (1,2) formed an IB (Inside Bar). The candle (2) is a signal bar.  
  
Also the low the 4 previous candles must higher the low of the signal bar.  
  
The price must break out the high the candle (1). Then go LONG on the next open candle.

20 EMA or 26 EMA? In the latest templ is 26 EMA. Is it a mistake?

There is a good setup SELL entry USDCAD. I've just put a trade. We'll see...... I was late with 3 pips, but the significant is the direction - that is I want to see.

Hi,  
  
26 EMA for a test. Why is that?  
  
Because MACD(12,26,9) ===>**12 ema, 26 ema, 9 sma**  
  
If price trades above 26 ema (H1) then the market is an uptrend. It is just a filter to align with the trend from H4.  
  
I am going to let the 26 EMA stays in H1 for some time. Then I will see if it is worth to consider the 26 EMA as a filter in H1.

Hi,  
  
I saw it. But I don't like the LOONIE even I am Canadian.   
  
Every time it moves is like the Loonie jumps 5, 6 or 7 pips then pull back.

Hi,  
  
I went LONG on GBPUSD, Take Profit at 20 pips from the entry. Then exited manually for break even.  
  
  
H4: Uptrend  
  
H1: H1 and H4 are aligned. Price was rejected on the 26 EMA (H1). When I saw this move then I decided to take this setup.  
  
But the pair moved a little bit upward then dropped like a stone. So I decided to exit a trade with a break even.

It is not enough the price close above or below the 5 EMA - L_H, but as I saw it is necessary the price to touch the 26 EMA. USDCAD just closed with 25 pips loss, because I didn't have in mind that rules.

Hi,  
  
I think we have a solid technic analysis. But what we need is the fundamental analysis to complete the whole analysis.  
  
What forces drive the markets?  
  
The fundamental analysis creates direction while the technic analysis gives the way to enter a trade.

I noticed something very interesting - if we have the formation H_L 2 candles on H1 - then we can enter by the same formation of the upper rules on M15 and the probability is very high - I have noticed on the historical data. Now you can see the same on EURJPY - we have the formation on H1 and I'm waiting on M15 - a candle to close over 121.735 - let's see what will happen...... I know that it is not easy to find that formation first on H1 - then to wait on M15, but if the probability is very high - it will be exellent. In the original site I've read that this formation is looking for in higher timeframes - H1 and H4. So, there is a logic thing.

Hi,  
  
These are the 4 pairs that I trade during the London session.  
  
If the price closes below the yellow horizontal line in H4 then the trend changes.  
  
The MAs will follow later. Because they are lagging.

How are you going to trade? You mean:  
1\. To determine the trend on H4 by the formation which is a pure price action, because MAs are lagging and to reject the indicators on H4.  
2\. Are you going to wait for the same H_L formation on H1? and  
3\. Enter on M15; or are you going to enter on the same formation on H1 directly.   
Would you explain what do you mean, please! Thanks!

Hi,  
  
I trade both, Price Action (PA) and MAs. Some time lagging provides precious information.  
  
For instance, the trend changes direction in H4 by observing the PA. But the cross of MAs is not yet.  
  
But we can see in H1 the momentum of the market by observing the PA trade above or below the 26 EMA and QQE cross above or below 50 level.  
  
By the way, the QQE uses MA inside the algorithm also.  
  
These are a clue that we can use them to do the analysis.  
  
Regarding the HH-LL formed in H1, we can use it to pinpoint in M15.  
  
Tonight, I hope that I can show by live trade.  
  
I will show later. Let me find the perfect example.

Hi,  
  
Here is an example to sell the pair by using the setup formed in H1.  
  
GBPUSD  
  
H4: Downtrend --- 5/10 ema cross down  
  
H1: QQE is trading below 50 Level (bearish); H4 and H1 are aligned. Price closes above 5 ema (high), candle(2).  
  
The candles (1,2) formed the pattern Higher High (HH). The candle (1) is a signal bar and the low of the candle(2) serves as the breakout.  
  
**The high of the 4 previous candles are lower than the high of the signal bar. (very important, if we want a maximum retracement)**  
  
On the candle(3), we go to M15 to pinpoint the trade. We wait for the candle in M15 to break below the low of the candle 2 in H1 and confirmed by  
  
Force Index (H1) is below zero line. Finally, sell the pair on the next open candle.  
  
Hope I don‛t confuse you.

Thanks, Sriloba! I understand what do you mean - H4 is better to determine the trend by the MAs, then go to H1 and see the H_L formation and when we have a setup on H1 again to see the confirmed H4 trend. Then go to M15, but the breakline of the H1 formation remain to the gragh of M15 - not the break of M15 formation, but the breakout of H1. It is really clever - let see when London is starting is the modified system confirmed. It would be wonderfull - all of us are hoping to discover the key. All the time I believe that the link between the timeframes is this key.

Hi, the main trend on H4 changed 2 times today. May be there were news with high impack. On GBPUSD there was no entry setup, but on AUDUSD the setup for SELL didn't work and I lost again with this pair. May be the system is suitable mainly for GBPUSD.

Hi,  
  
We can not do anything regarding the NEWS.  
  
What we can do is doing the analysis of the new direction.

The positive thing of the system is that we are safe of enter in a losing trade for GBPUSD, because while price was DOWN on H4 we didn't have a DOWN setup on H1. Now the trend on H4 ia changing and if remain UP, then we have to wait for a new setup for BUY on H1. That is in my opinion. But we saw that the system is not such confirming for the other pairs - may be it is really suitable mainly for GBP. We'll see.....

Hi,  
  
When I create the system I use GBPUSD to make the tests. This is a pair that I traded for more than 8 years. Because we can grab 20 pips in 1 trade.  
  
I think we can trade others pair with the system. The problem is each pair has its own characteristics.   
  
This is my point of view.

You are absolutely right! Every pair has its own specific movement. I think everyone may choose one or two pairs in order to learn in details every element of their movement, because it is impossible to trade precisely several pairs in one and the same time. I'm trading more than 2 pairs, because I'm still testing . But in the real account it is not necessary to risk too much. I agree with you that GBPUSD is a volative pair and it is real possible to grab minimum 20 pips today.

Hi fellow traders,  
  
I want to share with you the MDTS simplified. It is very easy to follow. Even the newbies don't have to take time to absorb the idea.  
  
The system contains 3 parts:  
  
1) Determining the trend in H4  
  
2) Wait for the retracement in H1  
  
3) Aligning the 3 Forces in M15 then pulling the trigger with a quiet mind.  
  
Enjoy it!

Hi, Sriloba! Thanks for sharing the latest simple and easy to follow system. But testing it in historical data I found several losing setups /for example GBPUSD - 03.06.19 - H4 - 06.00 GT- BUY; H1 - 06.00 GT-retracement DOWN; M15 - 08.00 GT at close - ENTRY BUY. We see the price moved 17 pips in our direction and then 32 pips against us. If we have put our 20 sure pips TP - our SL would be touched for sure.   
I have a suggestion: to add CCI on H1 - it shows us where retracement had already finished. The same gragh: on H1 at 13.00 GT we can see CCI is under -100 level and then we can go to M15 at 14.30 GT and it will be better - with 40 green pips.  
I mean - CCI will filtrate better on H1. We must to have in mind too - it doesn't repaint - it is an indi for sure.  
I myself have already added CCI on H1 for filtration.

Hi,  
  
  
You can enter a trade from H1 to M15.   
  
The Stop Loss wides with the time frame.  
  
Always calculate the risk (Stop Loss) when entering a trade.  
  
The new template is completed to trade from H4 to M15.

Hi,  
  
  
I use most of the time the strategy in post#132.  
  
The system is accurate 80%.  
  
I trade GBPUSD at 95%. My daily objective is 20 pips.  
  
Start with the majors.

You are posting different pairs - take a look! H4 - GBPUSD, but H1 and M15 - EURUSD! Be carefull!

Hi fellow traders,  
  
If your entry, M15 is whipsawed, you can go up a one-time frame.  
  
For day to day trading, it is wise to enter a trade, not below H1. M30 is borderline.

Which system have you in mind? For H1 entry we have to sacrifice green pips. I think it is not necessary - it is better after a good analising to enter at smaller timeframes.

Hi,  
  
  
You said IS SELL entry is timing. I assume that you saw the Fxtrendband in H4 is developing a bearish bar. But the current candle was not closed yet.  
  
You have to wait for the current in H4 closed then you decide your entry in M15 goes in the same direction in H4 (Prevailing trend).

Hi,  
  
H4 is down.  
  
Wait for Force Index bar (H1) closes above the zero. (Pull back)  
  
Then go to M30 to wait for the Higher High (HH) formed then study the key level of entry for SELL TRADE.  
  
Finally, go to M15 to wait for price breaks below the key level of M30 then you can pull the trigger with a quiet mind.  
  
Go to **POST** #**132** to learn the entry strategy.  
  
_**THIS POST IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ANALYZE THE HIGH PROBABILITY OF ENTRY**_  
  
  
I will post an example with charts

But we see several black bars on H4 had closed - so the main trend is down. And I can't understand what we have to wait and till when? Would you clear, please, beacause I'm confused too! Would you explain in details the latest version, Sriloba, please! Thanks!

I'm a little confused.  
  
If I follow your instructions into the MTDS_simplified.doc document, you said:  
  
1) Determining the trend with the H4 timeframe.  
  
2) Wait for the retracement with the H1 timeframe.  
  
3) Enter a trade with the M15 timeframe.  
  
On the picture below could you tell me if I can enter a trade on M15 on the 2 red vertical bar (H4 timeframe) or only on the first red vertical bar?

Hi,  
  
  
GBPUSD  
  
  
H4: The trend is DOWN  
  
H1: I wait for Force Index bar closes above the zero (GREEN) ---- ( Pull back )  
  
M30: I will wait for HH formed. Then I will study the key level of SELL TRADE.  
  
M15: I will wait for price closes below the key level found in M30. Then I will pull the trigger with a high probability of trade.  
  
This is my analysis. If the signal alert occurs close to the London session end then I will not enter a sell trade.  
  
This model of charts might help me to increase the high probability of entry in M15 (especially). I will see ...

If I follow your instructions into the MTDS_simplified.doc document, you said: 1) Determining the trend with the H4 timeframe. 2) Wait for the retracement with the H1 timeframe. 3) Enter a trade with the M15 timeframe. On the picture below could you tell me if I can enter a trade on M15 on the 2 red vertical bar (H4 timeframe) or only on the first red vertical bar? {image}

Ok for the H4 and H1 charts, I understood.  
  
But for the M30 chart we wait what (if the H4 and H1 charts are confirmed)? Could you post an example of this M30 chart condition?

It is 11:13 ET  
  
London is about to close. The volatility is slow.  
  
  
I trade GBPUSD 95% of the time then EURJPY, EURUSD and AUDUSD

Hi, traders! The entry setup on exampled gragh would be easier to analize and to take a decision for BUY ENTRY if you add a CCI indicator. The exact moment is confirmed by -100 level and the 3 Force indicators - H4,H1 and M15. Try it and see!

Natasha,   
why don't you post a chart to illustrate your point? (what CCI indicator, what is the value of the CCI indi you have in mind, what does -100 confirm - end of pullback?)  
Thank you.

I'm very sorry, but I don't know how to paste a chart as an image in order to illustrate. CCI with default settings /14/ I use in order to see where the retracement is finishing /levels 100 and -100/ - only on H1 and M30. To enter on M15 I use the confirmation of force histograms.

Sorry, I've just already written that I don't know how to do it technically. But you can add a standart CCI indi with default settings and see where the retracement just finished. It is for confirming.

Hi,  
  
  
Today I went LONG on EURUSD. It's still running.  
  
H4: The trend was up  
  
H1 and M30: CCI was below -100 (oversold)-- We need CCI, only H1 or M30, is oversold --- pullback that we want  
  
M15: Enter LONG when the 3 Forces agreed  
  
TP at 20 pips from the entry, the trade is protected by SL(2 pips)  
  
Let's see ...

Right click on the chart, look at the lower part of the dialogue box that will open, you;ll see the option of "save as picture", click OK and the image of the chart will be saved in your folder where you normally save files by default.

Hi,  
  
  
I decided to close manually EURUSD with +10 pips.  
  
London is closed. The market is very slow.  
  
Hope tomorrow the trade will be successful.

Hi,  
  
I just want to remind you a few things on the path of forex trading.  
  
The DEMO is only to learn the MetaTrader.  
  
Use the micro account for testing the strategy. I, personally, use a micro lot of live account to test the new indicator or new system. With a micro lot and risk  
  
management, we are not going to destroy the whole account.  
  
Trading for a living, I, personally, use 1000$ to start and increase fund gradually to reach 7500$.  
  
I risk 3-5% of my initial capital. 5% is too much but if we have a system with 75-80% of the hedge then there is no fear of trading.  
  
  
This is my experience.

It is impossible so many pairs on one monitor - you may use two computors or you have to swith between several pairs, like I do that.

Today several succesful trades: GBPUSD - early in the morning; USDCHF; USDCAD; GBPJPY. I've traded only GBPJPY, the others I missed.   
The main problem in trading the system, in my opinion is: everyone to take a care: when CCI is showing us the retracement is over on H1 and we have the alignment of the 3 force indicators on M15 - be carefull in the exact moment not to change the main trend on H4. Otherwise the system is exellent.

Hi,  
  
  
If it is hard to align the 3 Forces then I have something alternative to use.  
  
It is a system that I was using 10 years ago and, now, I have to implement the alignment.   
  
Now I'm testing in a live account for a few trades then I will share with you.  
  
Stay tuned!

Hi, Sriloba,  
I found the indicator(under the 15m chart, H4 force mod line, it moved down zero and after several bars, it moved back.) repainted, is this normal?  
  
Thanks!

I agree with you, Sriloba! I've found it is really difficult to align the 3 forces, because of MTF - they repaint - it is normal. That's why it's necessary to use an indicator not MTF for M15 in order to confirm the entry for sure.

Hi,  
  
  
If you don't like MTF_XXX indicator you can confirm in the time frame itself (H4_H1).

The problem of the MTF indicators is that while we are waiting the confirmation the pips were blown. Never mind how we are choosing to use them - on H4 there are 4 hours period, while we have to wait to confirm.

Hi,  
  
Here is the system I'm testing.  
  
H4: Trend  
-5/10 cross up and confirmed by RSI is above 50 and Stochastic cross up  
  
H1 or M30: Waiting for a maximum of pullback  
-CCI must be below -100  
  
M15: Trigger  
1) 5/10 cross up and confirmed by the points followed below:  
2) RSI(H4) is above 50  
3) RSI(H1) is above 50  
4) RSI(M15) is above 50  
5) Stoch cross up  
6) Macd Histogram is below zero then increase value.  
  
Buy= 1)+2)+3)+4)+5)+6)

Hi,  
  
  
I think the last system_RSI Filter that we are testing seems to be much better than the system_Forces Filter.

It would be more safer the retracement on H1 to reach up to 100 level. Yes, we see a retracement on M30, but in my opinion it is a bit risky.

GBPJPY - it is better - we see CCI up to 100 level - it's time to watch it near and be ready for entry

Hi,  
  
The system that I was using 10 years ago called Cowabunga.  
  
You can find in this website:[https://www.babypips.com/trading/so_...d_the_school_o](https://www.babypips.com/trading/so_youve_finished_the_school_o)  
  
You can learn yourself the whole system written by the author.  
  
I had modified a lot some parts of the system to fit my personality.  
  
Until I found the 3 screens of Alexander Elder system.  
  
What I did on the Cowabunga system is implementing the alignment. I had use HA, QQE, Stochastic, MAs, Forces as an alignment. Those alignments improved my  
  
trades significantly in the past years. But I did not test with RSI until last week.   
  
I use RSI(9) from H4_H1_M15 to align in the same direction combined with other indicators. I found the results were better.   
  
I will see some more trades.

Thank you, Sriloba for your sharing. I think the system is very promissing now - I mean this latest version. I will test it too and share to everyone who is interested in. GBPJPY really moved 22 pips in our SHORT direction. USDCHF, USDCAD - LONG - about 17 - 20 green pips - it seems really promissing - we'll see when LONDON opens.

Hi,  
  
  
If you have a doubt on the Cowabunga system please feel free to ask in this thread.  
  
Because I had read it a million time during my first 3 years of trading.  
  
You have to understand properly the entry in M15, especially Macd histogram.  
  
Because the trade GBPJPY that you have taken you have broken the rule.  
  
Anyway, the rules are here to be broken as the author said.

Yes, I understand what do you mean - on M15 - MACD has JUST to BEGIN to increase its value /for BUY/. Otherwise we may consider that the price is possible already had running out, it had exhausted. Thank you for your notice, I didn't make a serious sense. But it is a part of the system and I must have in mind! Because in other cases it may be of a great significance.  
Thank you.

Hi,  
  
  
Your understanding is fast.  
  
When we follow strictly the rules we can save some bad trades. Also, Macd serves as a good filter.  
  
But if you don't like Macd as a filter I have something in mind for the entry in M15.  
  
Let me show you.  
  
H4: Downtrend  
  
M15:  
1) wait for price breaks above 5 ema_high (H1)  
2) At the same time, CCI is above 100  
Sell when :  
3) Price breaks below 20 EMA  
4) RSI(H4) is below 50  
5) RSI(H1) is below 50  
6) RSI(M15) is below 50  
7) Stochastic is trending down

Hi, but the conditions for a full retracement on H1 were not fullfiled - CCI didn't reach 100 level neigther on H1, nor on M30. Conditions are met by the original Cowabunga system, which has no in mind the H1 retracement. I think it will be better for us to consider H1 retracement in order to have a higher probability.  
In your case the results are exellent and it's OK, but we have to test the system in the both cases - with and without retracement on H1 in order to be more ensured in trading.

Hi,  
  
I used the template in POST#236. Because there is no Macd. And Macd might make people more confused.  
  
If you want a full retracement occurred in H1 it is ok. But there are fewer signals.  
  
That's why the template in POST#236 will give us more reliable signals alert.  
  
Cowabunga system uses H4 (trend) and M15(entry). I have tested it. The results were not I expected. That's why I had modified a lot, alignment, improved entry  
  
signal, etc...). But I like to use 5/10 EMAs from the Cowabunga system to determine the trend in H4 and this stays in my tools box more than 10 years.

What do you mean - to use the H1 retracement or not? Because in your latest template without MACD /post 236/ is not shown H1 gragh, but I think it is necessary to include it in our analizing before to swith on M15 - I think the setups will be more reliabe than if we haven't in mind H1.

I think the most significant think in our discusion is whether to use the retracement on H1 , because the higher graghs are very important. It is not of a great matter whether to include MACD or not, because you have already included and few other indicators to confirm entry on M15. And all these indicators are reliable I think. Before entry on M15 I think we have to reslve the problem to use or not H1 - CCI retracement, because it will reflect to our exact entry on M15 and so - to our final results.

Hi,  
  
I use 5 EMA High/Low in H1 as support and resistant. And this gives me pretty ideas in my analysis.  
  
We can use the behaviors CCI (H1) to track how far the price may move.

Hi,  
  
Last night, I went SHORT on GBPUSD. When my trade went +10 pips I put SL +3 pips and TP@20 pips from the entry went to bed.  
  
In the morning I got up and my trade was stopped with +3 pips.  
  
All the SELL conditions were validated.

Hi, traders! Today my results: SELL - GBPUSD - 20 pips; GBPJPY - 24 pips; EURJPY - 20 pips; EURUSD - 10 pips /the setup was too late - 1 hour before London closing and I manually closed the trade/. But the most significant is that I was waited for the full retracement on H1 - CCI -100 or -100 level.

Hi,  
  
The strategy in POST246 is inspired by the other strategy known as Quattro Cash Envelopes that I found on the internet.  
  
I have tested the Quattro Cash Envelopes. I don't like Envelope and RSI indicator.  
  
I think the strategy in POST246 is better than the Quattro Cash Envelopes.  
  
The CCI in H1 is good when the market is ranging and slow. But if the market is fast RSI won't go to the extreme.  
  
I attach below the pdf of Quattro Cash Envelopes.

Thanks Sriloba for sharing! IBut I can not understand what do you surch on H1? If you don't wait for a retracement on H1, then what??? I agree that if the market is fast we may enter on M30, even on M15 CCI levels, but the problem is we never know what would be the market in advance. I've tried to enter on M30 CCI level, even on M15 - sometimes, but the results are not reliable.   
What is your opinion and what do you suggest? May be it's better the setups be fewer but reliable, than to enter risky.

I agree that if the market is fast we may enter on M30, even on M15 CCI levels, but the problem is we never know what would be the market in advance. I've tried to enter on M30 CCI level, even on M15 - sometimes, but the results are not reliable. What is your opinion and what do you suggest? May be it's better the setups be fewer but reliable, than to enter risky.

Hi,  
  
It is very hard to get good timing from the indicators, especially when we deal in lower time frames such as M15 and lower.  
  
Now, what you can do is looking at the Support and Resistance in a higher time frame and do the studies of Fibonacci on H1 data.  
  
See if there is a confluence of events. If there is then at that point of confluence of events represents a key level serves as S/R.  
  
My strategy contains 3 parts:  
  
1) Determining the current trend on H4  
  
2) H1: Looking for a retracement, if there is, or serves as a medium trend. if H4 and H1 are in the same direction then we can hope a high probability of trade.  
  
3) M15: Enter a trade with conditions, especially align H4-H1-M15. We can not say that the trade will go as planned.  
But we have done the most important parts of analysis.

Hi, traders! Today USDCAD - BUY - 7.00 GT - 17 pips /I've entered a bit later and I didn't risk for waiting for 20 pips/. USDCHF - BUY - at 9.00 GT - a good setup, but I missed. But I'm waiting for a full retracement on H1 and enter on M15. Otherwise - I'm not sure!!! I'm not going to risk.

I don't like the Quatro cash envelopes at all - your system is better for sure! I earn money with it every day. The weak think for myself is my money management. I have to think over how to encrease the R:R - then the results would be exellent.

Hi, today only EURGBP setup was a perfect one. The other pairs changed their main direction and we have to wait for a new setup. It will be tomorrow - London is closing soon.

Hi,  
  
I want you to test together with my version of Quattro Cash Envelopes known as MyCashingM30. It uses only 2 TFs (H4 and M30).  
  
The charts attached below to try to explain the strategy.  
  
**BUY TRADE**  
  
**H4:**  
5/10 EMA cross up and confirmed by RSI > 50 (white) and Stochastic cross up (white).  
  
  
**M30:**  
1) Trend (H4) is up (white);  
  
2) Price closes below the 5 EMA (H1) of the low;  
  
3) CCI closes below -100 (oversold)  
  
4) Price closes above 7 EMA and confirmed by:  
  
5) RSI (H4) is above 50 and  
  
6) RSI(M30) is above 50 (white).  
  
**BUY = 1)+2)+3)+4)+5)+6)**  
  
**SL@the most recent low**  
**TP@the same amount of SL or up to you**  
  
**The SELL trade is the opposite analysis of the BUY trade**  
  
Feel free to comment for the improvement![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

Hi,  
  
  
There is a signal to go BUY GBPUSD at 18:00 GMT. But I did not take it. Because the London session is about to close.

There is a variaty to use CCI on H1 for a full retracement and enter after confirming RSI on M30 /not M15/. We can use another indicator for confirming retracement has finished, but I haven't an idea what we can use. We'll test and see, but on historical data I have seen the retracement only on M30 is not so safe.

Or we can use CCI on M30 but the settings for 60 min, because it is MTF and it will be more comfortable for directly using on M30.

Hi,  
  
At midnight Eastern time, I will scan, on M15, all the pairs that have 3 conditions appears first as following:  
  
**SELL:**  
1) 5/10 ema(H4) cross down (RED)  
2) Price closes above the 5 ema(H1) of the high  
3) CCI(H1) closes above +100  
  
**BUY:**  
1) 5/10 ema(H4) cross up (GREEN)  
2) Price closes below the 5 ema(H1) of the low  
3) CCI(H1) closes below -100  
  
Once I got the ones that filled the 3 conditions above of the category then I will only concentrate on them.

Hi, traders, I've closed several trades in profit about 20 pips: CHFJPY, USDCHF, EURUSD, CADJPY - 15 pips. The main dificulty is entering in trade, before closing the current 1 hour while H4 RSI is showing us the regular movement. In this moment while the H1 candle isn't closed we are just waiting and we don't know in what direction the movement will go on - is RSI on H1 really aligned with RSI on H4?! I mean - we enter before closing the current candles....

> Hi, traders, I've closed several trades in profit about 20 pips: CHFJPY, USDCHF, EURUSD, CADJPY - 15 pips. The main dificulty is entering in trade, before closing the current 1 hour while H4 RSI is showing us the regular movement. In this moment while the H1 candle isn't closed we are just waiting and we don't know in what direction the movement will go on - is RSI on H1 really aligned with RSI on H4?! I mean - we enter before closing the current candles....

Hi,  
  
I have 2 trades:  
  
  
CHFJPY: +17 pips  
CADJPY: +10 pips  
  
I was using the strategy in POST#263.  
  
I will see the results at the end of this month. If there are no tweaks to do then I will update the system in Doc.  
  
Have a nice weekend!

I used the same latest version of the system like you - in the post 263 - only on M15. I see the results were near the same. First I scan the pairs and then I concentrate only where I see there is a soon setup. Now I'm waiting for GBPUSD. I'll see - it is in my direction.

GBPUSD - BUY - again 20 green pips. The next week we have to test the system and make our statistics - it seems a good one!

Hi, I focused on the system in 263 post - M15 only /not M5/. We test this latest version. You may test it too - all we need to share the results and to see how it works!

Hi,  
  
Today only 1 trade happened on Loonie  
  
I have grabbed 10 pips on SHORT the USDCAD at 10:00 GMT.  
  
Summertime, the Big Boys went already on vacations. The markets are slow. Be careful!

Hi, Sriloba! What is your opinion about the latest version of the system - in 263 post? Do you think is it necessary something to change or is it the best to remain as it is now? What do you think?

Hi,  
  
  
This summer I prefer to use the 3 TFs as following:  
  
H4: The current trend  
  
M30: Entry  
  
M5: Pinpoint  
  
If you want to H4-H1-M15 is fine or you want to try this sequence of TFs, H4-M30-M5, is fine too.  
  
I will explain in details of H4-M30-M5 in the next POST.

Thank you, Sriloba for sharing! First I was so surprised of that you have noticed what I've noticed too - RSI histogram on M30 is better than on H1. But I can't understand - when we have to enter - have we to wait to close the candle on M30 - in 10.00 or we have to enter in 09.10 GT on M5 in advance? Would you clear, please? Thanks!

Hi,  
  
You can enter in M30 or M5.  
  
Pinpoint is not the word I want to use in M5. Forget PINPOINT and instead use Entry in M5.  
  
I have noticed in the past that some trades taken in HTF are better than LTF.  
  
Because in LTF there are micro trends created when there is volatility.

You mean we have to use the retracement on H1, but enter in 3 ways: 1. M30; 2. M15 or M5?

Hi,  
  
Yes, you can enter a trade in the time frame that has confirmed all conditions of entry.  
  
The retracement on H1 and M30 happens almost the same level. Sometimes price pulls back, in H1, almost at the extreme then resume the trend.  
  
I like the retracement occurs on H1. I think the price has pulled back in maximum.  
  
On the other hand, there is less signal alerted on H1 than M30. That why I have prayed you to look more pairs.

Hi,  
  
I grabbed 14 pips in 2 trades.  
  
1) GBPUSD : Sell@10:55 GMT and exit manually +6 pips --- First chart  
  
2) NZDUSD : Buy@10:05 GMT and exit manually +8 pips --- Second chart  
  
Total=1)+2)=14 pips  
  
I decided to exit my trades with a small number of pips because we are in the summertime.

Hi, it is not by the basic rule in the trade GBPUSD - CCI is on 30 min, not H1 retracement - that's why the price began to move on, before falling down.

Hi, Natasha  
  
I owe you a lot for this final improvement system.  
  
You are absolutely right!  
  
M30 for retracement:  
  
The CCI(M30) combines with the 5 EMA(H1) high/low as Support and Resistant give a pretty accurate pullback of price action.  
  
So when price, in M30, closes outside the 5 EMA(H1) high/low and confirmed by CCI(M30) (OB/OS area) then I fly to M5 to look for an entry.  
  
I will correct the DOC in POST#288.

I'm not sure at all the retracement on M30 is just enough for our entry. I didn't check on historical data is retracement on M30 work?

Also, what TP have we to expect on M30 CCI retracement? I think then it is logic to decrease it. The system is going to change!

Hi,  
  
Let stick with M30 CCI retracement for a month of July.  
  
Then we will see the results.

The CCI(M30) combines with the 5 EMA(H1) high/low as Support and Resistant give a pretty accurate pullback of price action.  
I agree with your argument - I've saw on historical data - it's true. But there is something very important think - when we enter after 30 MIN CCI retracement we can catch some micro trends, but not a significant movement of around minimum of 20 pips and even we can lose touching the SL. Because this CCI retracement is not a seriose one - I've noticed that.   
I have a suggestion - to correct the settings of EMA - H_L - 5 period on H1 - it have to be a slower setting in order to receive a precise result on the finising of the H1 retracement. Or we can use a new indicator TARGET BANDS and when we have a touch on M30 I've noticed it is enough as a retracement. You may install and test with it and I'm opened about new ideas. Here is the indi:

Hi guys,  
  
As suggested in POST#296, I have modified the system in POST#288.  
  
  
  
**M30: Retracement**  
  
**Uptrend: Price must touch the lower band and confirmed by CCI is below -100**  
  
**Downtrend: Price must touch the upper band and confirmed by CCI is above 100**  
  
Then fly to M5 to look for entering a trade.  
  
We're going to test for 1 month.

Hi guys,  
  
First trade winner of the month of July, Canada day.  
  
I used the strategy in POST297  
  
I put the Target Bands in M5 just to use the upper bands or lower bands as a target.   
  
The trade exited manually for 13 pips. Because the price is hard to reach the upper bands.

Hi, Sriloba, on the same pair EURJPY I've made 25 green pips. But in 11.05 GT, after CCI retracement with the H1 settings. It is clearer and safer.   
I suggest to make some correctives - H4 - M30 /with 60 min CCI settings/ - M5. In this way we use the Target Band signals on M30 /faster than on H1/, but at the same time 60 min settings on CCI is a full retracement.   
This is the reason you didn't grab min of 20 pips, because the movement continued - the retracement didn't finish.

Hi,  
  
When the market is flat you will see in H4 the MAs cross a lot like a braided hair.

We need time and eforts to confirm every forex trading strategy. It will be better, since80808 to be clearer and give a suggestion in order to improve the system. Everyone knows that trading it's not easy and it is normal to modify the system again and again.....untill reaching some good and stable results!  
It will be unreal to do this at once - this is a long and very hard, difficult process.

Hi,  
  
Here is another way to analyze the market in H4.  
  
This time I use 5 LWMA (high /low) in H4 as the resistant and support and RSI(H4) as a filter  
  
The trend is determined in H4.  
  
CCI, RSI, and Stochastic are used to identify extreme condition and entry.  
  
Today 1 trade on EURUSD.  
  
**H4:** Trend is down  
  
**M15:**  
  
1) Price touches the upper band(5 LWMA_high_H4) and at the same time  
  
2) CCI, RSI, and Stochastic are in the overbought area ( here at least 1 of the 3 indicators is needed to confirm the extreme condition)  
  
3) CCI, RSI, and Stochastic cross down  
  
4) RSI(H4) is below 50 level  
  
**Sell = 1)+2)+3)+4)**  
  
  
**Put the Stop Loss (SL) at the most recent High/Low.**  
  
**Take Profit (TP) when the price touched the opposite of the band or 2 times of SL from the entry ( RR:1:2).**  
  
  
_**Notice:**_ **_I have applied the 5 SMA in the CCI and RSI to make a crossover_**  
  
The trade closed manually with +1 pip. Because US NEWS will release at 15:15 GMT.  
  
I will attach the template shortly.  
  

**THE LONG TRADE IS THE OPPOSITE OF THE ANALYSIS OF THE SHORT TRADE.**

Hi Natasha,  
  
_**The strategy in POST#306 is awesome.**_  
  
I think I offer myself and other fellow traders plenty of green pips in the future.  
  
Here I suggest scanning the pairs like the ones attached below  
  
Enjoy wisely and fully the new recent system.  
  
By the way, I use a 55-inch screen (Samsung) to accommodate my trading style.

Hi,  
  
Enter a trade only in M15.  
  
Ultimately, the system uses only 2-time frames, H4 and M15.

One more question, Sriloba - what is your opinion about thr TP - may be it's better to be put touching the oposite 5 MA? It is looking like a scalping system, I mean it will be logic to put a near TP instead SL to be touched.

Hi,  
  
  
**Put the Stop Loss (SL) at the most recent High/Low.**  
  
**Take Profit (TP) when the price touched the opposite of the band or 2 times of SL from the entry ( RR:1:2).**

Thank you, Sriloba for your quick answer! I'm opened for new ideas and I'm ready to test. I'll share. There are only 2 MTF indicators - 5 MA and RSI. The others are on the current TF and this fact give me a hope for more successfull trades.

Hi,  
  
The GBPJPY is closed by SL and exited with +2 pips  
  
  
H4: The trend is down  
  
M15: All conditions to go SELL are confirmed. When the trade went +10 pips I put SL 3 pips below the entry.  
  
Then suddenly price moved up very fast and took out SL.

Hi, Sriloba! I have noticed in most of the trades is forming double bottom or double top on current CCI on M15. Do you think is it better for our entry confirmation to wait for their forming before trigger?

The problem is that we don't know what the markets will be in advance. We see that - post factum. That's why it is difficult to know what TP will be.

Dear Sriloba, I think there is a possibility to be saved from the hard range and to stay away from entry. If you add the target bands indicator as I in previous posts suggested or any other like this indi then we will see some price volatility of touching the channel. You can think about this problem, because today is a losing trading day - there is a hard range.

Hi,

Hi,  
  
Back from a short vacation ( 1 week).  
  
During my vacation, my friend sent me a link to try TradeONIX. I have loaded TradeOnix system in MT4 and I found the system is a trend following. TradeONIX is very colorful and using Moving Average to do the analysis. So, this week I am going to use the micro lot in my live account to test the system for a week.  
  
I suggest you to go to check TradeONIX in this link: [https://forexwinners.org/forex/trade...orn-full-dvds/](https://forexwinners.org/forex/tradeonix-trading-system-by-russ-horn-full-dvds/)

Hi,  
  
The traders from Quebec, Canada, ask me to suggest some trustful brokers accepting Canadians traders. So they can continue to do a forex trading. I have shown them a few. But they have a problem to withdraw money with VISA, Netteller, and Skrill.  
May I ask you, as forex traders, a favor to advice trustful brokers accepting Canadians traders and easy to withdraw.  
  
I thank you a lot in advance.

Hi, Sriloba! I'm glad you have turned back. I can not download the system you shared. Would you share the rar link to download - I'd like to test the system. Thanks in advance.

Hi,  
  
To learn the TradeOnix system in deep go to this link:[https://forexwinners.org/forex/trade...orn-full-dvds/](https://forexwinners.org/forex/tradeonix-trading-system-by-russ-horn-full-dvds/)  
  
I can not download the files here. It is too big.  
  
If you can download the rar files in the link above you can watch clips video explaining in detail the system.

Thank you, Sriloba very much, you are so kind. I've just installed the indicators and I'll test the system. I suppose you use H1 for the daily direction of the trend, then go to M15 to wait for a retracement and then go to M5 to wait for entry. Am I right?

Hi,  
  
  
The first loss of testing TradeOnix.  
  
Price reached the stop loss.  
  
Four more days to test the TradeOnix.  
  
The system is awesome. Today I'm not lucky.

Hi,  
  
  
You can enter a trade any time frame that you feel comfortable (Risk ratio).  
  
_**LONG/SHORT when all the 6 ArrowsPanel +TBL + Tetragram (Big Bar) are the same color.**_  
  
  
  
I have put one more filter in my analysis. The filter named the TB Cloud (10 EMA/3 SMA ).

Hi, Sriloba! What is your opinion about the system? I'm still in learning the details and I think in order to catch the bottoms and the tops in entry it will be better to use MTF. I mean - first on H4 - to see TBL /the trend on H4/, then go to H1 /TBL - has to be the same color/ and latest to M15 or M5 /to catch or we need to wait for TBL the same color/ and then trigger into the trade. Something in this manner. If you have an idea - please, share. Otherwise I think the system has a potential to be the most profitable, but I for myself I'm not sure that I know how to use it in details. I mean in some cases I enter a bit later. We have to improve it!

Hi, Natasha  
  
Did you able to download the videos of the TradeOnix. Because the author, Rush Horn, explains each indicator very in details.  
  
I like the notion of the next higher time frame. Because this notion gives a strong argument to the entry signal.  
  
I like to trade H1, for a trend, and enter in M15 when all conditions say the same.  
  
Here are the events that I have to see in H1 and M15:  
  
**H1**  
**Uptrend** : TBL and Switch are green. (Switch is the crossover of 2/5 EMAs)  
  
**M15**  
I want to emphasize on TBL HTF and TBM HTF.  
TBL HTF is the longer trend on H1 (TBL is 50 EMA)  
TBM HTF is the medium trend on H1 (TBM is 10 EMA)  
So TBL HTF and TBM HTF are the next higher time frame of the M15.  
  
**Enter a trade in M15 in direction of the TBL HTF, TBM HTF, and Switch HTF is a high probability of catching a lot of green pips.**  
  
**Current TF --- Next HTF**  
M1 ---- M5  
M5 ---- M15  
M15 ---- H1  
M30 ---- H1  
H1 ---- H4  
H4 ---- D1  
D1 ---- W1  
W1 ---- M1  
  
**M15****:****Enter LONG when TBL, Tetragram (long bar) and the 6 arrows are green.**  
  
The timing entry is shown in M15 ( Picture below) is good timing.  
  
Today I missed to SHORT on GBPUSD. Woke up late.

Hello Sai,  
  
Are you having better performance with TradeOnix system than with your Cashing M30? Have you tried it with cryptos?  
  
Thanks!!

Hi,  
  
I like TradeOnix. Because I can use it as the trend following. TradeOnix uses MAs to analyze charts. It is wonderful.  
  
Honestly, I never try cryptos.

Hi,  
  
Yesterday, I did not trade. Because I had to create my own rules. When you create your own rules this means that you understand the system very well.  
  
So today, I have 1 LONG trade on GBPUSD. The trade is closed by price touched the TP (20 pips)  
  
H1:  
  
TBL is still down. But TBM is already up since yesterday So there is an up momentum.  
  
M15:  
  
TBL is up. I went LONG Aggressive ( Tetragram, small bar green).  
  
I have put in M15 daily pivot point the 5 EMAs (H1_H/L) and stochastic, RSI and %R William to give OB/OS area only.  
  
So price touched the 5EMA (low) on H1 and confirmed by %R William (OS). 1 or more oscillators are fine to confirm the price is OS.  
  
So these pieces of information give me more confidence when I enter a trade.  
  
TradeOnix is amazing when you use it as trend following. All the components do a good job. Awesome!!!  
  
I need 1 more week to test the system reorganized by me. Then I will try to put the rules on DOC.

This look great Sai!  
  
So basically you use TradeOnix to identify the trend on the H1. And then you use the other setup on M15 to enter the trade?

Hi,  
  
  
Today I went SHORT on GBPUSD on M5.  
  
After gained +10 pips I put SL@1 pip from entry. Unfortunately, the price reached SL and exited with 1 pip.  
  
The system is awesome. I like the system.  
  
Next week I will continue to test the system in a live account.  
  
Right now, in Canada, all people are sleeping and some are preparing to go to work. But I am going to sleep.

Can you please let us know if the strategy can be applied to smaller time frames stuck as 5 min and below for scalping strategy and how to select the fx pairs according to that.

Hi, Sriloba! I see, here you enter contra trend - on H1 the trend is UP, but you enter SELL. I'm a bit confused because our goal is to confirm the trend following system and in this way we are messing the common rules.   
I have a suggestion - let's confirm the trend following rules, let's confirm the most suitable tempate in order to share the results.  
Please, share which template do you think to use from Monday?  
The system is really good, but we didn't still find the interconnection between the diferent TF in the most suitable way. I think it will be better to think over this elements.  
I mean - on H1 the trend is UP for example, then we enter on M15 by the rules, but in some cases the movement is nearly expired. So it will be better to find aTF when the price is retracing and then enter from the bottom or from the top. Something in this way /the tripple screens of Elder I mean/. Then we'll be safe when the movement is not so big.

Hi,  
  
You went counter trend from H1.  
  
H1: TBL is RED (downtrend)  
  
M15: TBL is GREEN (uptrend). It is ok. But you have to beware the TP. Because the counter trend is a short life.  
  
But I am going to elaborate the system TradeOnix reorganized very soon.

Hi,  
  
  
You can trade on M1 by considering M5 the next higher time frame direction.  
  
  
In my opinion, M5 is enough TF for scalping.

The system is really good, but we didn't still find the interconnection between the diferent TF in the most suitable way. I think...

Hi Nathasha,  
  
You are absolutely right!![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
  
At that time I was greedy when I thought the counter trend was more profitable.  
  
I will share the new template very soon.  
  
Stay tuned!

Hi guys,  
  
This is the TradeOnix reorganized to become the RideYourWave system.  
  
_**Noticed1**_**:** Tetragram used only to authenticate the TradeOnix indicators.  
  
**H4: Identify the current trend**  
  
Uptrend when TB Cloud appears Green dot.  
  
**H1/M30/M15: Enter a trade**  
  
1) Wait for a pullback. The first red dot appears.  
2) Buy = Green dot appears confirmed by AO is below the zero level then changes to Blue bar + MACD histogram is above the zero level (Blue bar)  
  
a) Stop Loss is placed at the most recent low  
b) Take Profit is placed the amount of Stop Loss. 1:1 RR  
  
_**IF you enter a trade on M30 or M15 don't forge to verify the trend on H1. H1 is the next higher time frame. The trend (TB Cloud) must go the same direction from H4_H1_M30/M15**_  
  
_**Noticed2**_**:** **Always enter on the first green dot (uptrend) with all the confirmations at the same time. It is very important. Because you enter with a good price.**  
  
Let's test it together for a week.  
  

**Don't forget to read the Password TradeOnix.txt**

Excuse me, Sriloba, why are you using Tetragram on H4? To identify the trend you have wrote you are using TB Cloud. Would you clear, please!  
Another question - entering on M15, have we to wait the TB Cloud on M30 and H1 to turn its color the same like the TB Cloud of H4? Because we know that M15 is quicker than M30 and H1 and entering on M15 it is logic the color of TB Cloud of M30 and H1 is still of the retracement color.   
Have we to wait for a retracement on H1 first, then for a retracement on M30 and finally on M15?

Hi,  
  
**Tetragram is there only to AUTHENTICATE or to Validate the TradeOnix indicators**. It _is not used_ to analyze forex at any circumstances.  
  
For the first time, traders install the TradeOnix indicators in the MT4 then they have to put the Password in Tetragram to AUTHENTICATE the TradeOnix indicators otherwise it will display ERROR TO AUTHENTICATE.  
  
I have modified the TB Cloud parameters. We use the TB Cloud to identify the trend in H4.  
  
You can enter a trade on H1 to M15.  
  
If you enter a trade on M30 or M15 then you have to align TB Cloud in H1. Because we want to make sure that the direction in all TFs are the same for high probability of trade.  
  
ALSO YOU CAN ENTER A TRADE ON M5 AND MAKE SURE THE TREND IN H4 _H1_M5 ARE THE SAME DIRECTION.  
  
If you enter a trade on the sequence below then you have to align the direction as follows:  
  
1) H4_H1  
2) H4_H1_M30  
3) H4_H1_M15  
4) 3) H4_H1_M5 (Be carefull)  
  
Hope this can clear the situation.

Thank you, Sriloba for your quick response! I understand that Tetragram is not used for our analize! I'll test and share! Thanks once again, you are so kind to clear in details!

Hi,  
  
The strategy in POST362 did not go well. Because AO is too large.  
  
So I have changed the whole analysis as follows:  
  
**H1: Identify the trend**  
  
**Downtrend:**  
  
1) TBL is RED and confirmed by 2) Tetragram long RED bar  
  
  
**M15 or M5: Enter a trade**  
  
1) Price closes above the upper band and at the same time  
2) RSI closes above 70 level  
3) TBL is RED and confirmed by  
4) Tetragram long RED bar  
  
Make sure that the Switch appears RED (2/5 EMA cross down)  
  
**SELL = 1)+2)+3)+4)**  
  
Let's test it together for a week.  
  

**Don't forget to read the Password TradeOnix.txt**

  
  
Enjoy, my friends!

Hi, Sriloba! Thanks for your new idea! Lets try and share the next week! I think the previous system was not so good - H4 - H1 were not in synchron.   
Lets see this week!

Hi,  
  
Next week you will test 2 strategies. 1 in POST368 and the other one I am going to show you.  
  
I have tested the 2 strategies last week. But I like this one, RideYourWave1 as the template.  
  
So let see...  
  
**Downtrend**  
  
**H1: Identify the trend**  
  
TBL is RED and confirmed by Tetagram is LONG RED BAR. ( Tetragram is composed of 4 indicators (TBL, Switch, TBM, TBS)).  
  
**TBL:** Trend Bias Long (50EMA)  
**TBM:** Trend Bias Medium (10 EMA)  
**TBS:** Trend Bias Short (3 SMA)  
**Switch:** is a micro trend bias (2/5 EMA)  
  
**M15: Enter a trade**  
  
_**First wait for the price makes a pullback as follows:**_**_VERY IMPORTANT_**  
  
1) The switch appears blue (2/5 EMAs cross up)  
  
2) Tetragram appears gray bar  
  
3) Macd histogram appears blue bar (above the zero level)  
  
then  
  
5) TBL is RED  
  
6) TBL LONG RED BAR confirmed by  
  
7) RSI is below 50 (RED)  
  
8) Stochastic cross down (RED)  
  
9) Macd histogram is above the zero  
  
**SELL** = 5)+6)+7)+8)+9)  
  
SL at the recent high  
TP at the same amount of SL from the entry  
  
I like this strategy because I have used to enter a trade in M15 using RSI, Stochastic and Macd to filter a signal in another strategy.  
  
I hope this is the last improvement of the strategy. So we can concentrate to grab some GREEN PIPS  
  
  
Enjoy!

Hi,  
  
I just want to share with you how I scan the markets that are ready to trade very soon.  
  
I post 3 different markets of M15 in 1 screen.  
  
You can verify the trend on H1 by looking on the arrows panel the icon TBL HTF. Because the next HTF of M15 is H1.  
  
Before entering a trade don't forget to verify the trend on HTF. Because we are using the trend following strategy.

If I am trading M5 TF, my next TBL HTF will be M15, correct?

> Hi, I just want to share with you how I scan the markets that are ready to trade very soon. I post 3 different markets of M15 in 1 screen. You can verify the trend on H1 by looking on the arrows panel the icon TBL HTF. Because the next HTF of M15 is H1. Before entering a trade don't forget to verify the trend on HTF. Because we are using the trend following strategy. Sai Ram {image}

Hi,  
  
I hope very soon. I have no doubt when you use trend following to trade forex.  
  
But when the market is ranging there will be a lot of bad trades.

Hi,  
  
  
Yes, you are correct. But may I suggest you check the price behavior on H1 before entering a trade.

Hi,  
  
  
I have tried to reduce indicators in the past. But when come to do the analysis I feel that I miss some pieces of information.  
  
MACD, RSI and Stochastic are the momentum indicators. But I use them differently.  
  
MACD histogram uses to catch the early signal  
Stochastic uses as the momentum of price action  
RSI uses to confirm the signal when it is above or below the 50 line  
  
The arrow panel gives a quick view  
The 50 EMAs (HLC) is a wave of the trend. When the price is above the wave then the trend is up and the opposite is true.  
TBL is 50 EMA (Trend) but in another form of indicator  
Tetragram is a very good filter because it is composed of 4 indicators.  
  
That why it is hard to reduce indicators because they have a specific job to do.

Hi,  
  
Today 1 trade on NZDUSD. After 7 hours I closed my trade with +6 pips.   
  
Wow! This pair is very slow.  
  
H1: The trend is down  
  
M15: Sell NZDUSD according to the rule.

i tried for this one for long time tirelessly and it is limited usage like 9 instances of mt4,actually my friend bought it and i tried to use his copy and it didnt work,so i bought it,30 dollars is not that much.its good to buy an dget over with it.its not helpful always,same as all indicators requires more confirmation to be traded.

Hi fellow traders,  
  
For the week coming I have simplified the template by reducing some indicators.  
  
**Downtrend**  
  
H1: TBL is RED === Downtrend  
  
M15:  
I. Wait for the pullback as follows:  
1) Blue arrow appears  
2) Tetragram appears GRAY bar  
3) Macd histogram is above the zero line (BLUE)  
  
THEN  
  
II. SELL when  
4) RED arrow appears  
5) TBL is RED  
6) Tetragram appears RED bar (the short bar is aggressive entry and the long bar is conservative entry)  
7) Macd histogram is above the zero line  
  
**SELL = 4)+5)+6)+7)**  
  
**Stop Loss** (SL) is placed at the most recent high  
**Take Profit** is placed at the same amount of SL from entry  
  
**LONG TRADE is the opposite analysis of the SHORT TRADE**

Hi, Sriloba! Thanks for sharing the simplified temlate! Bur I have a question: Have we to wait for all retracement points on M15 - I - 1), 2), 3) to happen in one and the same time - I mean on a vertical line or is it possible the indicators to change their color sequentially?   
I ask the same for II - 4), 5), 6) and 7) - have we wait to happen on one and the same vertical line or never mind?   
I suppose you understand what I mean - I think this is very important for our regular entry. I'm not sure what to do.   
Thank you, Sriloba, once again!

Hi,  
  
**Downtrend** :  
  
**Retracement in M15** :  
  
When Tetragram appears GRAY bar means the BLUE arrow appears according to the author. But from my experiences, I want to see, also, the macd histogram goes above the zero line, BLUE bar, for a better entry signal.  
  
Also, I use trendline breaks by using the indicator attached below.

You mean all the points have to be fullfilled in one and the same time - we have to see all the indicators in their regular colors in one line. And when Cynthia's Triangle Breakout confirms the entry - then trigger. Is it true?

Is it regular when the blue arrow appears and the MACD goes above zero line - /BLUE bars/ appears not in the same moment when the blue arrow and the GREY BAR appears, but after one, two or three candles later, lets say for example? This is very important to know for me!  
Thanks a lot!

Hi,  
  
Downtrend:  
  
After price pulls back and wait for sell signal.  
  
  
Sell when :  
  
1) RED arrow appears + TBL is RED + Tetragram bar is RED (short bar for aggressive entry or long bar for conservative entry) + macd hist is above the zero  
  
OR   
  
TRENDLINE breaks down and confirmed by 1)

Hi,  
  
As long as macd hist. is above the zero for SHORT TRADE. Because we want to enter a trade when the bearish momentum starts to move.

The examples you have paste show us the perfect movement when all the indicators are aligned in one and the same time. That's why it is dificult to understand all the variaties for trigger the entry. This is after retracement - everythink has to be fullfilled in one and the same time. But what about for the retracement - I'd like to understand in details, please!

Hi,  
  
When you initiate a SELL/BUY trade you must have the arrow RED/BLUE appears first then others confirmations come after.

Hi,  
  
I use the dot for the trailing stop. It helps a lot for SL and TP.  
  
Try it and you will see your own eyes.

Hi,  
  
I want to make myself clear about the good entry when on MACD Histogram behavior.  
  
  
The chart below tries to explain the idea.  
  
M15:  
SELL trade  
  
Here we have red arrow,TBL is red, Tetragram is red.  
  
_**BUT MACD HISTOGRAM WAS BELOW THE ZERO LINE 3 CANDLES BEFORE. THIS CANCELS THE SELL ENTRY. BECAUSE THE BEARISH MOMENTUM WAS HAPPENED FOR A WHILE.**_  
  
  
**LONG TRADE is the opposite analysis of the SHORT TRADE**

Hi,  
  
  
This setup is acceptable in extremis.  
  
  
**Downtrend**

Hi,  
  
Really, I don't know. I found it on the other website.  
  
It looks like a Parabolic SAR indicator in somehow. But I use it primarily in trailing stop. For me, it is very useful for trailing a stop loss and a very good tool  
  
for taking profit.

Hi fellows trader,  
  
  
Please change the setting on Tradeonix-Switch as follows:  
  
  
On the arrow in the picture below change the **5** into **10** to form******2/10****** EMAs crossover.  
  
I have done a lot of paper trades using the 2/10 EMAs and 2/5 EMAs crossover and compare the efficiency of the 2 crossovers.  
  
I found the 2/10 EMAs crossover gives a better entry signal than 2/5 EMAs crossover.  
  
Try it. You will be happy to see the accuracy of the 2/10 EMAs crossover.

Hi,  
  
The first loss of the month.  
  
Let's see ...  
  
**GBPUSD**  
  
H1: The trend is up at that time  
  
  
M15:   
I) Wait for the pullback is done  
  
II) Buy according to the rules is respected.  
  
  
Unfortunately, price is retraced to the Stop Loss. My trade exited with -11 pips.  
  
It is ok if there is a loss even following the rules. The market decides where it goes.  
  
Now the trend changed from up to down and well confirmed in H1. So I am going only to sell the GBPUSD in M15 with the confirmations  
  
Stay tuned  
  
  
Sai Ram

Hi,  
  
I took a Buy trade. Because H1 was uptrend. Macd histogram was, for the first time, above the zero.   
  
The BUY trade is ok.

It is an agressive BUY trade - we see a short green bar on the tetragram. It will be better to trade a confirmed entry - a long green bar on the tetragram.

Hi,  
  
You are absolutely right!  
  
Enter on a LONG BAR TETRAGRAM. It is safer.

Hi,  
  
Yes. You are right. It is better to start trading when Frankfurt opens.

Hi,  
  
Enter on LTFs as M30, M15 or M5 it is up to you. You can choose your preferred time frame to enter a trade as long as your risk management is precalculated.  
  
  
Today I entered a trade on M30 on EURUSD.  
  
  
  
H1: Uptrend ---- TBL is GREEN  
  
  
M30: enter LONG trade according to the rules.  
  
The trade exited at the same amount of SL, +11 pips

This trade is not according to the rules - on pullback I can't see a grey bar and the entering a trade MACD green histogram is not below 0 line.

To enter on M15 or M30 are different templates - in some cases I noticed M15 its better, because we enter earlier. We can use M30 to find the retracement and then enter on M15 early, not to wait entering on M30. Something in this matter I mean!

Hi,  
  
  
You have sharp eyes. Because price pulled back way to change TBL (RED) and Tetragram appeared long RED bar.  
  
That's why GRAY Tetragram did not appear. But you can go to H1 you will see the GRAY bar of Tetragram right before enter a trade on M30  
  
For the first time MACD histogram is above the zero level is acceptable in extremis. I have shown it in the past thread if you go back.

Hi,  
  
Today I closed EURUSD with +1 pip  
  
H1: TBL was RED == Downtrend  
  
M30: Sell EURUSD according to the rules.  
  
SL@12 pips from the entry  
TP@12 pips as SL  
  
I was realized that EURUSD was struggled to go down further. In that case, the buyers enter into the market and probably push the EURUSD  
up. So I decided to close my trade and jump to bed.  
  
Goodnight, guys!

Hi, with the previous M15 template there wasn't an entry SELL setup - the MACD histogram is red. In my opinion - Ride your Wave 2 is better. We may work over the system in order improving it, but it's better than M30 for sure.

Hi,  
  
**I have an idea of how to improve the template, RideYourWave2, as follows:**  
  
**H1:** TBL is GREEN === Uptrend  
1) Wait for the pullback when Tetragram bar painted _**GRAY**_ after the candle closed (See chart H1)  
  
Then go to M15  
  
**M15:** Buy when all conditions confirmed as follows:  
  
1) TBL is GREEN  
2) Tetragram LONG BAR is GREEN  
3) 2/5 EMAs on H1 is GREEN (Here, we use MTF indicator. The signal can be flip flop)  
4) Macd Histogram is below the zero line then paints GREEN  
  
**BUY = 1)+2)+3)+4)**  
  
**SL** below the lower band  
**TP** when Tetragram painted GRAY  
  
_**Remind:**_ Tetragram consists of 4 indicators: TBL, TBM, TBS, Switch  
  
_**Tetragram short Green/Red bar is an aggressive mode**_**(Here we don't have the 4 indicators in the same color)**  
**_Tetragram long_** _**Green/Red**_** _bar is a conservative mode_(Here we have the 4 indicators in the same color)**  
  
**TBL HTF, TBM HTF === H1 is HTF of M15**  
  
  
**The downtrend analysis is the opposite of the analysis of the uptrend**  
  
  
Please post your results in this thread. So we can discuss together.

Hi,  
  
I've tested RideYourWave2 for a week. I found it was hard to find the setup. But last week, I came up with another version of RideUrWave3.  
  
Let's see the rule.  
  
H4: Determine the big trend  
  
LTFs(M30,M15,M5): Enter a trade and confirm the direction of the immediate HTF.  
  
HTF----LTF  
H1-----M30, M15  
M15---M5  
  
The chart attached below tries to illustrate the ideas mentioned above.  
  
**H4: Big trend**  
**TBL is RED ---- downtrend**  
  
**M5: Enter a trade**  
  
1) TBL is RED (Current trend in the current TF)  
2) Tetragram is RED (small or tall bar. it doesn't matter)  
3) CCI must be going above the ZERO then cross below the ZERO  
4) TBL HTF must be RED. It located at the downright of your screen **(This criterion is very important for filtering a signal)**  
  
**SELL=1)+2)3)+4)**  
  
SL@the most recent high  
TP@the same amount of SL from the entry.  
  
  
**The uptrend analysis is the opposite of the downtrend analysis**  
  
Enjoy!  
  
  
Sai Ram

Hi guys,  
  
  
Download the indicator attached below and put in the indicators folder. It is not a perfect indicator but it will help us to spot overbought and oversold area.  
  
The charts below show a sell and buy entries.

Hi,  
  
I went SHORT on GBPUSD. My trade is exited by SL.  
  
Let's see my analysis.  
  
H4:  
  
TBL is RED --- Downtrend  
  
  
M15:  
  
1) TBL was RED  
2) Tetragram displayed tall bar  
3) Vostro was above 80  
4) CCI went above ZERO then cross below ZERO  
5) TBL HTF is RED  
  
SELL=1)+2)+3)+4)+5)  
  
SL@ the most recent high( 17 pips)  
TP@ the same amount of SL  
  
After gaining 10 pips I put SL@BE+spread. Unfortunately, GU exited with spread  
  
Let's wait for the next setup![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f64f.png?v=15.1)

Hi, Sriloba! Thanks very much for sharing this latest version of the system! But what do you think to use it for scalping - lets say HTF - 15 or I think it is better 5 min TF, and LTF - 1 min? Then we use a trend following system too - we enter in the direction of the main trend and in the same time we are using the opened oportunity to surf at once without wasting time. The other very important positive thing is we can enter several times - I think we can enter about 10 times per day on 1 min TF and grib 7 - 10 pips per every entry. In the very beginning of my trading learning I have thought the scalping is not a good idea. But during my hard work I concluded that scalping it is better - we are reacting as quick as possible before the market has changed. We are sitting in front of the computer not in vain - if we have losed the only exact moment for entry - there is another entry too in scalping. And at the end of our working day we have collected more and more green pips.  
I suggest you to think over this idea, I see a big potential in it. I really apreciate your hard work and we have to confirm and use the system as good as possible.

Hi, Sriloba! What about the system? Are you still testing it or are you thinking over a new idea? Now, I'm surching an information about a trend following system, but sculping on M1. There are many systems, but I didn't find what I'm looking for. I'm thinking over an usage of renko or range bars to elliminate the market noise. If you have any suggestion - please share! It will be helpfull!!! Thanks!

Hi, Sriloba! You didn't appear yet to discuss the results! What about the latest version of your system? We really miss your professional opinion in order to confirm the results. What do you think? Nobody is sharing the test of the strategy, so I'm waiting for your answer!

Can you share your HTF/LTF combination, your main trading instruments and overall win ratio?  
And what template are you using at the moment?

Hi, I follow 445 post of Sriloba with all details - first H4 , then M15 , etc...... I'm using 28 forex pairs - I mean majors and many crosses. The ratio is 1:1, because having in mind all my experience it is very difficult to achieve 1:1,5 or 1:2. So I use 1:1. While waiting for a higher ratio the trend is changing and so many times i'm a loser in that way.  
The template I use is shared by Sriloba in the same post.

Hi, traders! Today - 10 successfull and 2 negative trades - it is 83% successfull system. I've promissed to share - so it is very promissing. Every trade about 15 - 20 green pips - it depends of the pair and where is the SL. TP = SL.  
If anybody wants to share - please write down.

Hi, as I've promissed - today 10 successfull and 3 negative trades - it is about 77% success! It is really a promissing system, but today there was a great volatility on the markets. I'm afraid about the results when the markets is ranging, because the system is a trend following one. Is there anybody to share a result, please, write and discuss!
