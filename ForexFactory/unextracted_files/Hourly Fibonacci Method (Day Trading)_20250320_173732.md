Hi all,  
  
I believe this day-trade method is very simple and effective. I decide my bias for the day basically using patterns analysis on the Daily chart (also, the Weekly and Monthly charts – if applicable) and price-break of most recent swing high or low on the 4 Hour chart.  
I seek trade set-ups on the hourly chart using overlapping Fibonacci levels supported by previous highs/lows and pivot points. My Stop Loss placement is easily determined based on the hourly most recent swing high/low, and I enter trades using Limit Orders.  
The 15min and 5min charts are only used to have a clearer view of the Hourly chart price action.  
  
I use this method personally on my live account, and it is inspired by a respected and successful veteran trader. It is virtually a fully mechanical method – except for the simple analyses on the Daily chart and above.  
  
It’s not a get-rich-quick method, neither is it the HOLY GRAIL; and it involves a high level of patience as it doesn’t produce tradable set-ups every day. However, I study the four majors and I usually get an average of about five trading opportunities in a week – depending on the market environment.  
  
As much as I can, I’ll post at least a trade bias, and, if available, trade set-ups on any of the four majors everyday as I carry on my personal trades; I believe we’ll all find this method very rewarding as we familiarize ourselves with it.  
  
Tunji.

**Today on EURUSD – Daily and H4 charts support Long trades, but…**  
  
**On the Daily chart**(attached), we could see the market is in a symmetrical triangle formation. From a longer term perspective, this is a price consolidation phase and it’s probably better to stay out of the market for now. However, from a day-trade perspective, price recently broke the most recent swing high @ 1.4072 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) upward. This signals the possibility of further upward move. Again, although price is advancing toward the upper part of the symmetrical triangle – a critical resistance area – there’s still room for price to move a bit further upward. Please note we’re only contemplating a Long trade because we’re analyzing the market from a day-trade perspective.   
Nevertheless, the upper part of the symmetrical triangle remains a critical resistance area. As a conservative trader, it’s just ok to wait for a clearer coast, or reduce your risk if you decide to seek a Long trade set-up on the hourly chart.   
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price recently broke the most recent swing high @ 1.4014 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) upward. From a day-trade perspective, this automatically shifts our bias for price movement upward. The green horizontal line @ 1.3910 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it – in the absence of any new and higher swing low – our bullish or upward bias remains intact.  
  
However, we still need our hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels – to seek promising areas to take our long positions. Price pattern on the hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows. Please note that our aim is to buy a dip in today’s up-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

**On the Daily chart**(attached), price recently broke the most recent swing high @ 1.6379 (which we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line) upward. This signals the possibility of further price movement upward. A major resistance level – the GBPUSD pair year high – is @ 1.6744 (which we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line). This, however, is hundreds of pips away, so, it’s not in any way an imminent barrier for a Long trade from a day-trade perspective – barring any sudden price surge.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), from a day-trade perspective, we are in a nice up-trend: price is forming higher highs and higher lows. Price has broken the most recent swing high @ 1.6343 (which we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line) upward, and re-testing it. This is another good sign supporting a Long trade.  
  
However, we still need our hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels – to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows. Please note that our aim is to buy a dip in today’s up-trend.

Hi,  
  
Just wanted to let you know there has already been a similar thread using fibs on the hourly, it proved popular and is worth a read. HOpe fully your thread will be as popular, good luck. <http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=75922>

Hi Nick,   
thanks for this information, I just checked the thread out. You’re quite right: Dazfx also uses the fib tool on the hourly chart, but, as you’ve probably noticed (or would notice), our approaches are slightly different. The method I use neither requires SMA nor Stochastic Oscillator; all its primary parameters are price based. Also, this method requires overlapping fibs – among a few other parameters – to consider a trade as viable. I find Dazfx approach also insightful and I believe it’ll give FF members the choice of employing the fib tool on the hourly in ways that suit their individual personalities.  
And, thanks for your well wishes.   
  
@ neziah  
Hope you’re finding this method helpful? I’ve only been able to post the Trade Biases for now – you should be seeing the Hourly Trade Set-ups soon; and that’ll definitely give you a better understanding of the method.

****  
  
Earlier today, we concluded today’s bias is to go Long.  
  
**The Hourly chart**(attached) is currently forming a tradable pattern. Price seems to have topped temporarily @ 1.6481. Hence, we expect price to retrace to the area between 1.6418 and 1.6355 (which is the area between the 50% and 100% fib. retracement levels – drawn from the most recent hourly swing low to the current price-top). Let’s seek to buy around this area. If price exceeds the 1.6355 level downward, our bullish bias is no more valid and we enter a no-trading zone. Our primary profit target is @ 1.6514 (the 127% fib. ext.).  
  
Also, if price breaks above 1.6481 (current price-top) before retracing to the buy-area, we’ll have to redraw our Fibonacci tools using a new top & the most recent hourly swing low to determine new potential areas to buy.  
  
**The 15min. chart**(attached) gives us a clearer view of the hourly price action and the potential areas to buy (please note it’s advisable to set a Limit order ahead of time as price could move down to these level and reverse sharply in our favor)  
This chart is rather cluttered but if we look closely, there are a couple of potential reversal levels available. You choose your preferred level based on your personality.  
  
fib 61.8% ret. @ 1.6403;   
fib 78.6% ret. @ 1.6382.   
  
Initial Stop Loss @ 1.6353; primary Profit target @ 1.6514 (Please remember to factor in your broker’s pip-spread).  
  
Please note that all these Fibonacci (fib.) levels have other pivots, overlapping fibs or previous highs/lows supporting them (they are the cause of this cluttered chart). As such, price could reverse at any of the points. The issue here is that the deeper the fib level you choose to buy from, the smaller the pips you’ll risk and the more your pip-profit; BUT, also the more the likelihood of you missing the trade as price might not retrace that deep before moving back upward.  
You need your own discretion here.  
  
Please keep your risk low. Don’t risk more than 2% of your capital. Personally, I risk about 0.5% per trade; and each trade has a potential profit target of 1% or more – based on my exit levels.  
We MUST NEVER assume we KNOW where price is going next!  
  
P.S.:   
Similar Short trade and Long trade set-ups are forming on the USDCHF and GBPUSD pairs respectively.  
Also, always keep in mind any major news releases. Be wary of possible price volatility during these periods.

If you’ve not been able to go Long on the GBPUSD based on the Long trade set-up that was posted a few hours ago (using the fib 61.8% retracement @ 1.6403), a new hourly swing low has been formed @ 1.6395; hence, the previous set-up is no more valid. If you took the trade around the fib 61.8% ret., it’s time to move your stop to just under the new hourly swing low @ 1.6395 (Hope you see this post in time, in case price decides to break the swing low downward).  
Another signal that is currently weakening our upward move bias is the waving –ve MACD divergence that is about crossing below its signal line. MACD crossing below its signal line will validate the –ve MACD divergence, which supports the possibility of further price movement downward.  
NOTE: See the attached hourly chart  
  
Personally, I took this trade @ the fib 61.8% ret.; took some profits when price moved favorably by almost the same amount of pips I risked initially (47pips), and have now moved my Stop Loss for the remaining position to under the new hourly swing low @ 1.6395.

**On the Daily chart**(attached), price struggled to continue its upward move yesterday, and it closed with a doji candle formation. The doji gave a signal of possible price reversal downward – especially since it formed around the 1.6440 area, which, although offered no distinct high or low, is congested with previous support and resistance levels. To buttress our bearish bias, price recently broke below previous day low @ 1.6355.   
The critical support trend-line is still hundreds of pips below the current price level, hence – barring any intense price volatility – we can still conveniently seek a Short trade set-up on the hourly chart, as long as the H4 charts supports a Short trade.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing low @ 1.6355 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) downward. As we’ve probably observed, this swing low @ 1.6355, coincidentally, is also the previous day low. From a day-trade perspective, this is a good sign supporting a Short trade. The white horizontal line @ 1.6481 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.  
  
However, we still need our hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

Earlier today, we concluded today’s bias is to go Short.  
  
**The Hourly chart**(attached) is currently forming a tradable pattern. Price seems to have bottomed temporarily @ 1.6283. Hence, we expect price to retrace to the area between 1.6350 and 1.6416 (which is the area between the 50% and 100% fib. retracement levels – drawn from the most recent hourly swing high to the current price-bottom). Let’s seek to sell around this area. If price exceeds the 1.6416 level upward, our bearish bias is no more valid and we enter a no-trading zone.

Also, if price breaks below 1.6283 (current price-bottom) before retracing to the sell-area, we’ll have to redraw our Fibonacci tools using a new bottom & the most recent hourly swing high to determine new potential areas to sell.

Tunji, very instructive thread. Keep it up. Like to know the times you trade and whether you take into consideration current market conditions. Cos as I see it we are in earnings season with the market directioneless cos the mutual funds are on the sidelines thus we have a lot of false breakouts and quick reversals. Not really a market to implement any trending strategy. Its all about buy at support sell at resistance. If you have noticed the markets only moves nicely at the beginning of the sessions. London 0600 gmt, New york 1200 gmt and Asian 2400 gmt. Aside these times the makets go nowhere.

Thanks Okehiedon. Usually, I trade the full London/early New York sessions (06:00GMT – 16:00GMT). Regarding current market conditions: Yes! I take all market conditions – both fundamental and technical – into consideration, but since my trading approach tends heavily toward technical analysis, I focus primarily on the “stories” the charts are telling. All the same, your observation of a “directionless” market has been visible, particularly, on three of the four major pairs (EURUSD, GBPUSD & USDCHF) since the beginning of June; and, as you’ve also rightly observed, it has made successful implementation of trending strategies quite a difficult – though not impossible – task. However, I believe that, with proper trade management of a trending day-trading method, you could still make modest profits while we wait for a more auspicious market environment.On the other hand, if you’re a successful veteran-trader with years of experience under your belt, you might possibly have a number of strategies in your trading toolbox – including one that is more suitable for a consolidating market.

I employ many of these methods in my trading. In fact, they make up about half of my toolset.  
  
So you use Fib retracements to enter but you don't use targets to exit??  
  
It would amaze you how many times price will break out of what I like to call the 'zone' (between 38 and 61) and reach the target to the pip and then begin the pullback process again, at which time you redraw the fib from the breakout to the target......after a while you can't help but see the market as just an infinite cycle of fibs running their course, from the tick chart to the monthly...  
  
If you would like to know more and maybe expand your toolset I highly suggest checking out these two threads. This is basically the proverbial 'holy grail' for those that actually want to learn how to TRADE, rather than learning to follow lagging indicators that only inhibit your ability to actually the learn the market and utilize the most important indication of market direction: Price.

Hi Justin, thanks for your comment. I have exit levels – as you would see in my trade set-ups analyses above.  
You’re absolutely right about your allusion to the infinite numbers of ways market expresses itself: regardless of the tool and system we employ, every market moment or trade is unique in itself. The best traders respect that, and they know their successes are based on their consistency and unwavering faith in their proven edges, which, among other things, must put into consideration reward/risk ratio – not just win/loss ratio.  
  
To thrive in this market, we definitely must not stop learning. Thanks for your references; I’ll definitely check them out.  
  
  
You too, have a nice weekend.

Hi Tunji,  
  
I was looking at your charts and notice that you don't have the price on the fib lines. If you or anyone else in interested in displaying the price on the lines, do the following:  
  
Edit your fib by placing it on your chart and double clicking it  
Now right click the fib and select "fibo properties"  
Click on "fibo levels"  
In the description box at the end of any text, put in "%$" without the speech marks  
Click "ok"  
  
If you already knew this information, then please disregard this post.  
  
Good luck with your thread and your trading strategy!

Thanks Okehiedon. Actually, I started studying and trading forex almost two years ago (August will mark my second year); though I attempted trading the Nigerian stock market for more than a year prior to when I got into currencies.

Okay lets see the probabilities next week using fibs. For GU (4hr chart) price found resistance at the 61.8 fib level of the 30 jun 09 high (1.6743) and the 8 jul 09 low (1.5982) @ 1.6452. However price action is unclear after price bounced of the 50 fib level of the 1.6743 high at 1.6379 the 9 jul 09 high and did not form a lower low before reversing to test the 61.8 fib level as earlier hihglighted. My opinion is that better to stay out until an hourly close above 1.6452 for bulls or an hourly close below fridays low 1.6264 for bears. Between that area is to buy at support (1.6273 area) sell at resistance (1.6452 area). What do you guys think?

Good analysis but the thread starter stated it clear that its an hourly-intraday strategy.  
  
as simple as this look, daily is in pennant, bouncing off support and resistance of the daily time frame, it has bounced of the resistance with a bearish reversal candle formation, hence look for bear till the daily support.  
  
the same is applicable to EURO AND SWISSY, price trading with a specified range, trade withing the trading range until we break out.  
  
keep it simple

**On the Daily chart**(attached), price closed below the symmetrical triangle on Thurday – last week, re-tested it on Friday; and currently, it seems set to continue its downward move. To buttress this bearish bias, price recently broke last week Thurday low @ 1.0701 (a previous critical support level). From a day-trade perspective, we have good reason to go Short – provided the H4 chart support the downward move bias.   
The next critical support level is @ 1.0630 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line). We should keep this level in mind (in relation to our profit target, in case we are eventually able to get a Short trade set-up on the hourly chart). If price breaks below the level before retracing upward, it’ll even make the coast clearer for a Short trade.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing low @ 1.0701 (which we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line) downward. As we’ve probably observed, this swing low @ 1.0701, coincidentally, is also the last week Thursday low that we discussed on the Daily chart. From a day-trade perspective, this is a good sign supporting a Short trade. The white horizontal line @ 1.0816 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.  
The critical support level @ 1.0630 (which we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line) that we also discussed on the Daily chart is visible too on H4 chart. Let’s really keep it in mind when managing our Short trades – in case we eventually got into one.  
  
However, we still need our hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

Earlier today, we concluded today’s bias is to go Short.  
  
**The Hourly chart**(attached) is currently forming a tradable pattern. Price seems to have bottomed temporarily @ 1.0658. Hence, we expect price to retrace to the area between 1.0706 and 1.0753 (which is the area between the 50% and 100% fib. retracement levels – drawn from the most recent hourly swing high to the current price-bottom). Let’s seek to sell around this area. If price exceeds the 1.0753 level upward, our bearish bias is no more valid and we enter a no-trading zone. Our primary profit target is @ 1.0633 (the 127% fib. ext.).  
  
Also, if price breaks below 1.0658 (current price-bottom) before retracing to the sell-area, we’ll have to redraw our Fibonacci tools using a new bottom & the most recent hourly swing high to determine new potential areas to sell.  
NOTE: Price will reach our profit target before the critical support @ 1.0630 that we discussed much earlier today – an encouraging sign. However, that would be if price didn’t break below the current price-bottom before retracing upward the sell-area.  
  
**The 15min. chart**(attached) gives us a clearer view of the hourly price action and the potential areas to sell (please note it’s advisable to set a Limit order ahead of time as price could move up to these level and reverse sharply in our favor)  
This chart is rather cluttered but if we look closely, there are a couple of potential reversal levels available. You choose your preferred level based on your personality.  
  
fib 61.8% ret. @ 1.0717;   
fib 78.6% ret. @ 1.0733.   
  
Initial Stop Loss @ 1.0755; primary Profit target @ 1.0633 (Please remember to factor in your broker’s pip-spread).  
  
Please note that all these Fibonacci (fib.) levels have other pivots, overlapping fibs or previous highs/lows supporting them (they are the cause of this cluttered chart). As such, price could reverse at any of the points. The issue here is that the higher the fib level you choose to sell from, the smaller the pips you’ll risk and the more your pip-profit; BUT, also the more the likelihood of you missing the trade as price might not retrace that high before moving back downward.  
You need your own discretion here.  
  
Please keep your risk low. Don’t risk more than 2% of your capital. Personally, I risk about 0.5% per trade; and each trade has a potential profit target of 1% or more – based on my exit levels.  
We MUST NEVER assume we KNOW where price is going next!  
  
P.S.:   
Similar Long trade set-up is forming on the EURUSD pairs.  
Also, always keep in mind any major news releases. Be wary of possible price volatility during these periods.

Pretty good job Tex, but you didn’t use the most recent hourly swing high to draw your fibs. The most recent hourly swing high is lower than the swing high you used. Price is currently not forming a higher high – we’re kind of in a consolidation phase on the USDJPY hourly right now. Be careful.

Hi Tunji, looks like the USD/CHF is going to play out nicely..  
I have recently gone thru a total makeover of my trading. I have decided to stop using any indicators (crutches) and simply focus on price action.  
I plan on using Fibs as a guide to where price will tend to go and enter/exit accordingly.  
  
So far, I am amazed at how much better my trading is going.  
  
I have just recently started using the Fibs and they have been working great. However I was using only the Fib Retracement tool and not the Fib Expansion tool. I would pull the Fib retracement tool and place the 0 and 100 at the top/bottom of the most recent price swing. I would then simply use the 1.382 level as my profit target.  
  
I look forward to learning your method and learning how to use the Fib Expansion tool......

Hi Tunji, Are you reffering to the swing high around the 93.92 area ? I was taking the swing high to left in consideration also which is the 94.50 area and the 4 hr chart swing high to the left. The dow looked like it was going up this morning but like you say this pair is consolidating pretty bad . I closed out with 5 pips ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) Thnaks for your help Tunji. Tex

Earlier today, we concluded today’s bias is to go Long.  
  
**The Hourly chart**(attached) is currently forming a tradable pattern. Price seems to have topped temporarily @ 1.6481. Hence, we expect price to retrace to the area between 1.6418 and 1.6355 (which is the area between the 50% and 100% fib. retracement levels – drawn from the most recent hourly swing low to the current price-top). Let’s seek to buy around this area. If price exceeds the 1.6355 level downward, our bullish bias is no more valid and we enter a no-trading zone. Our primary profit target is **@ 1.6514 (the 127% fib. ext.).**  
\----------------------------------------------------------  
Hi Tunji, in the above example you mentioned that the initial profit target is 1.0633 and you say that this is the Fib 127% extension. I crunched the numbers and it looks like it is really the 150% Fib Extension. Is that correct?  
  
I am just trying to learn to use this tool..  
  
Thanks

Hi DojiMojo, check the attachment below, I hope it’ll guide you through getting your 127% fib ext. (I guess you’re using the MT4 platform).  
If you need further clarification, please let me know.

You’re welcome Tex.   
Actually, as at the time you were using the swing high @ 94.77 area (upper blue line) to draw your fib, the new swing high @ 94.65 (lower blue line) had already formed – with two lower candles on both sides – and it was lower than the previous swing high @ 94.77. The lower swing high was simply giving us hint that the bears might’ve taken over.  
So, when the swing low @ 94.36 was broken downward, the bears proved their strength and we simply moved into a no-trade zone.  
  
Hope I answered your question?

Hi Tunji,You sure did and thanks a lot.I need to start watching more closely on the pivot highs and lows with 2 candles on each side of the middle -that is very important. I'm looking at the aud/cad on demo just for practice learning this technique. Thanks again,Tex

**On the Daily chart**(attached), price is conveniently out of and above its symmetrical triangle formation: previous swing highs are being broken to the upside. The latest swing high price closed above was a critical resistance level @ 1.4201 (which we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line), which isn’t just a Daily swing high, but also a Weekly swing high. These are lovely signs confirming a bullish or an upward-move bias. A very critical resistance is @ 1.4336 (which we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line). Let’s keep this level in mind (in relation to our profit target, in case we are eventually able to get a Long trade set-up on the Hourly chart – supported by the H4 chart).  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), the EURUSD is simply in an obvious up-trend: price keeps forming higher highs and higher lows. A trending market doesn’t get more beautiful than this. Price has broken the most recent swing high @ 1.4166 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) upward. From a day-trade perspective, this is a good sign supporting a Long trade. The green horizontal line @ 1.4062 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it – in the absence of any new and higher swing low – our bullish or upward bias remains intact.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels – to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows. Please note that our aim is to buy a dip in today’s up-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

Hi Tunji,   
Thanks for your effort really and  
enjoying all this. Few questions to ask,  
  
1\. Why 1.4062 be the most 'recent' swing low, referring to the chart, is **b.** , a swing low to you?  
  
2\. How do u define swing high/low  
Swing High- "3 bar combination, a bar preceded and succeeded by lower highs"  
Swing Low- "3 bar combination, a bar preceded and succeeded by higher lows"  
  
3\.  'in the absence of any new and **higher** swing low...'  
Should it be,'  in the absence of any new and **lower** swing low'  
  
Not trying to pick your mistake if any, just want to clarify doubts...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Cheers

This is a striking resemblance to how i trade ABCD plus fib. Nice one Tunji.  
  
I wont have to bother about starting a thread, am sure i'll be home here.  
  
I'm looking AUDUSD. Daily bias is up, so also 4hr tf making hh and hl,  
  
Presently watching 1hr tf to retrace at my fib levels (38.2-88.6) then wait for a reversal candle formation to signal me in.  
  
Do you look at candle formations?  
  
N.B. sorry i'm having problems posting charts on ff.

Use fractal indicator to identify the swing. You can find in mt4 platform.  
  
Good luck.

Hi Lefteye, these are nice questions; thanks. A swing high is a bar/candle preceded and succeeded by two lower highs (vice versa for a swing low) – thanks to my mentors… ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1).  
I hope that answered the first and second questions?  
  
For your third question: Yes! I meant “in the absence of any new and **higher swing low** ” because once a new higher swing low is formed, the new higher swing low becomes the new level price would have to break downward to nullify our bullish bias.  
  
Hope I answered your questions satisfactorily?

Trading Pure PA is far better Fractals come in late. an understanding of Trend Concepts (HH, HL; LH, LL),and patterns will do a lot of good.

Thanks Sriloba.  
  
Lefteye, you could try Sriloba’s suggestion. I’ve seen a couple of colleagues use the fractal indicator, but, for now, I’m so used to identifying the high/lows with my own eyes![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1). But, make sure the fractal identifies high/lows based on what I explained; except you prefer it otherwise, which is all good – as long as it suits you.

D liberators, you’ll definitely be at home here. You’re welcome: let’s grow together![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1).  
  
Yes, I look at candle formations, but mainly on the Daily chart and above. Observations on the H4 chart and below are, more or less, fully mechanical.

Hi All,  
  
If you were able to identify the EURUSD Long trade set-up and took the trade; that’s nice, because it happened quite fast.  
  
**The Hourly chart** (attached) shows the set-up I saw. Hope you can view the formation easily as it is very tiny and cluttered  
  
Using **the 5min chart** (attached), I’ll like to give you an idea of how I manage my trades. Yours could be slightly or completely different; it doesn’t matter – as long as it suits your personality.  
  
Based on my method, I placed my initial Stop Loss 2-pips below the most recent hourly swing low @ 1.4198 (please, where necessary, always factor in your broker’s spread)  
  
I identified two potential reversal levels at:  
fib 50% ret. @ 1.4237  
fib 78.6% ret. @ 1.4215  
  
I placed a Limit Order @ 1.4215 (I decided not to factor my broker’s spread, but I don’t always disregard it)   
  
Pls note that I don’t really like using the 50% fib. ret. level as the reward/risk ratio is always close to 1:1; and I prefer 2:1 and above (or, at least, close to 2:1)  
  
With 3 lots, I exited first lot when price moved favorably by same amount risked, which was 19pips @ the 1.4234 level (which I’ve highlighted using the blue dashed line). Then, I moved my Stop Loss to 2pips below the level where price initially reversed (hope you can see where my Stop Loss is currently). With that, my trade is already protected from loss (as in this case) or from maximum loss of 0.5% of my capital initially risked (as in other applicable cases)  
  
At times, if the pips risked is close to 50pips or more, I take some profits before it gets to the amount of pips risked OR move my Stop Loss to break-even (honestly, this aspect is simply an area everybody has to handle in their own individual ways).  
  
This is a bit lengthy, but I hope it helps.  
  
For anyone that finds this method helpful, and didn’t know much about it, it might take some time to fully settle into it, but I believe it’ll worth the time invested. Personally, though I’ve learnt a lot about it, I’m still learning every day.  
  
NOTE: Currently, as I’m about posting this, I’ve been stopped out; but I’m happy I managed the trade well enough to protect myself from loss (I’m not always that fortunate). And I always remind myself that there’s always another trade.

Yeah, I agree using candles for entries sometimes keeps one from bad trades. I was using them on the 15min chart, but I found myself more at peace with trusting the strength of support/resistance levels to reverse price in my favor. Certainly, it doesn’t always work out, but it suits me.

i'm short this pair from the daily time frame. Should have come in earlier at the 1hr tf though.  
  
daily is in short orientation in line with the weekly and 1 hr has changed from bullish to bearish orientation too.  
  
The daily gave a reversal candle formation (a variation of a bearish engulfing) at a 61.8/78.6 retracement of 160.23/146.73.

[quote=Tunji;2890777]  
Hi Tunji,  
Thanks for your time and some more questions in blue....  
Could u pls arrange yr charts vertically...  
  
.....  
Based on my method, I placed my initial Stop Loss 2-pips below the most recent hourly swing low @ 1.4198 (please, where necessary, always factor in your broker’s spread)  
  
I identified two potential reversal levels at:  
**fib 50% ret. @ 1.4237  
fib 78.6% ret. @ 1.4215**   
  
**What are yr criterias of choosing these levels beside R/R?  
Are the any significant S/R levels beside the fibs confluence 1.4217 & 1.4215?  
What is the line at 1.42128?  
**   
I placed a Limit Order @ 1.4215 (I decided not to factor my broker’s spread, but I don’t always disregard it)   
  
Pls note that I don’t really like using the 50% fib. ret. level as the reward/risk ratio is always close to 1:1; and I prefer 2:1 and above (or, at least, close to 2:1)  
  
With 3 lots, I exited first lot when price moved favorably by same amount risked, which was 19pips @ the 1.4234 level (which I’ve highlighted using the blue dashed line). Then, **I moved my Stop Loss to 2pips below the level where price initially reversed** (hope you can see where my Stop Loss is currently).   
**1.4206?**  
  
  
With that, my trade is already protected from loss (as in this case) or from maximum loss of 0.5% of my capital initially risked (as in other applicable cases)  
  
At times, if the pips risked is close to 50pips or more, I take some profits before it gets to the amount of pips risked OR move my Stop Loss to break-even (honestly, this aspect is simply an area everybody has to handle in their own individual ways).  
  
This is a bit lengthy, but I hope it helps.  
**Excellent job to me.**![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
For anyone that finds this method helpful, and didn’t know much about it, it might take some time to fully settle into it, but I believe it’ll worth the time invested. Personally, though I’ve learnt a lot about it, I’m still learning every day.

****  
****  
**Pls. NOTE:** As at the time of this posting, price had already rallied. These things happen so fast at times; but for the sake of study, I decided to go ahead and post it. Also NOTE that the rally occurred around the MPC Meetings Minutes news release: trading during news periods could be very risky, so please, if you have to trade, consider reducing your risk.  
I’m currently in the trade, but yet to know if it would turn out profitable.  
  
Although, the Daily chart isn’t offering too distinct a pattern to support a Short trade, it isn’t offering much to discourage one either.  
  
**On the H4 chart** (attached), price recently broke below a swing low @ 1.6382 (which we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line), and that automatically shifts our bias to favor a downward price move. However, let’s keep in mind a critical support level: a Daily chart swing low @ 1.6263 that is also visible on the H4 chart (this we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line).  
The white horizontal line @ 1.6556 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.  
  
**The Hourly chart**(attached) is currently forming a tradable pattern. Price seems to have bottomed temporarily @ 1.6309. Hence, we expect price to retrace to the area between 1.6363 and 1.6417 (which is the area between the 50% and 100% fib. retracement levels – drawn from the most recent hourly swing high to the current price-bottom). Let’s seek to sell around this area. If price exceeds the 1.6417 level upward, our bearish bias is no more valid and we enter a no-trading zone. Our primary profit target is @ 1.6280 (the 127% fib. ext.).  
  
Also, if price breaks below 1.6309 (current price-bottom) before retracing to the sell-area, we’ll have to redraw our Fibonacci tools using a new bottom & the most recent hourly swing high to determine new potential areas to sell.  
NOTE: Price will reach our profit target before the critical support @ 1.6263 that we discussed much earlier today – an encouraging sign. However, that would be if price didn’t break too far below the current price-bottom before retracing upward to the sell-area.  
  
**The 15min. chart**(attached) gives us a clearer view of the hourly price action and the potential areas to sell (please note it’s advisable to set a Limit order ahead of time as price could move up to these levels and reverse sharply in our favor)  
This chart is rather cluttered but if we look closely, there are a couple of potential reversal levels available. You choose your preferred level based on your personality.  
  
fib 61.8% ret. @ 1.6375;   
fib 78.6% ret. @ 1.6393 (Pls note this level doesn’t look as strong as the 61.8% ret.: the identified resistance levels around it aren’t too close together)  
  
Initial Stop Loss @ 1.6419; primary Profit target @ 1.6280 (Please remember to factor in your broker’s pip-spread).  
  
Please note that all these Fibonacci (fib.) levels have other pivots, overlapping fibs or previous highs/lows supporting them (they are the cause of this cluttered chart). As such, price could reverse at any of the points. The issue here is that the higher the fib level you choose to sell from, the smaller the pips you’ll risk and the more your pip-profit; BUT, also the more the likelihood of you missing the trade as price might not retrace that high before moving back downward.  
You need your own discretion here.  
  
Please keep your risk low. Don’t risk more than 2% of your capital. Personally, I risk about 0.5% per trade; and each trade has a potential profit target of 1% or more – based on my exit levels.  
We MUST NEVER assume we KNOW where price is going next!  
  
P.S.:   
Also, keep in mind the MPC Meeting Minutes news release at 08:30 GMT – be wary of possible price volatility during this period.

Eventually, on this trade, I had a maximum loss of almost 0.5% of my capital. However, sometimes in a lost trade, there’re one or two lessons we could gain:  
  
NOTE: I captured the attached 5min chart screen before price moved completely against me.  
  
From **the 5min chart** (attached), you would notice my Limit Order was triggered @ 1.6375 – the fib 61.8% ret. Initially, price moved in my favor by about 28pips (to around 1.6347); however this was still a bit far from my initial target-level to take profit @ 1.6328 (which I’ve highlighted using the blue dashed line) – that would’ve been 47pips profit (the amount of pips initially risked). I might also have considered taking some profits anywhere from above 30pips; and adjusting my Stop Loss afterward.  
  
The point I would like to make here is: with this method, price would often move a few pips in our favor before reversing against us – in the case of an unfavorable trade. During such periods, it’s absolutely left to us to determine the way we manage our trades.  
For some, with this same method, this particular trade could have been a break-even trade – unfortunately, not for me.  
  
The good news is my account is still well funded to comfortably take another trade – since I’m relatively very conservative at taking risks.

Have you proven this system? Meaning how long have you been trading it and whats the average win percentage?  
Reason for asking is that I don't believe one should share a system until its tested and proven to work over a particular period of time. In trading we have to think about probability, so it would be good to know if this system has stand the test of time.

Lefteye, thanks for your kind words; you’ve got lovely questions here.  
  
First, let me clarify this: what do you mean by R/R? sorry I’m not too good with abbreviations.  
  
Yes! There was a previous hourly high around the fibs confluence 1.4215 & 1.4217. Pls take your time to study the hourly chart, hopefully you’ll spot it - it’s quite obvious. I love the very distinct previous hourly highs/lows (they’re quite powerful from my experience), but in their absence, also on the hourly chart, I take a cluttered area with a number of reversal candle formations “queuing up” as a critical area of previous support/resistance.  
  
The line at 1.4212 is a weekly pivot. (I use monthly, weekly, and daily pivots)  
I hardly go for a potential reversal level that doesn’t have a confluence of two fib levels, one pivot, and a previous high/low – at most, they must only be a few pips from each other.  
  
Yes! The red dashed line @ around 1.4206

Referring to your question on post #62  
  
I always draw my fibs using hourly swing highs/lows (or even higher time frames highs/lows if possible). The 15min & 5min charts are always only used to have a clearer view of the hourly chart pattern & price action.  
Then, to achieve overlapping fibs, the bigger/secondary fib must have a level or levels close to the all or at least one of 50%, 61.8%, or 78.6% retracement levels of the smaller/primary fib; so if one swing high/low isn’t giving me that fib confluence, I look for another one, and if there’s none, I pass the trade.  
  
Hope my reply is clear enough? Thanks for your patience.

D liberators, referring to your charts on posts #55, 56, 57, 58  
  
These are lovely examples of the power of Fibonacci retracements when used to “buy dips in up-trends” or “sell rallies in down-trends.” However, I could see you don’t employ overlapping fibs. To me, overlapping fibs increase your chances of trading with a confirmed trend.  
  
The most important thing, though, is if the method suits you. To me, success in trading is primarily about our beliefs: our belief in the strength of our individual approaches, and in ourselves to ultimately succeed.  
  
Thanks; let’s keep growing.

Hello Httham, welcome to FF.   
  
Yes! The core method is well proven – it’s been in existence years before I understood the phrase “currency-trading”… lol; and I know a handful of senior colleagues that have gone ahead to become successful professional traders using variations of this method.   
If you read my initial post on this thread, you would’ve noticed I mentioned who inspired the method. I used the word “core” because all factors considered in the original method are present in this one – only that I’ve “rearranged” them to suit my personality.  
I have roughly two years trading experience, my first ever annual trading record ended last month in negligible profit – break-even so to speak. I consider that a big success in this complex world of trading. I used the method – and its variation – for most part of the previous one year. Though I’ve settled with this variation, of course, I’ll never stop learning how to use it more effectively.  
I’ve gone this far to let you have a relatively good understanding of me and the method I use. From all I’ve said, you can always make your deduction as an independent thinker, which we all have to be to succeed in trading.  
  
Httham, hope I’ve answered your question satisfactorily? Thanks for asking.

By overlapping of fibs i assume you mean fib. convergence. I do look at it especially when ts a gartley.

Yeah! I meant fib. convergence. Gartley is also a very great pattern; it, more or less, uses overlapping fibs (fibs convergence) too – only not in a trending market. I have a need for consistency: the need to settle down to a method and stay with it through thick and thin to realize all it’s got to offer - before adding another one. Otherwise, Gartley is another strategy I would’ve loved to stick with.

Very funny  
  
Well my own opinion is that this pair is very dicey at the moment.  
  
Y/day's short signal trade isnt doing too well for now  
  
And there's a likely gartley formation (sorry Tunji if this is ''off thread'') on the weekly in favour of a long signal.  
  
4hr is bearish bt presently retracing and 1hr is bullish.  
  
all these are not in a harmonic bearing.  
  
So fingers are crossed and eyes open, but i'll rather focus on other pairs for now.  
  
Am watching EG for a possible long.

NOTE:These are very challenging times for trending methods: judging from the four majors that I trade, the market simply is indecisive. Like me, if you decide to stay in the market – and not stay away – proper Trade Management is the “HOLY GRAIL” here, and with that, please let us remember to keep our risks per trade very low. Large draw downs are very difficult to recover from.  
****  
**On the Daily chart** above, price seems to be in a sustained but very sluggish upward move. Currently, price is approaching a critical resistance level @ 1.6556 (which we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line) – about 50 pips away. A break above that level would ease our concern for any major obstacle to continuous price move upward. As a moderately conservative trader, please wait for the break above 1.6556 before seeking Long trade set-up on the Hourly; as a very conservative trader, I think it’s advisable to stay completely out of the market - I’m primarily referring to the four majors that I study; however, this view probably applies to virtually all pairs as, I believe, the economic uncertainties are global issues.  
  
**On the H4 chart** Price has broken the most recent swing high @ 1.6503 (which we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line) upward. The critical resistance level @ 1.6556 that we referred to on the Daily chart is also visible on the H4 (this we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line). Please keep this level in mind. In all, from a day-trade perspective, the H4 chart is supporting a Long trade. The green horizontal line @ 1.6309 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it – in the absence of any new and higher swing low – our bullish or upward bias remains intact.  
  
However, if you decide to go Long, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels – to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows. Please note that our aim is to buy a dip in today’s up-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

My view on the USDJPY is similar to those on the other major pairs: while the H4 supports Long trade, the Daily shows price has got so many resistance levels it has to contend with to keep its upward move (looking at the attached Daily chart, we’ve got some downward trend-lines and a swing high @ 94.78). Personally, with the support of the H4, if there’s a Long trade set-up on the Hourly, I’ll go for it – but with extreme caution, and possibly, reduced risk.

Missing a beautiful trade could be frustrating at times… lol.   
Unfortunately, as you’ve probably known already, because I always employ overlapping fibs and 61.8% or 78.6% fib retracements, I wouldn’t have taken the trade – even if I was in the market. During such moments, I always need extra grace not to scold myself for identifying a lovely trade set-up and discarding it because it didn’t meet my parameters; but at least it’s helping me to be a consistent trader.

Currently, this is what is happening on the USDJPY Hourly; it doesn’t look like the most recent swing high @ 94.53 won’t be broken upward; but, if for any reason, price retraces at this point, I’ll take the trade because the 61.8% retracement of the primary fib is being supported by 50% retracement of the secondary fib, a very obvious previous swing high @ 93.85 – the exact 61.8% ret. level, and a daily pivot @ 93.75. All are within a 10-pip range.  
The major limitation here is the cluster of resistance levels on the Daily chart – a very major concern; then, I’m getting out of the market in a couple of hours. The possibility of me taking the trade is low.

Hi Guy,  
It's always easy said in the hindsight, a very nice bounce from 2 fibs+daily open.  
Where would be your SL? a. or b. or.....  
  
cheers.

MY SL depends on the tf, entry point and basically as my mm allows.  
  
For this example, it will be safer to be at b  
  
Just got stopped out of my GJ trade.

Hi Lefteye, hope my previous replies were satisfactory?  
  
This GBPUSD is a nice set-up – though I don’t know how it looks on the Hourly; but assuming you used the Hourly swing lows to draw your fibs, the automatic place where you’ll place your initial Stop Loss is just below the most recent swing low from where you drew the primary/smaller fib. According to your chart, that’ll be at point “b.”   
Also, assuming you got into this trade @ the 78.6% fib ret. level – 1.6458, and your initial SL is just below 1.6433 (less than 30pips risked), with the level price has favorably moved up to (more than 30 pips in profit), personally, I would have taken some profits, and then adjust my SL to just below 1.6453 (where price reversed). I don’t see how a trade like this would close as a losing trade – that is if your entry level was @ the 78.6% fib. ret. though.   
  
Nice one Lefteye.

**On the Daily chart**(attached), yesterday, price closed above a cluster of resistance levels, two of which were the downward trend-line (the red dashed line), and the most recent Daily swing high @ 94.77 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line). These are good signs confirming a bullish or an upward-move bias. Though, we are still within a downward channel formation, there seems to be enough room for price to venture further upward toward the 96.50 area.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken a couple of swing highs upward: the most recent swing high @ 94.37 (which we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line), and a higher previous swing high – which happens to be the same Daily swing high discussed earlier – @ 94.77 (this we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line). From a day-trade perspective, this is a good sign supporting a Long trade. The green horizontal line @ 93.07 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it – in the absence of any new and higher swing low – our bullish or upward bias remains intact.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels – to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows. Please note that our aim is to buy a dip in today’s up-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

Right on target again Tunji. I admire the knack for posting detailed analysis (i lack the patience). God bless you.  
  
A look at 1hr tf shows i would av entered earlier from 1hr tf (highlited red arrow pointing up) on a bullish engulfing at 38.2 fib, bt again, it happened during sleeping time.  
  
Am however watching to trade 4hr signal (if it happens), but will be entering from the 1hr tf, provided price retraces to 94.14/18 (marked X) or 93.92/83 where my fibs converges.  
  
What sayeth thou?

Here are my two pips on GBP/USD.  
Price on the daily tf is in an upchannel, the lower ramp of that channel. That seems pretty bullish.   
  
How about the 4h tf? Let's looks at tests of 4h swing hi's/lo's to get a directional bias.  
  
The trend on the 4h is still up -- higher highs and lows. But notice that the recent swing high forms a near double top with the prior high. That's potentially pretty bearish. Another case for shorts is the long black candle at 7.24 8:00. (See the red arrow).   
  
Per Tunji's written approach, we need to look to a test of reference points to get a better handle on a bias. Conveniently, price is situated near at least three of 'em. These are circled on the 4h chart.   
  
Two refs are pretty clear but the third might need some explaining. The first is the Fib "short" level, or the Fib62 retrace down. She's already tested that, but may need to do so again.  
  
The next ref point down is the one that might need explaining, b/c I haven't seen other people use it. I call it "X50South." It's the halfway point between the low and the close. I've done many backtests that show X50South and X50North impacting price. I believe these X50s can give us a preview of direction, especially when you watch 5 min bars making support or resistance of a higher TF X50, like daily or 4h.  
  
The last ref point on the 4h is pretty clear: it's the 4h swing low.   
  
I think if price tests at least down to 6409 and closes above, on a 4h bar, a good case for a long could be made. If that test happens, we'd still need to see, per Tunji's ideas, higher highs and lows on the 1 hour.  
  
I welcome comments on this analysis.

Joetrece, I quite understand your Daily chart analysis.   
  
Regarding the 4-Hour chart – based on the method I use – the bias is bearish. If you’ll observe closely, the 8th candle to the left (counting from the most recent candle) has got two higher candles on both sides; and that’s what defines the swing low that I use. Hence, the moment price broke below that swing low, our bias on the H4 chart turned bearish.  
  
Then, about your other analyses (including “X50South”), maybe others might like to chip-in their opinion; personally, it’s a bit unclear to me for now.

Thanks for your comment, Tunji -- you really opened my eyes. After I made my analysis, I reviewed the early part of this thread to try to see things as you do. I didn't pick out the swing low you did, after I did this. I did see the smaller low (shown with blue circle). Using this as a reference would have resulted in at least a few pips.  
  
All in all, though, I'm working to see setups from your pov. I tend to complicate things.  
  
Thanks again.

**On the Daily chart**(attached), last week, price closed above a cluster of resistance levels, two of which were the downward trend-line (the red dashed line), and the most recent Daily swing high @ 94.77 (which we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line); and has stayed above those levels. These are good signs sustaining a bullish or an upward-move bias. However, we have a new resistance level @ 95.28 (which we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line), and it would be nice to see price break this level upward to have a clearer coast. Please, I think it’s advisable to allow price break above this 95.28 level (which is just about 30 pips away) before we seek a Long trade set-up on the Hourly – supported by the H4 chart.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), also last week, price broke a number of swing highs upward; the most recent of them was the swing high @ 94.37 (which we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line). Pls NOTE: I’m not referring to the most recent swing high, but the most recent of the swing highs that price broke upward.  
From a day-trade perspective, this is a good sign supporting a Long trade. The green horizontal line @ 94.58 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it – in the absence of any new and higher swing low – our bullish or upward bias remains intact. One thing to note, however, is that price seems currently stuck between the most recent swing low @ 94.58 and _the most recent swing high_ \- the resistance level @ 95.28 (which we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line) that we discussed on the Daily chart. Personally, this range is relatively narrow for a H4 chart (just about 70pips), and, as a result, I’m willing to let price break above the resistance @ 95.28 before I seek a Long trade set-up on the Hourly.  
  
However, in case the coast eventually becomes clear enough, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels – to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows. Please note that our aim is to buy a dip in today’s up-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

Hi Tunji,  
Why didn't we take the arrowed prices as the 'most recent' swings?  
  
thanks ~o~

Lefteye, you’re absolutely correct!! Thanks. I’ve modified the H4 chart (attached).   
  
Guys, I apologize, the most recent swing low is @ 94.64 (the green horizontal line) – as against 94.58.

You’re very much welcome Joetrece; and I guess - with time - we all tend to simplify things eventually.

Hi Tunji,  
On your UJ H4 analysis, Can u explain why we take 94.37 and not 95.28 as the most recent swing high?  
  
Cheers ^o^

Lefteye, I was referring to the **most recent of the swing highs that price broke upward** – not the most recent swing high on the entire chart.  
  
Again, the most recent swing high – as you rightly observed – is @ 95.28, BUT the swing high @ 94.37 was the most recent of the swing highs that price broke.  
  
I agree the statement could be misconstrued if not read properly. It would probably be necessary to place emphasis on such statements in subsequent analyses. Thanks.

If you were able to identify the USDCHF Short trade set-up and took the trade, that’s nice. I took the trade, and I’m still in it.   
Pls NOTE: I also took a Long trade on the EURUSD, but it didn’t work out.   
Actually, the Daily charts analyses – for some time now – have often been telling us that the markets are choppy and indecisive. Hence, for more conservative traders, the analyses are good enough for them to stand aside. Personally, I’ve been reducing the percentage of capital risked per trade – until the Daily charts (and above) start giving signs that markets have started trending.  
  
Using **the Hourly chart** (attached), I’ll like to chip-in one or two insights that I hope would assist us in managing our trades. Sincerely, I believe trade-management is one of the most effective ways of ensuring the steady growth of our equity curve.  
  
I entered the trade with a Limit Order placed around the fib 61.8% ret (1.0706) – based on the confluence of overlapping fibs, a pivot, previous swing highs/lows. My initial Stop-Loss was @ 1.0740 (the most recent swing high before I entered the Short trade). As you could observe, price shot through my Limit Order @ fib. 61.8% upward, even some pips beyond the fib. 78.6% ret. before reversing.   
Currently, price is yet to move enough in my favor for me to consider taking some profits; however, the new swing high @ 1.0733 has giving me the opportunity to move my Stop-Loss lower by a few pips. It might not be much, but every chance to reduce the potential amount that could be lost in a given trade is a golden opportunity that must not be disregarded.  
  
Pls NOTE the fib 78.6% ret (1.0721) also had a confluence of overlapping fibs etc. supporting it. If you had placed your Limit Order around that level, unlike me, you would currently be having a more pleasurable time with this trade. However, you would have done that with the possibility of missing the trade.

Currently, on my USDCHF Short trade, price has moved in my favor enough for me to consider taking profit. My preferred level of taking initial profit was @ 1.0666; however, with the new doji formation around a weekly pivot, I decided to take out some profits.   
Pls NOTE I’ve adjusted my Stop Loss to just above the most recent swing high @ 1.0714.  
  
My next exit level is the primary profit target @ 1.0626 (the fib. 127% ext.)

NOTE:To me, most of the majors are still choppy and indecisive; if you decide to stay in the market – and not stay away – proper Trade Management is the “HOLY GRAIL” here, and with that, please let us remember to keep our risks per trade very low. Large draw downs are very difficult to recover from.  
  
**On the Daily chart**(attached), price is currently within an upward channel _(thanks to Joetrece’s observation)_. We expect price to continue its upward move toward the upper part of the channel. However, there’s a critical resistance level – the most recent Daily swing high - @ 1.6585 (which we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line); it would be nice to see price break above this level.  
Also NOTE that price is currently hovering around a very major year-high resistance level @ 1.6744 (which we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line). Price currently might be struggling against a possible intense selling pressure.   
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken above the most recent swing high @ 1.6523 (which we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line). From a day-trade perspective, this is a good sign supporting a Long trade. The green horizontal line @ 1.6380 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it – in the absence of any new and higher swing low – our bullish or upward bias remains intact.   
The resistance level @ 1.6585 that also happens to be the Daily swing high discussed earlier (which we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line) is quite important. The less aggressive traders might have to wait to see price break above this level before seeking a Long trade set-up on the Hourly.   
  
However, regardless of our individual decisions, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels – to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows. Please note that our aim is to buy a dip in today’s up-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

Here is an overlapping Fibs at the same area where Weekly R1 is plus broken resistance (0.8212). I'll be watching that area for possible entry.

That’s a nice set-up; but, did you deliberately ignore the most recent swing low just below the 0.8212 level?

I see what you saying. I drew the fibs on 4HR chart first so the swings look a little more obvious there. There are a quite a few swings on the 1HR chart. I went short this morning after triple top and reverse candle on Euro. I figured this is going to drag Aussie down with it.

Based on earlier analysis today, if you took a less aggressive position on the GBPUSD pair (also the EURUSD and USDCHF pairs), and waited for price to break the resistance level @ 1.6585 upward before seeking a Long trade set-up on the Hourly chart. Kudos! You succeeded in protecting yourself from a losing trade.  
Also, if you identified the trade set-up on the Hourly chart (attached), and entered the trade around fib. 78.6% ret. @ 1.6476, you probably were able to manage your trade well enough to avoid loss.  
  
I entered the trade around fib. 61.8% ret. @ 1.6493. Hence, I lost the trade; however, with a risk less than 0.5% of my capital.  
  
For those of us employing trending methods, we need to fully understand the current market environment as that would protect us from seeking the HOLY GRAIL; and let’s always strive to keep learning about the strengths and weaknesses of our individual methods.

Using higher time-frames to draw fibs isn’t a bad idea since the higher the time-frame, the stronger the fib retracement levels.  
  
Though I don’t trade the aussie, I won’t be surprised if it has plunged: seems the dollar is rallying broadly.

I thought about taking this trade as you brought it up yesterday but I saw signs of divergence that made me hesitant. Plus doing a little volume analysis on 4HR it appeared the bias is short. But as you said managing properly would've avoided loss.

Yeah, I notice those divergences at times, but I basically use them to weigh the strength of a set-up and see if I should reduce my risk & manage the trade more cautiously; but they don’t necessarily keep me entirely out of a trade once my set-up is in place.  
Divergence is powerful, but, overtime, I concluded there would always be one reason or the other to keep off a trade, so I’ve tried to make my parameters as mechanical as possible.

You’re out already?!! But here on my chart (attached), price hasn’t travelled up to your adjusted Stop Loss.   
Well, trading platforms differ. That was a lovely trade you took – with nice trade-management. I love your H4 analysis too.  
  
Although, I just realized that the swing high you used to draw your fib slightly missed the first lower candle on its left side (the first “lower” candle on the left was actually about 1-pip higher); but, all the same, it was great trade!

Hi Tunji, Thanks for the compliment. Your are exactly right 1 pip higher on stop loss and would have still been in. Anyway there will be more trades .I just don't won't to risk too much with these markets like they are. I was expecting this to run to at least down to the 94.00 (61.8 level of the 4hr) or so level but we can't predict. Also we have been stuck at 61.8 level of the last swing on the daily so that gave me some probability if it did break the 7/27 daily candle we could go lower - we did but it didn't move as i expected. Keep up the good work Tunji i do like your analysis . Tex

I was expecting this to run to at least down to the 94.00 (61.8 level of the 4hr) or so level but we can't predict. Also we have been stuck at 61.8 level of the last swing on the daily so that gave me some probability if it did break the 7/27 daily candle we could go lower - we did but it didn't move as i expected. Keep up the good...

**On the Daily chart**(attached), as a result of a broad dollar rally yesterday, price has broken the upward channel downward. We expect price to continue its downward move for the time being. There’s a support level – the most recent Daily swing low - @ 1.6309 (which we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line); Let’s keep this level in mind when managing our trades (in case we eventually identify a Short trade set-up on our Hourly charts – supported by the H4 chart).  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing low @ 1.6389 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) downward. From a day-trade perspective, this is a good sign supporting a Short trade. The white horizontal line @ 1.6555 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.   
  
However, we still need our hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our short positions. Price pattern on the hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows; and note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

Earlier today, we concluded today’s bias is to go short.  
  
**The Hourly chart**(attached) is currently forming a tradable pattern. Price seems to have bottomed temporarily @ 1.6345. Hence, we expect price to retrace to the area between 1.6406 and 1.6467 (which is the area between the 50% and 100% fib. retracement levels – drawn from the most recent hourly swing high to the current price-bottom). Let’s seek to sell around this area. If price exceeds the 1.6467 level upward, our bearish bias is no more valid and we enter a no-trading zone. Our primary profit target is @ 1.6312 (the 127% fib. ext.).  
  
Also, if price breaks below 1.6345 (current price-bottom) before retracing to the sell-area, we’ll have to redraw our Fibonacci tools using a new bottom & the most recent hourly swing high to determine new potential areas to sell.  
  
**The 15min. chart**(attached) gives us a clearer view of the hourly price action and the potential areas to sell (please note it’s advisable to set a Limit order ahead of time as price could move up to these levels and reverse sharply in our favor).  
This chart is rather cluttered but if we look closely, there are a number of potential reversal levels available. You choose your preferred level based on your personality.   
  
fib 50% ret. @ 1.6406;  
fib 61.8% ret. @ 1.6421;   
fib 78.6% ret. @ 1.6441.  
  
(Personally, the 50% and 61.8% ret. levels are weak compared to the 78.6% ret. level as the confluences at both levels are not as strong as that of 78.6% - I might set my Limit Order just below the pivot @ 1.6437, which is just a few pips from fib 78.6%)  
  
Initial Stop Loss @ 1.6469; primary Profit target @ 1.6312 (Please remember to factor in your broker’s pip-spread).  
  
Please note that all these Fibonacci (fib.) levels have other pivots, overlapping fibs or previous highs/lows supporting them (they are the cause of this cluttered chart). As such, price could reverse at any of the points. The issue here is that the higher the fib level you choose to sell from, the smaller the pips you’ll risk and the more your pip-profit; BUT, also the more the likelihood of you missing the trade as price might not retrace that high before moving back downward.  
You need your own discretion here.  
  
Please keep your risk low. Don’t risk more than 2% of your capital. Personally, I risk about 0.5% per trade; and each trade has a potential profit target of 1% or more – based on my exit levels.  
We MUST NEVER assume we KNOW where price is going next!  
  
P.S.:   
Always keep in mind any major news releases. Be wary of possible price volatility during these periods.

1.6437 area is where I set my limit. There is a pretty good Gartley setup at that level that's within 5 pips of 78.6 retracement level.

Mike, you’re absolutely correct; I could identify the Gartley too – very visible on the 15min and 5min charts.

Guys, isn’t it lovely to see the way price reacts to these levels?   
  
NOTE: I’m not in any way saying the 78.6% level will hold; nobody knows that.

In simple terms it's where Fib retracements and extensions overlap. Look for them at S/R areas or Pivots. You can do a Google search for more information.

Mike, thanks for the explanation.  
  
@ Lefteye & Jeffokes  
The attached chart might help a bit, but I believe the link Mike posted should clarify it a lot further.  
  
You’ll notice that – apart from the major fib (in brown) – there’s a fib in purple drawn in a reverse order; then, its fib 127% ext. and 161.8% ext. levels almost align with the 61.8% ret. and 78.6% ret. levels of the major fib. respectively.  
The confluence (overlap) is called Gartley.

(1)what I see there is Fibonacci Expansion and not extension,are they same?  
(2)I know this is not a tutorial session but I want to learn how to use the tool,can any1 help with where I can get relevant info?And possibly get a custon Fib Extension to install on my platform?  
  
Sorry for bothering you guys,as u can see I am a newbie still demo trading.

I don't use any custom Fib extension. You have to add the Fib extension to your FIB Retracement tools. 1.217 level is "-0.27". 1.618 is "-0.618". If you want to see the price next it add %$ to the description tab. Here is a screenshot.

Personally I wouldnt consider this a gartley seen that it retrace all the back to the 100 of the down swing.

This is a valid Gartley. The price never broke below 1.6345. At least on my platform.

On the chart Tunji posted, after the bounce at the 78.6 from the up swing the market rally all the way to the 100(1.6467) of the down swing where he drew the fibs, I dont consider that a Gartley.

I see what you are saying now. You are referring to the double top. At the time the setup occurred we didn't know the price would go that far. I personally leave my stops at the very least 20 pips away from the up swing. Whether it is a potential Gartley or anything else. The market makers don't care about these patterns. They know where these stops are. It is a shame to miss making a profit for a couple of pips.

The chart posted below is a Gartley pattern by how I was taught. A gartley is a convergence of a fib retracement and a natural fib extension from a smaller swing. The chart below shows the market retrace to the 50 from the major swing in the direction of the trend. In that retracement was a smaller swing that retrace to the 61.8 and then goes to the natural 161.8(0.618) fib extension. Hope that helps.

On the Cable setup today there were other swings you could use to draw your Gartley and find the perfect match. The point is where do you want to sell and find the confluence. It is easy to say something is not what it is after the fact. But as I said we didn't know the price would make a double top at the time. The trade worked after all so I hope you took it.

I agree, I use reversal candle patterns to determine the convergence level.

Jeffokes,  
  
I, too, don’t use (or know of) any custom fib ext.; and it’s most likely that Fibonacci “expansion” is the same as “extension” – though I’m not in any way sure.  
Also, try to make inquiries on it from your trading platform provider.  
  
Please check post #39 of this thread too, it’s got an attachment that might help.

Httham, thanks for your insight. Just as Rumba explained, the Gartley was identified before the ensuing price action. You would notice my emphasis was on the confluence – not price.

Jeffokes, I’ve attached the MT4 fib window; if your MT4 works in a similar way, just double-click your fibonacci tool, then right click on it and choose ‘fibo properties,’ a window similar to this attachment should appear on your screen; so, from there this attachment should guide you. Hope this helps.   
  
Gartley is just another method for identifying possible price reversal levels. It’s not a primary parameter for this method, but the more price/chart patterns you understand, the better you’ll be at analyzing the market; and market analysis will help you a lot in trading.

**On the Daily chart**(attached), yesterday, the dollar continued its broad rally. Consequently, on EURUSD, price broke and closed below a strong support level – the most recent Daily swing low @ 1.4118 (which we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line). Also, though price is still within an upward channel, there seems to be room for further movement downward toward the 1.3950 area. These price actions support a bearish or downward bias.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing low @ 1.4130 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) downward. From a day-trade perspective, this is a good sign supporting a Short trade. The white horizontal line @ 1.4194 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.   
  
However, we still need our hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows; and note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

This might worth a look if price retraces that far. On 1HR price broke out of resistance level. Overlapping fibs around 95.00 level plus weekly pivot.

Yeah; a Weekly pivot and major fib. 61.8% supporting fib. 78.6% @ 95.00  
  
Then, a Daily pivot, previous swing high, major fib. 50% supporting fib 61.8% @ 95.15

Guys, here’s how the USDJPY Long trade set-up looks on the Hourly. The Daily and H4 charts currently support the Long trade too.  
  
Thanks Mike for posting the set-up.  
  
P.S.:  
There’s also a Long trade set-up forming on USDCHF with support confluence @ 1.0859 (fib. 78.6% ret.).

Good article Tunji and thanks. I see a small lower swing high on the 15 min chart on the usd/chf at the 38.2 fib - if this plays out to the downside this should put us right around the weekly pivot,and if it goes to the 161.8 level it will be around 0844 to .0850. Hopefully will get a boost of momentum to the upside around that area. Will just have to see.

Hi Tunji,  
I really can't see this near these level, mine weekly pivot ~ 94.36  
last week data,  
H= 95.281  
L= 93.078  
C= 94.728  
Is this tally with yours?

Thanks Tex. Yeah, you’re probably correct. Please, as much as it’s possible, try to attach the charts as it would help us fully understand your observation.

Lefteye, only the Close is slightly different. You’re right: there’s the central pivot @ 94.38, then RI pivot @ 95.68. I guess the issue is you don’t use the M levels (mid-way level between pivots); there’s M3 pivot @ 95.03. The M level is from Peter Bain ([www.forexmentor.com](http://www.forexmentor.com/)) and it’s available on the FX Solutions trading platform. You can also calculate them yourself by finding the pivots’ mid levels.  
  
P.S.:  
Guys, I hope posting “commercial” links is not violating any FF rules? I’m not profiting from it.

Great observation; although, since we still have roughly 100-pip space, I think it’s still somewhat safe to seek Long trade set-up on the Hourly – if the Daily and H4 support a Long trade.

Pls NOTE: **On the Weekly chart** , as earlier observed and posted by Lefteye, let us be wary of resistance pressure on price as it advances toward the upper part of a downward channel.  
  
**On the Daily chart**(attached), price recently broke the most recent swing high @ 95.37 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) upward. This signals the possibility of further price movement upward. As we could see, price is within a downward channel – which is also visible on the Weekly chart – hence, let’s be wary of a downside pressure as price moves further upward toward the upper edge of the channel. There’s roughly a 100-pip space between current price position and the channel’s upper edge; I believe that, from a day-trade perspective, it’s still relatively safe to seek a Hourly Long trade set-up – supported by the H4 chart.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing high @ 95.35 (which we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line) upward. A resistance level – the previous day high @ 95.86 (which we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line) is a level we might like to keep in mind, and probably want broken. In all, from a day-trade perspective, the H4 chart is supporting a Long trade. The green horizontal line @ 94.00 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it – in the absence of any new and higher swing low – our bullish or upward bias remains intact.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels – to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows. Please note that our aim is to buy a dip in today’s up-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

Tex, I guess you’re in a Short trade? Please manage your trade properly; the Short bias on the H4 chart (attached) is no more valid. The most recent swing @ 1.4095 has been broken upward.  
Minimizing our losses is an excellent way to trade in certain circumstances.

My entry level for Euro was 1.4154. I missed getting in by 1 pip. But I will be watching the price action on shorter time frame and get in if I see another sign. Other than overlapping Fibs there is also a Gartley there plus weekly M2.

Mike, you’re talking about a very valid Gartley set-up on the Hourly & H4 charts that supports a Short trade on the EURUSD. Though, a Short trade is valid from that point of view, but you know it contradicts this method’s bias. I think we should be careful not to confuse newer traders among us.  
You know there are limitless ways to interpret the market and contradictory positions on the same pair could still end up in profit - if they're both managed properly; but let’s try and keep the focus of the thread.

My thoughts for Aug. 3 trades are  
  
1\. EU---- Monthly orientation is up, so is Wkly and Daily.  
4hr has changed to an up orientation as well as 1hr.  
  
So i'll be looking for a long signal on 1hr/15mins. tf.

D liberators, happy new month! You’re quite right, the most recent Weekly swing high has been broken upward, and H4 chart supports Long trades. Definitely, these are bullish signs and we should consider seeking Long trade set-ups on the Hourly chart.  
However, price is hovering around the year high @ 1.4336, which is a very critical resistance level: Let’s just keep that in mind.

**On the Daily chart**(attached), price recently broke a very major resistance level – the year high @ 1.6744 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) upward. This signals the possibility of further price movement upward. To me, this single price action is major enough to be the only analysis on the GBPUSD Daily chart for today.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing high @ 1.6525 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) upward. This automatically shifts our bias in favor of an upward price move. The green horizontal line @ 1.6471 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it – in the absence of any new and higher swing low – our bullish or upward bias remains intact.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels – to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows. Please note that our aim is to buy a dip in today’s up-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

Hello Tunji,  
  
I have my weekly R level at 1.4337, so i agree with you. (forgive my lack of patience for posting detailed analysis.  
  
My bias for GJ is long so i''ll be watching for more signals to go long (1 signal already done 100+ pips)  
  
Wish you all a happy and pipful August.

Earlier today, we concluded today’s bias is to go Long.  
  
**The Hourly chart**(attached) is currently forming a tradable pattern. Price seems to have topped temporarily @ 1.6879. Hence, we expect price to retrace to the area between 1.6787 and 1.6695 (which is the area between the 50% and 100% fib. retracement levels – drawn from the most recent hourly swing low to the current price-top). Let’s seek to buy around this area. If price exceeds the 1.6695 level downward, our bullish bias is no more valid and we enter a no-trading zone. Our primary profit target is @ 1.6928 (the 127% fib. ext.).  
  
Also, if price breaks above 1.6879 (current price-top) before retracing to the buy-area, we’ll have to redraw our Fibonacci tools using a new top & the most recent hourly swing low to determine new potential areas to buy.  
  
**The 15min. chart**(attached) gives us a clearer view of the Hourly price action and the potential areas to buy (please note it’s advisable to set a Limit order ahead of time as price could move down to these level and reverse sharply in our favor)  
This chart is rather cluttered but if we look closely, there is just a single potential reversal level available (quite unusual):  
  
fib 78.6% ret. @ 1.6735.   
(Actually, the fib 78.6% ret. is about 12 pips away from its supporting overlapping major fib 38.2% ret., but, considering the strong confluence, which also includes three pivots and a previous Hourly swing high – six supports – the set-up looks too beautiful to ignore)  
  
Initial Stop Loss @ 1.6693; primary Profit target @ 1.6928 (Please remember to factor in your broker’s pip-spread).  
  
Please keep your risk low. Don’t risk more than 2% of your capital. Personally, I risk about 0.5% per trade; and each trade has a potential profit target of 1% or more – based on my exit levels.  
We MUST NEVER assume we KNOW where price is going next!  
  
P.S.:   
Also, always keep in mind any major news releases. Be wary of possible price volatility during these periods.

Guys, I hope you’ll agree with me that today has simply been a test of patience – no significant retracements on the majors; but the possible good news is we might finally be getting out of the wearing ranging markets.  
  
@ D liberators  
I’m quite sure patience had her way with you today… ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1). Well, the day isn’t completely over; though, that’s for those that’ll still be in the market.

**On the Monthly chart**(attached), we could see price has conveniently broken above the **very** major fib. 38.2% retracement level @ 1.6427 – after two months of struggle. Price is now set to test the fib. 50% ret. level @ 1.7331. However, there is a critical resistance level – a previous distinct swing low @ 1.7050 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line); this level might pose a major barrier for the current upward price move, and we might see price struggling against an intense resistance pressure. Please let’s keep this critical level in mind.  
  
**On the Daily chart**(attached), yesterday, price decisively broke a very major resistance level – now previous year-high @ 1.6744 (which we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line) upward. This sustains our bias in favor of further price movement upward. However, the critical resistance level @ 1.7050 (which we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line) that was seen on the Monthly chart has been shown here, so as for us to fully grasp its proximity to the current price level: it’s not too far away, so, again, please let’s keep this critical resistance in mind.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), since yesterday, price has doggedly continued its rally – refusing to relax enough for any significant retracement; hence, the green horizontal line @ 1.6471, which highlights the most recent swing low has not budged since last week Friday (or since last month, so to speak). While all these sustain our bias in favor of an upward price move, as indicated by the most recent candles formations (a doji and an inside candle), we are probably about to experience a major downward retracement. Though the higher time frames support going Long, let’s be careful about taking a Long position for now.   
The beauty of this particular method – discussed in this thread – is that the Hourly higher-high-higher-low parameter (and vice versa), to a very good extent, prevents us from making a right move at the wrong time.  
  
In all, our analyses on the Monthly, Daily, and H4 charts support Long trades; but, again, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels – to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows. Please note that our aim is to buy a dip in today’s up-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing low @ 94.57 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) downward. This automatically shifts our bias in favor of a downward price move. As a complementary signal, price closed below a strong upward trend-line – as shown on the chart.  
The white horizontal line @ 95.44 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.  
  
**The Hourly chart**(attached) is currently forming a tradable pattern. Price seems to have bottomed temporarily @ 94.34. Hence, we expect price to retrace to the area between 94.89 and 95.44 (which is the area between the 50% and 100% fib. retracement levels – drawn from the most recent hourly swing high to the current price-bottom). Let’s seek to sell around this area. If price exceeds the 95.44 level upward, our bearish bias is no more valid. Our primary profit target is @ 94.05 (the 127% fib. ext.).  
  
Also, if price breaks below 94.34 (current price-bottom) before retracing to the sell-area, we’ll have to redraw our Fibonacci tools using a new bottom & the most recent Hourly swing high to determine new potential areas to sell.  
  
**The 15min. chart**(attached) gives us a clearer view of the Hourly price action and the potential areas to sell (please note it’s advisable to set a Limit order ahead of time as price could move up to these level and reverse sharply in our favor)  
This chart is rather cluttered but if we look closely, there are a number of potential reversal levels available. You choose your preferred level based on your personality.  
  
fib 50% ret. @ 94.89;   
fib 61.8% ret. @ 95.02;  
fib 78.6% ret. @ 95.21.   
  
Initial Stop Loss @ 95.46; primary Profit target @ 94.05 (Please remember to factor in your broker’s pip-spread).  
  
Please note that all these Fibonacci (fib.) levels have other pivots, overlapping fibs or previous highs/lows supporting them (they are the cause of this cluttered chart). As such, price could reverse at any of the points. The issue here is that the higher the fib level you choose to sell from, the smaller the pips you’ll risk and the more your pip-profit; BUT, also the more the likelihood of you missing the trade as price might not retrace that high before moving back downward.  
You need your own discretion here.  
  
Please keep your risk low. Don’t risk more than 2% of your capital. Personally, I risk about 0.5% per trade; and each trade has a potential profit target of 1% or more – based on my exit levels.  
We MUST NEVER assume we KNOW where price is going next!  
  
P.S.:   
Please keep in mind any major news releases. Be wary of possible price volatility during these periods.

D liberators, you're quite right. I think your approach is nice for a longer term trade.

Thanks Tunji.  
  
4hrs and daily trades are indeed long term (in most cases), but i like trading 1hr off daily and 4hr trend direction.   
  
Today's been dull, thats why posted the higher tf signal, perhaps we might get some action from there. (sorry if its not meeting your intraday strategy approach-just say so and i'll remove the posting)

D liberators, there’s no need to remove your posting at all. While you’re right that your analysis didn’t align with the primary method discussed on this thread, I’ll always appreciate your comments – and everybody’s comments. They all make us better traders.  
  
Actually, the reason I would like us to keep the focus of this thread, as much as possible, is to aid our individual consistency.  
Most traders, including me, struggle with consistency due to the random nature of the markets, or, to put it in another way, the limitless ways the markets express themselves – testing our patience and discipline in the process.  
Over and over again, successful veteran and professional traders advocate consistency. Most of them have more than one trading strategy, but I believe they didn’t familiarize themselves with all the strategies at once.  
  
@ All  
  
I hope you all understand: your complementary inputs are deeply appreciated. Please let’s keep learning and keep taking these steps together – one at a time.  
  
And, I apologize for this wordy post.

Pls lets keep it simple  
lets keep the limit of possible trade discussion within the scope  
defined by the thread starter.  
  
i think the guy is focused and wonna show consistency with his approach and moreover newbies will love it that way.  
  
lets keep our longterm analysis or post somewhere and lets keep this thread as simple as the thread starter wanted it.

Hello Superscalper, I’ve been trading this way (and its variations) for over six months, but until recently, I’ve not been consistent with it. In the last twelve-month period, I recorded a negligible profit – breakeven, so to speak. I believe being consistent will enhance the steady growth of my equity curve – as well as other traders’; hence, the need for this thread.  
  
@ Naijafx  
  
Thanks for your contribution.

**Pls NOTE:** The majors seem to be currently “sleeping:” nothing much to discuss in terms of bias.  
  
Based on yesterday’s analysis, if you positioned yourself for the USDJPY Short trade set-up, regardless of the level you chose to enter your trade, your Limit Order would’ve been filled.  
The trade, however, turned out to be a very “sluggish” trade – in terms of it moving in our favor; but the good news is it offered us the opportunity to reduce our initial risk, while holding on to our primary profit target – indirectly, exponentially increasing our reward:risk ratio.  
Personally, I believe a very good trade-management skill is much better than a very good trading method: bad trade-management will turn the best of trading methods to a loser-strategy. That’s my personal opinion though; but I believed it is a view shared by most of us. Unlike my trading method, my trade-management approach is still a work-in-progress.  
  
Please note that as much as I appreciate this thread’s focus on the primary method discussed, I also appreciate diverse ideas on trade-management. Unlike trading methods, I believe there’re hardly any two persons that manage their trades exactly the same way, but we can learn from each other.  
  
Consequently, I’ll like to explain the few steps I took in managing the USDJPY Short trade:  
  
**On the Daily chart**(attached), yesterday, though price convincingly broke the upward trend-line downward, it reversed sharply to close above it. That, to me, is enough cause for concern that price might be reversing upward.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), further confirming the Daily chart price action, price seems to be having a hard time staying below the upward trend-line as the last full candle closed on the trend-line – not exactly below it.   
  
**On the Hourly chart**(attached), most recent candle pattern (a quasi “Railway-track”) suggests imminent price retracement upward – not necessarily a complete reversal; but in the light of the higher time frames, I decided to monitor the Short trade more closely.  
  
**On the 15min chart**(attached), I drew a new Fibonacci from the most recent Hourly swing high @ 95.38 to the current-bottom @ 94.85 to identify a possible retracement level that might halt the current upward move of price. Price moved up to the fib 38.2% ret. @ 95.05 (very close to confluence of fib 50% ret. @ 95.11 and a previous Hourly swing low also @ 95.11), and then formed a 15min reversal candle (hammer).  
With the “story” price was telling – keeping in mind the upward pressure on price on higher time frames, I moved my Stop Loss to 2 pips above the reversal candle (I also factored in my broker’s spread) when price moved downward by 9 pips in profit, which equaled to the same number of pips between the new Stop Loss and my Entry level. At the same time, I took off half of my position (I had 2 lots). At that moment, the worst that would happen was for me to end the trade in breakeven – which was exactly what eventually happened.  
  
I hope the above explanation is clear enough. Sincerely, there’s no right or wrong way to manage our trades. That’s why I appreciate unrestricted conversation regarding trade-management.  
I’m only trying to follow Warren Buffett’s hint: **Rule number one, don’t lose money. Rule number two, don’t forget rule number one. Rule number three, don’t go into debt. **  
As I said, my trade-management approach is still a work-in-progress. I’m beginning to accept the fact that if a trade would earn me maximum profit, it should do it without giving me unnecessary hassle. I only need a few trades with maximum profits to be profitable – as long as I keep my losses very low in an informed manner.  
  
I apologize for this very lengthy explanation.

I'll like to suggest we get a trading/trainning room where you could teach, in between waiting for signals.  
  
I believe this way will be faster to learn and improve.

![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)Teaching is way beyond me for now; let me have years of record to prove myself first. Fortunately, by then, I won’t be teaching anybody currently around – since we would’ve all become successful traders in our own rights.  
  
I’m currently in a GBPUSD Long trade (Hourly and 15min charts attached). I wasn’t too confident of the set-up, partly due to heavy news releases between 12:15GMT & 14:00GMT. I reduced my risk; currently, I’ve moved my Stop Loss to break-even as price moved in my favor by almost the same amount of pips initially risked. So, worst case scenario is no-loss-no-gain.   
  
My Entry @ 1.6943 (using the daily pivot between overlapping fibs @ 61.8% ret. & 78.6% ret.);   
Initial Stop Loss @ 1.6898;   
Primary profit target @ 1.7080.

i have learned a lot about different strategies over the past 3 years. The truth is, almost all of them work...In my opinion Fibonacci the bottom line in any trading method. the key to any strategy is discipline and correct money management.... I manage other account besides my own...here is the key to my money mangement... I trade mostly the first of the month...once i get up 300 to 500 pips...i stop, till the next month. Simplistic you might say...but i tell you it makes a difference. Many traders get so involved in trying to play catch up from week to week. For example...you traded all week...spent countless hours in screen time..and you blow it all on friday...well sunday night you feel you are starting in the hole and need to do whatever it takes to regain your losses and make some money the next week...so you start making stupid trades and breaking your discipline...it sound simple...but i am telling you it is much practical as it is psychological...there is a little more to it...but that the gist of it....If you can trade positive month after month...then it is not a matter of "if" you will be prosperous but rather "when" you will be prosperous...  
  
another note...if any of you guys trading live would be intrested in pip rebate....let me know...i might can hook you up.

Jeffokes, you’re much welcome; I’m sure that once every one of us understood fully a major goal of this thread, virtually all inputs would be complementary and helpful. Certain inputs from more experienced traders might not always be easily understood at first (just like a Gartley pattern Rumba identified on the 15min chart in a previous post), but they could be very helpful: gaining additional insights within the context of the thread’s primary method could go a long way in helping us to grasp further the dynamic nature of the markets.

Hello all,  
Find this a really good thread.  
Has been very educational for me with regard to fibs, I trade medium term   
and use candle chart analysis.  
I would like to add a little here, hopefully it will help.  
  
Although cable has seem to be an express train I have noticed the daily high/low range is getting smaller and we had a doji on the 4th.  
Hope my little observation is of help here   
  
regards  
  
gamma

**Pls NOTE:** I believe all the majors are simply waiting for the major news announcements: Rate announcements, etcetera, from Europe & Britain today; NFP, etcetera, from US tomorrow. At the other extreme, we might experience intense volatility. Let’s be of wary this current environment.  
  
**On the Daily chart**(attached), price is hovering around the upper part of what I believe is referred to as a rising wedge (I’m still learning about the formation). Based on the recent “doji” candles formation, we would notice the last two days ended indecisively. There is a possibility price would want to break above the wedge – based on fundamental leaning; there’s also a possibility price might want to retrace to the lower side. There seems to be a need for catalyst here. In short, the market is currently indecisive.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), it’s pretty obvious the market has been hibernating for days; we need active movement to have an informed bias.  
  
**On the Hourly chart**(attached), market’s very subdued activity is just very visible. I believe patience is the key here.

Hello Gamma, it’s great that you find this thread helpful. You’re absolutely free to contribute to our learning process. Just as with other threads, we’re here to learn. To maintain consistency, it would be very much appreciated if your contributions complement the primary method discussed on the thread. I believe that, by limiting the methods we discuss, we’re able to explore, in depth, other important areas that make up a well-rounded trading system, which include the overall view of the market (which you just did in simple words), trading psychology, and the very important various trade-management approaches.  
  
Thanks for the insightful input you just made, and I hope we all grow in this trading business together.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Hi again Tunji,  
There is a point where the fibs interact with pricing we normally have a precuser to that.pivots/doji /support /resistance, which can also result in confluence.  
The fib points gives us areas of price to watch and price action determines that action.  
I am not very good on the fibs as I am never too sure which high/low to use and time frame.  
  
Hopefully I can follow this thread and input some price action which I hope helps all.  
Not wanting to sway the thread in any way please let me know if we do not want to use price action I will not be offended, I am here to learn more about fibs.

Gamma, to avoid any misunderstanding, please explain, further, what you mean by price action; because swing highs/lows are results of price action, so, in that sense, we use price action.  
  
If what you mean by price action is different, please clarify. Thanks.

**Pls NOTE:** If there’s one particular day in every month that trending method/pattern traders should be wary of trading most, it has to be the first Fridays of every month when the Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) report is usually released. Early market hours are usually dull; afterward, usually around the news release, we have extreme volatility, which disrupts any recognizable chart patterns; hence, the entire trading day becomes virtually un-tradable. At least, that has been my personal experience.  
While I’ll go ahead to give my personal analysis on the EURUSD pair, please, let’s bear in mind that, regardless of any technical analyses, NFP usually rules today.  
  
**On the Daily chart**(attached), yesterday, after two days of indecision (as shown by previous “dojis”) price broke previous days’ lows (Tuesday and Wednesday’s lows) downward. In addition, the price reversal happened around the upper edge of what I believe is referred to as a rising wedge pattern. To me, these signal the possibility of further price movement downward.   
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing low @ 1.4355 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) downward. This automatically shifts our bias in favor of a downward price move. The white horizontal line @ 1.1.4447 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

Hi D liberators, your analyses on the H4 and Hourly charts are quite nice and understandable to me; but I need clarification on the Daily chart regarding why you chose the 0.8697 & 0.8399 levels – and not other levels – to determine the invalidation and continuation of downtrend, respectively.  
Also on the Daily chart, why do you need upward retracement of at least four candles to disrupt the downtrend?  
  
Please know that my questions are unbiased: I just want to be able to see what you saw. Thanks.

I had a limit order setup for Euro that was filled and closed today. I thought I share it with the group. Hopefully it can be informative.   
The first line chart shows the channel I was following. I was looking for a close outside the channel. The close occurred yesterday so I looked for pullback and entry at the breakout area. There was an overlapping Fib at the 38.2 retracement of the major move. It is not shown on the chart to avoid clutter. My limit @ 1.4375 was filled earlier today. Before NFP I widened my stop not to get shaken out and before I knew it I was out of the trade.

im just wondering your limit order? was it for a short or long.. looks like short, but when you said you were out of your trade was it a gain or a loss? it wasn't every clear.. looking at your chart it could have been either as the markets went crazy last night heheheh.

I thought it was self explanatory with charts and everything else. It was a short trade. My bias was short. I was looking for a short breakout. I got out at 1.217 fib extension. This could've been a bigger gain but I'm not that greedy. I don't usually trade during NFP but I figured it was a reasonably safe trade considering the distance between the price and the swing high at 8:30 AM EST.

> Hi D liberators, your analyses on the H4 and Hourly charts are quite nice and understandable to me; but I need clarification on the Daily chart regarding why you chose the 0.8697 & 0.8399 levels – and not other levels – to determine the invalidation and continuation of downtrend, respectively.  
>  Also on the Daily chart, why do you need upward retracement of at least four candles to disrupt the downtrend?

Sorry Tunji, av been off forum for a while.  
  
I usually prefer my wave length to have at least 4 candles (this is just a personal preference and does not apply to all cases.).  
  
As per my low and high levels, i try to determine the most recent ABCD and go with the wave orientation in that line. A high point/candle will have at least 2 low candles to the left and 2 low candles to the right and as earlier said i look for my wave lenght to contain at least 4 candles.  
  
I dont know if i make sense.

Thanks D liberators; I might not fully understand your analysis, but since it doesn’t contradict the primary trading parameters discussed, it’s certainly an opportunity for me, and, I believe, others that are not acquainted with this type of chart analysis to learn it and decide, individually, if it could be of any benefit.  
  
@ All  
  
I wish us all Godspeed this new week.

**On the Weekly chart**(attached), a major resistance level – a previous swing low @ 1.7050 (that we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line), which we discussed on the Monthly chart during last week Tuesday analysis, did a very solid job of "stopping the bulls in their tracks." As we could see, price action last week ended in a reversal candle formation (a hammer). A reversal candle forming around a strong resistance level, after a protracted upward price movement, is a strong signal that price might be reversing downward. Although, price left the fib. 38.2% retracement “station” and is yet to reach the next fib. “station” @ fib. 50% ret., other factors are, currently, overwhelmingly in favor of a downward move.   
  
**On the Daily chart**(attached), the bias for downward price move is strengthened further with a Waving negative MACD Divergence (which we’ve identified using the red dashed lines on the upper and lower windows of the trading platform). A Waving MACD Div. becomes a valid divergence only when MACD crosses below its Signal Line; nevertheless, a Waving –ve MACD Div. informs us of the possibility of an imminent price move downward. The demand or upward trend-line is currently about a hundred pips away from current price position; hence we believe there’s still ample room for price downward move – from a day-trade perspective. While we should be wary of a strong support as price moves further downward toward the upward trend-line, let’s also note that, in case price eventually closed below the trend line, further bearish move – in light of other analysis – is strongly expected.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing low @ 1.6649 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) downward. This automatically shifts our bias in favor of a downward price move. The white horizontal line @ 1.6835 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.   
  
**P.S.:**  
As I’m about posting this analysis, a Short GBPUSD trade set-up seems to be forming on the Hourly chart with initial Stop Loss @ 1.6719; and Primary Profit Target @ 1.6580. If you’re able to identify a strong confluence of resistance, don’t hesitate to take the trade.  
However, please remember to keep your risk per trade low: We MUST NEVER assume we KNOW where price is going next!  
Also, always keep in mind any major news releases. Be wary of possible price volatility during these periods.

Hi guys, I think this is a good read on money-management. It’s somewhat a funny article, but its truth is intact: [http://www.thegeekknows.com/2009/08/...-call-tom.html](http://www.thegeekknows.com/2009/08/story-of-margin-call-tom.html)

Pls NOTE: On the Weekly chart (please refer to yesterday’s analysis), the reversal candle that formed around a strong resistance level is still doing a good job of sustaining our bias for a downward price move.   
  
**On the Daily chart**(attached), continuing from where we stopped our analysis yesterday, as envisaged, price travelled down to the demand or upward trend line, which is currently doing a nice job of holding the bears. Although, price seems set to continue its bearish move, the previous day low @ 1.6430 (which we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line) is a support level we would like to see price break downward for a stronger SELL signal. The Waving negative MACD Divergence (that we’ve identified using the red dashed lines on the upper and lower windows of the trading platform), which we also discussed yesterday, is still intact. MACD has crossed below its Signal Line. It becomes a valid -ve MACD Div. if it closes below its Signal Line by the end of today. If that happens – with the current situation on the weekly chart – we should be fully prepared for a possible sustained downtrend that might last for days, weeks, or longer.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), yesterday, price broke, _at that time,_ the most recent swing low @ 1.6649 (which we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line) downward. That automatically shifted our bias in favor of a downward price move. To strengthen the argument for a continuing downward move, the H4 chart gives us a clearer view of price action around the demand trend line that we discussed on the Daily chart: as seen on the H4 chart, the demand trend line seems to have turned to a resistance level preventing price reversal upward.   
However, as we also noted on the Daily chart, the previous day low – that is also seen on the H4 chart as the most recent swing low @ 1.6430 (which we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line) is a support level we would like to see price break downward for a stronger SELL signal. The white horizontal line @ 1.6717 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

Based on previous days’ analyses, The GBPUSD presented a Short trade opportunity earlier today. I entered a Short position. While the trade is currently on, I’ll like to give an update on the higher time frames analyses, and also explain the few steps I’ve taken so far in managing the Short trade:  
  
**On the Daily chart**(attached), price, eventually, broke the support level @ 1.6430 (which we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line) downward. Also, we now have a valid negative MACD Divergence (which we’ve identified using the red dashed lines on the upper and lower windows of the trading platform) as MACD closed below its Signal Line yesterday. With these actions, we should expect a possible sustained downtrend that might last for days, weeks, or longer – suitable for longer term traders.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price recently broke the most recent swing low @ 1.6430 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line). This break helped to sustain our bias for a downward price movement. The white horizontal line @ 1.6514 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.  
  
**On the Hourly chart**(attached), price formed a tradable pattern of lower highs and lower lows with the most recent Hourly swing high @ 1.6499. Price temporarily bottomed @ 1.6389.  
However, I observed a waving +ve MACD Div. (NOTE: not yet valid) that signaled the possibility of an imminent upward price movement. The signal was a warning to manage the trade conservatively.   
  
**On the M5 chart**(attached), we have a clearer view of the Hourly price action. With strong confluences of resistance levels around the fib. 61.8% ret. level @ 1.6457, and the fib. 78.6% ret. level @ 1.6475. I decided to place a Limit Order between both levels (so as to enjoy a better reward:risk while taking precaution against being too far away from the first potential reversal level).   
Price happened to reach the "in-between" level exactly, and reversed favorably (it doesn’t always happen that way). As price triggered the Limit Order and reversed almost instantly, and bearing in mind the Hourly waving +ve MACD Divergence and the BOE Inflation Report about to be released, it was a great opportunity to quickly turn the trade to a NO-LOSS trade: As price moved further downward by over 10 pips, with a bearish reversal candle about to form on the 15min chart (Pls NOTE it’s better to wait till it’s formed), I exited half of my position, and subsequently moved my Stop Loss a couple of pips above the reversal candle, which was less than 10 pips away from my Entry Level.  
  
Currently, as I'm writing this note, I’ve been stopped out with a few pips in profit. I took a very conservative trade.  
  
You could’ve have managed this trade in a completely different way. You could have made more profit, lost, or even still be in the trade as price is yet to move anywhere close to the most recent Hourly swing high which was the initial Stop Loss level.

There is a setup that I'm watching on Aussie today. There is a confluence of overlapping fibs + W-M1 and broken support around .8280 area. If price manages to move up and get there my stop will be above .8310 area.

I have been following this thread from the beginning. I must commend your efforts for taking time to analyse and give useful hints about the market. It is a difficult thing to do, especially the way you combine it with your own trades. However, I would like to know why you prefer entries from the H1 Time Frame, because sometimes the H4 actually provides similar or better entries. For example, I followed the GBUSD through the H4 and I was also able to get some reasonable pips. Again keep doing this wonderful job.

Just an update to my earlier post. I ended up not taking this trade which ended up being a wise decision. I was long on Euro based on another system and it didn't make sense to short Aussie based on just overlapping Fibs.

I guess that isn’t a bad decision. Intuition and experience are also necessary in trading.

Trendylines, e se gan.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) You have a point, but as you probably know, taking trades based on H4 setups can’t really be considered as day trading. It usually takes longer period to manage and exit such trades – if you would agree with me.  
Apart, from the day-trade factor, which absolutely works with individual personalities and time-availability, I personally don’t see any other reasons why one shouldn’t consider H4 setups. And, if not for the sake of simplicity and consistency, we would definitely be discussing it on the thread.

**On the Daily chart**(attached), we could notice a reversal candle pattern (engulfing candle) around the lower border of a rising wedge chart formation. Also, price has broken above the previous day high @ 1.4246 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line). These are good signs supporting the possibility of a continuous price movement upward. The upper edge of the rising wedge is about 200 pips above the current price level; hence, another complementary sign that price has a good chance of moving further upward.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing high @ 1.4246 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) upward. This automatically shifts our bias in favor of an upward price move. The green horizontal line @ 1.4121 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it – in the absence of any new and higher swing low – our bullish or upward bias remains intact.

Based on our earlier analysis today, the EURUSD presented a Long trade opportunity about a couple of hours ago. I’m currently not in the trade as I was targeting the fib. 78.6% ret. @ 1.4260. If you set your Limit Order around fib 61.8% ret. @ 1.4274, you would, at the moment, be in the profit.  
Please manage your trade properly.

**On the Daily chart**(attached), the reversal candle pattern (engulfing candle), observed yesterday around the lower border of a rising wedge chart formation, is still doing a good job of holding our bias in favor of an upward price move. However, price is currently below the previous day high @ 1.4326 (that we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line), which, if we look closely toward the left side of the chart, happens to be around a previous swing high – not an observation we should ignore. These conflicting signs are only warning us to be very careful until the coast is clear.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price broke a recent (not the most recent) swing high @ 1.4246 (which we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line) a while ago. However, a new swing high – coincidentally the previous day high @ 1.4326 (which we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line) has formed, and price is yet to break above it. While price break above the 1.4246 level strengthens our bias in favor of a continuous upward price move, the new swing high (and previous day high) @ 1.4326 is a major resistance level that we would like to see price break upward. The green horizontal line @ 1.4121 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it – in the absence of any new and higher swing low – our bullish or upward bias remains intact.  
In all, we are cautiously in favor of an upward price movement today  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels – to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows. Please note that our aim is to buy a dip in today’s up-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

Pls NOTE: On the Weekly chart (please refer to Monday, Aug. 10 analysis), the reversal candle that formed around a strong resistance level the penultimate week is still doing a very good job of sustaining our bias for a downward price move.   
****  
**On the Daily chart**(attached), continuing from where we stopped our analyses early last week; after price broke below the upward trend-line, and MACD crossed below its Signal Line to validate the –ve MACD divergence (that we’ve identified using the red dashed lines on the upper and lower windows of the trading platform), price seems ready to continue its journey southward – as envisaged. The current major price actions confirming the continuation of this downward bias are: First, we would notice price retracement upward was halted around the upward trend-line, which now acts as a resistance area. Second, price has broken the most recent Daily swing low @ 1.6389 (which we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line) downward. These signs are simply too strong to ignore: we now have a strong bias to seek Short trade set-ups on the Hourly chart – with the H4 chart support. Except we really know what we’re doing, from a day-trade perspective, it’s very risky to be taking a counter trend trade in an environment as this.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing low @ 1.6483 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) downward. That automatically signaled the resumption of our bias in favor of a major downward price move. The white horizontal line @ 1.6607 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

Earlier today, we concluded today’s bias is to go Short.  
  
**The Hourly chart**(attached) is currently forming a tradable pattern. Price seems to have bottomed temporarily @ 1.6274. Hence, we expect price to retrace to the area between 1.6409 and 1.6545 (which is the area between the 50% and 100% fib. retracement levels – drawn from the most recent Hourly swing high to the current price-bottom). Let’s seek to sell around this area. If price exceeds the 1.6545 level upward, our bearish bias is no more valid and we enter a no-trading zone. Our primary profit target is @ 1.6201 (the 127% fib. ext.).  
  
Also, if price breaks below 1.6274 (current price-bottom) before retracing to the sell-area, we’ll have to redraw our Fibonacci tools using a new bottom & the most recent Hourly swing high to determine new potential areas to sell.  
  
**The 15min. chart**(attached) gives us a clearer view of the Hourly price action and the potential areas to sell (please note it’s advisable to set a Limit order ahead of time as price could move up to these levels and reverse sharply in our favor).  
This chart is rather cluttered but if we look closely, there are a number of potential reversal levels available. You choose your preferred level based on your personality.  
  
fib 50% ret. @ 1.6409;  
fib 61.8% ret. @ 1.6441;   
fib 78.6% ret. @ 1.6486.   
  
Initial Stop Loss @ 1.6547; primary Profit target @ 1.6201 (Please remember to factor in your broker’s pip-spread).  
  
Please note that all these Fibonacci (fib.) levels have other pivots, overlapping fibs or previous highs/lows supporting them (they are the cause of this cluttered chart). As such, price could reverse at any of the points. The issue here is that the higher the fib level you choose to sell from, the smaller the pips you’ll risk and the more your pip-profit; BUT, also the more the likelihood of you missing the trade as price might not retrace that high before moving back downward.  
You need your own discretion here.  
  
Please keep your risk low. Don’t risk more than 2% of your capital. Personally, I risk about 0.5% per trade; and each trade has a potential profit target of 1% or more – based on my exit levels.  
We MUST NEVER assume we KNOW where price is going next!  
  
P.S.:   
Similar Short trade and Long trade set-ups are forming on the EURUSD and USDCHF pairs respectively.  
Also, always keep in mind any major news releases. Be wary of possible price volatility during these periods.

Hi Biz, actually, if your entries are based on certain defined parameters, you would always miss quite a number of trades; but you won’t see the missing trades as lost opportunities, since, within the context of your edge, they were not opportunities in the first place.  
I’m sure your trading parameters identified an entry opportunity when you took your small position; however, mine didn’t. I wish us all a profitable week.

Quite right Tunji, In order to keep the thread focused on its original system, i stopped posting my trades since the criteria i use is a bit different from yours. Perhaps others too should keep their postings here in line with the stated criteria so we wont get others (especially newbies) confused.  
  
Wish you all a pipful week.

**On the Daily chart**(attached), as we observed yesterday, a couple of more recent price actions – in addition to previous ones that we’ve been discussing for over a week – are sustaining our bias in favor a continuing downward price movement: price retracement upward that was halted around the upward trend-line, which acted as a resistance area; and price-break below a former support level – the most recent Daily swing low @ 1.6389 (which we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line). Note that this previous support @ 1.6389 is currently acting as a resistance level. These signs are still good enough to sustain our bias for a downward price move – from a day-trade perspective.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), yesterday, price broke the most recent swing low @ 1.6483 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) downward. That price action shifted – and has sustained – our bias in favor of a downward price move. The white horizontal line @ 1.6607 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

Thanks a lot for your support D liberators. I really believe consistency matters. With that, we know exactly the number of strategies we have in our individual trading toolkits, and probably trade them on separate accounts to keep accurate tab on each method’s performance.

**On the Daily chart**(attached), we would observe the USDJPY pair has been in a steep downtrend for more than a week. Recent Daily swing low has been broken southward. However, the current price formation isn’t too clear – from my perspective: price seems to be in a tight downward channel, and with yesterday’s candle formation giving us a weak sign that the bears are still somewhat in charge, our bias is still in favor of a continuous downward price movement. To buttress our bearish bias, price has broken the previous day low @ 94.19 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) downward. Let’s expect price to move further downward toward the lower edge of the downward channel. The only “but” today is simply based on the not-too-clear current price formation.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price broke the most recent swing low – also the previous day low @ 94.19 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) downward. That automatically sustained our bias in favor of a downward price move. The white horizontal line @ 95.28 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.  
  
**P.S.:**  
As I’m about posting this analysis, a Short USDJPY trade set-up seems to be forming on the Hourly chart with initial Stop Loss @ 94.71; and Primary Profit Target @ 93.96. If you’re able to identify a strong confluence of resistance, please consider taking the trade.  
However, please remember to keep your risk per trade low: We MUST NEVER assume we KNOW where price is going next!  
Also, always keep in mind any major news releases. Be wary of possible price volatility during these periods.

**_Pls NOTE:_**_Based on earlier analysis of the USDJPY pair today, a couple of Short trade set-ups occurred. If you used the fib 50% ret. levels both times, you would have closed the first in profit, and the second would comfortably be in your favor by now: The first set-up had its 50% level @ 94.40 with primary profit target @ 93.95; the second set-up (with the fib drawn from the same Hourly swing high, but with different price-bottoms) had its 50% level @ 94.21 with primary profit target @ 93.47. As you’re probably aware, personally, I go for 61.8% ret. – and preferably, 78.6% ret. because of my love for high reward:risk trade. So, I missed both trades._  
  
If you were able to identify the USDCHF Short trade set-up and took the trade, that’s great.  
  
**On** **the Hourly chart** (attached), we could notice the sharp upward retracement from where price initially bottomed @ 1.0721 to the exact level of fib. 61.8% ret. @ 1.0757. If your Limit Order wasn’t placed around the fib. 50% ret. level @ 1.0750, or a few pips below 61.8% level, you would have missed the trade. I missed it by a whisker. It could be very frustrating – especially when I also consider the missed USDJPY trades.  
As we could see, as price sharply retraced upward, with almost the same momentum, it reversed downward all the way to hit the primary profit target @ 1.0706 (the fib. 127% ext.); then continued its “mad” rush further downward to hit the secondary target @ 1.0686 (the fib. 161.8% ext.).   
  
**The 15min chart**(attached),gives us a much clearer view of the Hourly price action.  
  
P.S.:  
This trade was fully supported by the H4 chart price action.

In light of what is currently happening with the majors, we would know that virtually any “buy-dollar” trade set-up, from a day-trade perspective, is doomed.  
  
I took a Short GBPUSD trade, but was fortunate to manage the trade well enough to close at break-even (2pip profit). Maybe explaining what I did might offer a few insights.  
  
**On the Hourly chart** above, I identified a nice confluence of resistance levels around fib. 61.8% ret. @ 1.6489. I also noticed a very distinct most recent Hourly swing low @ 1.6509, which was closer to the fib. 78.6% @ 1.6520 (I apologize for not highlighting it with a horizontal line). I decided to place my Limit Order around the most recent Hourly swing low @ 1.6509 – mainly to enjoy a high reward:risk while trying as much as possible not to miss out of any potential beautiful trade.  
  
**On the 15min chart** above, as you would observe, price moved upward and met resistance almost at the same level of the most recent Hourly swing low @ 1.6509. Automatically, my Limit Order was filled. As priced instantly reversed downward, I saw an opportunity to quickly turn the trade to a no-loss trade.   
  
In the absence of a well formed reversal candle formation on the 15min chart, I waited for the close of the second bearish 15min candle, and concluded that if there would be any major downward price move, the two 15min bearish candles (that formed around major resistance levels) were strong enough to initiate the downward move. Hence, with a two-lot position, I closed half of my position @ 22pip profit; then moved my Stop Loss to 20 pips above my entry level, which was 15pips above the 15min candles (that included my broker’s spread). That automatically made the trade a no-loss trade with a “windfall” profit potential of 186pips.   
  
Alas, today wasn’t my lucky day.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1)

**On the Daily chart**(attached), as a result of the drastic loss dollar experienced on all the major pairs yesterday, on the USDCHF Daily chart, we would observe that price has broken the most recent Daily swing low @ 1.0668 (which we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line) downward. Also we would notice than price is currently in a lower high, lower low formation. These are good signs supporting a bias for downward price movement. However, there is a very major support area around the 1.0600 level, this support area has remained a critical level since May 2008 (please refer to your Weekly and Monthly charts); hence, we should be very careful as the bears might be contending with some fierce bulls around this level.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price broke the most recent swing low @ 1.0725 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) downward. This automatically shifts our bias in favor of a downward price move. The white horizontal line @ 1.0779 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact. Please, as you seek opportunities to go Short, bear in mind the critical support area around the 1.0600 level. As a conservative trader, you may want to wait for a clean break.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

If you were able to identify the USDJPY Short trade set-up and took the trade, that’s great. I took it, and, currently, I’m still in it. I’ll give analysis of today’s bias based on higher time frame charts, and then explain the steps I’ve taken so far in managing the Short trade.

**On the Daily chart**(attached), similar to what we observed on Wednesday, the USDJPY pair has been in a steep downtrend for more than a week. Previous days’ lows have been broken southward. Also, if we take a closer look at the Daily chart – precisely the previous two days’ candles – we would observe that the whole of yesterday’s price action occurred within Wednesday’s candle (price range), which resulted in an “inside-candle” formation. Price-break below the inside-candle earlier today signified the possibility of further movement of price downward. In addition, studying the narrow downward channel, price seems to have room to move further downward – toward the lower edge of the channel. These price actions are good signs supporting a bias for downward price movement.   
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price broke the most recent swing low – also the previous day low @ 93.84 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) downward. That automatically sustained our bias in favor of a downward price move. The white horizontal line @ 94.54 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.   
Pls NOTE: The H4 chart also gives us a clearer view of price action within the downward channel discussed on the Daily chart.  
****  
**On** **the Hourly chart** (attached), price pattern was forming lower highs and lower lows; hence, I drew the Fibonacci tool using the most recent Hourly swing high @ 94.28, and the temporary price-bottom @ 93.46, and then identified an area around the fib. 61.8% ret. level as a potential price reversal area to place my Limit Order (Pls NOTE the 61.8% ret. level was supported by pivots, other fibs., and previous lows).   
Initial Stop Loss was placed 2pips above the most recent Hourly swing high @ 94.33 (broker’s spread included). Primary profit target @ 93.24 (two pips above the fib. 127% ext.).   
  
**On The 15min chart**(attached),after the Limit Order was triggered @ 94.01 (exactly on a Daily pivot level), price reversed downward almost immediately. Hence, I had a good opportunity to quickly turn the trade to a no-loss trade. With a 3-lot position, I took profit on one lot @ 19-pip profit, then, adjusted the Stop Loss for the remaining position to 9 pips above my Entry level, which was 5 pips above the most recent 15min swing high. That automatically made the trade a no-loss trade with a profit potential of 75 pips.

After I exited the first lot @ 19-pip profit, price moved further downward. With that, I took the next step to identify an appropriate level where I could take profit on the second lot, as price has the tendency to turn upward as it moves further downward toward the price-bottom @ 93.46. Besides, there was already a waving +ve MACD Divergence on the Hourly chart: a possibility of a major price move upward (a major move from a day-trade perspective) that might trigger the Stop Loss.  
  
Consequently, **on the 15min chart** (attached), I drew a new Fibonacci tool in the opposite direction to determine a support level that might prevent further movement downward. I identified the fib. 61.8% ret. level @ 93.69, which was supported by Daily and Weekly pivots. Afterward, I waited to observe price reaction around the level. With a “doji” candle and a bullish candle, I concluded it was ok to exit my second lot @ 24-pip profit. With two lots taken, the trade automatically turned to a profitable trade – regardless of price movement.  
My exit for the last lot is @ 93.24 (the primary profit target @ fib. 127% ext. level). Further Stop Loss adjustments would be based on new Hourly swing highs.  
  
P.S.:  
I lost a GBPUSD Short trade. Fortunately, I had the opportunity to cut my loss; however, with better trade-management, it would’ve been a no loss trade.

**On the Daily chart**(attached), we could see that price couldn’t sustain its steep downward move as it advanced toward the lower edge of the narrow channel; hence it reversed sharply to break above the upper edge of the channel – breaking above previous day’s highs in the process. Also, if we take a closer look at the Daily chart – precisely the previous two trading days’ candles (last week Thursday and Friday) – we would observe that the whole of Thursday’s price action occurred within Friday’s candle (price range), which resulted in an “engulfing-candle” formation. An engulfing candle at the end of a steep downward move such as this gives us a good probability that price is set to reverse its direction. Furthermore, Price-break above the engulfing-candle earlier today buttressed the possibility of further movement of price downward.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price broke the most recent swing high @ 94.54 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) upward. That automatically shifted our bias in favor of an upward price move. The green horizontal line @ 93.41 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it – in the absence of any new and higher swing low – our bullish or upward bias remains intact.   
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels – to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows. Please note that our aim is to buy a dip in today’s up-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

If you were able to identify the GBPUSD Short trade set-up and took the trade, that’s great. For unavoidable reasons, I wasn’t in the market at the time of price action. However, I’ll go ahead to give analysis of today’s bias based on higher time frame charts, and then explain the steps I would’ve taken so far in managing the Short trade.  
****  
**On the Daily chart**(attached), for days, price has been struggling around the upward trend-line: lots of indecision regarding whether to reverse upward or continue its movement downward. Currently, price has broken the previous day low downward; hence, we expect continuation of the downward move. However, the most recent Daily swing low @ 1.6274 (which we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line) is a major support level that we have to keep in mind.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price broke the most recent swing low @ 1.6418 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) downward. That automatically sustained our bias in favor of a downward price move. The white horizontal line @ 1.6622 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.   
****  
**On** **the Hourly chart** (attached), price pattern was forming lower highs and lower lows; hence, drawing the Fibonacci tool using the most recent Hourly swing high @ 1.6427, and the temporary price-bottom @ 1.6339, we had potential price reversal areas around fibs. 61.8% ret. (1.6393) and 78.6% ret. (1.6408) levels. (Pls NOTE both retracement levels were supported by pivots, other fibs., and previous lows).   
Initial Stop Loss was placed 2pips above the most recent Hourly swing high @ 1.6432 (broker’s spread included). Primary profit target @ 1.6317 (two pips above the fib. 127% ext.).   
  
**On The 15min chart**(attached),with a clearer view of the Hourly price action, and based on my reward:risk ratio assessment, I would place my Limit Order in-between both fibs. 61.8% and 78.6% ret. levels – precisely @ 1.6400, which is just under a Daily pivot @ 1.6402. After the Limit Order was triggered @ 1.6400, and price reversed downward almost immediately – with the 15min engulfing-candle reversal formation at a confluence of resistance – it was a good opportunity to quickly turn the trade to a no-loss trade. With a 3-lot position, I would take profit on one lot @ 25-pip profit, and then adjust the Stop Loss for the remaining position to 12 pips above my Entry level (5 pips above the most recent 15min swing high @ 1.6407). That automatically would’ve made the trade a no-loss trade with a profit potential of 83 pips.  
The next step would have been to identify an appropriate level where I could take profit on the second lot, as price has the tendency to turn upward as it moves further downward toward the price-bottom @ 1.6339.

**On the Daily chart**(attached), as anticipated, price continued its movement downward. The upward trend-line (that we’ve highlighted using the red broken line), around which price struggled for days, has been decisively broken downward. A more recent upward trend-line (that we’ve highlighted using the red solid line) is the new area price is attempting to break downward. Also, as observed yesterday, the most recent Daily swing low @ 1.6274 (which we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line) is a major support level that we are still waiting for price to break downward to boost our downward bias. In all, current price pattern seems to favor a downward move, but the discussed obstacles to this downward move should not be disregarded.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), we have a clearer view of price action around the more recent upward trend-line that we discussed earlier on the Daily chart: we could see the trend-line is already acting as a resistance area on the H4 chart as price’s attempt to break above it was rejected. The swing low @ 1.6418 (that we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line), which price broke below on Monday, has remained the most recent swing low since last week Friday. That automatically sustains our bias in favor of a downward price move. The white horizontal line @ 1.6443 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.   
****  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

Hi Tunji,  
  
Thank you for sharing your very detailed and accurate analysis with us. Your strategy is clean, clear, simple and refreshing. Even though other threads on FF have Fibonacci strategies, your thorough analysis is exceptionally informative.   
  
I use Fibonacci's in a similar way and it flows in with my daily top down analysis. I identify direction using daily and 4 hour chart, and apply fibs on 1 hour chart in the direction of the overall trend. I then go to the 15 minute chart where fibs are already placed (from 1 hour chart) and look for specific candlestick formations at the fib levels (.786, .618, or .50 prior to entry. The candlestick formations that I refer to are fractals or pin bars. My question relates to your entry. Do you look for a specific formation also or do you just place your limit order at the the fib level.   
  
What is the frequency with which you find great setups across the 4 majors that you trade. Thank you and happy trading.

Fxpilot, you’re very much welcome, and thanks for your kind words. As you said, I could see our approaches are very similar, and that’s great.  
  
I use Limit Orders around a certain fib. level, as long as there are other pivots, previous highs/lows, and overlapping fibs supporting it. Such confluences of support/resistance levels are strong enough for me to believe the fib. level will hold – at least temporarily. I only use candle formations to manage my trade after the Limit Order has been triggered. I must say, as with other methods, it has its pros and cons.  
  
The set-ups frequency, based on my observation, varies depending on the market environment. At times, on a currency pair, you might have at least a set-up per day throughout a whole week; other times, you might have just one set-up throughout the entire week. Also, as you probably know, except you trade “24/5” (round-the-clock) or you run a robot, you’ll definitely be missing some set-ups.  
  
Again, thanks Fxpilot.

**On the Daily chart**(attached), again, as anticipated, price continued its movement downward. The “more recent” upward trend-line, which we observed yesterday as the new area price was attempting to break downward, has been decisively broken. Also, price has broken the most recent Daily swing low @ 1.6274 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) downward. These new signs – in addition to the still-valid negative MACD Divergence and higher time frames’ price actions that we discussed earlier this month – are simply telling us the bears are in control. However, the previous day low @ 1.6158 (not highlighted on this Daily chart to avoid clustering) is another level we might like to keep in mind as a potential support area. Price-break below the 1.6158 level is a good sign that price is ready to continue its downward move.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), the swing low @ 1.6418 (that we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line), which price broke below on Monday, still remains the most recent swing low. That automatically sustains our bias in favor of a downward price move. The previous day low @ 1.6158 (that we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line), which we discussed on the Daily chart, is shown on this H4 chart. Please let’s keep the level in mind. The white horizontal line @ 1.6443 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.   
****  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.

Hi Tunji,  
  
I am waiting for the retrace on GBPUSD to sell in accordance with your analysis. I am also looking at EURUSD as it seems as if it may present a better opportunity. Currently price has retraced to 50% fib level, which is also in line with daily pivot point, a price pivot zone and a second test of the sessions high. Selling at 1.4265. I would appreciate your feedback. Thank you.

Hi Fxpilot, if you’re able to attach your charts in subsequent posts, that’ll be great. It’ll help everyone have a better understanding of your analysis.  
However, I think I have an idea of what you’re saying. Looking at my EURUSD Hourly chart (attached), price has broken the most recent Hourly swing high @ 1.4252 (highlighted using the blue broken line) upward. I determine a swing high by a candle having two lower candles on either side. Since I always use the most recent Hourly swing high/low to draw my fibs., the EURUSD pair is currently in no-trade zone; although the bias – based on the H4 chart – is still bearish.  
  
However, please note there are many ways to analyze price movement, so, for the fact that this method is currently not giving the green light to short the euro doesn’t mean other methods are doing same.

Hi Tunji,  
  
Thank you for your response. I will try to post charts in the future. Your are correct re. no mans land. I had only considered the overall trend which is still bearish. I will refine my analysis in accordance with your suggestion. By respecting the swing points on 1 hour chart also, trade success probability can only increase. Great point.

Now, the coast is clear to seek a GBPUSD Short trade set-up. Price just breached the most recent Hourly swing low @ 1.6158, which is also the previous day low (GBPUSD Hourly chart attached). The retracement might happen, and it might not. Besides, the resistance confluence must be in place (pivots, previous high/low, overlapping fibs.). Personally, because of my trading hours, if a suitable retracement doesn’t happen early, I might not be in the market to take the trade; lots of nuances to deal with.  
The EURUSD is also coming up: most recent swing low already broken downward, but there’s yet to be an opportunity to draw overlapping fibs.

The GBPUSD Short trade didn’t work out, but with proper money management, there’s always opportunity to be in another trade.  
It’s also good to know that we were protected from taking a EURUSD Short trade.

**On the Daily chart**(attached), yesterday, the Swissy (as well as the Euro and Cable) rallied against the Dollar. As a result, some charts’ formations were altered. Studying the USDCHF Daily chart, we would observe that price dashed downward to break a critical support level – the most recent Daily low @ 1.0551 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) downward. Price-break below this level gives a good sign that the bears might currently be in control. However, as discussed on last week Thursday, the 1.0600 level is a major support area that has remained very critical since May 2008 (please refer to your Weekly and Monthly charts); hence, we should be very careful as the bears might be contending with some fierce bulls around this level. Although, price is currently below 1.0600, personally, I believe price has to close decisively below the entire 1.0600 area to ascertain the strength of the Swissy. In all, the Daily chart – from a day trade perspective – currently leans toward downward price movement.   
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing low @ 1.0579 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) downward. This automatically shifts our bias in favor of a downward price move. The bulls’ strength – as discussed on the Daily chart – could also be observed on the H4 chart as price sharply pierced below the most recent swing low, but was forced to close above it. However, based on this method’s parameters, once a most recent H4 swing low is broken, our bias shifts in favor of the bears. The white horizontal line @ 1.0702 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.  
****  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

If you were able to identify the GBPUSD Long trade set-up and took the trade, that’s great. I took it, and, currently, I’m still in it. It was slightly nerve-racking as price surged downward toward the initial Stop Loss before it reversed just 5 pips to the Stop. I’ll explain the steps I’ve taken so far in managing the trade.   
  
**_Please NOTE_** _that the Daily chart (attached) isn’t really supporting a Long trade as price is currently forming lower highs and lows; though, a retracement is occurring, price is testing the upward trend-line – a potential resistance area. More conservative traders would have refrained from this trade. Personally, what I did was to reduce my risk. The H4 chart, however, supports a Long trade._  
  
**On** **the Hourly chart** (attached), price pattern was forming higher highs and higher lows; hence, I drew the Fibonacci tool using the most recent Hourly swing low @ 1.6261, and the temporary price-top @ 1.6380, and then identified an area around the fib. 78.6% ret. level as a potential price reversal area to place my Limit Order (Pls NOTE the 78.6% ret. level was supported by pivots, other fibs., and previous highs).   
Initial Stop Loss was placed 2pips below the most recent Hourly swing low @ 1.6259 (broker’s spread included). Primary profit target @ 1.6411 (two pips below the fib. 127% ext.).   
  
**On The 15min chart**(attached), after the Limit Order was triggered @ 1.6294, price continued downward – almost stopping me out, but then reversed sharply. Afterward, as price moved almost 30 pips in my favor, and struggling to stay above a Weekly pivot @ 1.6312, keeping the dissenting Daily chart in mind, I decided to move my Stop Loss to break-even.   
As price moved further upward, I exited one out of two lots @ 31-pip profit (precisely 1.6325). With that, the trade is already profitable. The profit target for the second lot is 1.6411 (117pip profit). Further Stop Loss adjustments would be based on new Hourly swing lows.

**On the Daily chart**(attached), we could see that the USDJPY pair has been in downward channel formation since the second week of this month, and currently, traders still seem comfortable with the formation. After several days of hugging the upper edge of the channel, price is probably ready to now test its lower edge. There seems to be enough room for price to continue its southward journey before encountering a potential major support – the Weekly chart most recent swing low @ 91.70 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line). The strength of the 91.70 level is buttressed by the channel formation as we would observe that the lower edge of the channel – a potential reversal area in itself – might coincide with the 91.70 support to form a support confluence if price eventually travelled down that far. In all, the current price behavior is good enough to sustain our bias for a downward price move – from a day trade perspective.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), yesterday, price broke the most recent swing low @ 93.20 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) downward. That sustains our bias in favor of a downward price move. The white horizontal line @ 94.06 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.

**On the Daily chart**(attached), as we observed almost throughout the latter part of last month, price is still hovering within the region of the 1.0600 level – a very major support level. Price has broken the previous day low @ 1.0553 (which we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line) downward. This shows that the bears are a somewhat ready to push price further downward – at least from a day-trade perspective. However, except for very aggressive traders, the coast is still very unclear as the entire area where price has been dwelling for days, as earlier said, is a very strong support area. Moderately aggressive traders that are prepared to go ahead and place trades might consider reducing their risk.   
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing low, which also happens to be the previous day low @ 1.0553 (that we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line), downward. That price action automatically shifted our bias in favor of a downward price move. Again, please be very conscious of the fact that price is within a major support area; hence downward pressure might be limited. The white horizontal line @ 1.0634 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.

**On the Daily chart**(attached), since the beginning of last month (August), we’ve been discussing the possibility of the GBPUSD pair experiencing a protracted downward move. Price action throughout the month of August only strengthened our bias. Currently, there’re quite a number of factors working in favor of a sustained price move downward – both fundamental and technical; but our primary focus is on technical factors: We would observe on the Daily chart that price is in a lower-high-lower-low formation; a previous upward trend-line (the red dashed line) that price broke below about a week ago has been acting as a strong resistance area as price retracement upward was halted twice in that area. A more recent upward trend-line (the red solid line – NOT the bold line) is a new area price seems set to break downward; although we won’t be able to ascertain that until price closes, decisively, below it. However, price has broken the previous month low – the most recent Daily swing low @ 1.6152 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) downward. That’s another very strong indication that the bears are resolved to hold on to their reign. And, last but not least is the previous day low that price has also breached. In all, we have preponderance of factors supporting a continuous downward price movement.   
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing low @ 1.6182 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) downward. That automatically sustains our bias in favor of a downward price move. The white horizontal line @ 1.6374 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.   
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

Hi Tunji,  
  
Once again, great analysis and charts. I am in full agreement and remain bearish as market flow on daily and 4 hour charts are down. Price has now retraced to .50 fib level, which is also a psychological level 1.6250 and through the daily pivot point. In my opinion, price is now in an area where we have a triple confluence of events. I am waiting for further confirmation to sell. Could you clarify for me your final criteria on 1 hour chart when you said price should be making lower highs and lower lows...is that per candle or swing points. Also, at what point would you enter.   
  
Thank you.

Thanks for your kind words Fxpilot. Price making lower-highs and lower-lows, I believe, is the same as saying the market flow is down. A lower high is a lower swing high, and a lower low is a lower swing low. Hope the explanation is clear enough?  
  
Regarding the method discussed on this thread (which employs Hourly overlapping Fibonaccis, and Hourly lower-highs, lower-lows for Short trades), a Short trade is currently not valid. Using the attached Hourly chart, price has broken the most recent Hourly swing high @ 1.6191 (highlighted with the blue broken line) upward. Besides, price didn’t form a lower-low as it couldn’t break below the _then_ most recent Hourly swing low @ 1.6113 (highlighted with the green dashed line) downward, before it retraced upward.  
  
However, I’ve realized the Daily and H4 charts analyses work with many day-trading methods – as well as some swing-trading methods. But, as I’ve often said, the method discussed on this thread has been limited to just one for the sake of simplicity. In short, based on H4 Fibonacci, pivots, and previous swing highs/lows, a Short trade set-up is currently valid.

There’s currently a Short trade set-up on the USDJPY Hourly chart. I’ll give a top-down analysis – starting with the Daily chart:  
  
**On the Daily chart**(attached), as discussed earlier this week, we could see that the USDJPY pair has been in downward channel formation since the second week of last month (August). Price has been travelling gradually toward the lower edge of the channel, and there seems to be enough room for price to continue its move southward: a major support – the Weekly chart most recent swing low @ 91.70 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) is still some pips away. Also, price has broken below the previous day low. The current price behavior is good enough to sustain our bias for a downward price move – from a day trade perspective.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing low @ 92.53 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) downward. That sustains our bias in favor of a downward price move. The white horizontal line @ 93.04 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.  
  
**The Hourly chart**(attached) is currently forming a tradable pattern. Price bottomed @ 91.93 and it has started its retracement upward. We expect price to retrace to the area between 92.49 and 93.03 (which is the area between the 50% and 100% fib. retracement levels – drawn from the most recent Hourly swing high to the current price-bottom). **_NOTE_** _that price has reached the 50% fib. ret. already_. Let’s seek to sell around this area. If price exceeds the 93.03 level upward, our bearish bias is no more valid and we enter a no-trading zone. Our primary profit target is @ 91.63 (the 127% fib. ext.).  
  
**The 15min. chart**(attached) gives us a clearer view of the Hourly price action and the potential areas to sell (please note it’s advisable to set a Limit order ahead of time as price could move up to these levels and reverse sharply in our favor).  
This chart is rather cluttered but if we look closely, there are a couple of potential reversal levels available. You choose your preferred level based on your personality.  
  
fib 50% ret. @ 92.49 (you would be in the trade already if you chose this level – please manage your trade properly);   
fib 78.6% ret. @ 92.80.   
  
Initial Stop Loss @ 93.07; primary Profit target @ 91.63 (Please remember to factor in your broker’s pip-spread).  
  
Please note that these Fibonacci (fib.) levels have other pivots, overlapping fibs or previous highs/lows supporting them (they are the cause of this cluttered chart). As such, price could reverse at any of the points. The issue here is that the higher the fib level you choose to sell from, the smaller the pips you’ll risk and the more your pip-profit; BUT, also the more the likelihood of you missing the trade as price might not retrace that high before moving back downward.  
You need your own discretion here.  
  
Please keep your risk low. Don’t risk more than 2% of your capital. Personally, I risk about 0.5% per trade; and each trade has a potential profit target of 1% or more – based on my exit levels.  
We MUST NEVER assume we KNOW where price is going next!  
  
P.S.:   
Also, always keep in mind any major news releases. Be wary of possible price volatility during these periods.

Pls NOTE that a new swing high @ 92.56 (highlighted with the white dashed line) has formed on the Hourly chart (attached). With the new swing high, price move above the 92.56 level invalidates any Short trade set-up – based on the method discussed on this thread.  
Consequently, if you took a Short trade based on the 50% fib. ret. (92.49), please manage your trade properly. Your position is still very much promising as price has the potential of moving further downward to hit your profit target.   
However, if you were targeting the 78.6% (92.80), that level is no more valid for a Short trade entry – again, this invalidation is based on the method discussed on this thread.  
  
Also, be very much aware that major news are being released in the US and Europe around this period.

****  
**Pls NOTE:** Based on personal experience,if there’s one particular day in every month that day-traders employing trending patterns should be wary of trading most, it has to be the first Fridays of every month when the Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) report is usually released. Early market hours are usually dull; afterward, usually around the news release, we have extreme volatility, which disrupts any recognizable chart patterns; hence, the entire trading day becomes virtually un-tradable.   
Price action on the GBPUSD pair is buttressing the fact that today isn’t the best of days to contemplate trading:  
****  
**On the Daily chart**(attached), price action is somewhat confusing – probably reflecting the current collective attitude of traders. On Wednesday, despite the overwhelming number of factors supporting the bears’ dominance, the “loner” upward trend-line (the upward trending red solid line – NOT the bold line) proved its strength as price wasn’t only unable to close below it, but price was forced to reverse upward. Currently, price is in a rather confused state: a previous upward trend-line (the red dashed line) that price broke below about a week ago, which has been acting as a strong resistance area, again, halted price reversal upward yesterday; a downward trend-line (the downward trending red solid line) is also a level price has to close decisively above if we’re going to expect further price movement upward.  
As we could see, studying today’s price action on the Daily chart is rather perplexing; and it gives more credence to the fact that traders are probably waiting for the NFP report to act decisively.

please i like to find out from you how u use your fib levels.

Austineejo, thanks a lot for your kind words. Primarily, I use Hourly swings; but as you probably know, the Hourly swings sometimes coincide with previous daily highs/lows and other past events, which automatically give more credence to their strength.

Today, we have Bank Holiday in the US. Consequently, quite a number of traders won't be in the market, and there might be thin volume. I was unable to have analysis posted during the London session; however, current price action on the GBPUSD pair seems to be giving us new signs. This analysis might be useful for those of us trading the late New York session:  
  
**On the Daily chart** (attached), price is currently at a resistance area: a previous upward trend-line (the red dashed line), which we've been discussing for some days now. Though, we are yet to know if price would break above it, or if price would be forced to retreat downward, let's have it in mind that the bulls might be having a tough time around this area.  
  
**On the H4 chart** (attached), price has broken the most recent swing low @ 1.6364 (which we've highlighted using the blue broken line) downward. That shifts our bias in favor of a downward price move. The white horizontal line @ 1.6443 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it - in the absence of any new and lower swing high - our bearish or downward bias remains intact.  
  
**On the Hourly chart** (attached), we have the price action buttressing our bearish bias: price has broken the most recent swing low @ 1.6364 (that we've highlighted using the blue broken line), which also happens to be H4 most recent swing low. Also, we have a negative MACD divergence. Please keep this current price action in mind as you place your trades.   
  
Have a happy Labor Day.

Since the beginning of August, higher time frame charts have been signaling the possibility of bears dominating the GBPUSD for a relatively protracted period. However, while the Monthly and Weekly charts are still giving bearish signals, the **Daily chart** (attached) seems to be having a change of mind: The negative MACD Divergence has been weakened and MACD is about crossing its Signal Line upward. MACD's close above its Signal Line at the end of today will invalidate the negative Divergence. Also, we would notice that after price broke decisively above a downward trend-line (the down trending red line), it seems determined to close above the resistance area - a previous upward trend-line (the red dashed line), which we've been discussing for days. The next critical resistance level that might halt the bullish surge is a Daily swing high @ 1.6623 (which we've highlighted using the blue broken line).  
  
**On the H4 chart** (attached), price has broken the most recent swing high @ 1.6442 (which we've highlighted using the blue broken line) upward. That shifts our bias in favor of an upward price move. The green horizontal line @ 1.6321 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it - in the absence of any new and higher swing low - our bullish or upward bias remains intact.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts - using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels - to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows. Please note that our aim is to buy a dip in today's up-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), the coast seems so clear for the bulls: price has broken the year high - a very major resistance level @ 1.4447 (which we've highlighted using the blue broken line) upward. Pls NOTE that price didn't just break this level, it closed comfortably above it. Also the downward trend-line was broken upward without much effort. These two signs, especially the broken year high, simply tell us there's a high probability that the bulls might be reigning for a considerable period of time. Really, the price action is so clear that there isn't much to analyze.  
  
**On the H4 chart** (attached), price has broken a recent swing high @ 1.4359 (which we've highlighted using the blue broken line) upward. That shifts our bias in favor of an upward price move. The green horizontal line @ 1.4190 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it - in the absence of any new and higher swing low - our bullish or upward bias remains intact.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts - using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels - to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows. Please note that our aim is to buy a dip in today's up-trend.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), we would notice that price has decisively broken below the 1.0600 level, which we've been discussing for a few weeks. Consequently, there is the high probability of price moving further downward. The dollar has been under intense pressure as investors bet on economic recovery through higher yielding currencies. This fundamental perspective only strengthens the validity of the price action seen on our charts. Although - based on the Weekly and Monthly charts - we still have a number of critical support levels that the bears will have to face, the coast is currently clear for a continuous downward price movement.  
  
**On the H4 chart** (attached), price has broken the most recent swing low @ 1.0430 (which we've highlighted using the blue broken line) downward. That sustains our bias in favor of a downward price move. The white horizontal line @ 1.0487 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it - in the absence of any new and lower swing high - our bearish or downward bias remains intact.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts - using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels - to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today's down-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

Good call. I don't find overlapping Fibs but there could be a Gartley setup around 78.6 level and daily R1 @1.0466 area. The swing low came close to be breached but the price stopped 3 pips short making it a valid Gartley.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), while the Monthly and Weekly charts are still giving bearish signals, the Daily chart has signaled move in the opposite direction. The negative MACD Divergence, which was a primary factor that sustained our bearish bias for weeks, has been invalidated: as seen on the lower pane of the chart, MACD has crossed its Signal Line upward. Also, yesterday, price closed above a strong resistance level - a Daily swing high @ 1.6623 (which we've highlighted using the lower blue broken line). The next critical resistance level - the year high @ 1.7042 (which we've highlighted using the upper blue broken line) is a defining level that, if broken upward, would invalidate every indicator supporting a protracted bearish move that we discussed throughout the entire month of August. In all, from a day-trade perspective, we have a strong case in favor of a continuous upward price movement.  
  
**On the H4 chart** (attached), price has broken the most recent swing high @ 1.6591 (which we've highlighted using the blue broken line) upward. That sustains our bias in favor of an upward price move. The green horizontal line @ 1.6479 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it - in the absence of any new and higher swing low - our bullish or upward bias remains intact.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts - using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels - to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows. Please note that our aim is to buy a dip in today's up-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

**On the Daily chart**(attached), we would notice that price is in a strong down trend: price pattern keeps forming lower highs and lower lows. In addition, price has broken a very strong support level - the most recent Weekly swing low @ 91.71 (which we've highlighted using the blue broken line on the Daily chart) downward. These are strong signs that the bears are fully in control. However, price has currently hit the lower edge of the downward channel - a potential support area, and it's yet to close below it; also, price is yet to gather enough momentum to break below Friday's low (the last trading day low). This current price action is a warning that, though price is in a strong down trend, an upward retracement might be imminent. Consequently, let's keep these support areas in mind. Conservative traders would probably prefer to see price close and break decisively below the lower edge of the downward channel and Friday's low, respectively.  
  
**On the H4 chart** (attached), price has broken the most recent swing low @ 91.42 (which we've highlighted using the blue broken line) downward. That sustains our bias in favor of a downward price move. The white horizontal line @ 92.24 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it - in the absence of any new and lower swing high - our bearish or downward bias remains intact. But, let's not forget the possible price retracement signs discussed on the Daily chart.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts - using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels - to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today's down-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), as discussed yesterday, price is in a strong down trend: price pattern is currently forming lower highs and lower lows. However, from a day-trade perspective, we seem to have an opportunity to temporarily support the dollar against the yen: the potential support area - the lower edge of the downward channel - that was identified yesterday, proved to be strong enough to, at least, halt price's downward movement for more than 24 hours. In addition, Friday's low, which we also discussed yesterday, couldn't be breached. Now, by the end of yesterday, a reversal candle formation - a quasi inside candle - appeared at the lower edge of the downward channel; and then, price recently broke above the previous day high. These current price actions are signaling the opportunity, from a day-trade perspective, to go Long in a possible upward price retracement that, though might be short-lived, has the potential of traveling further north toward the upper edge of the downward channel. This upper edge might likely turn out to be a strong resistance area as it creates a resistance-confluence with a previous support level - the most recent Weekly swing low @ 91.71 (which we've highlighted using the blue broken line on the Daily chart), which should now act as a very strong resistance level. I believe it's safe to seek a Long trade set-up based on our H4 and Hourly charts parameters. But, let's not forget we're in a major down-trend.  
  
**On the H4 chart** (attached), price has broken the most recent swing high @ 91.12 (which we've highlighted using the blue broken line) upward. That shifts our bias in favor of an upward price move. The green horizontal line @ 90.19 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it - in the absence of any new and higher swing low - our bullish or upward bias remains intact. But, again, let's not forget we're in a major down-trend.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts - using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels - to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows. Please note that our aim is to buy a dip in today's up-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

**On the Weekly chart** (attached), we could see that price is in a strong uptrend; however, we are at a critical resistance area: a confluence of fib. 61.8% retracement and the most recent Monthly chart swing high @ 1.4719 (which we've highlighted using the blue broken line on the Weekly chart) tells us price might currently be under intense resistance pressure.  
  
**On the Daily chart** (attached), we have a clearer view of the proximity of price to the critical resistance level @ 1.4719 (that we've highlighted using the upper blue broken line), which we discussed on the Weekly chart. In addition, price is at the upper edge of an upward channel - another sign showing the possibility of resistance pressure. However, the bulls are yet to show signs that they are buckling under any resistance pressure as the previous day candle closed as a bullish candle, and price just broke above the previous day high. Personally, until the bulls show sign of weakness, I'll keep believing they are in control. Nevertheless, it would be wise not to disregard the resistance-confluence. Again, today might be another holiday for conservative traders. For those of us that might want to give the bulls benefit of the doubt, let's be very cautious.  
  
**On the H4 chart** (attached), price has broken the most recent swing high @ 1.4651 (which we've highlighted using the blue broken line) upward. That sustains our bias in favor of an upward price move. The green horizontal line @ 1.4560 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it - in the absence of any new and higher swing low - our bullish or upward bias remains intact.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts - using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels - to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows. Please note that our aim is to buy a dip in today's up-trend.

**On the Daily chart**(attached), the story remains pretty the same as yesterday's: though the bulls keep showing their determination, price is still hovering around the critical resistance area (that we discussed yesterday): a confluence of Weekly fib. 61.8% retracement and the most recent Monthly chart swing high @ 1.4719 (which we've highlighted using the upper blue broken line on the Daily chart). Price also seems resolute on breaking decisively above the upward channel: we would confirm that at the end of today, based on today's candle close. Really, there's no reason to be thinking Short now - though the steep bulls' move seems set for imminent correction. The point is no one can predict precisely when the correction would happen. In all, all that we currently know is that the bulls are still in control. Let's keep on "riding" the bulls with caution.  
  
**On the H4 chart** (attached), price has stayed above the most recent swing high @ 1.4651 (that we've highlighted using the blue broken line), which we've identified since yesterday. That sustains our bias in favor of an upward price move. The green horizontal line @ 1.4640 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it - in the absence of any new and higher swing low - our bullish or upward bias remains intact. However, to buttress our cautious position, we have a very obvious waving negative MACD Divergence. Although, it's not yet a valid divergence, it signals the possibility of an imminent price retracement downward. Let's keep all these warning signs in mind as we look for our Long positions.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts - using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels - to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows. Please note that our aim is to buy a dip in today's up-trend.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), with the support of the Monthly and Weekly charts, the GBPUSD seems to have resumed its bearish move. Price is currently in a symmetrical triangle formation, and on its way toward the lower edge of the triangle formation; we would assume price has got enough room to move further downward. Also buttressing our downward bias is the most recent Daily swing low @ 1.6401 (which we've highlighted using the upper blue broken line) that price recently broke below. A major support level - a previous Daily swing low @ 1.6112 (that we've highlighted using the lower blue broken line), which might likely form a support-confluence with the lower edge of the symmetrical triangle formation, is the next level where we expect the bears to be challenged. Hence, from a day-trade perspective, I believe the coast is clear enough to seek Short trades - with the support of the H4 chart.  
  
**On the H4 chart** (attached), price has broken the most recent swing low @ 1.6433 (which we've highlighted using the blue broken line) downward. That shifts our bias in favor of a downward price move. The white horizontal line @ 1.6567 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it - in the absence of any new and lower swing high - our bearish or downward bias remains intact.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts - using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels - to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today's down-trend.

**On the Daily chart**(attached), we could observe that price has broken above the downward channel, as well as a critical resistance level - the most recent Weekly swing low @ 91.71 (which we've highlighted using the lower blue broken line on the Daily chart). Although, price is yet to close above the 91.71 resistance level (we would only be able to ascertain that after the close of today’s candle), its decisive break above the level suggests a continuation of the bullish correction in a strong downtrend. The next resistance level where price upward correction has a high probability of being halted is @ 93.03 - the fib. 38.2% retracement level, which, combined with a previous Daily swing low @ 93.07 (that we've highlighted using the upper blue broken line), has formed a resistance-confluence. From a day-trade perspective, we seem to have a good opportunity of going Long on the USDJPY as price is still about a 100 pips from the resistance-confluence we just identified  
****  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing high @ 91.60 (which we've highlighted using the blue broken line) upward. That shifts our bias in favor of an upward price move. The green horizontal line @ 91.01 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it - in the absence of any new and higher swing low - our bullish or upward bias remains intact.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts - using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels - to seek promising areas to take our Long positions.

With support of the Daily and H4 charts, we currently have a possible Long trade setup on the USDCHF pair.  
  
**The Hourly chart**(attached) is currently forming a tradable pattern. Price seems to have topped temporarily @ 1.0370. Hence, we expect price to retrace to the area between 1.0329 and 1.0288 (which is the area between the 50% and 100% fib. retracement levels – drawn from the most recent Hourly swing low to the current price-top). Let’s seek to buy around this area. If price exceeds the 1.0288 level downward, our bullish bias is no more valid and we enter a no-trading zone. Our primary profit target is @ 1.0392 (the 127% fib. ext.).  
  
Also, if price breaks above 1.0370 (current price-top) before retracing to the buy-area, we’ll have to redraw our Fibonacci tools using a new top & the most recent Hourly swing low to determine new potential areas to buy.  
  
**The 15min. chart**(attached) gives us a clearer view of the Hourly price action and the potential areas to buy (please note it’s advisable to set a Limit order ahead of time as price could move down to these level and reverse sharply in our favor)  
This chart is rather cluttered but if we look closely, there are a number of potential reversal levels available. You choose your preferred level based on your personality.  
  
fib 50.8% ret. @ 1.0329  
fib 61.8% ret. @ 1.0319;   
fib 78.6% ret. @ 1.0306.   
  
Personally, based on the broken most-recent Hourly swing high @ 1.0311, which I believe is a potentially strong reversal level, I would be going for the 78.6% ret.   
  
Initial Stop Loss @ 1.0286; primary Profit target @ 1.0390 (Please remember to factor in your broker’s pip-spread).  
  
Please note that all these Fibonacci (fib.) levels have other pivots, overlapping fibs or previous highs/lows supporting them (they are the cause of this cluttered chart). As such, price could reverse at any of the points. The issue here is that the deeper the fib level you choose to buy from, the smaller the pips you’ll risk and the more your pip-profit; BUT, also the more the likelihood of you missing the trade as price might not retrace that deep before moving back upward.  
You need your own discretion here.  
  
Please keep your risk low. Don’t risk more than 2% of your capital. Personally, I risk about 0.5% per trade; and each trade has a potential profit target of 1% or more – based on my exit levels.  
We MUST NEVER assume we KNOW where price is going next!  
  
P.S.:   
Similar Short trade set-up is forming on the EURUSD pair.  
Also, always keep in mind any major news releases. Be wary of possible price volatility during these periods.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), we keep experiencing an unrelenting bulls’ rush. Last week, we observed a critical resistance area: a confluence of Weekly fib. 61.8% retracement, and the most recent Monthly chart swing high @ 1.4719 (which we've highlighted using the blue broken line on the Daily chart). As anticipated, the 1.4719 resistance-confluence made its impact felt as it halted the bulls’ move for two trading days. However, at the beginning of today, the bulls gave an indication that they were determined to continue their dominance as price broke above the most recent Daily swing high @ 1.4766 (not highlighted to avoid cluttered chart). Personally, the current rally has been a steep one, and, consequently, a major retracement – as we’ve been discussing since last week – might be imminent. However, what we currently know is that the bulls aren’t showing signs of weakness. From a day-trade perspective, let’s keep seeking Long trade setups until the bears give us signs that they are ready to challenge the bulls.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing high @ 1.4735 (that we've highlighted using the lower blue broken line) upward. That shifts our bias in favor of an upward price move. The green horizontal line @ 1.4610 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it - in the absence of any new and higher swing low - our bullish or upward bias remains intact.   
Pls NOTE: The most recent Daily swing high @ 1.4766, which we discussed on the Daily chart, is highlighted on the H4 chart with the upper blue broken line.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts - using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels - to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows. Please note that our aim is to buy a dip in today's up-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), again, earlier today we experienced another bullish price action: price-break above the previous day’s high. Much earlier, the previous day’s candle closed above the most recent Daily swing high @ 1.4766 (which we've highlighted using the blue broken line). These signs are confirming that the bulls are probably ready to push further. However, as mentioned yesterday: “personally, the current rally has been a steep one, and, consequently, a major retracement – as we’ve been discussing since last week – might be imminent.” But again, what we currently know is that the bulls are yet to show signs of weakness – at least on the Daily chart; hence, from a day-trade perspective, let’s keep seeking Long trade setups until price action indicates otherwise.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing high @ 1.4820 (which we've highlighted using the blue broken line) upward. That sustains our bias in favor of an upward price move. However, a couple of price actions are indicating an imminent downward price retracement in a very strong uptrend: the first price action is the reversal candle formation (a hammer or inside candle – depending on the way we see it as individuals) right on the most recent swing high @ 1.4820; a sign that the bulls are really struggling to maintain their hold. The second warning signal is a waving negative MACD Divergence (highlighted using the red lines on both panes of the chart), which, although yet to be a valid divergence, is a relatively good sign that the bears are prepared to take over – even if just temporarily. In all, as mentioned on the Daily chart, the bulls are still in charge, BUT please, let’s be mindful of the warning signs.   
The green horizontal line @ 1.4610 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it - in the absence of any new and higher swing low - our bullish or upward bias remains intact.   
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts - using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels - to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows. Please note that our aim is to buy a dip in today's up-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

**On the Daily chart** (attached) – in agreement with the Weekly and Monthly charts – the bears are currently showing signs of recovery as price reversed on its way toward the upper edge of the symmetrical triangle to retest the triangle’s lower edge. However, the triangle’s lower edge – forming a support-confluence with the Daily chart most recent swing low @ 1.6132 (which we've highlighted using the blue broken line) – remains a critical level that the bears must breach decisively to prove their strength. Early price action today shows price has travelled a considerable range, and there’s the possibility we would experience relatively low activity afterward; hence we might not be having an opportunity for a suitable setup for today. However, high or low activity wouldn’t be a determining factor regarding our bias. While, our bias – with the support of higher time frame charts – remains bearish, price is currently around the support-confluence that we discussed earlier, consequently, an upward retracement is very possible  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing low @ 1.6328 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) downward. That price action automatically shifted our bias in favor of a downward price move. Again, let’s be very conscious of the fact that price is around a support-confluence. The white horizontal line @ 1.6468 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), much quicker than anticipated, the bears are recovering lost ground. Yesterday, we discussed that the GBPUSD Daily chart – in agreement with the Weekly and Monthly charts – supported the idea that the bears were showing signs of recovery as price reversed on its way toward the upper edge of the symmetrical triangle to retest the triangle’s lower edge; and that the triangle’s lower edge – forming a support-confluence with the Daily chart most recent swing low @ 1.6132 (which we've highlighted using the upper blue broken line) – remained a critical level that the bears must breach decisively to prove their strength.   
Before the close of yesterday’s candle, the bears did not just breach the support-confluence, they broke below it decisively with over 350-pip move. Now, all we could expect – based on these recent price actions – is further downward price movement for, probably, a protracted period of time. Our bias is simply bearish. However, price is currently at another critical support level – a previous Daily and Weekly charts swing low @ 1.5982 (which we've highlighted using the lower blue broken line); while our bias is bearish, let’s keep this level in mind as we seek our Short trade setups – with the support of the H4 chart.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price – since yesterday – had broken the most recent swing low @ 1.6328 (which we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line) downward. That automatically sustains our bias in favor of a downward price move. The white horizontal line @ 1.6468 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.  
Please NOTE that the strength of the critical support level @ 1.5982 (that we've highlighted using the lower blue broken line), which we discussed on the Daily chart, is more visible on the H4 chart as we already have a reversal candle formation (railway tracks) around the level. Let’s expect an upward price retracement, which, possibly, would aid a Short trade setup on the Hourly chart.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

With support of the Daily and H4 charts, we currently have a possible Short trade setup on the USDJPY pair.  
  
**The Hourly chart**(attached) is currently forming a tradable pattern. Price seems to have bottomed temporarily @ 89.95. Hence, we expect price to retrace to the area between 90.38 and 90.81 (which is the area between the 50% and 100% fib. retracement levels – drawn from the most recent Hourly swing high to the current price-bottom). Let’s seek to sell around this area. If price exceeds the 90.81 level upward, our bearish bias is no more valid and we enter a no-trading zone. Our primary profit target is @ 89.72 (the 127% fib. ext.).  
  
Also, if price breaks below 89.95 (current price-bottom) before retracing to the sell-area, we’ll have to redraw our Fibonacci tools using a new bottom & the most recent Hourly swing high to determine new potential areas to sell.  
  
**The 15min. chart**(attached) gives us a clearer view of the Hourly price action and the potential areas to sell (please note it’s advisable to set a Limit order ahead of time as price could move up to these levels and reverse sharply in our favor).  
This chart is rather cluttered but if we look closely, there are a couple of potential reversal levels available. You choose your preferred level based on your personality.  
  
fib 61.8% ret. @ 90.48;   
fib 78.6% ret. @ 90.63.   
  
Personally, based on the broken most-recent Hourly swing low @ 90.54, which I believe is a potentially strong reversal level, I would be going for the 61.8% ret.   
  
Initial Stop Loss @ 90.83; primary Profit target @ 89.72 (Please remember to factor in your broker’s pip-spread).  
  
Please note that all these Fibonacci (fib.) levels have other pivots, overlapping fibs or previous highs/lows supporting them (they are the cause of this cluttered chart). As such, price could reverse at any of the points. The issue here is that the higher the fib level you choose to sell from, the smaller the pips you’ll risk and the more your pip-profit; BUT, also the more the likelihood of you missing the trade as price might not retrace that high before moving back downward.  
You need your own discretion here.  
  
Please keep your risk low. Don’t risk more than 2% of your capital. Personally, I risk about 0.5% per trade; and each trade has a potential profit target of 1% or more – based on my exit levels.  
We MUST NEVER assume we KNOW where price is going next!  
  
P.S.:   
Please keep in mind any major news releases. Be wary of possible price volatility during these periods.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), toward the end of last week, the bulls finally succumbed to strong resistance levels. One of the resistance levels is the upward channel: we would observe that, although price seemed to have initially broken above the upward channel, it could not sustain its upward surge, and consequently, a strong reversal candle formation (railway tracks) was formed at the close of last week Wednesday’s candle. Currently, we have a sign that price has probably resolved to have a downward retracement: the most recent Daily swing low @ 1.4610 (which we've highlighted using the blue broken line) has been broken downward. We expect price to continue its downward retracement toward the lower edge of the channel; however let’s keep in mind that there are a couple of support levels – previous Daily swing highs – that the bears might have to break through to reach the channel’s lower edge. In all, from a day-trade perspective, with the support of the H4 chart, our bias is to seek Short trade setups on the Hourly chart  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing low @ 1.4622 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) downward. That automatically sustains our bias in favor of a downward price move. We would also observe that price is currently forming lower highs and lower lows: another good formation confirming the bears’ control. The white horizontal line @ 1.4723 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.  
  
_Please NOTE: We currently have an Hourly Short trade setup with a nice resistance-confluence around the fib 50% ret. @ 1.4641 (Primary profit target @ 1.4523; Initial SL @ 1.4721). If this level is suitable for you – in terms of reward:risk, don’t hesitate to take the trade. Please manage your trade properly: don’t risk too much, scale out your profits and adjust your stop loss when necessary._

**On the Daily chart** (attached), price currently seems to be in an upward retracement – in a strong downtrend: we could observe a number of reversal candle formations at the lower edge of the downward or bearish channel. Also, yesterday’s candle closed as a bullish candle. Consequently, current price action supports our bullish bias. We expect price to continue its upward retracement toward the upper edge of the downward channel. However, from a day-trade perspective, we would prefer to see price break above yesterday’s high @ 1.0374 before we are fully convinced to seek a Long trade setup.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), we currently have a higher high and higher low formation: a good sign supporting a bullish bias. However, price is yet to break above the most recent swing high – also yesterday’s high – @ 1.0374 (which we've highlighted using the blue broken line). The 1.0374 level, from a day-trade perspective, is a critical resistance level that we would prefer to see broken upward before we seek Long trade setups on the Hourly chart. The green horizontal line @ 1.0276 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it - in the absence of any new and higher swing low - our bullish or upward bias remains intact.   
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts - using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels - to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows. Please note that our aim is to buy a dip in today's up-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

Earlier today, we concluded today’s bias is to go Long.  
  
**The Hourly chart**(attached) is currently forming a tradable pattern. Price seems to have topped temporarily @ 1.0403. Hence, we expect price to retrace to the area between 1.0357 and 1.0311 (which is the area between the 50% and 100% fib. retracement levels – drawn from the most recent Hourly swing low to the current price-top). Let’s seek to buy around this area. If price exceeds the 1.0311 level downward, our bullish bias is no more valid and we enter a no-trading zone. Our primary profit target is @ 1.0428 (the 127% fib. ext.).  
  
Also, if price breaks above 1.0403 (current price-top) before retracing to the buy-area, we’ll have to redraw our Fibonacci tools using a new top & the most recent Hourly swing low to determine new potential areas to buy.  
  
**The 15min. chart**(attached) gives us a clearer view of the Hourly price action and the potential areas to buy (please note it’s advisable to set a Limit order ahead of time as price could move down to these level and reverse sharply in our favor)  
This chart is rather cluttered but if we look closely, there are a couple of potential reversal levels available. You choose your preferred level based on your personality.  
  
fib 61.8% ret. @ 1.0346;   
fib 78.6% ret. @ 1.0331.   
  
Personally, based on the broken most-recent Hourly swing high @ 1.0347, which I believe is a potentially strong reversal level, I would prefer the 61.8% ret.   
  
Initial Stop Loss @ 1.0309; primary Profit target @ 1.0426 (Please remember to factor in your broker’s pip-spread).  
  
Please note that all these Fibonacci (fib.) levels have other pivots, overlapping fibs or previous highs/lows supporting them (they are the cause of this cluttered chart). As such, price could reverse at any of the points. The issue here is that the deeper the fib level you choose to buy from, the smaller the pips you’ll risk and the more your pip-profit; BUT, also the more the likelihood of you missing the trade as price might not retrace that deep before moving back upward.  
You need your own discretion here.  
  
Please keep your risk low. Don’t risk more than 2% of your capital. Personally, I risk about 0.5% per trade; and each trade has a potential profit target of 1% or more – based on my exit levels.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), we would observe that the GBPUSD is in a downtrend; however, from a day-trade perspective, we seem to have an opportunity to Long the pair: Yesterday, price completed a reversal candle pattern at the lower edge of the downward or bearish channel, and earlier today, price broke above the previous day high @ 1.5988. These signs suggest we are in a bullish retracement in a longer term downtrend. We have a critical resistance level – the most recent Daily swing low @ 1.6132 (which we've highlighted using the blue broken line). The 1.6132 level might halt the bullish retracement. Another resistance area that is currently some pips above the 1.6132 level is a downward trend-line (red solid line). These resistance areas are very critical, especially because we are in downtrend – supported by higher time frame charts. Again, from a day-trade perspective, we could still go with the bulls, but with extreme caution when managing our trades.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing high @ 1.5988 (which we've highlighted using the lower blue broken line) upward. That shifts our bias in favor of an upward price move. The green horizontal line @ 1.5823 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it - in the absence of any new and higher swing low - our bullish or upward bias remains intact.  
Please NOTE: Let’s keep in mind that we are in a longer term downtrend. The critical resistance levels that we discussed on the Daily chart are shown on the H4 chart to have a clearer observation regarding their proximity to price action: we’re about 60 pips to the most recent Daily swing low @ 1.6132 (which we've highlighted using the upper blue broken line), and still quite a distance from the downward trend-line. We would prefer to see price break above the 1.6132 level, to be more convinced of enough room for further bullish retracement toward the downward trend-line.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts - using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels - to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows. Please note that our aim is to buy a dip in today's up-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), price is currently having a bullish retracement in a downtrend. We anticipate that price would travel upward toward the upper edge of the downward or bearish channel before any major resistance. The strength of the channel’s upper edge is buttressed by a cluster of old support levels (around 1.0550) – that we expect to now act as a critical resistance area – which might be forming a resistance-confluence with the upper edge. However, from a day-trade perspective, the previous day’s high @ 1.0449 (which we've highlighted using the blue broken line) might pose a threat to further upward price move, hence, it would be safer for us to see price break above the 1.0449 level before seeking Long trade setups on the Hourly chart – supported by the H4 chart.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), we would observe that price is in a bullish channel formation. There are a couple of previous swing highs that are acting as resistance levels within the channel; hence, to have a clearer coast for our Long trades, we would prefer to see price break above the upper edge of the upward or bullish channel, which would be confirmed by price break above the most recent swing high – also the previous day’s high – @ 1.0449 (which we've highlighted using the blue broken line).  
The green horizontal line @ 1.0336 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it - in the absence of any new and higher swing low - our bullish or upward bias remains intact.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts - using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels - to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows. Please note that our aim is to buy a dip in today's up-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

**Pls NOTE:** Today is another first Friday, hence we expect the Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) report to have its impact on the general behavior of the markets. Again, as I’ve always said, today – as with most first Fridays of every month – is one particular day that trending method/pattern traders should be wary of trading most. Based on personal experience, early market hours are usually dull, afterward, usually around the news release, we have extreme volatility, which disrupts any recognizable chart patterns; hence, the entire trading day becomes virtually un-tradable.   
While I’ll go ahead to give my personal analysis on the EURUSD pair, please, let’s bear in mind that, regardless of any technical analyses, NFP usually rules today.  
  
**On the Daily chart** above, since price broke below the most recent Daily swing low @ 1.4610 (which we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line), our bias has turned bearish. Hence we expect price to travel further south toward the lower edge of the upward or bullish channel, where, currently, we also have a critical support level – a previous Daily swing high @ 1.4405 (which we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line).  
  
**On the H4 chart** above, price has broken the most recent swing low @ 1.4574 (which we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line) downward. This automatically shifts our bias in favor of a downward price move. We would observe that price is also within a bearish channel on the H4 chart, and the coast seems quite clear for price to continue its southward trip toward the lower edge of the bearish or downward channel, which, coincidentally, also currently aligns with the 1.4405 support level (that we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line), which we discussed on the Daily chart.  
The white horizontal line @ 1.4672 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

Thanks freedomsg; the 4 hr time frame is also very good – especially if you don’t have much time at your disposal. Personally, I believe the most important thing is for you to feel comfortable with the primary time frame (as well as the trading method) you’re using, as that would aid discipline, which is one of the most important factors in trading.  
  
To keep this thread simple, only Hourly chart trade setups are discussed. However, regardless of the time frame you choose to trade, the higher time frames analyses on the thread will surely help with your trading decisions. There’re a number of related threads that discuss Fibonacci usage on the 4 hr TF, which you might find helpful; but, if you still want my personal input – beyond the scope of this thread – you can contact me through email. Thanks again freedomsg.  
  
I wish you and everyone a fulfilling week.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), since late September, price has been having a bullish retracement, in a downtrend. We anticipated that price would travel upward toward the upper edge of the downward or bearish channel before any major resistance. However, the most recent Daily swing high @ 1.0387 (which we've highlighted using the blue broken line) seems to be a strong resistance level that price is struggling to break upward – decisively: In the past couple of trading days, price had formed reversal candle formations (a doji & a quasi railway track) around the 1.0387 level. Consequently, price might be getting set to continue its downward move. To buttress a downward bias, price recently breached Friday’s low @ 1.0308 (not highlighted to avoid cluttered chart). In all, our current bias tends toward a bearish move, but the coast is quite unclear: conservative traders might prefer to refrain from taking trades, for now.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken a recent swing low @ 1.0336 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) downward. That automatically shifts our bias in favor of a downward price move. However, the current H4 price action strengthens our view that the coast is somewhat unclear: price is struggling to stay comfortably below the broken swing low. It would be much preferable to see a clean break before seeking an Hourly Short trade setup.   
The white horizontal line @ 1.0435 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.   
****  
However, for the more aggressive ones among us, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

Thanks Dliberators, I’m quite aware you usually use the H4 charts for your entries. There’s been no Short trade setups on the USDCHF Hourly chart, so I’m yet to take any trade based on the thread’s method.

Hello Tunji, perhaps i dont have a clear understanding of your entry style yet.. kindly help clarify by my chart.. would you not have gone in at the 61.8/78.6 fib..perhaps i have my fib placed wrongly from how you place yours...   
  
Also wat do u think of EU..i'm watching to go long on the 4hr tf or 1hr tf if there's a retracement.  
  
Thanks for your help....  
  
Victor.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), as anticipated yesterday, the bulls’ movement has been decisively halted, and price seems to have resumed its long term downtrend. The next major support level, where we expect the bears’ resolve to be tested, is the most recent Daily swing low – also the year-low – @ 1.0178 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line). From a day-trade perspective, there seems to be enough room for us to seek Short trade setups on the Hourly chart – supported by the H4 chart.

Victor, you’re absolutely correct with the 61.8%. There was a nice setup at that level. Actually, I always prefer to go for a confluence that includes the most recent “broken” swing high/low. In the case of USDCHF in question (chart attached), the most recent swing low @ 1.0308 (highlighted using the upper blue broken line) aligns with the 61.8% – and another overlapping fib, & pivot – which made it a valid Short trade setup.  
However, with a new swing high just forming @ 1.0272 (highlighted using the lower blue broken line), the Hourly Short trade is no more valid, since the Hourly fib. must be drawn from the most recent swing high.  
Price’s move above the most recent swing high automatically violates the lower high, lower low formation, which is one of the basic parameters of the method.  
  
Hope the explanation isn’t too confusing.  
  
Regarding the EURUSD (chart also attached), there would’ve been a nice Long trade setup on the fib. 50%, as it aligns with the most recent “broken” swing high @ 1.4668. However, no suitable overlapping fib.   
Besides, I don’t use 50%, primarily because of the reward/risk ratio that is less than 2:1.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), as with other higher time frame charts (Weekly and Monthly), it’s very much apparent that we are in a strong downtrend. The bears seem unrelenting. From a day-trade perspective, the scenario is not in any way different: a major support level – the most recent Daily swing low – @ 88.22 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) has been breached. That price action indicates price is still prepared to move further downward. The year’s low @ 87.10 (not visible on the Daily chart) is currently about a 100 pips away, hence there seems to be enough room for the downward move – again, that’s from a day-trade perspective.  
However, let’s be wary of the 88.00 level as it is an area where some institutional traders have “large stop-loss sales lurked.”  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing low @ 88.61 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) downward. That automatically sustains our bias in favor of a downward price move. The white horizontal line @ 89.03 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.   
****  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

Hi, Tunji:  
  
I am a newbie in the trading arena. I’ve been searching for effective method of using Fibonacci retracement/extension. Your trading method is very promising. I had read/studied every post in this thread. Thank you very much for teaching me.  
  
On the attached chart (posted 10/07/09), the recent swing high and swing low, from my understanding, are point A (swing high) and point B (swing low). I appreciate if you can point it out the reason for picking the point C as recent swing low.   
  
I am eagerly want to learn. Thanks.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), we would observe that the EURUSD is in a very strong uptrend; an uptrend that started around March, this year (2009). Although, the uptrend is still seen as a bullish retracement on the Monthly chart, as far as we are concerned, from a shorter term point of view, we are in a strong uptrend. The bulls resumed their control on Friday, last week, and since then, we’ve somewhat been in a steady upward movement. From a day-trade perspective, we seem to have enough room to still long the pair. We expect price to continue its upward move toward the year high – also the most recent Daily swing high – @ 1.4843 (which we've highlighted using the blue broken line). The 1.4843 is a critical resistance level, hence let’s be cautious as price advances toward it. The 1.4843 level would also, most likely, be supported by the upper edge of the upward or bullish channel.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing high @ 1.4736 (which we've highlighted using the lower blue broken line) upward. That sustains our bias in favor of an upward price move. The 1.4843 level (that we've highlighted using the upper blue broken line), which we discussed on the Daily chart, is shown on the H4 chart to give us a clearer view of its proximity to current price position. We have about 70 pips gap, which gives enough room to seek Long trades – from a day-trade perspective; however, let’s still be very conscious of the level.  
The green horizontal line @ 1.4649 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it - in the absence of any new and higher swing low - our bullish or upward bias remains intact.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts - using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels - to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows. Please note that our aim is to buy a dip in today's up-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

Hello Dalla, thanks for your kind words. I determine my swing lows based on a candle with two higher candles (not one) on both sides; and vice versa for swing highs.  
If you’re using MT4 trading platform, you can check out the “Fractals” tool: it indentifies swing highs/lows in a very similar way.  
  
P.S.:   
Point B was actually the most recent swing low – not point C; it wasn’t very noticeable as the second higher candle on the right was only a pip or two higher; but all the same, it was a mistake. Sorry about that.

Hello Freedomsg, I would’ve loved to reply much earlier, but I hope my explanation is still useful. I’ve attached a similar chart to yours, for clearer explanation.  
  
The 38.2% seems nice to me, primarily because of its alignment with a previous swing high @ 1.4736 (highlighted with the lower blue line) and a Monthly pivot. It would have been in line with the thread’s method if there was an overlapping fib. – though the reward/risk ratio would not have been good.   
Also, a new swing low had formed @ 1.4741 (upper blue line), which nullified the “most recent swing low” status of the swing low @ 1.4649 (1.4650 on your chart). Based on this thread’s method, you always use the most recent Hourly swing high/low to draw your fib.  
Obviously, subsequent price action proved the 38.2% level as a strong support, which is good to know; but, all the same, the parameters for the Hourly Fib. method weren’t fully met.  
  
To answer your profit target question: yes, assuming all the method’s parameters were in place, the profit target @ 127% fib ext. (1.4823) was below the year high @ 1.4843.  
  
P.S.: Confluence @ 38.2% seems more distinct than the one @ 61.8%

Hi Tunji, thank you for the insight. I learn from u daily indeed. I am working right now, I bought long at 38.2% last night, does it hit the 127% and retrace down. I can only know down to 61.8%. Thanks

**On the Daily chart** (attached), two days ago – on Wednesday – we identified the 88.00 level as “an area where some institutional traders _had_ “large stop-loss sales lurked.” Although, we didn’t place primary emphasis on it in the analysis, it arguably turned out to be the sole driving force of the USDJPY pair since then. During the very early hours of today, price rallied by almost 100 pips; and currently, the pair has moved more than a 100 pips upward. As a result, price pierced sharply above the steep downward or bearish trend-line. Though price is yet to close above the trend-line (that would be determined after close of today’s candle), its big break above the trend-line – in addition to the strong 88.00 support level – gives us an inkling that a bullish retracement, probably, has started.   
We expect the bulls to meet their next major resistance around a major Daily swing low @ 90.11 (that we've highlighted using the upper blue broken line), which might be forming a resistance-confluence with the upper bearish trend-line (the bold red line).  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing high @ 88.68 (which we've highlighted using the lower blue broken line) upward. That shifts our bias in favor of an upward price move. Price action around the steep bearish trend-line, which we discussed on the Daily chart, is clearer on the H4 chart: we already have a candle closed above the trend-line, and that buttresses our bullish bias. The critical resistance level – a Daily swing low @ 90.11, which we also discussed on the Daily chart, could also be seen on the H4 chart: from a day-trade perspective, we seem to have enough room for further bullish move – although over 100-pip move already made today might restrain any new price rally.  
The green horizontal line @ 88.13 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it - in the absence of any new and higher swing low - our bullish or upward bias remains intact.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts - using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels - to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows. Please note that our aim is to buy a dip in today's up-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

Hi Tunji, what do you mean by "the parameters for the hourly Fib method weren't fully meet? Thanks

Freedomsg, I was referring to the primary method discussed on this thread. A few of the parameters necessary to make the trade a valid one – based on the thread’s method – were not in place. For instance, I mentioned the case of no overlapping fib., and a nullified “most recent swing low.”   
  
Please note that that didn’t automatically make the trade a bad trade, it could have been an appropriate trade, based on another method’s necessary factors or parameters.

Hi Tunji, thank u. I base on yr analysis on the USD/JPY yesterday, got a few nice pips while I was asleep. Some questions to seek you to answer. Did I go in to the trade late?   
.Should I go long once it hit the 61.8 line or I need to wait for the 1 hr candle to close?   
.Or I need to wait till the next next candle to go above the previous candle high than I can buy?   
.My move yesterday was wait for it to bounce off 61.8 and close above 38.2 then I go long. It seem a little too late.   
.I put my tp below the 1.382 below before I go to bed. GMT+8 (Singapore). Was my tp set correctly?  
.I am having a problem on when should I go in to buy/sell once it hit the Fib line. Must I go down to lower TF to trigger the trade?   
The two blue dotted lines were my buy and tp lines.   
Thank you and have a nice weekend Tunji.

Hi Freedomsg, sincerely, the issue of entry style is an individual thing. Personally, I don’t wait for any candle formation; I simply place my Limit Order(s) at a certain support or resistance level where I expect price to reverse favorably, get filled automatically, and wait for the s/r level to prove itself.  
As you rightly observed, waiting for candle closes or breakouts could sometimes make you enter the trade late, or miss out of the trade completely. On the other hand, if you’re using Limit Orders, you lose the security the candle confirmation provides, as price could trigger your Limit Order, continue rushing downward (assuming you’re going long) to hit your Stop Loss.   
So, in a way, it really depends on your personality. I’m very ok with using Limit Order – at times it helps, and at times, it disappoints; but, as you probably know, success in trading isn’t as much of how many winning trades we have, but more of how much confidence (or faith) we have in what we do, and how well we manage our winning and losing trades.  
  
Based on the point you used to draw your fibo. tool, 89.68 is only a few pips below the primary profit target – the fib. 127% ext. @ 89.76, and that isnt too bad, as I believe it’s only smart to take your Long trade profits a few pips below your primary profit target – and not wait for the exact target.  
  
Thanks Freedomsg; and I wish you and everyone a fulfilling week.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), since the latter part of last month, we’ve been having what I would consider an interesting price action, which resulted in sort of a channel formation (as observed within the two blue horizontal lines): Price, after failing to breach the, at that time, most recent swing low (not highlighted to avoid cluttered chart), retraced upward, only to meet an uncompromising “veteran” resistance level, which “produced” the most recent Daily swing high @ 1.6132 (that we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line). With the stiff resistance, price had to turn around, again, to retest the previous swing low, which, also by now, has “produced” the most recent Daily swing low @ 1.5808 (which we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line). Now, price is showing signs that it is not prepared to be sent back upward: the most recent Daily swing low @ 1.5808 has been breached; however, for further bearish move confirmation, we would like to see price to, not only close below the 1.5808 level by the end of today, but also below the lower edge of the downward or bearish channel. In all, with the support of higher time frame charts, our bias is currently bearish; but conservative traders might prefer to wait for today’s candle close to make their final conclusion.  
Also, trade volume would most likely be thin today as there’re bank holidays in Japan, US, and Canada; and that might result in unusual or erratic price movements. Please let’s also bear that in mind if we would be trading.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing low @ 1.5857 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) downward. That automatically shifts our bias in favor of a downward price move. The white horizontal line @ 1.6119 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.   
****  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), yesterday, with the support of higher time frame charts, we concluded our bias was bearish, but that we would like to see price to, not only close below the most recent Daily swing low @ 1.5808 (which we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line) by the end of yesterday, but also below the lower edge of the downward or bearish channel. As at the end of yesterday, though price closed @ 1.5798 – slightly below the 1.5808 level, it was unable to close, clearly, below the downward or bearish channel. However, current price action is strengthening our bearish bias: price recently breached yesterday’s low @ 1.5727 (not highlighted to avoid cluttered chart). This single price action, with the support of previous price actions, is quite good enough for us to seek Short trade setups on the Hourly charts – supported by the H4 charts.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached) price has broken the most recent swing low @ 1.5727 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) downward. That automatically sustains our bias in favor of a downward price move. Please NOTE that 1.5727 – the most recent swing low level – also happens to be yesterday’s low, which we discussed on the Daily chart.  
The white horizontal line @ 1.5882 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.

However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions.

If you were able to identify the EURUSD Long trade set-up, which occurred yesterday – around 14:00 GMT – and took the trade, that’s great.  
  
**On** **the Hourly chart** (attached), we had a support-confluence around, at that time, the most recent “broken” swing high @ 1.4800. The support-confluence included the swing high, overlapping fibs, and a Daily pivot. Less than an hour ago, price hit the primary profit target – the 127% ext. @ 1.4905. If you managed your trade properly, scaling out your profits and adjusting your Stop Loss appropriately, you would’ve had a minimum of 2:1 reward/risk profit i.e. your profit would’ve, at least, doubled the amount you initially risked.   
  
P.S.:  
This trade was fully supported by the H4 chart price action.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), on Friday, last week, we anticipated a bullish retracement based on price’s sharp break above the lower trend-line – which was, most likely, aided by the strong support area @ 88.00 (that we've highlighted using the lower blue broken line). Based on further analysis, we also noted, using the following words, that: _“We expect the bulls to meet their next major resistance around a major Daily swing low @ 90.11 (that we've highlighted using the upper blue broken line), which might be forming a resistance-confluence with the upper bearish trend-line (the bold red line).”_  
In line with our analysis, the rally stalled around the 90.11 level; and currently, preceded by previous two days’ reversal candle formations, the bears seem ready to continue their movement. We expect major support around the same 88.00 support level, which previously was unbreakable for the bears. From a day trade perspective, we seem to have enough room to seek Short trades.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing low @ 89.61 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) downward. That automatically shifts our bias in favor of a downward price move. The white horizontal line @ 90.02 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), since the beginning of this month, the bulls have been raging; and, though we might have a bearish retracement soon, the bulls seem determined to hold on to their reign for sometime: major resistance levels are being breached on the Weekly and Monthly charts, and the fundamentals – recent economic reports – are fully in support of a sustained rally; although, uncertainties still abound. Price is currently around the upper edge of the upward or bullish channel, hence, there’s a possibility of, at least, a short lived bearish retracement; after which we expect price to find support around the most recent Daily swing high @ 1.4817 (which we've highlighted using the blue broken line). It might take more than a whole day for us to see the above explanation unfold – if we happen to have judged correctly; however, since no price action is currently supporting a suitable bearish move, it’s advisable to wait for a Hourly chart Long trade setup, which must be confirmed by Hourly price pattern forming higher highs and higher lows, and supported by the H4 chart.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing high @ 1.4874 (which we've highlighted using the lower blue broken line) upward. That sustains our bias in favor of an upward price move. The green horizontal line @ 1.4761 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it - in the absence of any new and higher swing low - our bullish or upward bias remains intact.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts - using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels - to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows. Please note that our aim is to buy a dip in today's up-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), earlier this week, we expected further bearish movement – in line with the major downtrend, however, the bulls proved they weren’t prepared to let go just yet. Price continued its upward retracement, broke above the most recent Daily swing high @ 90.45 (which we've highlighted using the lower blue broken line); and now, it seems set to test the next resistance level – a resistance confluence of fib 38.2% ret. and the most recent Weekly swing low @ 91.71 (which we've highlighted using the upper blue broken line). From a day-trade perspective, though price has already moved a considerable distance today, we can still seek opportunities to go Long, using our Hourly charts.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing high @ 90.77 (which we've highlighted using the blue broken line) upward. That sustains our bias in favor of an upward price move. The green horizontal line @ 88.82 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it - in the absence of any new and higher swing low - our bullish or upward bias remains intact.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), we seem to be getting signals that price is probably set to resume its movement in direction of a strong downward trend – supported by the Weekly and Monthly charts, as well as a number of chart patterns on the Daily chart, which include a head and shoulders formation (as shown). Earlier today, price breached Friday’s low @ 1.6251: a relatively good sign that the bears are ready to resume their activities. From a day-trade perspective, we seem to have the opportunity to short the GBPUSD pair. The most recent Daily swing high @ 1.6119 is a support level we have to bear in mind: the bears might encounter hurdles around this level.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has breached the most recent swing low @ 1.6251 (which we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line) downward. That automatically shifts our bias in favor of a downward price move. The 1.6119 support level, which we discussed on the Daily chart, is also shown on the H4 chart (the lower blue broken line). Price is currently over a 100 pips from this support level; hence, we seem to have enough room to seek Short trades.  
The white horizontal line @ 1.6398 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.   
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), in the past two weeks, we’ve been experiencing a bullish retracement in a strong downtrend. We expected price to move up toward the resistance-confluence of fib 38.2% ret. and the most recent Weekly swing low @ 91.71 (which we've highlighted using the upper blue broken line). However, the bulls couldn’t garner enough strength to push that high: they were stopped about 40 pips away @ 91.31. Currently, buoyed by the longer term downtrend, our bias is bearish. The next critical support level is the most recent Daily swing low @ 88.82 (which we've highlighted using the lower blue broken line).  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing low @ 90.35 (which we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line) downward. That automatically sustains our bias in favor of a downward price move. The 88.82 support level, which we discussed on the Daily chart, is also shown on the H4 chart (the lower blue broken line). Price is currently more than 150 pips away from this support level; hence, we seem to have enough room to seek Short trades.  
The white horizontal line @ 91.31 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.   
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

Earlier today, we concluded today’s bias is to go Short.  
  
**The Hourly chart**(attached) is currently forming a tradable pattern. Price seems to have bottomed temporarily @ 90.06. Hence, we expect price to retrace to the area between 90.42 and 90.78 (which is the area between the 50% and 100% fib. retracement levels – drawn from the most recent Hourly swing high to the current price-bottom). Let’s seek to sell around this area. If price exceeds the 90.78 level upward, our bearish bias is no more valid and we enter a no-trading zone. Our primary profit target is @ 89.87 (the 127% fib. ext.).  
  
Also, if price breaks below 90.06 (current price-bottom) before retracing to the sell-area, we’ll have to redraw our Fibonacci tools using a new bottom & the most recent Hourly swing high to determine new potential areas to sell.  
  
**The 15min. chart**(attached) gives us a clearer view of the Hourly price action and the potential areas to sell (please note it’s advisable to set a Limit order ahead of time as price could move up to these levels and reverse sharply in our favor).  
This chart is rather cluttered but if we look closely, there are a couple of potential reversal levels available. You choose your preferred level based on your personality.  
  
fib 50% ret. @ 90.42;   
fib 61.8% ret. @ 90.51.   
  
Personally, based on the broken most-recent Hourly swing low @ 90.49, which I believe is a potentially strong reversal level; I would opt for the 61.8% ret.  
  
Initial Stop Loss @ 90.80; primary Profit target @ 89.87 (Please remember to factor in your broker’s pip-spread).  
  
Please note that all these Fibonacci (fib.) levels have other pivots, overlapping fibs or previous highs/lows supporting them (they are the cause of this cluttered chart). As such, price could reverse at any of the points. The issue here is that the higher the fib level you choose to sell from, the smaller the pips you’ll risk and the more your pip-profit; BUT, also the more the likelihood of you missing the trade as price might not retrace that high before moving back downward.  
You need your own discretion here.  
  
Please keep your risk low. Don’t risk more than 2% of your capital. Personally, I risk about 0.5% per trade; and each trade has a potential profit target of about 1% – based on my exit levels.  
We MUST NEVER assume we KNOW where price is going next!  
  
P.S.:   
Also, always keep in mind any major news releases. Be wary of possible price volatility during these periods.

The USDJPY short trade didn’t completely work out as we anticipated. However, we had enough opportunity to protect our Short positions, and even make a few pips – if we managed our trades properly.   
  
**On the Hourly chart** (attached), price, after hitting the fib 61.8% ret. level, reversed southward by over 30 pips to the 90.15 level (highlighted with the lower blue broken line). From a day-trade perspective, that gave us the opportunity to scale out a few pips, and also adjust our Stop Losses to break even – or, at least, a couple of pips above the point where price initially reversed @ 90.58 (not highlighted).

**On the Daily chart** (attached), we could observe that the bulls are shattering a number of resistance levels. The most recent of these levels was a resistance-confluence: the combination of a Daily swing high @ 1.6468 (which we've highlighted using the lower blue broken line), and the upper edge of the downward or bearish channel. This resistance level @ 1.6468 managed to hold the bulls throughout yesterday, which resulted in a reversal candle formation (doji). However, the doji only succeeded in creating a false signal as the bulls, by the early hours of today, ignored the doji and surged further. It’s noteworthy that this recent bulls’ move is not without a strong fundamental sentiment: the recent equity market gains have been encouraging risk-taking, which favors the euro, and other so-called higher-yielding currencies. However, the bulls still have a lot to prove to nullify the overall bearish sentiment.  
In all, from a day-trade perspective, we’ll still have to go with the bulls for now, until we start receiving contrary signals. The next critical resistance level is the most recent Weekly swing high @ 1.6741 (which we've highlighted using the upper blue broken line). The 1.6741 level is also acting as the area where we have both right and left shoulders of the Head & Shoulders formation; and that makes it a very significant level.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing high @ 1.6488 (which we've highlighted using the blue broken line) upward. That sustains our bias in favor of an upward price move. The green horizontal line @ 1.6327 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it - in the absence of any new and higher swing low - our bullish or upward bias remains intact.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts - using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels - to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows. Please note that our aim is to buy a dip in today's up-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), yesterday, we observed that the bulls were “shattering a number of resistance levels. The most recent of _the_ levels was a resistance-confluence: the combination of a Daily swing high @ 1.6468 (which we've highlighted using the lower blue broken line), and the upper edge of the downward or bearish channel. This observation is still valid and very useful. However, current price action compels us to exercise restraint in riding the bulls: earlier today, price hit the previous day’s high @ 1.6636 but was unable to hold above it; hence the bears are currently holding sway for today. We expect price to find support around the previous resistance-confluence @ 1.6468 (which should now act as a good support level). Our bias is still very bullish, but we would need further confirmation on the Hourly chart – supported by the H4 chart – to seek Long trade setups.   
As we also concluded yesterday, “the next critical resistance level is the most recent Weekly swing high @ 1.6741 (which we've highlighted using the upper blue broken line). The 1.6741 level is also acting as the area where we have both right and left shoulders of the Head & Shoulders formation; and that makes it a very significant level.”  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), similar to yesterday’s analysis, price broke the most recent swing high @ 1.6488 (which we've highlighted using the blue broken line) upward. That sustained our bias in favor of an upward price move. The 1.6488 level is another area where price could find support.  
The green horizontal line @ 1.6327 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it - in the absence of any new and higher swing low - our bullish or upward bias remains intact.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts - using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels - to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows. Please note that our aim is to buy a dip in today's up-trend.

Hello tunji and those following this thread,  
i personally have a system i use but your professional approach to trading really caught my attention. I didnt even demo trade....but jumped live due to your explicit explanation.  
Few questions pls:  
Do u have a fixed time for daily analysis? Pls address your ''today'' with respect to GMT as u are addressing the WORLD. This may help some newbies.  
When shud we be b4 our PC?........Curiously waiting for your analysis?!  
Confluence of event around current price action makes your system to have really high chances of winning trades .....but few or no such thing as ''overlapping fibs''. Mayb i need some clarification on that pls.  
And.....we may need the ''Items'' of this system posted or mention....so that we may chat together on this ''method'',but no problem if u decide to be the general boss. You make things easy for us!!!  
Thanks. Many are following out here and there!!!

Hello Goodwings, thanks for your kind words. First of all, please be careful about bypassing demo trading; and if you really feel you’re okay going straight to live trading, please don’t risk the money you sincerely don’t want to lose. It's already cliché, but it’s an “evergreen” rule guiding successful traders/investors.  
  
I really don’t have a specific time for the daily analyses. I usually post when I’ve settled down to trade for the day, which is often around early to mid London session. I would’ve loved to make it a fixed period, but, currently, I’m not in a position to promise that. And thanks for the suggestion on defining “Today,” I’ll see to it.  
  
I would agree that the frequency of trade setups based on the thread’s method, which requires overlapping fibs, is relatively low – but they occur (please check previous posts). Actually, I always like to reinforce my belief that we, as traders, have higher chances of having successful trading careers when we stick to methods that suit our individual personalities. While I believe the daily analyses are helpful to many traders, the thread’s method might suit only a few.  
  
If I interpreted this statement correctly: **“And.....we may need the ''Items'' of this system posted or mention....so that we may chat together on this ''method'', but no problem if u decide to be the general boss.”** The method is very much open to discussion.  
  
Thanks again Goodwings.

Dear tunji and my fellows,  
Tanx 4 your last reply.   
I used your system straight ahead because of its similarities with mine,infact yours ''swallowed'' mine. Being a day trader, i was saved by your method of entry,using fib ret to minimize my loses and sometimes increase my profit. Then comes your Analysis using the bigger picture(daily and 4hr) which explained to me why i was stopped out in trades in the past.  
Now, the ''items=tools=indicators'' are mostly Channels,R/Slines ,chart pattern,MACD and fibs. All of these items are automated and can be found on these thread so anyone interested can search.  
TO THE NEWBIES: The ''system'' is based on fibs but the''method'' of analysis, which is more important, is based on items listed above, just to increase chances of winning, making the market timer {u and me} making an educated risk on our invested capital. Our work in trading is to provide liquidity to the financial market....for profit....if....they appreciate it at the time we allow it to circulate. Thats the only reason that makes fx trading far and different from gambling but ''may'' have higher risk. Tanx.

****  
_Time of Posting – Fri. Oct. 23, 2009. 09:55 GMT_  
****  
**On the Daily chart** (attached), we would observe the bulls’ unrelenting move since the start of October. Though price, for a few days, has been struggling to break decisively above the upper edge of the upward or bullish channel, we are yet to have any convincing signal on the daily chart that the bulls are weak enough to buckle. Currently, price has broken yesterday’s high @ 1.5037: a sign of a possible continuous upward price movement. However, price rally has been relatively steep, and it’s just natural for this move to halt, at least temporarily, at a certain point. But from a day-trade perspective, as long as we believe in the strength of technical analysis, we have no choice but to keep our bias in favor of the bulls.   
And whenever price finally decides to have its bearish retracement, we expect a strong support around the most recent swing low @ 1.4827 (which we've highlighted using the blue broken line)  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached) price has breached the most recent swing high @ 1.5045 (which we've highlighted using the blue broken line) upward. That sustains our bias in favor of an upward price move. However, we would observe a reversal candle formation around the 1.5045 level; that’s another sign that the bulls might be experiencing difficulty maintaining their hold. Please let’s bear that in mind.  
The green horizontal line @ 1.4943 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it - in the absence of any new and higher swing low - our bullish or upward bias remains intact.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts - using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels - to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows. Please note that our aim is to buy a dip in today's up-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

Hello Bomi, sorry I couldn’t reply your post earlier. I’m not always in the market, so it would be difficult for me to offer my views every time – from a day-trade perspective. However, assuming you attached your chart(s), it would’ve been much easier to contribute to your market observations and activities.   
Please try to attach your chart(s) in subsequent posts as that would aid everyone – including myself – to have a proper understanding of your chart-based comments or questions. Thanks Bomi.

_Time of Posting – Mon. Oct. 26, 2009. 09:46 GMT_  
****  
**On the Weekly chart**(attached), the bears gave us a very strong sign that they aren’t just ready to let go: last week’s candle closed as a strong reversal candle (a hammer). Price closed @ 1.6303, just below a downward or bearish trend-line; it initially rallied toward the most recent Weekly swing high @ 1.6741 (which we've highlighted using the blue broken line) only to meet a strong resistance about 50 pips away from the critical 1.6741 level, and, as earlier said, it was eventually forced to close below the bearish trend-line. These actions tell us nothing else other than the fact that the bears are still in control.  
****  
**On the Daily chart** (attached), last week (precisely Wednesday and Thursday), while the bulls were flexing their muscles, we concluded that the 1.6741 level (that we've highlighted using the upper blue broken line), which we identified on the Weekly chart as the most recent Weekly swing high, was a “very significant level” as it is the area where we have both right and left shoulders of the Head & Shoulders formation. As we alluded to when analyzing the Weekly chart, the 1.6741 proved its strength: price was forced to reverse sharply as it advanced toward it, about 50 pips away from it – although from a day-trade perspective, we would have preferred that price advanced much further toward the 1.6741 level before the sharp reversal.  
Again, all current price actions are telling us is “think short!”  
The next area where we should expect a strong support is around the most recent Daily swing high @ 1.6119 (which we've highlighted using the lower blue broken line).  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price, decisively, broke the most recent swing low @ 1.6486 (which we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line) downward. That automatically shifted our bias in favor of a downward price move. The 1.6119 support level, which we discussed on the Daily chart, is also shown on the H4 chart (the lower blue broken line). Price is currently almost 200 pips from this support level; hence, we seem to have enough room to seek Short trades.  
The white horizontal line @ 1.6692 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.   
****  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

Goodwings, thanks for your kind words, and hope you – and everyone – had a restful weekend?   
  
Again, I would really have loved to post at specific periods, and discuss more currency pairs, but I’m also a trader, and that’s my primary focus. As a career market analyst, who unfortunately I’m not, I would definitely have had more time dedicated toward timely analysis of various currencies.  
If there’s the opportunity to do more, I’ll definitely try to as sharing my views not only helps others, but me too. And other FF members with instructive views are also welcomed to contribute – as long as contributions are within the context of the thread.  
Thanks Goodwings.

Thanks Dalla. Yes, the analysis is suitable for lower time frames. You’ll only need to do your overall top-down analysis properly.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), we concluded yesterday that trading bias was bearish, and our bias still stands. However, by the end of yesterday, we had a signal prompting us to be cautious about seeking Short trades for now: the previous day’s candle closed as a “doji.” A doji candle formation shows traders are currently indecisive about pushing price further downward. Yesterday’s low is @ 1.6249 (not highlighted). To be convinced of the bears’ readiness to push further today, we would like to see price break below this 1.6249 level.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price is yet to break the most recent swing low @ 1.6249 (that we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line), which also happens to be the previous day’s low discussed on the Daily chart. This isn’t a good sign supporting a bearish move. Again, as earlier said, “to be convinced of the bears’ readiness to push further today, we would like to see price break below this 1.6249 level.” The white horizontal line @ 1.6394 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.   
The 1.6119 support level (that we've highlighted using the lower blue broken line), which we’ve been discussing recently as the next area where we should expect a strong support is still valid – in case the bears decide to move today.  
****  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

Dear Dalla,  
Am not sure of your present level/experience as a Market Timer, but i personally cant imagine myself trading any currency bellow 1hr time frame(under normal condition though).  
As a newbie in the time past i was attracted to the lower time frame thinking that was the easiest and fast way of making it! But to cut the whole story short, if u are not taking fxtrading as a common game, please consider nothing less than 1hr. Am absolutely sure of a consistent profit 4 a newbie with a CENT account, a trading method and money management . She/he must not lose focus on the 4hr/daily/weekly time frame and especially on the the pivot points and/or the R/S levels of the stated time frames.  
But as i have said earlier, you may be above this level and may please leave this idea for the newbies. ''Scalping is good for the professionals and besides,THEY DO IT OCCASIONALLY''.   
Thank you for your question  
Thank you for bearing with me  
U and me are here to find comfort to our questioning minds for higher stability at making successful decision.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), earlier this week, price attempted to break decisively above a strong resistance-confluence of fib 38.2% ret. and the most recent Weekly swing low @ 91.71 (which we've highlighted using the upper blue broken line); however, current price action is telling us the level is holding after all. The previous day’s candle closed, as a bearish candle, around the 91.71 level; and further downward price movement earlier today is strengthening the notion that the bears are back in control. Our bias is currently bearish. The next critical support level, where we expect the bears’ resolve to be tested, is the most recent Daily swing low @ 90.06 (which we've highlighted using the lower blue broken line).  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing low @ 91.56 (which we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line) downward. That automatically shifts our bias in favor of a downward price move. The 90.06 support level, which we discussed on the Daily chart, is also shown on the H4 chart (the lower blue broken line). Price is currently more than 100 pips away from this support level; hence, we seem to have enough room to seek Short trades.  
The white horizontal line @ 92.17 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.   
****  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), yesterday, we decided to go with the bears; however, we identified the most recent Daily swing low @ 90.06 (which we've highlighted using the lower blue broken line) as the next critical support level where we expect the bears’ resolve to be tested. By the end of yesterday, price had travelled over 100 pips downward; and earlier today, it continued its southward move toward the critical 90.06 support. Currently, price has halted its downward move @ 90.23 – less than 20 pips away from 90.06. There’s a possibility we are already in the bulls’ zone: we might experience a strong or weak bullish retracement. In the case of weak retracement, we should still have the opportunity to seek Short trades today, but a strong retracement would most likely prevent any Short trade opportunity. In all, our bias is still bearish, but, depending on what price eventually tells us, from a day-trade perspective, we might have to exercise patience in seeking our Short trades, and that might mean not trading the USDJPY pair today.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), same as yesterday, the swing low @ 91.56 (which we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line) remains the most recent swing low that price broke below. That automatically sustains our bias in favor of a downward price move. As we could see, price moved downward, close to the 90.06 support level (the lower blue broken line) – leaving less than 20-pip gap in-between. Again, based on current price-bottom’s proximity to the 90.06 level, we might experience a strong or weak bullish retracement.   
The white horizontal line @ 92.17 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.   
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.

****  
**On the Daily chart** (attcahed), while our overall bearish bias is still valid, it’s been consistently challenged by the bulls. From a day-trade perspective, based on current price actions, we might have to temporarily ride the upward retracement. Since the beginning of this week, the bulls have been in charge, and at the close of yesterday, there was no sign their strength was waning. While our daily bias is bullish, we’ll need one more price action to be convinced of further bullish movement: we would like to see price break above the previous day’s high @ 1.6603 (not highlighted). In case the 1.6603 level eventually gets broken, we expect a very strong resistance @ 1.6692 (which we've highlighted using the upper blue broken line). The 1.6692 level is currently a resistance-confluence of the most recent Daily swing high and a bearish trend-line.   
  
**On the H4 chart**(attcahed), price had broken a previous most recent swing high @ 1.6466 (which we've highlighted using the lowest blue broken line) upward. That sustained our bias in favor of an upward price move.   
As discussed on the Daily chart, the 1.6603 level (that we've highlighted using the middle blue broken line), which is "acting" a dual role of the most recent H4 swing high as well as the previous day’s high, is a level we would like to see price break above for us to be convinced of further bullish movement.   
The 1.6692 level (the highest blue broken line), which we also discussed on the Daily chart, is shown on the H4 chart. We have about 90 pip-gap, between the 1.6603 and 1.6692 levels; hence, in case price eventually breaks above the 1.6603 level, we would, probably, still have enough room to seek Long trades – from a day-trade perspective.  
The green horizontal line @ 1.6336 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it - in the absence of any new and higher swing low - our bullish or upward bias remains intact.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts - using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels - to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows. Please note that our aim is to buy a dip in today's up-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

****  
**On the Daily chart** (attached), in line with higher time frame charts, our bias is currently bearish. Since the end of a bullish retracement early last week, price has realigned itself with the major bearish trend. However, the USDJPY pair – as well as the other majors – started this week with a “gap”: we had about a 50-pip gap between Friday’s close @ 90.07 and Monday’s open @ 89.56. It’s generally accepted that price usually moves to close a “gap” between the close and the open of a previous candle and a new candle, respectively; and as at the time of this analysis, price had done exactly that: it retraced upward from today’s open @ 89.56 to Friday’s close @ 90.07.   
Coincidentally, the 90.07 level aligns with the most recent Daily swing low @ 90.06 (which we've highlighted using the upper blue broken line). This might be a good resistance level to turn price southward – in line with our bias. In case price resumes its downward move, as we’re anticipating, we should expect a strong support around a Daily swing low @ 88.82 (which we've highlighted using the lower blue broken line).  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing low @ 90.83 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) downward. That automatically sustains our bias in favor of a downward price move. The white horizontal line @ 91.60 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.   
****  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

****  
**On the Daily chart** (attached), after a bullish retracement that lasted virtually throughout last week, price seems set to continue its southward journey. After completing an “inside candle” formation on Friday, and retracing upward, yesterday, to close up a “weekend gap” (a gap caused by the difference between Friday’s close @ 1.6455 and Monday’s open @ 1.6404), price ended up forming another “doji” candle by the end of yesterday, which suggested to us that traders, again, were battling with indecision. However, early price action today gave us an indication that the overall bearish bias is holding as price broke below yesterday’s low @ 1.6327 (not highlighted). However, the bears are not out of the woods yet: we have a strong support level – the most recent Daily swing low @ 1.6249 (which we've highlighted using the lower blue broken line). More conservative traders might prefer to see price break below this 1.6249 support before seeking any Hourly Short trade set-up.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing low – also yesterday’s low – @ 1.6327 (which we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line) downward. That automatically sustains our bias in favor of a downward price move. The 1.6249 strong support level (the lower blue broken line), which we discussed on the Daily chart, is shown on the H4 chart. Please let’s be conscious of this level.   
The white horizontal line @ 1.6476 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.   
****  
However, whether we decide to wait for the 1.6249 break or not, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

****  
**On the Daily chart** (attached), yesterday, while we held on to our bearish bias, the analysis was concluded with this statement: _“…the bears are not out of the woods yet: we have a strong support level – the most recent Daily swing low @ 1.6249…”_ Since yesterday, this support level @ 1.6249 (which we've highlighted using the lower blue broken line) has proved itself to be a very unyielding level: After price hit a low of 1.6261 yesterday, it sprang upward to close at a much higher price of 1.6419. Earlier today, price broke above the previous day’s high @ 1.6454 (not highlighted). These price actions are good enough to shift our bias – from a day-trade perspective – to bullish. However, apart from our overall bearish bias on the GBPUSD pair, the bulls might be having a daunting task of pushing further: a number of resistance levels must be broken, two of these levels are a downward or bearish trend-line (the red dashed line) and the most recent Daily swing high @ 1.6603 (which we've highlighted using the upper blue broken line). Personally, though our bias, from a day-trade perspective, has shifted to favor an upward move, the challenges the bulls are currently facing are enough to make more conservative traders refrain from seeking Long trades for now.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing high @ 1.6476 (which we've highlighted using the lower blue broken line) upward. That automatically shifts our bias in favor of an upward price move – from a day-trade perspective.   
A couple of resistance levels, which we discussed on the Daily chart as possible hurdles for further upward movement, are also shown on the H4 chart: a downward or bearish trend-line (the red dashed line) and the most recent Daily swing high @ 1.6603 (which we've highlighted using the upper blue broken line). Currently price is around the bearish trend-line, hence there’s a possibility the bulls are already in a “danger” zone.   
Again, strictly based on our primary parameters, our current bias is bullish; but the challenges the bulls are facing, as earlier said, are enough to make more conservative traders refrain from seeking Long trades for now.  
The green horizontal line @ 1.6261 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it - in the absence of any new and higher swing low - our bullish or upward bias remains intact.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts - using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels - to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows. Please note that our aim is to buy a dip in today's up-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

Pls NOTE: We now have a possible Long trade set-up, however, as we concluded earlier today, conservative traders should refrain from taking this trade, or at least reduce their risk.  
  
**The Hourly chart**(attached) is currently forming a tradable pattern. Price seems to have topped temporarily @ 1.6543. Hence, we expect price to retrace to the area between 1.6471 and 1.6399 (which is the area between the 50% and 100% fib. retracement levels – drawn from the most recent Hourly swing low to the current price-top). Let’s seek to buy around this area. If price breaks the 1.6399 level downward, our bullish bias is no more valid and we enter a no-trading zone. Our primary profit target is @ 1.6582 (the 127% fib. ext.).  
  
Also, if price breaks above 1.6543 (current price-top) before retracing to the buy-area, we’ll have to redraw our Fibonacci tools using a new top & the most recent Hourly swing low to determine new potential areas to buy.  
  
**The 15min. chart**(attached) gives us a clearer view of the Hourly price action and the potential areas to buy (please note it’s advisable to set a Limit order ahead of time as price could move down to these levels and reverse sharply in our favor)  
This chart is rather cluttered but if we look closely, there is a particular potential reversal level available:   
  
fib 78.6% ret. @ 1.6430.   
  
Personally, I consider this 78.6% level a potentially strong reversal level based on the broken most-recent Hourly swing high @ 1.6435.   
  
Initial Stop Loss @ 1.6397; primary Profit target @ 1.6580 (Please remember to factor in your broker’s pip-spread).  
  
Please note that this Fibonacci (fib.) level also has a Weekly pivot, an overlapping fib supporting it.  
  
Please keep your risk low. Don’t risk more than 2% of your capital. Personally, I risk about 0.5% per trade; and each trade has a potential profit target of 1% or more – based on my exit levels.  
We MUST NEVER assume we KNOW where price is going next!  
  
P.S.:   
Always keep in mind any major news releases. Be wary of possible price volatility during these periods.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), since the beginning of November, the USDJPY currency pair, as well as other major pairs, seems to have been consolidating. This indicates that investors and traders are currently indecisive as to which currencies to support or dump. From a fundamental perspective, this action is most likely not unconnected to series of important reports being released in Europe and the US this week.   
We would notice on the USDJPY Daily chart that price is currently within a symmetrical triangle. While our bias is still heavily in favor of a downtrend, we would like to see price break below certain support levels: the first would be the lower edge of the symmetrical triangle, and the second, the most recent Daily swing low @ 89.43 (which we've highlighted using the blue broken line). Again, our bias remains bearish, but, currently, the coast isn’t just clear enough for us to seek Short trade set-ups.   
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), currently buttressing our view that the pair is in an indecisive mode is price’s reaction around the most recent swing low @ 90.04 (which we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line): although the 90.04 level has been breached, we could notice price is struggling to stay below it as the last fully formed candle not only closed well above it, but also closed as a reversal candle.  
One of the critical support level discussed on the Daily chart - the most recent Daily swing low @ 89.43 (which we've highlighted using the lower blue broken line) is also shown on the H4 chart.   
As earlier said, our bias remains bearish, but, currently, the coast isn’t clear enough for us to seek Hourly Short trade set-ups.   
The white horizontal line @ 91.30 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.   
****  
However, in case the coast eventually gets clearer, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows.

**Pls NOTE:** Again, if there’s one particular day in every month that trending method/pattern traders should be wary of trading most, it has to be the first Fridays of every month when the Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) report is usually released.  
While I’ll go ahead to give my personal analysis on the USDJPY pair, please, let’s bear in mind that, regardless of any technical analyses, NFP usually rules today.  
****  
**On the Daily chart** (attcahed), as discussed yesterday, since the beginning of November, the USDJPY currency pair (as well as other major pairs) has been consolidating. Price is still within the symmetrical triangle we identified. Again, while our bias is still in favor of a downtrend, we still hold on to the opinion that we would like to see price break below certain support levels to convince us of the bears readiness to resume their activities: the first of the support levels is the lower edge of the symmetrical triangle, and the second is the most recent Daily swing low @ 89.43 (which we've highlighted using the blue broken line). As concluded earlier, our bias remains bearish, but, currently, the coast isn’t just clear enough for us to seek Short trade set-ups.   
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price action – much more than yesterday’s – is buttressing our view that the pair is currently in an indecisive mode. In addition to the symmetrical triangle identified on the Daily chart, we could identify a similar formation on the H4 chart. Furthermore, price is stuck between the most recent swing high @ 91.30 (which we've highlighted using the white horizontal line) and the most recent swing low @ 89.98 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line). These price actions are simply telling us to stay away from this pair for now.   
Personally, this is a very good example of how technical and fundamental analyses can complement each other. For today, the coast isn’t just clear enough for us (as trend traders) to seek any trade set-ups – at least from a day-trade perspective.

**On the Daily chart** (attcahed), things aren’t looking good in any way for the bears. In August, this year, based on higher time frame charts (Monthly and Weekly charts), the bears gave a strong signal that they were taking over from the bulls, however, recent price actions are giving grave signs that the bears might have to remain “subservient” for a longer period. Virtually throughout last month, October, we were discussing the critical resistance level @ 1.6741 (which we've highlighted using the lower blue broken line) where we have both right and left shoulders of the Head & Shoulders formation. We concluded that price break above the 1.6741 level would signal a strong possibility of bulls pushing farther. Earlier today, this 1.6741 level was breached; hence our longer term bearish bias is floundering.   
However, there remains the last barrier that price must break above to completely nullify our overall bearish bias: the 1.7041 resistance level (which we've highlighted using the upper blue broken line) where we have the “head” of the Head & Shoulders formation, as well as the most recent Monthly chart swing high. Price is still a couple of hundred pips away from this critical resistance level; hence, in all, from a day-trade perspective, our bias is bullish.   
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing high @ 1.6634 (which we've highlighted using the blue broken line) upward. That sustains our bias in favor of an upward price move.   
The green horizontal line @ 1.6516 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it - in the absence of any new and higher swing low - our bullish or upward bias remains intact.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts - using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels - to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows. Please note that our aim is to buy a dip in today's up-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), we would observe the EURUSD currency pair has been trending upward for a number of days now. From a day-trade perspective, that’s a clear sign that our bias should remain bullish. However, price is currently in a situation where we would like to see further confirmation that the bulls are ready to push higher: price is yet to breach the previous day’s high @ 1.5019 (not highlighted). In addition, the bulls’ advance is getting very close to a critical resistance level – the year-high as well as the most recent Daily swing high @ 1.5061 (that we've highlighted using the upper blue broken line) – which is less than a hundred pips away. While our bias is in favor of an upward price move, the coast isn’t too clear; hence, let’s be very cautious in case we decide to seek Long trade setups.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken a recent swing high @ 1.4917 (which we've highlighted using the lowest blue broken line) upward. That sustains our bias in favor of an upward price move.   
The previous day’s high @ 1.5019 (that we've highlighted using the middle blue broken line), which we discussed earlier on the daily chart as a resistance level we would like to see price break above, is seen on the H4 chart as the most recent swing high. The very critical resistance level – the year-high @ 1.5061 (that we've highlighted using the uppermost blue broken line), which is also discussed on the Daily chart, is highlighted.   
Again, though our bias is in favor of an upward price move, the coast isn’t too clear. We’ve got only about 40-pip gap between the previous day’s high @ 1.5019 and the year-high @ 1.5061; therefore, even if price eventually strengthens our bullish bias by breaking above the previous day’s high, by that time, price would’ve moved much closer to the yeah-high level – an area that could easily be considered as the bears’ zone.  
It’s probably better to stay away from this pair for now; but, as earlier said, in case we decide to seek Hourly Long trade setups, let’s be very cautious.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), yesterday, we concluded that the EURUSD currency pair has been trending upward for a number of days, which translated to a continuous bullish bias, but was in a situation where we would like to see further confirmation that the bulls were ready to push higher. We are still, more or less, of the same view: little price action has happened since yesterday, but nevertheless, early price action today is good enough to warrant further review.   
Price has broken above the previous day’s high @ 1.5020 (not highlighted) – almost same as penultimate day’s high @ 1.5019. That signals the possibility of further bullish movement. However, as also discussed yesterday, the bulls’ advance is getting critically close to a critical resistance level – the year-high, as well as the most recent Daily swing high @ 1.5061 (that we've highlighted using the upper blue broken line) – which is now less than 40 pips away. While our bias is in favor of an upward price move, the coast isn’t too clear; hence, let’s be very cautious.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attcahed), price has broken the most recent swing high – also the previous day’s high @ 1.5020 (which we've highlighted using the lower blue broken line) upward. That sustains our bias in favor of an upward price move.   
The very critical resistance level – the year-high @ 1.5061 (that we've highlighted using the upper blue broken line), which we’ve been discussing since yesterday, is highlighted on the H4 chart. Again, similar to yesterday, though our bias is in favor of an upward price move, the coast isn’t clear. We’ve got only about 40-pip gap between the just broken most recent swing high – the previous day’s high @ 1.5020 and the year-high @ 1.5061; therefore, even though price-break above the 1.5020 level strengthens our bullish bias, price is now gravely close to the yeah-high level – an area that could easily be considered as the bears’ zone. It’s probably better to stay away from this pair for now till the coast is clearer.  
However, let’s keep in mind that the green horizontal line @ 1.4937 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it - in the absence of any new and higher swing low - our bullish or upward bias remains intact.

_Please NOTE that this analysis is rather late; hence, it’s best suitable for late London and New York Sessions traders._  
****  
**On the Daily chart** (attached), yesterday, further price-move upward was rejected within the “bears’ zone” (that we been discussing since Tuesday, this week); precisely 14 pips away from the critical resistance level – the year-high, as well as the most recent Daily swing high @ 1.5061 (which we've highlighted using the upper blue broken line). As a result, price ended with a reversal candle formation (a hammer) – a relatively strong indication that the 1.5061 would be holding and the bears would be taking over, at least temporarily.   
Earlier today, price action further confirmed the strength of the “bears’ zone” as price broke below the previous day’s low @ 1.4952 (not highlighted). For now, from a day trade perspective, our bias has turned bearish. The next critical support area is the lower edge of the upward or bullish channel, which is roughly 200 pips away from current price position; hence we seem to have enough room to seek Short trades on this currency pair.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing low @ 1.4952 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) downward. That automatically shifts our bias in favor of a downward price move. The white horizontal line @ 1.5047 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.   
****  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), yesterday, as we anticipated, price continued its downward move and ended as a strong bearish candle. We expect further bearish movement today; however, we would like to see price break below the previous day’s low @ 1.4820 (not highlighted) to be more convinced of the bears’ resolve. If the bears succeed in breaching the 1.4820 level, then, we would still have the lower edge of the bullish channel as the next critical support area, which is currently more than 100 pips away from current price position; hence, from a day trade perspective, we seem to still have enough room to seek further Short trade setups on the Hourly chart.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), also yesterday, price broke a recent swing low @ 1.4952 (which we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line) downward. That automatically shifted our bias in favor of a downward price move. However, as we discussed earlier on the Daily chart, the previous day’s low @ 1.4820, which is seen on the H4 chart as the most recent swing low (highlighted with the lower blue broken line), is a support level we would like to see price break below before we seek Hourly setups.  
The white horizontal line @ 1.5047 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.   
****  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions.

Jeff, nice to see your post; actually, there wasn’t any swing high broken on my H4 chart earlier today (at times, H4 chart price actions could vary based on trading platforms). On my chart, the white horizontal line @ 1.6800 (shown on the attached H4 chart) has been the most recent swing high for a couple of days now, and price is still relatively far from breaking above it. The Daily chart, too, isn’t really in favor of a bullish move because of certain resistance levels.   
I see the current upward move as a bullish retracement. If the method you employ supports a Long trade, please trade it with caution. To me, from a day-trade perspective, that’ll be counter-trend trade. Also, today is Friday, the last trading day for the week. Price movement might get very subdued a few hours from now.  
  
To attach charts, you’ll have to click the “attachments” tab located on the “Message” window where you write your messages before posting them. Hope my explanation is clear?   
  
I wish you and everybody a restful weekend.

Hi Tunji,  
Thanks for your response to my post. Candle “A” as shown on your chart and mine below isn’t a swing high? Please kindly explain.  
Below are the details of all I did, please (Tunji and everyone) throw caution to the wind and feel free to comment and positively criticize…I want to learn. This thread has saved my trading career and I’m willing to learn more.  
Chart 1 – My H4 TF view  
Chart 2 – H1 view showing my “supposed” swing high  
Chart 3 – I drew my fib. Supposing the PA had reached a point to retrace  
Chart 4 – Price retraced to my fib61.8,38.2, and two supports. I took the trade mechanically after the forceful bounce.   
Chart 5 – I monitored closely at M1 ‘cos things were really slow and late on Friday. I took a palsy 22 pips profit from the table and closed for the day!! (LOL?)  
Chart 6 – The PA as at today almost reached the fib.127ext.  
Thanks!!!  
  
_P.S_  
Well my charts are showing correctly in my preview, I hope it does when I submit finally.

****  
**On the Daily chart** (attached), we would notice that the longer term bearish trend is pretty much obvious, and it’s even more noticeable on the Weekly and Monthly charts. Satisfyingly, from a day trade perspective, our bias is leaning toward the longer term trend: price pattern has been forming lower highs. However, the lower lows haven’t been as distinct as the bears seem to be struggling to break decisively below the support area around the most recent Daily swing low @ 89.29 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line). Price action between the minor downward or bearish trend-line (the red dashed line) and the 89.29 level seems to be forming a “descending triangle” formation. A descending triangle formation gives us an idea that traders are currently indecisive whether to push further downward or not. As a result, though our bias, from a day-trade perspective, is bearish, we would like to see price break below (or, preferably, close below) the 89.29 level to be further convinced of the bears’ strength.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), late last week, price broke below the most recent swing low @ 89.63 (which we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line). That automatically shifted our bias in favor of a downward price move. However, to buttress our observation on the Daily chart, we would notice price is struggling to close decisively below the most recent swing low: after the initial breach of the 89.63 level, subsequent candles’ opens and closes are seen to be clinging” to the level.   
The 89.29 level (which we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line) – as well as the bearish trend-line – discussed on the Daily chart is also seen on the H4 chart, and it gives us a clearer view of price’s proximity to the level. Again, though our bias, from a day-trade perspective, is bearish, we would like to see price break below this 89.29 level to be further convinced of the bears’ strength.   
The white horizontal line @ 90.60 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.   
****  
However, once the coast is clear, we’ll still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

Jeff, I must admit you had a detailed work going on those charts – and that’s throwing caution to the wind![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
· Regarding how I determine a swing high, the candle in question must have two lower candles on either side. The candle “A” you highlighted has only one lower candle on its left side. You can easily identify these swing highs/lows by using the “Fractal” indicator on MT4 platform (I think you use MT4?).  
· On chart 2: The swing high you used on the H1 chart wasn’t the most recent swing high, but, nonetheless, it was a potential reversal level. As I usually say, though this thread’s Daily & H4 analyses complement many day-trading methods, the particular method discussed on the thread only uses the most recent Hourly swing highs/lows, but, again, it doesn’t mean other swing points don’t work. The point is for us to stick with the pattern we’re most comfortable with, and discipline ourselves to ward off distractions.  
· On chart 3: It’s ok drawing your fib anytime you feel price is ready to retrace.   
· On chart 4: Your entry (including the trade setup parameters) is simply nice based on my estimation.  
· On chart 5: Monitoring your trades on lower time frame charts (15min and 5min) is very necessary; but, personally, price action on the 1min chart is very fickle (giving lots of fake signals as a result), so I tend to avoid it.   
Pls NOTE: it’s very important to keep in mind the minimum reward/risk you intend to achieve in a given trade when you’re scaling out your profits. For instance, if your reward/risk ratio target is 2:1, and you’re risking 40 pips on a trade, then you must ensure you scale out your profits in a way that your overall pip-profit potential will not be less than 80 pips. I hope that doesn’t sound too confusing?  
· On chart 6: I would say the “counter-trend” trade worked. The main thing to know is we can’t always accurately predict the market, but we can always accurately predict what we’ll do when our methods work for us or against us.  
  
Sorry for the lengthy response.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), since early this month, price actions have been showing grave signs that the end of longer term bears’ reign is imminent. Early last week, the bears attempted to start regaining lost ground, however, recent price actions showed their efforts were futile: On Monday, last week, price broke above, at that time, the very critical resistance level @ 1.6741 (which we've highlighted using the lowest blue broken line), but couldn’t stay above the level as it met heavy resistance pressure. The bulls, however, showed their resolve as they resumed the upward push by the end of last week. Currently, price has decisively closed above the 1.6741 level, and has also breached the most recent Daily swing high @ 1.6842 (which we've highlighted using the middle blue broken line). Price pattern is now beginning to show a more visible higher-high-higher-low formation. These price actions, combined with some fundamental reports including the Federal Reserve Chairman’s speech yesterday, are strong signs supporting the bulls.  
However, after all’s said and done, as emphasized last week, there remains the last barrier that price must break above to completely nullify our overall bearish bias: the 1.7041 resistance level (which we've highlighted using the uppermost blue broken line) where we have the “head” of, at the moment, the very weak Head & Shoulders formation, the year-high, as well as the most recent Monthly chart swing high. While, from a day-trade perspective, our bias is currently bullish, let’s bear in mind that we’re still relatively within the bears’ zone.  
Please NOTE that it would be preferable to see price break above the previous day’s high @ 1.6877 (not highlighted) before seeking any Long trade setup today,   
  
**On the H4 chart**(attcahed), price has broken the previous most recent swing high @ 1.6799 (which we've highlighted using the lower blue broken line) upward. That shifts our bias in favor of an upward price move. The previous day’s high @ 1.6877 (that we've highlighted using the upper blue broken line), which we discussed on the Daily chart, is seen on the H4 chart as the most recent swing high. Again, before we seek Hourly Long trade setups, we would prefer to see this level broken.   
The green horizontal line @ 1.6668 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it - in the absence of any new and higher swing low - our bullish or upward bias remains intact.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts - using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels - to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows. Please note that our aim is to buy a dip in today's up-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

****  
**On the Daily chart** (attcahed), on Wednesday last week, the bulls, seeking to make a new year-high, met fierce resistance less than 20 pips below the current year-high and, at that time, the most recent Daily swing high @ 1.5061 (which we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line). As a result, price reversed at 1.5047, formed a reversal candle – Doji (pointed out by the right green arrow), moved further downward, and eventually resulted in the formation of the most recent Daily swing high @ the 1.5047 level. This price action created a potential “double top” formation – the “first top” (pointed out by the left green arrow) being the year-high @ 1.5061, and the “second top” (pointed out by the right green arrow) being the most recent Daily swing high @ 1.5047. A Double Top in a strong bullish trend signifies a possible, major bearish move.  
Although, the potential Double Top, by itself, isn’t strong enough to nullify the longer term bullish bias (as further bearish actions are still necessary), from a day-trade perspective, it supports a day-trade bearish bias, which was “instigated” by a recent price action: before the close of yesterday’s candle, price breached the most recent Daily swing low @ 1.4820 (which we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line) – a good sign that the bears want to push further downward. However, though, from a day-trade perspective, our bias is bearish, we would like price to break below previous day’s low @ 1.4807 (not highlighted). Price is currently a considerable distance away from breaking this 1.4807 support, hence, we might have to exercise patience throughout today on this pair.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), earlier, price broke a recent swing low @ 1.4879 (which we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line) downward. That automatically shifted our bias in favor of a downward price move. However, in relation to our bearish bias, price is currently in a bullish retracement, and, consequently, as discussed on the Daily chart, it is a considerable distance away from breaking the earlier mentioned previous day’s low @ 1.4807 (that we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line), which is seen on the H4 chart as the most recent swing low. Again, in seeking Hourly Short trades, we might have to exercise patience, possibly throughout today, on this pair.  
The white horizontal line @ 1.5015 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.

_**"Sorry for the lengthy response"**_  
Tunji thanks so much for your response,please keep the "the lengthy" responses coming,I am deeply grateful to you for them.  
  
Meanwhile,I spotted thie EURUSD since yesterday and was glad that a good one could be coming and was poised for a possible take at the overlap of fib61.8 and weekly pivot as shown on my chart attached,then came so timely your post with the caution _**"However, though, from a day-trade perspective, our bias is bearish, we would like price to break below previous day’s low @ 1.4807 (not highlighted)."**_ It saved me. Please I will be glad if you can kindly explain the reason(s) behind the caution so that I and other learning folks like me can file it against next similar situation?  
Thanks alot Tunji!!!

You’re very much welcome Jeff. From my understanding – using a Short trade scenario as an example – traders usually use the lowest price a given currency pair, etc. reached the previous day to determine whether other traders are ready to continue selling today. If the other traders show the willingness to keep on selling by pushing price below the previous day’s low (or the previous day’s lowest price), then one gets more convinced that price might move further downward; so, waiting for price to break previous days’ highs or lows before attempting to go Long or Short, respectively, is a good way to gauge the market’s (or other traders’) sentiment.  
However, as with other observations in the market, it doesn’t ALWAYS work that way.

****  
**On the Daily chart** (attached), though it’s pretty much obvious that we’re now within a medium term bullish trend, current price actions show we probably have the opportunity to seek Short trades – from a day-trade perspective. Earlier this week, price moved upward to breach, at that time, the most recent swing high @ 1.6842 (which we’ve highlighted using the middle blue broken line) but was unable to stay above it; consequently, it started retracing downward since then. The previous day’s low @ 1.6714 (not highlighted) has been broken downward and that strengthens our day-trade bearish bias. However, price is currently at the lower edge of an upward or bullish channel, and that tells us to be very cautious of Short trades. In case the bears decide to disregard the channel’s lower edge, we expect the most recent Daily swing low @ 1.6514 (which we’ve highlighted using the lowest blue broken line) to act as the next crucial support level. In all, from a day-trade perspective, our bias is bearish; but let’s keep in mind that we are still within a medium term bullish trend.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing low @ 1.6754 (which we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line) downward. That automatically shifts our bias in favor of a downward price move. The bullish channel discussed on the Daily chart is shown on the H4 chart and it gives us a clearer observation of price action around it. We would observe it’s currently stalling further bearish move. The next crucial support level @ 1.6514 (that we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line), which we also discussed on the Daily chart, is also seen on the H4 chart – over 150 pips from current price position.  
Depending on individuals’ risk-tolerance level, we might handle the current situation in a couple of ways: either we immediately start seeking Short trade setups, or we wait for an H4 candle to close decisively below the bullish channel. Whatever we decide, again, let’s keep in mind that we are still within a medium term bullish trend.  
The white horizontal line @ 1.6845 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.   
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

With support of the Daily and H4 charts, we currently have a possible Long trade setup on the USDCHF pair.  
  
Pls NOTE: **On the H4 chart** (attached), while setting our profit targets and managing our Long trades, let’s keep in mind the most recent swing high @ 1.0208 (highlighted with the blue broken line). It might prove to be a crucial resistance.  
  
**The Hourly chart**(attached) is currently forming a tradable pattern. Price seems to have topped temporarily @ 1.0194. Hence, we expect price to retrace to the area between 1.0158 and 1.0122 (which is the area between the 50% and 100% fib. retracement levels – drawn from the most recent Hourly swing low to the current price-top). Let’s seek to buy around this area. If price breaks the 1.0122 level downward, our bullish bias is no more valid and we enter a no-trading zone. Our primary profit target is @ 1.0214 (the 127% fib. ext.).  
  
Also, if price breaks above 1.0194 (current price-top) before retracing to the buy-area, we’ll have to redraw our Fibonacci tools using a new top & the most recent Hourly swing low to determine new potential areas to buy.  
  
**The 15min. chart**(attached) gives us a clearer view of the Hourly price action and the potential areas to buy (please note it’s advisable to set a Limit order ahead of time as price could move down to these level and reverse sharply in our favor)  
This chart is rather cluttered but if we look closely, there are a couple of potential reversal levels available. You choose your preferred level based on your personality.  
  
fib 61.8% ret. @ 1.0150;   
fib 78.6% ret. @ 1.0138.   
  
Personally, based on the broken most-recent Hourly swing high @ 1.0140, which I believe is a potentially strong reversal level, I would be going for the 78.6% ret.   
  
Initial Stop Loss @ 1.0120; primary Profit target @ 1.0212 (Please remember to factor in your broker’s pip-spread).  
  
Please note that all these Fibonacci (fib.) levels have other pivots, overlapping fibs or previous highs/lows supporting them (they are the cause of this cluttered chart). As such, price could reverse at any of the points. The issue here is that the deeper the fib level you choose to buy from, the smaller the pips you’ll risk and the more your pip-profit; BUT, also the more the likelihood of you missing the trade as price might not retrace that deep before moving back upward.  
You need your own discretion here.  
  
Please keep your risk low. Don’t risk more than 2% of your capital. Personally, I risk about 0.5% per trade; and each trade has a potential profit target of 1% or more – based on my entry & exit levels.  
We MUST NEVER assume we KNOW where price is going next!  
  
P.S.:   
Similar Short trade set-up is forming on the EURUSD pair.  
Also, always keep in mind any major news releases. Be wary of possible price volatility during these periods.

Hi Tunji,  
Referring to my H1 chart,  
1) Do u think setup 'A' is viable to take? The bearish retracement stopped almost right at 78.6.  
2) Is the taken out of yesterday's high makes you validate yr H1 setup?  
3) I think wave 'B' is shy of reaching top of 'A' and hence prices ranging or sell off would be more likely. 1.02...area is really a hurdle.  
  
Just to share....my thought.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Thanks.

I love using Fibonacci in my trades. But I only use in on the 4H and Daily charts. Forex trading becomes so simple once you get the hang of it. Although I'm not saying that it's going to be easy. But Fibonacci gives you a clearer picture of what is happening in the markets.  
  
I'm glad I found this thread. Will post my trades using Fibonacci soon.

Nice observations Allan.   
· Based on this thread’s method, setup ‘A’ isn’t viable. The primary fib for a Long trade is always drawn from the most recent Hourly swing low, and that wasn’t the most recent swing low at that time (sorry I don’t know how to paste text on your images. I’ll be glad if you or anyone could explain it to me).   
· Price-break above yesterday’s high supported the Long trade, but wasn’t the only reason.  
· Regarding the ‘A’ high in relation to ‘B’, you’re correct: it is a hurdle; and you would notice I referred to that in the “Long USDCHF setup” post.   
However, my personal opinion of the market is that you won’t always have all indicators and price actions giving you the green light, so you just have to trade your method while putting into consideration other contrary indications when managing the trade.

****  
**On the Daily chart** (attached), we concluded yesterday that “though… we’re now within a medium term bullish trend, current price actions show we probably have the opportunity to seek Short trades – from a day-trade perspective.” Today, our day-trade bias still remains bearish. Yesterday’s candle closed decisively below the lower edge of the upward or bullish channel – a good sign the bears still have momentum. However, before seeking our Hourly Short trade setups – supported by the H4 chart – we would like to see price break below yesterday’s low @ 1.6605 (not highlighted) to be further convinced of the bears’ strength.   
As we also concluded earlier, we expect the most recent Daily swing low @ 1.6514 (which we’ve highlighted using the lowest blue broken line) to act as the next crucial support level.   
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price broke, at that time, the most recent swing low @ 1.6754 (which we’ve highlighted using the uppermost blue broken line) downward. That automatically shifted our bias in favor of a downward price move. We could observe price’s proximity to previous day’s low – also the most recent swing low @ 1.6605 (that we’ve highlighted using the middle blue broken line), which we discussed on the Daily chart as a support level we would like price to break below before seeking Hourly Short trades. We could also observe the crucial support level @ 1.6514 (that we’ve highlighted using the lowest blue broken line), which we also discussed on the Daily chart. We have about 90-pip gap between the 1.6605 and 1.6514 levels; hence, we seem to have enough room to short this pair – in case price eventually breaks below the 1.6605 level.  
The white horizontal line @ 1.6845 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.   
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

****  
**On the Daily chart** (attached), last week, we correctly anticipated further bearish movement on the GBPUSD pair. Also in accordance with our analysis, price found support around the most recent Daily swing low @ 1.6514 (which we’ve highlighted using the middle blue broken line). While our bias still remains bearish primarily due to the fact that price breached the 1.6514 level, the last trading day’s candle – last week Friday’s candle – did not decisively close below it, hence we still need further confirmation that the bears still have momentum. We would like to see price break below previous trading day’s low – Friday’s low – @ 1.6459 (not highlighted). From a day-trade perspective, we would interpret current price action as a bullish retracement; hence we might have to exercise patience in seeking day-trade selling opportunities. If price eventually breaks below Friday’s low @ 1.6459, we expect the next Daily swing low @ 1.6261 (which we’ve highlighted using the lowest blue broken line) to act as the new crucial support level.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attcahed), price broke, at that time, the most recent swing low @ 1.6605 (which we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line) downward. That automatically sustained our bias in favor of a downward price move. As discussed on the Daily chart, Friday’s low @ 1.6459 (that we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line), which is seen on the H4 chart as the most recent swing low, is a level we would like to see price break below to confirm further bearish movement. Again, from a day-trade perspective, price seems to be in a bullish retracement, and as a result, it’s currently a considerable distance away from the 1.6459 level we would like to see it break below. We might have to exercise patience in seeking day-trade selling opportunities.   
The white horizontal line @ 1.6674 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.   
  
However, once the coast is clear, we’ll still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

****  
**On the Daily chart** (attached), we would observe that since two weeks ago – precisely Wednesday 11 – when price peaked @ 1.5047 to form the “second top” of a possible Double Top formation (pointed out by the right green arrow), price has been in a consolidation pattern – within a narrow downward or bearish channel formation. At the time the consolidation started, similar to most of life situations, we didn’t have enough information to know it had started, as that would have aided our decisions. It’s during periods like this that individuals crave the sixth sense to see into the future. However, in the absence of sixth sense, we’ll always make do with what is readily at our disposal: the real-time information.   
Current price action is telling us that the market is in a consolidation mode, hence, from a day-trade perspective, it’s probably advisable to keep off any trending method till we have a clearer coast. We would be waiting for price to break decisively above or below the bearish channel to make further decisions. We don’t know when that would happen, it may or may not happen today; we just have to wait.   
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing high @ 1.4934 (which we've highlighted using the blue broken line) upward. That sustains our bias in favor of an upward price move. However, as we’ve discussed at length on the Daily chart, current bigger picture isn’t supporting any strong bullish movement for now, hence, regardless of the H4 swing break, it’s preferable to keep off any day-trade trending methods for now.   
Although, the coast is not clear at the moment, let’s keep in mind that the green horizontal line @ 1.4800 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it - in the absence of any new and higher swing low - our bullish or upward bias remains intact.

****  
**On the Daily chart** (attached), earlier price action today resulted in a decisive break above the downward or bearish channel, which we discussed yesterday. Not only that, the bulls also shattered two critical resistance levels: the most recent Daily swing high @ 1.5047, a level which had been acting as the “second top” of a previously anticipated – i.e. now nullified – Double Top formation (pointed out by the right green arrow), and the year-high @ 1.5061 (which we've highlighted using the blue broken line). Both are just a few pips apart from each other.  
Hence, from a day-trade perspective (and even a longer term perspective), our bias is now bullish. There seems to be no major resistance level the bulls have to contend with for now, so we expect a relatively “smooth” uptrend for the time being.   
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing high @ 1.4987 (which we've highlighted using the lowest blue broken line) upward. That sustains our bias in favor of an upward price move. Also, as we discussed on the Daily chart, the crucial resistance levels: the most recent Daily swing high @ 1.5047 and the year-high @ 1.5061 (which we've highlighted using the middle and uppermost blue broken lines, respectively) have also been broken; and that greatly strengthens our bullish bias. However, let’s keep in mind that price has moved a considerable distance today, so movement might stall for a while. The green horizontal line @ 1.4887 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it - in the absence of any new and higher swing low - our bullish or upward bias remains intact.  
  
However, when seeking our Long trades, we’ll still need our Hourly charts - using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels - to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows. Please note that our aim is to buy a dip in an up-trend.

Hey guys,  
I think GbpUsd has probably formed a wider bullish channel comparatively. With a higher swing high in H4, bullish bias should be observed. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Lefteye, I agree with your view; and it would be pleasing to see price break above yesterday’s high @ 1.6744.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), yesterday, we witnessed price making a new year-high @ 1.5143 (not highlighted). Price broke two previous critical resistance levels: the most recent Daily swing high @ 1.5047 (also not highlighted) and the previous year-high @ 1.5061 (which we've highlighted using the blue broken line). Those price actions were strong enough to sustain our day-trade bullish bias and shift our longer term bias to supporting an uptrend scenario. Currently, price is probably having a bearish retracement. It is, at the moment, around the previous year-high level @ 1.5061, which we expect to now act as a good support level. If the current retracement is shallow, the 1.5061 level might help the bulls resume their movement. The main thing we’re interested in is when we would be prompted to continue seeking Long trade setups on our Hourly charts – supported by H4 chart; hence, we would like to see price break above the year-high – also the previous day’s high @ the 1.5143 level.  
  
Please NOTE: Let’s keep in mind that today is Thanksgiving holiday in the US, so we might experience thin trading volume, especially during the New York session.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), the previously broken swing high @ 1.4987 (which we've highlighted using the lowest blue broken line) still remains the most recent swing high price broke above. That sustains our bias in favor of an upward price move. The previous year-high @ 1.5061 (that we've highlighted using the middle blue broken line), which we discussed on the Daily chart as a level we expect to now act as a good support level – if the current retracement is shallow – is seen on the H4 chart.  
The new year-high – also the previous day’s high @ 1.5143 (which we've highlighted using the uppermost blue broken line) is seen as the most recent swing high on the H4 chart. Again, as earlier discussed, we would like to see price break above this level before seeking Long trade setups.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts - using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels - to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows. Please note that our aim is to buy a dip in today's up-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

****  
**On the Weekly chart** (attached), we have a clearer picture of the overall market activity. Although, from the Weekly chart’s perspective, it’s currently a bit premature to conclude, we would notice that a possible downward or bearish channel is unfolding. This is indirectly (or directly, as the case may be) telling us that, while the Head and Shoulders formation previously observed on the Daily chart has been virtually nullified, the bears might still manage to pull something out of the bag.  
****  
**On the Daily chart** (attached), the downward or bearish channel is seen to be more valid as, unlike the weekly chart, the swing points for drawing the channel are already fully formed. Also to be observed is the current price pattern of lower high and lower low – a very strong indication that the bears are currently in charge. From a day-trade perspective, our bias is bearish; however, price is currently around a Daily swing low @ 1.6261 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line), hence the bears might experience some difficulties. Looking toward the left side of the Daily chart, we would notice the 1.6261 level is a critical level as price had reacted to it a number of times in the past.  
In all, our conclusion is to seek Short trade setups on the Hourly chart – supported by the H4 chart, while bearing in mind this critical 1.6261 level.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing low @ 1.6496 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) downward. That automatically shifts our bias in favor of a downward price move. The white horizontal line @ 1.6744 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.   
****  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

**On the Daily chart** (attcahed), we concluded last week that price seems to be in a major downward or bearish channel, and the current pattern of lower high and lower low on the Daily chart is buttressing that view. We also identified a Daily swing low @ 1.6261 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) as a critical support level that the bears must contend with; and in accordance with our expectation, the 1.6261 level proved itself – probably even more than we anticipated. Although, last week trading ended with a big rally, and price sort of resumed the upward move earlier today, all factors supporting our bearish bias are still pretty much in place; hence, we would want to consider the current bullish move as a deep bullish retracement. From a day-trade perspective, our bias still tend toward a downward move, however, we might have to exercise patience as the Hourly Short trade setups – supported by the H4 chart – might take some time to unfold. Consequently, from the standpoint of this thread’s method, we’re probably done with this pair for this month.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), last week, price broke, at that time, the most recent swing low @ 1.6496 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) downward. That automatically shifted our bias in favor of a downward price move. However, as discussed on the Daily chart, we would observe price is currently rallying, but supported by the overall price movement, we are still sticking with our bearish bias. In other words, we’re considering current price action as only a deep bullish retracement. Again, we might have to exercise patience as the Hourly trade setups might take some time to unfold.  
The white horizontal line @ 1.6744 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.   
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), we would observe price is currently, more or less, in a dicey situation: while our bias still remains bearish – partly due to the Daily lower high lower low formation that’s still intact as well as price’s bearish close yesterday – current price action is moving farther away from the previous day’s low @ 1.6379 (not highlighted) and, instead, advancing toward the previous day’s high – a not so good sign for the bears. We usually like to see price break below previous days’ lows to strengthen our bearish biases. Today is turning out to be another “waiting day” on the GBPUSD pair.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), we have a closer observation of current bullish price action. Again, though, our bias is still bearish, price has rallied a relatively great distance away from the most recent swing low – also the previous day’s low @ 1.6379 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line). In short, our bearish bias is waning; however, the white horizontal line @ 1.6591 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), the overall downward trend of this pair is pretty much obvious. Currently, price is within a narrow downward or bearish channel. It hit the upper edge of the bearish channel late last month (or late last week), and since then, it has reversed downward. We anticipate further bearish movement toward the lower edge of the narrow bearish channel; although we would expect price to meet some hurdles around the most recent Daily swing low – the current year-low @ 0.9915 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line). From a day-trade perspective, our bias is bearish, however, we would like to see price break below the previous day’s low @ 0.9969 (not highlighted) before seeking our Hourly short trade setups – supported by the H4 chart.   
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price broke the, at that time, most recent swing low @ 0.9992 (which we’ve highlighted using the uppermost blue broken line) downward. That automatically shifted our bias in favor of a downward price move. As discussed on the Daily chart, before seeking Hourly Short trade setups, we would like to see price break below the previous day’s low – also the most recent swing low @ 0.9969 (which we’ve highlighted using the middle blue broken line). The critical support level – the current year-low @ 0.9915 (that we’ve highlighted using the lowest blue broken line), which we also discussed on the Daily chart, is seen on the H4 chart. We have about a 50-pip gap between the previous day’s low and the year-low @ 0.9969 and 0.9915, respectively. From a day-trade perspective, the 50-pip gap is fairly a moderate distance, allowing us to seek Hourly Short trades.  
The white horizontal line @ 1.0073 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.   
****  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), continuing from yesterday, price is currently still within the narrow downward or bearish channel, and, supported by the most recent price action: price break below previous days’ lows, which apparently include yesterday’s low @ 0.9977 (not highlighted), we are still anticipating further bearish movement toward the lower edge of the narrow bearish channel. Again, as discussed yesterday, while gunning for the lower edge of the channel, we would expect price to meet some hurdles around the most recent Daily swing low – the current year-low @ 0.9915 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line). From a day-trade perspective, our bias remains bearish while keeping the critical 0.9915 support level in mind.   
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing low @ 0.9977 (which we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line) downward. That automatically sustains our bias in favor of a downward price move. The critical support level – the current year-low @ 0.9915 (that we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line), which we discussed on the Daily chart, is seen on the H4 chart. We have about a 60-pip gap between current price position and the year-low @ 0.9915: a moderate distance allowing us to seek Hourly Short trades from a day-trade perspective  
The white horizontal line @ 1.0026 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.   
****  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.

**Pls NOTE:** As always, if there’s one particular day in every month that trending method/pattern traders should be wary of trading most, it has to be the first Fridays of every month when the Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) report is usually released.  
While I’ll go ahead to give my personal analysis on the USDJPY pair, please, let’s bear in mind that, regardless of any technical analyses, NFP usually rules today.  
  
**On the Daily chart** (attached), since late last month, price has been in an upward retracement in an overall visible longer term downtrend. However, currently, the bulls seem to have reached a critical resistance-confluence where the bears might attempt to take control: price is now around a downward or bearish trend-line (that we’ve highlighted using the red solid line), which we expect might restrain any further bullish move, at least temporarily. In addition, current price position is also around a major resistance level – the most recent Weekly swing low @ 87.99 (which we’ve highlighted on the Daily chart using the upper blue broken line). In the case of the 87.99 resistance level, since it has been breached yesterday, depending on where price closes at the end of today, it would end up retaining its resistance level “status” or becoming a new support level: price break above previous day’s high @ 88.47 (not highlighted) should validate it as a new support level.   
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price broke, at that time, the most recent swing high @ 87.37 (which we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line) upward. That automatically sustained our bias in favor of an upward price move. However, as discussed on the Daily chart, the bulls are, at the moment, probably in the bears’ zone, hence to be convinced of the bulls’ strength, we would like to see price break above the previous day’s high – also the most recent swing high @ 88.47 (which we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line).   
The green horizontal line @ 86.50 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it – in the absence of any new and higher swing low – our bullish or upward bias remains intact; but, again, today is “NFP Day”, please let’s keep that in mind.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), the first couple of days in December – precisely Tuesday and Wednesday last week – we saw the bulls threatening to nullify our bearish bias on the GBPUSD as there was a deep bullish retracement toward the most recent Daily swing high @ 1.6744 (which we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line). However, the downward or bearish trend-line (which we’ve highlighted using the red solid line), joining forces with the 1.6744 level, put up a strong resistance against price rally; as a result, since last week Thursday, price has resumed its downward movement. Earlier today, price broke the previous trading day’s low – Friday’s low @ 1.6421 (not highlighted), and that sustains our bearish bias from a day-trade perspective. We expect the next critical support area to be around the most recent Daily swing low @ 1.6269 (which we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line).  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing low @ 1.6421 (which we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line) downward.

As discussed on the Daily chart, we expect the next critical support area to be around the most recent Daily swing low @ 1.6269 (which we’ve highlighted on the H4 chart using the lower blue broken line) – about 80 pips away from current price position. Price’s swoon earlier today has been very sharp – it has already moved downward by over 150 pips, hence a bullish retracement, which might create an Hourly Short trade set-up won’t be a surprise.  
The white horizontal line @ 1.6668 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.   
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

****  
**On the Daily chart** (attached), late last week, the bulls’ attempt to make a new year-high was rebuffed as price reversed @ 1.5140 – only 3 pips shy of the current year high @ 1.5143 (which we’ve pointed out using the green arrow). Since then, price has been in a “consistent” downward move, threatening the longer term bullish scenario. From a day-trade perspective, our bias is currently bearish. Yesterday, price broke below the most recent Daily swing low @ 1.4827 (that we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line), which strengthens our bearish bias; although price reversed upward to close around the 1.4827 level – forming a quasi reversal candle in the process. In other words, yesterday’s price action supports our bearish bias but, at the same time, tells us to be cautious while seeking Short trades.  
An important observation, which buttresses the notion of a threatened longer term bullish scenario is the negative MACD Divergence currently seen on the Daily chart (which we’ve identified using the red bold lines on both upper and lower panes of the chart). A –ve MACD Divergence signals a possibility of an imminent, notable price-collapse.   
To be further convinced of the bears’ readiness to continue their downward move today, we would like to see price break below the previous day’s low @ 1.4755 (not highlighted). We expect the next critical support @ 1.4625 (which we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line).  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price broke, at that time, the most recent swing low @ 1.4821 (which we’ve highlighted using the uppermost blue broken line) downward. That automatically sustained our bias in favor of a downward price move. However, since then, price has been struggling to stay decisively below the level (i.e. the 1.4821 level); as a result, the most recent swing low – also the previous day’s low @ 1.4755 (which we’ve highlighted using the middle blue broken line) has remained “untouched.” As discussed on the Daily chart, we would like to see price break below this 1.4755 level to be further convinced of the bears’ readiness to continue their downward move today. Also seen on the H4 chart is the 1.4625 level (which we’ve highlighted using the lowest blue broken line), which we expect to be the next critical support level.  
The white horizontal line @ 1.4904 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.   
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), apart from the major downward or bearish channel, which we identified late last month, price is currently within a “minor” one (i.e a “minor” bearish channel). Early price action today had the bears push toward the lower edge of the “minor” bearish channel (the red channel) where they met strong support. At the moment, possibly as a result of the lower edge of the channel, price has retraced upward. While our bias remains bearish, let’s keep in mind this “minor” channel as it might send price retracing further upward – perhaps toward its upper edge. To be on the safe side, it would seem good for us to wait till price closes decisively below the lower edge of the bearish channel – meaning “forgetting” this pair for today.   
However, due to strong signals in favor of the bears, as more aggressive traders, we could go ahead to seek Hourly Short trade setups – supported by the H4 chart – while keeping in mind price actions around the lower edge of the channel.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing low @ 1.6254 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) downward. That automatically sustains our bias in favor of a downward price move. Probably due to the lower edge of the “minor” bearish channel discussed on the Daily chart, we would observe that current price action seems to be forming a reversal candle formation, which might initiate a bullish retracement – although we won’t be able to ascertain any reversal formation until the current H4 candle is fully formed.   
The white horizontal line @ 1.6514 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.   
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

****  
**On the Daily chart** (attached), continuing from yesterday, we would observe the lower edge of the “minor” channel (the red channel) is still doing a good job of stalling the bears’ move. The previous day’s candle closed as a reversal candle (Doji), which indicates the likelihood of a bullish retracement, possibly toward the upper edge of the channel. Supported by the current lower-high lower-low formation on the Daily chart – as well as other price patterns/actions – our bias, from a day-trade perspective, remains bearish. However, partly because of the channel’s lower edge and the previous day’s Doji formation, to be further convinced of the bears’ readiness to continue their move today, we would prefer to see price break below the previous day’s low @ 1.6165 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line).  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price broke, at that time, the most recent swing low @ 1.6254 (which we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line) downward. That automatically sustained our bias in favor of a downward price move. However, the 1.6254 level was the same level we mentioned yesterday; and we could observe how price is currently struggling to stay clearly above or below it.   
As discussed on the Daily chart, “to be further convinced of the bears’ readiness to continue their move today, we would prefer to see price break below the previous day’s low – _also the most recent swing low_ @ 1.6165 (which we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line).  
The white horizontal line @ 1.6367 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.   
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), we would observe the GBPUSD, more or less, consolidated throughout yesterday – resulting in an “inside candle” reversal candle formation: a scenario where the most recent fully formed candle’s, or, in this case, the previous day’s candle’s high and low are within the penultimate candle’s high and low. The “inside candle” formation further confirms the possibility of a bullish retracement that was probably initiated when price hit the lower edge of the “minor” downward or bearish channel (the red channel) a couple of days ago – precisely Wednesday this week. Again, as it has been alluded to since Wednesday, in the case of a deeper bullish retracement, we expect price to rally toward the upper edge of the bearish channel.  
Currently, from a day trade perspective, our bias is shifting to favor the bulls; however, to be further convinced, we would like to see a “breakout” i.e we would like to see price break-above the shorter candle of the “inside candle” formation, which also means price-break above the previous day’s high @ 1.6346 (not highlighted).  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), to buttress the current consolidation phase on the GBPUSD, we would observe price is yet to break above the most recent swing high – also the previous day’s high @ 1.6346 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line). Based on the method discussed on this thread, we always prefer to see price-break above the most recent H4 swing high – in the case of a bullish bias – to be further convinced of the bulls’ readiness to move.  
The downward or bearish channel we’ve been discussing on the Daily chart is also seen on the H4 chart, and that allows us to get a better appraisal of current price action within the channel. The green horizontal line @ 1.6213 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it – in the absence of any new and higher swing low – our bullish or upward bias remains intact.   
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels – to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), last week, we observed a negative MACD Divergence, which often signals a possibility of strong downward price move. The –ve divergence is still very much intact. Also supporting the bearish scenario is the decisive break below the most recent Daily swing low @ 1.4827 (which we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line). Last week Friday, price breached another strong support level – the most recent Weekly swing low @ 1.4625 (which we’ve highlighted on the Daily chart using the lower blue broken line), and barely closed below it. From a day-trade perspective, to be convinced that the 1.4625 support has been clearly broken, we would like to see the bears push further to break the previous trading day’s low – Friday’s low @ 1.4585 (not highlighted).   
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price broke, at that time, the most recent swing low @ 1.4685 (which we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line) downward. That automatically sustained our bias in favor of a downward price move. However, as discussed on the Daily chart, before seeking Short trade setups on the Hourly chart, we would prefer to see price break below Friday’s low – also the most recent swing low @ 1.4585 (which we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line).  
The white horizontal line @ 1.4774 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.   
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), price closed yesterday forming an “inside candle” formation, which signaled a possible indecision in the direction traders wanted to go. However, early price action today has breached the previous day’s and the penultimate day’s lows @ 1.4604 and 1.4585 (both not highlighted), respectively; that action automatically nullified the significance of the “inside candle” formation. Please NOTE today’s early price action also confirms that the important support level discussed yesterday – the most recent Weekly swing low @ 1.4625 (that we’ve highlighted on the Daily chart using the upper blue broken line) has been clearly broken.   
Our bias is currently bearish. The next critical support level is another Weekly swing low @ 1.4480 (which we’ve highlighted on the Daily chart using the lower blue broken line). We seem to have enough room to seek Hourly Short trade setups – supported by the H4 chart.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing low @ 1.4585 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) downward. That automatically sustains our bias in favor of a downward price move.   
The white horizontal line @ 1.4684 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.   
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), for about two weeks now, price has been in a relatively “smooth” downward move – probably initiated, or at least aided by the negative MACD Divergence and a few other price actions. The bears are now around another major support level that we mentioned yesterday: a Weekly swing low @ 1.4480 (which we’ve highlighted on the Daily chart using the lower blue broken line). Given the steep price-collapse the EURUSD has been experiencing, it won’t be surprising to see the 1.4480 level acting as a very strong support, which might possibly aid a bullish retracement. That, however, is for now a mere conjecture: the information we have at the moment is still good enough to sustain our bearish bias from a day-trade perspective. In seeking Short trade opportunities, we would like to see price break below previous day’s low @ 1.4503 (not highlighted); but to be on the safe side – especially for more conservative traders – it’s even better to see price close below the critical 1.4480 support level – meaning waiting for today’s candle’s close before taking action.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price broke, at that time, the most recent swing low @ 1.4585 (which we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line) downward. That automatically sustained our bias in favor of a downward price move. As discussed on the Daily chart, before seeking Hourly Short trade setups, we would, at least, like to see price break below the previous day’s low – also the most recent swing low @ 1.4503 (which we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line).   
The white horizontal line @ 1.4684 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.   
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), early price action today has probably put an end to the indecision among traders about whether to buy or sell the GBPUSD pair. For about a week now, the GBPUSD pair has been in a consolidation phase – a phase where, as mentioned above, traders are yet to make up their minds in which direction to go.   
Earlier today, price swooned by almost 200pips to breach a critical support level @ 1.6165 (which we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line) – an action that automatically created another lower high, lower low formation. Currently, from a day-trade perspective, our bearish bias has “resumed.” The next critical support is expected around a potential support-confluence of another Weekly swing low @ 1.5982 (which we’ve highlighted on the Daily chart using the lower blue broken line) and the lower edge of the “minor” downward or bearish channel (the red channel) that we discussed last week.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing low @ 1.6230 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) downward. That automatically sustains our bias in favor of a downward price move.   
The white horizontal line @ 1.6410 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.   
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), as it’s clearly seen, the USDCHF has been in strong uptrend – at least from a medium term perspective; consequently, we’ve been having many daily bullish biases in the past weeks. From a day trade perspective, our bias is still in favor of the bulls, however, price is currently in an area we could regard as a notable resistance area which includes the upper edge of a downward or bearish channel and a Weekly swing high @ 1.0450 (which we’ve highlighted on the Daily chart using the blue broken line). Buttressing the potential strength of this resistance area is price’s current inability to break above yesterday’s high @ 1.0507 (not highlighted); instead, the bears are attempting to breach the previous day’s low @ 1.0381 (also not highlighted).  
As earlier said, our daily bias remains bullish, but we have enough contradictory signs to make us exercise patience in seeking an Hourly long trade setup, on this pair, until we have a clearer coast.   
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price broke, at that time, the most recent swing high @ 1.0424 (which we've highlighted using the blue broken line) upward. That sustained our bias in favor of an upward price move.  
However, in line with conflicting signs observed on the Daily chart, we also have what could be described as a strong, waving negative MACD Divergence on the H4 chart (not identified), which fully supports the possibility of an imminent – probably major – bearish retracement.  
The green horizontal line @ 1.0342 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it - in the absence of any new and higher swing low - our bullish or upward bias remains intact.  
  
However, for more aggressive traders, we still need our Hourly charts - using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels - to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

Thanks a lot Baby, happy holidays to you too – and everyone. It’s been a very great trading year; and a challenging one too.  
  
I wish us all Godspeed in 2010.

Hi Hgnr,  
  
You’re probably judging by the daily analyses. This trading technique involves analyses on higher time frames (H4 chart, Daily, etc.) to understand the bigger picture.  
The fibo technique is only employed on the Hourly chart when it’s supported by the H4 chart and above. There are a number of previous posts on this thread where you’ll find the application of the Hourly fibo technique. Please check them out.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), we would observe price has been forming new lower highs and lower lows: a formation that fully supports a bearish bias. Last week Thursday, price broke below, at that time, a critical support level @ 1.6165 (that we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line), which created an opportunity for the bears to resume their activities. _Please NOTE the broken 1.6165 level has since then turned to a good resistance level – preventing upward price movement._   
As a result of the broken former support level, we concluded last week our bearish bias had been sustained and we would expect the next critical support at a potential support-confluence of a Weekly swing low @ 1.5982 (which we’ve highlighted on the Daily chart using the lower blue broken line) and the lower edge of the “minor” downward or bearish channel (the red channel) that we’ve been discussing for a while. Today, our bearish bias remains intact. While seeking opportunities to sell, let’s bear in mind the bears might meet certain hurdles around Friday’s low @ 1.6051 (not highlighted). Although price is currently about 50 pips away from it – giving room for potential selling opportunities – more conservative traders might prefer to wait for price-break below it to be more convinced of the bears’ resolve.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price broke, at that time, the most recent swing low @ 1.6109 (which we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line) downward. That automatically sustained our bias in favor of a downward price move. The Friday’s low – also the most recent swing low @ 1.6051 (that we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line), which we discussed on the Daily chart as a support level to keep in mind is seen on the H4 chart.   
The white horizontal line @ 1.6248 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.   
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), yesterday, as anticipated, price continued its downward move. It broke Friday’s low @ 1.6051 and then moved further downward toward the critical support area – the potential support-confluence of a Weekly swing low @ 1.5982 (which we’ve highlighted on the Daily chart using the lower blue broken line) and the lower edge of the “minor” downward or bearish channel (the red channel). However, the bears’ momentum seems to be waning as price, after breaking the 1.6051 level, traveled down only about 20 pips to 1.6027 before moving back upward to close @ 1.6048 – almost the same level with 1.6051. The fact that the above price action occurred at an area very close to the support-confluence of Weekly swing low and channel’s lower edge suggests the bears are already in a bullish zone.   
Although, our bias remains bearish from a day-trade perspective, current price actions described above are telling us to take extra caution while seeking Short trade opportunities. Price-break below the previous day’s low @ 1.6027 (not highlighted) would have been a good sign telling us about the bears’ readiness to continue their move, but, due to price’s current proximity to the support-confluence, we are, most likely, already in the bulls’ zone.   
In all, our bearish bias remains but current signs tell us to exercise a great deal of caution as we seek to sell this pair.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing low @ 1.6051 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) downward. That automatically sustains our bias in favor of a downward price move. However, buttressing the observations on the Daily chart, we would observe price is yet to break decisively below the 1.6051 level. That again tells us the bears are most likely within the bulls’ zone – especially when seen in light of price’s proximity to the critical support-confluence of the Weekly swing low @ 1.5982 and the lower edge bearish channel  
The white horizontal line @ 1.6248 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.   
  
However, for more aggressive traders, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), we would observe price is currently around a possible bull-zone: In the past days, we’ve been discussing the possibility of the bears’ move being stalled around a critical support area – the support-confluence of a Weekly swing low @ 1.5982 (which we’ve highlighted on the Daily chart using the blue broken line) and the lower edge of the “minor” downward or bearish channel (the faint gray channel).   
However, yesterday, price breached the 1.5982 level and closed below the “minor” bearish channel – a sign that the bears are probably resolved to keep their momentum and disregard the support-confluence. To be more convinced of a continued downward price move, we would prefer to see price break below yesterday’s low @ 1.5920 (not highlighted). If eventually price breaks decisively below the support confluence, our focus will then be on the lower edge of the “major” bearish channel (the red channel), which we would expect to be the next major support area. In all, our bias remains bearish and with clearer coast, we would be seeking Hourly Short trade setups – with the support of the H4 chart.

The white horizontal line @ 1.6099 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.   
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), starting around the beginning of the last month in 2009, December, the EURUSD pair got caught in a very strong wave of a downward price movement which, most likely, was partly triggered by a negative MACD divergence observed on the Daily chart. The pair later had a shallow bullish retracement which met strong resistance about 20 pips away from a critical resistance level – a previous Weekly swing low @ 1.4480 (which we’ve highlighted on the Daily chart using the upper blue broken line).  
Observing current price movement, the bears seem set to continue their movement, however, there’s a critical support level – the most recent Daily swing low @ 1.4216 (that we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line), which we would like to see price break below to be further convinced of the bears’ resolve. In all, our bias is bearish. Conservative traders would probably wait for the break of the 1.4216 level before seeking any Hourly Short trade setup – supported by the H4 chart.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has breached the most recent swing low @ 1.4272 (which we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line) downward. That automatically sustains our bias in favor of a downward price move. However, we would notice price is struggling to stay below the 1.4272 level – a sign that the bears might currently be facing some hurdles; and that buttresses the suggestion discussed on the Daily chart that we would prefer price to break below a critical support level – the most recent Daily swing low @ 1.4216 (that we’ve highlighted on the H4 chart using the lower blue broken line) to be convinced of the bears’ readiness to keep moving.   
Price is currently about a 100 pips away from the 1.4216 level, hence, more aggressive traders might attempt to seek an Hourly Short trade setup while keeping in mind that the EURUSD pair is possibly, currently within the bulls’ zone.  
The white horizontal line @ 1.4439 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.   
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.

****  
**On the Daily chart** (attached), since late last year we’ve been monitoring price behavior within two downward or bearish channels: a “minor” channel (the red channel) which is seen within a “major” channel (the faint gray channel). The minor bearish channel, for quite a while now, has been doing a very good job of guiding price’s upward and downward moves. Yesterday, price hit the upper edge of the “minor” bearish channel, reversed rather sharply and consequently closed as a reversal candle formation. That price action signaled a strong possibility of the bears resuming their action in an overall or longer term bearish trend. Further buttressing the bears resolve is earlier price action today, which resulted in price breaking below the previous day’s low @ 1.6056 (not highlighted). From a day-trade perspective, our bias is now in favor of the bears. The coast seems clear enough for us to seek Hourly Short trade setups – supported by the H4 chart.  
We expect the next important support level to be the lower edge of the “minor” bearish channel.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), in line with our expectation yesterday, price continued its bearish move and closed as a bear-bodied candle which, to an extent, signifies the strength of the bears. Earlier today, price collapsed further to break below the previous day’s low @ 1.5964 (not highlighted): another good sign confirming the downward price movement, most likely, still has momentum. However, currently, from a day-trade point of view, price seems to be in a bullish retracement; hence we might have to wait for a clearer coast before placing our Short trades on this currency pair.  
The Hourly lower-high, lower-low price formation, which is a condition that must be met before seeking Short trades – based on the primary method discussed on this thread – would be a good way of determining the appropriate time to start seeking today’s Short trades.  
As previously mentioned, once the bears resume their actions, we expect the next important support level to be the lower edge of the “minor” bearish channel.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), yesterday, price broke the most recent swing low @ 1.6056 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) downward. That automatically sustained our bias in favor of a downward price move. As discussed on the Daily chart, analyzing from a day-trade perspective, we would observe price is currently having a bullish retracement; hence, a clearer coast (as discussed above) should be helpful before seeking Short trades today.  
The white horizontal line @ 1.6152 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.   
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), again in line with our expectation yesterday, price had its bullish retracement, and then subsequently resumed its bearish move toward the lower edge of the “minor” downward or bearish channel. Although, yesterday’s candle closed as a “doji” – signaling the possibility of a deeper bullish retracement – price disregarded the sign and went ahead to break the previous day’s low @ 1.5936 (not highlighted). Now that the coast seems much clearer, the bearish channel’s lower edge – as the next important support level – is back in focus. Another critical support level we should keep in mind is the most recent Daily swing low @ 1.5831 (that we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line), which is currently some pips above the channel’s lower edge. We should consider the area between the 1.5831 level and the channel’s lower edge as a possible bulls’ zone as price moves further downward toward the area.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing low @ 1.5936 (which we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line) downward. That automatically sustains our bias in favor of a downward price move. We could observe on the H4 chart the important 1.5831 support level (which we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line) that we discussed on the Daily chart. Price is currently about a 100 pips away from the support level; hence, we seem to have enough room to go short on the currency pair based on the Hourly setups.   
The white horizontal line @ 1.6057 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.   
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

****  
**Pls NOTE:** As always, if there’s one particular day in every month that trending method/pattern traders should be wary of trading most, it has to be the first Fridays of every month when the Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) report is usually released.  
While I’ll go ahead to give my personal analysis on the USDJPY pair, please, let’s bear in mind that, regardless of any technical analyses, NFP usually rules today.  
****  
**On the Daily chart** (attached), we would observe a steep upward movement in price, which is captured within a relatively narrow upward or bullish channel. In line with the longer term upward trend, the bulls were fully in charge yesterday. However, early price action today is showing the possibility of, at least, a shallow bearish retracement as price couldn’t break above previous day’s high @ 93.76 (not highlighted). Also, though barely noticeable, we would observe a waving negative MACD divergence if we look closely. That is a sign supporting the possibility of a bearish retracement.   
Pls NOTE: A waving MACD divergence is yet to be a valid divergence; hence it’s a relatively weak indicator.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price broke, at that time, the most recent swing high @ 92.73 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) upward. That automatically sustained our bias in favor of an upward price move. However, to buttress our “bearish retracement” observation on the Daily chart, the waving negative MACD Divergence is more noticeable on the H4. Again, in line with the longer term upward trend, our bias remains bullish, but current price action is telling us to exercise patience in seeking long trade setups on the this currency pair as it seems the bears are resolved to fight back – even if it’s only for a while.   
The green horizontal line @ 92.09 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it – in the absence of any new and higher swing low – our bullish or upward bias remains intact; but, again, today is “NFP Day”, please let’s keep that in mind.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), since November, last year, the GBPUSD pair has been in a bearish mode – forming new lower highs and lower lows. However, current price action, which started on Friday, last week, is giving indications the bears might be losing their grip – at least for a while: Price was unable to move down close to – let alone break below – the most recent Daily swing low @ 1.5831 (which we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line). A break below the 1.5831 level would have suggested the bears were ready to push further downward. Also, price is yet to break above the most recent Daily swing high @ 1.6240 (which we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line). A break above the 1.6240 level would give a strong sign the bears have lost momentum.  
As a result of the situation analyzed above, it’s reasonable to conclude that the GBPUSD is currently in a state of indecision. This indecisive mode is well captured in the current symmetrical triangle formation observed on the Daily chart.  
Although, from a day-trade perspective, current price action is supporting a bullish bias more than a bearish one, we have enough reasons to be cautious of seeking Long trade setups. Moreover, the “gap” created as a result of the difference between Friday’s close @ 1.6020 and Monday’s open @ 1.6057 is expected to be closed-up – and that would necessitate a bearish move. Hence, more conservative traders might prefer to wait for a clearer coast before placing trades today.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing high @ 1.6109 (which we've highlighted using the blue broken line) upward. That shifts our bias in favor of an upward price move. However, we would also observe in closer proximity price’s action around the upper edge of the symmetrical triangle mentioned on the Daily chart. Again, we have enough reasons to be cautious of seeking Long trade setups for now, and more conservative traders might prefer to wait for a clearer coast before placing trades today.  
The green horizontal line @ 1.5895 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it - in the absence of any new and higher swing low - our bullish or upward bias remains intact.  
  
However, for more aggressive traders, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels – to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

****  
**On the Daily chart** (attached), last week Friday, we discussed the possibility of a bearish retracement based on certain signals – one of which was a waving negative MACD Divergence. Although, as earlier said, a waving MACD Divergence is relatively not a very strong indicator of future price movement, it was however good enough to caution us.  
With recent events, it turned out the bearish signals were helpful as price has been in a bearish mode for a couple of days now. From a medium term perspective, our bullish bias remains intact until price breaks below a critical support level – the most recent Daily swing low @ 91.24 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line). Contrastingly, from a day-trade perspective, which is our focus on this thread, our bias has shifted in favor of the bears. However, price’s downward move is getting close to the critical support level @ 91.24, and the bears might experience difficulties breaking below it. Due to this proximity of current price position to the support level, more conservative traders might prefer to wait and see price break below it before seeking Hourly Short trade setups – supported by the H4 chart.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has breached the most recent swing low @ 91.80 (which we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line) downward. That automatically sustains our bias in favor of a downward price move.   
We could observe, more clearly, the now valid negative MACD Divergence: that gives additional support to the current downward movement. We could also observe on the H4 chart the important 91.24 support level (which we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line) that we discussed on the Daily chart. Price is currently about 60 pips away from the support level; hence, for more aggressive traders, there seems to be enough room to go short on this currency pair based on the Hourly setups.   
The white horizontal line @ 92.65 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.   
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), before the close of yesterday’s candle, price broke below the critical support level – the most recent Daily swing low @ 91.24 (that we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line), which we discussed yesterday. Consequently, our day-trade bias remains bearish, and now the medium term bias has followed suit. However, to further confirm the 91.24 level has been decisively broken, we would like to see price move below yesterday’s low @ 90.71 (not highlighted).   
Price is probably, at the moment, in a bullish retracement on higher time frames i.e. time frame charts higher than the Hourly chart, hence, based on the method discussed on this thread, we might need to exercise patience before seeking Short trade setups on our Hourly charts – supported by the H4 chart.   
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price broke, at that time, the most recent swing low @ 91.80 (which we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line) downward. That automatically sustained our bias in favor of a downward price move.   
However, as discussed on the Daily chart, price, at the moment, seems to be in a bullish retracement and we would like to see price break below a new support level – yesterday’s low as well as the most recent H4 swing low @ 90.71 for us to be more convinced of the bears readiness to push further downward.  
The white horizontal line @ 92.65 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.   
  
However, once we have a clearer coast, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), recent price actions have reversed the bearish trend that we’ve been familiar with for the past two months: yesterday, price broke above an important resistance level – the most recent Daily swing high @ 1.6240 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line), and, as a result, we are beginning to see price pattern having a higher-high, higher-low formation, which is a very strong sign of a bullish scenario. At least for the time being, we expect price to continue moving northward, hence, our bias from a day-trade perspective has further strengthened in favor of the bulls. Furthermore, price has broken above yesterday’s high @ 1.6306 (not highlighted): a further confirmation of the bulls’ resolve.   
Based on the overall scenario, the coast seems clear enough for us to seek Long trade setups on our Hourly charts – supported by the H4 chart.   
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing high @ 1.6193 (which we've highlighted using the blue broken line) upward. That sustains our bias in favor of an upward price move.   
The green horizontal line @ 1.6135 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it - in the absence of any new and higher swing low - our bullish or upward bias remains intact.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels – to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows. Please note that our aim is to buy a dip in today's up-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), the bears seem set to continue their “campaign” with price breaching the most recent swing low @ 90.71 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) downward. The whole downward move that was probably triggered, partly, by a not too visible negative MACD divergence could possibly be the end of the bulls’ reign that started around late November, last year. Based on the big picture (please refer to your Monthly charts), this current bearish move could as well be the resumption of a very long term downward trend that the USDJPY currency pair has been experiencing for years.  
However, from a day-trade perspective, although price has breached the 90.71 support, which signifies the possibility of price’s downward movement continuing, it (price) is yet to break below it (90.71 support) decisively; hence, more conservative traders might prefer to see today’s candle close below the support level before seeking Hourly Short trade setups – supported by the H4 chart. Unfortunately, that means keeping off this pair for today.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing low @ 90.83 (which we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line) downward. That automatically sustains our bias in favor of a downward price move. The 90.71 support level (that we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line), which we discussed on the Daily chart is also seen on the H4 chart. We could observe the 90.83 and 90.71 support levels are rather close; that strengthens the notion that the bears are currently around a very strong support area and it would be preferable to see price break below the area decisively to be more convinced of the bears resolve – as alluded to on the Daily chart,.  
The white horizontal line @ 92.03 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.   
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

Freedomsg, sorry for the very late reply, but I guess it might still be helpful to everybody.  
  
Your entry and SL seem ok, but I’m not sure if there were other reasons apart from the fibo levels (like previous swing high/lows, pivots, etc.) why you chose to enter and set SL at those points. The same goes for the profit target.  
Then, I hope you considered the reward to risk ratio when determining those SL, entry, and profit levels? It’s very important.  
  
I hope my answer is satisfactory. Enjoy your weekend.****

**On the Daily chart** (attached), on Wednesday, last week, price broke above a former important resistance level - the most recent Daily swing high @ 1.6240 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line), and as a result, our bullish bias was reinforced. As usual, when a resistance level is broken, it turns to a potential support level, and that is exactly the situation that occurred in the case of the broken 1.6240 resistance (now former resistance): we would observe that, after the Wednesday-break, price moved further upward on Thursday, but retraced on Friday to test the 1.6240 level, which then acted, expectedly, as a support level. The 1.6240 proved to be a strong support as price hit it and bounced back upward to break the previous trading day’s high – Friday’s high @ 1.6355 (not highlighted). Consequently, our bullish bias remains on this currency pair.  
Based on the overall scenario, the coast seems clear enough for us to seek Long trade setups on our Hourly charts – supported by the H4 chart.

However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels – to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows. Please note that our aim is to buy a dip in today's up-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

Tunji, you have an interesting method here.  
I don't use the fib levels in the way that you are describing, but I like using the daily charts for determining the trend and the 4 hour chart for finding an entry point.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), as anticipated, the bulls continued their movement yesterday in a very decisive manner, and earlier price action today showed their resolve to keep moving on. However, price is currently around another resistance level – a Daily swing high @ 1.6409 (which we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line). Considering the very steep nature of the ongoing bullish move, which started more than a week ago, it’s reasonable to expect at least a shallow bearish retracement, and the 1.6409 level might be that temporarily insurmountable hurdle that would trigger the bearish retracement. But for now, all we know is the bulls are still fully in control, and consequently, our bias remains bullish - except that we should tread with extra caution i.e. we should be more conscious of subsequent price actions on the lower time frame charts.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing high @ 1.6378 (which we've highlighted using the lower blue broken line) upward. That sustains our bias in favor of an upward price move. However, we would observe price is currently reacting to the 1.6409 resistance level (that we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line), which we discussed on the Daily chart. For now, we can’t deduce much, but once the current H4 candle is fully formed, it could give a clue on where price might be heading.  
The green horizontal line @ 1.6209 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it - in the absence of any new and higher swing low - our bullish or upward bias remains intact.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels – to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows. Please note that our aim is to buy a dip in today's up-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

Thanks Forexhabits, and sorry for the late reply. As you’ve rightly alluded to, I believe the more important thing is to know the story price is telling on higher time frames like the Daily and H4 charts (and above). It helps to see the bigger picture. Entry techniques, to me, are also important but secondary. In short, it’s just okay if you don’t use the Fibonacci tool the way it’s used on this thread.   
  
Regarding indicators, I don’t use indicators, except the MACD – as you’ve probably noticed. Not that I don’t believe they are effective for many traders, but I prefer to read price actions without much “interference.”  
  
Thanks again Forexhabits.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), yesterday, we identified a Daily swing high @ 1.6409 (which we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line) as a potential resistance level that might be a “temporarily insurmountable hurdle that would trigger the bearish retracement.” By the close of yesterday’s candle, it became somewhat clear the 1.6409 was ready to do exactly what we expected of it: fueled by the Core CPI report from Britain @ 09:30GMT, yesterday, price surged to pierce the 1.6409 resistance, but didn’t have enough strength to stay above it. Consequently, the bulls were forced to retreat and yesterday’s candle closed as a reversal candle. Early price action today has further confirmed the strength of the 1.6409 resistance as price broke below previous day’s low @ 1.6311 (not highlighted).   
However, bearing in mind the possibility of the current bearish move being a bearish retracement, the most recent Daily swing high @ 1.6240 (which we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line) is the new support level under focus: given the fact that the 1.6240 support coincides with the fib 38.2% retracement level (drawing the fib from most recent Daily swing low @ 1.5895 to yesterday’s high @ 1.6457), which isn’t shown on the chart to avoid a cluttered chart, there’s a possibility the 1.6240 might stall the bearish retracement.  
In all, from a day-trade perspective, our bias has shifted in favor of the bears, but let’s keep in mind the support confluence around the 1.6240 level.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing low – also the previous day’s low @ 1.6311 (which we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line) downward. That automatically shifts our bias in favor of a downward price move. The new support level under focus, the 1.6240 level (that we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line), which we discussed on the Daily chart, is seen on the H4 chart. Please let’s bear this level in mind.  
However, we’re seeing further sign on the H4 chart that’s telling us the current bearish retracement might not be a shallow one: we have a negative MACD Divergence that’s already in place. A MACD divergence is a relatively strong signal.  
The white horizontal line @ 1.6457 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.   
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.   
  
P.S. Primarily because of the identified 1.6240 support confluence, more conservative trader might opt to refrain from trading this pair for now.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), the bearish retracement we’ve anticipated since Tuesday that was initiated by the resistance level of a Daily swing high @ 1.6409 (which we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line), is proving to be a deep retracement. Yesterday, price reacted to, at that time, a potential support level – the most recent Daily swing high @ 1.6240 (that we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line), which we discussed the previous day as a “the new support level under focus… _that_ might stall the bearish retracement.” Consequently, the bears were unable to break the 1.6240, and that resulted in yesterday’s low @ 1.6242 – just a couple of pips above 1.6240.   
However, earlier today, the bears were able to gather enough momentum to break below the 1.6240 level – automatically breaking the previous day’s low @ 1.6242 in the process. From a day-trade perspective, our bias remains bearish. The next important support level is expected at the upward or bullish trend-line (which is represented by the red dashed line).   
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing low – also the previous day’s low @ 1.6242 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) downward. That automatically sustains our bias in favor of a downward price move. The next important support level, the upward or bullish trend-line (represented by the red dashed line), which we discussed on the Daily chart, is also seen on the H4 chart. Let’s have it in mind.  
The white horizontal line @ 1.6310 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.   
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

****  
**On the Daily chart** (attached), we would observe that yesterday’s price action ended in a reversal candle pattern formed around the resistance area (or a quasi resistance confluence) consisting of a Weekly swing high @ 1.0452 (which we’ve highlighted on the Daily chart using the blue broken line) and the upper edge of a symmetrical triangle formation. Although, that single action in itself is a strong signal that a bearish retracement is imminent or has commenced, price breaking below the previous day’s low @ 1.0402 has further strengthened the possibility of price travelling southward. As expected, our bias now favors the bears.  
In case price eventually swoons, we expect the lower edge of the symmetrical triangle to be the next strong support level.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing low @ 1.0419 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) downward. That automatically shifts our bias in favor of a downward price move.   
The white horizontal line @ 1.0494 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.  
****  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.

****  
**On the Daily chart** (attached), as stated in one of the previous analyses on the USDJPY pair, there’s a possibility that, with the current bearish move that started over two weeks ago, we are seeing the early stage of an overall bearish trend continuation. Price is currently making a lower-high-lower-low formation, which is partially captured within a “quasi” downward or bearish channel, and it’s one of the strongest signals confirming the bears’ reign.  
However, we would observe price is currently around the lower edge of the bearish channel, hence there’s a possibility we might experience a bullish retracement on this currency pair soon. Buttressing a possible bullish retracement is price’s inability to break below the previous trading day’s low – Friday’s low @ 89.77 (not highlighted).  
From a day-trade perspective, our bias is still bearish, but that position is threatened by recent price actions. To be on the safe side, especially for more conservative traders, it’s better to wait for a clearer coast before trading this pair.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price is yet to break below the most recent swing low @ 89.80 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line): a sign telling us the bears might be losing control. Also, we would observe that the most recent swing low @ 89.80 was formed only a few pips above the previous most recent swing low – also Friday’s low @ 89.77 (pointed out with the yellow arrow), forming a “double-bottom” reversal pattern in the process. These are all signs indicating all isn’t well with the bears at the moment.   
As alluded to on the Daily chart, until the 89.77 support is broken, the case for a bearish move is weak – though our bias is still bearish. The white horizontal line @ 90.56 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.  
****  
However, if we eventually have a clearer coast, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.   
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

****  
**On the Daily chart** (attached), since yesterday, we’ve not seen much change based on our view of recent activities on the USDJPY pair: probably due to the lower edge of the downward or bearish channel, which we discussed earlier, yesterday’s price action ended in a bullish mode – creating an “inside candle” reversal candle pattern in the process. However, because of the Asian news that was released during early hours of today, price movement got rather volatile and, consequently, distorted the “ordered” story that was unfolding on the Daily chart as price collapsed sharply to break below the “inside candle” @ 89.77 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) – an action that weakened the strength of the reversal candle pattern.  
Although, our bias remains bearish from a day trade perspective, price is yet to break decisively below the lower edge of the bearish channel; hence the coast remains to be very clear for us for us to seek Short trade setups on the Hourly chart – supported by the H4 chart.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price broke the most recent swing low @ 89.94 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) downward. That automatically sustains our bias in favor of a downward price move. However, we would observe that price is struggling to stay below the 89.94 level as it was forced to sharply retrace upward after the initial break. That price action tells us, just as with yesterday’s, that the bears are still under threat. In all, our bias is still bearish, but the coast isn’t too clear.  
The white horizontal line @ 90.56 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.  
****  
However, for more aggressive traders, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.   
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

****  
**On the Daily chart** (attached), since early December, last year, the bears have been in control of the EURUSD and current price action is showing they are probably resolved to keep situation that way. After the sharp break below the upward or bullish channel, and a subsequent shallow bullish retracement that got stopped about 20 pips below a strong resistance level – the most recent Weekly swing low @ 1.4216 (which we’ve highlighted on the Daily chart using the upper blue broken line), price seems set to continue its southward journey: Yesterday’s candle closed as strong bearish candle and early market activity today has seen price break below the previous day’s low @ 1.4041 (not highlighted) and, more importantly, the most recent Daily swing low @ 1.4028 (which we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line). Consequently, we expect price to continue collapsing. Based on the above analysis, as expected, our bias is currently bearish, although very conservative traders might prefer to wait for today’s candle to close decisively below the 1.4028 level before placing their Short trades.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing low – also the previous day’s low @ 1.4041 (which we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line) downward. That automatically sustains our bias in favor of a downward price move. We would also observe on the H4 chart the important support level – the most recent Daily swing low @ 1.4028 (that we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line), which was discussed on the Daily chart. Currently, price has breached both the 1.4041 and 1.4028 levels. While there might be a tussle between the bulls and bears around these levels for a while, we expect price to eventually continue its southward move.   
The white horizontal line @ 1.4193 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.  
****  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.   
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), as anticipated yesterday, price collapsed further but was unable to close decisively below the critical support level – the most recent Daily swing low @ 1.4028 (which we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line): a sign that the bears were having some difficulties. However, by the early hours of today, the bears gathered more momentum to break further beneath the 1.4028 level – breaking below the previous day’s low @ 1.3992 (not highlighted) in the process; but again, based on current price action, the bears have been forced to retreat as price is now back at the 1.4028 area.  
What the above scenario is simply telling us is that the bears are ready to push further downward, but the bulls are equally resolved not to make it a cake walk for them. Again, from a day-trade perspective, our bias remains bearish, but the coast isn’t too clear. Today’s candle’s close should offer more information about where price might be heading.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing low @ 1.4020 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) downward. That automatically sustains our bias in favor of a downward price move. However, to buttress our “caveat” observation on the Daily chart, we would observe a waving positive MACD divergence on the H4 chart which means a bullish retracement might be imminent. Also, we would observe that, though price broke sharply below the 1.4020 most recent swing low, it’s seriously struggling to stay comfortably below it. We need to exercise patience on this pair for now.   
The white horizontal line @ 1.4178 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.  
****  
However, in the case of a clearer coast, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.   
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

****  
**On the Daily chart** (attached), from the overall perspective, the medium term bullish trend is quite obvious. Currently, the USDCHF pair is forming higher-highs and higher-lows, which could be observed within an upward or bullish channel. Strengthening the case for a continuous bullish move – possibly toward the upper edge of the bullish channel – is the bulls’ eventual break above a previous, critical resistance confluence: the combination of a downward or bearish trend-line (the red solid line) and the most recent Daily swing high @ 1.0494 (identified by the yellow arrow). Price had a relatively decisive break above the resistance confluence as yesterday’s candle closed above it as a bullish candle.   
Based on the above observation, our bias remains in support of price moving upward; however, price’s current inability to break above the previous day’s high @ 1.0554 (not highlighted) is not a good sign supporting the bulls’ resolve to push further upward today. Preferably, we would like to see price break above the 1.0554 level before seeking Long trade setups on the Hourly chart – supported by the H4 chart.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price is yet to break above the most recent swing high @ 1.0546 (which we've highlighted using the blue broken line). That buttresses the need for us to exercise patience in seeking Long trade setups. Although our bias remains bullish, until price breaks above the 1.0546 level, it’s advisable not to long this pair.   
Considering the time of this posting, and today being the last trading day of this week and month, there might not be much to do regarding this pair, today.   
The green horizontal line @ 1.0474 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it - in the absence of any new and higher swing low - our bullish or upward bias remains intact.  
  
However, in the unlikely event that the coast gets clearer today, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels – to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows. Please note that our aim is to buy a dip in today's up-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), virtually throughout last week, price was in a very strong bullish mode, breaking in the process a previous, critical resistance confluence: the combination of a downward or bearish trend-line (the red solid line) and the most recent Daily swing high @ 1.0494 (identified by the yellow arrow). As also discussed on Friday, last week, the Daily chart of the USDCHF pair is forming higher-highs and higher-lows, which could be observed within an upward or bullish channel. All the above observations keep telling us is that the bulls are firmly in control. Hence our bias, from a day-trade perspective, remains bullish and we expect price to travel toward the upper edge of the bullish channel before encountering any major obstacle.  
However, while our bias remains in favor of an upward move, to be more convinced of the bulls’ resolve to keep up the momentum, it wouldn’t be a bad idea to wait for price-break above the previous trading day’s high – Friday’s high @ 1.0641 (not highlighted) before seeking Hourly Long trade setups.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price broke, at that time, the most recent swing high @ 1.0546 (which we've highlighted using the lower blue broken line) upward. That sustained our bias in favor of an upward price move. However, as mentioned on the Daily chart, before seeking Hourly Long trade setups, we would prefer to see price break above the most recent swing high – also Friday’s high @ 1.0641 (which we've highlighted using the upper blue broken line).   
The green horizontal line @ 1.0480 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it - in the absence of any new and higher swing low - our bullish or upward bias remains intact.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels – to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows. Please note that our aim is to buy a dip in today's up-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), we would observe the EURUSD pair has been in a strong longer term downtrend since November, last year; and no strong signal – fundamental or technical – indicate any imminent change of this trend. However, we are getting signals telling us there might be the possibility of a bullish retracement: For the first time in six trading days, yesterday’s candle closed as a bullish candle – forming a quasi reversal candle formation in the process – and that’s a good sign suggesting the bears might be going on a break. Hence, from a day trade perspective, we’re probably having the opportunity to take advantage of a possible bullish retracement by seeking Long trade setups on our Hourly charts – supported by the H4 chart.   
In case the bulls move as anticipated, we expect the first critical resistance around the most recent Daily swing low @ 1.4028 (which we've highlighted using the lower blue broken line).   
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has breached the most recent swing high @ 1.3938 (which we've highlighted using the blue broken line) upward. That shifts our bias in favor of an upward price move. Although, as explained on the Daily chart, price’s big picture is in a strong downtrend, but another bullish sign supporting our daily bullish bias is the positive MACD Divergence observed on the H4 chart. While keeping in mind the overall bearish trend, it is relatively safe, from a day-trade perspective, to seek Hourly Long trade setups.   
The green horizontal line @ 1.3852 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it - in the absence of any new and higher swing low - our bullish or upward bias remains intact.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels – to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows. Please note that our aim is to buy a dip in today's up-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), as expected yesterday, the bulls took control of activities on the EURUSD pair in what we project to be just a bullish retracement in strong, longer term downward trend. We also discussed that, in case the bulls moved as anticipated, we expect the first critical resistance around the most recent Daily swing low @ 1.4028 (which we've highlighted using the lower blue broken line). Currently, price is around this 1.4028 level, hence we won’t be surprised to see the bulls’ move stalled. From a day-trade perspective, our bias remains bullish, but we need to be conscious of current price position – especially since the longer term trend supports the bears.   
In case the bulls eventually break decisively above the 1.4028 level, the next critical resistance is expected around the most recent Daily swing high @ 1.4193 (which we've highlighted using the upper blue broken line). In all, with caution, our aim is to seek Hourly Long trade setups – supported by the H4 chart.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), yesterday, price broke the most recent swing high @ 1.3938 (which we've highlighted using the lower blue broken line) upward. That shifted our bias in favor of an upward price move. As discussed yesterday, another bullish sign supporting our daily bullish bias is the positive MACD Divergence observed on the H4 chart.   
However, as mentioned on the Daily chart, the bigger picture shows a strong downtrend, and price is currently around a critical resistance level – the most recent Daily swing low @ 1.4028 (which we've highlighted on the H4 chart using the upper blue broken line). Again, this means the bears might attempt to resume their actions around this level – in case the currency pair is experiencing a shallow bullish retracement.   
Altogether, for now, our bias remains bullish. The green horizontal line @ 1.3885 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it - in the absence of any new and higher swing low - our bullish or upward bias remains intact.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels – to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows. Please note that our aim is to buy a dip in today's up-trend.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), we would observe the GBPUSD currency pair has been in a steep downward trend since Wed. 20th January, after hitting the upper edge of an upward or bullish channel. Currently, the bears have reached the lower edge of the channel, which, under normal circumstances, we would expect to act as a strong support area – especially with it coinciding with a strong support level: the most recent Daily swing low @ 1.5849 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line).   
However, earlier price action today saw price breaking below the 1.5849 level, and that weakens the notion of the bulls’ momentum being reduced by the lower edge of the bullish channel. Consequently, while keeping in mind possible bullish retracement, our bias, from a day trade perspective, continues to support the bears. Today’s candle close should give us a clearer picture of the direction price might be heading next.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price broke the most recent swing low @ 1.5902 (which we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line) downward. That automatically sustained our bias in favor of a downward price move. The 1.5849 support level (that we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line), which we discussed on the Daily chart (together with the lower edge of the Daily chart bullish channel) is also seen on the H4 chart. The 1.5849 is a level we would prefer to see price break below decisively to be more convinced of the bears resolve to keep controlling price movement.  
The white horizontal line @ 1.6069 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.   
  
However, in case we eventually have a clearer coast, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), it’s very obvious that the USDCHF has been in a relatively steep uptrend for almost a month as price continued rallying with only a couple of shallow bearish retracements. It’s been a clear case of higher high, higher low price pattern. Early bullish action today pushed price to a new height. The bullish move was forecasted by yesterday’s price-break above a former, critical resistance level – the most recent Daily swing high @ 1.0642 (which we've highlighted using the blue broken line). Following price’s decisive close above the 1.0642 level – with a very strong bull-candle – the bulls went ahead to break the previous day’s high @ 1.0675 (not highlighted): a good sign that the bulls were resolved to push further.  
However, price is currently at the upper edge of an upward or bullish channel, which might prove a hurdle for the bulls. Considering the steep nature of price movement, the possibility of an imminent, deeper bearish retracement isn’t farfetched, and that gives more credence to the potential strength of the channel’s upper edge.  
In all, our bias remains bullish, but let’s keep the channel’s upper edge in mind.   
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price broke the most recent swing high @ 1.0606 (which we've highlighted using the blue broken line) upward. That sustained our bias in favor of an upward price move.   
The green horizontal line @ 1.0495 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it - in the absence of any new and higher swing low - our bullish or upward bias remains intact.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels – to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows. Please note that our aim is to buy a dip in today's up-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), we still have a scenario similar to the one discussed last trading day – on Friday, last week. The steep uptrend observed is still intact as Friday’s price action showed the bulls reacted to the upper edge of the upward or bullish channel but still held on as Friday’s candle closed as quasi bullish candle. From a day trade perspective, our bias still remains bullish.   
However, a couple of current price actions today show the bearish retracement is still a possibility: The bulls, at the moment, seem unwilling to push further and break above the previous trading day’s high – Friday’s high @ 1.0794 (not highlighted); also, there’s a high probability that price might attempt to travel southward to close-up the “gap” formed as a result of the difference between Friday’s close @ 1.0723 and Today’s open @ 1.0758.  
While our bias remains bullish, it’s very much advisable that we avoid going Long on this pair till we have a clearer coast.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), we could observe the critical position the bulls have found themselves at the start of a new week: price is yet to break above the most recent swing high @ 1.0794 (that we've highlighted using the blue broken line and the right yellow arrow), which was formed as a result of the bulls’ inability to break above a previous swing high @ 1.0793 (pointed out by the left yellow arrow).   
Again, our day trade bias is still “reluctantly” in favor of the bulls.   
The green horizontal line @ 1.0684 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it - in the absence of any new and higher swing low - our bullish or upward bias remains intact.  
  
However, in case of a clearer coast, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels – to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows.

****  
**On the Daily chart** (attached), yesterday, we discussed the possibility of a bearish retracement based on a couple of price actions that were unfolding. By the close of yesterday’s trading hours, it became more obvious that the bears were prepared to take over as yesterday’s candle closed as a bear-candle – though not a strong one. Furthermore, yesterday’s price activity, in relation to Friday’s, resulted in an “inside-candle” reversal candle pattern: a significant reversal indicator since it occurred at the upper edge of an upward or bullish channel, after a steep bullish trend. To further compound issues for the bulls, current price action has seen price break below previous day’s low @ 1.0682 (not highlighted). Consequently, from a day-trade perspective, our bias has turned bearish.  
However, there’s a critical support level we have to be conscious of as we seek our daily Short trade set ups on the Hourly chart – supported by the H4 chart: the most recent Daily swing high @ 1.0641 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line).  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has breached the most recent swing low @ 1.0682 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) downward. That automatically shifts our bias in favor of a downward price move. However, we could observe that, though price broke below the 1.0682 support level, which is “acting” a dual role as the most recent H4 swing low and the previous day’s low, price is yet to break decisively below it (the 1.0682 level). It would be preferable to see an H4 candle close below this support level to more convinced of a further bearish retracement.  
The white horizontal line @ 1.0794 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.   
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), we had a relatively strong signal on Monday that the bears might be suspending their onslaught as Monday’s trading hours closed as a strong “Doji” (a strong reversal candle pattern) around the lower edge of a downward or bearish channel. Virtually throughout yesterday, Tuesday, the bulls were fully in control and they held on to their gains as yesterday’s candle closed as a strong bull-candle. From a day-trade perspective, our bias has shifted in favor of the bulls and we expect price to continue its upward move toward the important resistance level – the most recent Daily swing low @ 1.5849 (which we've highlighted using the blue broken line).  
However, to be more convinced of the bulls’ readiness to keep on challenging the overall bears' dominance, we would like to see price break above the previous day’s high @ 1.5746 (not highlighted).  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price broke, at that time, the most recent swing high @ 1.5659 (which we've highlighted using the lower blue broken line) upward. That shifted our bias in favor of an upward price move. However, as mentioned on the Daily chart, before seeking Hourly Long trade setups, we would prefer to see price break above the most recent swing high – also yesterday’s high @ 1.5746 (which we've highlighted using the upper blue broken line).   
The green horizontal line @ 1.5561 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it - in the absence of any new and higher swing low - our bullish or upward bias remains intact.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels – to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows. Please note that our aim is to buy a dip in today's up-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

****  
**On the Daily chart** (attached), earlier this week, on Tuesday, we anticipated a bearish retracement on this currency pair as we observed a reversal candle pattern, an “inside candle” at the upper edge of the upward or bullish channel. We also concluded that the bearish retracement might end up being a shallow one if the critical support level – the most recent Daily swing high @ 1.0641 (which we've highlighted using the lower blue broken line) proves to be an insurmountable hurdle for the bears; and currently, the 1.0641 support is proving to be just that: an “insurmountable hurdle.” Since the late trading hours on Tuesday, price has tested and re-tested the 1.0641 level in an attempt to break decisively below it, but, up till now, it’s still an unfortunate story for the bears.   
From, a day-trade perspective, our bias is reluctantly aligning with the longer term bullish trend because a couple of resistance levels still need to be broken for us to be fully convinced of the bulls readiness to resume their dominance. The hurdles include yesterday’s high @ 1.0720 (not highlighted), and the potential resistance confluence of the upper edge of channel and the most recent Daily swing high @ 1.0794 (which we've highlighted using the upper blue broken line).  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), we could observe that price is yet to break above the most recent swing high – also yesterday’s high @ 1.0720 (which we've highlighted using the lower blue broken line) upward. That buttresses our position that the bulls are yet to fully resume their activity. Hence, in line with what we discussed on the Daily chart, we would like to see the bulls break above the 1.0720 level.   
The green horizontal line @ 1.0617 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it - in the absence of any new and higher swing low - our bullish or upward bias remains intact.  
  
However, in case we have a clearer coast, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels – to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows. Please note that our aim is to buy a dip in today's up-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), we would observe price is still trapped within the downward or bearish channel, which we started observing since the early weeks of this year, 2010. Currently, in an overall bearish trend, the bulls are attempting to break decisively above the channel. Supporting the possibility of the bulls escaping the channel is the recent price-break above the previous day’s high @ 90.13 (not highlighted). However, it’s rather too early to conclude the bulls have finally broken through as the resistance pressure around the upper edge of the bearish channel might eventually subdue them before the close of today’s (also this week’s) trading hours.  
From a day-trade perspective, our bias is bullish, but, based on the analysis above, more conservative traders might prefer to stay off this pair till next week. Less conservative traders might still be able to rely on the H4 price action to make their decisions on whether to seek Long trade setups on the Hourly charts or not.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing high – also yesterday’s high @ 90.13 (which we've highlighted using the blue broken line) upward. That sustains our bias in favor of an upward price move. However, on the H4 chart, we could also observe more clearly price action around the bearish channel discussed on the Daily chart. Price, at the moment, is probably within a resistance-area, hence, there’s the need to be cautious. Again, while less aggressive traders might have to wait till next week to trade this currency pair, more aggressive traders might only wait for a clear H4 candle-close above the resistance confluence of the 90.13 level and the upper edge of the bearish channel.   
The green horizontal line @ 89.56 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it - in the absence of any new and higher swing low - our bullish or upward bias remains intact.  
  
However, in case we have a clearer coast, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels – to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows. Please note that our aim is to buy a dip in today's up-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), we could observe the GBPUSD pair settled into range trading throughout last week. Price hit the lower edge of the downward or bearish channel only to get stalled as the bulls were unable to garner enough momentum to send price back toward the upper edge of the channel. Currently, price is stuck between the most recent Daily swing high @ 1.5763 (which we've highlighted using the upper blue broken line) – on the upper side – and a support confluence of the channel’s lower edge and the year-low @ 1.5533 (which we've highlighted using the lower blue broken line) – on the lower side.   
Consequently, while our day-trade bias leans toward the bulls, we need a clear break above the 1.5763 level to be convinced of the bulls’ resolve to push price northward.  
Also, today is a Bank Holiday in the US, so let’s keep in mind the possibility of thin volume in U.S. trade.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price is yet to break the most recent swing high @ 1.5707 (which we've highlighted using the blue broken line) upward. That buttresses our view that traders are currently indecisive on whether to react to the critical support confluence discussed on the Daily chart and push price northward or succumb to the lingering bearish pressure and continue southward. In all, as also mentioned on the Daily chart, our day-trade bias reluctantly favors the bulls; but we need further confirmation to be more convinced of the bullish retracement.  
The green horizontal line @ 1.5579 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it - in the absence of any new and higher swing low - our bullish or upward bias remains intact.  
  
However, in case of a clearer coast, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels – to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), we would observe traders have been struggling to make a decisive move on the USDJPY pair since late last week when price hit the upper edge of the downward or bearish channel. By the end of yesterday, we had a sign suggesting the channel’s upper edge, as a resistance area, would probably aid the bears to resume their southward journey: yesterday’s candle closed within Friday’s candle – forming a reversal candle pattern (an “inside candle”) in the process, and, as earlier said, that gave us an indication that the bears might resume their activities. In addition, today’s price action has seen the break of yesterday’s low @ 89.90 (not highlighted).  
From a day-trade perspective, our bias has shifted in favor of the bears. Although, the market is relatively sluggish at the moment, the coast seems relatively clear for us to seek Hourly Short trade setups – supported by the H4 chart.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing low – also yesterday’s low @ 89.90 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) downward. That automatically shifts our bias in favor of a downward price move. We could observe, more clearly, price reaction at the upper edge of the bearish channel, which we discussed on the Daily chart: it suggests the resistance-strength the bulls are contending with around the area.  
Also, we could observe the lull-mode the pair has been since yesterday. There’s the possibility of a big break toward either side, but, as earlier said, from a day-trade perspective, our bias is in favor of the bears.  
The white horizontal line @ 90.09 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.   
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), given the time of this posting, it’s not unexpected that traders have already made some decisive moves regarding the direction in which price would go; however, we should still expect more decisions to be made before today’s trading hours close. On the USDJPY, we would observe the bulls are resolved to hold on to their reign despite the pro-bears signals we identified yesterday. Earlier price action today saw price moving decisively above the upper edge of the downward or bearish channel – breaking in the process the previous day’s high @ 90.50 (not highlighted). That suggested to us the bulls now have enough drive to push further northward, at least toward the most recent Daily swing high @ 91.26 (which we've highlighted using the blue broken line).   
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing high @ 90.50 (which we've highlighted using the lower blue broken line) upward. That again shifts our bias in favor of an upward price move. We could observe the critical resistance level @ 91.26 (that we've highlighted using the upper blue broken line), which we discussed on the Daily chart. Please let’s keep the level in mind.  
The green horizontal line @ 89.70 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it - in the absence of any new and higher swing low - our bullish or upward bias remains intact.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels – to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows. Please note that our aim is to buy a dip in today's up-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), as expected yesterday, price continued moving upward to pause around the most recent Daily swing high @ 91.26 (which we've highlighted using the blue broken line). If the 91.26 level happens to be a strong resistance area, we might see the bears forcing price to resume its longer term bearish trend. From a day-trade perspective however, our bias remains in support of the bulls – until we have enough reasons to change our view.  
For now, all we know is: as a result of yesterday’s price activity, the previous day’s candle closed as a very strong bullish candle – breaching the 91.26 resistance level in the process. That suggested to us that the bulls probably have enough momentum to push price further upward. However, since price is yet to break decisively above the 91.26 level, to be convinced of a continued bullish move today, we would prefer to see price-break above the previous day’s high @ 91.36 (not highlighted) before seeking our Hourly long trade setups – supported by the H4 chart.   
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), yesterday, price broke the most recent swing high @ 90.50 (which we've highlighted using the lower blue broken line) upward. That shifted our bias in favor of an upward price move. Again, as with yesterday, we could observe price reaction to the critical resistance level @ 91.26 (that we've highlighted using the upper blue broken line), which we discussed on the Daily chart. Currently, we are seeing signs of a possible bearish move, which might end up becoming a major move – considering the longer term bearish scenario on higher time frame charts. Please let’s keep the level in mind.  
The green horizontal line @ 90.14 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it - in the absence of any new and higher swing low - our bullish or upward bias remains intact.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels – to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows. Please note that our aim is to buy a dip in today's up-trend.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), yesterday, the bulls continued their activity in a very determined manner: after the break of Wednesday’s high @ 91.36 (not highlighted), which resulted in a clear break above the most recent Daily swing high @ 91.26 (that we've highlighted using the blue broken line), as anticipated, price continued its upward movement. Also, early market action today has seen price break above the previous day’s high @ 92.03 (also not highlighted). Consequently, from a day-trade perspective, our bias remains bullish. The next important resistance area we should be monitoring is the upper edge of the symmetrical triangle.  
Today, the coast seems relatively clear enough for us to seek Hourly Long trade setups – supported by the H4 chart.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent Daily swing high @ 91.36 (which we've highlighted using the blue broken line) upward. That sustains our bias in favor of an upward price move.

However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels – to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows. Please note that our aim is to buy a dip in today's up-trend.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), we would observe that on Friday, last week, price hit the upper edge of the upward or bullish channel, and on the same day, it reversed sharply to close as a strong bear-bodied candle. That was a convincing sign that the bulls weren’t prepared to disregard the upper boundary of the bullish channel just yet. Further supporting the possibility of a bearish move toward the lower part of the bullish channel is earlier price action today, which resulted in the break of the previous trading day’s low – Friday’s low @ 1.0747 (not highlighted). Consequently, from a day-trade perspective, our bias has shifted in favor of the bears.   
However, considering price’s proximity to the lower edge of the bullish channel (currently about 50pips away), there’s the need for us to be cautious as we seek Short trade opportunities – especially when we also consider that the USD/CHF currency pair is currently within a medium term bullish trend.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has breached the most recent swing low @ 1.0746 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) downward. That automatically shifts our bias in favor of a downward price move. However, we could notice price is yet to break decisively below the 1.0746 support level, and the last fully formed H4 candle completed the formation of a quasi-reversal candle pattern around the same support level. Hence, we have a sign suggesting a possible bullish retracement.   
In all, while our day-trade bias supports the bears, we should be conscious of the contradictory signals.   
The white horizontal line @ 1.0897 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.   
  
However, in case of a clearer coast, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), in line with what we discussed yesterday, earlier today, price moved further downward toward the lower edge of the upward or bullish channel – breaking the previous day’s low @ 1.0738 (not highlighted) in the process. At the moment, the channel’s lower edge is doing a good job of providing strong support as the bears seem unable to break below it. From a day-trade perspective, our bias is still reluctantly in favor of the bears, but current price actions are telling to be wary of seeking Short trade setups until the coast is clear. Consequently, it’s advisable for us to exercise patience on this currency pair – probably throughout today.

That automatically sustains our bias in favor of a downward price move. However, we could notice the proximity of price to the lower edge of the bullish channel, which we discussed on the Daily chart, and how it’s reacting to the lower edge. It’s quite obvious the bears aren’t having a field day. Again, as advised on the Daily chart, it’s better to abstain from trading this pair until the coast is clear.  
In all, technically speaking, our day-trade bias still supports the bears – albeit reluctantly.   
The white horizontal line @ 1.0787 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), yesterday, the lower edge of the upward or bullish channel eventually proved an insurmountable hurdle for the bears as the initial price-rally was sustained. Consequently, our trading bias, from a day-trade perspective, has again shifted to favor the bulls. However, for us to be convinced of the bulls’ readiness to push price further today, we would like to see the break above the previous day’s high @ 1.0847 (not highlighted).   
In case price breaks above the 1.0847 level, we should expect further unhindered bullish action toward the most recent Daily swing high @ 1.0897 (which we've highlighted using the upper blue broken line).   
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price broke, at that time, the most recent swing high @ 1.0787 (which we've highlighted using the lower blue broken line) upward. That shifted our bias in favor of an upward price move. However, in line with what was discussed on the Daily chart, the most recent swing high – also the previous day’s high @ 1.0847 (which we've highlighted using the upper blue broken line) is a crucial resistance level we would like to see broken for us to be more confident of the bulls’ resolve to sustain their activity.  
The green horizontal line @ 1.0713 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it - in the absence of any new and higher swing low - our bullish or upward bias remains intact.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels – to seek promising areas to take our Long positions.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), yesterday, we anticipated a continued bullish move, but, virtually throughout the earlier trading hours, the bears caused an upset as price swooned. Although our bias, yesterday, from a day-trade perspective was bullish, traders following the analyses on this thread were probably shielded from the sudden price collapse since price didn’t break above the Tuesday’s high (which, yesterday, was a previous day’s high) @ 1.0847.   
Toward the close of yesterday’s trading hours, the bulls regained their momentum – forcing the bears to give up most of their sudden gains. In continuation of the bulls’ resurgence, early price action today has seen the break of both Tuesday’s high and yesterday’s high @ 1.0847 and 1.0841, respectively. Consequently, our bullish bias remains, with the critical resistance level – the most recent Daily swing high @ 1.0897 (which we've highlighted using the upper blue broken line) – still in focus.   
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has broken the most recent swing high @ 1.0847 (which we've highlighted using the blue broken line) upward. That sustains our bias in favor of an upward price move. Again, while seeking Long trade setups on the Hourly chart, let’s keep in mind the 1.0897 resistance level, which we discussed on the Daily chart.   
The green horizontal line @ 1.0737 highlights the most recent swing low, and as long as price stays above it - in the absence of any new and higher swing low - our bullish or upward bias remains intact.  
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important support levels – to seek promising areas to take our Long positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming higher highs and higher lows. Please note that our aim is to buy a dip in today's up-trend.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), for the past one week, price has been trending southward – in agreement with the longer term down trend. Yesterday, price decisively broke below the lower edge of the symmetrical triangle as the trading day ended with a strong bear-bodied candle. As a result, that strengthened the notion that the longer term bearish trend has probably resumed. From a day-trade perspective, our bearish bias remains intact.  
However, there are two critical support levels that we expect price to break below for us to be more confident that the overall bearish trend has resumed: the first is the usual previous day’s low, which, in the case of this currency pair today, is @ 88.79 (not highlighted), and the most recent Daily swing low @ 88.58 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line). For more conservative traders, it’s advisable to avoid seeking Hourly Short trade setups – supported by the H4 chart – till the coast is clear.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price broke, at that time, the most recent swing low @ 89.91 (which we’ve highlighted using the upper blue broken line) downward. That automatically sustained our bias in favor of a downward price move. As discussed on the Daily chart, to be convinced of the bears’ readiness to continue their activity, especially for more conservative traders, it’s preferable to see price break below the most recent swing low – also the previous day’s low @ 88.79 (which we’ve highlighted using the lower blue broken line).   
The white horizontal line @ 90.35 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.   
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

Thanks D liberators, quite a while. Regarding the pips, they haven’t been unruly![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) Have a restful weekend and I wish us all a fulfilling March.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), we would observe price is still within the downward or bearish channel, and there is the likelihood that price would attempt to find its way down toward the lower edge of the channel – especially when we consider the fact that price is in a very strong longer term bearish trend. From a day-trade perspective, our bias favors the bears, and price break below the previous day’s low @ 1.3459 (not highlighted) earlier today gives more credence to the bias.   
However, price is around the most recent Daily swing low @ 1.3450 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line), and it seems the bears are currently struggling to break decisively below the support level. It would be preferable to wait for the close of today’s candle to be surer of where price might be heading next.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), price has breached the most recent swing low @ 1.3459 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) downward. That automatically sustains our bias in favor of a downward price move. However, to buttress the support hurdle the bears are contending with around the 1.3450 level, which we discussed on the Daily chart, price is struggling to break decisively below the most recent H4 swing low @ 1.3459 that we just mentioned above.  
In all, our Daily bias still favors the bears, but we need to be very cautious if we attempt to seek Short trade setups, today, on this currency pair.   
The white horizontal line @ 1.3653 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.   
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.  
  
Also, PATIENCE is the key here: we need to patiently wait for the Hourly retracement. It might happen, and it might not.

**On the Daily chart** (attached), we would observe price is in a symmetrical triangle formation. Yesterday, the bulls attempted to break above the upper edge of the triangle but were forced to retreat as they found themselves around a very strong resistance-confluence area of the upper edge of the triangle and the year-high @ 1.0897 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line). Consequently, yesterday’s candle closed as bear-bodied reversal candle pattern.  
From a day-trade perspective, our bias has shifted in favor of the bears. However, price is currently around the lower edge of the symmetrical triangle, and there’s the possibility of the bears experiencing some challenges in their attempt to break decisively below the triangle. Hence, while our daily bias favors the bears, let’s keep the triangle’s lower edge in mind as we seek Hourly Short trade setups – supported by the H4 chart.  
  
**On the H4 chart**(attached), earlier today, price slightly breached the most recent swing low @ 1.0719 (which we’ve highlighted using the blue broken line) downward. That automatically shifted our bias in favor of a downward price move. However, to buttress the support hurdle the bears are contending with around the lower edge of the symmetrical triangle, which we discussed on the Daily chart (and seen on the H4 chart), we would observe that price is yet to break decisively below the 1.0719 level. Consequently, the 1.0719 level – in agreement with the lower edge of the triangle – could still be considered a support level that the bears must break below decisively for their resolve to be ascertained.   
In all, our Daily bias still favors the bears, the white horizontal line @ 1.0886 highlights the most recent swing high, and as long as price stays below it – in the absence of any new and lower swing high – our bearish or downward bias remains intact.   
  
However, we still need our Hourly charts – using Fibonacci retracement levels and important resistance levels – to seek promising areas to take our Short positions. Price pattern on the Hourly must also be forming lower highs and lower lows. Please note that our aim is to sell a rally in today’s down-trend.
