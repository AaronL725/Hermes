Hey Folks.  
  
Checkout the basic rule here - [Here](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=8775527#post8775527). Don't post there, only top down analysis, you are most welcome there with your analysis Bones will then give you a better picture of it what he is best at ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f647-200d-2642-fe0f.png?v=15.1)  
  
If It works for you do give a thumbs up, IuI will create a **detailed post,** covering almost everything even some great free resource, by the end of the coming week, will start from 25th, I seek help from anyone of you good at explaining. Which I guess I'm not at all ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f923.png?v=15.1) pm me ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)gw

**One thing please note, just don't copy anyone's signal blindly, do your own research and have confidance, in my early days 90% of the time price turned in favor of me after I was stopped out only because of false info, now those are not false its just how they look into it. They have a plan and they stick to it (professionals), don't just make your 3 rule buy sell signal, have some creativity to find out patterns, draw some fibb's etc., it may not work at the begining but it will pay off. I may take some trades early or late, I can afford to lose people new to this game can't so stick with the rules, you can post your setups and entry here, pros will appreciate and criticize for good. I may not be available here till thursday, I hope you will keep this thread active,**

Today's Example 80 pips +, I do analysis on longer TF before considering a trade, I use this strategy for my entry and ride the trend, what's important is what's your Exit strategy, be precise and stick with it.

Hey buddy, I think you have not gone through the rules. Anyway just to recap you need to switch to lower ft for the entry say you got a setup on4h chart switch to 1hr and when the price breaks all the ema's enter into the trade look the above example.  
  
Hope it helps

**Folks please go through the rules before posting, otherwise it seems you only want to get eyeballs for your profile. It is not a buy sell system where you enter the market when the stoch turns red or blue you need to switch to the lower time frame for the entry when price breaks all the Ema's, HERE IS AN EXAMPLE HOW THIS SYSTEM COULD HAVE KEPT YOU OUT OF A LOOSING TRADE, MAYBE A WINNER LATER.**

Indeed, but it requires vast knowledge and lot of experience which I smell you have, certainly I have no plans to make my future in this finance world, I just trade to pay off my bills and to live a peaceful life and sometimes even to fulfill my desire which I'm unable to with my day job.

hello,  
  
I am not posting in that thread for 2 reason:  
  
1st because I am always busy with my job as a doctor which is really more difficult than forex trading,and secondly since of lack of interest in my posts from other fellow traders.  
  
Wish you success

Closed the trade with a small profit 10 pips as it does not looks good to me, but initially it gave a 60 pips move after the entry. See where the price is Daily 200 EMA, its ranging their since past 4 days.

The setup looks good, but you entered way too early, the rule is to enter when the price breaks all ema's on the next lower TF which in this case is 1hr and I would rather enter 5 pips bellow the close of the candle .  
  
  
  
Looking forward to see more trades by you

Here's the chart,  Folks you are not showing any interest on this thread, WHEN SOMETHING IS FREE AND GOOD don't forget to thank I make enough to   
  
live happily, I am not selling you anything. If you all are not interested Let me   
  
know and I 'll ask moderators to   
  
Delete this thread,   
  
Don't Judge a book by its cover. Trust me I know there are few fellows who are  
  
struggling to make money, have lost their fortune gambling, I never thought to  
  
post this strategy, but remembered those days when I use to come to this forum   
  
to just see a high impact member posting something positive about the pair I was   
  
loosing miserably, trust me this strategy can make you a fortune stress free .  
  
I posted this strategy here because this is the community for which I stand today, money is nothing to me but the feeling I get when a guy says it made him his living through this strategy is top of the world, I could have even started a thread in the commercial section and could have asked for $97 per two weeks, showing you my live account, and trading with the same strategy, i'm pretty sure i would have been getting better response then this thread. and If I would had done that I bet you could not have resisted yourself then of subscribing. I wrote this because I saw 150 + downloads but very few bothered to say a thanks. Now I would not be excited anymore for this thread, I wish you luck and success, and Yes I make f*in amount of money using this strategy, and I mean it.

Hello,  
  
Don't get mad or sulk, I expect most people, like me, will look at the charts, do some back and forward testing to fully evaluate the system for themselves. What I mean by this is that your system works for you but it may not for for others because they are not suited to the system.  
  
I hope that your strategy continues to work well for you.  
  
Best of luck. 

One against the many.

both the two pairs could go further down, but I closed it 95 pips+ both combined, I am already done for this week, I just took this trade to show you people as I have to prepare for a major work on Tuesday had to close this, can't prepare having trades on.   
  
But did you guys noticed how the price moved after the entry, at a go stress free and it gave you a precise SL that you don't have to chase, if it turns against you. that's the power of this system, this gives you the ability which most of the traders desire for, just to watch the trade going in their favor just after they enter and have the same feeling without having to get some herbs ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Reason, why I took the cad trade. attached  
  
Tip: not promoting but insist you to use [FOREX.COM](/brokers/forexcom "View FOREX.com Broker Profile")'s mt4 platform for your analysis, Personally I feel their candles are best out their, but its only for analysis you can use any broker for trading live.

I don't know if the creator gonna find me and shoot me for distributing his indicator, but I really don't care. Here you go friends, the one I feel the best, stay in the trade until it changes its color to its opposite side on the lower TF , and I won't be putting this post's link on the main thread those who will read it will use it.

By the way I have some questions, I will be very glad if you answer me. 1. I am not a rich man, so can you tell me how much will be the minimum equity to be a successful trader here. ( Lot size 0.01) 2. Which pair do you think is the most suitable one for this trading system? 3. Trading hour? Kindly do understand me if my questions are too stupid. Remember I am a newbie ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) Thanks in advance.

You need not to be rich to use this strategy, I do like to grow small account grow larger, I trade on bigger account just to make decent income, here's the SS to support my statement, the balance is right now 371.81 and this week I made 279 so that equals 92 starting equity. and that too I did not took all the trades as I already told you I'm running busy for my presentation. Have at least to execute your orders. but don't over trade or revenge trade  
  
Any pair I get the entry. and no trading hours 24/5

wow! Varun, thank you so much! As someone here said we are lucky to be with you. Many claimed gurus here in FF never shared their so called holygrail because they afraid it will become a losing strategy soon. they just keep posting their journal just to brag themselves but you are different. One question, since you are looking your analysis on 4H chart, that mean you can only have 1 trade par day per pair? Do you trade how many pairs at the same time?Many Thanks!

Thanks Mario, for your kind words, touched indeed. Now I could not exactly understand what you mean but I get enough entries, the entire week and pretty much I trade every pair I get an entry. Just a tip don't get excited when you get an entry do your analysis on bigger Tfs, have some economic point of view and must take a note what other traders thing for about the pair, the best places I feel are FF, trading views, forexmentorpro they guys really share some amazing analysis every week at a price of burger. Note I am no where affiliated to any of them, it's just my personal view what I do and suggest you. if yo do this you will have extra confidence which will give you a winning trade.

Thank you very much for sharing your account history with us. It helps me a lot. I will try with my demo for a day, i.e on Monday, and if I get a good result I will go for my real account ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
Again, I am very grateful to you for your generosity. Have a great day.  
  
Oh by the way, I just want to ask you one thing.. You have also a Bollinger band strategy?

Hi V,  
  
Thank you kindly for sharing your wisdom and expertise. The system looks great, and congratulations on your success thus far. I have not traded for a while as I was one of those traders that eventually blew up 3 accounts, I have given forex a break for a while. however, this seems like a great strategy so I will practise on simulator and hope I can eventually trade live and be successful with it.  
  
Thank you once again for sharing your profitable strategy  
  
Best regards

> {quote} Thanks Mario, for your kind words, touched indeed. Now I could not exactly understand what you mean but I get enough entries, the entire week and pretty much I trade every pair I get an entry. Just a tip don't get excited when you get an entry do your analysis on bigger Tfs, have some economic point of view and must take a note what other traders thing for about the pair, the best places I feel are FF, trading views, forexmentorpro they guys really share some amazing analysis every week at a price of burger. Note I am no where affiliated...

Hi Varun ,I am looking at your system looks good ,sound tech with some indicators ,  
something tells me you have a lot to offer ,I'm not talking about that great pip result shown   
  
Please bear with me MT4 is not something I use nor indicators other than bollinger ,

Hi varun76   
Thanks for your thread  
  
l subscribed/ downloaded your template  
  
Will give a try...  
  
You are talking about rules before entries...What are they exactly...read everything...didn't see them clearly.... a step by step walkthrough for dummies ( kind of checklist) from Market prospection to the trade trigger.... would help me see the big picture...l see your pics as examples but l do not know what is the sequence of your actions...  
Can you remind me the purpose of color stochastic? are arrows related to this?  
You say you pay bill with forex does that means that system brings you consistency enough to do so?  
Looking for consistency for months without success...still searching...  
  
Thanks for your help

Hey Bones,  
  
Bb is not actually required, the way I will look the chart is,  
  
1\. there is a setup to short on D tf but on 4hr the price never broke the MA'S (ss 1 and 2)  
2.But on 4hr TF we got a setup to go long from the moment the color stoch goes bellow 30 (ss 3 )  
3\. switching to lower tf which is 1hr we would wait for all the mas to cross  
  
For Sell setup we will look for the price to create LL and LH and we would look for a setup to go short on LH how we will know its LH is when the price remains bellow the previous LH and the stoch crosses 70 lvl  
For Buy setup we will look for the price to create HH and HL and would look for a setup to go long on HL how we will know its HL is when the price remains above the previous HL stoch is bellow 30  
  
Hope it helps Master ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

It depends, not always. I really don't have an exact answer for you, sometimes its weekly levels sometimes its 200 Ema or sometimes its just a bb reversal bar.  
  
Hope it helps.

Hey Ben,   
  
You're welcome, Well, I try to make things as much clear as I can, still I will try to make it better next week, arrows are nothing and for consistency you need to figure it out yourself, so far it worked like a charm for me, I am sure it will work the same for you too ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

76,  
  
If you want to get rid of the arrows you just need to go to the color stochastic properties and put "false" for show arrows.   
  
If you want to get the arrows to correspond to the stochastic, then in Color Stochastic properties just change 80 & 20 to 70 & 30\.

Hey Varun,  
  
I kind of liked your attitude and willingness to share your system with the folks out there.  
I have subscribed and am in the process of understanding the steps.  
I have a request. would you list out the indicators with settings and time frames that you use for your setup ?  
This alone will be a big help to anyone starting on your thread. Thanks a lot again.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Thanks a lot again.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Good setup of your indicators. It captures price action quite well. Welcome to the factory!

Hi V. When you say money management was prettypretty aggresive. Exactly how aggressive? Any single trade risking up to 10-25% of your account? Also in your current trade explorer, how are your measuring the number of lots to enter on each trade, or is it random?

Hi Varun!  
  
First of all thank you for sharing your system! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
As a newbie I have a question for you, because I can't open your tpl file properly - I need to know what EMAs do you use in your system, so I can set it up manually. Can you please share this info with us? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Was it tested also on the lower timeframes, like M15/M5, M5/M1? Do you have any data to prove that the system works there too?  
  
And the last question, if I may ask - how much time do you spend before a computer screen to catch those signals? I cannot wait to test it myself, but I have a job schedule that allows me to trade only after 5-6 PM of my local time for a two, max three hours. I just want to know if I can use it too in my circumstances.  
  
Once again, thank you for your contribition to the community!

Suspect the timing of entries and stops on this is a bit more usable for most people psychologically.  
  
It's worth having a good read of that thread too, some good stuff in there.

I never had much DD, a tip I can give close the trade when it turns against you I determine this when the candle on 4hr closes above or bellow heiken 5 pips bellow or above the candle close and thenlookfor a reentry it will give you maximum profit with minimum risk, I will elaborate it in comming days .

You gave me a great Lesson, In case of sell If we draw fibbo from Previous Lh to new LL, and from new LL to NEW Lh (Which can be determined after the break of MA'S ) we get a more clearer picture of exactly what to to. though I used it in a bit differently. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1) ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f973.png?v=15.1)

Trade Setup. If Ma's are broken  
  
GBPCHF  
GBPJPY  
EURJPY as Swamp posted it already  
GBPNZD Looks interesting  
Eurgbp we have a setup on 4h but look the weekly chart avoid such trades   
Eurnzd looks great   
  
Now, I may take some of the trade early or late depending on my trading style. Also I know some the pairs are just overbought and over sold but have given a setup I urge you look for entry, It won't if it has to go the other way, that's the power of this system  
  
Off to family, Catch you later

Varun mate no need to delete the thread. I have a friend who isn't doing well career wise and I tried to teach him how to trade but after a week he lost interest even though he needs something in his life or it's going down the shitter. The thread will help those who truly want it.

There are lots of good strategy in FF, but they all create long times ago.  
Although the TS still support their thread, hard to follow and read them since strategy and indis are change and most of them have hundres page of thread.  
  
This is quite new strategy, subscribed and will try to stay here and follow..

Have you thought about helping him get a real job or help him make a career change that actually works?  
It sounds like your friend is wiser than you think because "he lost interest"

Quite the contrary Ming. FX is a great way to build wealth for those with the aptitude and fortitude to learn to trade skillfully. Unfortunately this can only be learned with practice on taking good entries and study on proper money management.

Unfortunately, that is totally unproven and I challenge you to find even one "trader at home" who is "building wealth" with forex.  
It's obvious that even a minimum wage job will make more money long term than any venture into retail forex trading.  
They are far more people "building wealth" with a real job than there ever will be with retail forex (actually, they are not any, if there were any it would not be just hearsay, or rumor or what some people claim on websites such as this one)

It is not a buy sell system where you enter the market when the stoch turns red or blue you need to switch to the lower time frame for the entry when price breaks all the Ema's, HERE IS AN EXAMPLE HOW THIS SYSTEM COULD HAVE KEPT YOU OUT OF A LOOSING TRADE, MAYBE A WINNER LATER.

I still read page 1,  
Pls help me understand this, @Varun :  
  
So, based on the pictures on quoted post, we waiting for the price on AUDCHF h4 is below (break) all the EMAs to go sell ? or, forget it all if the price on H4 is keep go up..  
\-----  
  
Another thing, from the 1st post, you said EMAs, but when the template applied, the MAs are SMA..  
for me, its make an impact since price still above MA if I use SMA, but when EMA used, the price is below the MA.  
Pls confirm..  
  
thanks V..

Captain Jack is one. Copernicus, bassramy, North Trader, FX Jay are a few. Al Brooks is another if you need someone who has written a book.  
  
Edit: And I would add the OP to the list. When you learn to read the charts, you will immediately see who is making money. Or at least has their entries down.

@Mingary !  
  
I see you are even a "yellow" member. I'm completely mystified: why did you post here at this website 2732 posts (so far) about fx trading ? If you are convinced of the absurdity of all the retail forex activities people are providing here and otherwhere you should better sail away ? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f937-200d-2642-fe0f.png?v=15.1)

It only proves - and it's a fact - that it's possible to make some money, some of the time. (Even I can do it ..)  
But it's never consistent.

> @Mingary ! I see you are even a "yellow" member. I'm completely mystified: why did you post here at this website 2732 posts (so far) about fx trading ? If you are convinced of the absurdity of all the retail forex activities people are providing here and otherwhere you should better sail away ? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f937-200d-2642-fe0f.png?v=15.1) Hmmm ... oh no: I understand you think perhaps you could (or must) even be a missionary fighting against the antichrist ! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f647-200d-2642-fe0f.png?v=15.1)

Yes bro ! You are indeed a brilliant fellow Chrsitian ... wasting his time ... undeviatingly fighting against the black forces (of forex trading) ! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f64f.png?v=15.1)  
  
P.S.: Now you have already 2735 (!) posts here - I think they all are missionary posts ? Well done bro ! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1) ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f923.png?v=15.1)

I do like your posts from time to time as it does put a grim view of things in the minds of retail traders to at least make them aware of the perils they are facing. I must admit, the optimistic carefree note of many of this forum irrits me as but generalities aside, why do you feel it is necessary to continuously inhabit this space and be the omen of bad tidings? If it is a sense of responsibility to help out the poor suffering retail trader, then don't bother or at least give it a rest and share some of the more positive ways that you trade or in your view maybe gamble, as obviously you are a player.  
  
However have you ever considered that perhaps you may be just too black and white in your verdict. You are familiar with probabilities in this game and to concede a 100% certainty is a strikingly absurd viewpoint no matter what position you hold about this game.  
  
For well capitalised traders or FM's who trade in the forex space using OPM, do you really think that it is all whistling in the wind. Do we disregard the audited returns of the successful active FM's who may have allocated a portion of their capital into forex as simply gamblers and can be found on sites such as[ IASG](http://www.iasg.com/) etc?  
  
Do returns of these managers of say 10% per annum (after fees) with perhaps drawdowns exceeding say 40% every so often over say 20-30 years imply luck or skill. If you assess any business venture, ROI of 10% per annum pre-tax with major drawdowns in equity is standard fare and for a business that has survived 10 or more years or so is regarded as a solid performer. Why pounce on forex as if it is any different to other industry sectors or segments. Furthermore, it is simple prudence which makes a trader consider investing in other sources of income to supplement the volatility of returns. It is no weakness to look for alternate sources of income to supplement the game. That is simply wise business practice.  
  
If this is an argument regarding whether or not the market is random walk, then let's have it. To simply state that no-one is successful in this space is simply a doggedly obstinate stance that is counterproductive to the intent of this forum and the positive collaboration we need as retail traders to battle in this very tough game. What gives?

You must understand: your EA isn't "wrong", presumably it is good and well _**coded**_ ! The point is: you never ever can't include into your code the Price Action defined actions of a Manual Trader ! There are zillions of EAs out based on the so called "mechanical" principles. They mostly fail sooner or later in extrem market situations. None of the EAs can beat the experience of a good manual trader ! To find a working EA is a long long journey ! So you may right and proper code any EA ... it's a possible but hard way to success in forex.

I agree too![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) we get enough entries with any system but not all are winners its us who can make all the trades winner and not an EA, I read somewhere here in FF that a good trader can profit even if everyone trading against his sentiments. Think about it, we should not let robots overtake us or else the world will get destroyed.

Lovely poem. Hard to have favourites but that was what Dad used to read to me before bedtime.  
  
That BBC doco has me cringing. I see where you are coming from. Critical reasoning appears a lost endeavour. What a sad state of affairs but still not enough to abandon hope (in fellow man).

Thank you, I wish you the same but I don't understand what you are fighting for in cricket stadium Cricketers play cricket mt4 is our stadium and we are traders, no team wins all the match neither we, they do hard work to prepare them self, to become skillful , well we just don't put trades either way our brain wants.  
  
I wish you success and request you to stop fighting, every person has its own perception, we work hard our butt off , winning or loosing is then a destiny. Go with the flow my friend. Don't let your life lead you, you lead your life.

hi varun  
I finally find a strategy with the same principle as mine

also w-d-h4  
  
two examples

Bit busy, will explain it later just if you can figure out from the image, there is no trade setup just imagine you entered the green marked candle, let the 4hr candle close above or bellow Heiken put sl few pips above or bellow , note the blue mark is not a valid heiken break for me, if you will put it you're sl there, often it will happen your sl getting hit and the then the price turns in favor of you and creates new low or high, now never put a sl with your prediction, I repeat never just to be safe place your first sl 100 -150 pips and keep checking every 4hr, now heiken may may be different with differentr brokers, I use [Forex.com](/brokers/forexcom "View FOREX.com Broker Profile") and alpari. forex.com gives best candle and alpari gives me best pattern, now I cannot exactly make you understand what I mean by that sentence I will cover it later, now I apologize for the punctuation, I am getting disturbed by some disturbing elements of my home I guess you got it. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1) I will explain it in a much better and detailed way after this week.

Now this is for new comers, if you could just remember few patterns it would be enough to make a living, on 24th I posted 300 pips up so far, no show off it may have turned against me but it didn't, WHEN YOU SEE SUCH EXAMPLE INSTEAD OF SETUP you are more eager to learn. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/270c-fe0f.png?v=15.1)

Hey 76 the most imporant lesson i learnt was to wait and let the trades come your way .. we all go through the phase of chasing trades but generally i work the same with the 34 sma and look for the price action either above or below the 34 sma - with stochastics showing an up move which is logical. Going to post some setups when looking at the pound dollar which i trade most expecting one more low and a rebound around NYC time for Monday.  
  
Heres a Euro chart - marked the sell position with the arrows - price went above the trend lines OK happens lots right, but when price broke the 34 sma then that was my sell - if you look at the chart as of now you can see where price is in relation to the trendlines and the 34 sma - as i said i prefer to wait for the set ups to come to me .. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Heres the Pound dollar as new traders always need to see charts - same method note the arrows marked and the price in relation to the 34 sma .. and in the trendline zone. Again now we are waiting for the price to come to us .. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

first i appreciate for this great thread varun. I was looking for a system like this which is a long term trade. I read the thread and go through the market to find some positions. I think trading on EURGBP might be good based on your strategy. please give me your feedback.

Exactly But I would be cautious for this one, when you get an entry do switch to bigger TF you might get some no for it which will save you. Its more likely to fall the system won't give you an entry

On both charts price has now moved above the trendline and so logically we now wait and see how the price comes towards us and if it stays in that direction for the trade.

"4th - Make sure their is separation of 5,3,3 stock for a better confirmation and try to avoid trades if the price breaks 200 ma in 1hr chart and the other Ma's are above it as in case of sell and vise versa, Cadjpy example explains better" could you please explain this?

I know that most posters here are only trying to help, but EAs, different chart settings, different MAs, disregard of indicators, etc. are all contrary to V's method.  
If he is happy for this to occur and for his method to change, then so be it, but I find there are a myriad of systems anyone can use but I liked this one as presented by V. I have subscribed to this thread and find it irksome to sift through posts not related to the original method.  
Once again, I mean no offense to anyone, just prefer a cleaner thread and if V is happy for all these extra inputs, then I wil ltolerate it because I like the system and V's outlook.  
Cheers

Sorry if I come across as grumpy, but I've seen too many threads become diluted and changed from the original idea and would like this one to run a little longer as is if possible

Not a second to come and chat to you guys, just came to say somewhere I agree Swamp, No disrespect, even a blank chart means lot to me ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) its just that I too feel confused on other thread when I see some other method apart from the initial thread idea, I loved Dean's idea so much but it would be just better if it could be on the thread's chart tlp. again no disrespect it's just that the more complex we make with some pro's theory which I admire the more people will lose interest, I insist you to use attach'd tlp and thread's initial rule rule along with your theory. may be the same but with this chart.   
  
  
To everyone ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f647-200d-2642-fe0f.png?v=15.1) for thinking to help other's ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

In 1Hour Chart, I think, this is not time to enter into the trade because of the oversold condition showed by the schotastics. What do you think V?

If he is happy for this to occur and for his method to change, then so be it, but I find there are a myriad of systems anyone can use but I liked this one as presented by V. I have subscribed to this thread and find it irksome to sift through posts not related to the original method.

I said I didn't mean any offense, but I guess some people can't help it. An explanation might have helped because I can't see anything unreasonable in what I posted.  
I'll definitely read with interest if he ever starts his own thread, though!

The system is simple and effective, I've tested it live with EJ entry last night and the outcome was good, and you have a very positive atitude.

Hi Varun 76,  
Nice thread, another good way to go with trend on pullbacks... plain and clear ...  
But what scares me is tremendous risk you are taking ...  
Initial risk you are taking is extremely high, even 20% of your account per trade.... calculated based on your explorer average trade risk and this is around 0,2% per pip, average (maximum was 0,36%/pip)..  
So SL of 50 pips makes 10% of account value per trade .... is it because of small testing account, or SL is just an air bag to save account live?  
Don't you think showing such high risk to FF members you ar showing that fast track to get rich is quite possible? Could you elaborate a little about this, please?   
Green pips varun76....

Hey B,  
  
The TE SL as you said is just an airbag, and I don't consider this even my live account, this is my play money, I have already told the new folks out there to not copy my trade I may enter and exit anytime I take calculated risk this is my play money, people get more inspire from good result, I suggest you to follow strict rules and MM it will benifit you, I take a lot more trade leaving this system aside may be a counter a bb strategy harmonic etc I will cover this all later.

Thats why I say not to copy anyone's suggestion blindly I took it it moved 50 pips in favor of me I was not there to trail it by the time I reached by my laptop it was negative 50 pips I guess, and clossed it and start looking for new trades, if you would have copied it through my TE, and still holding thinking it will hit tp chances are you would be wondering if the price will go up now.

BTW, I suggest to wait, SELL signal is better with USDJPY at this time.

Never hope. As soon as you are wrong, get out.

Today, I saw this thread. I have gone through it thoroughly.  
I think I have understood the wisdom of this strategy. It looks great and promissing.  
Many thanks to you Varun.  
  
This is my first contribution in this site. I will be looking at some currency couples and try to identify the ones that show the required pattern and post them in the thread.  
  
Thanks again for your great strategy and information.

Varun,  
Your strategy is really amazing. But it's only a part of my system.  
I have included your strategy as a filter, to cut out bad trades.  
So that, you can see some trades has been opened sooner, and some trades has not been sent even your strategy say it's a valid signal.  
I will post an example here ASAP when I have.  
  
About my system, it's hard to explain with just some posts. Maybe I will explain about it later.

@ Everyone...  
Here is an example of failed signal.  
AUDUSD  
If you enter market with a SELL at stop sign I placed in M30, at least until now (for 7 hours) you still in loss. Ofcouse nobody know what will be later ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1).

Correct D,  
  
But this is the when human use their visuals and brain which Ea's can't, may be you can develop an algorithm for it, You're great BDW ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1) Also, I don't prefer anything less then 4 hr, this won't be in case of 4hr even if very rare but too often with 1 hr.  
  
God Bless you

Thanks for your kindly words!  
Sometime, I saw a valid signal, but I shy... I do not enter market. Sometime, like God tell me take in even signal very risky...  
So that, I still get hard to develop an algorithm to control everything.  
  
Anyway, today so sweet to begin...  
20%+ growing within a day, with very low drawdown.  
Highly suggest everyone take a look at this thread.

Standard Android MT4 on my smartphone. I wish I could be home all day on pc with heiken indis, but this system seems simple enough so far.You're right, I do like risk, but happy to take small losses and compound winners when I can ☺

SELL signal confirmed.  
BTW, AUDNZD already going to OverSold and maybe not go down for a while.  
On another hand, I think AUDNZD going to UpTrend at this time.  
Just my 2 cents, let's see where it going to...  
=====  
EURCHF SELL signal on H1, confirmed by M30, followed longterm DownTrend H4 and D1

Price never reached 5 pips below signal candle, so no valid entry given yet. Safe system if the rules are followed 😅

1st of all, Varun Thank you so much for sharing your system ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f917.png?v=15.1)  
  
If I can get this to work, it is soooo much simpler than Paradox ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
Could actually trade on Android.  
  
Here was a chart that I did _not_ trade, since the 10,3,3 was already below 70 when I saw it. (Right?)  
Also the HLs on H1 made it look risky.

It was a mistake to use HA candles. Will use regular next time.

Learning is a process which never ends, even I'm not perfect don't judge me with my TE I may make 1000's of pips today but may also lose thrice of it the very next day, what matters the most is are we doing are best or not, before you take any trade go through all the tf I bet most of the time you will find one think which will stop you from taking that trade and ask your self "Am I gambling" you will get a reply, I bet you will, which only you can hear. Take fx as cricket, players sometimes score centuries and sometimes get out within the 1st over, can you say, if they are professionals how they got out, ask any badge member in this forum even if they have lost a single trade or not, you will find no one, can you say they are bad traders.  
  
What makes them great is their consistency, willingness to be in the game and sticking to the rules they made, I'm sure you understand and learn from few loosing trades. Never give up. Keep learning.

USD/JPY got me -14 pips but E/J went for +116. I'm trying to stay conservative and ride the trends. I'm currently watching GBP/CHF for a short, and maybe a re-entry short with USD/JPY but its looking iffy.

Mr Varun  
  
Good to see your great trade results and setups. Its a noble thing that you are sharing all this with other people. I had a query please. Can you show me any one of the charts of the above taken live trades that are open right now? GBPUSD, EURGBP or any you want. Because im trying to follow this strategy but cant find the price obeying your rules on 4 hour chart but you are opening trades. So im confused a bit about what is going on.  
  
Looking forward to your kind help ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Yes my friend ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1) , might effect more on the smaller TF , I trade only H4 and D1 too ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f918.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1) but trying to avoid on any Hight Impact news, got bad history with it ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f62d.png?v=15.1)

Hello Porfirio,  
  
Can you please give your view on the CADJPY pair?  
  
I am still awaiting the EG trade for a buy? Wait till in 1hr PA closes > 50 and 200 MA. Great if we can ignore the news.  
  
Thanks

@ Everybody: I suggest to use maximum lots 0.05 with every margin 1000.  
You can keep a bigger room for bad signal come back into profit before get a MARGIN CALL...

I noticed V said in post [#122](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=8781147#post8781147) "we wait for all the MAs to cross" (on H1). They seem to be out-of-order in your picture...

Yes he did say that but entry is 5 pips after a candle closes on other side of the mas ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) Also, Sigill for me atleast when the stoch reaches 70 the trade is on even if it falls from those levels. I just use it as a guide to let me know price has swung up, then I'm on 1hour for entry short unless price continues up and passes the previous high. Not sure what the others think tho.

that makes sense. He said "must be above" and then "[not] without _going_ above", so it must be flexible. thanks

Don't know how you quickly check 49+ pairs,  
but I made a script to scan them all, and list the ones that meet this criteria:

  1. 10,3,3 stoch is above 70 on current TF and price is below 200 EMA on lower TF, **or**
  2. 10,3,3 stoch is below 30 on current TF and price is above 200 EMA on lower TF.

That eliminates the vast majority that can't be traded, as per rules.  
Just put in 'MQL4\scripts\' folder and run on any H4 chart.  
  
Maybe you guys have a better method.

It displays less alerts because it does not display the same group of alerts twice.. (thus , there is a "removal", there is less traffic)

It does not look so.. Extract from the doc:  
  
>>>In MQL4 the comparison of strings is performed on the level of operators using "==". Interesting is the fact that comparison is case-dependant, i.e. strings "STRING" and "string" are different: <<

I know that the preferable TF it is h4 with h1, however this trade looks good for this Daily with h4, I took a smaller PS for that.  
Disregard the TP it is just for orientation.  
Any opinions?

I think your setup was backwards.  
  
V's system trades with the trend not against it.  
  
So in a downtrend you're looking for an upward corrective wave A-B-C ending with stoch overbought (>70) -- so you can ride it back down when price breaks the MAs on your lower TF.

As per my understanding of this system, here is the entry rules. Kindly correct me if I make a mistake.  
  
TF; 1H & 4H Only  
PAIR : Any PAIR  
  
Long :  
In 1H and in 4H chart  
Price > all three moving averages in the template provided by V  
Stock Slow and fast are below 20  
( Have to watch Daily Pivot too)  
  
Short : Vice versa

I've only been regarding the MAs for entry on the H1. Price action and Stochastic reversal on H4. Maybe V can clarify?☺

Just some words to more clear...  
TF use HigherTF/LowerTF: D1/H4, H4/H1 (I also use H1/M30)  
On HigherTF: in the template provided by V Stock Slow and fast are below 20 (I also use when Stoch below 30)  
On LowerTF: chart Price > all three moving averages in the template provided by V  
_Any filter maybe included if you fell more effects (I used)._

So that means this slow stoch and fast stoch can be looked over while looking for an entry in a lower TF like 30,1h?

> Don't know how you quickly check 49+ pairs, but I made a script to scan them all, and list the ones that meet this criteria: **\- 10,3,3 stoch is above 70 on current TF and price is below 200 EMA on lower TF, or - 10,3,3 stoch is below 30 on current TF and price is above 200 EMA on lower TF.**

Because I am lazy, I wanted the script to automatically generate a profile with the charts (pairs that meet those criteria).

  1. DLLs must be enabled.
  2. Place in \MQL4\**scripts** \ and make sure your Dynamite.tpl is installed in \templates\
  3. The first time you run it, you have to reboot MT4 for it to see the new profile.
  4. It can only update the profile if you have a DIFFERENT profile loaded (not the generated one). So just _switch to another, run it, & switch back_.
  5. Small glitch: you have to close the gen'd charts manually before updating the profile, otherwise the old ones stick around. Can try 2 fix if ppl care

Here you go. This version is to be run as an _Indicator_ , and assumes your MT4 email settings are correct.

  1. Lower CPU usage than previous versions. (Checks at lower TF bar close, instead of every tick.)
  2. Customize lower TF, alert & email settings -- disabled by default.
  3. Reports "New" and "Unchanged" pairs separately.
  4. Is totally silent if nothing new.

Rushed to get this out so testing was very basic. Will update if any issues.

I cannot find any obvious bugs in his code -- it looks very well done.  
BUT I can almost guarantee it will **not** be profitable, and we should focus on learning Manual.  
  
For one, it is missing some components:

  1. does not evaluate _long_ -term trend (e.g. D1).
  2. does not check for _good separation_ on the 5,3,3.
  3. does not wait for market to move _5 pips_ beyond close of signal bar -- very important!
  4. does not avoid news times (lowering Spread limit might help).
  5. does not look at session/pair liquidity cycles.
  6. does not evaluate strength of retracement -- in case trend is reversing?
  7. uses a hard trailing stop, instead of [Heiken Matrix](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=8779668#post8779668).
  8. I might set ZigZag Length=5 instead of 12, but it would _depend on market condition_.

For two,

Stoch turns and MA bounces on lower TFs seem to be good places to reenter on strong moves ☺

Take care when you **SELL** GBPAUD  
1/ OverSold for long time, on almost high TF.  
2/ Strong support reached, price is lowest for very long time (From May2015 until now)

**glitch** : you have to close the gen'd charts manually before updating the profile, otherwise the old ones stick around.  
~~BUG: First matched pair doesn't show up. E.g. if there are 5 prospective pairs, it makes charts for 4 of them.~~  
  
Bug fixed. If you use the old version, you will be missing 1 chart each time. so sorry

~~Watching U/NOK for a long signal~~. **edit:** 32 pip spread?? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f633.png?v=15.1)  
Watching E/J for a short signal.  
  
Also watching A/CAD for short, but both H1 stochs are oversold, so I would be afraid to risk it.

It was encouraging for me to see this trade & think it was good, and then see V took it & lost.  
  
The past 24h reminds me that success is not trading perfection, it is trading probability.  
Losses are guaranteed.  
  
That said, maybe there were warning signs  
1) The 5,3,3 on H4 was going the wrong way?  
2) Zooming out the H4 chart, it looked like the trend was weakening, and LTT might be going sideways, not continuing.  
**edit:** 3) On some brokers, price did not reach 5 pips from the breaking candle close, so it was not an entry per rules.  
  
But for V I see those weren't good reasons to hesitate. There is always risk.

I set a pending order and it was never triggered, still waiting on it.

Good point. On [Forex.com](/brokers/forexcom "View FOREX.com Broker Profile") broker, it only reached 3 pips below the breaking candle close, before reversing.

Hey V!   
Thanks for sharing your system!I still learning it, and I use a different trading system. It is actually an online platform, so I cant use your MT4-s stuff, but try to built in many as I can.  
  
Am I correct that is a bearish signal on EUR/JPY?

Pairs showing on DynamiteHelper/ProfileGen, with my thoughts:  
  
AUDCAD: Something funny about the wave, not a clean LL-LH. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f615.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/2753.png?v=15.1)  
  
EURJPY: LH is broken above the H4 trend line (resistance); stochs are oversold on H1 as price is retracing back across trend line -- maybe will pull upward again, then we will see if it breaks down for signal?  
  
GBPCAD: H1 riding up the upper BB; if it doesn't turn around soon it will be making a HH, which is against rules for a sell (need LH).  
  
GBPUSD: H1 riding up the upper BB, plus testing 200 EMA and may be forming a HH, against rules for a sell (need LH). (Sure enough, I ran the script again and it was gone from the profile.)  
  
So movement of the GBP pairs is similar.... something must be hap w gbp

Seems really reluctant to cross... the MA level is also right on the major trendline EJ had broken yesterday/today.  
Additionally, this is 2nd candle on the lower BB, so it seems like a critical moment...

I thought to give you all a homework that why I took the ej but S, answered it already, well done S.  
  
I'll be waiting for a better explanation, with images. This system is a miracle you just need some creativity. This is a new lesson.

I want to make sure I am not confused abut the rules let me know what I can refine to practice and backtest / forward test to get a handle on your system here ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
#1 - Look for swinging market on the H4 charts --> Making LL, LH = Selling opportunities ; HH. HL = Buying opportunities  
#2 - When 4 hour color stoch = > 70 --> Looking for SELL ENTRY--> SWITCH TO 1 hour ONLY WHEN break of emas confirmed candle close 5 pips below EMAs  
When 4 hour color stoch = < 30 --> Looking for BUY ENTRY -->SWITCH TO 1 hour ONLY WHEN break of emas confirmed candle close 5 pips below EMAs  
Note - Rule is enter when price breaks ALL ema's on 1 hour timeframe - enter 5 pips below the close of the 1 hour candle  
#3 - Look for widening of / seperation of 5,3,3 stochastic for further confirmation   
#4 - Stop loss = recent swing high or low ; Take Profits = End of Heiken Ashi trend = Trade 0.01 per $100 on account for risk management  
#5 - AVOID NEWS?  
  
Questions:  
I recall reading something about being cautious about the break of 200 ema (you use ema yes ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)?) Just wanted to ask about what we should be cautious about?  
Do you use Dynamite Helper Script to find setups to look at? How many pairs you suggest we look at?  
Any better exit strategy than heiken ashi you recommend?  
How much time you spend on charts + any times you find are the best times to trade ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)? Thank you Vman!!!   
  
Attached is all of my screenshots what I still study after going through whole thread last night. I had barely any sleep I will study like a madman over this weekend and next few days I want to get on your level ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) Thanks again I feel this will be the key to my success I crave consistency!!!

I'm not V (by any stretch of the imagination) but I can answer some from what he's already written.  
  
He mentioned that the 200 EMA tends to act as S/R (posts [#70](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=8779916#post8779916), [#112](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=8781027#post8781027)), so crossing it is a big deal. AFAIU, it may mean the trend has weakened or is reversing.  
And yes, he said he uses a 200 _EMA_ , but the template is actually SMA by default, so you have to change it if you want to match his (post [#70](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=8779916#post8779916)).  
V's been trading loooooooong before I posted those scripts here, so I highly doubt he uses them. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1) But the criteria in the scripts is a basic, mandatory criteria in the rules, so I think it is safe --- to help narrow down what pairs to look at, without loading them _all_ one-by-one.  
There are several ways to do the Heiken Ashi exits... he first mentioned the 1 you described (post [#51](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=8779483#post8779483)). V's other way he tried to explain in posts [#145](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=8781324#post8781324), [#210](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=8781893#post8781893), but I think we're waiting on clarification.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
He said there are _no trading hours_... we take trades 24/5 (post [#82](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=8780112#post8780112)), and trade pretty much _every pair_ with an entry ([#85](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=8780380#post8780380)).  
_I thought_ he said it doesn't take long at all, to check all the charts around bar time. Mbe didn't. But I SUSPECT he only spends a few minutes per hour..  
  
edit: V is really busy--- he might not have time to unpack your rar and go through it all. The best chance of getting an opinion is to embed annotated screenshots here in real-time. I'm planning to start uberman so I can journal every hour (on my own) and post some here.

My late EJ entry went to profit for a bit, but now market has for 2nd time risen off top of major trend resistance and BB support. It could just be natural way downward / nothing to worry abt. But 3 out of 4 stochs are still ~oversold, and I don't like the feeling of this ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)  
  
This is where I get confused. Traders often lose because MMs/LPs love triggering stops to feed their order flow in same direction. So if I fold at 123.535 (prev LH), market could hit it & then drop. Waiting for HA color change should keep trade open longer.

That is a good point.  
A small retracement should be assessed on small TF.

Stochastic divergence could signal good setup for GJ short and continuation of long term trend. Wait and see...

Trade Interceptor is very good... has pretty much everything. Fibs are on the tools screen.

hey,  
which broker do you use Trade Interceptor with?  
  
(in the past I tried Dukascopy, but I find them -their LP'S and tick data- **very** unreliable)

I haven't switched to mobile yet, but soon will to save aging laptop. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f64f.png?v=15.1)  
  
In the Paradox thread, the system is *highly* sensitive to price feed, and Dove only used [Forex.com](/brokers/forexcom "View FOREX.com Broker Profile"), same as V recommends.  
Ofc this is not available on TI. But people in the thread said [FXCM](/brokers/fxcm "View FXCM Broker Profile") gave the same charts/signals, and Sicarious here [appears to be using](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=8788239#post8788239) FXCM with good results, as well. So I'd probably go with them.  
  
But to be honest I hadn't given it much thought yet. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61e.png?v=15.1)

Interesting correlations between different signals on different TFs, long not triggered yet on EJ (5 pips above candle break)

More reasons to have closed already:

  1. M15 forming a HL-HH.
  2. Heiken H1 changed to blue, as per post [#51](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=8779483#post8779483).
  3. V closed. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1) (sorry I know i know... )

This is the time people start switching strategy, stick to any strategy you have chosen for a month at least, you will get result. I'm back and free and have started trading on my live account, the way I used to.

One thing I love about V's system is the setups pop up like whack-a-mole.  
  
No twiddling thumbs the entire day, there is always 1-3 or more pairs on watch.  
  
Which means faster learning.

true that. Only weakness in oneself will really lead to failure with any good system. Happy to be in for the long haul ☺

Anyone who's using the scripts-- I need to retract what I said, i.e. I don't recommend them.  
If the market is consolidating about the 200 EMA, as with GBPNZD here on V's chart, the code will not trigger if it's 1) on the wrong side, and then 2) breaks down just as stoch is diving. Like it did here.  
  
Yes I could I update it to catch cases like this. But there are other edge cases too.  
I'm going to use my brain, and not code until I have success manually.  
  
Gbpnzd: seeing the range & consistency of the previous corrections of LTT, it looks like it could go North much farther. kind of makes me nervous to sell. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f615.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/2753.png?v=15.1)

(Checks at lower TF bar close, instead of every tick.) Customize lower TF, alert & email settings -- disabled by default. Reports "New" and "Unchanged" pairs separately. Is totally silent if nothing new. Rushed to get this out so testing was very basic. Will update if any issues. ((So sorry for deleted post.

Hi Sigill,  
  
Can you please help to include selected currency for this filtering? it actually cover a lot of currency which i not usually trade, if would be good to only keep it down to the common 28 currency pairs.  
  
It is a great tools to filter the potential pairs, thanks for your hard work, appreciate it =)

Yes that's a good idea.  
  
2.1 New features:

  1. Can input a [list of symbols](http://pastebin.com/13GTv3EM) to use.
  2. Set custom overbought/oversold levels, to catch borderline cases.
  3. Option to disable the separator ------------ ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)
  4. Option to check every tick if desired -- CPU intensive, but may catch more potential setups (see post [#457](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=8789837#post8789837)).

2.2:

  1. Added exact-match option for Calvin's broker. No need to update if it worked fine for you.

I don't know what platform you're using, but MT4 on Android has Fibs. Just tap the chart and click the shapes button...

Note that it works fine for [Forex.com](/brokers/forexcom "View FOREX.com Broker Profile") broker, which V. strongly recommends to use.  
But I've added an option for you... just set "useExactPairNames" to true. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

KMR4UALL create a lot of EA and I appreciate all his work.  
But in my opinion (sorry if I am wrong), a robot can't use in this kind of strategy.  
Same reason as Sigill explanation on this post : [here](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=8787597#post8787597)  
  
I think the DynamiteHelper indicator help a lot.  
I am not try it yet, I am still trying to train my eyes to look at the EMAs and Stoch.. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

After eyeballing all the pictures Varun posted along with the explanations and discussions I am beginning to see the light and consistency of this set-up.  
It is not complicated at all IMHO. Nonetheless the eyes will need to get trained to recognize the buy / sell opportunities.  
The pictures now look "strange" without Varun's "hand-sketched marks ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1).  
  
I will start posting pictures and trades where I use this strategy.  
Thanks Varun, Sigill and others for making this post so interesting and useful. 

Live life king size !

V mentioned Mr. Pip's harmonic trading thread is very good for making this system work (post [#211](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=8781924#post8781924)). I'm going to spend some time there to study, so won't post here for a little while. But I am in this for the long haul, like swamp donkey said

Hi,  
  
Anyone can understand below statement, what does it mean and any example can provided as illustration?  
  
" Try to avoid trades if the price breaks 200MA in 1hr chart and the other Ma's are above it as in case of sell and vice versa"  
  
For 1Hr chart, for sell entry, the price should break below all the MA. For above statement, are Varun mean that the even through price break all the MA, however, if the 34MA & 55MA are above the 200MA, then we should not enter the trade even through it break all the 3 MA? Is my understanding correct?  
  
Anyone can advise?

Blue = 34 SMA.  
Red = 55 SMA.  
Black = 200 SMA by default... varun recommends Ema instead.

Most trader use 200MA as support and resistance, so if price break a 200MA, maybe price trying to break support or resistance.  
If price break 200MA down but the faster MA still above 200MA this is not good take a sell yet..  
CMIIW..  
  
The picture explain what Varun mean :

Can anyone make these changes to the EA? I'm sure we can get this thing to be profitable with a bit of work. As for it not monitoring trend on higher time frame, why can't we set it up so it has to run on both the H1 and H4 and even Daily, and use Global Variables to each other when the price is right on all 3 to trade?

The guy wants to sit at home and do nothing. He wants it easy so I gave him my entire system that I wrote down in my diary and explained it to him how to do well with it and he still doesn't do it. His life went downhill as soon as he graduated college. But I plan to cut ties because I can't be responsible for an adult if he still won't do anything about his life.

Yes mate, but its not about the strategy only but about the music too, I've been trading only this for past few years, ofcourse with few many improvisation but concept remains the same. Last July we took an account to $7 mill from 0.8 but a small mistake brought it down to 3.8 mill last whole year was about money management let's see how it goes from here.

I hope you'll make a detailed post about it! Just found you and this method opened my eyes for sure. Still can't figure out how you average 34hours in trade but trade 4hr chart.. One of the reasons I prefer to trade 15 min TF cause it seems trading in 4hr takes too damn long.. Or am I missing out on something?  
  
All the best!

Also, Varun,  
  
I thought of a concept of what I'd like to know, maybe this will help to break everything down easier when you make a new post. Also, let me know if you need any help with tutorial pictures or anything. I'll be glad to learn and help you out at the same time. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
1\. Name of your Strategy (just kidding)  
2\. Indicators used  
3\. Indicators settings  
4\. Timeframes used  
5\. First thing to look for, second, third and etc.  
6\. How to place your entry  
7\. How to place your stop loss  
8\. How to correctly exit the trade  
9\. What currencies to trade this strategy with  
10\. How many trades there are per one week / one month  
11\. Average profit per one week / one month in pips  
12\. Average risk / reward ratio  
13\. Average time in-trade  
14\. Is it still possible to enter the trade if the “on-point” entry happened during sleep time?  
15\. Is it possible to use a different time frame with the strategy and what would be the benefits and vice versa?  
16\. Do you still use MT4 instead of MT5 and why?  
  
Best regards!

Hi Varun,  
  
Hope you're well and still considering updating your strategy. I'd love to hear about all the updates you have in mind!  
  
I'm going through your previous posts and trying to mash it up with my own knowledge of things to build a simple and understandable chart. So far this is how it looks. I'd say EUR/USD is indicating strongly that it wants to go down. What would you say? I know that on 1hr MA crossed upside, but everything else indicates otherwise. So is it too early for it yet anyways?   
  
I checked through a lot of currencies and it looked like only EUR could be shorted for this week and nothing else. EUR/USD is the strongest one though.  
  
But I feel like that there is a possibility that this week could really end up without any suitable trades at all, right? Or is it still possible to find a good trade for this week let's say using your MA and Stochastic strategy as base? I'm afraid I'm too strict for the strategy at this point and missing out on good opportunities.   
  
Looking forward to hearing from you!

It's the same method I used on the 5-minute frame. How are microwaves filtered?

A good indicator that allows you to filter entries on small timeframes (recommended for use during the European trading session)
