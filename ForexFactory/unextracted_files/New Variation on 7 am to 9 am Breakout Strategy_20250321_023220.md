Alright. It was suggested that I start this thread because the original dynamics of my system changed basically the entire trading system that I was originally posting on which was the 7 am to 9 am big dog breakout strategy. A good amount of the information that I will put in this thread will be taken from posts I made in that thread (which by the way is a pretty good strategy, just not quite for me). This is a more conservative trading strategy than a lot of the other strategies on here and has a pretty nice risk to reward ratio, which is 3:5 risk/reward. What I've learned from my trading is to keep risk low, reward high, and stick to your rules once you have them set. And with that, I'm going to post the rules for my system. If you have any questions, make sure to ask them and I will answer them best I can.  
  
I always trade EUR/USD. Feel free to test it with other USD pairs, but I have not tested them. If you do test them, please post your results here for everyone else to see.  
  
So, here is what you need:  
2 vertical lines  
\- One at 7:00 a.m. ET  
\- One at 9:00 a.m. ET  
  
2 horizontal lines  
\- One at the highest point between 7 and 9  
\- One at the lowest point between 7 and 9  
  
Fibonacci  
\- 0.000 at the high point between 7 and 9 and 1.000 at the low  
\- 1.000 at the high point between 7 and 9 and 0.000 at the low  
\- The fibs that you should have set up for each of these are 0.000, 1.000, 1.272, 1.500, 1.764, and 2.000  
  
Now, the fibs will show you where to enter and exit your trades. You'll want to set Entry Orders at 1.272. You'll want to divide your trades up into thirds. The stop for each trade is going to be the 1.000 fib line. You'll have three limits set up, one for each third of your trade. Take profit on one third at 1.500, take profit again on another third at 1.764, and take profit on the rest of the trade at 2.000. For the SL, move them up to break even as soon as the first TP is hit, then move them to the first TP line when the second TP is hit to make sure that you lock in some profit.  
  
Now you'll se up these trades in both directions right at 9 a.m. ET. If the long trades are hit, cancel the short orders. In the same way, cancel the long trades when the short orders are hit.  
  
Last thing I would like to say is that this strategy does not bank an extremely high number of pips. This is for people that want to trade conservatively and use higher lot sizes to lock in their profits eary.  
  
I hope this makes sense. This is the first time I've just tried to explain it all in one post, so if you have any questions at all, let me know. I'm attaching a picture of the first "live" trade that I made, which was last Wednesday (5/20). Since that day, I've had 4 wins, 1 break even, and 1 loss. (Didn't trade memorial day). I know that there are some others on here who have started to trade this method, and I would appreciate it if some of you could post some of your personal results using this. Anyways, think I'm done...

Been following this method recently.  
  
Reg. lots, I do it slightly differently.  
  
If I trade 10 minis, I use 5 for TP1, 3 for TP2 and 2 for TP3.  
  
Lucas,   
You have already answered these questions in the other thread, but for clarity, if you don't mind, please post them here as well.  
  
1)What time do you remove pending orders if they are not triggered?  
2)What major announcements would make you not place pending orders at 9 ET? Like FOMC, NFP etc.

Good call. I like the idea. I might start doing that. Would've made a higher profit on Tuesday if I would've done it that way.

1\. If neither the long nor short has been hit by 4 or 5 pm ET, I cancel the pending orders. I let them slide for a while because when I did my backtest, there were a couple that would trigger at 2 to 3 pm.  
2\. So far I have not found any specific announcements that would keep me from placing a pending order because there are days that the announcements seem to help. If it is ranging during those hours one of the announcements usually causes it to break out in one direction or another.  
  
Hope that answered them for you.

This is my trade from 5/21. The first picture shows the pending orders as set up in [FXCM](/brokers/fxcm "View FXCM Broker Profile") which is who I trade through. The second picture shows after the long order was triggered and the stops were hit. I cancelled the short orders as soon as my long orders were triggered.

If you add these levels to your fibs along with the ones you have in the first post, you won't have to pull two fibs. It will show the same levels no matter which way you pull them.

Unfortunately on Marketscope, which comes with FXCM, there isn't an option to add negative fibs... If there is I'm missing it, but it doesn't accept the - sign.

Hey mer071898,  
  
As the old joke goes, I could have used that info, yesterday! I spent a coupla hours figuring that out on my own earlier this morning. LOL  
  
Seriously, that is a very nice enhancement to the fib tool.  
  
Good trading!

Awesome. Glad it worked out for you. Last week Friday didn't work too well for me so I'm trying it again tomorrow before I start doubting whether or not it will work.

I have a question, when you initially buy/sell where do you put your initial stop loss? At the high/low of the 7am-9am breakout that got broken? Also, I have been backtesting a little on the GBP/JPY and it seems to also do very well(what can I say, I like risk).

If you look at the image, it's at the high from the 7 am to 9 am box for the long trades, or the low for the short trades. I looked at the GBP/JPY and just decided to leave it alone. Good luck though and let me know how it works out if you start trading it live.

Looks like GBP/JPY Sell trade was filled on IBFX @154.03, but only moved 12 pips positive before retracing and hitting the SL, today.  
  
My recommendation would be to stick with EUR/USD with Lucas. He already has a positive track record. That's what I'm doing until we can determine other pairs that show promise.  
  
Good trading!

OK, I see it now. This does have a really nice rick:reward component. I will track GBP/JPY for a week or two and if it is still successful I will trade both the EUR/USD and GBP/JPY live. I will let you know the results.

I think you are right I also use fxcm, don't think the platform allows negative fibs. By the way good strat wonder how well it would work on GU

This is my second Friday live. When I backtested, I didn't keep track of the specific days, just the totals of wins/losses/breakevens. I was trying not to curve-fit it. I have been trading live for a little less than two weeks with this system.

Not sure about the GU. Not nearly enough time for me to backtest it or even trade with my demo account. If you get the time to, let me know how it works.

Fair enough, its well thought out, if you dont mind.....how far back did the backtest go and on what time frame were you testing it on?

Thanks for posting this interesting variation of a box breakout system.  
  
Couple of questions.........  
do you add spread to your long entries?  
do you add spread to the stop loss for short trades?

Great method, nice and simple, thanks for sharing!  
  
Just to make sure I have all the rules correct, I visually marked and backtested eurusd from 5/4 til present.  
From what I can see, the following days were losers?  
5/12   
(looks like it came within a pip of opening the short at fib, if it opened it was a loss)  
  
5/19 - loss  
5/22 - loss  
  
Is this correct? If one of these is not a losing day, please let me know so I can see where I am miscalulating.  
  
Thanks again for sharing, I really like this simple breakout method.

If you look at the box range on those days, especially 5/19 & 5/22, they were well over 70+pips. What's happening is your exhausting the range and not allowing room to trade. If it were me I would limit the box range to 1/4 to 1/3 of the average daily range to limit the risk. And do not trade if the box range is over 45-50 pips maximum. Obviously, this is just an opinion and not to be construed any differently.

Hi,  
  
I found a nice XL sheet from another thread, which can be used to calculate the # of lots that can be traded. Once we enter the ac balance, risk %, entry, SL, TP1 and TP2, the sheet calculates the recommended lots to trade, and displays the risk/reward data. Pretty neat.  
  
However, as of now, it shows only two TPs. I'm not an XL nerd - if anyone :nerd:can take this and modify it so that we can enter the TP3 data, it would be great ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
Thanks.

Good suggestion on the box limit. This was also suggested in the original strategy thread - the profitability decreases as the box size increases. Will keep an eye on that as well.

I have a Broco 4,0 demo account and would like to try this system. However, neither the fib expansion nor retracement tools are like the ones used by others in this discussion. Is it possible to modify them? Or download a fib tool? Or should I get another demo trading platform? Thanks.

I'm in on this one, system filtered out a false break south (by about one or two pips!), looks like its ready to break upwards.

range for the box was like about 50pips. Maybe it was friday also. Might not be a good day to trade this.

I was testing the same trade on my demo. You're right, Friday might not be a good day. Will keep testing.

As others have posted, today's trade was a loss.   
  
However, its just two fridays and not sure if we can conclude based on these two days. We need to look into more samples and then decide.  
  
If 60% of Fri trades (may be out of like 10-15 fri trades) are in the red, then I'd be wary of that stats.  
  
Thanks.

-13.6 pips today on the long. So, I also got stopped out. I see a lot of questions in here, and unfortunately I have to get to school in the next hour. This afternoon though, I will post one reply to answer all of your questions. To answer one quickly, this weekend, I'm going to try to go back and backtest only Fridays to see if it seems to be a trend due to the ranging market. I'll post what I find along with answering a lot of questions when I get back.  
  
So totals since I started trading live last Wednesday is   
5 wins  
2 losses  
1 break even  
  
With a 3:5 risk/reward those are pretty decent numbers. Now to find how to raise the win % (if possible).

Gentlemen the problem is not friday but the preceding price action. Any time break outs occur in london session with accompanying strong volatility, you rarely going to get good set ups because the currencies often than not have run thier daily ranges

Hi Bill!  
  
Good to see you on this thread...your expertise and opinion are valuable resources for us, here!  
  
I made my EUR/USD trades today on [Oanda](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile"). My Long trade hit the SL. I don't add broker spread (only .9 pip) into box calculations, because I believe that distorts the box parameters. I don't use any box offset amount, either for the same reason. My box extends from 6:00 AM until 8:05 AM CDT.  
  
_My entries:_  
High Price: 1.4135  
Low Price: 1.4085  
Price Range: 50 pips  
Max Risk: 42 pips  
Max Reward: 72 pips  
  
**BUY** entry: 1.4149  
SL: 1.4135  
TP1: 1.4160  
TP2: 1.4173  
TP3: 1.4185  
**SELL** entry: 1.4071  
SL: 140.85  
TP1: 1.4060  
TP2: 1.44047  
TP3: 1.4035  
  
I am wondering what broker you used to avoid the pullback? In addition, I also use IBFX, and all the trading parameters were within 3 pips compared to Oanda.

Same happened to me on GBPJPY today, painfull. that reminds me of an adagium i read all over the forums;"never trade on Friday" . Well....  
Now i have the weekend to digest this. Best regards, Ludo

I saw the same false breakout. Not at home right now, but based on the original 7 am to 9 am breakout strategy, it would have hit. It would have triggered the short right at the low of the box, then reversed to lose 50 pips (based on the original method). I will try to post a picture of the chart when I do get home. If someone else has their chart from today, can you post that? Basically, the reason I enter at the 1.272 fib instead of the 1.000 is in case it goes a couple of pips in that direction then reverses. Had I entered at 1.000 on my short it would have been triggered, then reversed. Didn't help that the same thing happened on my long, but oh well. That's trading.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

I was mistaken.  
I was the one looking at the wrong bars.  
When I looked at it correctly, there was a false breakout.

Hey, those fib extensions aren't the real text book fibs. Wouldn't they be 1.236, 1.382, 1.500, 1.618, and 2.000? 

You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.

My results since last Wednesday (When I went live with this). I will reply to everybody's questions as soon as I have some free time.  
  
Wednesday 5/20 - (+25.6) WIN  
Thursday 5/21 - (+27.0) WIN  
Friday 5/22 - (-16.7) LOSS  
Tuesday 5/26 - (+31) WIN  
Wednesday 5/27 - (+5) BREAKEVEN  
Thursday 5/28 - (+21.8) WIN  
Friday 5/29 - (-13.6) LOSS  
  
Total = (+80.1)  
  
Notice that my totals are averages of the three trades that day instead of individual trades. If I were to list the totals of each individual "trade" with all of the TPs added together instead of averaged, it would be 240.3 pips. So, it all depends on how you look at it. So, 80 pips up so far. Time to keep going.

Not sure about the 1.236, but yes to the 1.382 and 1.618. My broker has those in it also, but I just used these to give me a good risk:reward ratio.  
  
Morton, yes. Stop was in the correct place. That was my 13 pip loss.  
  
As far as the price action of the previous session affecting this trading method, I'm more than open for ideas if someone wants to backtest and see if that's the common denominator of the losing trades. We're all in it to make money, right? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
I think I answered all of the questions in here. If I didn't, please let me know and I'll get right on it.

It was suggested that I start this thread because the original dynamics of my system changed basically the entire trading system that I was originally posting on which was the 7 am to 9 am big dog breakout strategy. A good amount of the information that I will put in this thread will be taken from posts I made in that thread (which by the way is a pretty good strategy, just not quite for me). This is a more conservative trading strategy than a lot of the other strategies on here and has a pretty nice risk to reward ratio, which is 3:5 risk/reward....

Lucas,  
I show different results for 5/21. I see that hitting tp1 then retracing and getting you out at breakeven for the remainder of the lots.  
Where do we differ?  
  
[quote=lucashammer;2767090]My results since last Wednesday (When I went live with this). I will reply to everybody's questions as soon as I have some free time.  
  
Thursday 5/21 - (+27.0) WIN - long 1.3810, hit tp1 at 3828, retraced back so only +15 pips on half the trade, BE on rest

While testing this method, I decided to try having the third stop loss at around the middle of the range, rather than starting it at the 1 fib level and moving it to break even after the other take profits were hit. This will have bigger drawdowns when the price changes direction, but it also allows for the 2 fib level to be hit when price retraces slightly.  
  
I tested this between May 11th to May 22nd, and unless I missed something (which is quite possible, my brain is fried) it seemed to allow for a higher positive pip count overall.  
  
Does anyone else have any comments on this?  
  
I'm planning on testing this more long term, but was wondering if anyone else has tested this and found it wasn't effective.

Correct, after initiating the sell order it retracted. Only lost 11.8 pips though so not too bad.

If you placed all 3 trades as per the setup rules, that's 35.4 pips cumulative loss. If you had divided your normal lot trade size by 3, then 11.8 isn't too bad.  
  
I applied the system to GJ this morning, and both TP1 and TP2 have been hit. I'm in profit +36 pips from TP1 and another +79 pips on TP2 for a total of +105 pips so far. Waiting on results from 3rd order, but by moving my TP3 SL to the TP1 level, I am guaranteed another 36 pips.  
  
So...worse case scenario is +141 pips on GJ, today.  
  
Thanks, Lucas!

BTW, [Oanda](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile") spiked their spread to 10 pips for several minutes about 1/2 hour ago. I didn't affect my trade, but it surely could have. The market wasn't moving significantly, either. This is a major cause of concern.  
  
Oanda now incorporates a trailing stop for the first time. The option appears on the order entry screen.  
  
Good trading!

TP3 hit @ 158.13 on Oanda  
  
+221 pips total for all 3 trades in profit. The market only had to move 117 pips from entry to achieve the 3 wins...not especially a big move for the GJ pair.

Out for 11.8 pips today. Once again, the box was over 50 pips high to low, so that might be a variable I hadn't paid enough attention to before on my losses. Still in the green (which is easy to do with a 3:5 risk:reward) but trying to improve. Has anyone done any major backtesting for any of the other pairs?

Today didn't have to be a total loss. If you had actually placed the stop limits again it would have been triggered and it hit TP2 allowing you to make back your pips and a little profit. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
  
I know it's against the rules but I did it because PA didn't make a higher high so it had a chance of continuing short.

Every morning I look at what happened while I slept, and every morning I'm amazed at the price action I missed out on. The London open is definitely a period of good volatility. Unfortunately I'm one of those Yanks on eastern US time. 

You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.

Hi All:  
Even though this is a purely mechanical system, using the 50 pip box size filter seems to help.   
In today's case (6/2), E/$ has already move a lot since London open. It could move - I don't know. Since the box size is larger than 50, its a no trade for me today.  
  
Thanks

mer071898, I'd be interested in what you've found. I've been hoping someone would check other sessions with other strategies.

Hey all, I've posted my thread called the [London Progressive Strategy](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=2773985&posted=1#post2773985) for you.

Hi everyone. I am on vacation to Chicago right now, so I've been unable to make any trades this week. I know that Monday and Tuesday both resulted in small losses. Was anyone able to make the trade today or could anyone at least post the charts with the fibs on it? My access to charts is hit and miss. Thanks. And when I get back, I'll be able to check the losses to hopefully find a common denominator to improve this even further.

Lucas,  
Here you go.  
  
Again no trade for me today after applying the 50 pip box size filter.

Here is my chart from today. I didn't actually take this trade, but it looks like it also would have resulted in a loss. The box was over 50 pips, and so I stayed out. Plus price was near the Murrey reversal lines.

I wrote a script to backtest the USD pairs for the past 6 months. I used [FXPro](/brokers/fxpro "View FxPro Broker Profile") for this test and they are on CET. To the best of my knowledge, the EU recognized Daylight Savings on 3/29/09. The US recognized Daylight Savings on 3/8/09. Normally FxPro is 7 hours ahead of Eastern Time. That puts the box at 14:00 - 15:55 (I used 5 minute chandles for this test). During the gap between 3/8 and 3/29, FxPro was only 6 hours ahead of Eastern Time. That puts the box during there dates at 13:00 - 14:55.  
  
I used 5 minute candles to provide more accurate results. However, these results may differ from actual results because a lot can happen in 1 5-minute candle. For example, there are some 5 minute candles that flew throught 1.272, 1.500, 1.764, and 2.000 fibs. From the 5 minute candle there is no way to determine if there were any retraces that would cause a SL to be hit.  
  
The attached results file is Excel 2007 and uses some Excel 2007 specific formulas. Those with previous Excel version may not see all calculations. I went ahead and included both a 2007 version (2007.xls) and a 2003 version (BigDogFibTestUSD-NY.xls). Since I have Excel 2007, I have no idea how the .xls version will perform. If you want to use the 2007 version, rename file to 2007.xlsx. In the Excel file, note that "PF" stands for Profit Factor.  
  
I have not had time to verify each and every trade manually. I chose random trades and manually verified the best I could.  
  
Hopefully this will assist many of you in determining the best application of this strategy.

zznbrm,  
  
Thanks for the backtest. Quick question. Did this filter out all of the trades where the box was over 50 pips?  
  
EDIT: Nevermind, I see it now. By the way, profit was noticeably higher limited the box to less than 50 pips.  
  
EDIT: Final edit, 45 pips seems to be the magic number on this backtest. Pips showing around 1000 if the box size is limited to Less Than 45. zznbrm, Thanks again. This is invaluable in updating my system.

None of my data includes the spread. The problem with < 50 pip box size is that the spread will really eat into profits for those pairs with higher [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide"). Not a huge problem for EURUSD and USDJPY, depending on your broker.

We would've knocked out 128 pips during the London session last night. I've still got to knock out a few kinks and research a different filter but it's getting pretty close.

I've just made a few changes in the [London Progressive Strategy](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=2773804#post2773804) thread for testing. I am no longer going to use the Murrey indicator as I feel that the timeframe is too small for reliable use. I will be using the Trend Magic indicator to help with filtering out the direction. I've also added a separate entry level on the fib tool at -.236 and 1.236. The old entry levels of -.382 and 1.382 will be used as a stop for TP 2. When price hits TP 2, you will now move your stop to this point. These changes will allow for an earlier entry but not sacrifice those pips back when we do get stopped out. All changes I've made are now on the 1st post along with a new zip file with the indicators and template.

Yeah, I have a usual 1 or 2 pip spread on my EUR/USD so I don't think that it would be a problem. Plus my TPs always include the spread so I make the full profit. Anyways, thanks again. I think I'm going to use this in conjunction with another trading strategy for the +45 pip box days.

They're not really the Fibonacci ratios except for the 50% level. The OP came up with them empirically.

Gustav, you need the Fib EXTENSION tool, rather than the default retracement tool. The extension tool is not on the toolbar by default. Place it on the chart. Highlight, rightclick it, then alter the levels in the menu. You can then drag the three points to the edge of the box.

I've attached an Excel spreadsheet I've been using every morning. I believe it captures the rules that have been laid out in this thread.  
  
This spreadsheet takes the high and low you enter and tells you what the entry and TP levels are. In addition, you can enter a max box size as a filter. In the thread, we've discussed the observation that if the high-low distance (i.e. "the box") is less that 45-50 pips, then the odds of the trade working out are better. You can enter any max box size you wish, but I've filled it in as 45 pips by default. There's a field that basically says Yes or No to say whether or not to take the trade based on this filter.  
  
I'm on [Oanda](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile") so we don't use lots or micro-lots but units. So my spreadsheet will also tell you how many units to trade based on you max risk amount and the initial entry and stop prices.  
  
I protected the sheet with no password, so you can unprotect the sheet easily. I only did this to prevent me from screwing up the formula cells.  
  
I've found it useful; hopefully at least one other person will too. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60e.png?v=15.1)

I would agree that based on my original post it turns out fairly close to a breakeven. However, there was a backtest done and if the box size is limited to 45 pips, the gains are substantially higher than the losses trading the EUR/USD. The problem appears to be exhaustion if the box is too big. There are backtesting results posted in this thread where you can find the max box size and view the results that way.

I do not have a template for this as I don't trade using MetaTrader. stevegee58 posted a spreadsheet to give you the numbers if you only know the high/low. I'm sure someone on here can post a template for it that does use MetaTrader.

lucashammer,  
  
I just started using Marketscope 2.0 and am new to Forex. I SIM traded your 7-9am strategy the past 2 days and have had all gains and no losses.   
  
My question to you is you recommend placing 3 limits with the pending order and scale out of the trade.

For the SL, move them up to break even as soon as the first TP is hit, then move them to the first TP line when the second TP is hit to make sure that you lock in some profit

.  
I placed my pending entry order but how do I add the other 2 limits without opening 2 more pending entry orders?

Eminiforex,  
  
Glad to hear you've had success with my strategy. I actually place three pending orders in each direction, each for a third of what I would normally trade. There is not a way that I know of to place a single order with three limits. I know it gets a little tedious but it is worth it in my opinion.

Which pairs have you traded this with?  
  
According to the 45 pip filter rule, there wouldn't have been any trades this week.

On 6-10-09 I traded the EUR/USD. I just did one pending order and one profit target. I hit the 1st profit target and made 19 pips and the price went a total of 107 pips.  
  
The second trade was on 6-11-09 with the EUR/USD and I got 16 pips and it trended for 162 total pips. I will start putting 3 pending orders next time to get more pips.  
  
I have attached screen shots of both days below:

Earlier we determined that having the box smaller than 50 pips improved your odds in this setup. That said, I followed the rules but watched as price action moved so that it would have been profitable anyway. LOL

Lucas, how did you manipulate the box size using BigDogFibTestUSD-NY file?

I don't use the file since I don't use MetaTrader to make my trades. The backtest results were posted by someone else a little while back and using excel, I tested the results with different box sizes.

I don't use the fibonacci retracements the way that most people do. I simply used them just to have mechanical entry and exit points to remove any emotion from it. I'm sure someone can post the uses on here somewhere.

Hi Jim,  
  
It's actually been about a month since my first post. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) However, keeping the box under 45 through backtests showed a much higher probability for success.

Hello all,  
I am new to the thread. This looks good.   
Somebody see if I understand. From 7-9am EST today the low was 3822, the high was 3896. That is a range of 74 pips. So from wht I understand, the best advice is not to trade? Wait for a day with a range of 50 or less?  
But if I did trade long I would go long @ 1.3916?  
Thanks  
Michael

Nice system.  
  
Can I add my 2 cents?  
  
I don't think it has anything to do with the friday's that caused some of your not-so-good-days...  
  
May I suggest to try this on UK Open 3am EST. Set it at 1am and 3am or even 2am. You'll see a lot more results, for most currency pairs... What I have noticed during the UK open, if the pair is going in one direction by at least 40-50 pips, it'll continue to go in that direction, unless a news release comes out to make it go the other way before retracing again.  
  
Then set it up again for US open.

Nice little strategy, found that all 3 TP's got hit for Long Positions while I was asleep. Wish I had done a higher pip value now, only tested it out at $1.00 a pip.

That's exactly correct. Would have been a long at 1.3916, TPs at 1.39334, 1.39530, and 1.39706 which would have all hit today, but I didn't take it because of the box size.

Bob, thanks for the input. I would be willing to check out the UK open (pretty late for me, but I'm usually up anyways. I have not backtested it and I don't have the time to right now because of my job, but if I saw backtest results I would definitely consider jumping in that.

Old farts like me are usually sawing wood by the time London opens at 3 freakin' AM in the morning. You must be a college kid to be up that late LOL.

Just a check again to make sure I understand. Todays high and low was 1.3951 to 1.4001. So that is 50 pips, an acceptable box size. We entered short @ 1.3937 and hit all three targets. If we count the pips we made 11, 24, and 36. Do you divide by three to report the pip count?   
That would be 23.6 total. Im seeing that T1 is pretty close to the entry. Do you get stopped at BE a lot?

EST and GMT differ this time of the year 4 hrs.  
GMT NEVER changes through the year.

I don't actually. It seems to go on a pretty nice run once it does break out of the box. Today, for example, hit two TPs, then would have been stopped at the first for the final one. Seems to have a pretty good amound of momentum coming out of that box.

Technically, I think EST is always -5. However, right now we are in EDT (Eastern Daylight Time) which is -4.

Lucas,  
  
At first blush, it appears as if this strategy is working much better on GBP/USD as of late. Please have a look and give me your analysis.

Hey Bob,  
  
Thanks for the trading recommendation...I'll be using this tonight. Which currency pairs do you trade for the 1AM - 3AM EST session? And by the way, do you mean EDT rather than EST?  
  
Good trading,  
Bob

I have heard of people using the 1am to 3am session I just personally cant do it due to where I live it be way to inconvenient. But I have heard that the results are good but if you live in the U.S. the 9am seems like a better deal. the EURUSD and GBPUSD both seem to be the best to me in this type of breakout strategy.

Well the EU and the GU both worked well on both times last night and this morning, hit all 3 targets.  
I do not use such a tight stop, I watch mkt direction, or go halfway between the high and low of the box.

The past 3 out of 4 days I had a winning trades using the EUR/USD and the past 2 days I have had 2 winning trades with the GBP/USD trading the 7-9am EST.   
  
If I would have used a wider stop I would have had a winning trade on the EUR/USD today. I may back test this to see how loose of a stop is needed to have a higher percentage of winning trades

My 2 cents worth:  
  
Guppy and Cable are both performing extremely well if the following caveat is utilized. Be sure to set SL at either 50% or 61.8% retracement... absolutely necessary for sufficient breathing room for trades to move back and forth without hitting the SL. Result = greater profits.

Fibonacci  
\- 0.000 at the high point between 7 and 9 and 1.000 at the low  
\- 1.000 at the high point between 7 and 9 and 0.000 at the low  
\- The fibs that you should have set up for each of these are 0.000, 1.000, 1.272, 1.500, 1.764, and 2.000  
  
Could anyone tell me what is the basis of the above Fibo levels?  
How and why these levels are chosen?  
Just curious though.

Came with my trading platform and I wanted a good risk:reward ratio. Also wanted to make the entry and exit completely mechanical.

A fellow member directed me to this thread some time ago asking if I can make an EA for this system. I was real busy these past months so I've been away from FF for a while.. Now I'm free for the time being to respond to overdued requests... but the question is, do you guys actually want an EA for this system?? If not, I won't bother.

Great if you can program an EA for this system. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

I guess many of us coded the EA at least a draft for testing purpose. I can repeat again - in my opinion it's not profitable in long term i.e. 1 year

Has anyone experience 5 consecutive days of successful breakouts, or 5 days in a row of failed breakouts?

In my opinion, the key to profitability with this system, and any others, is Money Management.  
In this system, I believe that you are stopped out at the full amount of the Stop Loss level, with the full amount of your positions e.g. enter long at 1.5000 with 4 lots (for example), Stop Loss set to 1.4950 (for argument's sake) with all 4 lots closing for a loss at this price. Loss of 200 pips.  
  
Here's the thing-when in profit, you scale out in order to protect profits. Why not do the same when running at a loss in order to conserve capital? Scale out of the position to conserve your capital, rather than only scaling out of the position just to protect profits. It's the same side of the coin.  
  
If you do the Maths over the long term you'll see this makes sense. In the example above, if you closed out half your position at a 25 point loss, you've saved yourself 50 points (loss of 150 pips other than 200), while also remaining half in the position to make back your losses/make a profit.   
  
Take 5 losses at the full stop level of 50 pips (for argument's sake)-that's 1000 points. With the scaling out, you've reduced that to 750 points. In other words, a quarter of your account has been saved (assuming a full reversal occurred each time). And you're still in with half the position in case the price reverses.   
This is the arguing point however-if you stayed in with a full position then you would have made more money if the price went back in your direction etc etc. Well, if you approach trading as a business and therefore are conservative with risk, you'd know that the risk of this approach is not a good idea. Price is telling you where it wants to go. Thanks to the effectiveness of this system, it will usually have you on the right side of things, but on the times that it doesn't, don't be a slave to it and take the full hit every time.  
  
Conservation of capital, like with all trading systems, is the number 1 goal.  
The basic premise is this: if you reduce your losses on the bad days, then you'll increase your overall bank when you have your good days. Hope that makes sense+hope I haven't hijacked this thread, it's a good system that makes a lot of sense (and a lot of pips!)

Hi people ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1),  
  
I've been learning many strategies and systems online in many forums and sites including FF. I've learnt complicated ones which in the end doesn't work with many indicators filling the platform making your eyes blur. I've also learnt really simple ones but those simple ones are well, too simple and have some flaws. Till now, the best simple method I have learnt is the previous strategy from the previous thread which is Big Dog Breakout. It works very well form Eur/USD and GBP/USD but not good for USD/JPY because it always has reversals once it hits support or resistance. Then, I follow up to this thread and saw a much more complicated strategy again. I called it complicated because I consider myself as a newbie (Probabaly because I haven't go live) and I really have never used Fibs because my platform doesn't have one! I am really keen to add this system into my mastery book, lol. Please guide me people as I am really confuse with some basic stuff. Please don't take me as a fool for asking these questions as I am from Malaysia.  
  
My questions:  
1\. I don't know what is EST or EDT! And how do I convert it into my time which is at GMT+8 ,I really have serious time confusion.  
  
2\. How do i know my broker shift? And what is that btw =.="   
  
3\. Will the wrong broker shift i input affect my trading?  
  
4.Which platform is recommended? I am using Alpari now.  
  
5\. Whats the meaning of trailing stop (I don't have this in my platform)?  
  
6\. How do I see spread?   
  
7\. What is buy/sell limit?   
  
I know my questions are really simple and I hope I can get answers from experts here =) Please please teach me on how to convert time, understand the GMT, EST, EDT thingy.. GRR... Oh and btw, is it possible to download a Fib indicator? I do not know all these basics but I do know quite a few strategies and systems. So, I am still not a complete newbie xD  
  
Thanks a lot! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Answers below in **bold**. If inaccurate feel free to correct. Hope this helps you.  
  
Cheers,  
Chngster  
  
  
My questions:  
1\. I don't know what is EST or EDT! And how do I convert it into my time which is at GMT+8 ,I really have serious time confusion. **If you're using the NY Big Dog 7am-9am strategy, the only thing to bear in mind is that the Box needs to be drawn between the 7am to 9am candles on the 15M chart in NEW YORK TIME RELATIVE TO YOUR BROKER TIME.**  
  
**To find out your time relative to NY time, all you need to do is go to[www.FXStreet.com](http://www.FXStreet.com) to compare - look at the very top of the page, you can't miss it.**  
  
**E.g., if FXstreet.com say the current time in NY is 8.30am, and your broker time is 2030hrs, you now know that you should draw the Box from 1900hrs to 2100hrs on your platform. Too easy.**  
  
2\. How do i know my broker shift? And what is that btw =.=" **The time on your trading platform may be set by your broker, which may be different to GMT time. Broker shift is the difference between GMT time and the time set by your broker.**  
  
3\. Will the wrong broker shift i input affect my trading? **If you're using the 7am-9am NY strategy, you just need to draw the Box on the 15M candles that correspond to 7am and 9am New York time. I suspect 9am NY is 9pm in Malaysia, give or take an hour for daylight saving.**  
  
4.Which platform is recommended? I am using Alpari now. **Most people use MT4, but up to personal preference.**  
  
5\. Whats the meaning of trailing stop (I don't have this in my platform)? **Google this, the answer will become obvious.**  
  
6\. How do I see spread? **Depends on your platform. In MT4, you can right-click and select "properties" on your chart window, and tick the appropriate box which says something like "show ask (or bid) price"**  
  
7\. What is buy/sell limit? **The opposite of buy/sell stops. Google this, and see MT4 "help/trading/order types".**  
  
I know my questions are really simple and I hope I can get answers from experts here =) Please please teach me on how to convert time, understand the GMT, EST, EDT thingy.. GRR... Oh and btw, is it possible to download a Fib indicator? I do not know all these basics but I do know quite a few strategies and systems. So, I am still not a complete newbie xD

checking this out, is it a safe assumption to just buy or sell approx 15-16 pips past the high or low just for keeping it simple? and also to just take profit about 50-60 pips from there?

It's available in any MT4 platform.  
If you sue the help facility on MT4 that will also answer questions about trailing stops etc

If I am not mistaken, lucashammer suggested to move SL to BE once hit TP1.

Just change the default fibo level to the following you will have both end of the box with the fibo level accordingly (right click on fibo, select "fibo properties" and goto "fibo level"):  
  
0, 1, 1.272, 1.5, 1.764, 2, -0.272, -0.5, -0.764 & -1

THank you Chngster for answering my questions. I really appreciate it. I have one doubt though, why is it that in this thread, the box that should be drawn is 7am to 9am.. But I see form another thread which talks also on Big Dog Breakout, the technique is to draw 3 or 4 hours prior to the GBP Opening? My way of doing is 4am to 7am and I realize its very accurate, Cause most breakouts happen around 7.45 - 8.30 and they are very predicatable and obvious? Also, If I were to draw the box from 7am to 9am, I would have missed a lot of opportunities as I would have miss the breakouts? Isn't that so? Please correct me if I'm wrong. Thank you.

Thank you Maxximuz.  
But sorry, I am really finding it difficult to change this levels and to plot them. I will appreciate any detailed help your may provide to me.

I think it's a good point you've made regarding the 4am-7am Box NY Time (**Middle Box**). The range for the Middle Box is often tighter than the NY box.   
  
Although this can be interpreted as a way of getting into breakouts earlier, I am afraid to do that because often the NY Box will trend one way until 9am NY time, perform a switchback between 9Am to 10am NY time, and then switchback again from 10am NY time to....whenever (this last direction change is probably going to be the main one of the day).  
  
In other words, if we use the tramlines of the Middle Box (assuming entry at 7am NY time) I think we be often caught out by double falsebreaks, and hence losses on both buy/sell stops. Disaster.  
  
However, I think there's a way around this. In backtesting, my rules and assumptions are:  
  
(1) EUR/USD;  
(2) Use Middle Box tramlines to set buy/sell stops;  
(3) Enter orders only _**at or around 11am NY time**_ ;  
(4) TP & SL of 40pips;  
(5) Monday and Friday are generally hit & miss...must use discretion if deciding to enter;  
(6) If the Middle Box pip range itself is greater than 60, I do not trade.  
(7) If the pip gap (between the Middle Box and the price at 11am NY time) is greater than 60, I do not trade. However, if its less than 60, I open an instantaneous order in the trend direction with TP and SL of 20.  
  
The results are that:  
(a) good pips may be obtained on Tuesdays to Thursdays, and maybe some Fridays - probably average two +40 orders hit for the week;  
(b) it is definitely much easier to hit +20 at least 3 days a week (than compared to +40) entering the market after 11am NY time;  
(c) Mondays are not generally good for the Middle Box breakout;  
(d) on successful days where +20 and +40 are hit, the drawdowns do not generally get too much more than -25 to -30; and  
(e) strategy seems to work best when 11am price is still sitting inside Middle Box range.  
  
I think this strategy should net about 60-100 pips on EUR/USD regularly per week. I've only backtested about 10 weeks of EUR/USD and it looks promising on other USD pairs too.  
  
**Can someone please help stress-test this approach (also on USD/CHF given the strong correlation and other USD pairs) and confirm whether this approach pulls in regular pips per week....  
**  
Someone might also want to double check that the JPY crosses do not really work on this strategy.  
  
Cheers and keep the up the good work guys,  
Chngster

But I see form another thread which talks also on Big Dog Breakout, the technique is to draw 3 or 4 hours prior to the GBP Opening? My way of doing is 4am to 7am and I realize its very accurate, Cause most breakouts happen around 7.45 - 8.30 and they are very predicatable and obvious? Also, If I were to draw the box from 7am to 9am, I would have missed a lot of opportunities as...

Chngster,   
You're right on the double false breakout, usually it will go up then down then up again.. Thats why I set TP of 30-40 pips when I'm trading using middle box. Cause most of the time it hits TP then only reverse trend. Actually, if you know that it will reverse, why don't you wait for the reversal then trade? Anyways, what is 11am NY time for GMT+8?

GMT+8 is exactly 12 hours faster than NY time.  
  
ie. 7am NY time is 7pm your time.

I am still using this system with relative success. I've recorded my results this month of December and will share them in the new year. I'm waiting till the end of the month to look through the data and see which days, hours and ranges perform the best.  
  
I could tell you know though that this month the GBP/USD is much more profitable than the EUR/USD pair.  
  
I'll post results at the end of the month.  
Best,

Here you go.  
I missed the first 4 days of the month.  
  
Price/Pivot Point = the price of the pair at 9:14:59 in relation to the daily pivot.  
  
In regards to 'Account Balance' - the number in parentheses is the amount had I calculated days where the range was more than 50. The first number is the account balance of trades placed only when the range was 50 pips or less.  
  
Best,

what is your box time range for london? what is your SL and TPs? how do you manage exiting to minimize lossing trades?

they should be the fib levels as in the very first post on this thread, i also trade the london breakout and was using fib levels for TPs on that untl i found this variation method as i have been tradign the NY box for way longer then the london box, i am testing this on demo for 7 days but the xl Spreadhseet of results looks pretty good for december in what was a difficult month for breakout trades overall

Hey,  
  
TP1 is equal to the number of pips between the entry level and the first profit target  
TP 2 and TP 3 are likewise the number of pips between the entry and the profit target.   
  
These profit targets were established by using the Fibonacci levels that the originator of this thread posted in the very first post.  
  
Hope that clears things up.

Hey,  
  
The first 2/3rds of the month were strong for the NY box using GBP/USD. Then the markets fell into the Christmas/New Years/end of year craziness mode, so I don't give much credence to any of the results from the final third of the month.  
  
I'm going to really pour through these results on January 17th, when I have time during a long flight overseas. I've also recorded the london breakout using two different timeframes - 22:00 to 1:00 and 00:00 to 3:00 (EST) and two pairs - EUR/USD and GBP/USD  
I will record the results of my analysis onto a spreadsheet which should be ready by the 20th of this month.  
  
  
  
Best,   
-Adam

Hi,   
  
Interesting thread. There appear to be a number of offshoots of the original system Lucashammer highlighted with people suggesting different stops, different money management, size of box filter etc but has anyone any actual long terms results from Live trading (not backtest or demo) of any of these. For a system that a fair number of people seem to be suggesting works quite well there seems to be very little in the way of stats (apart from December). These types of systems have habit of having some good months which lure people into thinking it works but then have long row of months when it doesn't. I'm certainly interested in trying this out but has anyone got ongoing results?  
  
thanks,  
Justin
