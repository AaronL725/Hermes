Hi everybody,  
today I would like to share with you a strategy that I took a few months to thin .. to the eye it is very simple, based on renko 10pips box charts ...  
I started in December in assembling a good strategy, putting together some indicators, being very careful not to overdo it in filling the chart, and to date I can say that I have found an excellent system capable of bringing home, from 200 to 500 pips per week, following 3 simple rules.  
  
I am also seriously thinking about using this new system as a second job.  
  
but there are some angles to smooth about some indicators. problems can be solved by some good programmer if someone is available and kind.  
  
these little tricks shown in the images, which once corrected ... would make the system far better. (_for example the bands slow down the pc a lot_)  
  
in any case, if anyone has any idea of improvements .. adjustments, or replacements of indicators, any idea will be welcome.  
**strictly all based on renko of course.!**  
  
**GUYS... I UPDATED THE SYSTEM !!!!! - 01/05/2020**

Want to "improve" your renko strategy??  
  
Easy..  
  
_Read RENKO_ and what its telling you; as soon as you do that you can remove ALL indicators right away (they become useless/redundant) maybe just a momentum oscillator to backup what you are watching on the price  
  
Dont put your faith in "indicators" to tell you when to enter/exit a trade.. its dumb, noob and will get you no where  
  
After all you can not get any more accurate that reading price in itself and RENKO its stupid accurate once you know how to do it  
  
Good luck

I have left out some details:  
I use a VPS, and I receive the halftrend signals, I enter my vps from my smartphone, and in 10 seconds I see whether to enter the market. this is because I need to speed up my trading, I don't have the possibility to be in front of the pc all day. moreover, I started trading in 2006, I can read the price, putting together some indicators does not mean not knowing how to read the price, it means (FOR ME) speeding up the market entry procedure. that's all. and so far after 2 months of trades with this strategy ... it has worked great.  
the way to be a trader, is ALWAYS ALWAYS Subjective !!

I've always had interest in Renko charts and i do believe if proper time is invested into it, it can be a very profitable trading method/strategy...your strategy looks good (haven't tried it yet) but i would like to know how the TMA bands works, do they re-adjust?

ah ok, thats different; if you are using those indis as "heads up" kind of alerts AND THEN you are the one deciding if its valid or not then its fine.. yea not everyone van be in front of a PC for a long time (not needed anyway honestly even using renko)  
  
and no, trading its NOT "subjective" at all !!! the market speaks CLEARLY if its a good moment to enter or not, plain and simple.. the price tells you that with NO "subjectivity" at all

I notice you have semafors on your chart. Repainting indicators are generally bad for trading. Have you had any issues with this?

Maybe you can give some details? I like Renko from the pictures I see, but always I tried they my own it was not very successful. You wrote "Read RENKO and what its telling you" - can you explain that?

no no problem ... we all know that it is the same as a zigzag, but it is an indicator, and as such indicates the peak of the price reached, then as explained in the screenshots it is necessary to observe the other indicators, semafor is just one of the other confirmations for enter the market.

the bands are not repaint ... I have always found all the conditions in real time within the two bands, including the conditions for entering the market. the only indicators definitely NOT repaint are:  
halftrend mladen  
the bands  
spearman pre smoothed  
the rest, even if reapaint ... help in putting together the entry rules.  
  
this screenshot, for example, is taken right now and I am waiting for an entry confirmation:

I like the system and logic using the envelope trend lines instead of the usual Bollinger bands. Are the indicators that you use standard issue in MetaQuotes or are they custom built? Where can they be down-loaded from?

Only one of them, SemaforAlert, is not stolen, decompiled code.  
Also the ram heaviness is probably due to the PriceBorder code calling its own EA or self through iCustom <https://docs.mql4.com/indicators/icustom>  

Inserted Code
    
    
    Gs_148 = WindowExpertName();
    ...
    Gda_132[Li_4] = iCustom(NULL, Gi_164, Gs_148, "calculateTma", HalfLength, Price, ATRMultiplier, ATRPeriod, 0, Li_44);

I didn't get mad, just pointing out that saying what people should do when you yourself probably suck at it make no sense. Take your own advice before telling them to others - that's it, it will make your life better and others too.

ITs easy my friend.. well, lets say "simple" instead of easy because people in general doesnt like to hear that word + trading in the same sentence =)  
  
Renko its just a bunch of price "blocks" of certain pip size (chosen by you) correct? you have an Open/High/Low/Close right? _that relationship between_ OHLC (and what it means the price its doing) gives you clues of what the markets its going to do next; when you can read 1 candle, you can read a group of candle and forecast where the price its going with a high degree of accuracy.. SIMPLE but of course needs some practice  
  
Once you can do that you can literally see the market turning around (like a swing trader likes) OR keep moving in 1 direction (like "trend traders like lol), you just need to wait for it  
  
a loss/gain of momentum/impulse its all you need to maybe confirm what you are looking in the chart... the OP its using BANDS, wich its a way to find the price "max" extensions on a given moment and confirm if its a good moment to enter or not, thats it =)

I take my own advice every single day, exactly how i posted !! what makes you think i dont? maybe you should try and stablish a conversation first before making assumptions about someone dont you think? after all you never know who are you talking too or what kind of experience that person have in the first place.  
  
_I have a lot of experience with renko, i tried everything in the past, you name it, ive done it (literally) and i can explain why it works/doesnt, im always open to help others with a good attitude (key word)_  
  
  
ASK AWAY, im willing to contribute =)

Guys,sorry jumping in without permission  
"**PriceBorder** " is "**centered TMA bands** " originally,repainter  
"**RenkoStreet_channel** " is "**Donchain channel"** originally but edited/coded badly and hides parameters on purpose (misleading) - shifted back -12 per - apply donchain with per 24 and shift back -12 for highlow and see,in example pic both applied and are overlapping  
Halftrend and spear rc are much OK  
when users trading with the help and guide by indicators,they follow indicators formation,it means depending on,so misleading (i means telling something wrong way/repainting) the user that results to loss --- but you can go ahead how you like and what suits you  
what i feel and say always when there are already so many things and features related to online trading are at risk,at least use reliable indicators

If you thinking and hoping some alternative to that band there is no till now and never be in future even,when you remove that repainting part to make it **nrp** this will not give you that display/formation alike that attractive but misleading  
as per Mladen's saying "**nrp of centered tma is lwma** " bands but display will be different

ASk yourself this question:  
  
what are you measuring with bands? what info are they telling you??  
  
you are trying to pick the price extreme right?? what other way you have to do it? there are a few more consistent and reliable ways to do it but like always, it needs to be backed by reading the price to confirm its the right moment

Figured out the problem, you have to make sure you copy over the .ex4 file and not the mq4 one. it usually works with either but should work after that.

Carefull with that: that picture its 2 options, either based on ATR (useless) OR chosing a "timeframe" for calculation, both WILL give you a wrong chart !!  
  
dont be deceived by how "pretty and clean" it looks, that chart its flawed/not right

Do you trade all 28 pairs with this method? and if so, if you are already in a couple trades of the same pair for instance you're in EURUSD & EURJPY already and you get a valid EURGBP signal would you also take that trade? And thank you for sharing your method.

Lots different from my renko style  
I also use 10 pip bricks  
looking at the spearman indicator set to Rank=7 Its renko indicators seem to work better with smaller settings 7 is my favourite  
  
when turns blue look at long when orange look at sell

Hello Valdecchio,  
Thanks for your interesting thread. Can you tell me please the line on your chart that follows the market closely turning red and green. What indicator is that???

being very stubborn .. (until I get to my goal I won't stop) I'm continuing to refine the strategy ..  
I found this indicator which unfortunately is in ex4, would any of you know how to find it with the code open? I have searched all the forums in the world and on the web but I can't find it anywhere else.  
I propose this indicator because from what I have noticed it does not seem to be repaint, on several occasions I have observed the signals and the arrows do not seem to move, not even reloading the indicator on the graph. a flaw is that it has no type of alert. it would be exceptional if it continued to confirm itself not repaint this week. meanwhile, it could be used as a filter in halftrend signals. however I hope that some of you have this indicator in mq4.

Initial system seemed pretty interesting so I opened a renko chart and have the indi's and EA running just to see what it does. I notice, however, there's no options for setting the lot size of the position it opens. Does the EA have its own way of calculating lot size per position? Just curious. Thank you for sharing your work, Valdecchio.

the EA does not carry out any trade, you decide the lot size manually .. the EA manages only your trades, ie inserts TP and SL automatically, inserts breakeven and trailingstop automatically.!

Ahh okay, I misunderstood and thought it was a fully automated move-opening EA. Thank you for clarifying. I'm a big Renko fan and it does lay out signals very nicely. I'll be sure to use it for my renko trading. If I knew more coding I'd try to automate the whole thing but alas I know nothing of the sort. The addition of the TMA Centered indi is nice too as it provides support the other signals. All in all, good work.

I AM TOTALLY AGREE ... my goal is to find a combination of indicators that give signals, as accurate as possible, so as to achieve a system at least 90% effective, which is comfortable, which allows you to sleep peacefully at night, and that above all bring you a weekly / monthly salary.  
I'd like you to stay in this discussion to find the best combination of indicators and settings to apply.

I found this in my directory, I don't use it but it's supposed to be a non repaint. NRP in the name.

yes TMA repaints.  
but your renko chart isn't right. you're on MT4 ? it's not posible to make accurate renko charts on MT4 because you need to access tick data inside a candle to draw accurate renko bars

Nice, can you share your indicator in a zip and tpl?  
How do you enter at market? What rules do you follow?

I thing before to use RENKO it is better to read:  
  
BEYOND CANDLESTICKS book BY STEVE NISON   
  
RENKO CHAPTER 7  
  
TRADING TECHNIQUES WITH RENKO CHARTS  
  
Unlike the varied trading techniques applicable with three-line break  
charts and kagi charts (discussed in the next chapter), the renko charts  
are more limited. The only trend reversal signals with renko charts are  
with the emergence of a bullish white brick or bearish black brick. Buv  
and sell signals based on this technique are shown in Exhibit 7.2.  
As shown in that exhibit, buy signals (shown by the letter B) are  
generated with the appearance of a white brick. Sell signals (shown by  
S) are produced when a black brick appears. since the renko chart is a  
trend-following technique, there will be times when the market is in a  
lateral trading band. In such an environment there may be whipsaws  
(see B1-S1, Be-Ss, and Ba-Sf. However, the expectation with a trend-  
following technique such as this is that it allows traders to ride on the  
major portion of the trend. This is shown by the buy and sell signals  
produced at 82-52, Bs-Ss, and B5-Su.

that chapter its completely FLAWED from start to finish.. that its NOT how you read renko and certainly thats not how you enter the market with them  
  
in my opinion that was more than a filler chapter based on hot air than anything else because, again, it doesnt hold true and its completely flawed logic in live trading conditions

No need to read all. Only the first post.   
  
If you want and if the platform allows, you can insert Renko candles.

everyone has the right to express an opinion, and their own ideas ... but ... please, stop discouraging other traders by imposing your ideas and strategies! the task of each trader is to help and advise, but not to impose his ideas like a jackhammer ... and discourage other strategies you don't like .. in this thread we try to find the best setting for a peaceful trading , easy, and stress-free .. let people focus on their goal !! and not on the goals of others.

Hi Havo, beyond this point do you have any materials which I could read and understand. Or at least what to look for, PA what I have read talk about OHLC, but not byond this point(or how to forecast the next candle).

Mmm hard to say but depends on what you have read until now you could be on the right track already.. or not..  
  
The best way to confirm that its to write down what its OHLC to you and watch a renko chart and see if holds true or not.. and then you can start from there

My 2 cents is that it's not a good idea to use renko without wicks.

Yes !! you are missing a very critical info without the wicks present.. they are VERY important to enter the market and for move confirmation

This is a bit of a blow. I am addicted to renko and I dont use wicks but refer to 5 min and 15 min "normal" charts as a guide so I guess i'll just sit on my 20 pips from last euro session and shut up.  
  
Sure the market is crazy at the moment next month will be crazier because the figures will be lousy I am not sure if the market has taken these into account yet so we will see.  
  
Not saying it is easy but renko paints a pretty clear picture of where the market MAY go.

I have never found a need for wicks but I do watch all time frames on Candle charts...I guess one must find what suits them best

I had good results with this strategy over the past few days. Are you using your own Price Border indicator or one of the TMAs shared here by other members?

I'm glad you had good results ... can you post your statement to make everyone participate?  
I am still working with the same indicators, with the bands .. because they help (visually) to understand when a trend is about to end .. and there will be an inversion ... the losses are obvious, they are always but I am looking for to filter market revenue as much as possible.

the renko charts don't have timeframes... you can only choose which chart to build the renko chart in the options: file / Open without connection

In your system, is Renko chart required?   
I couldn't make Renko with your EA so I used alternative indicator - STG_RenkoChart which generate offline Renko chart.  
  
  
  
I am very interested in your settings as it looks very promising.  
I am willing to work with you to fix/improve your indicators/systems if needed.  
  
For this, I have modified TMA ATR band to include two bands so that you can reduce at least one indicator.  
This should give identical band and You can turn on/off center line as needed also.

what do you mean nothing happens?  
selecting the template should automatically set everything in the graph.  
unless you've copied indicators and EAs to different folders.

not bad .. I modified it as you see, with the colors and lines, thank you very much ..  
just one detail ... have you made any changes to lighten the Ram? many other similar indicators already with only 3 charts loaded, weigh down the PC.

Nope.   
  
Just quick checking now, TMA is not the cause of slowing down.   
  
1\. halftrend - it has 1 loop Bars -1 - so every tick, it will loop whole bar. Also, it has many call itself.  
we might be able to change this so that it only once per bar.  
  
2\. SemaforAlerts - It has Bars-1 - so every tick, whole bar is recounted.  
this one has 4 loops - 4 times load.  
we might be able to change this also so that runs it only once per bar.  
  
3\. Spearman Rank - not resource hungry.  
  
mainly, semaforalerts is resource hungry - as it is variation of ZigZag x 3 times.  
  

Since you are looking for halftrend signal, we don't need SemaphoreAlerts to be "up-to-date".

We might be just change 1 indicator only and get performance boost.

I did modify code and compared how it performs - limiting Bar to 1000 and also, once a bar.  
however, it didn't help much.  
  
It seems each pair added to chart adds about 80MB of memory.  
Since I have a couple of extra indicator, it might be a bit lower for you.  
  
Regardless of bar limit or not, CPU was spiking around 11% when high and around 2-3% when idle or slow time when it is not calculating.  
  
One way to reduce this mem seems to use higher time frame.   
When using 1M TF, mem/CPU usage was highest and it reduces when it was H1 or higher.  
Please note this doesn't include Renko Chart - it might add extra memory.  
  
if you are using VPS, most of those are virtual machine - means it will run slower when there is a lot of disk read/write.  
  
You might want to upgrade VPS spec - to more Mem and Higher CPU spec - which will cost more.   
but, since it is business expense to make more money, I am sure it is something to consider.

ok perfect .... so in your opinion is it worth trying to improve (in the way you listed) these indicators? i am testing as a filter for market entries,  
the macd with set: 65-75-35  
it doesn't look bad! this week I'll try it!  
thank you very much for your interest and your commitment! you see that you are interested in achieving my same goal.  
Thank you very much. let's not stop!

This is my recommendation:  
Since you are looking only top/bottom signal in the zone as signal and get into trade with Halftrend signal, you can remove few indicators.  
1\. Set 2 unused "SemaphorAlert" periods to 0 - first 2 as 0. - this will reduce 2/3 of processing and memory.  
* Now I see CPU usage is reduced by more than 1/2  
  
try first.  
if that is not enough, remove Remove RenkoStreet_Channel - this is also redundant.

I solved it .. I had an EA to generate the old Renko, and it was loading the CPU too much, I inserted a recent one found here on FF. and now it flows like oil! now we just have to smooth the corners of this strategy ... we would have to fix the "Quick TRailing" ea manager but it's not so urgent .. now I'm focusing on how to best filter the hallftrend signals, in order to reduce to the minimum possible losing signals.

Go to the first post, I updated the system. I added a script that will help speed up the Renko chart building procedure.  
I noticed that many do not yet know how MT4 works ... so I have prepared a folder with 10 screenshots inside with the explanation step by step !!!! (IMPOSSIBLE WRONG!)**

you were wrong, you don't have to use that EA to build the renko chart.  
go to the first post and download the new version of the program .. with that you can't go wrong .. it's child proof 4 years![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Dear Valdecchino !  
  
Thanks for all for the effort about your thread. I really like it, will follow you and test the system from the next week.  
Some questions: How many pairs do you monitor ? Are there pairs working better ?  
Do you use 10 pips of brick size for all pairs ?   
Thanks  
  
Szabolcs

As i said in the first post, my goal to reach is to have an easy system even for a baby of 5yo, who does not involve spending hours doing technical analysis, (which has tired me after years) and bring this system to become the salary machine.  
in the future I intend to quit my job and earn my living only from treding. But being a soldier of the Italian army, my character as a defender of the population, forces me to share something that can help others, especially in this moment when this world is rotten.  
and once all of you have this tool to bring home what you need to live, you don't have to worry about anything else .. there will be no wars, pandemics that can close the markets .. forex has existed for thousands of years and it is not a shop that can go bankrupt or close forever.  
having said that ... thank you for the compliments.  
you will automatically find the bricks at 5 pips, as I noticed that you can get more entry opportunities for each chart, there are no pairs that work better than another, you can also open 50 charts, if you want ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) (you must have a powerful computer to be able to open dozens) I personally have 8 open, I could reach 15 if you want, but other couples have too high [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide"). satisfied with a maximum of 10 ... there will not be a single day without having made at least 50 pips![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Your system looks very promising. Thank you for sharing and for your patience in teaching us how to use it.  
A question. I saw that EA Quick_Trailing is already included in the system, according to your experience what is the best configuration to use it? I saw that it is to define SL, TP and trailling step.

thank you very much for your words ... knowing that this simple and elementary system is appreciated by many, gives me the energy to improve it more and more.  
you don't have to configure anything. loading with the template everything is ready to use .. if you prefer to change TP and SL, you can change it as you wish .. but everything else is already set.

Can you then just tell us how we can read Renko perhaps .. but I do agree that Renko with wicks gives you better picture

Valdecchio, interesting thread, I have done a lot of work with renko in the past, also using some similar indicators as you, trying to keep it clean and simple. Quick question, why have you stopped using the spearman indicator? Are you able to post that indicator as I would like to do some testing with it and can report back once I'm done.  
  
Thanks!

because it did not give me a precise filtering as I look for it ... in some cases, it did not give harmonious rules for market entry, thus skipping many profitable opportunities to invest.

avoid him ... to explain how to read the wicks ... he sells his system! in this thread (which I created myself) there is no mention of selling systems, indicators, etc. .. if you want to share a system .. you do it for FREE !!!! and together we try to improve it ... he continues to insist that the renko only trade in his way ... and then take you to sell you his system .. so please ... let's not talk about this talk anymore.

Hi, I am testing your system, I really like the new graphic even if the support and resistance bars dirty the graphic and the side writings are a little messy, on Monday I will test it thoroughly. ps. I seem to have understood that you are Italian (like me).

Hi, if i want to upload on a new currency chart, can i just drag and drop the pair on the window (where i already set everything) or should i do all the steps again for the new currency?  
  
E.g. I already set USDCHF with your steps described in the zip file, i want to check EURUSD now, can i just drag and drop EURUSD on USDCHF or i need to do all the steps for EUR USD again? Many thanks in advace

Nop, you have to set it up as you initially did on the first chart. Choose you best pairs but be sure you have a strong machine to avoid lowering your computer"s speed. thanks

Just load semefore*.ex4 instead of .mq4, it do not compile in my mt4 and do not load. Copy .ex4 & restart or refresh mt4 then reload the template, that worked for me.

Hi Valdecchio,  
  
i have a question, When the renko bars surpasses the upper band and there is a short signal, do you wait for the renk bars to cross below the upper band then enter or you just enter when a short signal has been confirmed regardless ? thanks 

How can i loose when i started from the bottom!?

Just joined and this is my first post.  
This is slightly off topic but might help with what he is trying to do.  
I was originally trained in forex but traded oil futures for a while using tombars, similar to renko bars. I really liked using them but one of the things I wished they would do is show volume and range. The way this could be achieved is have them set up with range as well as volume limits to each bar. The benefit of this is that the high volume areas would be very apparent as the bars would start stacking across the chart, either straight or bounce up and down due to range. The second benefit would be the secondary indicators like EMAs or Bollingers would either stay in the same configuration meaning a small supply or demand zone or would move due to a larger zone helping you to prepare for a trade. A change in direction would be much more visible and a bounce would also be recognized as well.

There is a tma real indicator which for the last 6 or so bars is nearly as good and doesn't repaint as far as I am aware. I have like a previous post used lwma and hlc/4 or something like that.

1º- if you had read my first post, you would not have arrived in this thread saying that this system (assembled) will lose money, you have not tested it.  
  
2nd - you are dirtying this thread of negativity, the goal (at least mine and I think of everyone) is the goal you find in my first post, and to get to that goal we are all working together to find simple indicators (even the most stupid and ridiculous find free online, and better settings to minimize any losses.

4th - if you think ... without having tried this strategy for at least a month, that makes you lose money ... thanks for letting us know ... we continue to test it and stubbornly believe it, believe it always and in any case .. anyway ... my goal is to reach a system that gives me, and my neighbor, the possibility of bringing home a salary easily and without stress, without scams, without deceit, without cheating ... if a system makes money money ... no need to sell anything!  
  
4- this message is addressed to you, and anyone who wants to discredit the dreams of others, diminish a great deal of research by those who believe in their goal, trying to throw down all the dreams of those who want to fulfill their desires **...stop repeating that this system will make lose money ... unless you can prove it!**

the arrows send a signal once the box is complete, once the arrow with the complete box appears it sends a signal .. and after that, it does not disappear .. that halftrend indicator is NOT repaint. so always wait for the indicator to send you a signal, then enter the market.

thanks [valdecchio](https://www.forexfactory.com/valdecchio), i entered GU and eurusd trade, GU gave me 20 pips i closed it manually as soon as the opposing sell signals popped up from the above, am still in eurusd with a little loss seems to be ranging at the moment hopefully it will rise amd hit take profit, the problem is that MACD might soon go below 0 level. Am i supposed to closed on little loss or profit when i was on buy but macd goes down to below 0 level?

Mistake that I was making over the weekend trying to create renko charts: remembered one crucial thing: _**keep the initial 1 min chart open (do not delete it after you open an offline chart)**_. Thus, you should have two charts for the same pair - the 1 min chart where you uploaded history and the template "create renko chart" and the offline 4m chart which should then be updating.

This system seems to be working well during the london and newyork session! but you have to be full time glued on your screen to take trades and exit when you notice a trend change, otherwise i like it! So far so good! will keep testing it for the rest of the month i see how it goes!

hello I agree with you ... I have been stopped for 3 days, because of the work ... I have only read your last comments now ... in fact .. I agree with you ... MAYBE, replace macd for having more precise signs of entry, and above all some combination of indicators that warn us when a trend is about to change .. I'm continuing to work to find the winning combination ...  
I don't stop!

hi Angie T, can you share your template with a description of how to use it? MACD is too slow and hence a lot of opportunities being lost 

How can i loose when i started from the bottom!?

too difficult to share sorry  
  
Although if you use semafore AND the arrows fron mladens code halftrend then this should be enough keeping it simple

I was working with 3 different strategies so statement wouldn't really reflect anything meaningful. But now I have setup a demo account for this strategy alone because it is simple, has shown promise and makes sense to me. I use it without Renko Street channel indicator because it has no use. I am also not sure of Quicktrail EA because my stoploss is not fixed and is just above the last swing. But I am struggling with determining an appropriate TP (suggestions are welcome). I am also using it both with and without Renko.  
  
All in all, your system has so far shown promise and I will be forward-testing this strategy in the coming weeks.  
  
Thank You.

Why is it to difficult to share. After all you are using someone else's code. Just upload. Takes 2 minutes.

Hi, I really appreciate the step by step to set up the renko chart on MT4. It would have been really confusing otherwise, very well done. Thank you.   
  
I try to add confluence to the signals provided in the Renko by checking the order flow and price action on the Candlestick chart. for example buyer/seller weakness, Divergence, support and resistance. Its great because I now have to only focus on those once the signal is shown on the Renko.   
  
Cheers!

thanks ced87 it is more about hijacking this thread and confusing people. I have a distinct trading style and indicators are only a guide.  
Some of the code is MINE and I don't mind sharing but my whole set of indicators with settings wow I am here to trade and help where I can.  
  
I mean my charts look great in retrospect but the hard right edge takes skill and using semafore I lost 400$ on friday just gone so licking my wounds and refining my skill.

Hello,  
Congratulations. Nice results.   
Did you use 5 brick size or 10 ? To check so many pairs, did not slow down your PC ?  
Thanks Sz

I just follow the trade setup as explained at post #120 then post the result. No need to brag, this is only testing result in demo account to see if this strategy will yield good result.

Well thank you. I'll try to summarize: You are using the rules in the attached image. Renko bars 10. Do you trade on 17 pairs as you have in the picture, or on 10 pairs?

I filter 28 pairs with this setup and limit my trades to 10 pairs (max) only at a time. I placed 15-25 stoploss and would normally take 30-70 pips. I have not yet tried to let the winners run beyond 100 pips.

I tried your system for this past 2 weeks on demo account to see its potential but I will test for more. Win-rate is 50-60% for below 10% drawdown.  
I think about 90% that I followed the entry rules, so I need to improve more my self-discipline. I confirm also my entries on important price levels (weekly pivot/S&R/S&D).

thank you very much friend ... are you testing the latest system model that I updated in the first post? I ask, because as I said, lately I have no possibility to constantly test the system because of the work, and your testimonials, about defects, advice, corrections are very important to me. let me know which model you are using ... next week I will add the old model (the first one, with a "spearman" indicator so as to keep an archive of the evolution of the system) thank you very much again for your testimony, for the indicator !! WE MUST NOT STOP !!!

I removed the spearman and macd from the system. I added Awesome which is faster and make use of the ADR marker.   
The result is promising.  
My first week was a 2% loss (not fully concentrating), The second week was a 2% gain and the third week was 2% gain with a drawdown of 1.1% on the account

Hey everyone.  
The system is great and have been working on an almost identical setup. Concept is basically the same. Firstly l use MathTrader7 renko chart creator which has been very stable so far available in FF. l also use TMA+CG by Mladen which does not repaint. My main contribution would be in the area of filtering, basically l use  
Trendflex indicator for that which can be a great filter.  
l use the Oracle indicator just for a visual cross, was using a non repaint Semafor before and it gave late confirmation and the repainting ones are honestly deceitful and will give false confidence in my opinion.  
Lastly l also use daily and weekly pivot levels as well. l hope this improves the system further. l actually believe this system can now be automated at this point.

> Hey everyone. The system is great and have been working on an almost identical setup. Concept is basically the same. Firstly l use MathTrader7 renko chart creator which has been very stable so far available in FF. l also use TMA+CG by Mladen which does not repaint. My main contribution would be in the area of filtering, basically l use Trendflex indicator for that which can be a great filter. l use the Oracle indicator just for a visual cross, was using a non repaint Semafor before and it gave late confirmation and the repainting ones are honestly...

The concept is the same thats why l just attached alternative indicators which have helped improve my system, which l have been piecing together for months.  
ln my opinion that Trendflex indicator was the game changer for me and its very user friendly with just two settings.  
That said l basically look for crosses outside the bands and wait for trendflex to confirm the move.

Please pardon my asking, what is the histogram indicator on your main chart, what are the settings and is it possible to share it here?  
  
Thanks for your contribution.

Hi  
Are you sure coz l have been testing and using it for over a month now and it doesnt repaint, been literally watching the screen when setups develop. You should note though that firstly there is the issue of renko bars recalculating everytime you close and reopen the terminal as offline experts recalibrate using historical data. Then also you need to wait for candle close as well. So l am not sure how you came to the conclusion it repaints. Kindly explain coz maybe theres something l miss during screen time.

hello,  
  
i didnt checked with reko chart rather with normal chart to find out weather it repaint or not. please check below images, in 1st image u can see upper band touched by 1h candle then price goes down and after few hour later it goes up again and with the upward move upper band also sifted by few pips ( check 2nd image marking 1) and in marking 2 section there were a huge downward slop and if u check the trajectory of the band you will under stand that price should touch the lower band way earlier but it curved down and when price retracted it moves up ward and touch the bottom of candle.   
  
in last 6-9 months i tried 5-7 bands and checked very carefully every band shifts its position. if u wan i can share those bands here. i think only one band i found which dose not repaint but that is hard to use bcz of so many false breakouts (if u use narrow band) or almost no signal(due to wide settings).

TMA is repainting MA. There is no norepainting tma. Otherwise it's not TMA.  
If using LWMA, the band behaves like a keltner channel or ATR bands.  
Even GeorgeAU is talking all the time TMA, but using "keltner channel" with LWMA.

Hello Valdecchio, how are you? I hope well. First of all I would like to thank you for sharing your system, thank you very much. I would like to ask, if you could share this MACD, because I downloaded the new system, and this one without. Thank you

Hi Valdecchio, i'm italian too. i have a question: the EA QUIK TRAILING, is to set in a same way or is yet setted in the right mode for this strategy? i want to test it this week. is it possible to change the lenght of the renko bars? for example to set them for 3 pips each or the amount of pips i decided? i ask this because in some pairs 4 pips bar are too much and in others (like the GBP's) are too small.  
i decided to use the TRENDFLEX indicator instead of the MACD because it seems much more reactive.. what do you think?  
Thanks

> 
> Ignored

the Macd used in this system is the default MACD from MT4 ... it is not an indicator found on the web. you should have it already in your mt4. and with the system template it should load automatically. if this does not happen, perhaps you have deleted macd from your indicators from mt4

in this thread the same explanations are being repeated a thousand times, the offline timeframe renko DOES NOT EXIST H4 !!!!!  
repeat the instructions step by step ... if other users have succeeded ... evidently I have made the explanation elementary enough ... if in the screenshots you see a certain thing ... do not do another different one!

Hi valdecchio, thank for your system I'm testing it right now and jumped in a LONG trade at AUDCAD.  
If I'm correct this trade met all the rules to enter a LONG trade, only how do you know when to exit a trade?  
  
Oh and do you need to keep the M1 charts open or can I close those?

yes you have to keep the charts open at 1m. otherwise the renko chart is deactivated.  
when you select the template, tp and sl is already preset by the EA (Quick Trailing) .. as the profit flows, he will think about blocking the profit, and autonomously activate the trailing stop to follow the profits along the trend.  
you do not have to do anything.

**Guyss !!!!!!  
my spasmodic search, led me to find a combination of indicators, which is not only profitable with roars of pips, but AVOID (and this was one of my main objectives) to enter the wrong trades, that is, when a signal arrives , and instead has a very short trend, which would go to take the SL. in this way you avoid these trades, and therefore you get long trends!  
I still don't want to explain the rules for superstition ... but don't worry, I'll be back next Friday with the results. I don't want to shout victory again .. I managed to find this combination only 3 days ago, and in the meantime the demo account has expired. so I have trade, only today 29.05.2020.  
(the 3 small losing trades were my distractions not respecting the rules.)  
stay tuned !![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f37b.png?v=15.1)**

Usually the channel indicators like TMA etc... are repainting and if they don't than they don't give good entry signals.  
I hope your combination of indicators perform nicely on live real accounts.

Hi,  
  
I´ve also started studing and testing this promising system.  
If I understood correctly, we must open according to the Traffic light (semafore) and the MACD.   
What about clossing? Does the EA handle SL and TP automatically? Do I need to modify the EA parameters? (It means we only have to care about opening order and nothing else.) Am I correct?  
  
Thanks!

Just a word of caution: The Traffic light (semafore) repaint when price makes new high. And if this happen, your SL can get hit. This happen frequently in high volatility price movement. You can try it on M1 chart (using Demo account) to see how it behave in high volatile price movement.

That's exactly the problem with this system. It can be profitable and might work even better for more experienced traders out there but to be able to filter out many of the false signals would be golden.  
  
Waiting for Vald's improvements to the system....

Just signed up in this website to write in this thread. I'm just wondering... Why do you share your strategy to the public? Do you not realize that by sharing your strategy with other people, the performace of your strategy will degrade as more and more people take away your alpha? Or do you not care about your strategy losing its effectiveness?

Do you not realize that by sharing your strategy with other people, the performace of your strategy will degrade as more and more people take away your alpha? Or do you not care about your strategy losing its effectiveness?

Do you think his strategy control the world market? Do you think banks and institutes watch his renko chart for buy and sell?

hi,  
  
this could be also a useful indicator. It is nonrepaint and the arrow appear when the price touch the cloud. Unfortunately, the price can go further but combined with other indicator could be a good sign to enter.

You don't know why and how the price moves, do you?  
  
Price moves because of imbalance between supply and demand.  
  
A trading strategy's entire purpose is to identify buy/sell opportunities that arise from the imbalance between supply and demand.  
  
Now imagine multiple people using his strategies to buy and sell around similar times as OP does. The supply and demand balance will change, price will adjust to this change and start moving in a different pattern and OP's strategy will progressively lose its effectiveness as more and more people copy his strategy.  
  
Doesn't matter if it's forex, stocks, crypto, this is how the market moves.  
  
For more detailed explanation on how the price moves, how it's affected by supply and demand, check this site: [https://www.disnat.com/en/learning/t...d%20is%20easy.](https://www.disnat.com/en/learning/trading-basics/stock-basics/what-causes-stock-prices-to-change#:~:text=Stock%20prices%20change%20everyday%20by%20market%20forces.&text=If%20more%20people%20want%20to,supply%20and%20demand%20is%20easy.) (Edit: I just realized this link is more focused on stock markets, but the essence of supply and demand and their relationship with the price movement is the same in forex, or any other asset type for that matter.)  
  
OP, if you want to use this strategy to make a living for a long time, take this thread down and keep your strategy a secret and never tell others your trading strategy.  
  
Trading is a zero-sum game. That means in order for you to gain money, someone else has to lose their money. (in fact, if you consider the transaction fee, trading is not even a zero-sum game; it's a net-negative game.) All other traders are your competitor whether they like it or not. By sharing your strategy with other people online, you are literally helping your competitors who are out to take your profit and doing yourself a huge disservice.

I actually feel sorry for OP. He's a good person with a good intention and want to help other people live a better life with his strategy, but he does not realize he's actually destroying his strategy by sharing it with others here.  
  
OP, if you wanna help out other people in this world, keep your strategy a secret and donate money to local charity, rather than telling your trading strategy with random people online.

I think you do not understand the intention of this forum. It IS for sharing and discussing strategies, indicators, EAs...  
Do you think, that this small community here has more influence than a pubic hair in the ocean? The are zillions of $$$ going around in the forex world every day, even central banks cannot really influence the rates. And you think that our $2.50 here would have any impact?

In large time/size frames, it's nothing to worry about especially in highly liquid markets such as forex.  
  
But in smaller timeframes / size frames, yes, it can have an impact and degrade the strategy's edge if enough number of people copy your trades.

That argument evolved way back chief, if you were really concerned, for lack of a better word, you would be discussing High frequency trading robots and algorithms and their effect on trading conditions and retail traders lol  
Anyway thats besides the point, why does it bother you so much that someone decided to start a thread and get input in fine tuning a strategy? Heres an idea, since you joined to comment why dont you take it a step further and start your own thread and stop trolling. Pretty sure you will get many subscribers lol

The only problem I have is the arrows appear late after the Semefor indicator has reached it's final setting, causing us to enter 10 to 15 pips late. Testing today for first time.

Hi rcbarlow,  
  
I always enter when the semafor appears and it´s close to the upper or lower band.   
Do you only look at the arrows? Do they repaint?

Thank you  Valdecchio for the system, I just taking some observations, but waiting for your update anyway, charts on the left with marked pink lines are my targets levels -herd mentality that I marked on H1 and H4, I did not stay with my pc all day and I just starting with you're system so did not follow macd .... Anyway, maybe if one includes targets before trading, it can improve the system, I will continue observation with this approach...

The supply and demand balance will change, price will adjust to this change and start moving in a different pattern and OP's strategy will progressively lose its effectiveness as more and more people copy...

But you do realise that by making his strategy public, OP has engaged a wider audience who are now testing his strategy, giving their feedback, sharing their own indicators, suggesting changes and contributing in improvement of the system. As someone rightly pointed out here, our financial contribution to international foreign exchange market would be a pubic hair in an ocean.  
  
By your logic, even breathing oxygen is a zero-sum game but I wouldn't imagine you going around killing the competition. Because if it is available in abundance, it really isn't a problem.

Dear ...  
I understand your concern, but you can't, and you don't have to worry about anything.  
one of the first things I learned about FOREX, and which people who live in forex taught me, is that the market movements generate them the "sharks" of the big world stock exchanges, wall street etc .. and we are talking about thousands of traders who invest trillions of dollars.  
here we are talking about a stupid, and elementary system for children, to make us ordinary mortals, who do not dress in jackets and ties in front of the monitor, a modest monthly salary, this system should have a yield (in money, not in pips) about $ 80-100 a day, 500 a week, 2,000 a month (ABOUT). it is not over .. to reset the trends of all markets ... at least 5 billion people are needed, with small investments for a profit of $ 2000 per month.  
I share it, and I don't sell, I don't keep something secret that many could make a change, there are countries that even with $ 300 can live for 3 months.  
now I will discover the cards on the table ... I am a soldier of the Italian army, I am seeing how much human misery there is for the world, how petty the human being is, murderer, thief, and much more, I think the only one animal in this land that must become extinct, be the human being. I don't want to stoop to being selfish, and think only of myself, I see so much misery in the world that I find unfair ...  
that said ... don't worry!  
I certainly won't be me and a dozen users here on forexfactory to destabilize the markets.  
but now, let's not go back to this discussion and think about improving this system.

Guys,  
unfortunately the news, which I had posted, did not turn out to be a turning point ...  
but as I have always said .. I do not lay down my arms .. and I go on still looking ... looking ... and looking without stopping, indicators (possibly not repaint), trying combinations of indicators and settings ...  
Guys, however, give me a hand too ... unfortunately I don't have much time for forex and I can't always follow this system .. insert your ideas .. your logics, indicators, settings etc.  
don't let me do it all!![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f602.png?v=15.1)  
for example this week I managed to trade only 2 days ... using the old version ..  
I had to eliminate the bands from the charts, because I got tired of always finding the crashed VPS ..  
for now I'm going to test in this way, I repeat .. propose indicators and ideas to bring this system to the crucial and definitive point.

So Valdecchio, don't you use the MACD indicator anymore? as it's included in the fyle .rar of the first post of the tread?  
do you prefer the SPEARMAN indicator instead? and why your option?  
i try to use your sistem in a pc with 16 pairs , but when the market moves fast my pc is terrible slow... any ideas to make my pc better? what indicator have i to remove? the SUPPORT AND RESISTANCE? thanks

I have 3 graphics open, but everything is slow, which indicator makes the pc slow down so much?  
  
edit: it was the gold chart  
  
However the GBP / USD cross is excellent.

This is today's D30 chart, I find it very positive to enter when the RSI indicator is in the 70/30 values and there is the change of color on the renko candle, I attach the image to make my thoughts better.

Looks good, but watch out in trending markets.

Hi, the half trend indicator is the problem... the unique form to improve it, is limiting the history data...  

  
Max bars in History,  
Max bars in Chart,  
  
Good Look!

Hello,  
Excellent work, I haven't yet seen the set in progress having installed it on Friday night, but a tip for the Quick_Trailing (.set?) because I wonder what would be the average SL and evolution_renko_ea, should it be set up?  
Thanx a lot !

Hello my friends,  
I hope everyone is doing well and everyone is enjoying their weekend.  
I tested this strategy and I must say that I tested hundreds of them without suckers unlike this one where several trades are winning. I opened a demo account on Tuesday June 9 and until Friday I spent 40 trades including 30 trades gaganant which is rather rather very well I find with a leverage at 1: 200 I am therefore lost only 10 trades . share against I am in negatives and not in profit despite having won 30 trades. esque it is me who mismanages my bankrool? esque it is me who makes bad analysis? Are I putting my stop loss much too high unlike take profit which may be too low? I am still a beginner I have some little experience in forex trading but I am still far from your level despite that I discovered tranding about 5 years ago. I would like to know one thing how is it that we could do to take the highest possible profit? I explain that every order I place is broken I put a take profit at 50 pips and a stop loss at 125 pips except that I noticed that when my order closes sometimes the price continues to go up, so suddenly I lose in profit because I earn about 20 € when I could have won maybe 80 €. So I would like to know that it is possible, for example, to create a first take profit at 50pips if the price goes up creates a second take profit at 250pips for example and if the price drops that it ends my order at 50 pips? to be already a little more often with larger profits and slightly smaller losses.  
I am sorry for my English because I am Portuguese resident in France now so I use google translation to write to you.  
while waiting for a rest from your I wish you an excellent day to all of you.

Made some changes to the Valdecchio model, for now the system is doing very well in fact:  
  
\- eliminated the indicator below, including RSI.  
\- new TMA indicator with optimized alerts and parameters.  
\- all the rest is Renko default of Valdecchio.  
  
Thanks Valdecchio you opened my eyes.

Hi Valdecchio... I´ve one question for you!  
You say that all days you find oportunities for operate, but what market do you operate?...  
  
New York  
Londres   
Asia  
  
or that isn´t important for your system?...  
  
I use a Renko Channel, Renko Trend and Stocastic for confirmation!  
  
Thanks for share!

This looks like a really cool system with a lot of potential. It’s just not ideal with Renko bricks not having a set time frame, so I end up missing half the trades. I’m going to be coding a Renko divergence EA over the next couple of weeks and can share it with you guys if you’re interested.

Hey guys,  
  
My strategy is based on one candle movement. I was wondering if somebody could help me to program a tool to help a estimate a probability of an apperance of one candle. For example buy-sell-buy or sell-buy-sell.  
  
Cheers!

Ok, the Half Trend NRP Mladen, did not give entry and the price fell a little more ...  
  
I think the entry will take place during the Asian session ...

I don't understand how this system is profitable when semafor sun is redrawing ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) looking at history everything seems ok, but on live chart you can open sell and after 1 minute semafor flower goes up by 5 renko bars. Maybe I don't understand smth. By the way how to use "quick trailing EA" - there was no explanation

how to follow these rules when entrance is dynamic ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) Imagine price touched top channel and semafor appeared, MACD is downside. According to your rules its time to enter short position, but in a few moments when trade is open price with semafor goes 20 pips up. In history everything will be ok, but in reality its not very ok.   
  
By the way how you calculate RENKO, exact pips or ATR ?

it's all reported in the screeshots in the archive file ..  
  
  
I know that the price does what it wants .. it is always like this .. but it is a strategy that must be tested for the long term .. you do not have to stop at the first loss that happens to you.

But one day you will understand that in forex majority must loose. So whatever strategy you create will not work 100%.

I tried the system also, but it gives me minimum value, because of repaint. And sometimes it even repaints 3 - 4 time (new hights/lows) before price turns.

no ! the semafor indicator must appear! double check that you have entered all the listed!  
I advise you to double check the rules too, because the trade you have opened is wrong!

Remove .mq4 from your indicator folder, leave only the .ex4 . Close the platform and load again.

@igorbraun there is a mess with directory naming in zip. Open Expert tab and you will see errors, Metatrade can not find files. Fix the errors and you will see semafors.  
  
But dont forget that this screen repaints so not very helpfull

Very interesting thread, when volatility is high everything freezes on my MT4 platform and I miss entries, any idea what to do to improve that?

> Want to "improve" your renko strategy?? Easy.. Read RENKO and what its telling you; as soon as you do that you can remove ALL indicators right away (they become useless/redundant) maybe just a momentum oscillator to backup what you are watching on the price Dont put your faith in "indicators" to tell you when to enter/exit a trade.. its dumb, noob and will get you no where After all you can not get any more accurate that reading price in itself and RENKO its stupid accurate once you know how to do it Good luck

My work ends here ... I continued to work and improve this system, I would have published the latest update here, but I won't do it ... I found my system around for sale on the web! this means that it is useless to do charity with a profitable system for the good of all! there is always some child of B. who cannot make money in trading and tries to make money by selling other people's systems (hours and hours of work) of others. for this reason I stop here. I will not post any other updates and you will no longer find me in this thread.  
I don't close it, I leave it to you freely, modify it, add indicators, do it yourself. From now on I will keep it all to myself!  
Congratulations to those who put this system up for sale!  
know it ... what you are selling or giving away for free is not a complete and finished system!  
best wishes ... crafty!

I found that post you referenced on telegram. No one tried to sell it. They just published all the files in an rar archive and gave you full credit.  
  
With respect, I think you owe everyone who spent time here an explanation of what it is you're really up to.

Hi Valdecchio, we deeply understand your feeling.  
It is sad to see the shit-people who steal your work for free and selling it online for money. It is shame on the guy and families of him/her!!  
  
By the way, I downloaded the .rar file and my Semafor indicator always unable to be attached to chart. No working. Only Semafor not working.  
  
Please see image below, anyone who is willing to give me some advice?  
  
The semafor indicator have a little grey dot and it means it is not working. Can someone tell me why?

Hi Valdecchio,  
Is there any way to change the renko size box... 50 pips is to small for me, because my broker average spread is about 28 pips... thanks

28 pips???? or points?. I would have dump that broker centuries ago, why will i have to pay such huge amount.  
OK, that said, when you load your evolution ea, go to the input option and change the size.

Sorry my bad, I mean 28 point that is for EURUSD pair, for other pair it can reach 48 and more and it is not fix spread so the spread can go higher.. I have figure it out the way to change the box size, but thanks for your explanation...

I started in December in assembling a good strategy, putting together some indicators, being very careful not to overdo it in filling the chart, and to date I can say that I have found an excellent system capable of bringing home, from 200 to 500 pips per week, following 3 simple rules. I am also seriously thinking about using this new system as a second job. but there are some angles...

The sell is at the close of the bar where the half trend indicator changed color also with the arrow below that last top semafor.

Well - I have read the whole tread now. To me it looks like it ended like so many other threads: The guy who started the thread have been using a lot of people to help him refine the strategy and at some point he had enough to make a good strategy and then he close the work keeping it all to him self. It happens very often. He is a cheater!

Could you share the link with us, so that we can see ourself what it is about??  
  
And - Valdecchio did not link to anything himself - just made a shout and then stopped everything.  
  
We must know the truth!

Another possibility: He finally found out what so many traders tried to tell him all the way - your repainting setup does not work!! And he was to shamefull to admit it.  
  
Has anybody of the guys following this tread taken this system into a live account and is it running to this date without blowing the account??

OK, I found the link myself: [https://metogram.com/channel/freeindecators.](https://metogram.com/channel/freeindecators)  
  
This is a WEB site that vacuums indicators from everywhere. THEY DO NOT SELL ANYTHING. It is all free stuff. So - nobody earn money on the work done here!!  
  
Now - what are valdecchio using in this trade. Free stuff!!!! He did not made it himself. He is using other peoples work, so why can't other people use his publiced work??  
  
AND valdecchio is using decompilated code ( = Stolen code ). Not saying that he stole the code himself, but he was warned about it in another thread he started before this one, and he was warned early in this thread, so he is aware that he uses stolen code. Well - who is the thief here?? I can link to the warnings about stolen code if it is needed.  
  
No, I think that valdecchio found out that the whole thread was a fantazy and he needed an excuse to get out without having to admit it. Alternatively he cheated all the contributers and kept the results for himself!  
  
So this thread ended as so many others. The initiator suddently disappeared for whatever reason. I have used all day to read through the whole thread and when ending like this I could kick my own ass. I should have known.  
  
  
Today he is asking programmers to make codes for him in other threads.

Maharg. You wrote in May that this system is good and you were quite active about it. We never heard anything from you since.Have you abanded it? Or are you using it today?? What do you think about the system now?  
  
Just trying to find out if anybody at all feel it is a good system and maybe even are using it?? Was it a waste of time or should we continue the work?

> Hey everyone. The system is great and have been working on an almost identical setup. Concept is basically the same. Firstly l use MathTrader7 renko chart creator which has been very stable so far available in FF. l also use TMA+CG by Mladen which does not repaint. My main contribution would be in the area of filtering, basically l use Trendflex indicator for that which can be a great filter. l use the Oracle indicator just for a visual cross, was using a non repaint Semafor before and it gave late confirmation and the repainting ones are honestly...

Hey, I am kind of new to Renko. Could you teach me a thing or two about it? Possible ways to trade it, how to read it and etc.. Would really appreciate it. Thank you.

hello .. excellent system, from a first analysis also very profitable ... I have two questions ... the first I hope that the system does not do repainting and the second is which alarms do you recommend to activate? I don't think there's an alarm for the phone ... thanks for the answer.

This is so stupid. It is repainting in a manor that does it unfeasible for any kind of trading. See the attached pictures. At the first one the closed bar is near the upper band. At the second one - ithe same bar is marked by an arrow - it is very far from the upper band and historically you see no trade - AND THERE WERE NO TRADE.  
  
So to all people viewing this thread: Do not trust what you see at the charts uploaded. The repainting assure that the picture is different later on. You will get so many losses that you have never had before.  
  
This is the indicator TMA Band Double Mod.

Jep. I have seen that many times. Some guy start a thread. Get a lot of inputs and run away with the final system that works. It's a classic.
