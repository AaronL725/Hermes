Hi  
  
I want to share my Futures trading system with you,Ive had so much help from this BB I thought it about time I shared some thing of mine.I trade EOD on Forex and have posted the results under the ‘trading journal’   
  
I have been day trading US Futures for 5 years and thought Id migrate over to the big boys  
  
This system works very well on Futures mainly Russell 2000 I personally use it on 1min time frame. Please make note though this is not a system that only takes 2 trades a day ,this is a scalping system designed to rack up the points. When I trade it with ER2 I stop for the day at +$500 per contract traded.  
  
On Forex it could be 20 –30 pips its up to you…but the aim is to consistently make money not sit in front of a PC all day.  
  
I’m not sure how well it will lend itself to Forex but I think for a start it has to be used on a 5min time frame.  
  
It can give as many as 30 signals a day for the whole session, the main advantage of this is……….. if you work shifts or odd hours you know you can still make some profit as signals will still be triggering. No need to upset the wife and let the tea go cold any more !  
  
The system is simple to trade although on er2 I trade with a 1 tick spread with 3 pips on Forex I will have to adjust. I’m hoping by trading it I can make any changes needed along the way.  
  
I will include my template at the end of this and the Keltner indictor but it essentially uses 2 indicators and I use it on £$  
  
The system is simple on the eye and uses 1 time frame  
  
**Keltner bands**  
  
  
Length 10  
Times ATR 1  
  
**Stochastic**  
  
  
15.3.2Use signal line only ..Colour main line to ‘none’  
15.3.3Set line at 80 and 20  
  
**Long signal**  
  
  
Price closes below the bottom K line Stochastic below 20   
Go long on the next up bar as long as stochastic still below 20   
  
**Exit**  
  
  
Move stop to break even if price touches middle K line (white)  
Take profit if price touches top band line, again it flexible and up to you  
  
**Stops**  
  
  
Up to you… if going long it can be the low of the entry candle  
Or any number of pips you prefer.  
  
Visa versa for shorts.  
  
Here is a screen shot of today up to time of posting on £$ 5min  
  
In my Futures trading platform it is fully coded and traded through Interactive Brokers TWS via Ninja Trader .It could be traded through an EA but I cant code so for me its manual atm.  
  
I don’t mind changing or adapting the system .To me if you don’t adapt or change with the markets you Die.

Interesting system. I trade a variable of the same. Trade only Eur/Usd on the 5m tf. Utilize Stochastic set at 5-3-3, ADX set at 4, a 2sma and 5 sma with a weighted close. Trade from 5 - 11 a.m. pst and average about 10 trades per session with good results (90%). Look to take three (3) pips of net profit and trade 8 contracts per trade. Has been very consistant and profitable for the past eight months. Currently indure a 2 pip spread and have had very little difficulty. Can obtain confirmation by dropping down to 1m tf to time entry and exit. Never trade during "red" news announcements. Thanks for sharing. Keith

Without wanting to hijack the thread - Keith, could you elaborate on the above.   
  
\+ what do you do on those 10% of trades that don't work out? do you have a fixed stop?

Sure. I utilize a 6 pip MENTAL stop loss with my broker. For example, if I initiate a buy order at 1.5000, my stop loss is at 1.4996. (Buy at 1.5000 + 2 pip spread = 1.5002 buy point. Subtract 6 pip stop loss + 1.4996. Opposite is true of sell order. Sell at 1.5000 + 2 pip spread = sell order at 1.4998. Subtract 6 pip stop loss will be set at 1.5004. Hope that makes sense. Can review a perfect sell of Eur/ Usd recently at just five minutes ago on any chart on the 5m tf.

Trading 8 contracts with this system give me a risl to reward of about 1-2, which I have found to be pretty tolerable in forex trading. Am looking to achieve $240.00 per trade while risking $480.00 to do so. Obviously, at a 90% success rate this has provided a decent income from 7-10 trades daily. Appreciate all thought and critiques of my method, am never in a trade very long though. Always have my finger on the close the position trigger and NEVER walk away from the screen while in a trade. Six hours per day is not such a grind compared to many, many less rewarding careers. It is my opinion that you simply must be willing to do Some time at work in order to get paid.

Hi all. Like this strategy/s. So expat r u really full time forex with this? A lot of ppl wouldnt like the risk-reward ration u have but if it works it works eh? Do you ever get caught out with a big move against your favor? i no somtimes price can jump easily above your stop loss and take profit? interested to no more on this.  
Also Paulus would your strategy not work on say 15m timeframe? less trades but it looks like you get more pips and better signals?

Negative. Have never been caught in a whirlwind move against me. Never trade within 15 min. before or 30 min. after hot news releases and this pair moved at a slow enough pace to simulate complete control. With regard to higher time frames, I would imagine there are many variations in which to seek more pips, however, as you said, this system has been very kind to me and I have not tried to fix that which does not seem to be broken. Am interested in any other input you may have and appreciate your concerns, ideas and input.

Sorry for the delay in answering your question. Yes, I am a full time trader. Have actively participated in this battle arena for about a year or so now. Normally throw a couple of meager opinions out on the Eur/Usd forum every now and then. Lots of capable individuals out there with a wide array of trading styles, opinions and general guesses (at times). It is really enjoyable to read the banter between Americans and Brits at times as it is my opinion that many of them lose their perspective in bull or bear runs in this currency pair. I simply do not have the inclination to try to trade the news at all and am not patient enough to trade of the higher tf's than the 5 and 1m exclusively as I am obviously a scalper by nature. I do however respect and thoughtfully consider ALL individual styles as we all are simply seeking to take just a little bite of this enormous pie at regular feeding intervals. Thanks for chiming in and hope you stick around a while as your input in both appreciated and thought provoking.

here the 15min chart..the sigs look good although one of the reasons for this type of system is so that you can come to the PC in an hours window and grab some points.  
  
If you want to sit and watch for the bigger moves then the 15min is the way to go..  
  
BTW on futures I bring the stop to break even when we hit the middle ma line also if I have a signal that close on or within a couple pips of the line its regarded as a none signal...   
  
Ive had $500 per contract on er2 many a time and stayed on to trade the whole session only to close up $700 per contract or up $200 per contract.. I try to get the average..if volatilty picks up and the $500 is getting easily hit time and time again quickly with good moves and signal then I increase the daily tgt  
  
I should say that on Futures I trade in pairs of contract close one at +2 ( $200) and the other at +3 ( $300) when i re read my post it says per contract.  
  
If after several trades im sitting at +4 for example and i get a signal i close both at 1/2 point profit and walk with 1 full point as its made my 5  
  
heres the 15min chart

Sorry folks, will try to answer as best I can. Will also check on starting a thread as I have never broached that possibility. As stated earlier, I trade daily so will work on this thread thing this afternoon. Entry signals are pretty straight forward. 2 sma should be approching or crossing 5 sma, stochastics rising above or below the 20 / 80 settings normal to this indicator and ADX should also be converging or crossing. I go with the current candle on the 5m tf and also have the 1m tf chart on the screen in order to confirm direction. The 1m chart will normally show the move 2 - 3 minutes ahead of the 5m chart. I will also try to learn about posting to actual screen shots of varios trades as this thread progresses and I figure out how to do so. It is, however, very easy to set up the indicators and back test this system at your convienence. I fully realixe that the indicators in use are lagging in nature, however, ALL indicators are lagging aren't they. You simply must be able to develope a feel for the pair you have chosen and this particular pair moves with decent volatility and yet does not move too violently. Hope this helps. Lastly, you can also trade the 1m tf with these same indicators, however, the results will be many more trades with around 70% winners. It seems, at least to me, that staying around 90% (5m tf) is good enough for the time being. I am very adaptable though and not adverse to ideas that can enhance results.

Tha last trade went for +11 as the bands tighten so the signals try up which is a good filter as I see it for those whip saw periods..  
  
A short is setting up now and will wait for a red candle or doji to enter..

I take it you trade this same currency pair predominantly? Has your method proved effective with any other pairs? Thx.

I like your aproach Paulus. i like the way price goes back to the channel when outside of it. I guess it could be good trading it from 20:00 gmt where market is in sleep mode and price like to oscillate on 1 level.

hi, i noticed that on your charts you are posting that your put your arrows which mean buy on the first up bar (for long) does this mean you are not waiting for close?  
  
thanks.  
  
this is A+ system, i am going to have to quit my dayjob. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)  
  
also, are you taking into account this when you post the charts with the pips you made?

Hi Paulus. I took the liberty of starting a scalping thread on the Eur/Usd a few minutes ago. Perhaps you would be interested in going to that thread and submitting your system as an alternative or variation as we seem to have the same basic trading manner. Just a thought. Great trading to you. Keith

Jup that's what I figured out to. Adding Multi Time Lines really helps. You see that it's quite dangerous to trade the London Open. If you look at the quite times you'll have more trade fades.

Hi Expat  
  
no not really .. bit green when it comes to Forex day trading I cut my teeth in the futures markets.  
  
This system was taking 40 points a day on er2 when we had high volatility...thats $4000 per contract per day.With Forex I can trade doz of swaps or should I say i have the choice to.. with futures you look at   
  
Es,Er2 Ym and Nas and they will all generally be the same, they all rally at the same time and bottom at the same time etc etc..if Es is waiting to break Hod the others will wait with it !.

Paulus,  
  
Thanks a bunch for sharing this system.  
  
At first galnce it looks like a really fantastic yet simple system.  
  
Would you mind in giving approx stats for you futures trades.  
  
What was your average hit rate?  
What was your Reward/risk ratio?  
  
Thanks in advance and thank you for sharing.

Greenhaze thanks for your advice I can see that makes sense these comments are worth there wait in Gold.. I will keep a check of the signals and see what happens  
  
Nikolaou I enter the same as I was in my futures trading ..I take the trade in the last 10secs of the signal bar.I have a 5min timer so I can easily keep a check of timings.If I see a signal I like to know if I have 25secs or 4mins 59secs lol  
  
Cheers

Did a bit of futures trading a decade or so ago. Had to phone in all order to a broker and was not as astute as I should have been. Getting charts in the mail was no picnic either. Forced to concentrate on seasonal grains and an occassional metals gamble. Am much more comfortable in this arena.

bazuk  
  
here is one of my Futures trading charts its on a site called chart hub..my future trading platform is IRT by linnsoft and chart hub is the way we can post to let others see our chart  
  
<http://www.charthub.com/images/2008/03/14/K_chart_3>  
  
and later in the day  
  
<http://www.charthub.com/images/2008/03/14/K_chart_13>  
  
and another on this day I stopped at +5 ( $500 per contract) but the system was on 17.1 ( $1,710 per contract)  
  
<http://www.charthub.com/images/2008/04/17/System_1_5>  
  
  
  
If you go to chart hub and look for more charts from this user you will se all my charts and exploits in ER2 trading..the +39 refers to 39 points x $100 per contract so $3,900 per contract.  
  
The strike rate wasn't particularly high on winners because as you can see I cut my losers out fast..hence the 0+0 but all done in a mechanical way..I don't do emotions.the arrows you see are automatically put thier by the software as I coded it.  
  
I later changed the zero zero on both contracts and moved to a diff type of stop which turned some of those break evens into winners.. this made it easier for me to hit my 5 point tgt.  
  
Hope that helps

If you go to the chart hub site and find all my postings please do not think they are all of the same system..over the years I have traded many systems on diff time frames... some of the charts are experimental posted to let other trader friends see what Im up to or talking about.  
  
If its got a K in the title its this my current system

hi paulas  
by signal bar do you mean the doji or red candle, if so do you wait for it to close? because checking back, i see alot of false signals especially in a trending market, the keltner lines follow the price either up or down?

Hi Book times..  
  
The entry candle is where the red arrow is and i enter in the last 10secs of that arrow.by the very nature of the system my trade will always be in the opposite direction to the Keltner.  
  
I do not wait for any thing ..I don't wait for ma's to change colour or stochastic to cross..If the price is out side the channel and the stoch is OB or OS I want in and will do it on the down candle for a short up candle for a long.  
  
You will have losing trades but if their nipped in the bud you'll be ok.  
  
I think like a sparrow I come down to the lawn and take loads of little pieces of bread rather than the loaf like the wood pigeon ..if he drops it he loses the lot and may have to wait a day for another loaf to appear..I just nip down and take another small piece ..lols  
  
sorry it was the best I could think of .... ;-)  
  
  
  
Its mainly counter trend trading but I do get signals if there is a strong pull back in an uptrend for example and the price comes down through the bottom K line then I'm normally long ready for the next rally as the stoch will be over sold ...all i need is an up bar  
  
cheers

I didnt trade these way to early for me here in the UK  
  
Any one going to chart hub via the link would have sen allot of +0 point trades,Ive set up a chart with early morning signals to show you how it is achieved.  
  
Again I'm not sure its workable with forex but I don't see why not and time will tell

Thanks Paulus for shearing your system. I'll be following your trades...   
Can you tell how many signals per day it generates? and you only trade cable?  
  
What do you thing of tp half of your position and the other half at be, just to catch the trend if it happens?

I guess that is just some boxes put there for indication of past trades in cable. NOT A INDICATOR or a signal indicator.  
delete those

Hi  
If you are using IB, the Forex spread on gbpusd i see is 1 to 2 pips. Although there is a commission to pay, so it may be more effective than you think, your system.

What i've always wanted for such systems is 2 hot buttons infront of me which automaticly sell or buy a specific amount of currency at market price.  
I just think i'm to slow when i have to click like a maniac on my MT platform just to open and close a position.

zaka around 20-30 signals a day .. actually I may be switching over to EURUSD as only 2 pips spread.  
  
I was watching 3 swaps but was seriously doing my head in   
  
Yes like the idea of closing half and letting the rest run I do this on my eod forex but found for a couple months i would of made allot more closing the lot at 1st tp...in day trading its finding a reliable way of letting the runners run.

Zaka in your post number 38 you show a losing trade this will happen but....  
  
Are you sure the up bar ( entry bar) was taken with the stoch below 20 it doesn't look like it to me the 2nd winning trade the stoch IS below 20  
  
Could u double check for me

Emacro  
  
Yes tried trading it with IB ..trouble;e is if you use thier TWS as a data feed which I did it only gives you around 8 swaps and its not a smooth process getting it into IRT..  
  
In the end I moved over to MT for my Forex ..Commission is negligible really $2 round trip and ER2 and thats for a contract thats $100 per point so if you close with just 1tick ($10) you easily cover the spread  
  
I did look at Esignal but to be quite honest I really wanted a plateform I could trade through not along side ...my only other option is trade station which is free if you do a certain number of trades a month  
  
cheers

Long position  
  
I enter in the last 10 secs of the entry candle with a nominal 10 pip tp and sl  
When im filled I modify my ticket to take tp at the top kelt band this is easy to do as the navigator window in MT gives you exact keltner price  
  
When I get a new 5min candle ,the keltners have obviously moved up or down and i simply modify the order again.  
  
If I'm in the trade for 20mins I enter once,then modify 3 times... 1 min before the end of each new 5min candle i get the modify ticket up and get ready to change it.  
  
This may seem like alot of hassle but it only happens once every 30mins or so

I was playing with this strategy and guess what...  
  
in the same window change to the hour and put some fibs, change back to 5min and bingo... you have the big points of reverse, just helps some candle sticks knowledge.  
  
What's your thoughts Paulus?

This system should be good in a ranging market, but in a trending market I think it will struggle, perfect example now on e/u, the kelts will follow the price down and beyond your entry bar,

Hi Paulus. Has anyone on your forum experienced problems with their broker while trading a scalping system? Am hearing quite a bit of noise about this potential problem. Thx.

Hi Zaka  
  
I took both of those   
  
Entry on the 1st I got 1.5442 I have a pain threshold of 15 pips and that got hit  
  
On the 2nd I got an entry of 1.5434 and was taken out at 1.5440 for 6 pips  
  
on both a 9 pip loss.. atm I cant see a way round it  
  
To put this in perspective since 9am ( the system was up 28 before that but i started at 9am today)  
  
Ive had 12 trades  
  
+17+11+26-9+16+15-9+11-7+11-15+6 = +73  
  
I enter then been placing stop 1 pip below low of entry bar for a long and 1pip above entry bar for a short..taking tgt in the same way and its been working very well...When i took the trade with the biggish loser I would have had to set a stop of 17 pips ...15 is my threshold.

Where do you plot it on your chart with normal one of MT4? I tried to do that but it does not look like yours?

Your system will probably work best asian session. While Expat's system may work better during European session.

No negative daily value preset as of now. Worst day encountered was at 8 and 3 some weeks ago. Interesting idea about a merger. As you are obviously far more adept at this computer thing than I, what can I do to help expedite such a challenge. Am more than willing to find ways to improve or increase results. I see you had arpond 76 pips for the day. At best I might have 40 -45. Let me know your thoughts.

I think I'm missing your entry. You wait for a close outside the keltner. Do you then enter at the open of the bar following the up or down candle?

How does a Keltner band compare to a Bollinger band? Forgive the ignorance.

Hi Ex  
  
the Bb can expand massively when volatility picks up the keltners tend to stay roughly parallel with price where as the BB can explode all over the place  
  
Unusable for this system as in alot of the case price would never move outside the bands

While I end my own trading day at 18:00 gmt, I lurk around a bit longer. I noticed your trade setup for a short at 1.5449. From my own observations, it seems prudent to check the Usd/Chf pair from the period of 18:00 to 20:00 as it seems to be another pair that works in an inverse direction to that of the Eur/Usd. Just another possible tool to help gage a trade in this pair. Do not mean to intercede, just an observation. A quick glance at the Usd/Chf 5m chart for the last hour or so will perhaps give some insight to my opinion.

Look at asian session historically for EURUSD. [Spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") are usually small, the market is ranging, so over bought/over sold levels are respected higher % of the time than when the market is generally more trendy (which happens during European session and sometimes during US session).

EURUSD fireworks are usually done by 1-2 PM EST, so theoretically, you don't have to wait for the official asian session, just when the markets are more calm.

Paulus,  
  
Great results today.  
  
I do have one query the second long trade that occuured at about 1630 at 1.5470 seemed to hit it's breakeven stop after the next candle hit the middle white line.  
  
Yet I do not seem to see a break even score in your results. Did you use that rule?  
  
Or am I missing something?  
  
Thanks again.

the trade at 16.30 was filled at 1.5472 the stop was placed 1 pip below the low of the entry candle that would be at 1.5461 at no time was it threatened

From 9am to close system finished on 60 ( from open to 9am it gained 28) today I didn't get all that..88 in total I didn't get any where near all that as I didn't take all the signals...  
  
I havnt got a super filter it was just family life and the phone made it impossible.  
  
I still advocate taking 20-30 and running ..  
  
the biggest winner was around 26pips today not bad for a scalping system that throws out 30 odd signals but please be aware the losers have a max of 15 pips but average out around 7-8.  
  
This system will have losers any system will,but this is a mechanical system pure and simple..its easy to work with and easy to identify signals ....once your in you will have to modify your order ticket at the start of a new 5min bar to set the new tp at the K lines move.

I am not sure what that post means (Jeta). Are they asking for a daily accounting of trades placed? Obviously, that would be both inappropriate and rude to even request. Perhaps I am just misunderstanding the request as no competent individual would seriously request a private accounting from another traders account. Anyway, thanks again for the help.

They probably mean on a demo account... not your real money... although some people have posted that too... if its small amount no one cares about the number, all they want to see basically is for how long the system has been succesful, how much % it made, how many win/loss trades, maximum drawdown and so on. Some statistics of the strategy if you like.

Exactly. I think many people following this forum are sick and tired of people claiming their systems work, but after wasting many days of perfecting trading the strategy discover that the founder of the strategy actually loses money.  
  
Just check out all the systems on collective2.com. There is only _ONE_ forex system there that is somewhat profitable with a long track record. Not a good sign huh?  
  
Just look at all the damn threads on FF. There are THOUSANDS of them. After wasting an incredible amount of time, I have discovered that there are no more than 5-6 threads worth anything. The rest of the threads are started by newbies or losers that have come up with something out of a book and look for attention and followers and encouragement on FF.  
  
You have lagging indicators, bad risk/reward, no straight rules, slippage, and big spread all against you and you still claim you can do it? That's crazy! Show results.  
  
Real/Demo whatever, just show proof that it works.

Some statistics of the strategy if you like.

Perhaps this will suffice for now. This is a copy of the April statement sent to my business partners. It at least shows how many trades were initiated and, as mentioned before, results can easily be ascertained by simply backtesting as appropriate. Trade times are M-F 12:00 to 18:00 gmt. Good trading to all.

If someone is giving you something for free, either accept it or move on.  
If they are trying to sell it, you have a point. I would want to see proof. He isn't selling anything.

Only communicated with Paulus recently, however, both systems have some of the same methodology behind them. Paulus posted his results today and they are very impressive. That system seems more countertrend than the one I utilize, but there may be a way to combine the two to achieve some consistant pips. We both were online all day today and tried to help as many as possible understand each of the systems involved. I have been a lurker here for some time and fully understand what many (Jeta) have had to endure as far as outlandish claims. It is unfortunate, however, each of you surely realize that almost every individual out there in forum land is just trying to find a way to fit into this vast speculative arena. As for me, will be at it again in the a.m. (12:00 to 18:00 gmt) trying to beg the Forex gods for some crumbs. All are welcome to attend as I will do my best to keep everyone aware of what I see developing and trading it accordingly. There were some in attendance today that actually demo'd as the day progressed. Paulus seems to offer the same opportunity. Untimately, as was mentioned, I am selling nothing and simply sharing a method that has been effective for both myself and my business partners. Have a great evening and remember "PLAN THE TRADE & TRADE THE PLAN". Good Evening. 

All that is needed for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing !!

Hi Paulas,  
I have just found this thread and have loaded up your template and gone over your rules, but I have a couple of questions, sorry if they are newb in nature ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
I think I understand the entry method, and want to clarify the TP and SL situation. I set the SL just under the LOW of the bar I entered the trade on? If I recall you said you wait until the last 10 seconds of the entry bar to place your order? So you set a nominal 10 pt SL and TP when you enter, then 10 seconds or so later you go back and adjust your SL and TP?  
The TP level you set is at the highest Kelt bar? Over a period of how many bars, or just the point it's at directly above the entry bar?  
Then you adjust your TP on every bar close? If yes then I assume it is indeed at the top Kelt bar above the new bar.  
Once you enter the trade, the SL never changes correct? Or would you recommend running a trailing stop?  
I also noticed on some post you had stated TP of 20-30 pips, which method is testing out better?  
Thanks, and sorry for so many questions, hopefully I won't have too many more once I demo test this for longer.  
I look forward to your results daily.  
Thanks!

Jeta  
  
I think Expat gave you a very gracious reply,without wanting to be banned from this site I would of told you to sling your hook .  
  
As another poster says we give this info free you havnt got to read it or waste your valuable time on it.I for one will not show any of my personal trading accounts.Thats between me and my accountant and no one else.  
  
Ive been trading for 8 years and still learning and reading and asking ..I dare say Ive wasted hundreds of hours looking at bold statements of systems.  
  
I don't know where you were really coming from .. I trade and Im sharing my system Im not in the dock of the old baily ,if your sick and tired don't post or read any more of the threads on the BB.  
  
I lose trades I lose money I have good days and bad I miss trades go in late on trades come out early on trades I make mistakes .. You want a perfect system with full accounting back up ,high win rate low draw down ..  
  
Hmmm it don't exist I think  
  
I say what I think black and white thats me like my systems .. this prob sounds harsh,but hey ho .  
  
Any way its 6.29am and Ive got to go into London with my wife on a hostpital appointment will answer posts when i get back.  
  
Happy hunting and chill ..

For above it is safe to assume that you used 1 pip below or above entry candle for Stop loss?

Hi All,  
  
Thanks for the posts my wife is fine thankyou.  
  
  
Hmmm not a good day by the looks it seems this system is going to need work to be profitable on Forex.This system was lifted over from Futures without any adaptation.  
  
Zaka see what your saying with your 3 entry play perhaps you can keep and eye on it and let me know how it pans out in the next week.Id be very interested as I think this system shows very good merit  
  
Aelimian yes you are correct although i think that will have to be changed.  
  
Pipsforall Expats system has been tried and tested over several months my system although great on Futures for the same period looks like it needs some filters judging by today,from the posts Ive seen Expat seems a calm and very controled inividual and would be a great mentor for any trader to follow and emulate.  
  
thehenryfam it seems i have to change a few things lols ..no back testing at all I traded the system on Futures for several months with very good returns.  
  
Tazman If I go short its in the last 10 secs of the bar I have the stop and tgt set to the approx levels of 1pip above the high of the entry bar and the level of the bottom keltner line.  
  
After im filled I click on modify ticket and adjust the SL and TP to the exact pips at the time of the entry bar ..each candle is 5mins so we have time  
  
then a new 5 min bar starts I leave the stop where it is ( 1 pip above entry bar) but as the bottom K line would of moved I adjust the TP with the modify order again.. Im working on refinments now

Paulas,   
Very glad to hear your wife is fine.  
And thank you for the response. Yep this is exactly how I was testing it during the asian session last night and wasn't doing very well. That's why I wanted to confirm all that. I see you are seeing problems as well so apparently it wasn't just me ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
I sent you a pm a day or so ago. Would u be willing to share your template for ninja trader with me so I can play with this on the ES? I am really curious to see how it compares to the scalping method I am using now.  
  
Let me know, I'd be very appreciative!

I used NT just as a way to execute trades it wasn't coded into the software.  
  
I had coded it into IRt by linnsoft using the data feed supplied by interactvive brokers with thier tws if you have that software I will gladily send you my signal which will run automaticaly and generate the signals both visualy and verbally.  
  
This signal could then be used to automatically trigger an order  
  
cheers

Hey Paulus, you and Taz keep plugging away at that machine. TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL! Can hardly wait for you to work out those few bugs. You will assuredely be rolling then. I need to find someone to code and test for me, I am skepticle that an automated trading possibility can be accomplished with a system such as mine, as it has small TP and Sl targets. Will patiently wait and see though. Good day Sir.

Expat, I think starting with a dashboard of sorts to at least notify you of the conditions being met to enter a trade would be an excellent start. I know that's the problem I have with alot of these. Too many things to stare at non stop til they all fall into place. I noticed in another thread (forget which at the moment) someone came up with a nice dashboard for the method, maybe you can do the same.

Ex, I'm still hoping to get an EA working for your system. I think I overtaxed it last week when I had it looking for M1 confirmations. As a result, it didn't want to take any trades! LOL. Also, I had coded more stringent stochastic requirements than you had intended as I was requiring it to have passed over the 20 or 80 line on one of the two previous bars to be a valid entry. Will try again on Monday and see how it goes.

Hi Taz, I can barely handle navigation of my auto dashboard, much less the idea put forth by you. I am willing to do whatever it takes to help folks, will just need tome time to figure all the mechanics out. Will let you concentrate on my man Paulus for a while as to keep focus and concentrate efforts. Thx.

Sorry that it came across that way expat! Was not my intention to request a dashboard from you or in any way portray that it was something you needed to do. So please dont feel that way. It was strictly in response to your post: "I need to find someone to code and test for me, I am skepticle that an automated trading possibility can be accomplished with a system such as mine, as it has small TP and Sl targets. Will patiently wait and see though. Good day Sir." It was just my attempt at a suggestion that instead of trying to get a complete EA coded (which it sounded like you wanted to start on with someone) that maybe a dashboard situation would be an easier goal for now. Sorry if I wasn't clear and came across the wrong way. I definitely don't want to be 'killing you' ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Henryfam  
  
Time is not an issue here the markets will always be there,as i found in futures time spent now at this stage will pay dividends when trading,and with proper money management building an account to a very respectable size wont take long.  
  
I feel totally helpless not being able to code in MT in my old platform I could code a complicated system in 2-3 hours.Any help you can give at all will be very well received.  
  
As I stated in my 1st post the Keltner system is there to be pushed and pulled about so please do what you think is required .None of what we do is solely our own idea some where along the line other traders have done the same at some time.  
  
And im 100% certain that many traders have dropped potentially very profitable system just because of a bad day  
  
Like the amoeba the system has to change to suit its surrounds.  
  
Thanks for your help

Interesting material (blogs) Paulus. I am curious as to how such a techique would be beneficial to a 5m plan such as mine. Perhaps, upon review of my charts, I could initiate trade with 2 positions. Close one at TP (3 net pips), and close the other at generation of an opposite signal. Natuarally, all position would be closed at SL. Is this a thought with any merit in your esteemed opinion? X

Hi Ex  
  
Initially on Futures I wanted to lock in $500 per contract and on the volatility at the time it seemed feasible.  
  
By using 2 contracts I increased my chances of doing it by closing 1 contract for +2 bringing the stop to break even on the 2nd..  
  
One more point of movement gave me +3 on my 2nd and $500 for the pair of contracts.  
  
The stop was set to 1point on each contract so a losing signal gave me -2 while a winning signal gave me +5 a nice risk return.  
  
With the volatility on Futures dropping I adjusted my targets to +1 and +2 giving me $300 for a successful signal against -$200 for a losing signal RR still positive so was happy  
  
As an example If I had the following +1+0,+1+2 ........after 2 trades Im sitting on +4 ( $400) when i take my 3rd trade because Im trading 2 contracts I would close when im 5 ticks in profit ( $50 per contract) this gives me 1 full point and 5 points for the day.  
  
I wouldn't wait for the normal 1 and 2 point targets to be hit.  
  
Money management would require you to go from 2 to 4 to 6 to 8 etc with each pair being trade giving you $500  
  
I think this approach has merit if it would work for you I couldn't tell.  
  
This is one advantage of having an EA for your system you could easily prog the stop scenario in and take at look at how it compares to your existing set up  
  
Hope that helps  
  
cheers

It seems plausible to attempt some manner of this style. I could open a 2 contract trade, close one a TP1 and let the other go for another potential 4-5 pips as it would be a "free money trade". Will look into an ea also, but very difficult with my particualr system. Doing some trading on Monday or what ?

Taz  
  
taking your suggestion of entering on the following bar but on a lmt order,my concern was that the really good signals just go and you would miss the entry.  
  
However on the signals above taking a lmt order with a view of covering the 2 pip spread   
  
ie if going long at 12 ( close of bar 10) then enter a lmt buy at 10..you gain 2 pips on every winner and save 2 pips on every loser ( with a fixed stop)  
  
On the trades above you would have +9-5 ( next signal didn't retrace so no +5) +6+14 =+24points  
  
I will look at this today  
  
cheers

ok fix doing well so far  
  
Taking the lmt buy/sell although its a bit tricky and an EA just to do the ltd buy/sell would be easier i think  
  
+9-5+6+14-5-5+9+8+11= +42

Paulus,  
  
Did you change your stoch settings? I noticed on your chart that it shows (5,3,2) but in your previous posting the settings were (15,3,2) Which one are correct?

Hi FX  
  
I wasn't actually using the stoch to trigger the trades in the 1st lot of posts..I was using the stoch purely to show an OB or OS situation once I had that I was going short on the next down or up candle candle which worked extremely well on futures and got me in sooner as I wasnt waiting for the stoch to turn.  
  
This fix involves using the stoch in a more conventional manner and it needs to be quick hence the setting of 532 Im using it now to instigate the trade once outside of the top or bottom K line.  
  
This is obviously the standard way to use a stochastic but im not using main line going through signal to trigger ..will post at the end of the day if it seems to be working well.  
  
System on 42 I think a good cut off point for the day is 30 pip which is equal to my +2+1 = +$300 per contract on Futures  
  
cheers  
  
Paulus

Paulus,  
Trying to understand your tweak. What price are you basing the limit entry on? I know you said the previous bar, but the high? low? close?  
I am glad this new fix is promising so far, obviously more testing required to see if it was the tweak, or just a good market today ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

ok so the **signal** bar which is just the bar that closes under the low k line, as well as under 20 stoch. So this is the close price you are taking 2 pips off, not waiting for the next **up** bar to close and taking 2 pips off that one?  
Just making sure I understand how you are doing it so I can change my test mode today and see how it fairs.

new fix kept me out of the 2 losing signals in the down trend but also kept me out of the winner at the bottom..The losers would of cost me 5 pips a piece the winner was 10pips so no gain or loss over all

Paulus,  
No apologies necessary, as I am sure it's not you confusing me, just that I get confused ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
For clarification, the way I look at your system is that we have a signal bar, and an entry bar. I think that's how I laid it out for myself. The signal bar is the one that closes under the bottom kelt, and under 20 stoch.  
The entry bar is the bar we wait until the last 10 seconds to see if it's an UP bar, then enter our trade right before it closes.  
With that in mind, since you said the bar you normally enter on, I assume you mean the entry bar, so you are letting it close completely, then taking 2 pips off it's close price and placing your trade at that limit.  
Hopefully this time I will understand it ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1) (and again, not your fault)

Great to see your having success...  
Could you maybe post some of your trades/charts for us to see what trades you took on the 1hr and 4hr timeframes?  
  
Some more info would be great. Also what settings are you using for the stochs?  
  
Thanks ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

I must have missed it somewhere, but looks like you changed the stoch to 5/3/2 from 15/3/2?

you got it taz ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
BenQ yes Im instigating a fix I need to get this great futures system working on this forex beast ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f621.png?v=15.1)  
  
from post 137  
  
I wasn't actually using the stoch to trigger the trades in the 1st lot of posts..I was using the stoch purely to show an OB or OS situation once I had that I was going short on the next down or up candle candle which worked extremely well on futures and got me in sooner as I wasnt waiting for the stoch to turn.  
  
This fix involves using the stoch in a more conventional manner and it needs to be quick hence the setting of 532 Im using it now to instigate the trade once outside of the top or bottom K line.  
  
This is obviously the standard way to use a stochastic but im not using main line going through signal to trigger ..will post at the end of the day if it seems to be working well.

Good day to all. Paulus, "ICFX" asks if my system may be effective in trading the Euro in the futures arena. Sent a reply to inquire with you as your experience far exceeds that of my own. What are your thoughts on this? Are the R/R setups to tight for futures? Is this even possibly? Thx. Btw, congrats! Looks like you have made an excellent adjustment and are rolling. Not so good for me today at 6-2. Might be frustrating a few who are visiting my thread. Such is life. 

All that is needed for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing !!

Hi Pippy  
  
Can i post a chart tonight just as a conclusion of things with the new entry criteria ?  
  
All what was happening was that taz suggested that rather than enter the market when you get a signal it may be a good idea to set a lmt order for the next bar as he noticed most signals retraced a few pips.  
  
So if my normal entry candle for a long finishes at 12 then set a lmt order for 10 on the next bar If price comes down to 10 we are filled for the long and 2 pips better off.Its a bit tricky to do you just had to be in the zone lols when the 5min entry bar finishes.  
  
The system I posted charts for on Friday used the stochastic just to show over bought over sold areas..if the stochastic went over sold ie below 20 then I would go long on the next up bar and would not look at what the stoch was doing..this is aggressive trading and gets you in sooner on the move and worked very well on US futures..  
  
Today I am looking at what the stoch is doing once we are outside the upper or lower K line and its in over bought or over sold area.  
  
I wont post now as I don't want to waste people time as it may not work long term ..   
  
But will post a chart tonight with how I'm looking at the stoch I hope you don't mind

Pippy, Best to wait til the end of the day when Paulus sums up the changes he's made. It's changing in progress right now so it's not something we should jump all over just yet, let's give him some time to go over the results. JMO

Expat  
  
I used to trade Russell 2000 futures Er2 ..  
  
1 tick = $10  
1 full point $100  
  
Along with Dow Jones Futures,Dax Futures, and a little of the German Bund Future  
  
bid ask spread on Er2 was 1 tick so very tight and good to trade not sure about Euro Futures..from what I can see you need a future with a tight spread.

This is a great thread, and great postings!  
  
Question: When a SIGNAL bar closes below the lower Keltner band and also below the Stochastics 20 line, does the _very next bar_ have to be the ENTRY bar? In otherwords, can there be an intervening bar, or must the two bars be consecutive?

ok still at suck it and see stage but looks promising your the experts any 'try this advice' will be wellcome the more the merier  
  
Im still using 20 and 80 for over bought over sold  
  
On my chart you will see   
  
Main line - white  
Signal line Red  
  
What i want to see for a long is   
  
Main line ticking up on the bar that is up  
the signal line must be going up as well but it need not have been below the OB or OS lines all i want is joint confirmation of UP or DOWN  
  
For a long If the main line is going up and the signal line is not it tells me we could be moving down more  
  
Ive labeled the signals to make it a bit easier  
  
A - uptick on main but signal down still and down bar - no sig  
B - Uptick on main down still on signal ( close but checked in navigator) - no sig  
c - up tick on both with up bar - sig - +7 pips + 9pips on lmt buy   
D - Down tick on main but signal up still - no sig  
E - Down tick on both with down bar - sig +6 pips +8 with lmt sell  
F - Up tick on main but signal down - no sig  
  
These are just a few examples were all in this game together so if you see a better solution just post it here,if you think something other than a stoch will work let me know  
  
im happy with this and will check on it throughout the week ..  
  
Ok got me tin hat on for incoming but 'waking the deads on tonight' and im a fan so be patient with me

do you also look at 1m? sometimes i just dont see how in live-mode you'd know that the stoch is crossing and not gonna cross back. like, and the open of bar C wouldnt have the white stoch been pointing down, so by the time it actually crosses the price has already moved. i'm just wondering lol

Hi "P", ever take care of that line problem. Building quite abit of support here I see. I still am reviewing charts to see possibilities of combining systems as you generate ample trades, and profitable ones at that. Thought I would throw your thread out to the Trading Room (post #140 on my thread) attendees tomorrow, but would like permission before initiating such an action. How did things go for you today. I see you were lurking around as I huffed and puffed to get that last trade in today. That was a beast indeed. Talk to you soon. Highest Regards, X

Raver find the 5min min easy peasy lemon squeezy when it comes to judging entry ..I find it very relaxing way to trade and the 5min gives you amble time to check your lines either by eye or with the navigator.  
  
I traded 6months on an 89 tick chart that was fast and furious the 5min is almost like investing to me...lols  
  
You just have to be tuned in when it matters then rest..I like it

Hi Bobcat  
  
Stoch below 20 price comes down through bottom band and closes below bottom band,I then wait for the stoch to up tick with price signal and main lines and i go long  
  
There are instances of stoch up ticking and price giving doji then doji then up bar..the system as yet is not hard and fast and that part of it is up to you.  
  
But for me I need the up tick of stoch and the up bar for the long entry all to happen at once .. By sticking to this approach im trying to reduce signals firing off in the opposite direction when a strong trend develops.  
  
The main line will tick more often than not with price but in strong trend the signal line keep going with the trend and so stops you taking a signal  
  
It doesn't stop them all but it helps..I'm more than willing to change the settings or add another confirmation indicator or another type of filter if some one recommends them  
  
The system is there to be used and abused broken and remade .. with the outcome being a logical well tested system

So as to be clear, can you provide the times that you are trading live. I believe you trade close to the same times I do (12 -18:00 gmt). Thx. X

I added the attached indicator: Center of Gravity ( I got this from another thread in this forum).  
  
If this indicator is added to Paulus strategy, I found that the success rate will be more. The COG indicator too is not fixed It changes position and is a lagging indicator. But this helps.   
  
I take a long trade when the price touches the bottom line of Keltner band, the bottom green line of COG indicator and when the stochaistic is below 20.  
  
For short Vice-versa. I fell that the success rate is more when we add COG indicator.

Hi Paulus,  
  
Thanks for sharing your strategy with us.   
  
I'm trying to follow your most recent instructions per Posts #158 and (Chart) on 159. Would you take a look at my notes to your chart and share your thoughts?   
  
I realize you're giving us examples of both valid and invalid, and not necessarily *all* the trades. These popped out at me as ones I may have taken.  
  
Also, are you still making your decision in the last 10 seconds of the 5 min bar?  
  
Thanks again,  
  
LePip

Simple sorry for the late post..thanks for the gravity Ind could you post a chart with some signals youve taken using it please.  
  
And thanks for posting its all going into my arsenal ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Le pip  
  
here is your chart with my explanations..I hope they make sense  
  
For people visiting the thread its all gone quite mainly due to the fact Im still working on perfecting the entry.It gives good signals and think Ive cracked the signal against a trend problem ..just looking at the stop..either move to break even when we hit the middle ma line OR take the stop 1 pip above high of bar for a short and 1 pip below low of bar for a long..  
  
Or like i use it on Futures ( trading 2 contracts or always in pairs)when i make 1 full point I close and move stop to break even on 2nd ....then close 2nd at +3 giving me 3 full points per pair of contracts traded ,3 full points on ER2 futures is $300  
  
Still experimenting

Hi Paulus... Thanks for getting back to me... great explanations.   
  
I follow most of what you noted, but could you be a explain a little more about the first red arrow (and why it's a no-go related to bar A)? From what I see, the white Stoch line is still pointing up, so I don't follow.  
  
Also, on the last two arrows where you say "no past tick up bar." I don't understand how you're applying that phrase in each case. Are you saying the candle is a tick? Or are you talking about the main line in the Stoch? Do you mean we take the signal only when the white line angles up? So, if it angles up a bar or two earlier, it invalidates the signal?   
  
Again, thanks for your explanation and your time.

Ive been trading for most of the day missed out the real early period flat at mo..but have had 11 signals got 9 of them .. system on +57 pips  
  
been taking lmt buy and sells all day only missed 1 signal due to the fact the signal didnt retrace to hit my lmt buy,.  
  
I find the process easy I get the order ticket up and select pending order and set stop and tp to roughly the right levels..   
  
I then wait for 2-3 secs till the end of the 5min candle and click on one of the arrows in the 'at price' box this gives me as close as possible the close of the candle and then click submit and the order gets filled..waiting to get hit  
  
This way I gain 2 pips on the tp as on a long I get in 2 pips lower than the close of the bar so the spread is covered and as my stop is fixed..if long I set stop to 1 pip below low of entry candle so my loss is 2 pips smaller also.  
  
the missed signal was 7 pips but have gained 2 pips on the other 10 so one way or another am 20pips up less the 7 on the signal that didnt get triggered, so 13 pips better off so far for using the lmt buy and sell  
  
Using 2 x stoch one is standard 532 the other the Stoch DiNapoli set to 833  
  
Will post final results tonight with my template ..  
  
The Keltner moves forward in it evolution  
  
Actual trades +4+3-6+7+13-4+15+12-5+11+7 = +57  
  
Flat now waiting for a short

You're doing great with this. I've traded futures myself for many years, mostly ES and ER, occasionally YM. I've got to keep trying on your method -- I just don't have it yet.  
  
Are you using the opposite end of the keltner as your target?

Hi BenQ  
  
Yes thats right if long tgt set to top K line if short set to bottom K line.  
  
seems to work well if you long and the price is rolling over and it looks like its going to move against you the top K line comes down to meet your fill and you get taken out albeit for a smaller amount but it saves you in a way if it rolls over slowly  
  
Er2 really good I like it tried YM alot of my friends trade it but never got on with ES is moves in a strange way..  
  
the good thing about US futures is that the dep required to trade is so low now so its a good return for your money

Outstanding results, just outstanding! Fine job of tweaking and evolving. Congrats!!! Gone for a couple days, wanted to thank you for all efforts. If possible, could you check in on my thred Thur. and Fri.? Might be a few questions there you could help answer. Mine is a very simple system as you know. Thanks again Paulus, have a profitable rest of week and a great weekend. Talk to you soon. Highest Regards, X

Am I reading this trade right? The candle time is 15:05 gmt. We had a close above k line, down candle, stoch ticking down, so enter last few seconds of candle.  
  
Price went to midline, stop moved to B/E. Price reversed and took out stop for a scratch trade.  
  
Did you take that trade? What was your result -- or if not, why not?  
  
Thanks

The bar that closed outside the keltner is two bars before your white vertical line. Are you saying the downbar has to occur within a certain time?  
  
edit: Are you saying that if we do NOT have a downbar at the same time stoch ticks down then no trade?

yes thats correct..other wise taking it to the extreme you could have a series of doji candles with stoch coming down from OB into OS and then get a down bar...you cant go short ..  
  
it has to happen with stoch ticking down at same time as candle is a down candle all happening from above the 80 line..ie bar before signal is above 80 then down tick with down candle..thats your signal

See you and Ben dropping in. Seems some folks had the wrong stochastic setting and BEn helped figure that out and put folks on the right path. Closing shop now. Thanks again. X

That's my problem then --there are fewer of these actual signals than I was taking. Sometime tonight can you post a pic of your trades from today?

Hi  
  
Its 11pm and im very tired lols so I can list my entry  
  
+4+3-6+7+13-4+15+12-5+11+7 = +57  
  
Here is a snippet chart of 2 signals with entry criteria..allot of signals may be filtered out from my 1st posting but we have to refine this system and as you lose losers you inevitably lose winners ..personally if I bank 20-30 pips a day Im a happy bunny...  
  
Going in with a lmt buy or sell I found very easy an EA just to let you know when either a candle closes out side of the K lines OR an EA that tells you when both stoch are under the 20 or above the 80 would be helpful.  
  
In my futures trading I have a baby listener by my pc I can then go downstairs or make a coffee even watch some Tv out of the trading room.When i hear my wave file I know I have 5mins to get to the pc and look...crude but effective.  
  
I hope the chart explains the entries clearly for you I have also attached the DiNapoli stoch and my template.Enjoy this may not be the full and final version..as Edison once said...blah blah blah...lols

Nice, thank you. What do you mean by the lower stoch "takes no further part"?

Hi Benq  
  
I only use that stoch to help eliminate a few signals,its the fast top stoch that helps with entry.  
  
by saying 'it takes no further part' just means that by the time it goes OB or OS its done its job for me in determining a signal or not..I dont watch it again untill the next signal..it has no input into the entry that all done by the faster top stoch  
  
BUT ...... as you know I'm completely open to suggestions  
  
Cheers

Here is the screen shot. trades with center of gravity cannot be back tested, as it changes its position to include most of the candles within its range after sometime. So if you check the below screen after sometime you will find that the COG has shifted. I use IBFX mini account and I set a target of 4 to 5 pips. I will post screen shots as and when i trade.  
I take just one or two trades a day during asian session as I have a full time job.

Hi Paulus,  
  
Your system looks pretty cool. I just had your template up on a 15 minute chart (more by accident than intent). Have you ever tried to apply this to longer time frames? Here was a move of about 30 pips on GBP/JPY.

Thanks cC  
  
No I havnt looked at other time frames,once i get the 5min firing on all cylinders I'l look at a few other time frames for those longer term bigger gains..  
  
Thanks for posting the chart   
  
Ive had a good result today on the K system ....  
  
Rules i used today in the trading room   
  
Longs  
  
_signal in normal way  
  
_

  1. Price closes below bottom K line
  2. Stoch Di below 30
  3. Stoch normal below 20
  4. Stoch normal ticks up at the same time as an up bar

_Entry_

  1. Set a lmt buy 2 pips below the close of the signal candle
  2. Wait to get taken
  3. Fix the stop 1 pip below the low of the entry candle
  4. Set target is 10 pips

The fixed target worked well today ,even in trends as Im going counter trend the 10 pip tgt has a chance of getting hit.With a fixed stop if we enter with a lmt buy 2 pips below the close we are in effect getting in minus the spread and reducing our potential loss by 2 ticks  
  
We are also increasing the chances of getting out with our target.  
  
The draw back is the move can happen with out price coming down to your lmt buy.  
  
_Example  
_  
Signal at 10  
Set lmt buy at 08  
Low of bar 04 set stop to 03 ( stop is 08 - 03 = 5 pips)  
target 10 pips so set at 18   
  
Without lmt buy but entering with mkt order  
  
Signal at 10  
mkt entry at 12  
Low of bar 04 set stop to 03 ( stop is 12 - 03 = 9pips)  
target 10 pips so set at 22  
  
Signals today  
  
-2+10+9+10+10+10-8+10+10-7-5+5+10-7-7+10 ( not filled not counted) -2+1+10 = +57  
  
Cheers Paulus  
  
ps daily tgt of 30 pips hit early in the day

Possible improvement.   
  
If anyone has the time, back test.  
  
May want to trade this only in the direction of daily trend only and only between specific times.  
  
Money management not best. May want a second entry (smaller or larger amount than first entry) at a better price in order to prevent spikes. Who ever has the time should back test.

Paulus,  
  
Congrats on the system. Looks like it is coming along quite well! And thank you for all the clear, annotated charts. They really do help.  
  
I just wanted to ask one thing. Where did the signal line on the 5,3,2 stoch go to? One minute it was there and then gone the next. Is that no longer a requirement?  
  
Thanks,  
Scott

Prices are never too high to begin buying or too low to begin selling.

Hi Scott,  
  
Im an aggressive trader by nature on futures I go long on the next up bar after a down bar outside of the bottom K line..  
  
When i moved over to Forex I did use both main and signal line but found I was using just the main line more and more as it got me in alot quicker.  
  
In the next 20 mins I will be posting the week results with a chart showing a signal for clarification.  
  
Cheers

Hi Jeta   
  
Yes agree with you about the times ..I really don't know yet the best times to trade EURUSD I'm still getting my head around the fact its 24hr,but a very valid point and one I have to look at.  
  
Again the daily trend I can see where you are coming from but this technically is a scalping system and the pull backs we get in a down trend im sure we can profit from,we also have to have a mechanical way of assessing the daily trend..possibly the CCI above 0.00 longs ...below 0.00 short but I think it will be very restrictive...but again a valid point  
  
2nd entry yes possibly I enter with a lmt buy or sell so get in 2 pips better could enter a 2nd 1 pip below that perhaps again some thing I have to look at  
  
thanks for the comments its all valid  
  
cheers

Hi All  
  
We may of fixed the K trading system its taken 10 days or so but it now looks very promising.  
  
I will post my template and the Stoch Di with this post also  
  
SIGNAL LONG

  1. Price closes below bottom K line
  2. Stoch Di below 30
  3. Stoch normal below 20
  4. Stoch normal ticks up at the same time as an up bar

_Entry_

  1. Set a lmt buy 2 pips below the close of the signal candle
  2. Wait for the lmt buy to get filled
  3. Fix the stop 1 pip below the low of the entry candle
  4. Set target is 10 pips

RULE

  1. Once we have our lmt buy order placed we wait for price to come down to our set lmt.As long as the calculated target has not been hit we leave this order open
  2. To make things clearer if the close of the candle is 10 we set our lmt buy to 8 our prospective target is 18 as long as price hasn't hit 18 we leave our lmt buy open
  3. If the target of 18 ( example above) is hit and we havnt been filled on our lmt buy of 8 yet then at that point we cancel our order and start looking for another signal
  4. If we get a signal in the opposite direction whilst in a trade we reverse

The figures below are all signals generated and are manually back tested ,I live traded several ...as no EA is available the manual back test was the only option open to me.  
  
The signals are taken from the whole session 0.00 to to 0.00 Monday 19th up to Friday 23rd   
  
  
  
Monday  
+10-2-2+10+10+10+10-5-3+10+10+10-11+10+10+10 =+87 pips  
  
Tuesday  
-3-1+10+10+10-8+10-7-6+10+10+10+10+10+10-5+10+10-2+10 = +88 pips  
  
Wednesday  
+10-3+10-2+10+10+10-8-5-5+10-4+10+10 = +54  
  
Thursday  
+10-4-3+10-3+10-7-7+10-5-5+10-4+10-2+10 = +30  
  
Friday  
-4+10+10-6+10-3+10-4-9+10+10-2+10+10+10 = +62  
  
Im very happy with the above results esp the loser/winner ratio in terms of hits and size..it gives a fairly good risk return.This is done by taking the lmt buy and sell to reduce the losing trades and exit the winning trades quicker  
  
A target of 30 pips a day is achievable I think and seems to be a good cut off point...no point in sitting in front of the pc all day !   
  
A couple of signals a day were not taken as the lmt order was not hit before the signal hit its target so a potential 20 pips on average per day is missed by these trades but is outweighed I think by the tighter stops.  
  
The chart I have posted shows a 'messy' signal to show you how the lmt buy order works there are other signals on the chart but not marked some winners some losers.  
  
I have also included an example of your ticket once you are filled on the lmt price you can go into your account management and click on 'modify ticket' to adjust stop and tp to the exact pip

Is there a 1 click trading method like in VT Trader?  
It's just so damn slow when you manually enter a trade with MT4.  
Press F9 -> select pair (happend a few times that I thought I'd trade the pair I'm currently viewing but instead I traded somethingelse because it was not selected in the dropdown. -> Loss) blabalbbla

Hello Paulus  
First of all thank you for your nice and simple system. Re your above post #200 your signal candle was the long one (close below bottom k line) .Why did not take the candle before that as your signal bar although it was under k and both stock were under 20& 30 ?

Look at the rules under "Signal Long" #4....ya wait for an uptick of the normal stoch at the same time price closes up.

Hi Tj  
  
Yes must be frustrating ..thats one reason in Futures trading I used Ninja trader  
  
If you use a separate data feed in VT trader you could possibly use Ninja its a great programme and easy to use

Harar  
  
Hi  
  
We have to have a tick up on the top stoch as thats the faster of the 2 with an up bar..the lower stock 90% of the time follows suite but as long as its below its 30line im happy to carry on with the trade  
  
Its a traffic light effect... we need 4 green lights  
  
green light - price closes below bottom K line  
green light - fast ( top ) stoch below 20  
green light - stoch Di below 30  
green light - top stoch ticks up with price  
  
I get the ticket up with 10 -20 secs to go and as soon as i see we are ending the bar I click 'place'  
  
Then go to modify ticket and adjust tp and stop to exact pips  
  
Hope that makes sense  
  
cheers  
paul

I must stress though to those that scan this great forum..you will have losing trades on this method.  
  
I dont know of any one any where who doesn't have losing trades  
  
And in all the statistics on any system there will be lurking the 6 losers on the trot the big losing days..  
  
On the flip side the stats are also in there for the 6 winners in a row and the really big winning day.  
  
Please please no matter what system you are using don't bin it because you have a bad day look at it and try to find out what went wrong.  
  
This may not be the full and final version of the K system I dont know one thing I do know the the less we expose ourselves to the market the better for our risk... get your 20 or 30 or what ever fig you want to put on it and close down for the day.  
  
Look at it this way you start at 8am the markets great the moves are excellent 3 trades and 3 x 10 pips.. you stop at 30..You exposure has stopped you no longer risk the losing runs the quiter times.  
  
If Im on 27 pips for the day and my next signal moves 3 pips I close it and bank the 30 for my money managment  
  
If I posted a system here that made a 10 pip loss every day on a back test for the last 365 days it wouldn't get 1 post and no interest..but If I posted that it ends up with a 10 pip loss but at some time during the days on each of the last 365 days it was up by 40pips at some time it would get alot of interest ..   
  
I always look at what its done during the session rather than whats its done at the end of the day  
  
Im not preaching just letting you know how my mind works  
  
I done allot of research into this when i traded Dax futures I worked out hope much per hour i was making if i stopped at a certain points value each day...It showed back then I would earn more per hour stopping at a certain value than if I traded the whole session.  
  
Rather than post the link I have copied the actual post dated 25-1-2003 from a BB called Technical Traders of which Im a moderator  
  
_**End of week totals week 1**_  
Dax = £17 per point   
_**Scan A**_  
Stopping at +3 = 140points in 24.5 hours of trading = 5.7 points per hour   
All day = 160 points in 55 hours of trading = 2.9 points per hour   
Strike rate up to +3 = 63%   
_**Scan B**_  
Stopping at +3 = 140points in 21.5 hours of trading = 6.5 points per hour   
All day = 260 points in 55 hours trading = 4.7 points per hour   
Strike rate up to +3= 62%  
  
If time is off an issue and the thought of sitting in front of the pc for 11 hours is daunting then the above shows that to stop at +3 winners over losers is the way to go.   
Look how low the points per hour dropped to when trading the whole session.Agreed more money would of been made if you traded the whole sesion,but at a far slower rate.One of my aims I hope to achieve with my trading apart from financial independance and security for my children is the freeing up of far more leisure time.I do not intend to give up the day job just to sit in front of a PC screen 11 hours a day.   
  
Both scans avergaged around the same time for +3 wins 21-23 hours per week.  
  
_**Putting this into financial gains(+3)**_  
Scan A and Scan B achieved the same 140 points or £2,380 not inc costs for 1 contract in 23 hours max for last week.   
_**Costs were as follows (+3)**_   
Scan A 41 trades = $230 around £139   
Scan B 56 trades = $313 around £189   
  
Ok its only 1 week but the result make my pursuit of this seemingly worth while.   
Will keep you up to date with any developments   
Paulus

Paulus, I agree 100%. One problem for me now is that I work full-time during the day here (8:00 to 17:00 ET), though I am usually able to loosely monitor a trading system such as yours. I'm thinking an EA for your method would be ideal. I just started building EAs about a month ago, but I might be willing to give it a try.

Prices are never too high to begin buying or too low to begin selling.

For getting an entry signal the conditions 2 (stoch Di below 30) and 3 (Stoch normal below 20) must be true when the price closes below bottom K line (1) or also must still be true after getting the first bar up?  
  
  
In the manual backtest done for this week, could you please confirm that you considered the spread for calculating result of your loosing trades...I guess so, but just want to confirm it...  
  
Did you check whether the system could also be used on other currencies with same settings and same kind of success?  
  
Thank for sharing this nice system....

THF  
  
Any help you can give will be gratefully appreciated .. I know nowt about writing EA's but will be looking into it my self when i get back off my hols  
  
Emeric33  
  
yes spread was taken into account on the results .. not looked at other currencies picked this one due to the 2 pip spread..spent most of the week looking for a few fixes I had to do to convert the system from my US Futures trading to Forex   
  
Its ooking pretty sound now

Hi, Paulus. A couple questions when you get a chance...  
  
1) Regarding your #4 rule for going long (stoch normal ticks up at the same time as an up bar), does it matter if that stoch rises above 20 when it ticks up on this bar? Is that still a valid signal?  
  
2) When I attached the DiNapoli stochs, I got two lines. Should I hide one of those, and if so, which one?  
  
Many thanks...  
  
Scott

On the Di stoch ..under colors select none for 1 white for 0  
  
or load the template i posted earlier

A couple more questions for Paulus (if he is still around) or anyone else that might know...  
  
1) Can there be any dojis between the signal bar and the entry bar and the signal still be valid? I am assuming not.  
  
2) As far as a take profit, I know it was recently set at 10 pips. What about if the opposite band is hit? Is that also a take profit level? I just took a trade today where much of the movement was on the entry candle (14:45 GMT) and so the trade had only moved 4 pips (+2 profit) by the time it hit the opposite band. So I closed it out for a 2-pip win. Turns out it only had maybe one more pip available before turning in the other direction, so it was the right move.

Hi,  
I think someone asked for this here in this thread.  
I found it here in FF, programmed by "mladen".  
Hope it helps.

Hi,  
I just realized this other one has a bunch of extra features.  
Paulus: now you can also watch TV downstairs and leave the baby monitor on (as you can do with Futures), this one has sound alerts, as well as email alerts (someone said he worked with internet access but couldn't stand all day in front of the monitor?)  
The color blocks is also useful, you don't want to be "staring" at the screen all day long, you can be anywhere in the room and have this big blocks telling you if you must be paying attention or can continue reading.  
This is also by Mladen.  
Hope it helps.

Great find, thanks Batoobah! Note: I overlayed that ColorStoch on the Stoch in Paulus' template, and it looks different. The settings I used were 5, 3, 2, like for the other stoch.  
  
By the way, there is this great training tool if someone wants to practice. It's a trading simulator:

I first tried with the first one, and I saw a discrepancy, I don't know if it's because I used SMA and the other one was with a different setting.  
Anyway, I tried it with the second one and it worked Ok.  
  
I'm attaching here the screenshot.  
It's the yellow one and the last one with the red and green parts.

Hi Paulus:  
This last indicator has something I think can help you explain the "what if the bar I'm monitoring goes up and it's above the 20 line while I'm at it", since the bar is red only if the last point of the curve is below 20. Even if there's a good part of the line below 20, if the last point is above it the line turns gray instead of green (or red).

Hi,  
Today was a particularly (word? sorry about my english) bad day to start testing this system. I won one and lost about 5, all in EUR/USD.  
I have a question.  
In the image I attach, in the green arrow, is this a good signal gone bad? Or is there something I'm not seing?  
All going north (even DiNapoli although it's almost horizontal), red is out, green enters, I enter...  
Thanks in advance.

I think you're going to have those. If price all of a sudden decides to start trending, this is going to happen. I had some this morning too. Have been looking at some things to see if there is a way to predict this better but haven't come up with anything yet.

I'd just want to know if that specific case was a good moment (because of the signals). I don't mind losing, if I know I have the rules straight. I think it's better to lose and know why you lost, than to win and don't know why you did it.

I'm assuming you mean the one where the green arrow is? That looks like a valid signal to me. Would have taken that one too.

Hey Paulas,  
Back from vacation, and it looks like you have made some nice changes to the system. Trying to get all caught up on things and just had some clarifications.  
  
I will post my template and the Stoch Di with this post also  
  
SIGNAL LONG

  1. Price closes below bottom K line
  2. Stoch Di below 30
  3. Stoch normal below 20
  4. Stoch normal ticks up at the same time as an up bar

_Entry_

  1. Set a lmt buy 2 pips below the close of the signal candle
  2. Wait for the lmt buy to get filled
  3. Fix the stop 1 pip below the low of the entry candle
  4. Set target is 10 pips

Are we still waiting for the close of the next bar to be an up bar and using that as our signal bar (with which we are taking 2 pips reverse of the close as entry price)?  
Or are we just waiting for an up tick on the bar, and an uptick on the stoch at the same time, no matter how much time the bar has left etc?  
Been playing around with it this evening a little bit but this part has me a little confused. Seems the successful way to get into a trade and not just be completely passed by, is to have an up bar in the last 10 seconds or so, use the current market price in that last 10 seconds of the bar to subtract 2 pips from for our entry price. Then 10 seconds later after it closes, we use the low of the bar as our stop, and add 10 pips to our entry price as our target?  
Could be way off as usual, please enlighten me ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
Hope you had a good holiday as well.

This basically is a "revert to the mean" system, and is a **good one**.  
It will work great when there is no trend in place, and it will fail when there is a trend in the traded timeframe, because it will try counter-trend entries.  
What should be really added to this system is a trend filter: just trade it when there's no trend. When trending, trade another system.

Hi Batoobah  
  
That was a good valid set up but looking at the bar and taking the n2 pips lmt you sould of only lost 2-3 pips on that signal with a tgt of 10 it gives us quite a good risk return.  
  
Im still on hols so havnt got time to nswer all the questions posted but if you set a lmt buy 2 pips below the close of the signal bar and set your stop 1 pip below the of the signal bar your losses will be kept to a min  
  
Or if you prefer you can set your stop to _break even when the price touches the middle average K line_..that will save aquite a few but may also mean you will miss out on some good winners.  
  
Was there not a nice short signal 16 bars from the left on your screen shot that may of gone for 10 pips ? you would of got filled on the lmt sell around 4-5 bars after the signal bar  
  
sorry have to run   
Cheers  
  
Paulus

Hi Paulus:  
Hope you had a great time on the islands.  
I was wondering what do you think about Jagui's comment about your system working only when there's no trend.  
I've made some backtesting and in fact sometimes I see that.  
I've tried some additional indicators so I can reduce the entries only when this extra indicator tells me, but with no luck.

Hi Bat  
  
Yes great thanks one of the best hols Ive had  
  
Im using RSI to filter the trend signals and its working fine at mo.. Im going to post at the end of the week with new template if it carries on.I looked at the stoch but couldn't get it to filter as good..  
  
We had few strong trends yest and it filtered out repetitive signals against the growing trend..not all that would be impossible but enough to make it matter   
  
Thanks jag .. It was a neat idea all ideas are greatly appreciated  
  
the timer is also working great thanks for that Bat

I've tested RSI, SAR and TRIX, on 5min.  
Trix works nice.  
I've tried 14 and it **__seems__** to give a good signal.  
I'm stilltrying to make a rule out of it.

Hi there. Am as green on these indicator downloads as can be. Is there a way you can walk me through getting your indicators into my mt4 system so I can have both your system and mine showing on the same chart? Am really fascinated by your methodology and want to learn more rapidly. Can make myself available at any time deemed appropriate so as to do this if you believe it to be a good idea. Thanks, Keith ("X")

Hi X,   
  
Put the indicators into the "experts/indicators" folder where you installed MT4, for example under "Interbank FX Trader 4".  
  
Put the template into the "templates" folder where you installed MT4, for example "Interbank FX Trader 4/templates".  
  
Restart your MT4 and then load the template. If you want to combine them with your indicators, don't use the template but pull the indicators on your chart individually to add them to yours.  
  
Hope this helps! Chris

Hey Paulus,  
  
Just started to look at this thread, as it got a mention over on Expats thread. I saw in the chat room that you have applied an RSI filter? Would you mind expanding on this please when you get a chance. Are you still using the same system?

when ever I down load an indicator or template etc I always saved them to my desk top so I know where they are

The fix saved me having several losses today so here it is  
  
Hi all  
  
Back off hols and thanks for the posts..I love the coloured Stoch makes things very easy on the eye. Do you think there is a chance of doing it with the DiNapoli Stoch....just a thought  
  
ok this may be a fix for the trend problem. One day last week it saved 40 pips of loss by keeping you out of most of the tending periods. It will cut out a few winners but overall it should save more.  
  
If you put an RSI set to 14 on your chart, and look at just the peaks we are not interested if it is above or below OB or OS..this technic is an offshoot of some thing that was taught on the Trader International course which I took 4-5 years ago.  
  
Its just simple diversity  
  
The chart below shows how to use the RSI and how to work out what peaks to use.  
  
The RSI is only used when we have signal in the same direction..so if we had short short short short short then we would use the RSI as a filter as these may be firing off in a trend against our signals.  
  
If we have Short long short long then we don’t use and the sequence is broken by a signal in the opposite direction  
  
Sooooooo  
  
Long long ( use) short (no need) short (use) short(use) long (no need) etc etc.  
  
Hopefully the chart below will explain better  
  
I have used a white dotted vertical line to show where the RSI peaks are they will always be 1 bar behind the actual signal bar  
  
As you can see the 1st long we take as it’s the 1st since the one before off the chart was a short.  
  
  
1st signal – We take  
2nd signal – If you look at the RSI peak we made a higher high so we leave  
3rd signal – Again we made a HH on the RSI so we leave  
4th signal – We can take as the RSI peak made a lower low  
  
I must stress this will also stop you taking you some winners but I think stopping the losers is more important. If you had 6 wins and 6 losers for the day and applying this technique cut that down to just 2 wins for the day then we have achieved our aim.  
  
Again the system is ongoing and this I suspect is not the full and final version.  
  
  
  
Paulus

When applying your template to the chart, only Dinapoli stochastic appears. Do you use mainly Dinapoli stoc or classic stoc for validation of the signals?  
  
Thanks for this nice system

paulus, Thanks for sharing your system. After watching some of your trades there on ex's trading room, I had to come and read what this was all about. It looks really good.   
  
If I get some time I will put together an EA for you. I am not pro at it, but this is a simple system, and I am sure it could be done without too much trouble. In fact, I wrote an ea for a system I used for a while that is similar to your original system, but uses envelopes.

Paulus, can you confirm that these are all the indicators that you use with your template? Did I miss any?  
  
Emeric33 & all....I found that if you don't have all of these in your indicator folder they won't show up on your chart when you load the template.

Put every thing apart from the template in your   
  
MetaTrader -experts - indicators folder   
  
Put the template in your   
  
MetaTrader - templates folder  
  
If you have MT open..shut it and reopen...you should now find the template in your template tab and the rest listed in the inds tab under custom  
  
BUT if have put every thing where it should be..you need only load the template as it will find for itself what it needs

by the way paulus what makes you change from futures to forex , if the very simple system you have posted at the starting of the thread was profitable on futures and when i look at the chart of russel i find it so obviously profitable and maybe on sp too

Paulus...  
  
Concerning the peaks of the RSI, on the image it looks like   
you are measuring the RSI peaks from Signal to Signal,   
and not from the most recent "previous" RSI peak to   
the most current RSI peak, right?  
  
In other words, are you concerned with the RSI peaks  
only from the _previous_ RSI peak nearest the _previous_ Signal...  
and then "measuring" to the most _current_ Signal and it's  
associated _current_ RSI peak?  
  
I hope my question is clear.

Paulus, is there a limit to how for the signal bar can move to make it an valid signal? I am wondering about that trade on my first chart that says I am not sure about this on. The signal moved a long ways down past the k band, then continued to move down (but not to the + 10 mark) then came back up. So the entry was after the move was over.

Hi David  
  
Well I'm aggressive so I tend to take them all unless if its a short its through the bottom band and visa versa for longs..  
  
But if you see a pattern to losers on big bars let me know

Looks like you are doing well today. Nice! Go to the church and light a candle for me if you would. Worse day I can remember. Lousy price action all day. If I am reading your signals correctly, you are up around 60 pips. Does this sound right?

Just want to make sure..  
  
For example to get a valid long signals, you want both normal stochastic and dinapoli stochatic being under 20...correct?..not only one of them?

em  
  
Ordinary stoch under 20 ...Di under 30 for longs... then just normal to tick up  
  
Ex.. bad luck yes system up 70 pips got my 30 sorry to hear about the session   
  
Had around 10 K followed by X signals todayI think 9 made 15 1 made its break even  
  
Rectangular boxes are the combined signal... arrow K ...tick X ...cross 'no signal filter rule'

Ok. Have a good trip. Are these shaded areas confirmed as potential buy and sell areas? I see that if used as such, I simply initiate the order and then hold until price reaches the middle of the bands. At that point, I can eith flow right through with my own plan or hold until price touches the other side of the bands. Is that fundamentally correct?

Greetings Paulus and all, This is my first post to forex factory. I have read this thread from start to finish and tried this method on demo today. Very nice work. I found myself missing many entries because I was simply doing other things. To show my appreciation for this thread I have modified the Keltner channel code to include a simple alert when either of 2 conditions are met: (1) price close > upper keltner AND stoch >= 80 (2) price close < lower keltner AND stoch <= 20  
  
I hope this proves useful and you can tell me if there are any issues. I find that some good entries are missed because 80/20 may be too stringent but they can be adjusted. Also this code is not very far off from being a very simple EA.  
  
Here is complete list of changes:  
1) changed name to Keltner Channel Paulus mod02.mq4  
2) changed default Lenth = 10  
3) changed default TimesATR = 1.0  
4) changed default color to red  
5) added arguments for: Alerts_ON=true, StochKPeriod1=5, StochDPeriod1=3, StochSlowing1=2, Upper_Stoch_Threshold=80, Lower_Stoch_Threshold=20  
  
Things that could be added: email alert, ???

This system has been working great for me with the original settings. The only thing that I added to it were auto pivots and the 60 ema (you may want to add the 200 also). What I look for patiently are set ups where the stoch is OB or OS, a closing outside of the KC, and confluence with a pivot or the ema that provides normally some resistance. I concentrate on one currency cross, EUR/USD. This does a few things. It keeps me focused on one currency, keeps my spread low, and forces me to take only the best set-ups. I also keep an eye on price action on the 30min and 4hr, but when you are scalping the 5min, normally they don't have an impact unless you hit a 4hr trend line. I am also willing to TP at the middle line in the KC. This is usually good for about 5 pips or so. I look to grab about 10 pips a day at higher leverage and have been consistent with it. I affirm to myself that I am a sniper and I will only shoot when I am very confident that I will hit. Patience pays.

here is my first version of the the keltner ea. It still has some bugs, but I thought I would post it, since I am not going to have much time for a few days to work on it.  
  
Just as a note, this is in its early stages, so don't use it on a live account.  
  
Also I noticed that the colored stochastic set to 532 actually reads like a regular stochastic set to 533. So the ea is using a stochastic of 533 to match my colored stochastic on my template.  
  
Have fun with it, and let me know what it does wrong.  
  
David

Ex  
  
Yes that chart look fine and sounds right what u are saying..although the draw down on K is more than the X system.. hence the proposed 'stop at 20 25 or 30' for the day.  
  
Peej.. great work many thanks for this will run later today and let you know.How about a sound alert so u can wander from the PC but leave sound alert on ? may be useful  
  
Hoss.. excellent post the theory sounds solid going short with resistance above you in one form or another on a market that is over stretched increase your odds of a win dramatically..Thanks for the post and will watch the pivots and ema on my chart ..it wont stop me trading but some thing may click and this is what a thread like this is all about sowing seeds for each other  
  
Alnames the latest inds and template is on post 254 but hasnt got the ea for telling u if the k lines are broken or the inds by hoss  
  
David ..great work and thanks for your time on this will load and watch question can I run 2 or 3 ea's on the one chart.This forum is great with people willing to kelp out and share tyhier skills for the benefit of us all  
  
I thanks you all... may the fight go on.. take a breath put your head down and walk into the storm...lols

You can't run two ea's on the same chart, but you can open another chart and put another ea on that chart. As long as they have a different magic number, they will not interfere with each other.

> Interesting system. I trade a variable of the same. Trade only Eur/Usd on the 5m tf. Utilize Stochastic set at 5-3-3, ADX set at 4, a 2sma and 5 sma with a weighted close. Trade from 5 - 11 a.m. pst and average about 10 trades per session with good results (90%). Look to take three (3) pips of net profit and trade 8 contracts per trade. Has been very consistant and profitable for the past eight months. Currently indure a 2 pip spread and have had very little difficulty. Can obtain confirmation by dropping down to 1m tf to time entry and exit. Never trade during "red" news announcements. Thanks for sharing. Keith

Hi Expat,  
  
thanks a lot for publishing your template setup. I've been staring at it for some time, but I don't seem to be able to come up with entry rules that give a 90% hitrate like you stated. Surely not every SMA crossing is an entry, how do you use the Stoch & ADX in conjunction with these crossings?  
  
thanks

The SL 1 means 1 pip past the signal candle.  
the limit amount is you set your limit order to. if it is one, it will enter the trade when it retraces 1 pip from the close of the signal candle.  
The start and stop times are based on your broker time.  
the slippage, is that the max you will allow your trade to be off. So if you enter long at 1.5570, you may get in at 1.5575 if the market moves really fast right when the order is sent.  
  
Sorry I didn't explain much of how it works.

Might be a dumb question, but instead of waiting to see figured someone might be able to answer it quickly. If I want to play with this test EA provided, am I required to still have all the indicators on the chart, does the ea need them to run?  
It's been awhile since I've had to play with this method again, and don't have time just this second to hunt down all the indicators and settings again.  
Thanks!

Ok, I quickly went thru and reloaded all the indicators in case the EA needed them (which I think it does).  
I also had to change the EA itself to use the newly modified keltner signal file, instead of the original. The new one fires off the alerts.  
I am not sure if I have the correct settings for all the indicators, are all the settings still the same as the #1 post here? If not, maybe paulus can updated post #1 with all the new indicators, template, settings etc?  
  
I did get an alert already, stating the keltner and stoch indicated a signal, however the EA hasn't opened an order. Will have to watch it longer to see if it's working or not.   
If anyone else has been playing with the EA, can you let me know if it is opening trades or not?  
  
Thanks

It has been opening some, in fact the problem with it right now seems to be that it opens too many after a loosing trade.  
  
Remember that it uses more than just the k bands to signal a trade. You have the rsi filter, and the two different stochastic indicators. Then it also needs to retrace back to the limit level (default is 2 pips).  
  
I can't remember if I left all the all the comments in the one I posted, but if you don't have a bunch of information on the left had side of your chart, you can uncomment them.  
  
If you do have them, this is what they mean:  
  
Last signal bar - is the number of bars back to the last bar to signal a trade (stochastics are overbought or oversold, the bar before closed outside the k band)  
  
Second last signal - is the bars back to the signal bar before the last one  
  
Last signal direction- is the direction of the last signal bar (0=long, 1=short)  
  
second last signal direction- is the direction of the signal bar before the last one (if both are in the same direction, the rsi filter comes into play)  
  
pips moved - this is the max pips moved in the direction of the trade since the last signal bar (if this is past the tp level, it will not enter the trade on a retrace)  
  
rsi filter - 1 means it will enter a trade even if it is in the same direction as the last one, 0 means it will not.  
  
trading time - if it is 1 , it means your are in the time frame to be traded in (ie london, us, depending on your settings)  
  
last entry - this is the price it should enter on if it retraces back, if it does not retrace back to that point before it reaches it's take profit point, it will not enter a trade.  
  
last trade - the seconds since the last actual trade was entered with the same magic number and currency pair that the ea is on  
  
last sig - the seconds since the last signal bar  
  
  
Any way, I hope that is helpful.  
  
and yes, you need the indicators (I think the only one that is not already in metatrader is the k channel one) in your experts/indicators folder (and may need to restart your platform after copying them there) , but you don't need them on your chart.

It doesn't look like that ea is putting any trades on for you. I will have to do some more work on it next week. This week and the first of next week, I am going to be too busy to even think.

Thanks david. I can't say yet whether it is or isnt working, I just finally cleaned up the indicators so we'll see if that changes anything. The one stoch color with bars that was posted here the settings were all wrong, so once I figured that out maybe that will affect the ea's trades.  
I will try to watch it as much as I can tonight to find out if it's trading when it shouldn't or not trading when it should.  
Hopefully some others are playing with it also.

Well, after a day I see that the EA DOES place trades, however yeah it needs some work.  
I see like 20 trades in a row all losers, so it's almost like a machine gun firing on some of these, just keeps pumping them out right in a row, not sure why.  
Anyhow, at least it's trying, and I appreciate the work that was done so far. Hopefully, we can get this thing trading accurately soon.

That is usually because the stop,or take profit is set too close to the entry price, try raising your stop, and see if it fixes it. I am not sure how close they can be with ODL.

David,  
Here is a screenshot of what it did. It goes on much further down below and above what I caught in the jpeg as well, but this should give you an idea of what is happening. Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with to figure this out.  
thanks

ok, here is the second beta version of this ea. I think it is working better, but there are probably some more bugs.

Hi Paulus thanks for the info i will give it try at my own risk it would make it simpler to do it this way not having to think about the news coming out all the time .

That is going to be quite a breakthrough if an ea is developed to consistently catch the trades as they present themselves. You guys are doing some really interesting work here. Really nice pip counts most of the time. Will follow this closely as it sure would help augment what I try and do. Good job Paul. You have some very astute people working on your team here. Have a great day. See you in the salt mines. X

David,  
Thanks for the update, I am running it now and will let you know what I find.  
  
If I could add 2 suggestions?  
1\. can you make it so the candle timer stays intact when we add this EA, or put it in the info section the time remaining for the current candle?  
2\. would it be possible to make the keltner indicator name a variable setting? I am not sure how many others are using the newer keltner with the alerts. I have been manually editing your ea code to run the newer keltner (granted I could just rename the keltner instead, however I like to keep original file names to keep track of what's new and what's not etc).  
  
Thanks, I hope to share positive feedback on it's performance in a bit!

I have been reading over this system and i feel that it has a lot to offer. When looking it over i noticed (attached chart) the when Stoch are in either over bought or over sold right before it heads down the current candle is inside the previous candel. Not sure if anyone else picked up on this but it seems to move about 10 pip (where you enter) up or down. maybe insted of using RSI as a guide and keeping you in or out of trades perhaps this one bar inside the previous bar could be the signal. Looking it over for the past month i see a few examples where it headed up or down and reversed but if you put your stop at 1 pip above the previous bar you are only losing about 4-6 pip. Just thought i would add my 2 cents to this system and maybe help out a little.

Just a note and observation about this method. I think it provides excellent entry clues for other methods such as fibs and S&R trading. For example, if you do a fib of thursdays range a nice short entry was provided at the 50% retracement fib on friday at about 1:15am GMT (2nd red arrow). If you would have held this order for the duration of the fib move your looking at 150+ pips in your account.

Watching this EA for the last couple days, I think I am noticing it not placing trades when it should, or placing them late.  
However someone should verify the rules, as I am not positive I am up to date on them.  
Once the close is above keltner and above both stoch's, the next bar is ticking down. Isn't the order placed during the last 10 seconds of the down bar? The EA seems to place it into the next bar, not sure why. That is when it places the trade at all, I think since open tonight I have seen 2 triggers but EA didn't place any trades.  
Of course I could be missing something, as I still don't quite understand the RSI or I have the wrong RSI settings, as to me it looks pretty much like a flat line with very little movement. Maybe my RSI settings are wrong.  
Anyhow, will continue to watch and monitor the EA, hopefully other's are doing the same?

Had a little time before i have to put my daughter to bed and here is what i traded. Starting with SUNDAY OPEN this is when the markets opened up 3pm  
MST -6GMT.   
A - here is the first signal as you can see we are over sold in STOCH and looking for the bounce up, BUT the candle after the bar inside DID NOT move  
up i did not take the trade, there were 2 signals BOTH did not move up.   
B - Stoch are heading down the small bar is inside the previous bar +10  
c - Stoch are heading down the small bar is inside the previous bar +10  
D - Stoch are heading up NOW this bar formed and the previous candle did nto move but if you look 2 bars ahead it did move up - DID NOT TRADE  
THIS  
E - Stoch heading down bar inside the previous bar +10  
F - THIS IS A VALID SIGNAL the durrent bar engulfed the previous bar and STOCH are heading up +10  
G - Stoch heading down bar indisde the previous bar + 10  
H - was the last signal before i typed this....and looking at it now it did go up +10  
+60 pips from 3pm to 9 pm (mountain standard time MST)  
For what ever reason when one bar is inside of another bar and we are over bought or over sold wait for the one pip move up to confirm direction  
and then enter trade. Again this might be beginners luck but that seems to be a very powerful signal and back testing over the past month i have only  
found a handful of times where the signl would move then revers but if you place your stop on the previous bar you are risking about 5 - 8 pips.   
Hope this helps some of you  
J

On my previous post ignor the pip on the descriptions (+10) that was just a referance for me that shows it was a valid entry and pips were positive. The total pips were the total pips i gained in that period. I held 2 moves BUT i am not posting to claim pips you can make i just wanted to show what happens when one bar is inside another...

Thanks for sharing.  
To clarify a couple of points:  
1\. in example A, you are stating you are looking for a bounce up, do you mean a bounce down? You are looking to short there, so the next bar you want lower than the signal bar?  
2\. In example A, couldn't you have waited til the 5th bar after the open, where it is still over the stoch then drops on the next bar for entry?  
3\. are you using the keltner bands? If so, there are quite a few trades there (B,C,F) that aren't closed above the upper. This another adjustment you have made?  
  
Am sure I have more questions, but that's enough for now ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

David,  
Another EA observation (along with it not taking all the signals properly I think, as mentioned previously).  
The EA is taking a signal and behaving properly UNTIL the trade goes the wrong direction and stops out. At that point, instead of just taking the 6 pip loss and waiting for another signal, it is chasing it. As soon as it hits the stop, it instantly places a new order, with another 6 pip SL and the orignal TP level. I assume you did this on purpose but wasn't aware that was part of this trading system. Anyhow, in the case of 06:40 candle (fxdd time), this sucker just kept dropping like a bomb and the EA triggered 4 trades on this bar alone.  
I assume it did it for you as well so you are aware, but if you need more detail let me know.

Hi Jacioux,  
  
thanks for your observations. Do I summarize it correctly when you:  
\- take longs only after the bar following an inside bar breaks the inside bar to the upside  
\- take a short only after the bar following an inside bar breaks the inside bar to the downside  
\- apply both rules only when both price action is outside the Keltner bands (below it for going lon, above it for going short) and the STOCHs confirm direction.  
  
Would that be a correct summary of your findings?  
  
cheers  
Ohka

Hello Tazmaan,   
  
You are correct on the bounce down there.   
  
As for the band yes i do use them but i use them more for a comfirmation. Just to mention the bar inside does have a name its called a Harami (just learned that). So an example would be lets say i notice that the bars are getting closer to either the high or low band, i then wait for the Harami to form near that bar and then enter. I understand the system now wants the bar to be on the outside but i just noticed that when the Harami does form its close to the bars, and if it does form on the outside of the bands then the move has a lot more momentum with it. I also use the base system found on the first post of this system.   
  
My main point i want to point out is the formation of the bar before a move. Granted there are a lot of other valid signals and this system is just amazing i like to have more confirmation when i trade.

Ohka,   
  
That your summary is correct. But i also want to point out that i use the Keltner bands as a guide. If the Harami (bar inside) i wait for the Hatami to form only near the bands not inside them.   
  
If you go back to the first post whent he system is being described i use that as my templete and ONLY enter when Stoch are over bought or over sold. I NEVER enter even when the Harami forms and i DO NOT have the stoch in either postion. The base set up of this system is key i am only pointing out what the bars like to do before they make there move. I have only noticed this EUR/USD and the best time (i feel) to trade this is 10pm to 6 am (MST) that is about 6 hours behind GMT.   
  
thanks

Thanks, no it isn't supposed to chase after the trade like that, and I think I see what is happening. I am now working on fixing it. I will post an updated ea when I get it done.

fib and S/R notes - monday June 16  
  
My goal is to use the Paulus system for entries that i can keep going all day long. My bias was down today because trend is down until it changes right? Well it was down for a while but went up.  
  
(1) 61.8 fib of fridays range. Didn't stick.  
(2) 61.8 fib of fridays range. Stuck for a while.  
(3) Reversal. Gold and oil rising, 5350 Support (Euro seems to have support at all 00 and 50 levels), and 61.8 fib of up trend starting on Friday.  
(4) If you missed entry 3 then entry 4 was a nice break/retest of 61.8 level and it was a 38.2 retracement of the new uptrend and it was approx 5400 level support.  
  
I got trades 1,2, and 4. Missed 3 because my bias was down.

I am not sure how to do the first one? But you can use the clock ind that I attached, and it will show you the bar time, or you can take the comments out of my expert(they are only there so I can see what is going on with it.  
  
And I took care of number 2.  
  
Anyway, we are getting closer. Give this one a try, and let me know if it trades according to the plan.

Thanks David,  
I have put it in place and will keep an eye out. As far as the candle timer issue, in the next update if you could just move your comment section down a couple of lines it might fix the problem? Worth a shot.  
  
I have already noticed what I think was a missed trade. I am not sure what rules you are using specifically tho. From what I follow, bar closes above keltner and above both stochs, it's a valid signal. Next bar must be a down bar and in the last 10 seconds of the bar we place a sell order.  
I am not sure if this is what you are doing, but if so, the candle that just closed a trade wasn't placed (interbank time 05:05 is the signal, 05:10 should have been the entry bar).  
I'll watch out for our chasing issue in the meantime.  
Keep up the good work!! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

That is strange, because I am trading this on my alpari demo, and it got that trade.  
  
Anyway, this is how I understand what is needed to enter a trade (Paulus can correct me if I have it wrong![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)). Here is an example of a short trade:  
  
1- A close above the kelter channel with the stoch above 80 and the denapoli stoch above 70  
  
2- A down bar that also moves the stoch down  
  
3- The last signal needs to be a long trade, or the rsi peak to peak is sloping down  
  
4- The price needs to then retrace the limit amount before it reaches the Take profit level to enter the trade.  
  
P.S.   
  
Paulus, I just read on the X's thread that you had to take your daughter for an emergency operation. I hope all is well.

The rsi only comes into play on two consecutive trades in the same direction. As long as you have a long, short, long, etc.. you don't use the rsi (at least according to the system).

Results for 6/17 with latest EA  
10 trades   
6 wins  
4 losses  
+32 pips  
  
I still believe there are more trades to be had, however I am still not quite getting the RSI situation, as for the most part mine shows up as a straight line pretty much, not many peaks to speak of.  
  
David, in your EA, is it easily changeable to change the following?  
a. not use the RSI at all for confirmation  
b. place the order in the last 10 seconds of the bar (or even at close if that's easier to program) at market, instead of the 2 pips back or whatever it's using now.  
  
I think these are the only two things I am noticing less trades being taken between these two methods, and wouldn't mind running a backtest and forward test to see which method results in the best gains.  
  
Great job on this btw, wish this thread were more active, would love to see other people verifying the EA's trades and helping fine tune this thing to perfection.  
Maybe some interest will develop here soon.

Yep, you've done it correctly. As long as you have all the required indicators as well, it should trade (RSI, the two stoch's and the keltner bands). Make sure the keltner band indicator name matches the name in the EA settings.  
If it doesn't trade for awhile and you see that it should be based on what david's trade rules are, check the start time and end time settings as well in the EA.  
Glad to have you on board the test ship!

I will put the rsi as an option on the next version, and if you want it to open at the open of the next candle, just set the limit to 0 instead of 2.  
  
Thanks for testing, and the feedback.  
  
p.s. your rsi should look like the one I attached. It helps to uncheck the maximum and minimum setting on the rsi, so you can see the peaks better.

David,  
Thanks for the tip on the RSI, that did make a huge difference.  
Thanks for the other answers as well, I will start testing with just the open on the next bar as well.

Ok been gone a few days  
  
RSI works well to a degree but try this approach..its nothing new  
  
use your 5min chart as normal but ignore RSI ( stop crying your grown men lols)  
  
Open a 15min chart with same template,if you want remove the price bars...we want the inds  
  
We get a normal short signal on the 5min..take a look at the 15min stoch was it over sold is it now going down..in my case was it green is it now heading down from OS   
  
2 charts 1 is all the signals today so far..the 2nd is an example 5 and 15min time stamped at 9.30pm..the white +figures are the nornal 10 pip tp..the yellow is closing the 5min signal when the 15min stoch goes OS for the short OB for the long  
  
In my futures trading software I could easily write a scan to look at the 15min whilst on the 5 min..it would give me a green bar on the bottom of my chart..if green go with 5min sig if red leave easy peasy lemon squeezy

Anyone else run the EA in today's session? I was messing with the entry price on mine so I don't trust my results (and they weren't good today).  
If someone else was running it today in default form, please post your results for today.  
Thanks

Sorry, I just posted that chart to show what the RSI should look like. Those arrows were not trades, they are just the adx cross indicator I was playing with.  
  
  
Also, I like your new 15 min idea. I could make an indicator that would show the stochastic from the 15 min on the 5 min chart. Would that be helpful? Then if it turns out good, I could change the ea to us the 15 min as well.

don't worry about that, I just wrote some functions in there that I am not currently using in the main program (I should just delete them). It is just telling you that it is not going to include them in the compiling.

Hi Paulus,   
  
Not trying to pick holes here, just tying to understand the system. The long entry at 07:00, the stoch did not tick up on the up bar that followed the signal bar, is this no longer a rule?  
What about the long at the close of the 09:20 bar, is this not valid, that was a loss?  
There was another long at 11:10 that won.  
Just trying to see why they were not taken and wondered if i am missing something? Also, have you now abandoned the use of the RSI?  
Look forward to your reply.  
  
Steve

Also, here it the stochastic color indicator that I modified to let you put in the 15 min time frame.

Ok, here is all you need, including my template.  
  
the m-min-k is the template, keltner_0_4 is my ea, and the other three are just the indicators you will need.

Hi Steve..  
  
the long signal was where the arrow is we do have a down bar followed by an up bar but the stoch did not tick up at that point it was flat ..we then had the down bar then on the upbar with the arrow the stoch ticked up..confirmed by 15min   
  
The next signal (9.20) although it was later ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) the 15min stoch was heading down so not go for the 5min  
  
And well done on the 11.10 signal I missed that and it did win and was confirmed by the 15min..  
  
havnt abandoned the use of the RSI looking at other possibilities to reduce loses and increase the success rate of the signals left.  
  
When i brought this system over from Futures it was a completed system..but on Forex it was only 50% efficient..its only through the posts here that the system has been adapted and improved for Forex use..  
  
Hope all that helps

thank you very much! i see the template already starts on its own the EA, is it correct?  
  
Paulus, do you use the ea or you prefer to trade manual? This EA seems to produce a lot of loss

David,  
Are you not using the RSI any longer, or just not attaching it to your chart/template?  
I notice v4 of the EA, what changes have you made since the last?  
  
I have placed this on a brand new demo in stock form, so will start giving my daily results to the thread.

I just pulled the RSI off my chart, and am testing the 15 min stochastic. But the ea still uses the RSI. In fact, there is very little difference between v3, and v4. I didn't mean to put on version 4, as I had more planed to do before I put it up.

Very good, I'll continue to test as is and upgrade whenever a new one is available ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

I have been playing around with that stochastic set to the 15 min chart, and it looks like it gives the right reading for the current conditions, but looking back through the chart, I don't think it does. So visually back testing will not be accurate, although it should be good to trade with live. I just thought I would mention that, because it may be confusing.

Thanks Paulus,  
  
I see what you mean by that trade, i didn't realise that you would take an entry when the initial signal and entry was not valid. In this case, a further signal and entry bar confirmed and you took it, even though this second down bar was not outside the keltner band. In this case, all that was wrong with the first signal was the stoch not ticking up so the second one meant it was good to take.  
Hope your family recover soon.  
  
Cheers,  
Steve  
  
ps David has written an EA, has anyone tried to backtest these rules with Strategy Builder or something to see how it fairs in the past? Seeing as this is a mechanical approach, there seems no reason why this cannot be done?

Funny movement in the mkt today nice moves but few signals..  
  
here are the signals for 5min confirmed by 15min as outlined in my last couple posts.  
  
If using the 15 min stoch to close..ie when we go short on the 5min and the 15 min stoch is also over bought we close using the stoch on the 15min time frame when it reaches over sold we close...  
  
But  
  
What happens if it doesnt get to over sold and just reverses before geting below 20..easy one this when you go short on the 5min bring your trade to break even when we hit the bottom keltner line on the 5min..if we reverse on the 15min now we are at break even..we only want the best signals getting through using this 5/15 stoch combination.  
  
Result +9 +9 +0 +0 +0 +31 +0 = +41   
  
here are today signals..

Paulus,  
I thought you were testing this EA as well, and know all about it. You must be losing your mind? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
It's the one david wrote for this system, which you had stated you were going to play with as well.  
  
Anyhow, we need to redo some settings, as it's performing pretty badly.  
1win 9 losses today for a total of about -65 pips today  
  
Hopefully, we can get this thing fine tuned with your help.

Paulus, no problem on the not firing on all cylinders, I know you have alot going on with your family and I appreciate that. My comment was purely joking, and forgot about your daughter when I typed it, so please ignore it.  
  
Anyhow, here are my charts for 6/20. Hopefully they are clear enough. If not let me know how I can make them better and I will.  
  
Without extensive testing (have been concentrating on other things) but it seems to me your original method of placing the order with 10 seconds left of the next bar as long as it's a down bar for shorts and an up bar for longs seems to fair pretty well. Also having the TP at the opposite k band, and stop 1 pip below signal bar low.  
  
Maybe these are options we can discuss and play with with the EA to come up with a winner.  
  
Anyhow, here are the charts

Something is not right there. It should not be taking those trades, and your stochastic looks strange. Next time you get a trade that does not conform to the rules, take a snapshot (make sure it showes the info in the left so I can figure out what is going on).  
  
Anyway, here is what my chart looks like. Notice where put the red line. It looks like that would be around 20:10 on your chart, your is just coming out of overbought, and mine has been oversold, and just ticked up for the buy signal.

Well, not quite sure what's going on. I put all the files you provided in your last post, as well as your template on a demo account and let it run. So I assumed it would be the exact same setup you had going.  
Maybe we need to verify all settings with each other?  
Not sure why they would be different if I am using your template.  
Any ideas?  
I did change the minimum SL to 1.0 and the limit to 0.0, but I am not sure when I did that now :/  
I'll return it to stock form before the session starts tomorrow. I have no idea why this would affect the stoch though.  
Any ideas?

Hi  
  
This is still a problem it seems..different charts but same swap and time frame   
  
I have counted the 5min bars past the big down candle (12) and have placed my vertical line at the same point,as you can see it no way corrospondes to your chart.This we found was a major problem in Futures I thought in Forex it wouldn't be.  
  
This chart is from Alpari  
  
If we all use MT4 but with different brokers then we will have different results.I don't think we can post and compare the Ea's results on our charts ..more I think we need to look at did the EA pick out the right signal at the right time.  
  
It may well be that Monday I get a profit and you a loss..its not down to the EA but the data on our individual charts ,although the EA may still require work and I note you dont use the Dinap stoch any more  
  
Still on lmt time here sorry

Hi Paulus,  
I am not sure who you were referring to about not using the dinapoli, but it's on both David's and my charts. The RSI isn't on the charts, but his EA is still using the info from it he says.  
I guess I am not sure how to proceed from here. I guess when I am actually here and have time to manually trade the system I will try, and keep tabs on the EA as well to see if we can't fix the problems.  
The biggest issue that I can see at the moment is the stoch being so different for me, as compared to you guys. I have no idea why this would be. Hopefully we can figure it out.

Ok, I figured out why they are off... had me stumped for a while. Mine is on my interbank account, and they were down for a long time. So there are missing bars in mine. See that gap, there should be some bars in there, but they were down, and they were left out.

Is this signal valid and if so, why did the EA not take it?  
I did it manually, waited til bar closed, placed market order, set SL to the low of the signal bar, and TP to the top K line.  
  
Also, does my stoch look right now? I loaded a different one, and set it to 5/3/2 and close/close, not sure if it's correct.

Your chart looks better now. I am not sure why your other one didn't work right.  
  
  
It looks like it gapped up, so it didn't get in. You would need to put in a limit of -1 to get that trade. That is the only thing I can see.

David,  
Here is one that your EA did. See if it follows the rules you think it should. Losing trade.

I think that is a valid entry. What do you have your limit set at? It looks like 2, but I thought you said earlier you had it at 0?

Yeah, I changed it all to your default settings so we could see how it performs as is.  
I don't think it's very profitable as is, so hopefully we can tweak this as we go to increase it's win rate.  
Looking foward to paulus taking a look to see what changes we can make to have the EA follow how he trades more closely.

This strategy has really advanced, all the way to an EA. If I can ask, what is the current manual trading method for this keltner channel? Are there screens, and indy's to go along with it?

Made this strategy in EA is not so hard, but the problem is use fix parameter, don't you think that trade against a trend, like on EU is dangerous?beacause eu is a very trending market.  
But if u use a small stop this became a scalper sistem, i don't undertand where you put your stop?  
You say that the stop is below the candle where u open the trade, but this mean that u have a variable stop that depend of volatility but fix gain, this is true?

Yes, thanks Paulus,  
I agree with your questions and these are ones David will have to answer. I don't like how the EA is ending up trading normally, so hopefully we can get this tweaked and adjusted to trade the way it should. It is very consistent at the moment on how to trade a losing trade, hopefully we can turn it around.  
Hopefully David can take a look at this chart and example and shed some light on why it's taking so long to open the trade, seems to be the biggest problem at this time.

1\. Any news on the RSI? Are we still doing this? I got lost with the explanation, can somebody please explain how we're dealing with the false positives?  
  
2\. Paulus: Same problem as Expat with your system? Extremely slow market?

I think the answer to your question is the 2 pip spread. The stop should be 1 + spread (so price actually gets 1 pip below before you are stoped out). Or one other possibility is that I put in a variable for the minimum stop loss, so if the entry price is too close the the high,low of the signal bar, it with use a set stop loss. That is because some brokers have a minimum stop loss they will let you use. If you put in one too close, you will get an error for your order.  
  
Also, the price never got to the limit price until that down bar, it retraced 1 pip, but not two (at least that is what it looks like to me, and my best guess as to why that is when it entered).

Hey Paulus, How is everything? I hope your daughter is recovering good. And don't worry about us here. Take care of things at home, and we will be here when things settle down.

Hi Paulus,  
  
Just finished reading the thread from start to finish. whew! It sure is a good system. I'm just wondering though, (as someone asked also earlier though I guess you missed that post), if this was profitable in the Futures markets, what made you move over to forex?  
  
As I'm also trading the Futures (or at least trying to, lol), Do I understand correctly that the very first system you posted in the first page, is the very same system you used in futures? same timeframe? same settings?   
  
Thanks in advance Paulus for clarifying this for me. I hope your daughter is recovering well. She's in my prayers and so are you for your generousity in sharing your system.  
  
More pips!  
  
R

I just finished the thread as well. Two days, with all the charts to look at. Many thanks go to Paulus for all the efforts to date. It takes quite a committment of time to make all those posts, charts and replies. Hope all is well with you and yours.  
  
Also Jacioux helped crystalize a nebulous idea that was already floating around in my head as I was reading -- use of an IB candle instead of the RSI technique as a possible trend reversal signal. Ta mate. I already employ an IB setup on the 15M, and will try to marry these two by putting the 5 and 15 side by side. Slightly diff stoch settings, but we'll see. At the very minimum, it would seem to be an excellent entry confirmation to add to the warchest.  
  
Also I would second Peej's remarks on S/R (Hoss made reference too). PJ, your charts were well-presented. I appreciate the overall scalping aspect, but also believe its a good idea to at least be aware of the major S/R levels on the longer term charts. Which, on this time frame, IMHO, would generally be 15, 60 and 240. Put em on the same chart. Maybe start with the 240, mark em. Then change timeframe to 60 and repeat. Keep bringing them forward til you get to the 5m. Save to chart. And there they are, along with the 00's and 50's, waiting for price. Doesnt take that long and is worth it. If they bug you (I admit they bug me sometimes), fade them into the background color. Trend lines, trend channels, horizontal lines, fibs, pivots, whatever your pleasure. I am pretty sure biggie big bank is aware of them. I hope that is not speaking out of school.  
  
Thanks again to all involved.

Followup from message above regarding attempt to incorporate this method into 15M chart with IB/OB entry. Note times are EDT. Note also, my stoch setting is slightly different.  
  
First chart is EUR. Upon London open, price breaks above Asian high, then has a green candle close outside the K. Next bar is red, but I am waiting on an IB/OB which forms as the next candle (circled), but wrong color for Paulus' method. This is my signal so I establish entry price at low of IB, which hits the next candle. Stochs and ADX favorable, and you can also see SMA crossover. The clincher was the significant stoch divergence. Stop set at high of bar preceding IB (fucia lines).   
  
After enduring fairly long inverted hammer, take 1/2 at the 00 (which I verbal as the "uh-oo"). Move stop down. I had a TP below where it bottomed, so manually closed at the next IB marked by the arrow. That exit bar is also a Paulus setup with close below the K. And it would have worked had you set your stop at the low of the bar preceding the IB. I did not take that one but did take the one circled, occuring as NY got to work, but not a Paulus trade so wont discuss (in hindsight, i was too eager with this second entry. it worked, but still....)  
  
The second chart is the GBP from the same time period (these are the two pairs I watch). The signal candle here was an OB that formed after a K setup (circled). Entry was not until two candles later, long red one. Stop set at high of the OB (see fucia lines). Stochs, ADX and SMAs all confirmed + stoch divergence.   
  
Closed 1/2 at the 00s, and moved stop down on other half. Note the inverted (green) hammer around that time -- Paulus' RSI filter warned you off that as a possible entry (lower low). My target was 9840 based on S/R to the left but it did not hit so manually closed at next IB marked by arrow. Next entry (long) is shown too but did not fit the entry parameters here to warrant discussion.  
  
Anyway, this is a different style, not 5M scalping. But does tend to show, at least for today and these two pairs, Paulus' method has validity on a longer term chart as well. Both on entry, and use of the RSI to keep you out of a bad countertrend signal.  
  
So thanks again to Paulus for bringing this style over. By coincidence, I attended Traders Int'l as well around that same time. If you took the class in Austin, who knows, we may have been sitting beside one another! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

I have incorporated this system along 15min TF too plus other TFs, I have added CCI woodies and MACD, and look at the daily rythm indicated by CCI on 5 min and 15 min TF. I also use Delta with EW and Fibs, and try to trade only in the direction of Delta. I mostly trade G/U pair. I try not to take profits less then 20 pps, and allow the trade to run, in the direction of delta, monitorred on 5min, 15min, 1hr and 4hr TF. It was a challenging day today, I got several trades, the largest profit was 70+pps, and others around 30pps. I have left sdtill a lot on the table.  
happy trading

You need more identically calculated indicators on there, that will make fundamental principles of supply and demand even less relevant than you've already made them.

I took some of your strategy, and made my own. I trade mostly with bollinger bands instead of kelter, and 15 minute time frame... Im having such good results with it, Im thinking of making my own thread as there is no system quite like the one I use out there... well there are, but I got some custom alert indicators instead of the regular ones... rsi and stochs and Im wanting to get another alert indicator made... after a candle touches the outer bands, then I want the next candle that changes color on the close, to give me audio alert... Thats my buy/sell signal... if... rsi or stochs are also overbought/sold. Of course my system isn't traffic light clear as it does require discretion on entry and exit points.  
  
Anyways... It would be nice to see you post again  
  
Hope all is well with the family!

had a mail today about the K system  
  
Im going to try and set aside 30mins daily to try and solve some of the problems we had.  
  
I think its worth the investment it shows great promise and its fast and furious meaning if you only have 60mins a day to trade you are guaranteed 1/2 doz signals or so.  
  
Other systems ive been trading give fewer but perhaps more reliable signals I will post back any fixes if you want to communicate personally on this system just drop me an email  
  
cheers

Hi Paulus,  
The 5min Keltner is a good filter to get in and out of the market. I trade cycles which can be observed on different TFs. I have added CCI Woddies set on 34 on 5min, as an additional indicator, and compare it in terms of cycle with the 15min (CCI set on 14), H1( CCI multi set at 5,8,14 and 34) and H4(DiNapoli settings and CCI multi) TFs. I know this is not the way you have originally intended to use this system, but it has been working for me as a trigger filter. The gearing between different TFs is usefull while trading both ways in relation to the trend discerned on a H4 or Daily TF.  
Wishing you many good trades,  
2be

Late in here but I hope this gets a reply, this looks a standard indicator system and with NinjaTrader I've tried programming 100s of indicator combinations before finally accepting all indicators are moving averages and none of them will work consistently.  
  
That is unless you get your exits right. Paulus's knack seems to be cutting losses very short, so he gets the good trades and even when a strong trend knocks his Stochastic signals for six, he's out with tight losses. This is fundamental technique I really would like to master, I think I've got the stop loss rules sorted, but when I see the images here:  
<http://www.charthub.com/images/2008/04/17/System_1_4>  
  
I can't quite figure what the two number for each trade mean, eg. 0.3-0.3. Are you taking half profit and leaving half open somehow? Please could someone possibly let me know if how these numbers work and if there is any discretionary/mechanical multiple profit-taking,   
  
Thanks,  
Jeremy

Hi all,  
Looooong time lurker on FF over the years. Just wanted to know if anyone ( especially the Author ) still use this system, or variants of it?  
  
I think it has a lot of merit, particularly when used with confluent traditional T/A like S/R and fibs.  
  
I have noticed that in stronger trends it wouldn't be too good - but am playing around with ADX as a filter to stop me taking signals ( i.e. ADX above 20 and rising - be cautious, especially if there is no S/R around ).  
  
I'm also looking at something I can trade during Asian session, or possibly very late U.S. session. 

\- Look to the left, Trade to the right \- I am the system

Hi All,  
  
I do not trade it because it is the first news I have on it.  
  
I have read all the thread and I agree with one post that states that this system works on ranging markets. But if there is a trend, then the trades triggered are counter-trend, which increases risk (obvious).  
  
But considering that most of the time the market is ranging, then it is interesting to have this in mind.  
  
As soon as I get home I'll make some tests.  
  
Best Regards,  
  
gonso

Yesterday I made some backtest. The results were quite good:  
4 good  
3 breakeven  
0 bad  
  
The only thing is that I am very scared with countertrend trades.  
Any experience out there?  
  
Best Regards

hello gonso  
  
I'm looking at using this method and I believe I have found a way to substantially lower the risk involved in these "counter trend" trades. It goes as follows:  
  
I am looking at eurusd 5min tf on the 14th of this month, starting at the 1720 candle. During this trend upward we see several signals to short, none of which would have reached the initial TP level specified by the rules of this system(1720, 1845, and 1955 jump out at me as entry points). Finally at the 2025 is a signal to short where the TP level is reached before the stop.  
  
If you notice during this time PA never touches the bottom of the Keltner channel. The rule should be if you have a losing trade to ignore all signals in the same direction after that loosing trade until PA reaches the bottom(or top for long) of the Keltner channel, giving an indication that the recent trend is over.  
  
A more strict rule could be as follows: After a losing trade, the next trade MUST be the opposite order of the losing one.  
  
Applying these rules in the example above we would have a loser at 1720, then the next trade we would take would be at 2145(since PA touched the bottom band earlier). Applying the more strict rule would put a pass on the 2145 short but would take the 2215 long.  
  
Another thing to possibly look at is the angle the bands make. The angle is high(either + or -) during these trends. One could just pass on all trades until the angle is small, lets say within 15 degrees from 0. Let me know what you think.  
-Dan

I found myself missing many entries because I was simply doing other things. To show my appreciation for this thread I have modified the Keltner channel code to include a simple alert when either of 2 conditions are met: (1) price close > upper keltner AND stoch >= 80 (2) price close < lower keltner AND stoch <= 20

\--peej   
Can you add an email alert option to this indicator. I know that it has been awhile but I believe that the method can be refined. Just trying to cut down on some screen time. I have had luck using an entry buffer of 2pips. In other words, I enter 2pips above/below the close of the entry candle.

Hello all..Hope this thread is still active .  
  
Thanks Paulus for all your efforts .  
  
I have been trading this basic method ( only using stoch 15/3/2 and keltner ),  
  
for a month now and find it VERY dependable .  
  
I use it on a Renko chart , and the signals are clear . I enter when the stoch   
  
crosses the 20/80 . I have also discovered how to trade it in a trend .  
  
Has any one else used a renko chart with this ...an EA attempt would be   
  
interesting ..........Thanks

Hey Chappy......I am glad to hear about your success. We all need to compare notes. Can you post an illustrated screenshot? I will work on one and do the same. Maybe there is something that we can take away from each other. I was able to get an email alert added to the original indicator which saves me some screen time. I am able to get email alerts on my blackberry via my yahoo email account. What have folks come up with in the way of tips.....

I use the same indy's and template that Paulus shares in post #1 .  
  
However I install it on a renko chart , set to 3 or 5 .  
  
I view this method as a scalping set-up .  
  
As Paulus explained it can be used almost any time of the day for a few hrs   
  
to capture pips . Don't be greedy , take a few and wait for the next signal   
  
There will be many signals during a session and a choppy or range bound day   
  
is preferred .

This system seems to be working well when we have rangebound movement. I guess we could look at a currency strenght meter and pick a pair which is similarly strong at that moment.  
  
My setup with 5 pip boxes:

I saw 14 signals today in the first 6 hrs of london.  
  
Every one went for 10+ pips.....

Wow nice chappy.  
  
I see your set up is different to that of the original in this thread - why is that and how is it different?  
  
Also, has anyone else thought about using Bollinger bands instead?  
  
Thanks!

Well , the only real difference is that it is on a renko chart (3 box size ) ..  
  
I have the keltner set to 1.5 , but actually have only been using the stoch (15/3/2 ) for entry and exit .  
  
Put it on a renko chart and see what you think ..  
  
A renko setting of 5 will give fewer but more dependable signals .  
  
As Paulus has said a bollinger band doesn't work as well , as it expands and contracts .

This one works pretty well.  
  
You must install it on a 1 min chart and then open an offline chart to view the renko .

Thanks for fast reply. But it is not possible to add EA or drag and drop it to chart . So if EA is not added to chart it is also not possible to adjust box and M2 offline chart is not renko.

No , it is an indicator , not an EA ..  
  
Go to : My Computer/Drive C/Program Files/MT4/Experts/Indicators.....  
  
Drag & drop in indicators ..  
  
Close and re-open MT4 , and it will be under Insert/Indicators/Custom  
  
Then install it on a 1min chart and then open the offline chart

Your welcome ..  
  
Well , in a range day like yesterday . You can enter longs @ the 20 ,   
  
and shorts @ the 80 .  
  
However today is more of a trend day , so I have been looking for only shorts .  
And that is the tricky part of trading ,I like a macd to help see when a trend is   
  
starting .  
  
Remember this is a scalping set-up ,so if you take small bites until the   
  
direction is visible , you should be safe .

The template is the same that Paulus has posted in post #1.  
  
When you installed the renko on your 1 min chart , did you check the box   
  
"allow " dll imports (under common tab )?  
  
  
For exits Paulus recommends exiting at the opposits keltner line .  
  
I like to wait for the stoch to come back to the 80 or 20 .  
  
If it is real "whippy " I'll just take 5 or 10 and wait for another signal

The problem may be the renko EA - its 2.1.  
  
People generally say the first reliable version is 3.2. You can find it here on FF.

#1 was not a trade by the rules . I am trying to discover how to enter in a   
  
continuation .  
  
In this case the stoch did not drop below the 20 . This tells me that price is   
  
continuing up .  
  
I took this trade as a ross hook ,which also occurs at the same time that the   
  
stoch breaks the 80 ..

Hi Chappy  
  
I use MT Alpari which is 5 digits - do you configure the renko charts box size parameter to 30 (rather than 3) ?  
  
Thanks

Hey chappy I used to work with Renko charts a lot and I really liked them.   
It seems like the system you are using is a mechanical system can you please post the exact rules and I will write an EA and release it here.

Wow , That would be great if you could do it .  
  
I use the basc rules from Paulus's 1st post .  
  
long signal :  
  
1\. Wait for price to be outside keltner , and stoch below 20 .  
  
2\. Enter as stoch crosses up through 20 .  
  
3\. Exit as price touches opposite keltner . ( You could also hold until stoch  
  
goes up through the 80 and then exit as it comes back down through the   
  
80 , but this may be a bit much for an EA .)  
  
I also set the Keltner to 1.5 ATR  
  
Stoch : 15/3/2  
  
  
Paulus also moves the stop to BE at mid channel , I haven't been doing   
  
that . but might be a good idea for an EA .  
  
Hope this is clear enough ..Let me know if I can help ..  
  
Thanks Again .......

Hi Chappy  
  
Thanks for that - I think it is 50 pips for a 5 figure box.  
  
One quick question: is there a time lag on the charts (or do i have to manual refresh the screens ?  
  
I think if i was in live mode i would have to keep refreshing the screen  
  
do you have this issue ?  
  
thanks

Hmmm..no , I refresh once at start-up (to load the overnight data ) .   
  
Then the chart stays current all day . I have no lag , but I'm only running 1   
  
chart , 1 pair .

Hi, thanks for sharing this interesting system, i am playing around with renkos as well and trying to find something which suits my "arcade" style of trading as i dont have much time to sit in front of the PC  
  
1 question with regards to your entry if you dont mind, when the stoch crosses up through 20, must the price still be outside the keltner? many a times i am seeing that when this happens, the price is already at the middle of the keltner and its only 5-6 pips away from the other keltner end

Sorry , I think I confused you ,   
  
when the stoch crosses the 20 ( to go long ) , price has usually also crossed   
  
back into the keltner . The entry signal for me is when the stoch crosses the   
  
20 ,  
  
Paulus does it a little differently with candlesticks by taking the first long bar  
  
and not waiting for the stach to cross ..  
  
btw ,,today is a tough day for the method on the EU , as we are in a trend .  
  
This method works best in a sideways , rangebound day .

Chappy - thanks for the clarification  
yes i am getting slaughtered on EU right now (in demo) by using this method....trying to adjust the renko sizes to see if   
any makes a material difference.

the rules are simple. Do I wait for a **close** outside the channel or is it enough if the high of a candle breaks the channel.  
  
Same question on number 2 do we wait for a candle close to confirm the stochastic or is it enough if the current stochastic is above the 20

This might be a way to use the method in a trend .  
  
The stoch has failed to retrace from OS to OB ( or vice versa ) so when it   
  
comes back to the 20/80 , it signals a continuation entry ..  
  
( a bit confusing but gets clearer with screen time )  
.........................................................................................  
  
Kilian , I'm not sure how to answer that for coding purposes ..However   
  
for a sell signal ,when the price moves above the keltner ,it tells me   
  
"heads-up"--"get ready " . at that point i am focused on the stoch . and as   
  
it slants down towards the 80 , I will enter just as it crosses ..  
  
Lol ..I guess I am saying that No , I'm not waiting for a bar to close ..  
  
The action of the stoch is my main focus ..Hope that all makes some sense  
  
Having said that , Paulus uses a bar close entry and he may get in before I do .

If I look at the stochastic crosses it doesn't seem like this system is profitable.  
An indicator however just looks at the close price so if you enter early it might turn out better.  
  
This is just an indicator

Hi!  
  
I have an idea how to tading with success using keltner channel   
  
1/ TP should be 2 times higher than SL (eg. SL = 30% x distance between channels lines, TP = 60% x dist)  
2/ After SL, wait for opposite signal (eg. if sell signal closed by SL, EA wait only for buy signal)  
3/ Every trade with fixed risk (eg. 0,5 - 1 %)  
4/ Open trade some pips above lower line / below higher line (2-3 pips)  
  
Can anyone code the EA using this rules?  
I'll be grateful.

(The important thing which makes this EA profitable)  
  
5/ Add 1.5 lot multiplier after StopLoss  
1) Start with 0,2% risk  
2) 0,3%  
3) 0,4%  
4) 0,6%  
5) 0,9%  
6) 1,3%  
7) 1,9%  
8) 2,8%  
9) 4,2%  
10) 6,3%  
11) 6,3%  
12) Stop trading and move the EA to recycle bin

Well I have manualy bactested this method (the original one, not LeW's modification) and this is not a winning strategy in long run.  
There are days with haevy winning but then come day with like 3W/17L. The truth is, that winning trades are bigger then the losing ones, but it will not help make tis method a winning strategy. In the long run you will got none or really thin edge over the market.  
What I noticed is, that 5,3,2 stoch filter is not good at all, the best is the original 15,3,2 stoch, in combination with diNapoli even better. Using BE at middle white line is not good too.

I have been following up with KeltnerChannel indicator, it looks great and have a good result. However I have been looking for automated system EA for KeltnerChannel. Open close trades with TP and SL.  
Any help will be much appreciated.
