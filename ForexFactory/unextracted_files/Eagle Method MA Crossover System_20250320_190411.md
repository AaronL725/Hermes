Hi Guys.  
  
I've been trading for quite a while mainly news. But i have been working on an extremely simple but powerful trading system, based on Crossovers here it goes...  
  
Pairs  
Any.. but i use the GBP/JPY  
  
Time frame  
30min-1hr  
  
Indicators  
9 SMA on close  
100 SMA on close  
RVI = 100 (relative vigor index) same as Sidus' indicator. (THIS INDICATOR IS NOT NECESSARY I USE IT FOR MOMENTUM MAINLY)   
  
Method  
LONG - When the 9 crosses above the 100 SMA Buy and it helps if the RVI is above 0  
SHORT - When the 9 crosses below the 100 SMA Sell and it helps if the RVI is below 0  
  
(EXIT)  
Close your position and reverse it when the 9 crosses back or Close the position when the price crosses back over the 9 SMA by 20 pips.  
  
Money Management.  
I found an awesome Excel file that calculates your MM for you. I'll post it up today or tomorrow with a chart for the system.  
  
Additions  
You may generally have periods when the price may whipsaw 1 or 2 times in a row, but 80-90% of the time when the 9 crosses the 100 you will catch an awesome move.. I trade only the GBP/JPY on the 1 hour (1 to 2 trades a week)  
  
Let's get together and run this system to see how it goes. I have noticed on occasion you may miss pips waiting for it to cross back. So maybe we can implement a trailing stop. And let's look at an EA maybe.  
  
Also , NO fibs or pivots.. Not necessary for this method.

Even though it is essentially a crossover system.. The 9 - 100 is a large enough deviation to avoid Ranging and Whipsaws.. Just look at the 1 HOUR CHART on the GBP/JPY it will surprise you.

I've put your system into my mix, will see how it goes forward.   
  
How did you handle the March 13-15th sell signal?

Here is an image of the system in play. I prefer the 1 HOUR CHART. You don't even need the RVI, but i use it to confirm the momentum

Hey there.. Let me know how it goes.. Well i do have another exit i sometimes use. It can be discretionary.  
  
But as you can see I exited when the price retraced back ABOVE the 9 SMA.  
  
It is another way to exit. Or set 100 to 200 pip TP.

I think if we work together we can develop maybe 3 types of exits.. But let's keep it extremely simple.  
  
I think the only indicators that work are MA's and The price. And MA's only work well on 30min to weekly time frames. (in my opinion ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) )

You also need to consider and Manage your profts over a month and also expect a few losing trades. Because with this method. The large trades are MASSIVE and the loses aren't usually more than 50 pips. You most often will always end up in front by the end of the month.

Do you mean the entire candle closes above the 9SMA? In the chart the candle highs moved above the SMA 9 on the way down a few times....

Yes it needs to close above..  
  
This method of exit is discretionary..  
  
You could exit if the candle closes above the 9 SMA and has a 20-40 pip gap between the open and close of that candle.  
  
Does that make sense

I'll revise the exit options for you tonight in more detail.  
  
But this is the basic rundown i use.  
  
1\. Either exit on MA's crossing back  
2\. TP of 200  
3\. Exit when price retraces and closes above or below the 9 SMA.. and has at least 20 pips distance between the open and close.

So am I right that you are in a long trade on todays cross, I notice that the 9 crossing the 100 didnt happen until todays move was over. Even on the 30 you would have missed all of todays move.

Hi,   
  
Great simple system...i dont even think u need the 9sma hehe...  
  
Anyway you might need a faster exit....21close and 34open tunnel should do the job.

Thanks mate... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
I still think we should work together to refine the exit. The entry is almost perfect..  
  
I think if you just let it reverse the position on the cross, you will still end up in profit at the end of the month, cause the big moves are massive.. And the MA's filter out the small whipsaws by default.  
  
The goal is to try and get it to a Mechanical Level so we can implement and EA.

weel one things for sure...there i no perfect system...this one will fail on choppy days. But for whats worth, we want to make it a winning one. like you said there are a few ways to make the exit better. I have a few ideas.   
  
\- 1 use 21sma Open and Close tunnel. This was once used by twoblink on 55ema open close tunnel i think it works well. TP on tunnel cross.   
  
\- Incremental tp, 50, 70, 100 followed by trail. This will be discretional.   
  
I would not tweak too much from there on. You already have something good going here.

Yeah you do miss some moves on the 1 hour.. But that will always happen.  
  
If you want to catch all of them you can use the 30 min chart.  
  
As you can see it had a false SELL then a nice buy

You need the 9sma to filter out most false signals

Nice idea Jest.. I'll look into it.. The Wide SMA's do generally protect you from choppiness.. But I think we can look at the implementing a more sound exit..

That's great go for it.. I think if people stick to this simple system and apply sound money management, you will make money.

Guys.. This is another example of how this system catches MASSIVE moves.   
  
In jan here was a huge one.. You get generally one a month...  
  
900 pips in 8 days..   
  
Outside of these moves you catch 100 - 200 pip moves and a couple of 50-60 pip losses..   
  
If a few people start trading it. even with an crossover EA. We can really tell the might of this method.

Hi tbwss1234 and thanks for sharing.  
  
Are you using any s/l? Obviously, you are not using any t/p, but I'm curious as to the s/l points.

Hi there.. No i don't use a Stop loss at all.. It is more of stop and reverse. So when the MA crosses back it closes and reverses the trade.

Also. remember we are always going to encounter loses (the less the better obviously and I think this system gives you around an 85% or more success rate on entry).. So the focus is to determine the absolute best way to grab these moves..

I know he's a busy man, but this method would be worth a little of Mikhaildgreat's time. We just need a couple of evolutionary steps in developing the exit strategy - and then this ought to be a nice pip generator.

I'll try uploading it again.. It's more of a profit management plan. Helps you allocate lots sizes based on % risk per trade.  
If this doesn't work I can upload a link to for you guys

Hi Brentmack.. Possibly.. I want to try an make the exit more mechanical first.. At the moment I exit based on my profit within the week and a few discretionary descisions.

Here is an example of the power of using the RVI indicator to filter out ranging/Choppy markets..  
  
Two no trades then one sell for i think 200 pips profit in the end.  
  
So the RVI mostly protects you but on a rare occasion the RVI may cause you to enter late. But it can be worth it.

BUT also notice you could have still made some pips from the two false signals...

30 min charts seem to be the most profitable for the gbp/jpy but you can use 1 hour and up

Fx freak.. My results won't help you.. I'm posting this method up for you guys to paper trade and see for yourself.. It has discretionary aspects to it so results will vary from trader to trader.. The best way to determine how good it is, would be to paper trading it for 2 weeks..

On my chart you should have been long since 15th of mars and it's up approx 500 pips. Collecting a handsome amount of swap. This is on GBP/JPY.   
  
I have problems to see how that would be bad?   
  
Are you telling me that you usually get more pips in 9 days?  
  
If so I would be happy to hear about how.

Also time of day plays an important role.. From what i have seen most ranging happens during the Asian Session.. So during asia i prefer to use the 1 hour time frame and london and US i use the 30 min

I don't always follow the RVI religiously.. In this instance i have entered the Short as I know that the GBP/JPY is seriously over bought.

The RVI will give you a confirmation of momentum.. So when it is below Zero It means we are most probably in for a solid move.  
  
I usually take all of the crosses then watch the RVI and make sure it heads past the Zero.. If it doesn't then i may implement a TP or Even close the position.  
  
Remember your success will come, when you learn to surf the market like a wave.. and work out the patterns that make that wave worth riding.   
  
I suggest entering all the crossovers then using discretionary factors to determine when to exit.

tbwss1234,  
  
Like I said before, your system supplement my 4HR system. My system gave me a good signal around 2:30 PM (Pacific time) and looking at your 1HR system it showed me a crossover but I waited a little time. Placing stop order entry Sell GBP/JPY at 231.28. Got filled and clossed at 230.22 (after price touched and bounced the 55 SMA at 4HR chart). I might place another sell order depending on how the price move around the 55 SMA at 4HR chart.  
  
Thanks again, with your system I can place better entry.  
  
Regards,  
Rick

tbwss1234,  
  
This is just my observation. I noticed a high probability trades when Moving averages crosses and the RVI crosses zero line.  
  
Check it out,

The problem here is that you need a solid exit method. If you dont have a solid exit method backtesting this is useless.   
  
Exiting when the ma crosses back over will totaly kill you in a range bound market. Take a look at eg june last year.  
  
So the problem will be, when to take a few pips, and when to let it ride. The fact that it works awsomely well now, does not mean it wont kill your account as soon as you have a ranging market.

The RVI's and MA's protect your entry when the market is rangebound.. And that's why this thread has been set up to define a good exit.. You can still profit from whipsaws if you have a solid exit strategy..  
  
Maybe a trailing stop may work.. Guys we need to consolidate our brains and work on this..  
  
And regarding backtesting.. I don't think you can ever apply it to any real system.. Because it's pretty much a known fact by pro traders that a purely mechanical system won't work for exits ever.. It takes the trader as the individual to watch the market move and determine his moves based on price activity  
  
We have a system here that will give you awesome entries.. Again, let's get together and work out the best exit, even if it means expressing some key points on how to observe the price...

Thanks for your input...  
  
Also you can exit by  
1\. The price crossing back over the 9 sma by 30 pips..  
2\. The 9sma crossing back over on a smaller time frame like the 5-15min chart.  
3\. A TP of 100pips

well for the exit i am waiting for the TVI to cross the zero line   
i have my own method for exit which i dont know how to explain but overall this metho dis very nice for me for long term or for scalping if u r not greedy then u need to know how to make pips   
i think 20 30 pips with 10 us$ each pip is too enough for one day trading for traders like me   
  
so overall its good system   
  
thanks

How is the RVI supose to protect me in ranging market? Not trying to just post critics here, just curious. If most of the whiping can be filtered, then this is a killer way of trading.

Hey there.. And your comments are justified and important as it keeps momentum going in this thread.. And criticism is great so keep up the quesiotns ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) .  
  
Generally when the market is ranging.. and you get a buy signal.. The RVI won't be above zero.. This happens most of the time in a ranging market.. And if you notice the 9 SMA and 100SMA is a filter based on their distance between eachother alone.. If you look back you can still make 20 - 50 pips when during whippy times.. So what we need to do is aim to develop sound money management.  
  
so within the month if you grab a large move.. then aim for smaller moves for the rest of the month..  
  
with 100 pips a week you have the potential to turn 1000k into 100 000 in a short time..   
  
And without stops you can avoid a lot of stop hunting done by the retail brokers.  
  
If you look back their is an EXCEL file called trading plan.. It is great for showing how you can grow your account..

how bout exits in this way:   
  
example:   
1\. 30min SELL trade signal (this is our first trade) then,  
2\. 5min there is 9sma&100sma crossup, we can exit the trade.  
3\. if 5min we get 9/100 crossdown, we SELL again.  
4\. if 5min we get 9/100 crossup, we exit SELL, next if 15min also we get crossup, then we wait for 15min crossdown to re-enter SELL trade (avoid 5min crossdown as it will come before 15min crossdown)  
  
5\. this way we dont have to wait for 9/100crossup on 30min chart to exit position, and we could save some pips.  
  
PS: for 5min and 15min chart same setup as 30min chart and same rules for entries

Yeah, but I also see that you have to potential to loose a couple of hundred pips before you make any profitt. And the exel file use an insane risk model. 30% in the beginning? Thats two really bad trades, and your account is pretty much history!  
  
If you look at this years performanse, then the RVI would kept you out of a lot of the really awesome trades. If you remove the RVI, then your account is going to get KILLED in the choppy markets. Look at eg june.  
  
  
And as a sidenote: if you have nothing else to say than "read the thread and you will understand" then it's better to keep the mouth shut.

I use this TSR indicator that I got from another thread.   
  
I've noticed that when it crosses the 9sma it's a good entry/exit signal when taken into account with the other signals. Hope it can help

Good job Nybegynner on the testing, and i agree some of the months last year lots of whipsaws. But do you have any suggestions to improve this strategy which the author has been askin for right from beginning ?

Here is a chart of 8th FEB, SELL traded loss of 100pips (whipsaw) if profits not locked or improper stops prior to CrossUP on 30min chart.  
  
But i checked it again as per the exit rules i mentioned in previous post, loss on the same signal would have been less then 20pips ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1).  
  
1\. CrossDOWN on 30min chart SELL @ 237.13  
2\. CrossUP on 5min chart , so we Exit SELL @ 237.20  
3\. CrossUP on 15min chart  
3\. CrossDown on 15min chart, so re-entry SELL @ 236.62  
4\. CrossUP on 5min chart so Exit SELL @ 236.73

yes i used one of the ma cross ea to backtest it. last year results not as good as last three months results, cos of whipsaws. But again as the exit is not defined i relied on trailing stop, and it didnt ride big waves till the end.

This kind of MA based solution works nicely in a trending market - and FX is the trendingest (a real word?) market there is. The difficulty is detecting a ranging market. Ranging is only recognized as it clips you. Then you can build a strategy for taking adavantage of it. Box Plays come to mind.  
  
RVI is a help - I would suggest going back and applying some basic Technical Analysis on price action to help detirmine entry and exit points. Pivots would be a help too. Daily, Weekly and Monthly. Confluence of S/R lines are like solid walls very often and indicate a great exit point.  
  
Plain old indicators gets you part way there.  
  
Multi Timeframes is likewise an excellent thing to observe. I personally like to trade *with* the larger trend as it results in higher probability trades. MA's, Stoch's, MACD, etc - pick your poison.  
  
In all - you'll never catch every trade. You'll never win every one. You can learn to recognize one that is not working out. Discipline will enable you to get out of it before you get completely smashed.  
  
Last thought - I really like scaling into a trade. Start with a toe in the water, and then scale in as it goes your way. Scale out as milestones are hit - pivots or touching a previous swing high/low for example. In this way, our pain is minimized in a bad trade, and you are consistently ringing the cash register on the way up.  
  
Anyone notice that this kind of trading works kind of nice on a daily chart too? After a nice trend, I see that we tend to see a period of consolidation. Either play this as a box play or find a different instrument. Something is always on the move. 

I'm pretty much done with all this ...

TBWSS,  
  
I like to play with ma crosses on GBP/JPY to get some nice trend runs. I am attaching a description of what I would do with your crosses to define your exit and reduce the whip. It is a pretty big departure from your simple cross, which is why I'm attaching it rather than adding it to your thread.   
  
i'll delete it if you want.  
  
I hope the description is good enough, but I can answer any questions if not.

How do you create this channel? Is this a standard indicator within Metatrader and you just change the settings to your method or is this programmed code? It looks to be a good solution to preserving some hard earned pips. By the way I have about 200+ pips profit on this current crossover. Thanks for the method

This cross combination was obviously very powerfull. All thanks to tbwss1234 for picking it out and sharing it.  
  
I have not forward tested or backtested but after reading the modification that str8deals shared I believe we may be close to the goal of this thread!!!!  
  
  
Thanks for all of your help!!!!

Str8,  
I've been F12ving through the years checking out the way Price interactes with the Channels you suggested.   
  
If you only trade crosses where price exceeded the channel on the previous move it does indeed avoid the Whip.   
  
Although extreem there only appears to be a couple periods of Whip with this MA Combination and they seem to happen in groups. (Maybe once or twice a year)   
  
Would it make sense to take all crosses regardles of price exceeding the Channel until a loss? After the first Loss wait for Price to exceed the Channel for a "Perfect Setup". (Similar to 4hour tunnel and Vegas rules)  
  
Looking at several months of data, several profitable trades whould have been missed waiting for the "Perfect Setup".   
  
I'll try to do a manual Backtest of 2 years to see what the numbers look like.  
  
Either way I'm really excited about this system and the additions you have provided.  
  
Joe

All of what you are saying is oh so wonderful.. But as a beginner you need to understand that any trading system is discretionary.. So for example if sometimes you FEEL like the RVI isn't necessary don't use it. And when you understand the patterns of the market you will be able to see DURING ASIA that it is ranging etc..  
  
Haha and mate, look at the EXCEL sheet properly you set you own risk model.. It can be 1% or 100%... read it properly..   
  
NO system is going to win 100% of the time.. And their is no such thing as MECHANICAL.. You need to apply your own decisions.. SO if you see a market ranging get out..  
  
And as i said when it is whipsawing make smaller profits..   
  
So i suggest either you start paper trading this system and seeing how powerful it is, and using your DISCRETION to exit.. Or try something else..  
  
And you don't have the potential to lose a couple of hundred pips. That's sounds like your not looking at this method properly. This system will protect you.  
  
So enough said, guys let's get back to improving the exit.. This thread needs to progress

Your idea is great for the 5 Min exit.. Let's keep trying it and see how it goes..   
  
Cause if you look at the crosses their is still protential for profit.. You usually get 1-2 big moves and 15 small moves a month

Thanks for your input..  
  
I have traded a for a while.. And ranging markets are very easy to detect.. Not from indicators but from you watching the market..  
  
It goes like this.  
  
ASIA. in the first hour of activity it will either create a range of trend.. If it ranges Europe will break out and so on.. It always happens this way..  
  
I like the previous suggestion about implementing time frames.. As this cross method gives you profit on EVERY single trade just depends on how much..  
  
SR and other technicals can work well when using it for scalping.. When you catch a big move, just focus on the simplicity of the MA's and the market.  
  
I've met quite a few pro traders in my time and you would be shocked to know how simple their methods are.. It's all about UNDERSTANDING the patterns of the price activity

Great idea.. Let's look into this..  
  
SO guys we have 2 fantastic ideas form guys in this forum..  
  
1\. Using this channel method to exit  
2\. Using 30 min to enter and 5min cross to exit and 15 min to re-enter..  
  
Now let's start trading it and see the results..

Ok, so you dont have any solid rules for knowing when to stay in the market or not. If you dont see how you would have lost a buch of pips with the exit you sugested, then you better backtest again.   
  
"the system protects you" is true only to a certian degree, cause the RVI as you use it will keep you out of quite a few of the good trades as well (like yesterday's sell) so if you don't have any rules for when to use it or not, then you might as well just skip it. In fact you dont even have a system yet, just a framework to build a sytem on. Sure you can trade mechanical, just not with the 1000+% a year that most of the people in here dream about.  
  
I have backtested this system with stocks, histstepstock, rvi, rsi today, and nothing of it will tell you not to enter and get whiped. You can reduce the whipping with 40/50% though. I actually found HistStepStock to be a better filter than RVI.  
  
Most people in here dont realise that if they make 100% in a year, that is VERY good ROI.

100% a year is a brutal/amazing/super/great/wonderfull ROI and any REAL trader would love that! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Yes it is, 100% a year is world class! If you had 100% a year on average then you would not have any trouble to get work at huge hedge funds.

One other suggestion on entry:  
  
For Long Entry:  
  
1) 9 Ma crosses 100 (Original condition)  
  
AND   
  
2) Order is placed few pips above the high of the first candle that actually closed above the 100 sma  
  
This way you can even place an entry order in advance.  
  
  
The reverse applies for Short entry.  
  
This can reduce the whipsaws to a great extent.

NYbegynner it's good to see you are looking at other filters..  
  
Take a look at some of the suggestions.. I wouldn't focus on filtering entry so much as determining an exit strategy. The channel exit looks great and also the timeframe method.  
  
NO SYSTEM WILL WORK WITHOUT YOU WATCHING THE MARKET!  
  
And again GUYS instead of focusing on backtesting.. You need to paper trade and develop strategies based on that.. NO PRO trader backtests... It is a waste of time.. Seriously  
  
AGAIN.. Just know that this CROSS gives you a great entry, so let's PLEASE focus only on   
  
1\. EXIT FOR TREND  
2\. EXIT FOR RANGING MARKETS  
3\. Money Management.  
  
Hopefully this will clear things up and allow us to progress  
  
And hah of course it isn't a finished system yet.. Thats why it is in this thread..   
  
AND guys i believe with the CHANNEL EXIT and TIMEFRAME EXIT we could be onto something.. EVEN WITHOUT THE RVI

Also, the 9 and 100 SMA will filter small whipsaws.. Larger whipsaws are great for small profit takng..  
  
The Channel method looks great for filtering exits.  
  
I am going to work on a word DOC this weekend

You're speaking to the man who started this thread. I don't believe you'd want to run a poll on who should keep their mouth shut, would you?  
  
Some of us earned over 200 pips in the last 12 hours. Did you get your share? And if not, why not?  
  
Each of us is interested in earning and KEEPING as many pips as possible. Your input toward that goal is welcome. Being disagreeable in a disrespectful manner isn't - particularly when it's directed at the originator of this thread.

You miss the point.. Discretion meaning to make human decisions based on the the system you have in place.. No system is 100% mechanical..  
  
Watching price bouncing of SR lines and trading is discretionary.. Entering carry trades based on news speculation is discretionary..  
  
Of course you need to have the system running brilliantly but it will be your discretion as an individual that will determine your profit..  
  
Anyway.. This is getting annoying.. STOP posting unless it is productively related to this system.. Save your debates for some where else..

Guys what we can look at doing is..  
  
1\. Maybe when you enter the cross.. Exit positions at the 125 CHANNEL..   
2\. Then if it still wants to go down.. Cut down to smaller timeframes..  
  
So implement both suggestions and we could be onto a real winner here

No I didn't with that remark. Maybe run a pol about who's able to read?

Back test it and you will find out.   
  
Looks best on GBP/JPY though. Volatile and with sweet long trends when they kick in.

i would only recommend this idea for the GBP/JPY because you will gain massive moves that will also keep you in profit.. And I have only been trading it will this pair and haven't lost a month yet.. It's been 6 months worth of trading.  
  
If you trade every cross by the end of each month you are in profit.. using the GBP/JPY on a 30 min or 1 hour chart..

At the end of the day, it's all about risk tolerance.  
  
To me, I would rather have fewer losing trades, and end up missing some of the moves, than to keep trading until I hit a loss. It's actually kind of empowering to be on the sidelines during a big move that didn't fit your rules. It means you did the right thing.  
  
There will always be another trade/trend. You're never going to hit all the good ones, but why not just take the higher probability setups? 

Follow my advice at your own peril....

Yes, GBP/JPY is the greyhound of currency pairs. It moves!  
  
But perhaps tbwss is being too modest. A quick look at NZD/USD - which trends nicely and pays more per pip - indicates that you might want to keep an eye on that pair in your spare time and pick up a little spare change.   
  
That way you've got a second option and it's not correlated to either the pound or the yen.

If you want to apply a channel to the GBP/USD  
  
Set it to 55

SELL trade of 27March. and exit of 5min setup.  
  
Thick red line entry, and thin red line exit of 5min.

Hi, I have a suggestion for exit.   
I tried adding CCI 14. How it works?  
  
Firstly,   
  
During entry,make sure when MA9 crosses MA100,   
  
**Long, CCI is above 0  
Short, CCI is below zero**  
  
THEN,  
  
**EXIT, wait for CCI goes back to 0...**  
  
my english sucks so plz see the picture for a clearer view thanx.  
  
Do you think adding SHI channel will do any good?For example if a cross happens(LONG) near the top of the channel, it can make a u turn...**Correct me if I'm wrong**

I completey understand your point. It was just my observation that the Whipsaw was so infrequent that you may be missing more positive trades by waiting for the "Price exceeding Channel" setup before a Whipsaw condition is identifed. I'm going to only trade perfect setups until I have enough data to detemine the most profitable solution.   
  
Thanks for sharing your experiance and insite.

I have been trying something using a 4hr charts for a bunch of reasons - I don't want to hang around and watch the screen all night, I want to eliminate the whips, I think longer term is more stable and profitable, etc... so in playing with the set ups I found something interesting in regards to the exits (which is the problem we are out to solve, yes?). Well check this out:  
  
If you set the period in the RVI to 1 on a 4hr chart something interesting happens. If you enter at a cross and stay in until the RVI line crosses 0 in the opposite direction and exit (not reverse, just exit and chill) and wait until it either crosses back (trend resumes) or it leads to a MA cross (reverse) you eliminate much loss of pipage.  
  
There is for sure discretion involved in this (as we have established there is in everything) and I am just starting to test it but it was too cool not share.  
  
check it out for yourself.

I don't know how to paste a screen shot but here is how you change the RVI to 1:  
  
assuming you already have the indicator attached just right click on it and select: INDICATOR LIST. Then highlight the RVI indicator and select EDIT. Then in the parameters tab simple change the period from 10 (or whatever it is) to 1 and select OK.  
  
that's it.

One of the best filters you can use in trading this method and many others is "to wait". When the ma's cross simply wait and watch how price reacts, then make your decision. Using waiting as a filter you will miss some of the move but your emotions will be minimized. For example when the ma's cross let price take off and then it will bounce/pullback, sometimes a little and sometimes alot, when it does that take a look at the highest high for buys and lowest lows for sells and put in a pending order 10-50 pips away from those price areas. With a pending order ie. buy stops and sell stops you are choosing the General direction of the trade but at the end of the day you are allowing price to choose the Specific direction when price moves and opens your position for you.

fritz,  
I agree with your method. I also believe that the price action creates a pattern I like to place my order entry (10 pips away). And when I got fillled, I manage my trade by moving my stop loss until the price kicks me out. Check my pictures.

Rick

Great to see you guys are thinking about the system and personalizing your own method. Trailing stops and order stops can definately work...

When it does give us a perfect signal.. It most probably will give us a nice run.. But i most often enter all crosses..   
  
I watch the signals that weren't a perfect set up, just in case it reverses.. And let the perfect set up run.  
  
I also am trialing moving a stop to Break even at 50 pips

I tend to use the 30 min for the GBP/JPY you get much earlier entries.. others i use the 1 hour  
  
I'm currently using the 125 pip channel.. SO to exit i now either..  
  
1\. Exit when the 5min 9SMA crosses back..  
2\. or exit if the price bounces off the 125 pip line then reneter if it retraces back and breaks.

Hi that's great to see.. Add the 125 pip channel and move back to the 30 min chart... Just watch to see it breaks the channel..

Ok switch to the 30 min chart  
  
Click on the 100SMA and then go to LEVELS  
  
Add 125  
Add -125  
  
That's it ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

On the guppy, I've been watching for the 9/100 SMA cross on the 15M chart, wait for confirmation of a cross on the 30M, and enter on the open of the next candle. My last entry was at 230.73 on the 12:00 GMT candle, and I closed at 231.73 for +100 pips. I'm considering using a large trail of 50 pips, setting BE at 50, or scaling out at either fibs or set targets (ex. 25, 50, 75, etc).   
  
The entry seems to be the easy part...finding the optimum exit might take a bit (which is true for all methods, right ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Great to see you are making some pips..  
  
When you enter the trade.. Try looking at the smaller timeframes to exit...  
  
So when the 9 crosses back over the 100SMA in the 15 min or 5min exit the position.. And re-enter if it crosses back down  
  
or  
  
I am also looking at the 125 -125 pip channel posting in this thread.. as an initial exit.. If it bounces at that point i exit and wait for it to break past.. then re-enter.

Is it normal to see the gbp/jpy to whip lash 120 pips just after it moved across the 100 sma on the 1H

Will this system work with eur/jpy...If so that would be great because of the lower spread.

GBP/JPY has a buy signal at 1H chart 231.46 so if we switch to 30m to get the 125 channel so we get target about 231.70 to exit, so we just get 24 pips?

The channel method was never meant for anything other than a 1 hr timeframe. The channel size is very specific  
  
On the 1 hr timeframe, your tp should be 232.45 for the first lot and let the second lot run

It can be used on the Eur/JPY  
  
The channel levels are +-100

Hi str8deals thanks for you fantastic suggestion..  
  
I have implemented it and am using it.. It has been working on the 30 min as well for the GBP/JPY...  
  
What i am doing now is  
  
1\. ENTER ON CROSS  
2\. CHECK RVI if it's past zero then it will be a nice move and i can let it run.. If it isn't past ZERO then i watch the trade carefully  
3\. I wait for the price to hit the outer channel (125) then I move to the 5 min TF.. If it retraces by 30 pips i exit the trade.. If it passes the channel i then...  
4\. Hold the position and implement a 50 pip trailing stop..

Hi all,  
  
I'm a total novice at this game but this system seems so simple I am tempted to try it but there are things I don't understand. I'm using a free chart setup I found on the net that offers the standard indicators but in the opening entry on this thread TBWSS says the indicators are 9SMA on close and 100SMA on close. Can somebody explain the 'on close' bit to me please ? Apologies in advance if this seems a really stupid question.  
  
Cheers

Hi,  
When you want to draw an MA on the chart, you have to chose the period, the "MA method" (Exponential, simple etc) and the "Apply to" tab.  
  
In our case, you have to chose "Apply to: close".  
  
Hope this helps

Hi,   
  
Thanks for that. I've just checked my setup and under the moving averages title it allows me to choose whichever one I want and then places it on the chart so I'm not sure whether the effect is exactly the same as you describe but thanks a lot anyhow.  
  
Cheers

Have you noticed how a bounce off of the 100 sma can also be a great entry point or scalping method.  
  
Any thoughts.

Today I got whipsawed on the entrance on the 1h cross ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1) it was a bad day for gbp jpy and a great day for gbp usd. Man, gbp usd doesnt move much lately, but when it does...I think gbpjpy got stuck between gbp usd goin up and usd jpy going down, so this may be the cause for the shitty ugly spikes.   
  
It seems however that the entrance on the cross on 30 min chart would have worked much better. Next time ill do it.

I was backtesting this using the straight cross of the 9 over the 100 and in trying to figure an exit method that would not lose as many pips as simply waiting for a re-cross, and therefore a reversal, I applied fractals and used them as a trailing stop. It was pretty successful. I also found that not applying a stop initially was the best method to get the trade going, however, I could not trade this way live. So I would have to figure some emergency stop loss number to apply initailly in the trade.

Try just adding a 21 ema and taking the cross for the exit. A shorter EMA might work better but the 21 is pretty good.

here is a idea for a better exit. It will vary a little from broker to broker but should be close enough.  
  
Draw trend lines as the run is moving keep updating the trend lines. when price breaks or closes (closes) the trend line exit the trade. It could also give you a heads up on the next entry. but I would move stop to be on the trendline break as soon as possible. there is some discretion to it.  
  
do some backtesting this weekend while moving one cadle at a time.  
  
Mouteki method has some great lessons on drawing trend lines.   
  
Its as simple as this method and seeems to work well with it for exits.  
  
Youll never get every pip, just like youll always have loosing trades.  
  
here is the recent chart with a few lines on it. You can see how it would get you out long before a cross happens. Most of the time you have a trendline in place before the cross that gets you into a trade. this could also help with, getting out early on whips?  
  
Needs some backtest but I think you can see it can work and it simple.

I got into the gbp/jpy yesterday afternoon...1 minute I was up 28 pips with a 50 pip stop loss...then I saw it going down on some news so I got rid of the stop loss and let it ride down.   
  
It went down 120 pips then hovered around the 50 pip in the minus for me...then this morning it was all over the place and I got out with 9 pip profit (real money) just before the close of the day....I didn't want to be in over the weekend and see a big spike to the down side on the open on sunday.  
  
But great system.....I think I will be able to make some money out of this one.  
  
Have a great weekend.

Good for you Billser for getting out of that one positive. Backtesting this shows it will hurt bad during a ranging market, as we all know ma cross systems do. It will reward nicely though in a trend, again this is not news to most of us. I don't think this is any better or any worse than other ma crossover systems. Money management will save you with it. If you can weather the range periods then you should make money in capturing the trends.

What I noticed today was on certain time frames it would keep bouncing off of the 100 sma. When I learn the mood of the pair I will also learn to trade this price action to take a 10 - 20 pip scalp off the 100 sma.   
  
Happy weekend and Happy Pippin'

Entry strategy looks very solid but, I have a strong feeling that you will need to implement some type of stop loss with this strategy as a security net. You can never monitor the market 24 hours a day, and you never know when the markets jumps out and goes against you. Other than that, the strategy looks very good.

Well Ive bee trying to nail down the exit strat by using trendlines and I found that I would end up exiting early most of the time. perhaps I just need more practice with trendlines. There is a indicator out there that will draw the latest trendlines for you. Demark_trend_alert_and_mail it will alert you when price crosses the lines. Im not on my home ccomputor or I would atach it.  
  
I also added a 05 and -.05 level to the RVI set to 100 period, and found that once the RVI is past those levels and crosses back that is a good time to exit the trade. I would like some of you to test this also and see what you think of it for a exit strat.The 125 channels work great and if price has been outside of them and comes back in it is at least a warning that things are cooling down, but the RVI tells even more. I had never used the RVI before but like it much better then other oscillators.  
  
I also tried a old idea that I was thaught by Rob Booker. We all know the trend is our friend but determining the trend is what we struggle with. Rob used the 62 to tell him the trend in his 5/13/62 method. The Idea is to use a higher ma, which is in turn using a higher time frame to show the trend.  
  
I decided to try putting a 200 ma on the chart and which ever side of the 200 the 100 is on thats the safest direction to trade. So if the 100 is below the 200 you take short trades. this will keep you out of most of the whips. Even when the 100 is flat if the 200 is coming down you sill would look for short trades. when both 200 and 100 are flat and close to eacch other its time to be careful or look for another pair to trade. Im also checking it with the 144sma but so far like the 200 best.  
  
I also added a P-sar and noticed that when the dots change your safe to get out and when it goes back in your diretion your safe to get back in, as long as the 9 has not crossed the 100. However it will change back and forthe several times in a good run.  
  
BTW this seems to work on all TFs also. Remembe it will work on other pairs so it things flatten out try check another pair for a while. Hope this helps.  
  
I would like a indicator to tell me the distance between two MAs and if they are moving closer or farther apart. Is there anything like that out there?  
  
Thanks tbwss1234 I really like this system!

This is your 1st chart in this thread  
  
You say close & reverse when the 9 & 100 cross the 2nd time on the chart  
But Why would you reverse here?  
I understand why you stoped here  
But don't your rules say to wait untill  
the RVI climbs over the 50% to get back in ?![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f615.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/2753.png?v=15.1)

Hi there  
  
Could you learned people assist a total novice. I've been watching this thread with great interest but I'm using a free chart setup I found on the net and it has nothing called an RVI indicator. It does have something called a momentum indicator - would this be the same thing ? If it isn't could I use stochastics instead ?  
  
Grateful for any help  
  
Cheers

This along the lines of what I`m thinking.  
  
First enter with 2 positions as the 9 MA crosses the 100 MA.  
  
Exit one position when the 9 MA crosses the 20 MA opposite to the trend. (or 21 in your case)  
  
Re-enter anytime the 9 crosses the 20 going WITH the overall position.  
  
Exit first (overall) position only when the 9 re crosses the 100 line.  
  
  
This way your sealing in some profits everytime the 9 crosses the 20 but you keep one position in for the entire move.  
  
The second position is more like a long term scalping move but insures you keep more profit if the bigger move goes against you for a smaller profit.  
  
Haven`t tested it out yet but I`ll try it tomorrow.  
  
First post on this forum but I love this method so far. Looks like easy money ! (easier the better IMO)

It does have something called a momentum indicator - would this be the same thing ? If it isn't could I use stochastics instead ?

Hi,  
  
As far as exits, I've been using the 21SMA and it is working good. I reenter if price again goes above the 21SMA and the RVI is above 0.  
  
I've also put the HA Mod on the chart. It also helps get you in a little sooner.

i've read the thread from begining to end but can't seem to find the basis for choosing the 9 and 100 as ma values...  
  
ma systems are my favorites but the 9/100 combination seems unusual...... anyone know of the reason for those 2...... thanks......h

The rationale was that this combination minimized the whipsaw effect. It was mentioned at least once, but perhaps not prominently.

hi tbwss1234,thanks for sharing and constantly updating your system,but i do have some questions,  
1.do u actually enter the trade when the MAs cross or when the price touches the 100SMA and about to cross it?   
2.i guess u have been trading live using this system for some time now,hows the success rates?  
3.can this system be used for new trading? thanks![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

Hi there. Just like to say this is fantastic that minds are coming together to evolve this system, we've had some great suggestions..  
  
Here is something i have been doing to try and determine exits and it looks promising.  
  
ADD the 125 pip trend lines as per previous post.  
ADD 65 pip trend lines  
BOTH to the 100 SMA  
  
And on the 9SMA   
ADD 45 pip and - 45 pip lines to it.  
  
I exit when the 45 pip channel line crosses back over the 100 SMA.

So now we waitin 45pip channel line to crossdown with 100SMA to exit our buy trade ?  
  
how to use 65pip channel of 100sma? 9cross with 65 looks good for re-entry

Hi guys, seems like a nice system. I use a similar setup, but I prefer to use something a little slower moving than a 9 period SMA, but as in any system, the number of parameter combinations is infinite so at some point you just have to go with your gut. I guess your gut says 9 and who am I to argue with another person's gut?  
  
There are 2 contributions I would like to make:  
1\. Use ADX and other trend indicators along with an eye or two on fundamentals to HELP you determine whether the market is ranging or trending on a longer term. It helps to keep that type of info in the back of your mind.  
  
2\. Instead of using fixed levels at 125, 65, etc, you may want to consider using bollinger bands instead in order to take into account market volatility. Although I think the 125 number is a good one at most times, there are times when using fixed levels becomes inadequate. Try to set the b.band parameters so that you are near that 125 level during "normal" trading volumes/volatility. Watch the bands shrink and adjust exit levels accordingly.  
  
Cheers.

Sorry to interrupt this intelligent debate with one of my newbie questions guys, but earlier in the thread twbss1234 said he didn't use stoplosses but I assume if you leave the trade on overnight and you want a good nights sleep you would use a stoploss ?

im sorry if this is a silly question. actually im a bit confused about the exit you mentioned.  
  
should i exit on 45 pip line crossing the 100 SMA or -45 pip line crossing the 100 SMA or... both of it must be crossing the 100 SMA and then close the position?

1.the candle(price) piercing thru the 100SMA but ends up(close) above the 100SMA,do i enter into position?   
2.if candle(price) is the main component to enter into a trade,either long or short,then whats the function of the 9SMA?  
3.pls,also explain your new exit strategy  
thanks!![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

He is tellng you when the 9sma crosses the 100sma after that candle closes thats the entry. You would wait for the close to make sure the cross happens.  
  
you dont enter whe a candle crosses the 100 but when the 9 crossses the 100.  
  
Hope that helps some.   
  
Here is achart showing what a cross entry would look like, the vertical line is on the candle that you would enter on the close of.

Thank you for the EA......now for a stupid question.....(I hate being a newbie...but I have to start somewhere)  
  
  
How do I set it so that when the moving average triggers a buy/sell when the price goes below/above it.  
  
And what do the following mean:  
  
Lots  
Maximum risk  
Decreas factor  
Moving period  
Moving shift  
  
Thanks for all your help.

Hi all. been reading your thread over the last couple of days. finally got to the end. got some interesting stuff out of it and will apply as soon a an oportunity arises. congrats on the openess and sharing looks like we can all gain from peoples input.   
So if i am correct in reading and applying this method. there should be quite a few people long GBP/JPY as at 29/03/2007 for appx 231.13. (and quite a few pips in the money) is this true? it would be obvioulsy too late to enter and i should wait for a reverse entry signal?? if i am wrong please correct me.  
  
cheers

hey billser and allanchi..... don't use that ea to trade real money.... it's just an example of a price cross ma version.... again, don't trade with it....  
  
the maximum risk and decreasefactor money management components designed for that purpose....   
  
the _movingperiod_ value in the inputs sets the triggering moving average.... by default it's 10, change that number to your preference.....  
  
that ea is just a simple example for mq4 code study purposes only..... h 

to trade and code, keep both simple... no call to impress....h

Is there any way that this cross signal can be changed to a sma instead of ema.

a little about me -   
  
I've been "playing" with FOREX for about two years now - looking at system after system - running demo - and finally bit the bullet - put $5000 and opened a MINI account...and yes, like most, sometimes I'm up, and sometimes I'm down,   
  
So far this week, I am 432 pips up with this system by expanding the number of lots in. I opened a total of three mini lots last night and came to the screen this morning with 301 pips green, and a little bit of pullback happening - so, like every great nervous newbie trader, I took it....and now am in Watch and Wait mode to see what's gonna happen next...  
  
I've added a 5/3/3 stoch to this just to guage overbought/oversold condition....seems to help some with re-entry or adding lots  
  
on RVI - does anyone have "level thoughts"??  
  
It seems that about +.13 is about the highest it has been recently, and we're at about +.11 now - I know the author of this post has spoken of not putting a LOT of stock into RVI - just wondering if there is some consideration with the current level we're at with it...  
  
Thanks for a great system!!!!

autolox, stock and RVI are oscilators and when a market trends they can stay hat high or low levels for longer periods of time, or sometimes not much of a sell off will bring them to the opposite and then its off again. butthey do work best in ranging markets. JMHO

hahaha....... no, thats why i am here.  
i will admit i didnt go in specifically on this MA system as i missed the cross as i already said.  
i did look for a PA indication after to help me get in.  
  
As for exit here are my thoughts to date.  
i think we need to have the two lot entry already mentioned.  
I dont like the 125 levels of the 100MA mentioned as i have found that on several occasions in the past, price has already past this point before the entry signal, this is obviousely when the cross happens when we have a sudden price spike.  
  
Instead i would prefer to take a discretionary exit of the first lot once price has hit 100 pips. This exit would be to look for obvious pivot/resistance TL's etc, and to try an eek out a few additional pips beyond that initial 100 pips.  
  
For the second lot exit, may i suggest that some people far cleverer than i look into the ATR signal indicator, the one currently advocated by team aphids Bat method ( <http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=12808> ) .  
look at the signal on the 1hr chart, and see how the trailing exit has captured pretty much all the maximum pips before price turned.  
i think this is a good possible exit tool to use.  
the trailing exit signal does come some time after the initial entry signal i agree, and maybe that issue can be looked at by somebody better than me.  
  
the other main problem i have yet to overcome with this method is the initial stop. TBWSS says he uses no stop at all, that doesnt sit well with me, but i have been burned so many times by stops on trades that ultimately went in the chosen direction then its obviousley something that i need to work on. 

Its gonna happen, it will happen.....i know!

I think the sttop he used originally is if price went against him and crossed the opposite direction. So its not exactly a no stop set up, I think he ment he let it ride until it went his way or crossed back against him.  
  
How would you interpet the Bat ATR for exit?  
when in a uptrend like this, would you exit once price breaks or closes below the blue Bat line? What effect do the settings have on the indicator, would you chnage them?

droesparky,  
  
i see it as no stop as he cant determine what the exit cross would be when it hasnt crossed yet. so when we very first enter the trade, there is currently no stop determined.  
  
As for the ATR, i have looked back and simply considered a break of the trailing signal, so for the current long trade a brek of the blue line yes, i would not even wait for a close below it in my current thinking.  
i have the settings at ATR 5, factor 4.0 and it seems to be pretty good 

Its gonna happen, it will happen.....i know!

From the beginning of the year to date pure SAR is a winner! However, if used on GBP/US is a loser. Has anyone found other pairs this will work with as pure SAR?

I wish my 30M data would go back further; but, just going down the list with FXDD it looks like there are a few that seem to lose very little DD and are winners since end of Jan this year to date. This is just pure SAR.  
What if we get a good list to trade that we know can win (and not lose a lot) and take the trades as they come and when ahead a decent profit just bail out or ride to the end without fear?

Just to keep you in the loop.. I am attempting to find the simplest and most affective way to exit and also enter avoiding whispaws.  
  
Now i have been looking back at the charts and have found something interesting with an indicator inparticular. This is working with the 9SMA and 100SMA.  
  
Is everyone here familiar with the Ickimoku indicator.. It's great for showing trend direction and range filtering.  
  
If you all set up a   
1\. 30 min CHART  
2\. PAIR GBP/JPY  
3\. Ichimoku Hinko Hyo  
4\. 9SMA and 100 SMA  
  
Now take a look at the Ichimoku indicator particularily the Chinkou Span..  
  
Look at the sell signals for example..  
  
When there is a sell CROSS 9-100SMA when the CHINKOU SPAN is BELOW the price we get a correct entry.. When it is above the price we get a false.. it looks to me it happens just about all the time..   
  
Looks intersting...  
  
OH and for exit.  
  
ON a downtrend when the CHINKOU SPAN Rises above the PRICE we exit the sell and on and uptrend when the CHINKOU SPAN Drops below the price we EXIT.. So the buy at the moment looks like it could be ending..  
  
Take a look guys and see when you think  
  
DO you want me to post a chart?

Yes Please ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
and wat settings for ickimoku, default ?  
  
Also lookat at chart, for exit CHINKOU SPAN gives very early exits, but KIJUN-SEN looks good, e.g for uptrend if price goes below KIJUN-SEN then we exit BUY, opposite for sell trades.  
  
Ichimoku Hinko Hyo, filter looks tooo good with 9/100 cross  
  
Looking again at the chart, i see CHINKOU SPAN line is way behind the current price atleast 27bars ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f633.png?v=15.1)

You're right KIJUN looks great for the EXIT..   
  
I'll post up some charts later.. I'm a little busy now..  
  
But look at the CHINKOU SPAN for entry with the cross...  
  
When the CHINKOU SPAN is 40PIPS + away from the Price.. It gives true entries.. When the CHINKOU is Close to the price it mostly gives bad entries  
  
It's also worth reading up on the indicator to get a heads up on how it functions.. it looks great on the 30 MIN chart for the GBP/JPY

On my charts i went ahead and selected NONE on color for everything but Chinkou Span and made my price a line chart so i can see it better. It looks like it lags back a day from current price (not up to current price bar). Is it like that on your chart?

OK so here are the RULES.. and getting closer to a Frickn' awesome system.  
  
1\. 9 SMA + 100SMA ENTRY  
2\. Exit when the prices crosses back over the Kjun-sen.  
  
And let's look at the CHINKOU SPAN for filtering entries.

Yeah it needs to lag..  
  
When there is distance between the CHINKOU SPAN and the price.. The moves are great..  
  
When the CROSS occurs and the PRICE is Close to The CHINKOU SPAN we need to watch out

It's a really simple indicator.. You can look it up at investopedia dot com.. tupe in "Ichimoku Cloud Filters Information Storm" or try that query in google..  
  
It's good to know an indicator back to front before you implement it.

are you sure about when price exits on Kijun-Sen to Exit?? there are a few times we would of false exited. the Kijun-Sen runs pretty close to price. i think i'll have to wait for charts to be posted

just get our then you have a cross of the 9 & 10 against you  
  
\- & it could even be a trigger to enter back in

hi everyone,   
  
I just joined you guys... read the entire thread and the system looks really interesting...I am waiting a cross since monday on 3 JPY crosses...I am 1h timeframe and just entered short GBP/CHF...  
I see some of you are working on 30M timeframe...I guess we can see some more action on that...but wonder about the effectiveness of the method using that TF.  
  
Anybody can post results on 30M TF in terms of % ?  
  
Thanks tbwss1234 to introduce the method and everybody to contribute to its development...

dont take this the wrong way, but do your own analysis....you will benefit from it and not rely on somebody elses figures without knowing if they are valid or not.  
turn off autoscroll, close your eyes and pan back a couple of months. Then then use F12 to advance 1 bar at a time and take notes on what you would do and its almost the nearest thing you can get to live trading.   
see how your emotions will affect your decisions when you dont know whats coming up next, then tot up your total pips at the ned of your evaluation. 

Its gonna happen, it will happen.....i know!

Hi Gang,  
  
On gbp/jpy you all got in around 234.40...congrats.....but I don't see the cross of the ma's. I see the price bouncing off of the 100 ma.  
  
What was the buy signal......can some one put a chart up please  
  
Many thanks,

So as a conclusion now every1 is using the ichimoku indicator for entry/exit together with 100/9 sma?

this is the entry on the 30 mins chart. I'm just testing the method out.  
analyis-wise The BoE decided to hold rates this month, should help weaken it.  
  
I dont expect to be in this trade for too long, i think the carry trade is still on to go long, i expect there to be a cross to the upside after the easter break.

hayseed   
  
do you know if there is a EA out there that takes a trade when price crosses a MA and lets you set the pips for TP and SL as well as # of lots?

hey sparky..... most all ea's will do that ...... if for some reason the ea's author did not include those options, it only takes a second to add them ..... i'll post a few examples from the some of the better coders of the world a little latter....   
  
however, if i could be so bold here..... most all simple ma crossing systems used on small time frames in the forex market will fail in the end...... there is no point denying, when they are hot they are hot but when they are cold......   
  
ma crossovers seem to work better when the higher time frames agree with the lower time frames crossover.... and the agreeing/comfirming higher time frame indicators can be ma's, rsi, stochastic or any such...... think of it like trading the smaller '30 minute' waves on the larger 'weekly' waves..... your still trading the same 30 minute chart as before but only when the larger wave is at your back......h 

to trade and code, keep both simple... no call to impress....h

Thanks for posting that and I can see it easily when I look back at a few charts.  
  
What I am thinking about is to have a set up on a chart approaching that I am willing to take if it happens, I can set the Ea and not have to be there when it happens. I do like the 1 hr and 4 hr charts for crossings, and I like to get in on price crossing for a quick trade then wait for the pullback and the MA to cross for another trade. It seems that most of the time the MA is rejected at least once before its allowed to cross.  
  
thanks again that type of wisdom is always welcome here.

hey drayco..... alerts can be added quite quickly to many standard indicators..... or you can just create the alert in a stand alone "heard but not seen" fashion, if say for instance you don't have need or room on your chart for the extra alerting indicator..... in the unseen manner you could have multiple alerts attached to your chart but not cluttering up the works.....   
  
you didn't mention which type you wanted so i added a 0 cross alert to the standard rvi.... set the input 'alert' to 0 to turn off alert..... and the unseen version has no plot.....h  
  
edit...  
combined a ma cross with the rvi.....h  
  
edited yet again...9/7/2007 7:20.... added simple "**untested** " ea version of 9/90 cross with rvi level setting.... all ma variables are adjustable.... rvi threshold is adjustable..... it preforms as one would expect in backtests.... additional supporting indicators are needed before it could be fully trusted with real money.... post any thoughts for improvements......h

hey sparky..... that's an excellent idea.....   
  
the 0 line will float if the _fixed minimum_ and _fixed maximum_ boxes are not checked and a value inserted when applying the indicator.... +1 and -1 would be the settings in rvi's case.... those settings could be hard coded in the indicator but that can bring on other problems....  
  
as a rule fixed settings are not necessary ...... but if perhaps we want to have the charts time frame _rvi_ and differing time frame using the _mtf rvi indicator_ in the same indicator frame to observe the time frame crossings, we need the 0 solid in place.... this is only an issue when we have 2 differing time frames overlayed ....... otherwise as we scroll forward or backwards the exact point of the 30 minute rvi crossing the 60 minute rvi sometimes will move due to the 0 line floating..... h

hey river..... my preference is for a rvi of 10.... rvi is very similar in shape to stochcastic and stoch(9,5,3) seems fair around.....   
  
i'm not using the method described here in this thread..... my interest is just in tossing a few indicators into the fray...... such as included here..... this is a painted bar indicator in which the bars above the 9/90 cross are lime and below will be red.....   
  
also added 2 arrows for the rvi crossing an adjustable threshold.... default is set to 0...... holler if anything else comes to mind.....h

looks like we got a few whips on the 30 min chart. Thanx to RVI 100 I could avoid them. It seems that now this indicator shows its importance.   
  
Anyone took the new long signal on the 30 min chart? at around 234.40?

yeah, obviously I am. seems to be going well now. I entered at 234.40, and it broke a downtrend line, so I am hoping for it going over 235.   
  
well, is this thread dead ow what? dont see much activity around here

Its impossible to be short, 9 SMA crossed 100 SMA on both 30 min and 1 h chart. Besides, RVI is over 0 on both, so I think we are lucky with a long this time.

No its not impossible. I got short on the 09/04 when 9 crossed 100SMA. as per system for short. but the thing i just relized was my RVI was not set at 100 and therefore was above 0 at the time of the cross. it was set at default. It looks as though that might of been the killer for me. nevertheless my stoploss kicks in at 235.05 so it won't be long till im out it looks

Just a question I hope might bring some fresh thoughts that might not have been covered. (I hope)  
  
It was stated earlier in the thread that the channels should be adjusted from 125 GBP/JPY to like 100 for EUR/JPY and possably 50 for GBP/USD at least I believe thats right.  
  
My question would be: Do we adjust the RIV down to the same levels as the channel?  
  
Thanks

well, as a conclusion until now, it seems there are 3 ways of trading this strategy: one with simple 9sma/100sma cross with RVI confirmation, another one includes also the 125 channels (about which Im not sure how to use it yet), and the last one would be using Ichimoku indicator.  
  
It would be great if more people would post the results and improvements they have for this strategy which has a lot of potential, even in a simple form... dont understand why the owner for example doesnt post anymore. We need more feedback.

hi,  
  
i have done a backtesting and forward testing this method. I use CCI to exit.  
I exit when the CCI touch the zero line  
  
but, unfortunately this day i missed the CCI crossing. I opened a short on GJ @233.78 and got stopped out @234.78. If i didnt miss the CCI crossing up, i might could exit earlier ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1)  
  
so, i think i need an EA to automatic closing my trade, based on CCI(14) crossing.  
  
the EA should be able to close my trade whenever the CCI hit the zero line  
  
can anybody here help me to build this kind of EA? pls  
  
regards  
alfianx

I think the RVI setting stays at 100, because it corresponds to the 100ma and not the channel portion. and it is responding to how price reacts to the 100 ma kinda like a cci but not the same.

If you look at the daily chart there is also a cross to the up side..So I would be very careful.  
  
On the 30M the direction of the 100 sma line is also looking strong to the upside...  
  
Also you have a strong support line  
  
Any thought anyone on the difference between the cross on the 30m and the cross on the daily

It would certainly be useful to have his input. That was very good advice you gave me today Billser. I'm very new to this. Can I ask you do you always check several TFs before entering and if so which ones apart from the daily ?

Hi Bundubill,  
  
I'm also new and what helped me out a lot was the below thread. James16 group. It's long but you will get the idea.

Hi Everyone I am new to this group but am familar with trading moving averages to a point. This looks like a great system even in the ranging markets it's true that profits could be made from what I was noticing it looks like if you were to put a stop about say 25 pips above where the 100 day moving average is that it would not get hit 80% of the time. But i think you would have to enter right on the cross to make sure you catch a positive trade. But as far as the exit strategy maybe a trailing stop could work...  
  
  
Thanks,  
  
Cliff

I think this is a good time to test the strength of this system during whipsaws, coz this is what is happening now. On 30m, we had 2 crosses down already, but because RVI is over 0, not a good place to enter.   
  
I think we have to add to this system strong S/R levels and see how the market behaves around them, if it runs or ranges, and this is also how we can avoid whipsaws better.

I noticed earlier in this thread that the originator tbwss1234 said that during tha asian session he used the 1HR chart because it was so choppy and maybe that is the best TF for us to use in the current conditions

How is everyone trading this strategy?  
  
I try to keep it simple. If 9Sma crosses 100 Sma to the upside, and RVI100 is above 0, I go long. Opposite for short. I also look at the angle of both 9 and 100sma and follow my instincts. Besides this, I am aware of the S/R levels and try not to enter close to one.  
Anyway, during trending periods, this strategy work damn well.   
  
I would like to know how are u people trading using the 125+/- channel.  
  
Thanks.

I have followed this thread as I will any that I have an interest in it contents.  
What has happened to the founder of the thread? This method will catch  
some very nice moves & can keep you out of the range & chop chop whipsaws. I trade a similar method that I put together a couple of yrs ago &  
have good success with it.   
  
Maybe the founder of the thread will return & keep adding his results & ideas  
as this is a really nice simple method.

Yeah I saw that cross. I didn't go for it because the stochs on the IH and 30M were both deep into oversold. I'm new to this and I don't know if I should be taking any notice of the stochs because the originator of the system didn't mention them as a filter. Has anybody got any views on this ?

well, one way would be to use RVI 100 as a filter. When u get a short cross, check if RVI 100 is under 0 level on a M30 chart. If yes, its quite safe to enter the trade. Same idea for the long.  
  
However, recently it seems that all the good crosses offered a few pips, 50 - 100, then the market reversed completely, so consider also using some TPs. Also, sometimes waiting for the cross can get u in the trade quite late. When u see price crossing down 100 sma and u are sure of a potential sell off, by using oher indicators, jump in and dont wait for the 9sma to cross, because by then the trade may be almost finished. This is rather aggressive approach, but looks like the market is a little choppy these days.  
  
Just my 2 cents. Anyone got other good inputs here?

Thanks that's very helpful. Does that use of the RVI as a substitute for stochs apply to most systems or is it specifically for this one ?

I didnt try using it on other strategies, but it acts very well as a filter for this strategy, so I think u should use it with confidence. Also, do some backtesting with it, see how it filters bad entries.

Maybe add RSI @14 or 21 along with MACD @5,13,1. I am not trading this  
method, but just gave it a look see with the above indicators & it looks good.  
Price action is what really counts as we all know. Adding the pivots might be  
a good idea as well.

I have been using the MACD with settings 12,26 and 9 as a filter to this system with great success the last two weeks. I only enter the trade when both indicators (MA's of Eagle Crossover and MACD) points in the same direction. Exit when one of the indicators turns around.   
It seems to keep you out of the market when risky and ensure that you will be in when the big moves in GBP/JPY comes along. When in the market, I log in every hour to see if one of the indicators have perhaps turned and signal an exit.   
Comments will be appreciated.

Hi Handelaar  
  
That's interesting. Do you mean you exit if the 9ma starts to turn down even if it's the topside of the 100ma ? And if you do that don't you miss some of the big moves or do you getback in again when it if it turns up ?

Yes Bundubill, the MACD will sometimes require you to exit from a buy when the MA's are still bullish or from a sell when the MA's are still bearish. So yes, you could miss out on some parts of big moves before the MACD prompts you to re-enter. Generally though, the MACD gives the signal to re-enter in time. On the other hand it gives a valuable early warning to exit when the market turns against you.

Thanks for that. Can I ask are you using the 1H chart or the 30M and do you just rely on the MACD or do you use RVI too ?

I trade on the 1 hour timeframe. It might be a good idea to use the 30min just to get in early if the MA's shows a strong trend but overall the 1 hour would suffice and ads the necessary stability.  
I only use the MACD with that particular settings as a filter for the Eagle Crossover System.   
  
Hope this helps.

In my opinion, indicators like STOCH is only good for range bound markets, since it may cause you to enter/exit a trade prematurely for a trending market. The STOCH can only go to 100% and stop there, and though price can continue onward....

I found this out the hard way yesterday when I decided not to go long on GBP/USD because the stochs showed it was overbought and then watched it go on to make another 90 pips

Because of my lifestyle I often miss the 9ma/100ma cross on this system but I notice that several hours after the cross there are often still big moves going on both long and short. Anyone got any good ideas for taking advantage of these ?

Oscillators in general are meant for "counter-trend" trades... basically the little peaks and valleys you see in the longer term trend. They work great in sideways markets, but only work in trending markets if you trade with the trend. This is because definitions of "overbought" and "oversold" get thrown out the window when everyone is buying/selling like crazy to give strength to the trend.

Thanks for sharing.  
I think if we add momentum into your system, it will much help to spot those long term....big moves!  
"By measuring the amount that a security's price has changed over a given time span, the **Momentum** indicator provides an indication of a market's velocity and to some degree, a measure of the extent to which a trend still holds true. It can also be helpful in spotting likely reversal points.   
  
While the mathematics are straightforward (subtract the closing price _n_ days ago from the closing price today), do not underrate its value because of its simplicity.   
Use the Momentum indicator as a trend-following oscillator similar to the MACD and buy when the indicator bottoms and turns up. Sell when the indicator peaks and turns down. When the Momentum indicator reaches extremely high or low values (relative to historical values) assume a continuation of the current trend. A second usage for the Momentum indicator is as a leading indicator. As a market peaks, the Momentum indicator will climb sharply before falling off. At a market bottom, the plot will drop sharply and then climb well ahead of prices."

iam using 5ema and 8 ema sell when price comes up to 8 along with 5 3 3 stoch 15 min chart also 21 ema and 89 ema are selling points, best when stoch crosses back down., 4 hr tend line has it going to 237.79, just my thoughts

Co-incidentally, the Momentum indicator is the same thing as the slope of a SMA, but with a different scale. I know some people here like to buy/sell when the slope of an MA changes. For SMAs, this point happens when the Momentum crosses the zero line.  
  
The reason why this works is the middle terms of the SMAs cancel out when you subtract the previous bar's SMA from the current SMA:  
  
SMA of n periods: Sum ( Price (0) ... Price (n-1) ) / n  
SMA(1) of n periods: Sum ( Price (1) ... Price (n) ) / n  
  
Slope of SMA: SMA - SMA(1) = ( Price (0) - Price (n) ) / n  
  
very similar to... Momentum of n periods: Price (0) - Price (n)  
  
Again, the only difference is a matter of scale. If you were to plot the slope of an SMA of n periods on top of a Momentum of n periods and have the charting program automatically rescale the two, they would look exactly the same.

I agree, the momentum has similar mathmathic term with SMA. However, what John murphy talked in "[**_Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets_**](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735200661/prophintertoolsf) _and_[** _The Visual Investor_**](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0471144479/prophintertoolsf)" suggest on trend slop pick up, "A second usage for the Momentum indicator is as a leading indicator. As a market peaks, the Momentum indicator will climb sharply before falling off. At a market bottom, the plot will drop sharply and then climb well ahead of prices"

Wow! this thread has suddenly come to life again. Many thanks Blueduddha, Phallbigo and Winwise for your advice, which is appreciated.  
  
Re. the momentum indicator, the originator of this thread said he used the RVI indicator to assess momentum so I assume they are similar but at my current level of indication have no idea which is the more effective. Perhaps you wouldn't mind commenting ?

I've just finished reading through the whole thread and was amazed at how similar this is to a simple, profitable method for the majors shown to me early last year. I don't like to butt in on someones' thread but if anybody is interested......  
  
Btw, is the Eagle still being traded?

Hi Acko,  
  
I became very interested in this thread because as a newbie the simplicity of the method was very appealing and it seemed to work well but I gave up because I never seemed to be able to catch the actual crossover. How does the system you were shown vary from eagle ?

I am like you Bundabill. To look back on price action it is a wonderful stategy but I can't seem to be in front of my computer when the crosses happen. I also tried an EA for ma crossovers and it seem to get me in everything but the actual 1 hour cross.

Hi guys  
tbwss1234 and others, I feel, were really onto something and praise should go to those guys.  
Anyway, this is how I use this particular method. Feel free to implement your own measures, but don't muck around with it too much as it's been good to me as it is.  
Remember, this is a method not a system so work with it to suit your personal trading traits. Create your own MM rules, R/R, TP & SL etc...  
There are other good, simple methods on this site e.g., TEB, Cornflower, to name but two and, for me, the best by far is Bagovino's. This forms the basis of my other system. The point being - Simplicity is the key!  
  
Chart - whatever timeframe you want but under 1 hour gives too many whips, higher TFs = bigger moves. Overlay a 100 ema (or 50 if aggressive), this determines the direction we will trade. If price is above we trade long, reverse for shorts.  
  
Entry - overlay an Ichimoku with only Kijun showing set at default, 26 I think.  
Now, if price closes above BOTH lines enter on the high of that bar/candle reverse for shorts. NO moving ave crosses. Waste of time.  
If price is in "the zone", ie,. between the lines then no trade.  
Always check at least one time frame above to determine trend - this is the filter and very important. Trade only in the direction of the higher timeframe trend.  
  
Exit - notice also that the Ichy moves in defined steps. This are my trailing stop positions after hopefully entering profitable territory. Whenever price turns and hits the Ichy I'm out whether in profit or not.   
  
Set conservative profit targets and you should do well.  
  
Thats it. Simple but effective. Please don't ask me for EAs, backtest results and the like. I wouldn't know how, just mastered right clicking! Like I say, play with it and let me know. Try hard to resist adding indicators.  
Dave

We know that GBP/JPY is a cary trade with huge swap rates, therefore bias will always be long, with occasional corrections. So why not enter long at the cross and exit long at the cross? Short enter at the cross and exit with 50 pips.   
  
This will do 2 things:  
  
First, it will keep you in the long trends, earning a lot of interest and pips at the same time.   
  
Second, it will keep you out of the majority of whip to the short side.  
  
Backtesting this visually on a 4 hour chart (I have a job and can't look more often than 4 hours) over the past years show a very successful method.  
  
I apologize if someone has already posted this as a method for this system.

Those are excellent results from a basic crossover method. I think the reason this thread died originally was because there was no definitive exit stategy. It looks like your results are good overall and the 4 hour time frame is good for those us still working 9 - 5. It does give back a few pips by waiting for the reverse crossover but nothing is perfect in this game.

T4K  
  
I think you are right about the reason the thread originally died, that and its a crossover method.  
  
I guess even most of the weak months in that data could have been a lot better with some type of exit strat.  
  
alos by the time the method crosses back the opposite directions it has given up a bunch of pips many times.   
  
Exits seem to be the hardest for traders to determine, traders with well defined exits are most likely the better traders.  
  
That said the entry on this system is easy to understand, lets put our heads together and come up with another exit for it.  
  
I do think the cross is one exit that can be left in the system but whatelse is there?

**mikejody**  
  
**when you did that backtest did you keep other data, such as the High and low of the trade?**  
  
**If so you could determine and average amount to put as a mechanical stop. That would likely give you beter overal returns.**  
  
**Or take half at that point and let the other run.**

It may be worthwhile to look at the exchange of post between myself and Handelaar - posts 338-340 on this thread. He was using a combination of MACD and the MAs to exit. Unfortunately I never got a chance to use it as I never managed to be there for the entry cross. The method is conservative and will obviously leave pips on the table sometimes.

so was handlelaar saying that when the bars on the macd began to shorten on a long trade he would exit?  
  
I noticed he did not have the lines on the macd.  
  
also this exit you would need a re-entry system as even on long runs pairs will fluctuate a lot, and in most cases that system would have you out way to early?

Hi bundubill et al  
  
Yeh, exits have always caused me problems in the past, often giving back most if not all and then some. Tricky. One method I've used with some success which may be of assistance is to use a 3ma as a substitute for price (or stay with the 9ema whichever suits) and use 30emas of the highs and lows as exits. The highs as exits when long, lows as exits when short. One can always re-enter, but I look for confirmation from MACD Hist and RSI14 before re-entry. Food for thought!  
  
Hope this helps or at least stimulates the grey matter  
Dave

maybe a good entry filter would be to only take crosses that are in favor of the higher tf.  
  
say that now on gbp/jpy the 9 is above the 100 on 4hr so we would not take crosses short until the opposite it true. A little lesson from the cornflour system as long as 4h is long we look for lonn opps.  
  
at some point the 4 hr may turn short and we would miss a bunch of pips on the trend change doing this but perhaps if we are watching multi pairs we can always find a pair or two that are crossing in our favor.  
  
this will still leave pips on the table and dosnt solve the exit.  
  
ps not sure how I got that one post all in bold but it was not intentional!

Yes that is my understanding.  
  
So far as entry is concerned althought the originator of the thread, twbss1234 is fairly dismissive about his use of the RVI indicator(setting100) in his first post, later in the thread he stresses his belief that properly used it protects against whipsaws but I don't know if Acko has ever used it with his system.

with the way talk of moving average ea's polarizes traders, believers in them should develope an ea based largely on pure ma's and submit it in the metaquotes contest.....  
  
that way if it did make any showing at all, no guarentee of that, ma crossover type threads would see more activity.....h 

to trade and code, keep both simple... no call to impress....h

I could never figure out how to use the RVI to the point it would help get me out of a trade, I think it did help some with the original eagle entry.

Hello.  
  
I am on FF forum for a while but I read another thread - the one with '5 min strategy". Great thread.  
  
I started to read this one beliving that nothing can be more simply then the 5 min strategy.  
  
Amazing system. I will try it on my demo account ASAP. In fact a crossing is just it's way. 9MA will soon cross above 100MA meaning a buy signal.  
  
Isn't it?

I'm also concerned about approaching the big big round round number of 250.00 and the long tails of recent bars so have a very tight stop

OK. I changed the SMA into EMA. The lines touches each other but no cross. Did you consider that they WILL cross each other and WILL generate a BUY signal or they actualy crossed on your charts?  
  
On the 2hour chart they do not meet at all  
  
It is important to me...

Stopped out @ 52. The first post states smas, emas are just my preferences change back. Trade with the trend on the 4h chart, better than the 2.  
Reason for entry was stochs turning up also RSI on 4H plus other things e.g., res turning to support around the 249 level. Obviously wasn't to be.  
Hope this helps

There was an excelent signal at around 19:00 GMT but I used 100EMA and 9EMA, 1 week chart, 30 minutes time frame.  
The candle at the crossing was between [249**.66** , 249**.49**] and the price went down to 248**.92**.  
  
So the results could be between [57 and 74] pips in the next hour and a half. Minus spread, of course.  
  
The hours in the picture are GMT+1

Is SMA the Simple Moving Average or is it the Smoothed Moving Average?   
  
Doing a visual backtest, this seems like potentially a very good system.

It is a simple moving average; but surely this 9/100 SMA cross system must have other parameters to it; moving average crosses are no good if used as an "always in" method, going long when cross up happens and short when cross down.  
  
Does anyone know the rest of the system with this 9/100 SMA cross system?

Its pretty much just a MA crossover system. The timeframes for the averages used are designed to avoid <most> but not all whips. It provides easy entries, but exits are harder with this system, that's mostly what has been discussed.  
  
I have seen esp. on higher TFs (daily and weekly) that this system is very effective. Personally, I have this combined with a 28 period Donchian channel which shows me when we are making higher highs and lower lows, and this helps me to exit long moves without waiting for the averages to recross. Of course, it also means I will sometimes get out too early. 

Disregard all prognostications.

Hi Pidgeon.  
  
When you trade the daily do you enter as soon as you get the cross or on the opening of the new candle ?

Can you attach the Donchian channel that you use, and also explain how you use it to exit?  
  
thank you.

Bundubill,  
  
I wait for the open of the next daily candle. This means I enter most trades in the off hours, between the US session close and the next European session open. This makes it easy to go home and look at forex in the evenings (EST).  
  
Dreamliner,  
  
I'm leaving from work in a few minutes, but tomorrow I'll post a chart that shows how I exit using the Donchian channel. I actually got the indicator from this website, so I want to look up the link to it. It has nice entry indicators for trend following, but that's not how I use it.  
  
Example without the charts...  
I see a 9 / 100 MA cross. I look to see that its going in the general direction of the trend ( using weekly or monthly timeframe ). Then enter on next candle. For exits, I look at the donchian channel indicator to see that we are done making higher highs, and then look for a decent retrace away from the channel ( several day's worth not just one day ) and this provides a good exit signal. This will be before we get another cross of the MAs.  
  
Keep in mind I'm only demoing this strategy for now but I plan to stick with it. I got the idea of using the donchian channel from reading "Trend Following" by Michael Covel. Excellent read btw.

Here's my chart with explanations of what I'm looking for. I'll try to find the donchian channel metatrader link later...you could probably do a forum search and find it though.  
  
EDIT: Ok, I found it, here's the page.... <http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=35346>  
I am using the second indicator, not the "general" one.

When I look through history I cant really see any pattern with the RSV.  
If you put an 100 RSI on and then buy or sell only when the 9 MA and 100 Cross and the RSI cross's the 50 level. If the RSI drops below the 50 mark Sell and rises above buy. I would say its good within about 5 or 6 bars prior or after you recieve the MA cross signal.   
  
Ignore all other signals if the RSI hasnt recently crossed the 50 mark and it tends to avoid the false signals.  
  
I havent practiced this yet will start on monday.  
  
I cant see any good exit method yet maybe a 25 trailing stop.

Does anyone know how to create a simple EA that will buy and sell on every MA cross with a S/L of about 15 and a Trailing S/L of about 20?

Gfsound,  
  
How exactly do you trade this method? I'm still here, but I think the method died because of not being able to select an acceptable stop loss method.

Yeah, I can see that. I'm just playing with it myself, and what I'm doing is not getting greedy, as there are pips to be had on nearly every trade. I AM missing most of the big runs. I trade g/j smaller TF's (5M) only in direction of higher TF trend (daily, weekly), going for 25 pips, and use the 9 kinda like a T3- if price breaks the 9SMA I'm out (meaning if a candle closes on the other side). That is, if either condition is met I'm out. Not only that but I have the CCI on there just to see if I can't maybe use that. See attached recent trades for example. You'll notice in one of the examples the trend continues after a small retracement, but I'm not going to chase the market around with this system, especially not on the lower TF's.   
  
  
So please don't get me wrong, I'm far from perfecting it (as I just recently stumbled upon this thread and finished reading it), but it seems like there are too many pips to be had with a relatively simple system. As a big fan of KISS, I DON'T want to turn it into a 23 indicator system or anything, but rather a consistent methodology providing small, repeatable profitable trades.   
  
Anyway, it just seemed like the premise has merit and that there are maybe some SL and exit strategies that have yet to be tested. I don't know- maybe I'm wrong but it seems worth working on a little. Any further thoughts or criticisms or ideas are welcome, of course.

hey there- yeah, I'm using it and still scalping, but I've bastardized the system, to be honest-it has become a hybrid between this and Phillip Nels 5Min intraday system, which is also a MA cross system. So I don't want to muddy up this thread since I feel like I've gone so far from the original intent of the author. My strange, modified scalping system works for me- maybe when (and IF) it ever develops into anything worth sharing I will post. In the meantime, you should check out Philips system if you like MA cross type scalping systems. There are some far more experienced traders than myself (I'm only 2 years in and only live in the last 4 months) that have some great suggestions. Hope this helps.

Hello to all that have contributed in the past to this thread.  
  
I do like this method and have used it over the last couple of weeks with some good success on the GPBJPY and have tried some others as well.  
  
Just wondering if people are still using this method or a variant of?  
  
The exit does seem to be the main issue as well as being whipped out of the trade when it trends. I have experimented with using the 15 MA to exit the trade when I have been up a lot and it has worked well. Last night I did't do well at all with it as I was to late in entering the short trade.  
  
I have attached a template I'm using that also warns when the 15 ma has crossed as well which is just the one I got of the thread replicated with different values.  
  
Does anyone have any templates or indicators they have found usefull for exits?  
  
Would be nice to revive this thread as it seems to have a lot of merit.  
  
Also is anyone using this method for any other crosses?  
  
Cheers,  
  
Dean

Read the thread and like what i see and application of automation would be nice!  
  
I see the USDCAD 60min. chart showing a signal to short at midnight eastern (NEW YORK) time.  
  
On weekly chart shows a top around 1.0350 and bottom of the range around 0.9800.  
  
Therefore, entry at 1.0180 and target profit #1 at 0.9950, #2 at 0.9850, and #3 at 0.9800  
  
  
What are your thoughts?  
  
  
  
I am looking at about 16 pairs to see if this method could be applied.

Thank you all especially NEB for bringing this excellent system to FF.  
I trade forex for 8months now and ive seen alot since im only 18 years old and i got alot of time sitting on forex. I have created numerous systems that work and not but this thing really woke me from all the disapointment and im willing to take some tools from it. Real nice!  
Here are some of my conclusions about it...  
use only as initially posted by NEB only 3 indic. because lets you be alot more concentrated. Theres a way to filter those false signals well one way is by the RVI(not to enter without its cross of 0 line)  
2nd by looking at all TF's and getting in those trade that only support the major trend as some one noticed it earlier.  
Cheers and thanks again![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Back in 2007 (where did the time go), I posted a reply to this thread, post 390. After trying many other systems (how many of you have used those words heh), I've decided to return to the roots of this one, and TRY to keep to the rules. If you read my prior posts, please know that I'm no longer using Donchian channels with this system, and am trading it on the 1H time frame as the original system was designed.  
  
I will try to help those of you who want to understand the original system. The orig poster is long gone, however he is not the only one to suggest using a large MA / small MA cross, there are plenty of them out there. If we set some ground rules, and then follow them, I think we should do ok.  
  
I've been plagued with trying to make short term trades, and by general over-trading lately. I was even using a 5min system, which I really don't have the time for. Based upon my schedule, I can check my charts two times per day: Once at 7:30am EST (right before open of the US session), and once around 9-10pm EST (end of the day for me.) I can't and won't get up at 3am for the start of the London session, and I don't want to worry about trading in the middle of the work day.  
  
Based on the above however, this system still works quite well. It produces a new signal an average of once every 5-10 days. Here are the rules I will follow. They are pretty much the rules from Post #100 of this thread, with minor modifications. I will explain my entry and exit rules, and will explain how the system prevents trading during ranging periods. I will explain where I place my stop-loss. After that, I'll start trading it with these rules on a small account. Follow along if you like.  
  
  
Moving along then!!  
  
CHART SETUP: (This is for the 1H EUR/USD pair only)  
\------------------------------------------------------  
1\. 9 EMA close / 100 EMA close  
2\. On the 100 MA, add 2 levels of +60 and -60 pips. (In MT4, Click on properties, then click the levels tab of the 100MA).  
3\. Add the RVI indicator (from MT4) with a period of 100.  
4\. Add a level of 0.0 to the RVI indicator.  
  
  
ENTRY RULES:  
1\. Price must start outside of the channel formed by the +60 / -60 levels on the 100 MA.  
2\. Once the 9MA crosses the 100MA, we check the RVI. It must be NEAR zero. I know, "near" is not an absolute term, but it must be pretty damn close. If not, we can sometimes wait a bar or two and it will catch up. If RVI is not near 0, this is likely a whipsaw or ranging market, and we pass up the trade.  
  
STOP LOSS:  
I place my stop on the opposite MA100 "level" from the trade. So, if going long, my stop will be on the bottom level, and if going short, the stop will be on the top level. See the attached chart for illustration. This also has the advantage that the stop can be gradually moved up as the trade progresses. For this pair, I have seen one instance where the stop was taken out at the beginning of the trade. In all other cases, the far level was not touched during the trade.  
  
TAKE PROFIT:  
This is the heart of the entire discussion of the thread. I've decided to keep it extremely simple. I'm going to exit on the next 9/100 MA cross, even if it is not confirmed by RVI. This means that sometimes I will exit a trade and then do nothing until the next signal. I have re-read the entire thread from the beginning, and this seems to be as good a method as any. If you are looking for other ideas for exits, read the thread, there are plenty.  
  
I have attached a chart of the EUR/USD showing the latest signal, and will attach another showing ranging behavior that was filtered out by the rules. Some trades will be stopped out, and some will trigger bad trades even with the rules in place. This is ok, as long as the majority of trades follow the existing trend and stay out of whipsaw markets. I believe you can trade most pairs with this system, but am going to focus only on one for now.  
  
We'll see how things go, and I'll post again when the next signal occurs.

Here's another chart that shows crosses which we will avoid.  
Either the RVI is not near zero, OR the price did not start outside the channel before the cross occurred. Not every bad cross will be filtered, our goal is to reduce our trading activity until the market decides on a direction.

As I was writing up the rules yesterday, the system gave a signal on the USD/JPY pair!! But I'm not trading other pairs at the moment. Well, I'll paper trade them anyway, but am going to only report my live trades on Euro.  
  
If you had taken the last signal for Euro (on Aug 10th), you would be short from 1.3190, and up by a measly 434 pips about now. Not a bad place to be. This shows that a TP target of, say 200 or 300 pips, isn't always a good idea.   
  
Moving the S/L up would certainly make sense, I'd have it at 2910, just to lock some profits in.  
  
Ah well, the thing is to make sure we catch the next move and go with it!

Greetings ladies and germs,  
  
I'm watching the EUR/USD, and we might have a crossover soon. Sometimes the prices bounces off the 100 MA, so have to see an actual cross. Also, per the rules, RVI is not near zero yet but is closing in. Still need to wait.

So far this morning, we have two bounces off the 100 MA. Still very indecisive, but RVI is hovering near zero. I'd like to see a nice move above 2915 or below 2825 before taking a trade. Gotta love August....

Hi Pidgeon,  
I have been using MA's on and off for some time and particularly like the setup described on this thread.  
At the moment i am using the 100/9 crossover with MACD for backup.(15m and 30m scalping).  
  
I will be moving back to the longer time frames when we get a bit more volume in the markets in September, but for now i'm grabbing anything from 5 pips to 20 pips on the 15m.  
  
Last night i found an adjustable 2MA crossover alert, and its already proving to be very helpful. (attached).  
  
You may find it comes in handy if you are using crossovers on multiple charts.  
I am watching with interest..so keep the posts coming!![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
Cheers,  
Paul.

Hi PSmith!  
  
Good to have some company on this thread. I think if you look back a bit, you'll see that MACD was being used as a filter as one of the variants of the system. They were even using Ichmoku in place of the 9MA at some point. Some have also scalped with the system, it works for that too.  
  
I think this system works not because of the crossover itself, but because of the additional requirements to take a cross and trade it. I've seen several crosses already on the Eur/Dollar as well as the Yen/Dollar that didn't meet all the requirements, and have passed on them. Last night, I did take a short on AUD because the cross was valid, and agreed with the 4H trend. That trade is up 47 pips as I write this.  
  
As to the MA alert, thanks for posting that. I usually look at my charts during the day, but I don't place any orders until I get home. This lets me do a little reflection on whether I think the trade will be strong or not. Lately we've had a lot of August sideways movement.

Back to talking about the Euro - its still oscillating, came down to 2780, now back up. I'm staying away until we get a direction. If you like to range trade, this is a great market !!

What RSI settings do you mean ? the only additional indicator is R**V** I...  
  
By the way: Somebody was testing this with a multiple-lot-entrance, based on an ATR-Exit ?

If u know ur trendlines well. U wont have a problem with exit in this sytem. Sometimes trend lines might seem to promt u to exit too early but cmon no need to be greedy if the trend line is crossed again I re-enter. Simple and easy 

Add value everyday in Pips

Hi guys,  
  
just found this thread, not sure if anyone is still using or will check up on it but im going to give it a whirl.  
  
Entry as per original rules.  
Initial SL of 20 pips.  
Move SL to BE after 10 pips  
TP is at cross of 9 back over the 100 and reversal of position.  
Obviously S&R and trend lines will be taken in to consideration.  
  
lets see how it turns out  
  
EDIT: 5m time frame
