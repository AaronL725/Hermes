**Greetings to everyone** ,  
I hope when you have made your first visit here you are in "good health". This is your first visit but not your last, since your experience here will create that spark to keep you burning with interest and the drive to make and keep profits.  
  
In this thread my only aim is to share the strategies that i have overtime put together with aims of creating a set and forget system.  
I have had a 9-5 (JOB) since i have been introduced to trading, which i love but have been experiencing a thug and war between it and trading. I have been leaning more towards trading though.  
I have done quite a bit of research and development over the few years, some traders may have seen these methods before but i know for others it will be their first time.  
  
My preferred method of trading is with expert advisors as it removes emotions and overall human errors. I chose to use E.A.'s due to the fact that I always miss the best setups due to sleep or working.  
  
I concentrate on capitalizing on most if not all opportunities presented by the market. doing breakout trades, trading ranges, reversals etc.  
Through all the content found online, i have fused what i consider to be the good aspects of each.  
My trading has brought profits and we all know if not managed well, the market will take some if not all.  
My system is not perfect but my sole purpose is to get it as close as possible to perfect with the help of great traders and coders here on FF.  
  
Most of my trading has surround the way Wyckoff had looked at the market and i found this out just recently, when the light bulb came on.  
Below will be the diagram for which my system is geared towards capitalize on. My trading over the years, have brought me to the different stages of the diagram but i hope to capture it in full with one system or a combination of systems.  
  
  
Thanks for stopping by.

_**Breakouts**_  
  
I will address breakout trading over the Asian session, we look for consolidation, where candles are trapped in a tight box and it moves up and down from support and resistance, where the idea will be to place two pending orders above and below the range at a distance of about 10-15 pips depending on the volatility of the asset and let it ride after the breakout.  
  
What i have found is that a trending market versus a ranging market prior to the European/London open reacts differently respectively, these formations are also best observed on the 15 minute chart.  
  
  
Nb. These same formations also occur on the higher time frames, which will yield larger profits and different timeline for maturation.  
The higher times that i would observe would be from M 15 to the daily chart.

There is absolutely no reason that the market should behave this way.  
As a matter of fact your guess of any market phase is as good as anyone else's  
Hindsight is always 20/20  
But do not despair, what is important is what you think you see and how you engage with it.

Hmmm I see a pattern emerging. You are a troll and you need to behave yourself. Leave others to express themselves and their trading style the way they want to without having to endure crap from you. Just because you don't do it doesn't mean it doesn't work.

**Thanks** for all those who have spent time to read thus far, we have just started and will continue. Thank you for your thoughts everyone, they have been read and considered. Shifting out the **bad** and leaving the **good** is the main aim here. I am also sure that many thoughts will come through and combine to create something of worth.  
  
I will continue with the range breakout, Displaying the ease of tools/indicators that make life much easier in identify the ranges for potential breakouts.  
Each asset has their own volatility and average daily range that they move daily. Just like the laws of nature an inflated ball that is suppressed under water, will not remain constricted for too long.  
  
The smaller the range the larger the breakout. Over time you will see the pattern more often. You will find similar formations on other pairs over the Asian session but different size ranges.  
All i did was to place pending orders One Cancel the Other (OCO) or Leave it with stop loss attached. At times it may continue in New York session however it does not always happen this way so you may either take profit or set a trailing stop above your initial target.  
  
Just imaging higher time frame similarities, whereby the larger the time frame the larger the pips and duration respectively. For everyday trading the m 15 will present more opportunities. Just imaging some traders who only require 10 pips per day for their reward and they are finish for the day, and one asset can give you 50 pips or more, they would complete a week worth of trading with this one setup. Cheers!

For those who are interested in seeing the possible results from their own charts, I will post a**few Session** based**indicators**. These indicators are found **free** on FF and other online sources. If you have any that is suitable for this strategy you may **share** them as well.  
  
The aim is for you to **observe the formation** on your own charts being the M15 chart time-frame, starting with the **majors** first. Concentrate on the movements  
from **Market open** Est. time-**Sunday through to Thursday** , you may find the setup on Fridays too.  
  
**_Indicators on the Chart above is:_**

  1. **MM-Sessions**
  2. **6 Exponential Moving Average** (ema)-**Yellow**

You may also use other ema's as you desire or see fitting for the identification of possible breakout direction. Some use both 50 and 100 ema by observing where it is positioned in relation to the range, whether it is above, running through the range or below. Some have also used other directional based indicators to help them determine their bias for the likely directional price break. Those indicators may include and are not limited to the use of pivots, macd and such the like.  
I choose to keep it simple as you see in the picture above, you may state your preference or findings here.  
  
**Entry Rule:**  
We place both**Buy** and**Sell pending orders** _(10-15)_ pips away.  
  
_**Buy Entry**_

  1. At the resistance of the range- we place Pending** Buy Stop**
  2. Stop-loss should be placed at the opposite side of the range-support.
  3. Take Profit can start at 2:1, 3:1 and higher depending on the assets daily range.

  
_**Sell Entry**_

  1. At the support side of the range-we place pending **Sell Stop**
  2. Stop-loss should be placed at the opposite side of the range-resistance. 
  3. Take Profit can start at 2:1, 3:1 and higher depending on the assets daily range. Therefore if the range is 25 pips then your stop-loss would be 25 pips while the Take profit would be (2:1)= 50 pips or (3:1) 75 pips. This ensures that every win will cover for each loss, when the event arise. With a 2:1 or 3:1 risk to reward will in the end keep you profit.

The broker I used at the time had One Cancel the other for pending orders through trade station which is link to netstation (black Charts above). One Cancel the other, operates in a unique way, where by when one order is triggered the other one is automatically canceled. Nevertheless, there are times when price breaks both levels during the London session or New York session. So it would be**wise** to either **close half** of the position upon reaching the **initial target** , as well as **move your stop-loss** to **break-even or in profits** after say 30 pips or as you choose for a free trade.

When do we get the **best ranges** in the market leading up to a **good breakout** with **good momentum?** Yesterday **June 5, 2017** was one of those days, with **AUD, GBP and USD** correlated pairs?  
When trading**breakouts** we need **momentum** to drive the market and **push our trades** in our favour **for** **fast and quick pips**?   
  
This materializes well during strong fundamental events, where we apply technical analysis to capture what happens in result of the announcements...   
Inflated ball under water must emerge...

This week offered many opportunities for successful trading of breakouts, reversals and such the likes.  
Thursday into Friday Eastern Time offered us another opportunity.  
  
Throughout Asian session leading into New York Session gave good results as expected with the line up of a ranging market. Our candidate this time was USD/CAD, with a Prime Setup for those who hold the indicator in their hands this week. Should this pair, be traded by those following would have gotten the least 60+ positive Pips gain on your account on one asset.  
  
Cheers!

Thanks for being such a great friend over the years i have known and worked with you...  
  
  
Thanks for being such a great friend over the few years, i have worked with and known you...  
I hope this project could be an easy one for**Excellent Coders** like yourself...I am willing to get any help i can with this project, It should be simple, i think for any advance coder. I have been creating system after systems and based on what i have seen it do from the start of my journey until now. My **_dream/Goal_** would be for full automation of a set and forget system.  
  

  
A **fully automated system** should be able to:  
  
**_Part A:_**  
  
1. Identify the normal **pip range** of the assets,   
2. Identify **Red News**  
3. Identify ranges that are obviously **tighter** than **average daily range**   
4. **Place Stop orders** at the **Resistance and Support area + Spread** with S/L at the opposite end of the range**T/p** minimum should be **1:1 pips** But i prefer 1:2-1:3,1:4,1:5 etc Risk:Reward respectively. When one aims for a higher Reward:Risk the long term effect is a profitable outcome, one trade may be able to cover 1 or 2 previous losses, especially if a trade was triggered on both sides.  
5. Filter out False breakouts  
6. Take Profit system to close out a portion or move S/L closer, Trail T/P whichever one is easier  
  
_**Part B:**_  
  
**If no Range** -How to trade Range or Breakouts  
  
7. **Range markets can be traded** \- Yes, through the use of Cam. Pivots R3 to S3 which identifies**bounces or rejection**.  
8. ******No prior range** = Don't worry, (**Market Orders**) within the session breakouts can be identified by Cam. Pivots @ **R4/S4**. In this scenario we can utilize tools using pivots in identifying **True Breakouts.** **Buy Direction** over the region of (**R4** **Breakout zone** upwards with **T/p** @ **R5-R6** , S/L= below R3) While **Selling** Pressure at **S4 Breakout zone** Identifies the Breakouts downward with**T/p** @ **S5-S6** & S/L @ Above S3.   
  
10. **Incrementally Increase Lot size** by _account growth_ while exercising **good Margin** on the account.  
11. **A fixed Time slot for sessions** and be determined by user for GMT=Difference as GMT 1, GMT 2, GMT 3 etc. Based on the brokers MT4 Time.  
12. Lastly be able to make money, like the pictures show it can do- Probably show last trade**win or loss** for assets-**Dashboard like**. **THANKS**

Your welcome djms, there is more to come.  
  
As long as someone **responds** and shows their **interest** apart from reading and trying out in **silence** i am willing to share more of the knowledge i have gained along my trading Journey. I have done research and development on MQL Coding of E.A. Indicators etc, with hard earned 9-5 money alongside having a high living expense.  
So i am hungry to earn in an informed and legal way, helping others who are willing to learn to do the same through this thread.  
  
Trading **profitably** can be done and has been done by many, so i am just willing to share, i know it **will help someone**. I believe **the market has more than enough for all of us.** So sharing my way of looking at the financial charts available to everyone **will not take away from me** benefiting from the markets. We all have**one life to live** and my aim is to **help others** who are less fortunate. Whether through helping them in getting a job, business, food, shelter, clothes, etc. We tend to**sometimes** forget where we are**coming from or could have** been and that there is **a bigger picture** to life.   
  
More to come, stay tuned Cheers.

There are added tools that can be utilized to help identify the likely direction a trade will take...  
  
Such as, yes some lagging indicators like:  
Moving averages  
Macd  
RSI  
Stochastics  
Pivots  
Fibonacci  
CCI  
TDI  
Price Patterns-flags, pennants, triangles etc breakout formations  
  
Everyone has their preferred tools and ways of looking at the markets.  
The first thing any trader should do is identify firstly what their preference in trading is: Trend trading, Breakout, scalping, reversals, range markets, etc.  
I am a breakout trader, so when i see ranging markets i get excited for what is to come. However in every system there maybe critical points and it is for you to identify them in order to minimize, eradicate or manage them.  
  
Feel Free to post your charts, comments and findings.

For Setting up the MM Session or any other sessions Indicator.  
Please to visit <http://forex.timezoneconverter.com> and this site will help to identify the hours that should be imputed into the indicator settings, then after you can save the template and apply it to other charts.  
  
Remember there is an overlap for the Sydney and Asian session, Asian and London session, as well as London into New York session so the two colours will blend into each other.  
  
I combine Sydney and Tokyo into one. based on my time it is two hours after US Session.  
I don't trade "Chf", so i havent really observed their open with the Sessions indicator, for the reason of the high spread and Margin required to keep a trade versus the payout i get.   
  
You can change the colours which will be good for your memory identification I Choose bright colours like purple, orange and sky blue. Overtime the colour coordination will be better for easier candle identification and ease of eye pressure.

**Its posted in (#13)** I could not help but share it, since **sharing the knowledge** will be the only way to know if it is simple (**KISS Method**), where by even a newbie would be able to easily**experience success** with it as well. For me**i believe in giving to provide room for receiving** , so i have i chosen to share in high hopes that it will**help others**.  
Apart from earning figures on your account, sharing it would be the only way to know whether it has any **real value** , through **constructive critiquing** from my role models right? Those who have walked this road before me.

No for a little summary of how i look at the pivots...Daily, Weekly, Monthly  
  
IF price remains above the daily pivots we are looking for Long Trades  
If price remains below the daily pivots we are looking for Short Trades   
  
Cam Pivots for Bounce and Breakout trades whether there is a range or not...

I will also do my best... CliffyC.  
  
The pivot pictures posted above of fridays close would not have been the most ideal way to view the potential accuracy but it does work.  
  
I would have to use a historical plotting pivot to highlight the above strategy in its fullness.

Exactly, the **average daily move** would allow us to know when a pair is acting outside of its normal **characteristics**.  
**Signs** of low or high **liquidity** are general signs of overall volume or traders observing and **responding to situations** : it could be ec**onomical, political, natural disaster, crisis** etc depending on the asset. So yes in my opinion of **adr** would give us a **_guide_** for expected trading movement, take profit and safe placement of account protection.  
  
Even though other**indicators** can be used to **aid** in giving us a **bias** , we have to be aware of **fundamental** situations which sometimes over ride the technical rules. The use of pivots and other indicators can be used, however price can do what we least expect it to do, but we will atleast have an **edge**. Its is all high and low probability in my thoughts.  
  
Nevertheless price has **historical** **characteristics** in movements and if we learn to observe and understand an asset we will be better able to make informed decisions.

CliffyC, what I recently started to do was to monitor the brokers asset [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide"), margin requirements, payout per pip in order to know which assets to spend more time on. As it makes no sense to me, to trade assets of high spreads, similar currency strengths, which only pays out less than all our risk and efforts.  
  
There are some assets which can give you a large pip move but requires more margin and spread to pay the brokers to actually carry out the transaction. Pairs like the exotics nok, zar, rub, mxn and others. However the ranges would be different but when ever they choose a direction they just head there.  
  
I am also doing an excel spreadsheet in table form to identify historically range data per asset which would help us to identify the best range levels in which we would expect an asset to generate better breakout results.  
  
It would be good if we all work on it and compile one document to serve as a cheet sheet. For eg eurusd ranges between 10 and 20 pips during Asian sessions, while usdjpy would be let say 15 to 30 pips for ranging situations. So we have an idea what we should look for in take profits as well mentally establishing our overall best risk:reward, a pair range guide sheet alongside the average daily range in one spreadsheet or dashboard.  
  
I hope there is an indicator that will allow us to reach the cheet sheet goal much easier. Like a dashboard which we could place on the chart, giving us a hint of which pair to spend time on as added filter. This would identify what the **safe** ranges are based on ADR of the asset, which would in turn give us a final signal for trading conditions- eurusd-trade, usdjpy-no trade.

For a simple but effective dashboard I think "CJA" and others had made a similar indicator in the past. Oh good, I just did a quick search and saw one.  
  
Those that already exist would probably need a slight adjustment to fit the criteria that would be best suited for this information.

Hurst, thank you for your kind opinion and commitment. I look forward to what you and others will have to share, impacting others for greatness.  
  
I hope to be of great help to others who are starting and struggling with no one to hold their hands, jumping from system to systems. Hopefully this can help families who struggle financially or just need more control over mediums of investing.  
  
I also have other systems but I would prefer sharing this one first since its easier to grasp. A KISS method. I like this strategy for the very fact that it mentally provides ease in making trade decisions. One can trade it plain with the session indicator or add other indicators, I like to keep it simple.

Hi PriceJ58,   
  
Would you be able to share your strategy in a step by step mechanical way so that people interested in building an ea can come on board to make this happen?

Please refer to post #13, I will expound more on whatever details I think is necessary information needed for coding. I have highlighted the fact that I have started to collect data on the range parameters of each asset that is suitable for a breakouts. However each asset ranges for different reasons. My basic knowledge would suggest that when the market is either expecting high impact news or the session for the asset is closed, it would range.

For my strategy I will continue to use photos to illustrate how to do it yourself. Other wise I will place information on trading essentials to get you up and running under your name here on the thread. I also hope it will help others, unfortunately I will only be able to do so later.

So as i stated earlier i was**doing an excel sheet** that whoever is **serious** about **trading this strategy** can take **some time** to look over the**pairs** and see **which market** they would **normally range** in and identify it. After identifying the range of that particular pair would operate between before a breakout.  
  
_**Rules and Example**_

  1. For eg- Eurusd is operating between 10-30 pips during Asian Session
  2. Hopefully there is a news in london session
  3. My time is **Gmt-5** , I would look for this range between**7pm-11pm** my time which is **8pm-12pm** US time to which asian session would continue for about **3 hours after** i place my orders for the **London open** **2/3am** depending on day light time saving mode.
  4. I would place **Pending buy and sell** stop orders 10 pips **above** and **below** the range and go to sleep zzzzzz.
  5. Wake up around **5am** my time **6am** US time to close my trades manually before US session open, where ever they were in **profits** or **losses**. If it were **winning** , I would move my stop loss to **breakeven** , or **close a portion** of the trade and leave the rest to run with stop loss at breakeven.
  6. I would **look** for this on **all pairs** to **choose** the **best setups**.
  7. **N.b.** the**acceptable range** _across the pairs_ will be _**10-50 pips**_ in range according to the **volatility** of the **asset** for eg. **Gbp pairs**.

What i was _**aiming for daily**_ was to place _**6 orders**_ and to capture the **minimum 50 pips** = **300 pips!!!!! Yes 300 Pips, My trading week would be Sunday/Monday to thursday= 1200+ pips. I would rarely trade friday but** the market conditions changes from time to time and we have to **adjust accordingly.**  
  
**"Practice" to mark the charts** **_10-15 pips_** (depending on the asset) **above and below** the **range**. When you practice on chart and do your homework/Research it helps us all to be better. Besides, this will allow you to see whether or not you would have been triggered **negatively** or **positively**. Finally Check to see when it would be ideal to take profit! For eg. **Taking profit in the same session, next session, end of day or let it ride.**  
  
**When you have compiled your excel sheet, please post it here and we will compile everything into one master cheat sheet. Hopefully we get similar findings. Persons who are more advanced in excel can modify it. Thank you for time.**  
  
**Cheers to a easy and probably better trading life. You tell me. Enjoy your Weekend Guys.**

Those who have concerns about the range of _**10 to 50 pips**_ . Here is an example using **GbpJpy H1** to show more than one breakout opportunities.

Hi PrinceJ58,  
  
Thanks for sharing your step by step guide and excel sheet. For the excel sheet, do we fill up for the last trading day or average over last x days? If average, how many days? For adr, do we use 5 day adr? For cam pivots, how do u get level 5 and 6 formula? I only found up to level 4.  
  
Sorry for asking so many questions. Just want to make sure i will fill it up correctly. And also others will get it right too. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Fanatics, hmm, someones pulling a wisdom tooth here, ok for the Excel sheet concentrate on those you currently trade. I have traded mostly the majors, i have tried almost all pairs other than the exotics once a range had existed.  
  
I chose my assets based on spreads, Margin Requirements, and beauty in setup. I would have done this on mobile.  
When i first started i did it on naked charts-yes as simple as that, the mobile app at the time was trading station along with Netdania, so i did not have all these fancy stuff-indicators and such, just the cross hairs and One cancel the other (oco)- pending orders. However when i tried commodities with same rule on m15 back then it was not favourable with oco orders, where by one order was triggered by a false breakout, while the other pending order by nature would have been cancelled only to go in the opposite direction. So oco can work for you and not work for you.  
  
All in all the MM session or sessions indicator is enough for us to identify the range for now, which is good enough with my thoughts nof keeping things simple. As for the ADR and Cam Pivots, those would only be necessary when you have grasp the simplicity of trading just the ranges with little or no indicators.  
  
However for those who are still interested and want to step it up from the start, we can add ADR for average movement, CAM Pivots for bounces and breakouts for none range markets. These added indicator would allow one to better see what is happening with price action.

For Pivots and Cam-Pivots you may find the attached indicators below..Use with caution.  
It would be good if someone could**add alerts** to **All Pivot Points** -a very effective all in one Tool.  
  
I would rather keep things simple

I have not used the ADR as yet...So i am not aware of which one will work best at the moment as i have just downloaded them. I will be retiring to B.E.D. at this point since it is now midnight.   
  
I hope these indicators will help us in our task for greatness...  
Fanatics, thanks for the questions, you reminded me of things i did not accomplish yet, so you have kept me on target.  
I am looking forward to the results of the excel spreadsheets.  
  
Nb. Keep your charts as clean as possible, the less indicator existing on your charts is best.   
The less indicators we have to monitor the less brain power, required to accomplish the task.   
  
So greetings to one and all, please keep safe until we meet again.  
  
  
  
Cheers!

Hi PriceJ58,  
  
Assuming the range of EURUSD during asian session is 25 pips today and it's lower than the average range during the asian session. So for long order, you place a buy stop 10 pips above the high and sl is 10 pips below the low. For short order, you place a sell stop 10 pips below the low and sl is 10pips above the high right? Does this mean that you are risking 25 pips + 10 pips (buffer above) + 10 pips (buffer below) + spread in total? Then you tp would be 90 pips away assuming RR of 1:2?

Assuming the range of EURUSD during asian session is 25 pips today and it's lower than the average range during the asian session. So for long order, a buy stop 10 pips above the high-**Correct** and sl is 10 pips below the low- **no** just below the low**plus spread**. For short order, you place a sell stop 10 pips below the low and sl is 10pips above the high right?- no **just above the high plus spread**. This means that we are risking 25 pips + spread ( the buffer is the pending order room to ensure there is no false triggering of order due to spread and wicks...  
  
It is the adr that would help us to determine the possible reward that we could likely get based on the total movement already made. So if the pair moves 90 pips on average and so far it has only moved 20 pips. There is a high probability that we would be able to achieve the mininum 50 pips. Even though our aim would be 1:2 or above like a 1:3, or 1:4. However in this case the remainder is possibly a 1:3. So i would close out a portion of my trade at 1:2, leaving the rest to run above breakeven.

Thanks for the clarification. So my understanding was wrong. However, something still puzzles me. For a range of 25 pips, the total risk is 35 pips plus spread right, since we place our pending 10 pips above the high.   
  
Also for a long order, should stop loss be below the low of the range or at the low exactly? In this case, to close a long order we use the bid price, so there is no need for the spread right?   
  
Criteria for trade entry would therefore be

  1. Range of session below average of say last 10 sessions
  2. ADR has room from entry to target of at least 50 pips (or min 1:1 RR - my preferred way of calculation)

Do you use say London range to determine an entry during new York session? I was think for example USDJPY, this pair should be more active during Asian and US sessions. So can we use London range to get an entry during US session?

Yes, any session that has a range prior to the next session open maybe used to place pending orders for high impact data to be released. We must realise that each pair is different, has its own characteristics and ranges during varying sessions.  
  
Think of it this way, the US session data release often times tend to move and affect most if not all markets. This is so for the reason that most pairs are inter-correlated with the USD.  
  
When a market is closed we expect their dominant curency or index to lose volatilty/volume, since their business day is closed and everyone goes home to sleep. When their session re-opens in the their morning which is their regular business day,  
news releases is an inevitable factor within their business day. So while these are being released their local businesses/ coorperate community can participate in these activities. Therefore the banks and multinational coorperations will respond to the data, such as interest rate which will affect investments, business deals, money value-loans and assets etc.  
  
Therefore these ranges are due to the waiting period and suspense leading up to the news item. The breakout is usually the response and reactions to these fundamental releases. Other situations being political and social stimulants will drive the price higher or lower through the institutions that are able to pump millions into any particular direction to capitalize on the present situation in the business arena.  
  
These are the things that will sometimes overide technical based strategies existing in our trading world. Remember that trading has 3 facets- Like a stool/three legged chair...technical, sentiment and fundamental. If a foot is missing we cannot sit.  
  
To answer your question on stoploss. It is placed on the opposite side of the range almost on the very line. However we should make room for the testing of that support or resistance should price reverse to trigger stops and orders, setting it too close to the breakout level may also trigger the stoploss prematurely, that leaves one out of the trade, with loss of capital, only to see the trade continue in our.initial favour.  
  
From this moment load the template use virtical lines for entry on a candle and place horizontal lines for entry of the 10-15 pips and the opposite side of the box on the line for the stoploss and see how many times it will get triggered prematurely or observe how many times price comes back to test the opposite side of the breakout. It hardly does, so i would say it is safe to place it on the line. So on a buy order just place it at the support level of the range. I will post a picture later to higlight this with illustration as a visual perspective to display my description.  
  
i acknowledge and respect the fact that we all learn differently: through the use of audio, visual, kinestic and the combinations of 2/3.  
  
I might not be able to do the audio, so for those persons, you may read aloud what is written so you may hear yourself, record it and play it back, write it down in your trading journals. Practice on the chart, do whatever it takes, you have to be ready and hungry to set your future on the right path.  
  
Cheers!

IMO, I agree with PrinceJ58 every pair have its own characteristic, e.g. UJ is fuel by the Tokyo open like GBP on London etc, but it must be correlated with news data pattern.

Can you expound in detail on that spreadsheet Data, how it is generated and is it able to help in this system? Based on what is required to take a more favourable position in the markets?

The main driver for your system is volatility/momentum it’s the heart the keeps your system alive. Hence the vessel for the system correlated purely on the historical data patterns on news release (high impact) by doing analysis on historical data say 3 years data on correlation on news release to your strategy you will fine days or weeks that you should entry or not hence improving on the winning ratio.

Yes i must agree on the momentum and heart beat comments in relations to fundaments. Apart from paid subscriptions to research driven institutions like reuteurs, bloomberg and others is there any other way of doing this? Otherwise i bring no pressure or request... I am wired to find a way. ;-)

Historical data (research) brings a pattern which you can use like a road map. E.g. historical OIL/NFP/CPI/PPI/ECN/FOMC/RATE at time bar XX:XX u will notice a pattern when it start to move etc; human behavior wont change so easily hence this pattern can be use

Earlier you mentioned that you place your orders 3 hours before London opens. So in this case, not the entire Asian range is considered. Or should you place your orders at London open?

Agreeing with okshop's and princej58's volatility and momentum principles, I have special attention towards yen and chf this week. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Good Cliffy, That is really good.  
  
I will post my simple _**technical analysis**_ , if i were to go beyond the Strategy i am currently concentrating on for this thread. I do not like to deviate but i will just to get my point across, in a simple way...As i want to and would love to keep things simple.  
  
The asset of choice due to Tuesdays expected news events will be GBP/JPY  
  
_**Just as an example.**_  
  
  
**Do not use this illustration _as a signal or advice for trading_ _._ I will not be held responsible for your actions.**  
  
**Here goes my way of looking at things simple in trading. The price either respects the support or breaks the level. If it were to respect the level and remain above we would look for a long entry signal. While the opposite situation is also true, if it were to break and close below the level of support i would look for a short signal.**

For the Strategy i will still use GbpJpy, lets say this was Monday evening Est, which would be Japans Morning -Asian session.  
  
I repeat i like to keep things simple, however due to the fact that i have placed pivot points on the thread, i will show you things through my simple thought process.  
  
If price should remain below the daily pivot we should be looking to trade lower for that day. For a weekly outlook it has been trading below the weekly pivot due to the past events, political and economical events. Such as bombing, shootings, Election etc.  
  
  
The simple way is just to place both orders with stop-loss attached as indicated in the illustration. I hope this helps someone, those who are still trying to figure out visually what i look for...  
  
Remember this is just an example.  
  
**In this case for visual purposes the ASIAN SESSION -NAVY, LONDON- DARK VIOLET AND NEW YORK-TAN in Colour.**

London open would have been too late for me, that is my 2/3am and i would be sleeping, so usually the range is usually maintain for the couples hours left in the session, once a range is established. This is like a lion hunting, he has to stay low while he is stalking his prey, if he roars or making any sounds before the prey will run and likely get away.   
So in order to not be affected by spread and broker keeping me from entering a position i would place the order before hand, this is why the buffer works well for me in this case, as price has the room to move up or down 10-15 pips without triggering my order. I hope this helps you and others.   
  
N.b. sometimes price moves so quickly across the pairs it would be hard to place the right pending orders and stop-losses so quickly at market open.  
If you are able to be up you can place your orders even 1 hour before the market opens.

Sorry for more questions again. Was studying your chart and I have the following questions:

  1. Your buystop is only 10pips above the high and not 15pips?
  2. The sessions indicator doesn't seem to take into account the first candle? This seems to be a bug of the indicator? As a result, your low for the range is like 10pips higher than what it should be?
  3. Right now, the range has increased compared to when you posted. So the stop orders levels would be quite different from yours, depending on the time when the orders are placed. This would probably result in pretty much different outcomes I think.
  4. So you do not trade if there are no red news events for the day?

I would say that was an error on my part where notations were being made on the chart photo, however the pending order as i have stated can be between 10-15 pips away from the range, so 10 pips in that situation should there be a valid setup at the time, in such a case it would have been perfect for placing orders.  
  
Anyways it is time for you to look for setups at this time-which is now. Practice to set them 10 pips away and 15 pips away and wait until probably an hour prior to US session open to view the results.  
  
  
**PRACTICE PRACTICE**...Forget about the fears and go ahead and place the orders on the tight ranges, drag and drop the assets from the market watch to your charts to see which asset is ranging and place both buy and sell stop orders on your**demo account of course**.

Some random thoughts about sentiment and the upcoming fomc statement and boj press conference thingy - I'm thiking of a Long aud/jpy and long aud/chf (looking at safer assets to price in)  
personally, I haven't mastered to trade the emotional volatility for fomc statement.   
  
random - aud/chf (reason - two bars down, two bars up) daily tf  
random - aud/jpy (reason - entirely waiting on a pull back) daily tf  
these two are my thoughts because of this week's events.

Give it some time my friend... let it ride, i think i am in the same ones except the chf. I dont like the spread.  
The last time i checked the gbpjpy it was about 78 pips in profits, hmm thats +28 of what is really aimed for by my original goal, however they say let go your losers and let the winners run.  
Whenever the spread is close to the orders open rate you will see what seems to be a negative, thats the brokers fee for generating the transaction on your behalf, so give it some time to settle in, let it ride. For 6 assets based on a 50 pip aim how hard would it be to see 300 pips from these 6 assets if they have a high adr.;-)

Fanatics just to show you a chart example.  
You can use any tool to get to the same outcome, it all depends on you and what you are looking for, you create your own rules.  
  
_**On the picture we have:**_

  1. Fibonacci,
  2. Asia open-close indi,
  3. Pivots
  4. Daily Open Indi
  5. and a range indi-testing (Don't know how it works really)

So it does not matter how you trade  
What you use to trade as long as there is consistency. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60e.png?v=15.1)  
_**We should learn from our mistakes more than we learn from our success.**_  
  
It does not feel good when we fail but the most important aspect of the journey is what we do after we fail.  
  
**First**  
**Attempt**  
**In**  
**Learning**  
  
**Cheers!![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f4aa.png?v=15.1) Keep at it.**

Channels, Naked or indicator based trading you choose. In this chart illustration you will see where price moves in channels, either being rejected or breaking levels. Most times from a long term perspective, price will respect these zones well. This is a sneak peak to my other style of viewing the markets.  
Whether this is considered right or wrong it works for me. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
I would love if others share their charts or concerns, otherwise i will lay low, remain invisible. Probably a good idea...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f4a1.png?v=15.1)

I'm interested to learn how you take profit from your positions. I had a loss on EURUSD earlier (a long position). Currently, the rest of the positions are turning into positive. Some are nearing take profit price which I set as RR = 1. Do u take profit as a basket of trades? Or let individual positions take profit based on your RR? Do you hold your positions overnight?

Ok Fanatics, you have been asking some great questions, keep them coming.  
The idea is that you either aim for 2:1 or more, you can move your stop-loss to this level of 2:1 after the last retracement near to that level.  
For e.g. If i should evaluate all pairs that are currently open, whichever side that is triggered first i let it stay and close the opposing pending orders.  
  
When i evaluate on the longer term charts like the 4hr to weekly, the price action on these timeframes will tell me whether or not it was a retracement trade or a breakout in the trend direction.  
  
**Retracement trade** -Close-_Short term trade_  
**Breakout in trend direction** \- I would let it ride-_medium to long-term trend_  
  
_**Take Profit-Closing Trades-Trade Management**_  
  
**Closing individual trades** \- works best if the price action is suggesting that the trend may likely change or you are satisfied with the current profits...  
**Managing** \- the stop-loss maybe place at the level where you feel most comfortable, should price retrace beyond that level (Previous tested resistance or support).   
**Closing as basket** -Is an option when you are strict about your daily targets, especially for the fact that opportunities  
present themselves everyday.  
**To comment on the Eurusd & Audusd**\- I am still negative on the two (2) pairs-Not sure what the outcome will likely be due to the pending US based data's to be released.  
Canadian data to be released right after.

It's pretty amazing that just awhile ago when I posted, I was positive for the day. I shifted the take profit of my orders that were near to individual take profit levels, wanting to do a basket take profit. But right now, the basket take profit was not reached and ended up as pretty negative for the day (CAD had a significant move due to and orange news). I wonder what should be the best trade management technique to take.

I had gotten stopped out at a little over break-even...If i had not deleted the opposite order it would have been triggered to be in profits instantly, however i was going on the road, so chose to be safe than sorry.

I was unable to be around my charts to properly manage my trades, i had to do a quick errand on the road. I had place all assets with stoploss above break-even, due to carrying trades into U.S. session. Under normal circumstances i would have closed all trades win or loss prior to open of the U.S. Session. However after data release of USD and Cad news the market started to move as a high impact news would have done for the market Aud started coming back towards breakeven as for the eurusd it remained out on a negative 18 to 25 pips region.

  1. **Gbpusd -Sell** \- Furthest 80 Pips currently at 56 pips
  2. **Gbpjpy- Sell** -Furthest 163 Pips Currently at 112 Pips
  3. **UsdJpy- Sell** -Furthest 40 Pips Close out at 7.50 pips
  4. **Eurjpy-Sell** -Furthest 54 Pips Closed at 10.6 pips
  5. **Audusd-Buy** -furthest in negative was-20 Pips at present negative 5 Pips
  6. **Eurusd-Buy** -furthest in negative was-30 Pips at present negative 19 Pips
  7. **Cadjpy-Sell** \- went into profit for 39 pips and got closed at 2 pips
  8. **AudJpy-Sell-** Went into profit for 24 pips and got closed at 1.5 pips
  9. **NzdJpy-Sell-** Went into Profit for 25 pips and got closed at 2.5 pips

  
Overall Profit would have been 300 pips with a surplus of 26 Pips. This goes to show that it is best to either take profit when target is met or place stoploss above target.  
  
What would be good as **Fanatics** had mentioned about **closing trade** s, is that a **basket monitor** , would work well**to monitor the account** in order to**close the trades when the 300 pips target is met** , or place stoploss at that level as a equity protection measure.  
The **original Concept was to take the best/most ideal 6 trades** for a target of 300 pips which would have been met today once more. Nevertheless nine trades were taken and the goal would have been met easily, especially by the **gbp pairs.**  
  
Today has been a good day for me...  
  
_**Questions for You**_

  1. I want to hear from those who tested the system?
  2. What was the experience like?
  3. If you were to adjust anything what would it be and why?

Ok sounds like you had a great day!   
I re-read your post on how you trade and realised I had some misinterpretation. Can I clarify that you look for a range ONLY between 7pm to 11pm your time? You ignore candles outside those time? Then you place your orders and that's it!

Post a picture of a breakout & share your thoughts. Whether you took the trade or not, only those who give will get. Share what you have learnt, like, seen, or want to understand.

This is great Fanatics, keep up the good work and i am sure life will be easier! We Just need Some added tools to either place the orders much easier or give alerts Like "Asset Below Normal adr" for Session Prior to ending of Session!

Thank you! Do you mean the current range is lower than average of the current session range over the last x days since we will not hit adr by end of Asian session normally?

So if the normal session is say usa- like usdjpy, usdcad- the average normal range is 80 pips for the sake of this example but during the present session it is below 1/2 of the amount like 30 or lower, we should be interested, right?  
We Would need an ADR Alert to say "asset currently below 1/2 of the normal range".   
Whether in dashboard format or something like that.

Your strength dash-Looks great CliffyC, the upload was fine, i will show you how to save the picture and or upload a screenshot only attachments.  
depending on your keyboard, whether you are using MAC, using windows, it all depends on if your printscreen key has any other function or not-you would have to press the "fn key" along with "Prt Sc", if the key only has "Prt Sc" it would be the only thing you press. Ensure that your screen is free from anything you do not want displayed in public, that is why editing is best done thereafter your screen shot, like cropping etc. But if you are fine the pictures will highlight what needs to be done.

So u are looking at something to alert you when a current session ends, if the session just ended is less than 1/2 of the average range of this session? This should be for all sessions instead of only Asian session?

First of all, Thanks for your session indicators. I always ignore what session is going on. with these indicators I know what markets I should trade. My favorite markets is London and New York.

This is great there is a trick to the session indicator and you have to be aware of this when it is winter versus summer, where the time is concerned.  
  
One begs to ask the question, PrinceJ58 what difference does the session make with my trading being successful, based on my expectations in trading volume.  
  
Be aware, Be found with knowledge. It is better to know something than to flow with the unknown, not every where the crowd goes, you should follow.

I like to price in after Asian session has ended. I got stopped out of eurnzd. Oops  
  
and let it trend if I can for London and New York session   
  
and ill use the csdash meter, when each session starts. To have a "feel"  
I remember reading somewhere here that Asian session always ranges. And trading away from the open of the day.

Yes! I feel this is a greed counter or like a feel on how many pips have reached.  
its like a rule. No more, no less, don't be greedy, trade another day.   
Once adr has reached.

Thank for your advices. I think shouldn't be an issue if the time discrepancy about winter vs summer is not too big. I will test before confirmation to use.

My friend it does affect it, the opening hours do change, so if you are use to trading the opening of a session you will either be 1 hour too early or too late.

It is the range that brings excitement to this system my friend. We are looking for ranges less than 1/2 of the daily range of the asset, most times this happens prior to news events which will push the market with high volume and volatility. This is required to move the market and bring your account good rewards for your educated decisions.

We Would need an ADR Alert to say "asset currently below 1/2 of the normal range". Whether in dashboard format or something like that.

here are the charts of the trades taken. I think from how the charts have progressed after I took profit, it is clear that there's more room before we should close to maximize profit. Is it adviseable to wait further or is it better to close out and go?  
  
Or are today's results just an extraordinary day of good profit? What's your experience after trading this strategy for so long? Is this kind of performance consistent and is it repeatable on a long term basis? Many thanks for sharing!!!  
  
Hope my charts will inspire more people

**Fanatics i like your charts** , as stated in post #8 i must say usually i would take profits **right before the New York open** , however if i want it to stay i would put a **stop-loss at break-even, close part of the trade position** or trail **closest to my 50 pips target**. Nevertheless i was always satisfied with before New York as **sometimes not always, price would retrace** if not **change trend direction**. In trading London open as the 1st post had suggested, sometimes there will be signs of **candles suggesting reversals,** whether it is a**bullish or bearish pin-bar/shooting star, morning star evening star.** Look out for those. Fanatics your charts had shown them clearly.  
  
**You closed out some of your trades too early** , look to see if right before New York opened would have brought more profits for the trades. Let see which ones would be more beneficial in terms of pips in our favour right before New York.  
  
From checking **your charts** displayed, out of 10 trades 3 retraced clear from the profits after to going to an extreme high or low and one had mixed signals-was a confused pair.

  1. **Gbpchf-** Good
  2. **Usdjpy** -Retraced-Reversal Pinbar
  3. **EurAud** -Good
  4. **Chfjpy** -Retraced-Reversal Pinbar
  5. **Gbpjpy** -Good
  6. **Eurjpy** -Retraced-Reversal Pinbar
  7. **Eurgbp** -Good-But gave you a panic
  8. **Audchf** -Good
  9. **Audcad** -Good
  10. **Eurusd-** Mixed Signals-Gave five (5) Reversal signals one in the middle, one close to new york open and one after the open.

That will be great Fanatics, looking forward to your results. If the trade does not hit stop loss, let it ride, most times i am sleeping and would be up just before New York open. Should your timezone allow you to up watching the trades you will panic or try to save the account- this is generally**the bait the market makers** use to **attract the fish towards** the bait-**your account funds is the fish**. If you are able to exercise patience and put emotions to sleep, that small fish will turn into a ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f433.png?v=15.1) **whale if you learn to nibble of the bait they set on the hooks.**  
  
When the**contract size** is in multiples of**3's or 4's** , the trades can be closed or scaled out in different sequences. Scaling out in quarters of the adr -1/4, 1/2, 3/4 and then leave the last 1/4 quarter to trail. **That would be a nice concept for an E.A.** Coders, my thoughts ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1).  
The reason is that on **different occasions price tends to continue** into the next session. Other times if it had the **breakout with the trend** , that last 1/4 of the open order would be great to ride the trend.  
  
Scaling out order size example below:  
  
**_Contract size for scaling out:_**  
**3=** 0.03, 0.06,0.09  
0.30, 0.60, 0.90  
3.00,6.00, 9.00  
  
**4=** 0.04, 0.08, 0.12  
0.40, 0.80, 1.20  
4.00, 8.00, 12.00  
  
  
Those big lots could work on the typical standard accounts, mini accounts and micro account. So you would use the account which is suitable for you.  
The micro accounts present a better risk management.

So do we try out other sessions like asian and New York when the session before is ranging? Meaning not just target trading London session? But when will we close the orders? Just like London, we close at the end of the session? But what would the correct range timings to look at for the different sessions? You have mentioned asian we look at gmt 12am to 4am. How about London and New York sessions?

Thank you. Ok let me share my results for today's demo. I followed your advice and only closed all orders just before new york close. Some hit my tp of RR = 1:2. Also had some stop losses. But overall it was a good day! Thanks for your sharing! Will love to learn more from you!

The complicated answer is:  
  
It's pretty simple my friend when the market is closed the session has less volumes unless strong correlations are in place with the USD. Check to see that each asset ranges at different times and still yield a breakout.  
  
The aim is not to lock yourself into just one session, or else we might just as well call it a London breakout. My daily timing is intertwined with US seasion, so I would go to work and when I get home US session is closed but I still want to trade so I would still look for opportunities over Asian session to be enabled during London.  
  
If I want to sleep I have to create a strategy that can allow me to sleep yet still be in a trade when there are high volumes presented in the market.  
  
For this system to work all the trader needs to do is to find that pair that is acting up. The pair is like a child if they not playing, giving some form of trouble, being up and about, then something must be wrong, so as parent's both persons would want to know if everything is OK and would do anything to make it right. So they would sit on both ends of the bed-two pending orders to buy or sell.  
  
Sometimes a pair will range the entire day, across all sessions! In an all day ranging scenario you would be shocked to know that London did not trigger the order? Oh the system doesn't work! No my friend, it is the fundamental activities that is the driving force. Breakouts take place even in Asian session.  
  
You learnt using one session, now the eagle pushes out the eaglets and say fly. They have to, this is thousands of feet/meters above ground level they almost in the sky already. So if they just adjust themselves with those strong wings, to try and stay alive the wind will pick them up and they will glide in the wind.  
  
This is the reason for the cheat sheet. Each asset ranges based on the news that is due to be released in their trading business day. It is for us to be informed and look for those opportunities as they arise. As you will now observe in your charts, you will realise that breakouts do take place in every session.  
  
Cheers!

The results today have said alot...Hmm is it profitable or not?  
In going through 23 assets which include Gold, Silver and Wti, I have excluded CHF-Margin and spread requirements versus per pip payout.

CadJpy-Tricky Pair but we still had a breakout plus reversal. This one has strong influences from being an Oil/energy driven pair.

Should your timezone allow you to up watching the trades you will panic or try to save the account- this is generally the bait the market makers use to attract the fish towards the bait-your account funds is the fish.

I understand the reason to ride the trend. But I also feel that sometimes, it's better to take the profit and go? You never know what will happen the next moment. So it's clear for Asian session what time we look for a range. What about London and NY sessions? What are the exact times we should look for to find the range? This would help in filling up the cheat sheet.

In answering your question, most**news items come at the start, or mid way the time of the session**... so once there is a **range for the previous session,** look to **place the orders before the ranging session ends**.  
  
I **mentioned** a **particular time** due to the fact that i usually have a **preferred time to go to bed**. My trading hours and availability are also tied to my daily schedule to factor in **work, sleep, travel, family time**. Systematic way of living- routine standards.   
  
News data example found below were all in the start of the new session or midway.

Dear friend, may I ask for winter is 1 hour later and now summer 1 hour earlier e.g. nov & march it different as US and Europe switch daylight savings on different dates. On broker platform If you count the bar say from 00.00 it will be the same with the acceptations in nov & march. e.g. London open is bar 10 from 00.00 as brokers platform adjust the 00.00 time to start earlier in summer. Pls correct me if I am wrong love your input on this TQ

This I how I traded yr strategy, Suggestion (range detection from (00.00 to 07.00) break on (08.00 / 09.00 / 10.00) if no break wait next session (next day) rule range must be in a certain pips high low (e.g. 35 pips) tp1 161.8 tp2 261.8 (order 2 to be when order 1 hit tp) start 07.00 with a buy stop & sell stop order to trigger n delete the previous.  
An upgrade can be included later to recover from false break. regards (Different pairs other characteristic)

It is customary for the UK to observe Day light Saving Time (DST) from **March to October** every year. However, a lot of people are not aware of this, which leads to mistakes even in trading. Should you follow well know Trading fundamentally driven company's like Bloomberg, Reuters and others you will be updated when these changes are made. Hence no need to worry.   
  
GMT is said to be the standard time zone for places like Ireland and the United Kingdom, which also includes other places like England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. These countries use DST during a certain part of the year, but utilizing different names.  
The **United Kingdom** and its **Crown dependencies** use British Summer Time (BST) during the DST period. BST does not apply to the **British Overseas Territories** , like the British Virgin Islands and or Gibraltar.  
  
In **Ireland** , the DST time zone is called Irish Stand Time (IST) quite unique to them. This is also referred to as the Irish Summer Time. So therefore both BST and IST would be considered one hour ahead of GMT during these times.  
  
So for clarity the only European country which stays on GMT all year is Iceland.  
  
Therefore for the system to function right all the time you have to be aware of these technicalities and never miss out when you hope to trade.  
There for during the summer, from around 3:00 am -4:00 am EDT, the Tokyo session & the London session will experience an overlap. While, during both summer and winter from 8:00 am-12:00 pm ET, the London session and the New York session will experience their overlap.  
  
_Est in other words really stands for Eastern Standard Time, While EDT refers to Eastern Daylight Time._  
  
The reality is that EST is usually used for six months of the year, and EDT is utilized for the other six months of the year. During the months of Daylight Savings Time which is said to be March 8th to November 1st, though it varies from year to year. Does it really matter you ask?

This idea is basically implementing what i consider to be a **customized fibs, which incorporates the 123 pattern** with **fib retracement and extensions into one tool** , using the **extension as take profits** in accordance with the level of pullback being #2 in the 123 system: whether #2 is the 38.2, 50 or 61.8 retracement level which would also determine the likely take profit levels found at 161.8, 261.8 and 423.6 extension levels for Take Profit zones, Really clever.

Can this indicator be upgrade to fit out strategy...  
It should reflect mm session.  
The main concern here is ADR that is Less than Half of the Daily Average range of an asset.

The next move is to combine the necessary information needed to trade this strategy into one PDF or word document to make this easier.  
  
The idea is that this strategy works across all volatile assets, across all sessions. The driving force behind this system is the ranges found leading up to the upcoming session with medium to high impact news, yes fundamental data releases. This system is aimed at capitalizing on breakouts both ways for some pairs. Hence we need two pending orders. Pin bars, morning and evening stars inclusive of other reversal bars are common scenarios found at resistance / support zones.  
  
Most of the high volume pairs are GBP pairs which has high ADR's of over 100 pips per day.  
So one can choose 6 pairs everyday and possibly get 300-400 plus pips easily. Yesterday is an exception.   
Not to mention wti, gold and silver. To trade the commodities is very risky though.   
  
So as long as the pair is operating less than 1/2 of the ADR in pip range, we should be interested. Tight ranges suggest pending breakout.  
  
  
Ranges may also be traded. Whoever is seriously interested in helping with this coding will get added information necessary to cover all aspects of the market. A real set and forget expert advisor based system.

Soldier why should we kill the heart beat of the system my Friend, You have to be Hungry...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1) Show no fear or mercy, if you do in the end you will feel like you had just stepped into a deep hole. In this war you can never give up, surrender or back down. You got to let the system prove itself, if your fearful try it on a demo, it should not hurt.  
  
Micro accounts are good for testing too.

**In filling out the cheat sheet, use:**

  1. the H1 timeframe to look back more than 1 month or more for ranges and input the maximum range that yields a profitable breakout
  2. where ADR is concerned input the one for maximum period, yesterday does not count- try 108 days-results.
  3. Look for the session it ranges in and input the information under the column. 

**N.B. Through this process this will allow you to be in sync with the strategy, where by you will be able to identify the best time to trade a particular asset, remember to share.**

For the basics, you can try this, but there are sites and course that are available. If you want to get somewhere it is nice to ask questions but also good to read a map.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

Hmm I only have four trades triggered today. And all ended up as losses. I had sells for gbpcad, gbochf, gbpusd, buy for cadchf. I traded the Asian range only. Princej58, your trades were those you listed earlier?

Thanks for taking the effort to open a demo to show us. You mentioned about collating all information to one document. Will you be doing it? I think it would really help us to be aware of the exact rules and nuances. Example trade management, moving stop loss to breakeven, taking profit on ads etc Once the document is done we can follow it to code which would make it easy to follow

That's great! Thanks.cant wait to start work on this. Yes the retracement is really wicked. So we must have a good trade management method so that we don't give up our profits easily

Actually Wicked to those who don't pay attention, there are traders who concentrate on different scenarios:

  1. Reversals
  2. Trend Trading
  3. Fundamental-News releases
  4. Breakouts
  5. Etc

If we code an ea for this strategy, it's not going to be easy to detect such reversals.

I died because of the recersal  
there must be something I'm not getting right yet.  
besides getting stopped out, I got slippage loss from it too. Hmmm  
interesting  
  
should markets like certainty, this explains the pause in direction.  
makes me further.   
Mill learn from this mpc bank rate event.  
i was shorting into GBPUSD and gbpaud   
both reversed. And got stopped with slippage.  
  
im thiking of doing a limit order away from the box. Something like a hit and go and take profit before such "high risk" events take place

Does trading Asian range and London session and closing before us session work?  
  
in addition to these rules here.  
im trying to be as conservative and capital preservative as possible.  
  
i notice the pairs I like eg euraud eurnzd and gbpaud gbpnzd doesn't trend into the us session  
  
and I do count the average daily range for the pair too. To keep me safer.   
  
this approach of the rules stated helps me stay green ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Fanatics, I was in similar situation as you. Feeling gbpaud and GBPUSD and gbpcad  
they were green from Asian to London session and in came news and it reversed.  
  
mistake learnt for me - yes breakout, least aside, I entered the London session late. And didn't get the chance to break even. Ouch

The initial breakout would have been in profits...  
Should the stop loss be moved to break-even all would be well.   
  
This situation happens to me at times when i don't follow the rule. Like the other day-Monday if i had not moved the stop losses i would have also incurred a loss as well.

I did not use oco, as i have had experience where both side breaking out would yield good profits. As stated in the past, OCO has its good and it has its bad- This is one of them, so i have been leaning towards leaving the other one.  
The trades have to be managed in these situations though.

An easy way to know is to look back at 1 to 2 hours before us session opens and 15-30 minutes before.  
Either it reverses on the open or there is big push in favour of the trade direction.

The next **thread** I will start will **focus** on what i think could likely be a very profitable scalping technique once optimized correctly.  
Or should I keep it a secret hmm. There have been a lot of takers, Casper's (ghost-followers) recently on this thread versus givers and supporters. I will sleep on it.

A below its average Asian session range move base on cheat sheet ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
it should be 60pips for Asian range for gbdusd

I think that is about correct in terms of acceptable range limit and the 180 day ADR was around 160 don't remember off the top of my head. Its in my cheat sheet though.  
  
It allows you to subtract the 60 pips leaving you with a possible move if 120 pips on average. So I'd price should breakout in one direction without any reversals/ change of trend, then expect that kinda move. Otherwise the smaller the better. The only trick to it sometimes it breaks both directions when the range is really small, price may break & reverse throughout the actual trading day.  
  
Oh I almost forgot to mention that it really is nice to see you add some flavour to the mix...nice ma's. I hope it helps you.

Been a busy work day so no time to check out here. If u r referring to gbpusd, I guess reason is the upcoming usd red news in about one hour? Plus 8t has been ranging the whole of today.  
  
Just reporting my demo results today. Poor... Had many stop loss trades. current open positions are green but overall for the day is very negative. Will not close my positions and will let them run till new york session.

I have to ask, why are some people saying Friday trading is optional?   
Is there any detailed effects that affect this?  
like options expirations always on Friday?  
  
this has been something I been wandering.

Should give you excitement... Can't know unless you try. I feel you are a safe trader that will wait for the breakout then enter.

What about scaling out of a trade? You still bank something on that balance and move SL to break even.

thats so funny. yes my personality is reflected in way I press the mouse. I realize trading reflects alot of myself.  
I like to wait for the breakout and count the daily range, and also break even +2.  
Making it slow like a marathon and not a race.

I beg to ask the question if you were a swing/positional trader, observing only daily to monthly charts and holding trades based on that condition would you get in and out of trades? Hmmn

Yes the calmer the better, it geives me time to put orders on both sides and it doesnt retrace and eat into the stop loss.  
Im thinking of gbpnzd and gbpusd for the us session

I made a pole for the reason that we could help each other in figuring out how to approach methods best for their trading preferences.  
So if you wouldn't mind in sharing your idea of what you want and look for. I will use it as an example. Probably the silent traders will speak then.

Yes I do use SL TO BE or Trailing Stop on all my trades as I think FX is an illusion like a magic show and instead of being a spectator it’s better to learn the magic and be the magician ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f600.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f643.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/2615.png?v=15.1)

Now about Coding...Fanatics and others... there are several existing E.A.'s on the market which reflect similar details and could be modified to reflect the differences in this strategy to begin with , but what if an indicator is developed like the one i have posted, it would help us to see what are the best parameters to implement.

I can take a look at the code. How do you want it to be modified?

I like capital preservation. like a +2 and brreak even, it feels good to look at it hehe.  
Instead of a bad stop loss.  
  
At times, it just goes against me and eats me out when i do the BE. Ill just reenter. But if its too far from the open of the day. Ill stop it.  
I learnt to trade another day. Greed kills =D

Hey Prince,  
  
I like the idea you're working with. When I first began looking into trading Forex I investigated that indicator and it looked very promising, but utilizing the logic you've added with the sessions, news, etc... it would almost have to work even better. The programmer/coder is Sqaulou: <https://www.forexfactory.com/squalou>   
  
The original premise behind the strategy was that the market creates consolidation areas that it returns to periodically. There were some guys on 'Forexhard's' thread (the guy who thought of it) that did well, even without the indy.  
  
I think all you'd have to do is to restrict the indicator to only calculate consolidation areas at certain times and prior to major news announcements, or include options for one or both criteria in the existing code. That way you could easily test your strategy for as far back as you want.

Almuten, You are indeed spot on with your analysis, I had used "London Breakout v.9" with helping me to spot good ranges across all pairs quickly, In doing my cheat sheet that is a great tool-hint hint.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1) I did Asian session first, then london, and finally New York yes a hint for all of you. With that i want to see attachments of cheat sheets. Keep it simply & effective. The feature i like that squalou added was the no trade zone which also highlights the possible ADR or breakouts.  
  
There are ways to trade ranges and breakouts separate and a part from the main rules stated in this thread, which are secretively hidden but yet obvious, yes in this thread they are hidden. If there is no range and price had already moved too far, there are also ways to trade those scenarios but i am limited to say such until the thread develops some more. Limited for the fact that it is rather unfair to the few active participants which i can count on one hand to work so hard and the silent followers all benefit. I think the rest are either just starting their trading journey or have had years of ups and downs and looking for a viable option. Still say Something, it means a lot, it helps me to evaluate their situation and better help them and others.  
  
Yes this thread is very helpful even for me. Looking forward to more from you. The more shared by like minds, the better the explosive rewards will be.  
  
Cheers!

Precisely... To earn $$$$, I believe it is possible once you have an edge, sniper precision and the discipline in cutting out winning trades out of the larger market like a surgeons knife.

Is EA that automatically opens positions according to this indicator? Long trades only / short trades only.

Well this is the thing, i am not an excellent coder. I am an inquisitive and outside the box strategy and system developer. I can scan your system and trade pattern to make a system or strategy better.  
  
This indicator/not E.A. is a visual display of the results of a trading strategy/system the look it has is what i love so if someone could add time inputs that would be great. It is a good platform to start other than London breakout v.9.2

GbpJpy above would have triggered a breakout both ways from Monday to Tuesday, following the rules of stop-loss you'd be in profit, the pair gave out at-least 50 pips-Monday, Tuesday it gave the least 100 pips both ways.  
There are assets and days that will only go in one direction on the break, buy do open your mind to these scenarios.  
One can make considerable amount of cash in no time with this method if traded properly.  
Only those who see the light will be able to take a bite.

I will be posting a review of the pairs...It will be good if others participate and tell me their experience, if they had the guts/belief in the system.  
Is it too hard?  
Too Easy?  
Something not clear enough?  
Yes you can trade everyday, so instead of just 1200 pips you can possibly get up to 1500 pips easily per week with just 6 successful trades per day giving out the least 50 pips.

1\. With 16 profitable trades over 14 session i could retire if i aim for 5% account growth.  
2\. With 224 good trades aiming at 5% for could do it.  
  
Which one is easier, finding the trades or the building the strategy that will guarantee the profits?

ForexFactory and the internet are fulled with this type's of dreams. Search FF with "5 pips a day" and you will see many pipedreams. Somehow Price Action quashes every dream flat.  
  
Yes, it is possible to take $100 to $1 000 000 000.

Aren't you right, you see one can have a great strategy and a great attitude but if you don't have good management of the account this can lead to bad endings. Providing protection yet risking enough at the right time to receive, this can be the edge required to accomplish the target. I have experienced both wins and losses but some of us don't think we should experience losses and this can be the mindset to our accounts grave.  
  
The hardest part of the journey is the starting. If one can start right and maintain the displine to stick to the plan one can make it.  
For me I won't always stick to the plan, I usually deviate but those moments when I stick to only the plan, the sky becomes limitless with space to enjoy and capture my goals. Over and over again.  
  
So i find that there things we need to identify and work on in order to jump over this hurdle in life. Its always the start that is hard and maintaining the displine to stick to it. This is why I have opted for automation so much.

Hey there, just a little gift as I took an idea from your thread to add to my dash.  
  
It constantly checks for breakouts in all major/minor 28 pairs involving EUR/CHF/GBP/JPY/AUD/NZD/CAD/USD in the current session vs the previous.  
  
AustralAsian checks for breakouts vs the previous day, European session vs AustralAsian session, Overlap session vs European session and US session vs Overlap session. (AA session is 17:00-02:59 NY time, EP session is 03:00-07:59 NY time [not including Frankfurt], Overlap session is 8:00 to 10:59 NY time and clear US session is 11:00-16:59 NY time [added the final extra hour for simplicity]).  
  
BD=Breakout Down, BU=Breakout Up, IN=Inside previous range.  
  
I am not trading breakouts, but they are useful for me to watch as I trade currency baskets.

I will surely be testing this, _**"SAKISF"**_ Thanks for your input, i look forward to bigger collaborations with you and others as i build on this system with the knowledge gained over time. Its funny this system is so powerful i am afraid of it like a big dream and you have added to this system.  
I am expecting some big movements in the markets from London session onward through out New York as the calendar depicts .  
Look on the reaction from those ranges yesterday over the Asian Session. This trading day will have a lot more pairs involved, the CAD is not mentioned but look for movement in that pair due to the oil news.

Good thread Prince. It is great to see people that are genuinely interested in just helping people learn. I have traded a similar strategy for awhile now with good results. But nowhere as good as yours. I also only aim for 10 pips a trade. I don't have much time, like you. I work a full time job, many times working 12-16 hour days and sometimes no days off. I found a similar strategy that I could sit down for about 30 mins a night, place pending trades, and go to sleep. It took some analyzing to find the perfect time to watch for the breakouts that would generally work for my schedule, since I don't have time to manage trades at all. It is very nice waking up to trades that have open, closed, and taken profit. I am following your thread and hope to see more.

**Based on where you are located this strategy may also work for you, Test it on demo or use low leverage trades-(smallest lot size) on your real trading account, this is the way to get your provider to be broker, especially when you target the market with a plan.**  
**The great opportunity that was ahead for yesterdays range prior to the breakout, sigh look on Eur/Usd.**  
**Any account would have surely grown. That is just one asset of which i was interested in. I wont fill the page with countless trades, EUR/USD is more than Enough!**

There will be several opportunities in this session.  
Remember  
all trades taken is viewed like a basket, you can trail above break-even or close all before New York, New York will come with its fair share of volatility and we wont be sure of where the market will send it so its best to protect and get stopped in profits.

You know i thought about persons with this condition, but did not know which colour or shades to use preferably, the colour is grey.  
Tell me the colours best to use if any that is so you can see easily.

Working on a way to get rid of those situations of being stopped out only to see price continue after a retracement.  
All Trades Triggered-**Personal Thought-** **(Written out here):** Some people say you cannot depend on only one strategy and i agree with them however, you can trade one strategy from different angles... and still reach success.  
If you placed these trades according to guidelines of 10-15 pips away from the box and stop-loss on the opposite side, some trades would have been triggered and you would have know the direction of the remaining trades, i will never give my bias here, i will share my idea but not give out Concrete trade recommendations- as signal. I am not a signal provider, i have only shared the assets that are of interest so that you too can look to see why and what to look for and i will not do so for too long.

  1. Audcad
  2. Cadjpy-Stopped out of a buy,
  3. Euraud
  4. EurJpy
  5. Nzdcad
  6. Eurusd
  7. Gbpusd-stopped out of a sell
  8. Euraud
  9. UsdJpy- stopped out of a buy, the other one triggered, not sure thats the right direction though but lets see. Jpy has been weak from the starting of the week, i have a Jpy basket monitoring-testing something.

grey looks visable to me. Green and red looks almost similar. Yellow is hard too as it seems reflective (oops)

There is an issue with the stop-loss placement at the other end of the box for tight ranges. Most times when a trade gets stopped out, its the algos taking advantage of the pockets in the market, as traders use support and resistance for the targets and stops. So i was wondering if the stop-loss could be placed at a recent resistance forming on h1 time-frame using fractals for short orders and recent supporting fractals for the long orders when the boxes are really tight like Eurusd yesterday even though it just went in one direction no look-back. Wishing it was easy like that all the time, lol.

Hi PrinceJ58! I'm interested in learning your trading method. Just to make it clear do you put your pending orders 10-15 pips away from Asia session range? If so then I guess the indi "Breakout Lvls" already does the job indicating the buy/sell level yes? Anyway I will try trading your method on my demo account ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1). Keep up the good work mate! Cheers!

I wanted to go ahead and post here as well. Please let me know what you think, and what you would like to see different. I am currently modifying it to include an option to choose a 4 or 5 digit broker. If you do not think that is necessary, just let me know. Thank you.

Directional Bias indicators are good on higher time frame for trade direction bias, For the new template if price is above the 50 ema on h1 to daily look to place buy stop orders. If price is below on h1 to daily look to place sell stop order.

What happens on one may happen on the rest as well due to correlation.

So look on higher time frame and see what will happen to trades that are setting up for you. Post your screenshots and possible setups, that's the only way to know if your are on the right track. If you found something that may help others with there trades don't hesitate to share.  
  
  
Cheers.

Hi Prince,  
Ive been lurking in the background and followed eveyones post since it started, ive been trialing your trading system now (without using money just simply plotting where i would buy/sell) ive had some good results, i would have made 156 pips in two days which isnt bad at all, i missed the AUD news but going off my calculations and using your system that would have raked around 600 pips on the AUD pairs, now my question is, has there been a method put into place to prevent being stopped out on reversals? such as a trailing stop loss so we can lock in profits if so how many pips would you advise to set this at?, Also i see you set up your buy and sell points during the asian range, which sometimes will trigger off buy or sell level with out breaking out then potentially be stopped out before news is released, working off the 15 minute chart would it not be easier to set up both buy and sell levels say 30 minutes before the news is due to be released and mitigate the risk of an order being triggered too early?   
  
Sorry for the bad spelling it isnt my strong point!   
Just wondering on your thoughts and anyone else's point of view on that.  
  
Kindest regards   
Neil

**Thanks for stopping by, Spelling is the least of our problems. Now i am happy you replied, and you made good observations. The thing about being triggered too early has been an issue for sometime now., which is why we used the pips away as buffer. The thing that i mentioned before was with the new template was using h1 or h4 for placing stop-loss above fractal in a sell and placing stop below fractal in a buy situation. This has been safe enough so far.**  
  
**There are ways to add directional bias and that is to observe higher time-frames such as the h4 for direction strong breakouts, breakouts i find tend to go with the major trend.**  
  
**Have you realized that sometimes the first breakout direction sometimes work out getting stopped out only to go back in that direction-Stop hunting.**  
  
**In terms of capitalizing on the pips you can use trailing stop, trail behind a moving average, trail behind fractals-support and resistance and you can close the trades at the end of each session no matter what. Which in our case is before newyork opens.**  
  
**AUD news was an excellent representation of the system, eurusd and gbpusd lastweek.**  
**I have been doing some messing around with keep the trades from the first breakout experienced on the Monday London session for the week.**  
**Observe that method and let me know, especially when the strengths/currency exposure is present in supporting the direction.**  
  
**As for the 30 minutes before news, that can be safe enough, usually there is activity from the this time leading up. But observe the spread from this 30 minute point on-wards.**

Projection and outlook on the safe havens.  
Try and see what the outlook and projections could likely go for some weeks into months.

Prince,  
Sorry i know your getting loads of questions here, i understand you close your positions before the NY open, how does this effect you if you was planning on trading RED news on USD pairs? would you still place your buy/sell levels during the asian range and wait for the US Session to kick in or do you still place trades on USD pairs during asian range and close them before NY opening. Just confused as to my understanding if your closing before NY session your not going to catch the news from the US on the USD pairs thus missing the potential breakout, how do you skin this cat?

**The cat usually gets trapped whenever it is sleeping. So b depending on the assets conditions during a session will determine when it breaks.**

  1. **Let's say the ranges is over Asian session I would expect a London breakout.**
  2. **If its a London range I expect a New York breakout.**
  3. **If its a New York range I expect breakout in Asian.**

  1. **So with that being said I skin the cat while it's hot in the breakout session.**
  2. **So if the session coming up has the breakout I take profits in that same session or move my stoploss to an acceptable profit level I am not willing to give up and trail the rest.**

**I hope I have answered your question.**

Some assets like gbpnzd probably still safe at 70 pips, as they give out like 180 or more pips on a breakout.

Of course there are some trouble makers, as this trigger was different from the breakout strategy. so i am in profit but not in the way the above looks...  
  
This is early times for the analysis of these trades anyways. They are being taken from high time-frame signals.

Prince,  
Can you shed some light on how you choose where to place your buy/sell orders as in the above charts, the old way worked where you was doing 10-15 pips from either side of the range box however this way your catching alot more pips. Now looking at your charts i cant for the life of me figure out how you selected those buy/sell lines, sometimes they pass through fractuals sometimes they seem to be in the center of the range.  
  
kindest regards   
Neil

Those are research driven trades my friend. It sparks an interest in me too. Did the same on a demo and held those trades for more than two weeks so i want to see how things work out here.

Got caught out today, made 260 (sorry edited 26 pips) pips on USD/CAD but EUR/USD let me down triggered both buy and sell and went back into he range, hmmmm maybe i should have set a trailing stop of 10 Pips would have locked in profits either way then, lesson learnt i guess, still on a buy on NZD/USD see what happens.

Really nice trades,  
Can i ask what made you trade GBP currencies and CAD currencies? did you not take trades on the Red news from the US? final question, did you use the same principle to set up you buy sell levels or did you use your reasearch method.  
  
Kindest regards

The way i have taken your trading method is as follows,  
  
First ill see what RED news is up and coming so today for example it was USD  
due to looking to trade RED US news id check my USD pairs for a range in the London session of up to around 50 pips  
id then set up my buy/sell levels based on 10 pips from the range and place my SL at support and Resistance of the range.  
Id set up my take profit of a 2:1  
  
This is what i have been doing, now can you be so kind and guide me through another crystal clear way as before in how i use Higher time frame analysis and currency strength and how i incorrporate that into my trading method. if you can also see anything im doing wrong as stated above please can you let me know?  
  
Just abit confused as to how you plot that outlook projection and how its used, sorry for being a pain in the bum im just trying to learn lol   
  
Kindest regards  
Neil.

Trust me you are no pain, lol, oh lord.  
For Strengths, what i do is look on the Currency exposure on Sunday/Monday trading week open and i look to see what is strong and which is weak.  
For the strong ones i am looking to go up with them.   
  
**Example Cad is strong**  
  
Eurcad-Sell  
USdcad-Sell  
Cadjpy-Buy  
Gbpcad-Sell  
NzdCad-Sell  
CadCHf-Buy  
AudCad-Sell  
  
So if its starting the pair i'm looking to buying and if its ending in the pair i am selling.  
The opposite for the Weak Index  
  
**This week Gbp- being weak**  
  
Gbpusd, -sell  
Gbpjpy-sell  
EurGbp-buy  
GbpCad-sell  
Gbpnzd-sell  
Gbpaud-sell  
Gbpchf-sell  
  
I have made stupid choices even in the same explained above, yes but its a learning process to choose between all the knowledge locked up in the brain that is escaping now.  
For eg. i should be selling gbpusd, but instead i am buying-Only the one above knows why, lol and i am buying gbpjpy, So to say the least it does not always correlate in all cases.  
This information is all to another thread by itself and i gave you a sneak peak here.  
  
No its saying usd and jpy weak. kinda confusing-to just follow the strengths. You would be selling when you need to be buying.

Will do!!  
ill start uploading my charts from next week.  
Even with my losses i still ended up in profit this week, (well if i had used money) ive got a A4 note pad stating where my entries are and my stop losses. Next week im going to tweak this method youve been so kind to provide us with and see how that compares to this week.  
  
All ill be doing is setting my BUY level just slightly above the most highest Fractual within the range id be observing and the opposite for SELL being at the lowest fractual of the range, i wont plot these points until 1 hour before news is released on a 15 minute chart. My stop loss will be set at 10 pips away from my chosen entries weather that be a buy or a sell (meaning they will be within the range box rather than at resistance or support) and ill also have a trailing stop of 13 pips. ill post my charts from next week along with pictures of my trading journal and let you know how i get on.  
  
Kindest Regards  
Neil

**So like for today with Aud/usd and Gold, how would those rules fair out, the system would be stopped out in both directions. Life!**  
**Still go ahead as i really would like to see different point of views.**  
  
**This is the shake out method that the market makers and big boys play, which is why i mentioned using h1/h4 for setting stoploss with the help of fractals- which represent recent support-buy or resistance-sell.**

Scalping, Medium term- long-term, strength trading and 123 reversal and continuation.  
This represent all three threads in one system. Which is why i say it doesn't matter which way you choose as long as it is systematic and repetitive.

So quite rightly we would have been stopped out like you said, the Buy was triggered and price rose too 20pips due to the news at 13:30 UK time, it then dropped now if we had a trailing stop of 13 pips we would have banked 7 pips (granted its not alot but like you said some traders only need 10 pips a day and too get 7 pips from 1 trade is good) i think this technique will work well when the news breaksout but the market comes back in to the same range as it does here, we still bank profit, as you can see a Sell was not triggered, now on USD/CAD price just drops and drops and drops this technique would still work as you know. I just found that today my trades that were triggered on the news where stopped out as price pulled back into the range, thats my reason for the trailing stop of 13 pips because even if price did what it did today upon news we still bank profit, using this technique today id have banked 40 pips despite two of my trades being stopped out, thats the reason for the trailing stop. The reason for my buy sell levels using fractuals i was finding that having a buffer of 10-15 pips wasnt really generating me that much pips on a reversal breakout trade (trade that breaks out then reverses against me) if i could find away to get into the trade earlier id be able to bank more pips with my trailing stop.  
The reason for 1 hour before the news is because i found that the range is some what set in stone then and that there majority of the time wont be another fractual painted that is higher than the previous highest fractual or lower than the previous lowest fractual of the range.  
  
Ive not fully tried this out like i said i was just thinking of different ways to which i could bank pips in situations like today where market broke out to both sides and then came back into a range, but also a method that would still work if market broke out to one side.  
  
Please feel free to share your thoughts prince you have much more expirence than my self at trading ill give this a go on a demo account next week and see how i get on.  
  
Sorry just to add on, where my chart says "BUY STOP" and "SELL STOP" these are my stop loss postions.  
  
Kindest regards  
Neil

Again stopped out however both buy and sell where triggered i had a sell which would give me 8 pips and a buy which gave me 25 pips 33 pips in total. Granted your method made more pips, but still 33 pips for one trade as we both know is really good.  
  
Thoughts?  
  
The thing im struggling with is when to trade gold and silver for breakout, the Red news is my trade indicator for that currency but what do i do or use to show me that gold and silver will potentially breakout.

Learn something new everyday.  
ill trial this tweaked method and see how it works out, the only problem i can see is like on the gold for example there is much more pips to be generated. maybe i can find a away to incorporate a rule for a re-entry?

Prince,  
Ive been studying these charts and this is what ive come up with for a Re-entry, please let me know if you or anyone else following this thread can see any discrepnsies with this, i dont mind some one saying its a rubbish idea or a good idea but please give your reasons why so we can develop this method of trading. This only works when there is a clear trend, and the reason for this is just to squeeze an extra few pips from our breakout trade after we finally get stopped out using our 13 pip trial stop.  
  
1.Ensure clear trend weather that be up or down, and check we where stopped out on a 13 pip trailing stop loss  
2.Wait for price to pull to the 6 EMA line.  
3.For sell enter when the next candle closes below 6 EMA after it was pulled back too the EMA(candle sticks should below the ema)  
4.For buy is the opposite enter once price pulls to 6 EMA line and the next candle has closed above the 6 EMA  
5 Exit will be once a candle closes above EMA on a sell, and below EMA on a buy.  
  
Re-entry is also made a stronger confirmation if it sits on a support or resistance line  
  
This is a re-entry method for my tweaked version of prince trade strategy please read that post before trying this.  
  
Thankyou again to prince for sharing his method with us.  
  
Kindest regards  
Neil

**Neil this is an interesting catch on this strategy, i would love to see how it plays out. You could check the 6 ema on higher time-frames too. I prefer 9 though.**

Yeah its been interesting studying this method, waiting on the CAD news tomorrow to place my first lot of trades so ill see how it plays out!  
I also noticed that you should only take a re-entry if there has been less than two pull backs anything more and the market seems to just try and sort itself out after the surge from the news.

For some experiment:   
Add EMA 200, 50, 9 to the chart observe the direction on h1-h4 timeframe for direction bias.  
Look for price to break in that direction and lets see if we eliminate the false breaks to the opposite side.  
The only thing that will be a challenge is if there is a trend change.  
  
Next thing:  
Try MACD 12, 26, 9 or any other periods to see if it can help with entry.  
RSI 14- above 50 uptrend and below 50 downtrend on h1, h4.  
  
Entry and stoploss:  
Entry 10-15 pips just the same  
Take profit Minimum should be 50 Pips  
Stoploss should be below the last h4 lower fractal for a buy and above the last 4 hour for a sell.  
  
  
Lets play around these parameters to see if we can pick up some similarities to the long runners.  
  
Cheers.

So then,  
i was entered in to 5 currencies with 7 trades  
AUD/USD, USD/CHF USD/JPY GBP/CAD USD/CAD  
  
I would have entered more CAD trades but i had to go to work grrr  
The results i got are as followed  
All trades won bar USD/JPY where i was stopped out on both buy and sell triggers, these hit my stop loss off 10 pips.  
Due to using a demo account i thought id also see how i got on with out setting a solid stop loss and just a trailing stop which all my trades won my trailing stop was 13 pips if my broker allowed it any more than 13 pips i would set to the brokers miniumum which was different from pair to pair id aim for a 13 pip stop though.  
  
Including my Loss and not including commission if i have done the maths correctly from very little lots as you can see i gained 21.23 Profit 26.53 (without commission) which is around 53 pips not too bad especially using small lots.  
  
The JPY let me down using 0.13 of a lot from hitting a solid stop loss on both buy and sell costing 10.01 EUR each way, now do i get rid and just use a trailing its looking that way lets see what tomorrow's news brings.

i was getting stopped out slightly early despite being in profit, think ill adjust my trailing to 18 pips to give the trade space to breathe, i also found if the news is going to make huge movements such as CAD my broker tends to set a min for my trailing stop GBP/CAD was at 20 pips as min trailing stop, that could be used as a indicator.

Trial and error!  
Ill be trying again today on Demo of course on the USD news just with a trailing stop of 16-18 pips unless dictated by the broker  
  
On silver, gold, and oil what range do we look for with regards to them i understand on the currencies its up to a range of 50 but unsure on the commodoties.

Hello Prince58,  
  
  
could you explain me why some mq4 files seems not to work ?  
  
I have created a brain new chart and the attempted to load all the indicators mentionned of your former thread:  
  
GBP Breakout.mq4 and London_breakout_for_EA does not get into the chart.  
  
Could you be more explicit about the 2 EMA canals you have on this screenshot please ? [https://www.forexfactory.com/attachm...1&d=1499875881](https://www.forexfactory.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=2394421&d=1499875881)  
  
The idea is to get into positions when the red curve cross the yellow one ?  
  
To sell at the top of a daily range and buy at the bottom ?  
  
Thanks for your kind precisions.  
  
LS

so i made profit today manage to bag 137 euro after a loss of 200 EUR and odd on one trade, i just held the postion on GBP/USD and Silver till it went into decent profit before US close which was quite intense! Despite using a demo account.  
  
The red news from the US didn't break out as much as i wanted it too it was fairly poor, so this made me think well i should be trading the red news but just what red news is the important news which will make movements, sure Central bank rate decisions is one but just what else is there.  
  
Maybe you could clear this up prince????  
  
I still made profit today so all is good but today i think was more down to luck than technique.

Some of the files are indicators, some are Expert advisors. I am not even sure if all that i have posted here or other threads work, since i was searching for things that look similar to what i wanted in an expert advisor, the closes to the logic is one created by squalou, his authorised breakout system is the closes i see.  
Ok well the yellow Ema 12 is used for trailing- when you observe you charts the next time, if you should be in a trade long-which of the ema functions would you use for buy versus sell, look on how close the candle comes to the line and also think about the bid and ask price- spread, will it be the high, close or low? And don't forget why? Now for the red ema 50 it is used for direction and stop-loss placement, these are experimental things.

There is a lot to clear up Neil, i have so many ideas and stuff, trying to think about one at a time...That's kinda hard as they all seem to have wheels.   
The red news were identified in a picture in previous post. Such as bank interest rates for all countries, nfp, fed, fomc, President, war, rumours, social happenings-shootings, bombings, baker hughes, and alot more.  
I also use myfxbook it gives some more details as for news and investing.com. So i do not depend on one site as sometimes they omit some news items.

Another nice win, no stop loss just a trailing of 15 pips used a 15 pip buffer too which i find to be more safe.   
  
This week on my demo account 742 EUR in 3 days.   
  
i found that if the Range is some what straight ie running in a pretty much a straight line the breakout tends to be a whole lot better, if the range is still in 20 pips but is zig-zagging up and down ie the candles are pretty long but remaining within the range it tends to be a fairly poor breakout.  
I also found that sometimes in a range, there can be one big candle say on a sell or a buy which obviously effects the range size how ever big candles should be ignored and you shoud plot your own range within the range if a big candle has triggered a false range.

Here is a picture too explain more, we have the range as dictated by the indicator of the sessions, then we have true range which is the range within a range, if we use TRUE range rather than actual range we gain better entires in to our break out, this is why i will only check range 1 hour before news is released as range is usually set in stone. Using a 10-20 pip buffer ( i go 15) with a trailing stop seems to be working for me at the minute. More testing is obviously required which i will do next week.

Great minds think alike, i just need to figure out what i can do with regards to stop loss, traling stop works but there is much more profit to be made, however i also think well id rather be stopped out with a little bit of profit than a loss. Im going to start to look for true range from now on though!

This is a breakeven in pips place stoploss and take profit on individual trades or all trades...

Prince i think this is what we need in a EA   
  
  
Be able to activiate BUY STOP/ SELL STOP pending orders at a certain time which we would imput ( so we place the orders and there shown on our chart but they dont become active until the time we imput.  
Pending orders cancel at (the time we put in minutes) if they have not been activated  
Have the option to for a trailing stop loss  
One order cancel's the other.  
Have the option too scale out of my trade.  
Have the option for a specific Stop loss.  
Have two clickable buttons on my chart (BuyStop SellStop) once these are clicked horizontal levels show and i can drag my orders to where i want them and set either a specific time for them to be active.

I originally wanted someone to code it to trade based on the news calender as a trigger, which I have displayed in previous postings, the reasons why the system works. You have figured out the 1 hour before news, which is the same thing I been trying to get, setting the individual times might be time consuming.  
It would have been easier to have the e.a. that cancels e.a.s from trading during news times to do the opposite for this system, which is to activate the e.a. close to the breaking news data. I hope it makes sense to you and others. Yes I know there is such an e.a. that cancels trading during that time, there are also e.a.s for news time etc etc. I will try to hunt it down if no one else does before me.   
  
Thanks for bringing up this again Neil.

Ive found this, it activates the trades at whatever time you input by defualt its 1 min before the news, you enter the news time and what time you want to activate the trades it then opens a buy and a sell x amount of time before the news, now if we could some how change the buy and sell to pending orders and add what specific levels we want the pending orders to be set at it would at that would be ideal, you can set your levels and they become active say 1 minute beofre news is released i just hve no idea how to add that to this EA

Currently you can take a look at all the gbp (Weak) pairs for short...and Jpy (Strong) should be selling too. Just look, IF they are equally strong or weak they will be ranging. However the range is a signal of dojis, and pending breakout...

Trading with a live test account is worth it, but its not easy to refund after silly mistakes. However you learn each time you blow up an account. Luckily i fought hard and made it out alive. Had set some rules for future sessions. When you see so many signals and they are all good, which one to take and do they all work, can you tell others that the system works.

First thing that would be needed is some alerts for the signals that come from this dash board. I don't need the stocks but it would be good if it works, Other pairs could be added to the dash board signals and made smaller, like all aud's, usd's jpy's, cad's etc and the crosses... each time they light up in green they should be a trade taken of course with rule according to the strategy of the thread.

Something to test is the last 3-4 hr high and low breakout of a session close. My session would be newyork last 4 hour. Where my broker changes ti the new day. 1/3 to 1/2 adr requirements. Reward should be at least 2:1. Which means one has to find the most volatile pairs to trade.

yes indeed, we have been testing 123 concept i have, but we trying to fuse together the best tools and skill sets together to make it happen, nothing has been easy and it takes alot of brain usage and time. I have not neglected this system in anyway but to get good results for all it takes time...In fact all three make one system but it is hard to work on them all at the same time. Cheers...The development so far is with Nesta my dear friend. All i can say its not easy...But will be worth it.

**Okshop this is a very interesting way of adding the fibs to the range. I think positive fibs extension above and negative fibs extension below would work really nice. With the high and low being +/-100 level. With the intial take profit at +/-161.8.**

The next test was also observed by Neil to placing orders closer to the data releases instead of the entire range. Like the last 1hour on the m15 chart.  
  
Then I was testing h1 breakout of the last 3-4hours of New York session for Asian breakout. This method has worked well to get a different range similar to 15 minutes timeframe range. Placing the same rules for that box.  
  
Some pairs did extremely well on different occasions like Nzd, Jpy, and Aid.  
  
I am also looking into the other market closes of the same 3-4 hours prior to the start of the session. Finding set pairs to trade or concentrate on for that particular session.  
  
The next thing is whether this 3-4 hour can also go after the session has started I am open to the combinations.  
This strategy for those who are following and have had some extremely good results especially on the Eur's and Gbp's moving more than 100 pips each time.

Coder/Programmer Squalou had left a great tool for trading this method which I found as i dug deeper and deeper into more research.  
Such as the authorised breakout box indicator which also have inputs for martingale for trading inside the box several times. I am not a fan of martingale but it was implemented well in his programing.  
  
Then there is the 3 tier London breakout indicator which I utilized to he'll with my cheat sheet.

So it make sense to know which asset to watch for the whole week and trade it...No time for wasting...This incorporates 123 methods, strengths, and knowing whats going on a larger timeframe...

Interested to see your results on this!   
  
Sorry for my silence ive been thinking.......dangerous i know ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)   
  
Let me begin.  
Starting with a simple question More money or more Pips? Now i know your thinking well Neil more pips because if i had more pips id have more money duh.  
  
So i was sitting there reviewing history of NFP i found usually it goes in one direction but sometimes along with other news events (red) they can whipsaw as we all know. How can i combat these things when im trying to straddle and make money at the same time. Simple set your take profit target lower, now i know red news events can shift the market 60-70 pips on a 15 minute chart in one sometimes with a whipsaw. So why not aim for 10 pips which i know 90% of the time even if it does whip it will hit 10 pips target no matter what. (Obviously nothing is 100% certain) In my perspective id rather have a 90% chance ish of wining my trade rather than loosing my trade.   
  
Lets think we set a straddle up using 1 lot- our take profit is £84 on 10 pips We use a 20 pip Stop which is seen in the trading world unacceptable (blow your account etc Risk is 2:1) but wait, surly its less risky because hey we are only after 10 pips from when we are filled in the trade. Think the more higher your take profit level the more pips you are going to need, price has more chance of hitting 10 pips than 90 pips agreed?? so surly it make sense to aim for 10 pips than hoping price will get to say 40 pips whilst you have your take profit at 70 pips then its starts to reverse. Now if we set our straddle and it does whipsaw then we can more than likely hit our 10 pips (£84) have price whip and then take our other 10 pip (£84) thats 20 pips ive made of a news release that has whiped, where as as we know our take profit is set too high we get entered into our trade great things are going my way you cant wait till it hits your TP nearly there brilliant and bam it whips price comes back and hits your stoploss brilliant a loosing trade now your sat there damm if only i set my TP a little lower id have won that trade.  
  
So how have i incorporated this into my trading  
  
STAGE A  
  
1\. Ill check news on the economic calendar for red news  
2\. If there is Red news ill wait half an hour before it is released  
3\. Using the 15m chart ill look for the range and ill take my horizontal line tool and place it straight through the center of the range (through the middle of the candles not the top or the bottom of the channel, this gives me my median range)  
4\. Ill set my entry 20 pips above and below the horizontal line with a take profit of 10 pips. (its up to you if you do this on multiple currency pairs for that red news but it does entail more risk but also more reward)  
  
STAGE B  
  
1\. Ill check news on the economic calendar for news.  
2\. If there is no news that take my fancy ill wait till 00:00 UK TIME  
3\. ill look at EUR/USD now between 00:00-0400 UK time 90% of the time there is no major movment of course creating a channel  
4\. ill set up my Buy stop/Sell stop around 00:00-01:00 then go to bed 20 pip stop loss 10 pip take profit as per   
5\. Then ill leave these set up until around 5pm UK time if one is triggered the other one is canceled   
  
So why the EUR/USD-simple its the most volatile pair out of all pairs there is more chance of my order being filled and hit on that pair than any other.  
  
Considerations  
  
Because i have such a small TP target im considering moving my entry maybe 15 pips from my horizontal line as discussed in Stage A. why? Just to ensure my order is filled and i have more chance of my TP target being hit.  
  
Risk more money using bigger lots YES with a 20 pip stop i will loose more money compared to a 10 pip stop and 20 pip take profit i get that, however ive decreased the chance of that happening because i have such a small TP target.   
  
like i say i have more chance of me getting 10 pips with 1 lot (£84) than what i would have 20 pips with 0.5 of a lot to make my £84   
  
I would like to know your thoughts on this prince and anyone else any pitfalls i have not seen. I hope what ive said makes sense it is kind of confusing to pick up but i hope you can all see my point im trying to make So far this way has made me £336 in two days and i have been filled and won on 5 trades meaning the other 5 trades where not actioned and there fore canceled by myself so it seems to be working out for me at the minute, that is using a live account too and not a demo. Please ask questions, critisize but give your explenations we are all here to learn.  
  
Again sorry about the poor spelling/grammer  
  
Regards   
Neil

First of all I love high impact news events especially when the broker does not cheat me like they did today, i will surely be getting a new broker definitely for doing news trading. For News trading i do straddle and use strengths. Today the broker had me waiting more than say 10 to 15 minutes after the actual move i was really upset, however i managed to enter some good positions on Gold, Eurusd, usdjpy, usdcad, audusd, gbpusd, gbpjpy, and more. I did not get the chance to setup as i would normally. I don't have a clue how they just freeze the software that only the demo moves, on vps, and two different computers all frozen. This is not the first broker to do this after milking the market once or twice...  
Some say its a protective measure on their part, but it also makes me wonder about them and if they do other crazy things apart from widening the spread on positions intentionally, Market Makers.   
  
Anyways prior to leaving the trading desk my live test account was more than 200% in equity growth. Downside for today i did get the chance to properly manage the trades well at all. While being on the road it went up in more profits, then the battery died![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f621.png?v=15.1), then i was like ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f64f.png?v=15.1)...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f923.png?v=15.1). Anyways i really was checking to see how straddling would work again like it used to, it worked great as expected. I usually would send the orders 5 minutes leading into the actually release, as the calculations of placing the orders are usually done based on previous candle high and low. The tool i usually use is a script for placing 5 orders high and 5 low, they are split up percentage wise.  
  
I went hunting for both news and straddle scripts and E.A.'s late in my morning 4 hours prior to news release was it a stress full and tiring feeling trying to setup 3 different machines.. The concept of getting the orders much closer to the data release is smart. Which a robot would best do this with calendar reading capabilities through dl or otherwise.  
When you do observe news trading Experts operating they too send two orders above and below.  
This strategy as you have rightly been observing is News driven and due to our nemesis being reversals, a straddle/grid or floating order based system would work great.  
Grids systems with both stoploss and take profits would be good a quick 5-30-50 pips straddle. In other words 5 trades at 10 pips each yields 50 pips. Keep the profits by moving the stop loss to breakeven would be a must as i don't like charitable accounts. so after first entry the robot would send 5 orders in the direction with take profits, one to trail without take profits and there must be stop loss account protection measures. Utilizing breakeven and closing percentage of the trade size on open positions.  
My purpose here is to be able to identify the asset through the calendar every week, red news-high impact and identify the pairs that will be likely affected, look at the range and see if it meets the criteria. The best experience is one direction break and continuation even to newyork. Trading would be considered easy, as it was just like it was when i just started this strategy. I got a big hit on platinum and palladium applying the same rules i did to currencies and it took all the profits i worked for during that time as i had no stoploss or take profits. Yes a very important aspect of trading knowing your risk versus your likely reward.  
Trading station allowed one to know before time. When my stoploss is located here my money at risk is x amount and my take profit zone will yield x amount.  
Your concept is great man...I have been searching for ways to be directionally biased but it requires to many indicators and moves the strategy away from being a simple strategy...  
The next move is to isolate the pairs that react to the data release more systematically. Rather than those that burst in both directions triggering both trades and stop losses.  
  
Your research and live trading is on point. My personal issue is that i have not been able to just stick to my reviews and testings as i am doing some independent research and development projects. While helping a lot of persons with three-four different market trading views/perspective to get the same result which has allowed me to be able to approach the market without even looking at the charts like i did today through strengths. Since not all the time the markets reaction reflects the results whether it is same, worst than or better than expected. The market had started moving opposite to all expectations, wiping out a lot of close stop losses and stop order points being triggered falsely as traps bull or bear traps. So not many persons trade news releases but the true momentum thereafter.

Starting with a simple question More money or more Pips? Now i know your thinking well Neil more pips because if i had more pips id have more money duh. So i was sitting there reviewing history of NFP i found usually it goes in one direction but sometimes along with other news events (red) they can whipsaw as we all know. How can i combat these things when im trying to straddle and make money at the same time. Simple...

Sorry to hear about the broker, thats fairly naughty of them to do that, ive found if the news release breaks to one side market will more than likely follow in that trend to which the breakout occured meaning we could look at the old pull back and potentially re-enter. Those that whip tend to just carry on moving sideways.  
  
I think us humans are our own worst enemy along side with the greed, we always want that way to harvest more pips and more money and because we want that we try to improve our system, its that old saying if its not broke dont try and fix it, we constantly try to adapt our systems based around what price has just done and we forget our basic routes. For example i took a look at nesta system and was seeing how i could incorporate his signal system in to my trading and before i knew it i was looking at a whole new system to trading even though in my head initally i was just updating my system so i cancelled it and went back to my roots, dont get me wrong his system looks amazing from what ive read but again 1 system+1 system=New system. Now what ive been doing seems to be working well for me so i should be sticking to that If i could find a EA that allowed me to set up my Buy/Stop Sell stop with a Stop loss and a take profit, WITH an activation timer that would be perfect. The activation timer is crucial so we can set up our trades close to market price without them being triggered untill 1 minute before the release when they become active.  
  
Regards  
Neil

So i had a chat with my broker about news trading heres the conversation  
  
Neil | 11:32  
Morning, id just like to ask you a few questions with regards to news trading?  
  
Mohamad | 11:34  
hello neil of course how may i assist tou ?  
  
Neil | 11:35  
First does you platform allow news trading? Does your platform freeze at anypoint upon a news release? Will pending orders be filled wheni want them to? Will my exsisting stops be honoured or will they be filled much later on resulting in loss? Does your broker manipulate price in anyway before a large news event?  
  
Neil | 11:36  
is there any restrictions you empose upon news trading?  
How tight will [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") be roughly on a news event if i was to use a [XM](/brokers/xm "View XM Broker Profile") zero account?  
  
  
Neil | 11:40  
Im just looking at new ways to trade and news has come across my desk thats all  
  
Mohamad | 11:41  
XM is classified as a market maker because we operate a dealing desk whose primary function is to process telephone orders. All client positions however, are covered through multiple liquidity providers and we do not benefit from client losses in any way. Our execution is highly optimised, with 99.35% of all orders being executed in less than 1 second, coupled with a strict no requotes and no rejections policy.  
  
Mohamad | 11:42  
XM ([www.xm.com](http://www.xm.com)) was created to offer a more advanced user interface and improved web functionalities for upcoming products and new content (e.g. binary options, technical analysis, trading signals, forex tutorials and videos, etc).  
its okay our platform do not freeze , and of course at any big event t we advise our clients to watch out the leverage  
  
Mohamad | 11:43  
you will receive an email from your personal account manager  
  
  
Seem to be very honest and helpful with me i use a XM zero account just for the spreads however you do have to pay commission suppose they need to make money one way or another weather thats from spreads or commission maybe worth a look but they are market makers, this is why im looking at moving across to tallinex  
  
Also going to be looking at the broker tallinex too this is copy and paste from there page. They are not market makers thats the reason for my potential move across to them.

I like to do this too. I think once you start to specialise and get a really good feeling for how things move it definitely helps wth overall performance.  
  
The question in my mind is always how to identify the best sources for forming the opinion in the first place.

Update on tallinex......Very informative  
  
Hi, Neil  
In simple terms, your expectations are unrealistic because you don't seem to understand how the interbank market works. Regardless, I have answered your questions:  
**Does you platform allow news trading?** Yes  
**Does your platform freeze at any point upon a news release?** Platform freezes will occur at times for a multitude of technical reasons, but not through deliberate action  
**Will pending orders be filled when i want them to?** Pending orders create market orders once triggered, which are filled on the basis of "best available price"  
**Will my exsisting stops be honoured or will they be filled much later on resulting in loss?** Stops are pending orders - see above  
**Does your broker manipulate price in anyway before a large news event?** Price is not manipulated in any way - price comes from liquidity providers based on what is available in the market  
**is there any restrictions you empose upon news trading?** No  
**How tight will spreads be roughly on a news event if i was to use a tallinex micro account?** Spreads will be based on what prices are available in the market at the time - during fast and/or thin markets, Bid and Ask prices can be some distance apart  
  
_**Ultimately, there are only two types of broker - ECN (i.e. Tallinex) and market markers. ECN brokers place your orders into the market where you get the best price available at the time. Market makers appear to offer better fills, tighter spreads, etc., but are only able to do so by trading against clients so, whilst you may experience some initial success, you will ultimately be forced to lose most (if not all) of your deposit because whatever you win is a loss to the broker and manipulation of price will eventually occur to stem that loss. I suggest you watch the following video published by an experienced FX trader who had a $5,000 account decimated in the space of a couple of minutes - he was using that particular broker because their demo price feed allowed an EA to be immensely profitable and he wanted to test the live feed:

Inserted Video

regards, Support  
  
Now i decided to quiz XM again this is what i got.

by my understanding XM is classified as a market maker?  
  
Neil | 13:20  
sorry i may have lost signal their  
  
Mohamad | 13:20  
i am sorry Neil , i m not in a position to say what other brokers might think  
yes Xm is market maker  
  
they then continued to tell me that they do not profit from client losses in anyway. Id rather not take the risk looks like a switch for me.

fact that price is manipulated by brokers for retail traders is not such a new thing.every trader with experience know that.  
but of course when you are in the front of the fact with your own account even if you knew it youre still surprised.regarding ECN brokers you can forget about it.  
a very experienced trader also with huge IT experience told me one thing ''you cant make an account into one ECN broker just with your driver license and your utility bill''. and of course starting deposit is from 50k or even more up.so you may think twice when they say are ''true ECN'' but you start deposit with 50 bucks.lol  
one thing is safe to do and thats not trade news because at that time broker will do whatever they want with price to be against you and fuck you as much they can.and when you will use one EA and that will put you in loss of course they will blame the EA or mql mt4 weirdo science fiction possible bugs.I found that dealing with forex as daily trader and run for tight targets as 10-15 pips even lower is not the best to send your sl to broker,so everytime i used a hidden sl or tp things was smooth comparing with the charts where sl/tp levels was sent to broker.now think whatever you wish.  
now regarding diferences from demo to real of course they are big many times.now if those differences exist imagine what big differences exist from tester to real market conditions ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f602.png?v=15.1) .and i say this just when i see so many are selling their products based on tester and that shit thing with 99% backtest which in fact means exactly nothing ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f602.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f602.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f602.png?v=15.1).if you test a tool in demo and real on same time in market and results are different then imagine what big difference is from real market and backtesting.so think twice when a guy show you his guru's backtests and want sell you his ''holy grail'' lol  
the ONLY place whee you can test a tool and get real performance data is right into REAL market account with real conditions.end of story.  
  
see bellow a little demo left /real right candles difference.  
cheer up!

there's full internet with such softwares that can manage to close your orders without to send sl/tp to broker.one place is mql another one is right here on ff.  
one name is RoNz Auto ,just type on google.  
regarding what i said above we dont need to make a drama from this as long we know on medium term and long term any hunt actions from broker cant break your strategy.we talk here about very tight sl/tp levels that on real market condition and more often on news is absolutely normal to be hunted by broker but of course are out there brokers that offer decent conditions for scalping so life is good.  
cheer up!

Yeah deffinatley no drama intended, im very open minded and i value what other people have to say weather that be agreeing or disagreeing with any points, there is always time to learn and people having different opinions is where those things are learnt for eg hidden sl and tp ive looked further into that after you mentioned it and again ive learnt something new. To many people get defensive about other peoples views and its not good thankyou again for your imput!

Well life is good can't complain... the account I currently use is for live testing. Though I have not been consistent with only one thing as my aim is to combine the things that work into one but not complicate things.

The main aim of the thread is to keep things simple like the first images found on the thread. As we went along it became advanced and somewhat more complicated. Our aim is to profit from these common reoccurring market conditions. The question to ask is name a day that had no news release and breakout. Hardly.  
I like to the straddle idea working from a loop effect. So should price break up the orders will continue to come and close for small profit targets.  
Yes no need for action movie drama here.

I use the same broker [xm](/brokers/xm "View XM Broker Profile") but micro I like them for the fact that they have a credit card that I had plans of getting. And small deposit of $5 UP EVEN THOUGH they are market makers I have a friend who had consistently made $100 from $5 weekly.  
  
Where tallinex is concerned I would use Jannafx link on youtube to try out her robot it probably could help you Neil. Search for Janna fx she has a trendline horizontal line e.a. I would love to duplicate the concept. It looks very interesting and it would help with my naked trading aswell.  
That's a good idea neil a win win situation. She gives update and projections. Subscribe to her as I also trade like her too.

Yes it is good. It's daily signals that are likely to last for weeks that give this scenario. Whether it is a trend change or pull back. Using of fibs, pivots and or moving averages. Check it out for your self. A daily or weekly signal and mark the date then look on the reaction on smaller timeframe. Please post your findings here. I have shared it so share here too. All leading to the same concept breakout.

Platform freezes will occur at times for a multitude of technical reasons, but not through deliberate action Will pending orders be filled when i want them to?

I had experienced this no stoploss and no take profit scenario. I also created a robot to close at a certain money balance for the trades taken. I posted it either here or in one of my two other threads.  
But as you develop as a trader you will get to better understand placement of stoploss and take profits. As you don't want to take a trade then leave for some reason only to return to a heavy drawdown so your hidden stoploss and hidden take profit idea is good. I h a very manually done that and used e.a. which had that feature implemented as well as hidden stop and limit pending orders.

Yes and no, robots have to be update depending on the type of strategy, but if it is based on price action, i will say that they are perfect for such instances...Removing emotions and such the likes, i know for some firms all the traders do is monitor the robots to ensure that the algorithm is doing what it should do and they are making many small trades collecting millions of cents and more per second on every move-tick.

The breakout can be guided and directional based on some simple filters, that be:

  1. Oscillators-Even if you think it lags
  2. Daily open-What happens when the day opens does it operate above or below where the previous day closed...
  3. Moving averages and channels
  4. Scalping and trailing as well...
  5. Targets can be set by the atr of the pair or fibs projection...

Very easy i would say, and i have been messing around, trading 123, for reversals, breakouts and strength trading. It all lines up pretty well.

**Our trading will be based on Rsi and price operating above or below the daily open line.**

  1. **_The Rsi filter settings are best identified on h1 or higher, firstly before trading._**
  2. Then entry can be made on m5 or higher.

For Long/Buy Order:

  1. Rsi 14 levels are 55 & Above= Buy & Rsi 4 Levels 70 & Above
  2. Ema 9 crosses ema 50 (high) & price is above the daily open line
  3. Open Long or Buy order
  4. We keep trade if rsi remains above 55/50 Levels on h1

For Short/Sell Order:

  1. Rsi 14 Levels are 45 & Below= Sell & Rsi 4 Levels 30 & below
  2. Observe these Levels on high timeframe of h1 or above before entry...
  3. Ema 9 crosses Ema 50 (low) & price is below the daily open line
  4. Open Short or Sell order

**Rsi:**

  1. Rsi 14-Red
  2. Rsi 4-Black

  
**Moving average:**

  1. Ema -9 set to close= the blue one
  2. Ema-50 set to close- Red Solid line
  3. Ema-50 set to high-Dashed red line
  4. Ema-50 set to low-Dashed Red line

**Daily Open:**

  1. White dashed line

Maintain trade as long as h1 agrees with the direction.

This represents the point away from daily open...  
This is also a reflection of the direction of strength at the moment...

Dear Cliffy I urge you to look on the updated version of my breakout with direction bias. This is linked to some filters of oscillator RSI and higher timeframe such as h1 to daily. The next filter is daily open I have written instructions.

Dear Husky, your inputs so far have been valuable to me and others I am sure. In general you have good intent. Trading without stop loss can be suicide which some traders are aware of but hidden stop loss is perfect and as I have said I have experienced being hunted especially by market maker brokers who trade against their clients... Oh yes its fact and we all should know it of we don't already. I have updated my rules and have done some research and testing of other great systems and if this technical based strategy for breakout is perfected according to my examples given in picture we can have a magnificent system.   
  
I urge you to help us achieve a better stop loss criteria which will be safe and take profit suggestions. So far the aim is to take two positions each time we have a signal. One trade to hit a small and easy target for profits and the other to be trailed until stopped in whatever profits gained. This template works for all assets. Thanks in advance for your assistance I look forward to your reply.

NFP has always been great. Whether or not the market maker broker want to try stunts on me or not. My outlook and approach is always the same, which is why it yields such great results. I had great results from especially Gold my true love lol, if wife should see this...haha. Anyways its Tue asset I love to trade and use the others to build my account while I keep the position on Gold in the long run.  
However Neil I have done my research and find that this update in having a directional outlook on the market is simple yet effective once the rules are observed. I would live to have a feedback from you as it relates to this update.

Dear Okshop, I would live for you to look on the updates of the thread. The system no longer relies on two pending orders, we now have market order option due to directional outlook. I have found overtime that the larger time frames do not lie, intact while we tend to have a headache on lower timeframe with some strategies the big boys do not look below h4 for their entries they look at weekly down to h4. With this update it would be good to combine the method you shared here with the updates to see how the performance would likely be. As when the system is perfected it will be like an army base.  
  
Please to share a template or indicator so we can have your settings for combining especially if your fibs are automatic with projections. The fibs incorporate the success I had with testing the 123 patterns.

Hello,  
  
relatively to hidden stop loss, how do you achieve to define them ?  
  
Do you use a specific indicator ?  
  
Searching, I have found this tool: Traderagent  
**Trader Agent: **<http://darkmoonfx.com/traderagent/>  
  
It is a position management tool that seems really powerful but not free...  
  
According to you, the main brokers like IG, XTB, [FXCM](/brokers/fxcm "View FXCM Broker Profile"), [CMC](/brokers/cmc-markets "View CMC Markets Broker Profile") are all chasing stops through their market makers ?  
  
  
Thanks for your precisions.

Hey Neil, I like your thought process, I have however traded like this made money and then lost it back over time, if high impact news had no slippages this style of trading would be a winner. There is a profitable way to trade news out there I am sure not just comfortable with any so far.

Hey Prince so at what stage are you now in your breakout style trading? By stage I mean current things you must see on a chart before executing a breakout trade

The best choice to me is either the **ECN OR THE STP.**

I met a few good people along the way in life and one thing they said in summary is know what you need and go for it. Some aim for 2000 pips and some aim for 2 to 20 pips and still succeed. The one that does it more efficiently and consistently will have a good time. Trading has many avenues that all lead to same destination - aiming for pips in order to make a profit, some will reach quicker and others will eventually reach. No method is better than any other for the fact that some have done things wrongly according to what inventors say and still made money sometimes even better than the inventors will ever do. It is for you to know what type of trader you are, what is required for you to survive or live comfortably from this business and plan properly. When you find out what is needed to live comfortable put a money value to your target and tweek your method of success to accomplish it. Over time things will get easier.  
  
Some give especially once they face a little difficulty along the journey. Sometimes the moment you give up is the moment that if you pushed a little more would have given you the breakout.

It does not matter the system, all systems require three things despite other rules, whether it is breakout, reversal, trend following, strength trading, or strictly fundamental based.  
  
**Trade Entry-Important**  
**Trade Management-Important**  
**Trade Duration/ Target**  
**Trade Exit-Important**  
  
**All will search high and low for the secrets to success but it sometimes are directly in front of you.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f600.png?v=15.1) **  
**Respect to all Threads, and Owners of threads. With you sharing your knowledge and daily routine, thoughts and ideas its an honor to be there.**  
**The best thing to do is not to jump from one thing to another but to perfect what you have working for you. Perfection is had in eliminating what does not work, even if you are alone in the process. Sometimes Isolation is what is required away from all the noise and nay sayers.**  
  
**Some say trading goes with your personality as well. No system is too perfect to never have a loss, but the session, the week, or the month can be profitable.**  
**It is never how many trades but the accuracy of the trades. The best traders don't trade often but a lot more accurate, which eliminates some trades.**  
**Retail Trading mentality is wrong-90%**  
**Institutional trading is better-10%.**  
  
  
I never stopped, i just moved silently.

I have done the research here on FF so others could have participated, Some did and i enjoyed it, Trading breakout goes beyond what i have displayed on this forum. I have invested a lot of time and personal money in research and development along with contacting professional full time trades, not retail traders, professional traders, to seek assistance and i have gotten a few insights, unfortunately the internet does not provide any security of information, hence i have not added much updates.   
  
Most times you will get more success with the major trend. Going with the major trend allows you to be with the Institutions. The main thing to know is that they mostly observe the H4-monthly charts and not below. Trading below the H4, will still require the knowledge of higher timeframe momentum/bias but this all depends on your style.

See trading does not have to be complicated and it is we ourselves who create most issues in trading, since we need a fancy chart with lots of indicators that look good and still miss the point of trading...

The charts and instructions in this thread is enough to make money every single day, especially on high volatility market conditions, which has all the momentum needed to make good movements on the chart.

That's the strength of the currency against all of the other currencies collectively. So every pair is check to see whether it's trending or not. The higher the number the stronger the individual asset, while the lower the number is the weaker the asset is at the moment. Persons who use them, pair strong versus weak for trending scenario and use either two weak or two strong assets for range bound markets in aims for trading support and resistance otherwise use it in anticipation of a breakout.   
So it is called "currency strength" and there are different types and ways of calculating to arrive at the results. I hope this helps.

Ok I have done quite a few personally, with different parameters, and it does work, however there are times when the market needs a recovery factor or strategy in the midst of the system, which I did not do as yet. The System needs recovery method for the main reason that price may break both sides and swing partially to one end being south and you think your doing well then it goes north for the rest of the day. So some buffer has to be there for trade trigger, including protection of capital.  
  
There is a girl on YouTube that does this method around news expectations just like I was doing here and she uses a buffer and a some more things, she is also looking for ranges or channels. A couple years ago the ranges would show up consistently, however some things have changed overtime, due to the algorithms programmed to take our money, so I would look on the m15, check m30, h1 all the way up to Daily for consolidation, then place my entries with notes, to say m15, m30, h1, h4 or daily BO. The larger the time frame the larger the entry buffer and duration of the trade.  
  
Should automation be done fresh, I would include a level of recovery, it is needed.  
Get this automated below and your good.

There is also an e.a. which was created some years ago on the Forexfactory which has alot of features for breakout aswell, not sure if remember seeing recovery in it though.

One may be very strict and look for smooth consolidated zones prior to high impact news on session opens and trade those, however you may experience jolts or knee Jerk reactions to confuse you. Sometimes the break is smooth other times it is an ambush. Nevertheless if you check the charts for a particular asset with a session range indicator for several months or years and pickup the right specifications to your findings you will be a happy camper, all it takes is some work, with a journal.

For an image representation there are 3 buys and let's say 3 sells. However at one point the sell looked like it would have gone to profit-thats the black arrow, then it just turned and went for long. Then when the account goes into an overall profitable circumstance, one would close all trades in the set.  
The lot sizes could not be the same though...
