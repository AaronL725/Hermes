Hello carlC,  
I'll try to make a pdf file with more information this weekend.  
I've been trading with this system now almost 6 months winning almost 85% of the time for both scalping and long term. Average scapl pips can be between 10- 50, and for long time frame i have made from 50 - 300 pips from one trade. Again, i'll post more information this weekend.   
  
Thanks

I'm not completely sure but I think it's the stock-custom indicator on MT4 called... slope direction line. If you don't have it you may need to update your platform....sorry if I'm wrong.

try backtesting this system in very narrow ranging periods.  
all systems works very good in high volatility trending periods.  
what is more interesting of a system is to have consistent positive results in years. Good luck ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Hello,  
  
This works fine even in a very narrow ranging periods. If lets say you highest time frame you want to trade is H4. Then you will have to follow the slope on that chart. If the price is very ranging you will not get the same slope on H1 and H30 at the same time. This means no trade. However, its not a perfect system, and i've not seen one yet. Works good for me almost 85% winning ratio.

Hi  
  
Can you explain some more about this 85% please?  
I am not asking just to be negative or something but for me it sounds like it is "to good to be true" when most good systems have less than 50% win ratio.  
But that all depends on your risk/reward and a lot of other things like that of course.  
It is possible to have 99% win ratio and still loose money...  
  
Anyway it would be nice to know a bit more about your results.  
  
Thank you very much in advance.  
Friendly regards.

Hello,  
  
I did not came up with this system. My friend who is trading Forex since 5 years showed me how he trades. I've been trading with this system with just over 6 months. 85% means 85 winning trades from 100. Should i show you my statement? Sorry i won't. Anyways, i'm not selling this system. Try it for your self. It is based no nothing but trend. You decied which highest time frame you want to trade (depend on for how long you want to hold your trade). Then simply follow its slope and to find the best entry use lower time frame. Most false signals will be eliminated by looking at lower time frame slope. If lower time frames are moving in opposite direction we don't enter the trade. You should have a good knowledge of money management if you don't want to loose money even if your win ratio is 99%![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1).  
Anyways try it on a demo. You have nothing to loose.  
  
Cheers.

Hi again.  
  
No i don't need to see your statement (even if i can not see a good reason for not showing it...) but a simple short answer about what risk/reward you had this 6 months would help a little.  
  
Anyway thank you for sharing the system.

The MTTF strategy is the better and longer profitable one in forex and this simple system could work.

Hello,  
  
Yes you are right. But its depend which time frame you want to trade. I trade mostly from H4 and daily cuz i have day job. For for you if you want to trade from H4 chart. Lets says on H4 you just saw downtred. Then you have to wait for best entry point. Wait untill H1 and M30 have turn down along with H4. If you want to trade from 30M chart. Comfirm it by looking at 15M and 5M charts just like for H4 charts.

HI,  
  
I like the simplicity of your long trade system. I also have a day time job and therefore have to limit myself to the dailies.  
I was doing a quick backtest on your system and noticed that many times, if you wait until the slope line flattens, after you have entered a trade, you may end up giving many pips, or even losing some. Have you considered using trailing stops? in that way you may lock some pips as you follow the trend and get out either when the slope line flattens or when you get stopped out.  
Which pairs do you usually trade? Which have proved to work best based in your experience?  
  
I am waiting for your short term system too. Might be good to grab some pips during the small periods of time when I am in front of the computer.

Hi,  
As i was told to trade 4 major pairs i only trade EUR/USD,GBP/USD,USD/JPY,USD/CHF. All of them works good. I tried once GBP/JPY and stop lose of 100 was hit. I never tried again anyother pair.   
I don't use trailing stop. I ajust my SL/TP everyday. Yes you will loose some profit. But again, if you know more about pair you are trading you can use trailing stop. Or even close your position after you have gain a nice profit rather then waitng for the slope to go flat. For example, if you are happy with 300 PIP profit close your position even if the slope is still showing down trend. You know what i mean.  
  
Or enter more then one lot. Exit one by one when you desire TP hit. I mean you would need a good money mangement knowledge otherwise this system might not help.  
  
Thanks

Lets says on H4 you just saw downtred. Then you have to wait for best entry point. Wait untill H1 and M30 have turn down along with H4. If you want to trade from 30M chart. Comfirm it by looking at 15M and 5M charts just like for H4 charts.

Example:  
We should exit when the slope changes color on the 30m chart if we trade the 4h one or the 1h charts if we trade the daily one. So we don't lost nice pips waiting the 0 degrees of the slope.  
I'm right?

Hi Ematrader,  
  
Thanks for introducing this simple system. As i have full daytime job, i mostly trade during the US session. I will forward testing it with demo acc. BTW, how you deal with if the currency pair is in a ranging or consolidation? How about major news release, do we still hold open position or just close it before news and open after that?  
  
Thanks in advance.

Hello,  
  
I don't enter in a new trade if there will be a major news release i'll wait till the news impact is over. However if i'm in a trade already from few days i won't close it i'll simply move my stop loss very close about 10min before the major news release. So incase the news goes in the favour of my trade i'll gain some extra pip in no time. When the pair is in a range ... lets say you want to trade from the daily chart. If you see a new downtrend on it but the pair is in range. 85% of the time you will not have the same slope on H4,H1 and 30M they will move in the opposite direction. However, few times they will not and you might loose that trade which is about 15% of the time.  
Hope this help. Looking forward for your demo results.  
  
Thanks

Hi EMATRADER,  
  
Thanks for your explanation, it does give me some ideas how to trade this system. Whatever the result is surely will let you know.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Nice simple method, the slope indicator looks like a moving average that changes colour when the trend changes i.e up or down.There are several methods like this on various sites and I've observed that more and more traders are moving towards simple "price action" systems such as this.

Man I will tell you what... You could not have posted this indicator and your method for trading it at a more perfect time for me than now. I have been reading the 25-50 thread by Effi Lang. Nice somplistic system. I think I would adapt a few things from it and may even demo tha system using this trading methodology using multiple TF's but that's another story ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
OK so getting back to timing. I have been trying to find a way yo get m trading system down to a "SYSTEM" (you really new traders should read that again ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)) but I just could not solidify my rules. Now with this methodology I can finally do it ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
  
Now look we all know there is no holy grail. So again you new folks reading this, understand this one concept "the most successful traders had mre lsing trades than winning trades" the only difference between them and us is they came to the market to reamin there for a long time and they no how to cut there losses and le the winners run.  
  
Now what ematrader has shown everyone here is not magic. Hell it's not even new, not by a long shot! This is the same methodology that has been used and dictated for years.  
  
Ask yourself this question:  
  
When trading a market that trends better than anything else out there, WHY WOULD YOU TRADE AGAINST IT???!!!  
  
This system is an easy to follow trend following system that let's you capitalize on market moves by determining the trend with a higher TF and timing your entry with the lower TF's. This helps prevent (not always) gettign caught in an intra-trend move. In other words if the dominant trend is down it will help prevent entering in a short position while the market is retracing.  
  
I think a few things could be done to help optimize this system for others.   
  
For example one thing to help more conservative traders is to (as ematrader said) identify areas of S/R if you are looking to enter the market short based on the primary daily trend (entry based on 1H charts) You would look for price action setups entering trades using stop orders on breakouts. Check the chart in the next post for an example.  
  
I have a few other thoughts as well and will post when time permits but wanted to put my thanks out there to ematrader for sharing this system and to those of you who will help to optimize this.  
  
Additionally I as well as ematrader (I assume) would not like to see this system transformed into something unrecognizable as this thread develops. Optimizations from this point should remain about entry exit and money management IMHO.  
  
Ok my fingers are really tired now...lol  
  
Oh ematrade... Just out of curiousity what other details can you share about your friend? I know he has been trading for 5 years and showed you this system, but does he work for a brokerage, how did he come about this system? That kind of stuff. A little history about a systems origins is always an interesting little story.  
  
OK I'm really done now...lol

Hi EmaTrader,  
  
thanks for answering the 1st. of my questions. just a friendly reminder that you are owing me the 2nd one: the short term system. I am looking forward to it.

OK here is the example I spoke of in my last post.  
  
This is the GBP/JPY pair. I am showing the 1H TF. The UP ARROW on the left side indicates the bar on the 4H charts when the D1 and 4H agreed. The 1H agreed a few bars befor that.   
  
The second arrow indicates when the D1 changed. So looking for an entry on the 1H instead of placing a market order just to get in the market. We can help our selves by letting the market prove to us the trand is valid.  
  
You can see the market pulled back slightly just before it made a nice move down. Notice the bars in the black area inside the greenish square. You will see the end of the pullback (last bullish bar)followed by am inside bearish bar. Now it is perfect acceptable to enter on a break of that bar short. But I am a little more conservative than that and like the market to prove itself. So take notice of the next bar. It is a nice long bearish bar, indicating the move may be on and the intra-trend that I spoke about in my previous post is over. So O place a Sell Stop order at 243.00. This is about 20 pips beloe the low of that bar. You can see the next bar entered me into the trade.   
  
Ok great so now what? Well I like to add to my winners so as long as the trend is still intact (and it is) I look to see if there might be another opportunity to enter an additional order.   
  
Notice where that low area is just in front of that previous pullback. That is an area of support. So again the market makes a small retrace based on that previous area of support now forming a double bottom. So I place another sell stop about 20 pips below the low point of that support area. And what do you know I an entered again. But entered by allowing the market to prove itself.  
  
This is not a full post about trade management. But I wanted to show some alternatives to entering these longer term trades based on some price action.  
  
Hope this helps someone. In another post I may share how I woluld manage my stops and possibly another entry idea.  
  
EMATRADER.... Sorry man I am not trying to hijack your thread. I swear I'm not. I just got on this roll of typing this evening. Now I really gotta stop and go do something else for a while...lol  
  
OK I'm off for a little while at least

That's what I kind of figured. With this type of trading methodology, it is either being explained or in your case passed on by an individual with years of personal trading experience or by someone who is working in the field trading active accounts.  
  
Thank's for providing what you can. 

Nothing is impossible, with a willing mind!

Hey EMATRDR,  
  
thanks for both systems. i am looking at both. How do you use the PP levels? To set you TP and SL?  
  
Here is what I have for trades for Monday (using daily), please let me know what are your thoughts and i have understood your system:  
  
US/CH: I have a sell-stop order @1.1646. This is a conservative entry-waiting for market to confirm bearish tendency. All the TF's are signaling short (in my charts, if what i am doing is right)  
  
GB/US: no entry. The trend is well on its way. So it will be a late entry.  
  
EU/US: I have a Buy-Stop order @ 1.4329. But I will hold until I get a confirmation from the 1 HR TF. If it does not happens I will hold.  
  
What are your thoughts?  
  
Alcastro

I am using IBFX. For E/U I am showing the indicator long on the daily and 4hr. Short for the 1hr and 30 min.  
  
I agree....on G/U all four time frames are long. It finally broke 500 could it test the high of 652 back on 7/24?  
  
U/CHF...I am flat on the 1hr...short on the other three

On all 4 pairs trend H4 and daily trend are mature now.   
We will have to wait for a new trend on our base chart or find a late entry.  
However, i don't enter a new trade on Sunday afternoon becasue market is very quit and some time it makes false moves. I would rather wait for atleast London open.  
  
USD/CHF a possible uptrend this week.

Maybe U/Yen too? Daily long....4,1,30 all short. It's resting around the monthly pivot.

Well....my us/ch bombed last night and hit my s/l (-100 pips).  
And my long in eu/us is in the red at this moment.   
Hopefully this is part of the 15% losing trades.

done 80 pips on gbp/jpy (intraday method) in 10mins.  
I'm not surprised, cause as i said MTTF systems are the win in Forex ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
and ematrader offers us a clear and simple tool to do it.  
  
On long time method use trailing stops, it's better. But remember to entry when all tf's have the same color (after 2 or 3 candles) and don't care about spikes...if it hit your s/l re-enter when all have the same color again  
  
Trend and Time are your friends.

hi ematrader.....  
Try this....   
it's a MTF version of the indicator.. I think it is the same as the one you use...   
the advantage of it is that you can attach it multiple times to the same chart and change timeframe for each... and have all timeframes in one chart.

copy both indicators  
and only attach the MTF one...  
scalping template should look like this for example

Hello,  
Did you went short on usd/chf? well as`i told you there was a possible uptrend. That signal came from H4 chart. You should have waited till London open or you should wait till usd/chf starts an uptrend on daily.  
I hope it was only on a demo account. Good Luck

I don't know what is the problem...   
try this template ?  
  
it's easier to backtest seeing more timeframes in one chart also.

Hi Ematrader,  
  
I have been following your system from the beginning. Very nice thread.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
Do your settings differ from those of Emda?  
  
Could you post one of your templates or settings of 1 TF?  
  
Thank you and keep up this excellent thread.

seems the indicator will not hold the size values of the lines, I have several indicators on the screen, and wish to insure to see this, since there is no offset, I make the lines thicker, looks like it resets to 2 ...  
  
do you plan on providing the source? , or can you fix the problem?  
  
thanks

Nice indi.  
What MAPeriod do you use in each timeframe based indicators? Default is 80, a bit high for 5min or 1min TF's

Hey Darko,  
  
If you looking inside the indicator you will find that it it is not a straight moving average. It is instead a moving average of the moving average.  
  
So the slope is an oscillator not a MA.   
  
Enjoy  
Ademac  
  
**P.S Been looking into it further and it it is actually based on a HULL Trend.

My 2 pips observation and suggestion for those holding positions for a long period of time. It seems to me that is much safer and more logical to wait for the change in slope of directional line and get in in the beginning of the trend not just in the middle or when the bullish or bearish power is coming to an end. It's like taking a moving bus or a bus at stop.   
So from my posint of view I would take long eur/usd trade on Sep 11 at about 16.00 GMT+2 time. Daily slope just change to uptrend and all other TF's pointing up at that moment. Also we passed through strong resistance and round number. One can hold this position for one month for now and it's about 400 pips up. Not so bad if to consider one single trade and watching only 1 pair.   
Just imo..  
  
Thanks ematrader for posting this system.   
  
Best regards,

USD/JPY just change to bearish mode and all TF's have negative slope and it could be a good trade..The only thing that stops me from entering is a daily pinbar bounced from support line. I'll wait and see what happen during next hours (days).

Hi Thing  
  
Do you know what the settings do in the indicator and do you alter them from the standard default.

As for going short I would like to see a break through 113.80 lvl because one can see it was a good support in the past (you can scroll back and see not only in 2007 but also in Jan, May, Jul 2006 and some others). If this break happen I'll take short position.

I don't know how to post a chart, but I it shows in the indicator list on my chart, but nothing shows on the chart itself. just the price bars. If I right click on my chart and go to indicators, I can see it and open it to change color etc, but nothing shows on the chart and I don't know why.

Try adding the Hull Trend.mq4 to your chart cause that is what the slope is based off.

Close Metatrader and re-open. If that doesn't work, reboot your computer.

Good enough ristab, but if you want to make it better, you can use this way :  
  
In your MT4, you can click the "File" button on the left corner of your chart, then choose "save as picture", then choose "active chart" then "OK". Then you can save the picture to the folder where you want.   
And When you want to post reply, above the message box there's an "attachment" button, just click it, then upload your saved picture from your folder. After it finished, click again the "attachment" button. Then that's all, your picture has been attached.  
  
The second way, you can upload your picture to [tinypic](http://tinypic.com/), then there are several choices appear, you can choose this one **"IMG Code for Forums & Message Boards:**" and click the "copy" button, then paste it in your message box when you post a reply.   
I guess that's all, hopes this way can help you.

Hi ematrader!  
  
Seems you prefer scalping more than long term trading![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
I'm watching only short position for now and will enter if price breaks through 113.80 lvl.   
Happy pipping!

So you you're watching only major pairs recently? I'm stick to EUR/USD, GBP/USD and USD/JPY for now and will post some charts when new signals come into real and hope to discuss them with everyone interested in this method.   
Thanks again for sharing with us ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

EMATRADER,  
  
Can you explain the indicator? I like this system quite a bit and running it live and have made some serious pips. I just would like to know the logic behind it.

@ ematrader  
  
which values of the variables do you use for the _slope direction line_ indicator?   
  
Is this setting correct?  
  
Input  
period 80  
method 3  
price 0  
  
Thanks.

I hate when that happens. Has anyone else used different settings? This is a great indicator have made some pips off it. I understand it is based off Hull's MA.

Dear Slope Traders,  
  
Does anyone have thoughts about using the slope system in terms of MM with Aleksey's hybrids (look up 'Aleksey' on FF) and/or FXTradePro's martingale system?  
  
Thanks,

Hello Traders,  
  
I was wondering if anyone knows of an Audio Alert for the slope direction line indicator that would sound off when the line changes color. Or could some of you talented folks out there create such an indicator. This would allow us to monitor many pairs at once on the base time frame whether short term intraday trading or longer term trading. Best Holiday Wishes to all of you![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) Thanks .....T-Wolf

Dear Slope Thread,  
  
I've yet to do any testing whatsoever on this system but as a hedge fund manager used to great and costly amounts of trader error and the unending, all-too-rough approximations that pass for our judgments on market direction, I am impressed with the "good enough" aspects of this method: the jibing of multiple timeframes (which seems to me de rigeur with respect to technical trading) in a purely binary fashion: if the timeframes lines are red it's short; if white you're long. Put in your 100 point stop. Hang in there. As Einstein said, everything should be as simple as possible but no simpler. But, I do have one pesky question: does the slope system really work?  
  
My best to everyone,

I can honestly say I have been using this system for about 1.5 months on a live account. The results are great. I do not have specific pip gains or win/loss ratio, but the equity in my account has been consistently growing. The 100 SL on GBP/USD is not enough. I have moved onto other pairs currently EUR/CAD, which have been rough to trade with this system. I like this sytem because you are not staring at a screen all day. That's it. I will try to post my trades as I take them.

Dear Ptournis,  
  
I'd be most interested to hear about what you find works and doesn't work with this system. Thanks very much. Who else is using this method out there, what are your experiences, and how can it be improved?

Lenoxer,  
  
I follow the system as written. I have only increased the SL on GBP/USD because I was getting stopped to too much. The indicator is based on Hull's MAs. This is why it is set to 80 (16 weeks). I thought about using a different number but why mess with something that is obviously working.

Dear Trend Slope Thread,   
  
Is the slope indicator different than the Hull MA itself? That is to say, can I simply look at the MA and determine whether it is going up or down without looking at a color change on the line? I ask because I use eSignal and so don't have the indicator but I do have the Hull MA.  
  
Thanks for your help,

Lenoxer,  
  
I have only had success with the indicator. You can open a demo metatrader account and put the indicator and place trades off your other account.

Hi Ptournis,  
  
What's the base time frame that you use ?  
  
If M5 , M15 , M30 all point long but H1 , H4 and Daily point towards short ? what do I do ?  
  
Thanks

PTOURNIS:  
  
I checked my charts, just to get an idea of your entry points, and my slope direction line is still signaling short for AUD/USD on the daily chart as of yesterday. Can you confirm that yours was signaling long and if so, what parameters do you have in the indicator? i had the defaults from the indicator as posted in this thread (80, 3, 0)  
  
thanks

I took the indicator right out of the thread but for some reason, it looks nothing like yours.  
  
anyone have any idea what i could be doing wrong? it seems like the settings are the same as what everyone else uses so i am baffled...

Hi  
  
Use (30, 3, 0) to 35,0,3 and it works good

But earlier in this thread Ptournis says that he/she uses the system as originally written...look at post #108.  
Did he/she change? If so, can someone explain why?

So we have to figure out now if this new setting (30, 3, 0) is better than Ematrader's old default setting 80, 3, 0.

yes. MT4 from IBFX.. i am as confused as you are but now my line looks similar to yours (though still not exact).. actually put the line on 2 different PCs with several different charts and views and they all have same curve with the default settings.   
  
does anyone else notice that their line looks like mine with default settings?

i think EMATrader used 80-3-0, no? I can see pros and cons to setting it to a shorter frame. you might get more pips overall but are likely to get more SLs with the shorter span.. but that is just my theory so it might be way off.

i may go back to 80 for my testing.. an 85% win record is pretty exceptional if it really works out that way.

Is there any expert out there who can post the

I followed this thread from the beginning and have a question about the entries and the logic behind them.  
  
Let's say we want to trade off the 5min chart. What I found is that the higher timeframes are not behaving independently from the lower. Attached chart shows 5min, 15min, 30min and 60min.  
As you can see the slope line changes color in lower timeframes: first 5min, then 15min and so forth. The highest TF is the last.  
This is clear to me, because the higher TF includes the action in the lower ones.  
But:  
If you entry by the time the highest TF changes color it is NOT trading off a lower TF like 5min, because most of the times they are already blue (like in the attached chart) - it is trading from the HIGHER TF.   
There is no such thing like timing the entry - you are only trading the chosen high TF.  
  
Does it make sense to you? Hope so...  
Would it make much more sense to wait for the slope changing its color to the opposite? And to enter after the next change? For example: All TF line up blue - we wait the lowest TF slope change to red and enter after the next change to blue. Like a retracement.  
  
Look at the chart (60min still in progress, but i believe it'll stay blue)

It is a Hull MA ( HMA ) Strange if it is not already coded for eSignal.

Freewheelin,  
  
You need to pick a TF to trade off and look at 2-3 TFs lower to confirm all colors are the same. For example, if you chose 15m TF to trade off of, you look at the maybe the 10m 5m and 1m. I do not trade that small of a TF, though. Where in Greece are you?

Hi Pete,  
  
I am in Naxos. Only x-mas time in Germany, visiting family, friends and business relations.  
  
Thank you for the explanation, now it's understood.

HMA Construction...  
The HMA is not that closely related to linear regression - the square root of the sum of the squares, etc. It is designed along geometric lines to remove lag without having to shorten the period and compromise smoothing. Hence, when compared to a line of linear regression of the same period, the HMA has superior smoothing.  
  
HMA Application...  
Because the HMA was designed to remove lag, don't use it to generate crossover trading signals. Instead you trade the turning points of the HMA...as it turns up - buy and as it turns down - sell. I actually prefer to use 2 separate HMAs with different periods - one for entry and one for exit. Tune the periods by backtesting on each financial instrument you wish to trade, ie. curve fit it in each case. Apply it to daily or weekly charts...it really doesn't matter which timeframe you use it over.  
  
Enjoy,

Dear COTrader,  
  
Thanks so much for the code. I've forwarded it to three developers and will wait for a bid and pick the most competetive one. When it's coded up, I will pay them and email you the indicator. Your input is most appreciated. Live long and prosper.

Dear Thread,  
  
What seems to me most attractive about the slope method is the ability to radically control trader error, otherwise known in the business world as quality control. If the lines are red, I'm short; white, I'm long. Such binary decision making combined with a large, unleveraged stop to adjust for the market's imprecision which in turn combined with $ volatility adjustments as per Aleksey's thread which in turn combined with several accounts using various Hull slope parameter settings to further adjust for the market's imprecisions just might do the trick.

I went through this system manually and it seems to be another winner in my book.   
  
I coded an EA based on my interpretation of the system itself. It incorporates the three timeframes into one chart.   
  
NOTE: You need my version of the trend slope line in the "indicator" folder.   
  
The variables are as follows:  
  
  
TrendSlopePeriod = Which MA to use. (80 is standard, 30 is debatable)  
BaseChartTF = The timeframe (In minutes) of your base chart.   
SecondaryChart = The timeframe (In minutes) of your secondary chart.   
TertiaryChart = The timeframe (In minutes) of your tertiary chart.   
  
  
The way this Ea works is that it enters with the standard buy setup, and exits with the opposite setup. This is a complete stop-and-reverse EA.

Can the EA be placed on any of the three timeframe charts?  
  
Will the SlopeDirectionLine indicator still function correctly even if one does not use your EA?

Yes, you have to put the minute equivalent for each field.   
  
1M =1  
5M =5  
15M =15  
30M =30  
1H = 60  
4H =240  
1D =1440  
1W (5 or 6 day week)=7200 or 8640  
etc.

It doesn't matter which chart you place the EA on unless you change "EachTickMode" to false.   
  
When EachTickMode is false, that means that the EA will look for the entry point on the close of every bar in the timeframe the EA is in. For example, if you wanted your base chart to be 1 day, and you wanted the ea to check every 15 min for an entry point, you open a 15 min chart, enter the times necessary, set EachTickMode to false, and let it trade.   
  
The reason why I want you to use my version is because the EA is reading the data from it through the variables I listed. These variables are slightly different from the original. You can use the TrendSlope indicator on its own if you'd like. It's exactly the same thing.

Have you tried how the EA performs in strategy tester? ... meaning that did it work there?

If you mean did I forward-test it? Yes.   
  
I generally use backtesting ONLY to make sure that it is opening and closing trades. Not as a means to determine profitability.

Ok, actually i ment that did you backtest ea to make sure that it works properly. The reason why i asked this is that i'm having difficulties with it - don't know why. Tried it with gj 1H and the first position is a winning position, and all the rest small sell loosing pos. Settings are default.  
  
So there is something wrong, but what?  
  
Thanks,

Can you post a chart please? And the associated account statements so I can compare data feeds.  
  
I noticed the huge trading volume which caused the EA to blow up my account. I'm trying to recreate the same scenario. We'll see.  
  
A temporary fix for now is to change the "EachTickMode" variable to "False" and place the chart on whatever chart you need. (Refer to post 146)

Ok, i hope that these two graphs will help. If you need something more, please pm.  
  
Now that i look at the journal more closely, ea opens a new sell position every hour and closes the previous one. So it seems to me some sort of logical fault.

Could I also suggest putting some variables we can change in the EA.  
  
Suggested:  
  
StopLoss - (if zero it defaults to the strategies rules)  
TakeProfit  
TrailingStop  
  
as well as any others you might think could be useful.

Thank you for posting this system, I tried the same thing with Nonlagma indicator, it looks to me that it's the same indicator as you are using but has a different name. I tried it on daily, 4hr and 30min only. It works like a microscope, you look at the big picture, the daily, and then zoom in to see the same things on smaller tf's. Only I found stochs (from TEB2) to react sooner to the change in direction. Now i'm trying to combine the two to see if they can work in harmony.

The variables are already in my version of the EA. Still stuck on this logic issue. You all are welcome to take this EA to any other programmers you know in order to figure this out.

Ok, I think I solved the logic issue.   
  
The Slope Direction Line indicator compares the current MA with the previous MA.   
  
If Current > Previous, slope is up  
If Current < Previous, slope is down  
  
Assuming that's the case, I set up the EA to look at the MA values of the three time frames, let's use the 1hr/30min/15min set.   
  
1HR Current > Previous  
30min Current > Previous  
15min Current > Previous  
  
If all of the above are true, then a buy signal. Otherwise, don't trade.   
  
1HR Current < Previous  
30min Current < Previous  
15min Current < Previous  
  
  
If all of the above are true, then a sell signal. Otherwise, don't trade.   
  
  
So far it is working well. I suggest that you don't use this on a tick-by-tick basis as there is repainting involved. You don't need the indicator anymore, it works on its own. The variables are the same.  
  
  
  
I have the EA setup on my server so that it checks the 1HR/30min/15min slope every 15 min. We'll see. No problems so far.

Great Trading System   
  
It was stated in the system discretion that I will attach the following indicters in the 15M chart

-Pivot point indicator

-Support and resistance levels

I need to know what are their important and what will be their affect in the decision of buy/sell, also I appreciate attaching them if they are important

Thanks in advance

The main reason for a pivot point is to help determine whether or not to trade. I've been trading blindly (no pivot point) and still profiting, so it must work...for now.

I would like to say that this system is a good one but I realized some difficulties when I was testing it. First of all, I use Long term strategy explained on the first page of this thread since I usually work and do not have enough time to monitor all my positions every 1 or 4 hours.I would like to say that I do not think it is necessary to use all 6 timeframes in order to open a trade. Small timeframes give a lot of false entries and most of time you just buy on local highs. I have been thinking about this problem and decided to make a Money managment for this system and a simple one is like you divide your trading size on 3 parts and first entry will be exactly when you get a signal following the strategy, a second entry is on 50 pips less if you want to buy and a third one is on the same level as the first trade.Generally a big problem with the system is when market is in a flat.

Allvenis:  
  
If you are constrained by time then simply Trade the EA on a larger time frame chart. According to my understanding NO entries are made UNLESS the LARGEST time frame SIGNALS FIRST. In other words, an initial signal is given on the largest time frame and then each smaller TF is scoped UNTIL ALL the TFs agree THEN an ENTRY is made.

What I'm trying to say is that you should skip 3 lowest TF and use some other methods in order to make an entry.For example: Daily/H4/H1 and Stohastic or some other methods 'cause I believe it doesn't make any sense to use M30/M15/M5 for this system.

Keep it simple. Try demo trading the EA using the Daily/H4/H1 settings only and see what happens. Use a Northern Finance DEMO account. They have just about every cross pair you could imagine and then some.

I put the slope system up against the default setting macd on the daily time frame with GBP/JPY. I must say that sometimes the macd does a little bit better and sometimes the slope does a bit better. All in all in profitable pip count the two methods are almost identical in pips. Macd is about just as good. Not to burst any bubbles but this was the analysis. Paris

The 4 hour trend is clearly up, yet it entered the sell as shown. Is it because the indicator repaints, and it may have been signaling down at some point during the candle? Not sure what I'm missing. Also, are people closing trades manually or will the V2 close the trades upon highest TF color/trend change? Any help/explanation would be appreciated. Thanks!

Hello Allvenis,  
  
Based on this system, we do not actually use all 6 timeframes for entried.  
every entry is only based on the lower 2 timeframes.  
For example,if we would like to made an entry in daily chart, we only have to look at H4 and H1(or if you prefer look at M30 as well), this would be good enough for the entries.

First of all, I use Long term strategy explained on the first page of this thread since I usually work and do not have enough time to monitor all my positions every 1 or 4 hours.I would like to say that I do not think it is necessary to use all 6 timeframes in order to open a trade. Small timeframes give a lot of false entries and most of time you just buy on local highs. I have been thinking about this problem and decided to make a Money managment for this system and a simple one is like you divide your trading size on 3 parts and first entry will be exactly when you get a signal following the strategy, a second entry is on 50 pips less if you want to buy and a third one is on the same level as the first trade.Generally a big problem with the system is when market is in a flat.

Ok, I have been tested even 3 TF and the only thing I see that it works perfectly when a trend is strong but when trend looks like a whipsaw this system always fails. Actually, I know that a good MM system will help to cut losses and this is the only way to trade with profits.

Please list all your parameters. The EA checks them in a specific order.   
  
BaseTF first  
Secondard second   
Tertiary third   
  
So, your TFs should be  
  
240  
60  
30  
  
  
Also keep in mind that it only checks the current bar and previous bar to determine a trend. Looking at the candles, it looks like the Slope would have been negative at the time.

Wow, ok. It looks to me like the 4HR is most certainly an up slope, but obviously I'm wrong presuming the EA logic is working. Don't get me wrong; I'm not complaining as all trades are in profit, but I want to make sure I understand the logic. My parameters are as follows:  
  
MagicNumber=0  
SignalMail=0  
EachTickMode=1  
Lots=0.10000000  
Slippage=5  
UseStopLoss=1  
StopLoss=100  
UseTakeProfit=0  
TakeProfit=60  
UseTrailingStop=0  
TrailingStop=30  
MAPeriod=80  
BaseChart=240  
SecondaryChart=60  
TertiaryChart=30  
  
Again, it still looked to me as if the slope was heading up on the above chart posted (4HR), and as you can see it continued for several more candles blue/up before turning down (red).  
  
Lastly, will the EA exit positions upon a change in the slope? If so, which TF will it use? Or, should we have a specified TP based on Fibs, S/R, or some other methodology? So far I've just let the trades run and have not had the EA automatically close any positions, so just wondering. Thanks for your responses!

It looks for a definite change in the BaseTF, so if the 240 min previous MA is lower than the current MA, it'll close a sell trade.   
  
I have it running with a 150 pip Trailing stop following my trades. It's working so far, and you know me. "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."

Absolutely. I was only wondering because I haven't had it close a trade yet. I suppose I'm confused because I'm paying too much attention to the visual of the indicator. I'll just keep testing it and KISS.   
  
What are you using for your base TF?

I am Demoing it using daily-4hr-1hr with 9 interbank pair...opened great last night on 5 or 6 pair can't remember...looked quickly this morning, was up 385 (est). One trade G/U was in the neg by 30.. Was wondering about how to close these trades so thanks for that answer. I put a 50 SL on all my trades cause I wasn't sure...trailing stop built in to the EA great!!! I am not sure about how I want to handle the stop...I will let the EA run from now. I have another demo NF I am using a manual set up... I will refine with this one to meet what STOP I would like..  
  
Ronald..thanks for the EA, I will share if I find anything worthwhile. Any reason you set it at 150 trailing stop??? It is a big enough stop for sure..

It's 3/4ths the 21 ATR, and that seems to be the average swing based on some basic ATR analysis.

Hello To All FF forumes,  
  
This is my first post, ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)... i really like the slope system... i'm using it as my core indicator. put 3 line in 1 time frame chart. I think it suits me. Just want to know anyone using this indicator with alarm signal? I know there's been one attached a while ago. But it didn't seems to be working in my MT4. Hope anyone can help me.  
Thanks in advance.

The TRENDSLOPE EA has an issue, look at the chart below.... Constantly opens orders and closes them at a loss...  
  
I guess I should try the latest EA posted now.....

I have the newest version EA..It is working fine. I have only been using it for this week, so we will see about longer term results.  
  
I cannot bring myself to let the EA close any of the trades. This is on me tho. When I see +400 pips or anything similar, I get out. I reset the EA and start again. I am not sure if this is smart or not? I would appreciate anyone who lets the EA close out their trades sharing their results.  
  
I set up a demo using the EA and just four main pairs. The margin on 9 pair can get too big for me. This has worked well so far.   
  
thanks Roanald!!

Hey generalz, I run the EA with a 150 pip trailing stop. for GBPJPY, see what works for you. It helped me capture a healthy 500pip movement over new years.

Ronald  
ok I will add GBRJPY...I asked before just want to make sure. The 150 Trailing stop is built in to the EA and good to go, is this correct!!  
  
thanks again..

I'm using Version 2 and having the same problem with EUR/USD. See attached. It had been working fine for a week or so, so I have no idea what changed...

I am new to EA's but all is working well...thanks again...  
  
is this the correct change??  
  
extern bool UseTrailingStop = True;  
extern int TrailingStop = 150;  
  
generalz  
  
Ronald..I have not used your programed stops as of yet...but it is a winner for me. will keep demoing..  
  
If I let the EA take over my trading completely..Is it programed in theory  
to open and close endlessly, with no interference from me??   
  
  
thanks again..

Yes  
  
Not only in theory, but in reality, it will trade indefinitely as long as your computer is turned on. I would recommend that you keep an eye on the EA for a month or two, only so that you can make sure it doesn't blow up your account.

Yes- each tick mode is set to true. So not sure why it did that. That is, however, the only aberration I have seen.

Try setting it for the end of the bar by setting "EachTickMode" to false.   
  
What I think happened is that the Value of the MA on the smallest TF kept changing which is why there were several simultaneous trades.

Thanks- I'll try that. However, that means that it will not "scan" other TF's for MA changes, but rather only the chart TF it is currently on, if I understand the each tick mode functionality correct? Seeing as how my base chart is 4HR (and the chart I usually use), the trades will be initiated and closed based on any change on that timeframe only. Please correct me if I'm wrong. Thanks

Hi guys,  
  
Seems like a good system here but beware, the slope indicator repaints.  
  
Just been watching it on the 1 min and it changed from green to red, (my colours) but is now showing all green again.  
  
This can generate false entries and make backtesting seem better than it is. However, if people make money from it and the EA works as specified it may not be an issue.

The indicator does not repaint a closed candle.

It did for me.  
  
Watching EURUSD, 30/15 and 5 all down, 1 min up. Waited for the 1 min to turn red, which it did at the close of the 9:15 candle. Next candle also red on close. Entered trade.  
  
Small upmove followed, resulting in a repainting of the 9:15 and 9:16 candles back to green.  
  
Might only be an issue on 1 min charts, but worth watching.

Hi  
  
What you see is not really a repainting. It is some sort of graphical problem in MT4 i think.  
It is only the colour that changes but if you read the value of the indicator you see it stay the same so it is only a visual problem.  
I don't trade ea's but i am sure it should not make any problem for the ea because it only use the calculation of the value in the code and the colour does not matter i guess.  
I have used this indicator every day for 16 months and it do not repaint.  
Some time you can be a little bit fooled by the changing of the colour but it have never been a problem for me when i know about it.

Thanks Arctic, that makes a bit more sense.  
  
If the value is changed by a very small margin I guess that there could be some confusion caused for the graphics processing, and as these margins are the smallest on 1 min charts it may be why I saw it then.

The way that indicator works G-Man is that it looks at the current and previous MA values.   
  
What I think you saw was a current bar whose MA started out lower than the previous bar, but then went above it. The color change then was AT the previous bar which is what I think confused you. My EA works the same way.

No. G-Man is correct. I know it sounds very strange. I don't know programming and even if i did i would probably not be able to explain it but this is some sort of graphical problem in MT4.  
A person that knows programing and knows this indicator well explained to me that the problem is not in the indicator but in MT4.  
So because of that you can some times see that the colour between the two previous closed bars changes and show the wrong colour but the values are "correct"  
I know it probably sound impossible to a person that knows programing but like G-Man say if you run it some time on 1min chart you will probably see it.

Hi guys,  
  
I've read through this thread and I understand the concept and how the EA is designed to function so I added it to a demo to see it in action.  
  
In order to get some trades in quickly I set the 3 timeframes to 15/5/1, SL 30, TS12 and set it off. This was about 2 hours ago.  
  
Well, it has been making pips, but I have no idea how it is determining the entry points. There are 2 recent trades that have been actioned, longs on both GU and EU, but all 3 TF's on GU have been in an uptrend for a while, while the EU TrendSlope 5 min has been down for the last 12 bars. See the attached chart for the long entry on EU with the TrendSlope clearly orange.  
  
I have the EachTickMode set to false.  
  
If anyone can shed some light it would be appreciated.

At that time I think all my charts were set to the 5 min. Did you design it to be important?  
  
The other element I don't understand is that I attached the EA to a chart and off it went creating trades, even though I didn't have the TrendSlope indicator installed on that MT4 platform. I looked at the program code and it seems to refer to a standard MA. Is that correct?  
  
I have also attached a GBPUSD chart which clearly shows buys taken when the trend is down on the 5 min.  
  
Hope someone can help because I'm slightly confused.

The Ea is calling on a standard MA. I just merged the indicator into the EA.   
  
Try a higher timeframe. I'm having trouble with the smaller TFs myself. I think it has to do with a little repainting.

Thanks for that, il test it now on a 5 min chart and see if the alerts work.  
  
BTW whats the stoploss and take profit for? its not a EA is it?

With my setup (60/30/15) I'm getting around 4 trades/week. Be patient. Let it run for a week, if nothing happens, tell me and please include screenshots of missed signals.

Ok sounds good. I think I have the same question as G-man and that is should the Ea settings of (60/30/15) match the period, method, and price settings of the Slope line indicator? If i wanted the Ea stop & reverse when the indicator changes would i change the Ea's MA period and base & secondary chart settings? Referring to the chart G-man posted, it looks like it placed a buy trade when it should have placed a sell at the top of the trend reversal. I hope i'm understanding this correctly. If anyone has any charts to post that would be excellent. Thanks for any suggestions. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

So... i downloaded the "[Slope Direction Line.ex4](http://www.forexfactory.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=57283&d=1192899634) " file from the first post of this discussion. How do i now install it in Metatrader 4? Can't seem to figure it out so far.

As long as you properly entered in the settings I see no reason why not. Look at my version of the trend slope indicator. (Whichever version is under my post, I'm typing from a car right now.) That version has a time input so you can add that to you chart. Just make sure that the times line up and that you can tell the difference between the lines.  
  
If you want the EA to stop and reverse at an opposite signal, tell me because I would need to recode a completely different version. This version closes a trade when the base TF changes slope.

Over my two-week testing, I went from $1,000 to about $1,200. A modest return I think, but it's a profit so I'm not complaining.  
  
EachTickMode means that for every trade that changes the price, the EA runs the calculations again to determine whether or not it should trade.   
  
When EachTickMode is false, then the EA checks at the close of the bar OF THE TIME FRAME IT IS POSTED IN. That's why I put my EA on the shortest time frame of my testing (15 mins in my case). It checks all three slopes every 15 mins which is reasonable because that's how often the slope can change.

I've been playing around with a similar long term system using the daily chart, however I've not been using shorter timeframes for more accurate entry.  
I most certainly will consider it now.

I have not liked the large exit for this system. I think both the EA and PTOURNIS it gives back too much. I have EA demo running since 1/13 with 8 pair. I have banked 622 pips and at this moment have 136 unrealized for a total of 759.   
  
I wait for a stall close out winnning trades manually and let the EA open new trades. I am not sure how effective this will be but it is acting as a refresh for trades. I really don't care when i close the trades. Most important is that I bank my winners.   
  
just a thought

Depends. Trailing stop applies immediately. I set my trailing stop to 150 with I think a 100 pip initial stoploss.   
  
When the trade goes into 100 pips profit, the trailing stop takes over.

I'd have to agree with you. I've been banking pips and closing trades, but I've noticed the EA will just open them right back up in the same direction.  
  
I also agree with a previous post that it would be nice if the EA would close the trade if the lowest TF changed direction. This would take full advantage of MTF's, and preserve a good portion of the pips earned, instead of giving so many back. Also, it would allow us to test running this EA on several 3 TF sets to determine which might be most profitable.   
  
The last issue I'm still wondering about is I have eachtickmode set to false, which, according to Ronald:  
  
"When EachTickMode is false, then the EA checks at the close of the bar OF THE TIME FRAME IT IS POSTED IN."  
  
See attached chart of G/U on M15. Shouldn't the EA have exited this trade back when trendslope changed to long? You'll notice obviously that the short is still in place- of course which turned out to be a good thing, but still I'd like to understand the functionality and logic of the EA. Not sure what I'm missing- Thanks for any thoughts.

Instead of the slope indicator you can also take Heikin Ashi candlesticks. The result should be even better because they are much more accurate than the slope.

I think Ronnie has stated that his EA only references a standard EMA, so any comparisons to the slope direction indicator are not valid.  
  
I am not a coder but I have tried to change Ronnies EA to use the Slope Direction instead. It is placing trades, so now I need to get a better understanding of how the rest of the code works, which reading today has helped, and get some better parameters for each timeframe.  
  
When I get to something that looks promising I'll post it.  
  
Incidentally, the indicator itself, while not new to me or the forum, seems to have a lot of mileage when used correctly with the correct parameters.

G-Man, the way I understand the code of the slope indicator is that it looks at the current price's position relative to the previous price.   
  
If current > previous Slope Up  
If current < previous Slope Down

The EA exits a trade then the slope of the largest(base) TF is positive. If you all want a smaller TF you'll have to tell me, because then I'll need to change the parameters.

thanks for the EA. I have a question..When my EA opens all three TF colors are not the same. I use Daily, 4 hr and hourly settings. Since this is the basis of the system can you comment, is it the EA, me? Is there a fix?

Ok, the way the slope indicator works is that it checks its current MA value and the Previous MA value. If the current is greater than the previous, then the slope is up. If the current is less than the previous, then the slope is down.   
  
My EA works the same way.   
  
The exit however is a little funky. I set the EA to exit based on the highest TF's slope changing. Do you all want something else?  
  
As for your specific situation generalz, can you come up with a screenshot of any missed/misplaced trades by my EA?

I have just started messing around with this EA and really like it so far.  
  
Im seeing a downtrend coming for cable using 4hour charts with a period of 50 setting on the slope line. Anyone else think selling on gbpusd may be profitable over the next couple weeks based on the slope line and 4hr chart?

Hi all,  
Great to use slope indicator, but I found a bit late to trade when color chaning.  
Would any buddy update the slope indicator program to let the color changing perios advaced for 3 periods?  
  
Tks indeed

Tks for your assistance.  
I downloaded the original EA,what I intended to update is that the color changing too late,we may get false signals. I found if make color changing more earlier. Such problems will be solved.  
So i need some programmers to make color changing period earlier.  
  
Hope to get any comments from you all.

Ok, color changing earlier? It's easier said than done. Let me explain.   
  
The original indicator posted at the beginning of the thread determined the slope in a very simple fashion.   
  
The slope is UP if the Current Value is greater than the Previous Value.   
The slope is DOWN if the Current Value is less than the Previous Value.  
  
Is there some other slope-determining metric that you propose we use?

maybe we can put color changing signals in advance in the program by some customized setup.and slope indicator will be very accurate then

If you want the indicator to change color faster you need to include the (Period) parameter from the original indicator in your program so you can change from 80 to a smaller number.

Let me try to make this clear for you.   
  
It is impossible to magically shift the charts back so you can enter the trade where you wanted to enter.   
  
  
Abnormalone has a point and thankfully, TrendSlopeV2 has the MAPeriod function built in.

Actually you are wrong, having the color change earlier is trying to predict what the market will do, if we knew in advance what the market would do, we would not be here, we would already be retired living on a nice private island somewhere.  
  
There is no way to predict in advance if the trend is changing or not, you would get more false signals your way, than waiting and make sure the signals are valid.  
  
From what i've seen so far, most of the losing trades are when the higher TF has been in a trend for a while, and then you are looking for a reentry, when it could actually be nearing a trend change.  
  
That is just something that will happen, you have too look at total pips gained, against total pips lost in the long run.

Will this work in conjunction with other ea's trading the same pair, I have 2 other ea's trading only g/j, with different methods, one a daily breakout (which it left, because it was going in the direction of the slope, one a 4 hour trend change.

Yes, somewhere in the previous 246 posts, someone posted an indicator that showed 3TF on the same chart.  
  
You might be able to find it in the attachments on the top right corner of the thread, i don't know for sure if you can tell just by the name.

Sorry i don't understand  
I use the Slope EA v2 with 1 h , 30 mn and 15 mn timeframe  
I'd like to get on the 15 mn chart the 15 mn line, the 30 mn line and the 1 h line. OK  
Can you explain me exactly how to make it ?

If you are using TrendSlopeV2 you need to make sure that it has a Unique Magic Number from the other EAs that you're running. A magic number of 0 means that the EA will work on any open trade.

Also, if you want all three lines on one chart. Just look for the TrendSlope indicator with the timeframe value put in. I think I posted that somewhere.

Thanks, Ronald.  
Where is located the timeframe value in TrendSlope indicator ?

I am not a programmer so I can't say I understand the inter workings of the Slope Direction Line. It appears that the SDL repaints a few candles back based on the close of the current candle. Is there a function within the SDL programming that changes the color of the previous candle based on the close of the current candle. In retrospect the SDL always looks like it turns up or down just when price changes direction. On Friday I took a trade based on 3 time frames where the SDL agreed on the direction. Now when I look at the color of the line it appears to have changed. I am using the settings of 10, 3 with my SDL.

There are some instances where a candle has both the slope up and the slope down line. This is largely because it is the "turning point" Is that where the change happened?

It appeared to have happened in a ranging market of about 50 pips on a 1 hr chart. I had marked a candle with a vertical line and after a few more candles were formed the color had changed on the candle marked with the vertical line. It was kind of a turning point...but not the nice U shaped turning points you usually see. It was more of a drawn out turning point over as many as 10-12 candles. I thought maybe the SDL worked a bit like fractals where they appear above the highest closed candle in an uptrend and if the next candle is higher the fractal is repainted to above the current candle that closed higher. I don't mean for this to be a major issue it would just be nice to know how the indicator works so you can adjust for it at the turning points.

Ok, here is a new version of the EA.   
  
It exits based on whatever TF you choose. For example, the default is when the Base TF changes color, exit a trade.   
  
It can be set so that either the Base, Secondary, or Tertiary slope is used.

Ronald..thanks for updating...  
  
How would I only use Base changing color for an entry??? Is anything else different except, Base change color to exit..  
  
thanks again

Yes, just set the ExitOnPrimary variable to true, and the remaining others to false.   
  
That way, if the slope of the primary changes, then it will close the trade.

just checking..the questions was what setting can I use to enter when just the Base color TF changes.....Now it is set to open trades when all three colors TF..

If you only want to use the BaseTF to determine when to enter, set all the variables for the TFs to the same as Base.  
  
For example, if I wanted to only use the basetf as my basis for entry.  
  
BaseTF = 60  
Secondary = 60  
Tertiary = 60

excellent  
is't possible to imagine a system which close the position before to open another ?  
for example, I want to only trade the 1 hour slope with settings 30.3.0  
i suppose a first position A ( buy) ...OK  
when there is the color change, I'd like to close position A with profit ( normally :-) and open a position B (sell)  
etc ..etc..  
it's a safe system since a position is closed by the following  
not need for SL  
what do you think about ?

All of my EAs manage one trade at a time. So, there's nothing to worry about with regard to managing multiple trades. If you want multiple trades managed, then you need multiple EAs.

I think there is an easier way than having 3 charts open...lets say you have or want 5min 15min and 60 min and a slope setting of 20, then simply add slope 3 times to a 5 min chart and have settings of 20, 60 (20 x 3 as a 15 min chart is 3x a 5 min chart) and 240 ( 20 x 12 as a 60 min chart is 5 x 12)  
then you have all 3 on one chart

Hi , about a week ago I was using the "slope direction MTF" and it was working on my charts up until last thursday. Now when I apply the indicator to the chart nothing appears. Does anybody know why this is happening? I've tried reinstalling MT4 and using other broker MT4 platform and it does the samething to all of them. I've attached the indicator. If someone can take a look .

I have read this thread a couple times now and I really like what I see. I have never used an EA before. Could someone please assist me on how to use the EA, what the settings should be for trading the daily, etc. I'm sure all the information is buried here in the thread but I'm just a beginner and not sure what to look for.  
  
Thanks

Is EMA Trader still with us? I know that Ptournis has taken this system and run with it on his own blog, but was hoping to hear from EMA Trader, like to know how he's doing.

What if u place this instead of using simple moving average to find the slope?  
  
int SlopeDirection(int TF, int SlopePeriod, int SlopeMethod, int SlopePrice)  
{  
int Trend =999;  
  
//calculate slope for daily  
double Buffer0 = iCustom(NULL, TF, "Slope Direction Line", SlopePeriod,SlopeMethod,SlopePrice, 0, 0);  
double Buffer1 = iCustom(NULL, TF, "Slope Direction Line", SlopePeriod,SlopeMethod,SlopePrice, 1, 0);  
  
if(Buffer0 == EMPTY_VALUE)  
Trend = 1; //short  
if(Buffer1 == EMPTY_VALUE)  
Trend = 2; //long  
  
if (Trend == 999 && IsTesting() == true)  
Print("Buffer0: " + Buffer0 + " | Buffer1: " + Buffer1);   
return (Trend);  
}

Hello,  
  
In comming days i will post another forex system based on EMAs...  
It is very simple and very profitable, however you need a good EA otherwise you will have to stay in front of your pc all day long.

I just found this thread having been introduced to the Signal Line, aka Slope Direction Line, in the Imran Sait thread. (aka Hull MA?)  
  
I have tried and liked 'slope' methods already and I believe they benefit a lot from having the slope value shown on an indicator similar to fig1. This allows accept/reject levels for slope to be set on the indicator.  
(This is my attempt by placing a lagging MA on a momentum plot)  
  
I found an HMAangle indicator (attached) and various other 'angle' indicators but it doesn't produce the correct plot even adjusting its inputs. fig2. Also the all important current value doesn't plot properly in real time. fig3.  
Obviously a quick check is the price (or the Slope Direction Line) _turning points_ should align with _zero crosses_ on the indicator. (red vert lines in fig1 - nearly!)  
  
A line plot is preferable to a histogram plot.  
  
What I'm looking for is an indicator simply based on the value of the HMA slope.  
  
Can any MT4 expert help and code one or modify the one attached please?   
Maybe someone has one already?  
  
thanks  
rorieu

You need to click save instead of open when you download it.

Hi all,   
  
I've been searching and testing and searching and testing for months now for an EA that can simply trade the slope direction line indicator properly! I've found over 10 EA's of this nature but NONE work properly. Does anyone know of one? Thanks in advance!

Hi Merritt,  
  
You may want to look at the thread by Trader Geek  
Slope Trade ADX. His EA v3a is very good.  
The only problem is, when the EA closes the trade,  
You will have to re-activate it.  
To my knowledge there are no bugs.

I trade a variant of the Slope System, using four HMA indicators, one extra long term, one long term, one medium term, and the other short term. The numbers aren't that important, I find, so long as once established, they're never changed. I look for a trade when the extra long, long and medium term indicators are all pointing in the same direction but the short term indicater is pointing in the opposite direction. I then try and time a trade to coincide or even precede the short term line turning in the same direction as the other three lines. If I haven't entered by the time the short term line has turned, I skip the trade.  
  
What would help me a lot is an alarm that could send me an email (or better, an SMS) whenever the extra long, long and medium term lines are pointing in the same direction. This doesn't happen that often, and as I use 1 minute charts, I'd rather not have to sit around waiting; but second guessing when it's likely to happen, I often miss opportunities.   
  
Does anyone know if such an alarm is possible?

It's still a 'work in progress'. For example, let's say you want to trade a particular timeframe. You put the 80HMA, as suggested by EMATrader on it, and then you add an 80HMA from two higher time frames. If you trade 15 min then you would add 240HMA (80x4 because there are 4 fifteen minutes in an hour) and 640HMA (80x8 periods of fifteen minutes in four hours). Then, I would add a shorter HMA, say a 15 or 20, also.  
  
Only take trades when the three bigger HMAs are running together; but rather than wait for the smaller HMA to run with them too, try and trade the break of that HMA, just before it turns.  
  
I actually do this on 1 min charts, slightly differently, with a 1200HMA, 300HMA, 75HMA, and 15HMA. I'm not sure how I figured out these numbers!  
  
After the 1200HMA turns (this is also a 1 hour 20HMA turn: 20x60=1200) I wait for the 75HMA to turn against the 1200HMA and then (so long as the 75 is above the 1200 for longs and below the 1200 for shorts, I enter when price breaks the 75HMA line. The break is the key - I sometimes wait for it to poke through, drop back, and go through again ... this is subjective!  
  
The 15HMA and 300HMA are redundant in this model; but the same principle applies to turns in the 300 and breaks of the 15.  
  
  
  
That might give you some idea.

Actually a chart would still help! For your 1min TF, please.  
  
Does this work, how long have you used it?

Does it work? Not without trade selection, no!   
  
Here are a couple of charts. One shows the 1200, 300, 75, and 15. The other shows the 1200 and 75, with nearby HMAs to make ribbons. At present, using this approach, I trade the first cross of the 75 after the first 1200 turn during the London market (this shows as the green line below). I've put an arrow indicating the trade. One trade a day, that's all.  
  
There's loads of different ways you could trade this, though, like the 15 cross after the 300 turn. For me, the crux is going against the smaller HMA, entering when price makes its move, rather than with the HMA, by which time the move is often over.  
  
This morning's trade was no great shakes, though.  
  
As I said, a work in progress.

This is the great system, very profitable and consistent. The slope is working very well.  
  
Somebody still use this system ?  
Ematrader, any modifications for the system or you still use the original settings ?.

I just finished reading this thread and the system suggested by ematrader seems very profitable. The only thing that bugs me is the repainting issue. Other posts on other forums are evoquing that possibility for HMA and it hasn't been discussed thoroughly here.  
  
In any case, I enclosed a (supposedly) non repainting HMA indicator I found somewhere.  
  
Also, playing with different indicators, I found that PSAR (0.11, 0.1) is giving signals similar or close to HMA (20, 3) (see picture) so it could be uesd in place of the latter in ematrader's system. It sure won't repaint after the close of candles.

Hi Baz,  
  
Thanks for the link. Have you tried that system yourself? I have but I got discouraged after a couple of losses. Maybe I should keep trying. It would be nice to show your track records if you happen to have one.  
  
Regarding the possibility of combining this system with the Slope, I don't know if I would be able to interpret the chart correctly. I have the feeling that there would be too much indicators telling the same thing. AO, AC (I think) and Stochastic are based on moving averages and so is HMA (or the Slope) obviously.  
  
I have tried many systems so far and the approach I prefer up to now is the multiple timeframe approach because I understand what is going on (although I would love to predict it 100%). It's a matter of doubling the retracement and momentum at different scales. The nice thing there is to it is that you can use the indicator you want. I guess you should know that...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61e.png?v=15.1)  
  
Anyway, I am trying to make a setup of the Slope system for scalping 5min charts (see picture) wich is what I prefer because the risks are smaller and you can still make over 100 pips per day wich is my goal using. It would use the HMAs and PSAR. My rules are buy or sell when HMAs, PSAR and the last closed candle are in agreement.  
  
I don't have much experience in money management, that is what I am working on right now. I would set initial stop loss on the last PSAR dot and manually move the stop to each subsequent dot, and to the breakeven + 10 pips whenever possible (as quick as possible). Afterwards, move the stop to every slice of 25 pips if situation allows it. Also, I think I would entry once again at every retracement of PSAR if HMAs are still in agreement. The important thing would be to take advantage of long movements so to cut down losses as much and as soon as possible.

hi Chamane  
  
i dont personaly use the SLOPE,but since you were looking at adding PSAR,i thought the Ash Daily may help,i think you can look at the SLOPE settings of 15 TO 20.....ie just see what will fit the trend.

Thanks. It's already bookmarked. I am starting this week with my settings and will see how it works. I am using HMA34, HMA65 and HMA125 to start off. I thought lower periods for the current timeframe will produce to many whipsaws, but I will still keep an eye on that. Actually, I use HMA13 for timeframes 5 times (HMA65) and 25 times (HMA125) higher than the current. They're basic Fibonacci numbers (13 and 34). It's just an idea to start. I will adjust with first results and according to pairs.

> Thanks. It's already bookmarked. I am starting this week with my settings and will see how it works. I am using HMA34, HMA65 and HMA125 to start off. I thought lower periods for the current timeframe will produce to many whipsaws, but I will still keep an eye on that. Actually, I use HMA13 for timeframes 5 times (HMA65) and 25 times (HMA125) higher than the current. They're basic Fibonacci numbers (13 and 34). It's just an idea to start. I will adjust with first results and according to pairs.

OK Guys Try This.  
-Open a Daily Chart ie: GBP/JPY  
-Add the Slope Line Indicator to Chart and in the Inputs Set at 12-3-0.  
-Add another Slope Line Indicator and in the Inputs Set at 80-3-0.  
-The 80 Slope Line Shows you the Trend  
-The 12 Slope Line Shows you the Retracements.  
-Now when the Retracement comes to a end, which is the 12 Slope line go in the trade when both the 80 and 12 are going the same Direction and Exit when the 12 changes colour. See Chart below.  
I went in this one at 136.98 at 6.04 EST.

and add it to your daily chart twice with the 2 different Settings 80-3-0 and 12-3-0.

Ok Summary on Results on The 2 Slopeline Method Daily Charts  
  
GBP/JPY Daily Chart Went in at 136.98 and out at 138.95 = 197 Pips  
EUR/USD Daily Chart Went in at 1.2803 and out at 1.3050 = 247 pips

Both Slopelines are the same up colour and direction. From yesterday thats 3 trades so far on Daily Charts, which you check once a night with less time on computer then trading low timeframes.

Hi tcmm,  
I have added the ATR 5 to my charts.  
When I touch the bar with my cursor, it's not showing ATR,  
only the open, high, low, close, volume.  
What am I missing?

To be more specific, you have two RSI indicators on your chart, what are they set on and how do you incorporate them into your trading decisions.

If you want you can trade off a timeframe but always make sure you check 2 lower frames IE: -Monthly is Trade Chart-Check Weekly and Daily.Make sure Slopes are same coluor.  
Weekly is Trade Chart-Check Daily and 4Hour  
Daily is trade Chart-Check 4Hour and 1 hour  
And so on.  
But the method is better on Daily less time on computer and more steady pips

Maybe was someone else wtih the same name.  
  
1) Open a 1hr and a 15min. charts  
2) Put a 200ma on the charts  
3) Set and put a _MACD 12-20-9_ Crossed same direction as 200ma both charts  
4) Stoch at 8-3-3 Just to show Overbought and Oversold only  
5) Pivots to guide you  
6) 5ma close and 8ma open When they cross  
7) When both charts have 200ma same trend and MACD cross the same and the 5 and 8 cross Buy the dips in an uptrend,  
and sell the rallies in a downtrend.

On these trades the CHF/JPY I went in late should of went in at 83.45 when the slopes were the same colour up and you can cofirm with 4hr and 1hr that they are the same colour.  
Keep in mind too that when the 80 slope shows main trend and the 12 slope retraces and then when the 12 slope is the same colour its good to go in.   
  
SELL THE RALLIES IN A DOWNTREND  
BUY THE DIPS IN A UPTREND

The best way to trade is to get in as soon as you get the signal, any delays may be too late.

Hi Ronald,  
  
1\. You mentioned that V1 was a complete stop and reverse EA. Does this applies to V3?  
  
2\. If i want the EA to buy or sell on M15 (base on H1), are my settings correct as follows:  
attach the EA to M15 chart  
EachTickMode=False  
Base = 60  
Secondary = 30  
Tertiary = 15  
ExitOnPrimary = True  
ExitOnSecondary = True  
ExitOnTertiary = True  
My aim is to have multiple open and close orders in M15 in compliance with H1  
  
3\. Current stop loss is a fixed stop loss system. Do you think you are able to come out with a version where you can select the mode of stop loss as follows:  
Fixed Stop Loss (currently on EA)  
Or  
For Sell, Stop Loss at last Swing High + 1pip + Spread  
For Buy, Stop Loss at last Swing Low - 1 pip  
Both subject to parameter set in Fixed Stop Loss  
  
Thanks.

I would like to thank everybody who contributed to this system as well as ematrader who introduced it. Such a pity I only discovered it the day before yesterday (sort of a Christmas present). After checking it out for 2 days all I can say is WOW. Such a simple system but powerful system! I wish all of you a prosperous New Year and may the Lord also be your shepherd.

Hi Guys ,great thread enjoying reading each post .The simplist methods are the best and what could be more simple.I have just found this thread and mixing it with a little with Danuk's thread put stops above/below s/r lines and move stop down every 100 pips on 4hr chart.So if price at say 1.4600 and we are short, stop at 1.4700 letting the market breath.

Hi, By lack of a better exit strategy I am using the S/R levels as exits for the 5 minute chart. Anybody daytrading this system? For the last couple of days I am trading it, I think this is as close to the holy grail as possible. Of course the real holy grail is to take one system and master it. The entry rules are very simple, now to define exit rules.   
  
So any ideas anybody?

Hi Seikilos,I trade it as seen on the chart,wait for the s/r indi to show itself then put my order in 3-5 pips above/below.I trade only 4hr chart you will want slope direction line indi as well for conformation,oh and also sweetspot indi.Unfortunatly I dont know how to post them to you but if you put them into the search at top of page you can get them from FF.Any more help just ask.  
PS I will have a 100 point stop in place and ride it till slope indi tells me otherwise when moved 100 in my favour so trailing it and letting the market breath.  
Hope this helps.Podge![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f64c.png?v=15.1)

With your daily slopes power template, what other indicators do I need to add to my indicators folder?  
When I put it on I don't get the slope lines. Just got the stoch, AC and AO.

The slope only repaints when it changes! The point where it changes could only be known after two bars.

Dear Thread,  
  
Anyone still trading the Slope Method? Lots of lag in the method. How has anyone adapted it?

Hi,  
Normally if a thread isn't very active, it is either because it doesn't work and nobody is using it, or it is a very profitable simple system. All this will be academical if you can't make it work for you.   
  
"Lots of lag in the method." This is overcome because you use all the timeframes down to the 5M chart.  
  
"How has anyone adapted it? "Why fix something which aint broke?  
  
"Anyone still trading the Slope Method? " I am trading this method and doing very well with it.

Lenoxer,  
Tested for 3 months on a demo account with great results.  
On my live account I am still dealing with decent stop loss. In other words I have to controll emotions and fear.  
  
I some occasions I had to set my stop loss to 200-250 pips. This is too much for my coronaries.  
Right now I exit (if necessary) at 80-100 pips and reenter when the trend goes again in my favour. It usually does.   
  
In general I think is a very good system. I will keep it on my live account.  
I only added a MTF stoch indicator + Slope set at 12 to see crosses with Slope 80.  
  
Regards

Can you repeat what the indicator value you are using and which tf as main? Do you use those S&R indicator posted? Can you show us a screenshoot? Just too many post and unsure which is good and not. Thanks in advance.

Hi Joseph,  
  
I am using this system for position as well as swing trades. mainly on the euro and once in a while when the euro and the yen is heading in the same direction, I will trade the euro yen. I don't like the pound, even though it is mostly trending I find that placing the stop at the last significant price does not allow me to enter with a decent sized position. As far as money management is conscerned you have to first get to know the system you are trading as if it is your own. Doing backtesting with the MTF Russian HMA indicator will help a lot. If you don't know the system you are trading then even risking 1% is to much, aka gambling. You really have to make some effort and make this system your own, then risking even 10% at a time won't be to much.  
  
Hope this helps,  
  
Regards  
  
Ben.

For swings I mainly use the H1 tf, with the regular 80 period setting. For position trading of course the D1 tf. I don't really use S&R indicator, I don't think it is required, just by browsing the H4 and H1 charts it is easy to spot those.

I have been using a variation of this system for some time now. It is a pretty decent system, I really do like the slope directional line as to how PA relates with it. Works really well on a M1 TF..... for me at least. I will read through this thread to see if there are any neat ideas I can incorporate with my way of trading the slope.

Could you please tell me how you trade the1M TF. Which other TF's do you use?  
I m trying to trade the 1M with the Slope. But it works only with tight targets and big stops. So RR is terrible.  
I m not able to manage trading the slope with better RR.  
  
Thank you and nice eastern to all!![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/270c-fe0f.png?v=15.1)

This is the only way I trade and I like it.  
I trade the daily only so have daily, 4H and 1H slope lines on my daily chart and wait for them to all be the same color. I don't have the courage yet to let my trades run till get a signal in the opposite direction so usually close too early with 50 to 100 pips. It's working so far but will keep you updated.

Do you trade the change of the slope line on one timeframe and check the other TF if they are in agreement? or do you enter everytime they are all the same color?

depends on you! Try out what works best! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
  
I think the most are using the default settings, but if you read the thread you'll also find **period=12** as setting. The other inputs are the default.

They have to be all the same and for the daily to be sure it won't repaint I wait another day or two.

If you want to be more aggressive on the entry you can wait until the value shown for the slope under the data section on the left hand side of the screen is the same on the close for the previous two bars. This indicates the slope is leveling off, meaning a turn around is coming.   
  
This tends to work on the mid time frames (M30, H1, H4) best

Hey all, Iv been trading with the slope recently, found that matching 4hr 30min 15min and 5min gives pretty good entry prices however exiting is the problem.  
  
Any one care to share how they exit or suggestions?  
  
Lots of potential here.

I use a period setting of 800 and a method of 1 on the 4H.. 300 and 1 on D1 .. Depends on what you are looking for.. I hate whipsaws so I go big and expect drawdown.

Hello!  
  
This looks like a very nice system, which I will start demoing very soon.  
  
I have been having a fiddle with Ronald Raygun's eas, but can't get them to perform well (at all) in backtesting. I know that MT4 backtests are not perfect, but...  
  
Has anyone had success with the ea? Can you share your settings / pair(s)  
  
Thanks in advance

I don't see any possible way for this system or an ea of this system to work in a static context. In range, just like all other systems, it will take back the pips because by the time the slope flips, you will have already taken a beating for the oh sh$t bar (the trend breaker).  
  
One filter you may consider is trading this when the longer term slopes are already trending and the shortest term has just flipped. If the long term slope signal is the last to flip, you're going to lose pips usually.  
  
Charlie, my advice would be to try to dissect a system, find out why it works, what scenarios are giving back money and why. You'll drive yourself to the brink of insanity, but the reward will be successful trading.  
  
Ask James16, ask Nial fuller, ask Mr. Charts from T2W, ask Tro, any of the trading rockstars that are nice enough to still post on boards to help aspiring traders. All of these guys have systems but it's their hard work and knowledge of trading that makes them able to trade successfully.   
  
They all teach that it takes more than just a system and it is absolutely right. Slope lines alone aren't a holy grail. But they can be, if you find a unique way to use them that fits your style.

I use the H1 and 30M to warn me about a change in 4H. When I see the cross of Red and Green in alligator it usually heralds a change in the slope. I trade the 4H.   
I use the Fractals and Wiseman 2 as add on entries .. usually .1 only enter in direction of Slope.. close when slope changes  
Something I have been working on for awhile as the Williams Wise 1 entry sucks  
My setup so far is:  
**D1**  
SDL 300  
SDL 20  
Alligator  
Fractals  
Wiseman 2  
**H4**  
SDL 800  
SDL 200  
Alligator  
Fractals  
Wiseman 2  
**H1**  
SDL 800  
Alligator  
Fractals  
Wiseman 2  
**M30**  
SDL 800  
Alligator  
Fractals

"Look, for example, at this elegant little experiment. A rat was put in a T-shaped maze with a few morsels of food placed on either the far right or left side of the enclosure. The placement of the food is randomly determined, but the dice is rigged: over the long run, the food was placed on the left side sixty per cent of the time. How did the rat respond? It quickly realized that the left side was more rewarding. **As a result, it always went to the left, which resulted in a sixty percent success rate. The rat didn't strive for perfection.** It didn't search for a Unified Theory of the T-shaped maze, or try to decipher the disorder. Instead, it accepted the inherent uncertainty of the reward and learned to settle for the best possible alternative.   
  
The experiment was then repeated with Yale undergraduates. Unlike the rat, their swollen brains stubbornly searched for the elusive pattern that determined the placement of the reward. They made predictions and then tried to learn from their prediction errors. The problem was that there was nothing to predict: the randomness was real. Because the students refused to settle for a 60 percent success rate, they ended up with a 52 percent success rate. **Although most of the students were convinced they were making progress towards identifying the underlying algorithm, they were actually being outsmarted by a rat**." - P64 _**"HOW WE DECIDE"**_  
  
  
What I realized was all conventional trading wisdom is "wrong".  
  
I have distilled trading into the following:  
  
**ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT TRADING**

  1. Price either goes up or down.
  2. No one knows what will happen next.
  3. Keep losses small and let winners run.
  4. POSITION SIZE = RISK / STOP LOSS
  5. The reason you entered has no bearing on the outcome of your trade.
  6. You can control the size of your loss (skill) but you can't control the size of your win (luck).
  7. You need to know when to pick up your chips and cash them in. 

Expectancy = (Probability of Win * Average Win) - (Probability of Loss * Average Loss)   
You can not control the probabilities of wining or losing.  
You can not control your average win size.  
The only part of the equation of the equation that you can control is your average loss size.  
  
  
  
_**THE ILLUSION OF CONTROL**_  
  
  
_"Individuals appear hard-wired to overattribute success to skill, and to underestimate the role of chance, when both are in fact present."_  
  
[Langer, E. J., The Illusion of Control, Journal of Personality and  
Social Psychology 32 (2), 311-328 (1975)]  
  
_**FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT**_  
  
  
_"After a full cycle of rise and fall after which stocks were valued just where they were at the start, all his clients lost money (Don Guyon, 1909).  
  
Many academic works suggest that most managers underperform "buy-and-hold" strategy; persistence of winners is very rare, etc.  
  
Most funds consistently fail to overperform random strategies (dart throwing)."_   
  
  
**OVER-OPTIMIZATION**  
  
**Rats beat humans in simple games**  
  
**People makes STORIES!**  
  
_"Normal people have an "interpreter" in their left brain that takes all the random, contradictory details of whatever they are doing or remembering at the moment, and smoothes everything in one coherent story. If there are details that do not fit, they are edited out or revised!"_

Why don't you do some back testing, this is not the holy grail, but you can make a good living out of it.  
  
I have made 2 small changes to the original method.

Hi ematrader,  
Read your documents and were very interesting.  
Is the method still working?  
I am asking coz there is not any more posts here.

Someone should look at making a finely tuned EA for this (wasnt there problems with one built by online Expert Advisor Builder by RR back in his early learning days?) with a simple lenient range filter.   
  
I reckon it would do ok.

Hi BlueBull,

Dear Bluebull,  
  
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure of the two changes you've made to the original system and why. Do you mind explaining them to me? Sorry for the confusion on my part.

Is anyone using this system or did anyone ever use this system. If you did could you explain exactly how this system works. I just made 100 trades with this system using h4 h1 and 30m charts and 42 out of 100 trades worked out and as far as the p/l ratio it was 1.62:1.Not so good.I am not looking for the holy grail.Just a system that works better than 42%.Actually I am looking for 52% or better.  
  
I would love to use this system . It is easy to implement.  
  
Thanks all,

I noticed a pattern for entry to get in to the slope system.When the bar crosses over the moving average either up or down and the bar is still the same color,meaning, if the trend is down and the bar crosses over above the moving average, that is a sign that the trend could change.So if you check the one hour chart and 30 min chart and they also concur that the trend has changed, I am suggesting that even though the bar still shows the trend is up, it could be time to trade the other way.

New but not brand new, to forex. I am going to try it, the SLope System, and pay particular attention to entering. Will plan a report back. Wish the original poster knew his thread is alive. Guitar Rabbi: good point.  
  
What brought me here is reading and researching on Sniper Forex - NOT the ea of a similar name, but the manual system with many many positive reviews on various forums. Website is [www.sniperforex.com](http://www.sniperforex.com). One person on the Sniper Forex thread at trade2win commented that that system really is similar to a system which does not cost money, the SLope System, which is treated in threads at babypips, and here at forexfactory.

I hope we can revive this thread. This system seems great. I tried it live yesterday after just having read about it. I am impressed so far.  
  
What do you guys think of:  
  
1) Using more than 3 time frames? For instance, on an earlier chart ematrader had every TF open from 1M - D1. Thoughts?  
  
2) Best trailing stop and S/L?  
  
I'd love to have the following system: Open all new trades on Monday based on long-term trend direction. Close all trades before Friday. Repeat each week.  
  
***EDIT****  
  
I have a lot of faith in this system. Can anyone code an indicator that basically tells you the color of the slope line at each time frame in a box at the bottom of the chart? I've seen these kinds of indicators with Heiken Ashi indicators before. Maybe we could make one for the color of the slope line instead of having to have 5 or 6 lines on the chart. 

I am NOT an expert. I post to learn from others.

Very nice setup on GBP/JPY. I snagged a few pips before the weekend. I'm too afraid of holding it over the weekend, although I assume it will continue to climb.  
  
+1 for the system again.

Today I traded on the market open on Sunday, and it didn't go so well. Pretty much every trade went exactly against what this system would have us do. I attribute this to the market potentially reversing right now.   
  
All the pairs are correlated, so if you trade multiple pairs with this system you will either be all right or all wrong.   
  
My plan is to wait until tomorrow to see if things start to follow the 4H and D1 trends again or not (we may have things reverse at which point I'll wait for a signal in the opposite direction).

Possible setup on the GBP/JPY. Waiting for 1H slope to go positive and I will BUY.  
  
**EDIT**  
  
I'm long on GBP/JPY @ 174.308 and 174.361. Currently in profit.  
  
**update**  
  
I banked just shy of 100 pips in one day on my GBP/JPY trades. I left some pips on the table, which is unfortunate. I'm trying to figure out the best trailing stops to use. If all EMAs point in the same direction, that's a pretty strong signal but I'm not sure how much we can expect price to move in that direction.   
  
I think I'll try 100 pip trailing stop next.  
  
Also, I'm wondering if most of the action this week occurred last night? The USD/JPY has a signal right now but is at it's highest position in quite awhile.

Great few days for this system. I made a few hundred pips these last few days and recouped all my prior losses. I'm very impressed with this system so far.

Sasha -- I have used this system with good, but inconsistent results on lower time frames.  
  
I built an EA that looked at 1 HR, 30 min and 15 min time frames and traded when 80 EMA aligned on all three time frames.  
  
I was up about 44% over 3-4 months and then I increased my lot size. Then I lost about 9 trades in a row, and I've been down ever since. Maybe just unlucky, or maybe the system is only good no higher TF.

The basic idea presented in this thread is a very good one. However, there are unseen problems with it as presented because of the limited selection of time frames. If you switch to a charting application that has custom time frames of any period that you choose, then you can make so further analyses with other TFs to find the ones that work the best together. In addition, it may be worth your time to experiment with the Trend Slope settings.  
  
And, many have said that they had a lot of losses during ranging periods. Did you think to try a volatility filter, like maybe ATR???   
  
And too many people just blindly went with the rules laid out by the OP but never considered money management. DUH! Maybe if you take the idea that was presented and DEVELOP AROUND THAT CORE an actual TRADING SYSTEM, you would finally have consistent green pips every month.  
  
Even with the limitations of using MT4, you can still make money with this. 

To free Gazans of Hamas, use whatever it takes.

The tricks are to find the right trading period, the right setting and to avoid flat markets when trading with the slope direction line. This chart shows M15 with slope direction line period 25. I don't close my trade when the market goes flat instead I wait for a clear direction change to close the trade or let it continue. Please note the flat period.

the alerts aren't working, i found this other topic on it, with the solution apparently, but it's way over my coding skills to fix the code  
<https://www.mql5.com/en/forum/197589>  
  
does anyone have a working version or can modify the code to make it work? please  
  
edit:  
  
got it working now, all alerts are working  
  
PS: i got a "not all control paths return a value" error, but it still works

Le pido a quien tenga el indicador de línea de dirección de pendiente con alerta por correo electrónico que me lo proporcione. Si tienes otras alertas como móvil, sonido, etc etc etc sería perfecto. Y si es MTF sería brutal. Muchas gracias
