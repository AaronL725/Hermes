This is by far my most profitable system and very simple.  
  
1\. Works with all types of time frames (hourly, 4 hour, daily, weekly, monthly).  
  
2\. Create a MACD or OsMA chart using the following parameters:  
  
Fast EMA 40  
Slow EMA 50  
Signal SMA 100  
  
3\. The MACD and/or OsMA value will change for every price bar.  
  
4\. Use 50 PIP stop on all trades...   
  
Buy Signal: When the current price bar MACD or OsMa signal is greater than the previous price bar MACD or OsMA value  
  
Sell Signal: When the current price bar MACD or OsMA signal is less than the previous price bar MACD or OsMA value  
  
That is it. This system will allow execution of buys at the very low point of a trend and the exeuction of sells at the very high point of trends...  
  
Your only preference should be the timelines. If you have time to monitor the market daily, use the hourly chart. If not, use the 4 hour or daily chart. The greater the timeline, the fewer the trades.  
  
I have been successfully trading this system using a one hour chart.   
  
Enjoy,  
  
TK

I have attached the one hour GBP/JPY chart that I am currently trading. Simply selling the peaks and buying at the trough.

Your chart does not show us when you get into a trade and when you get out of it.   
  
Can you post a chart from your trading screen instead?  
  
You also state that the system works in all time frames but you only point out hourly and higher time frames.  
  
What pairs do you trade?  
  
Thanks for answering!

Hey TK,  
Thanks for another great system. With all the winning strategies you've shown us over the past year, I would think you could publish a book of them sooner or later ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
I'm still using the weekly and daily systems, but perhaps I'll give this a try on a seperate chart. I'll try it on the daily to see how it does. Possiblilty of a nice longer term system.  
  
To answer WHTenn -- you buy at the "troughs" and sell at the "peaks" of the MACD or OsMA indicators. Fairly simple.   
  
TK - do you use stop and reverses on this system? It would seem logical to do so. 

Disregard all prognostications.

Hi tkimble, very happy that you developed a new strategy, i know for sure it will be great, like the others.  
I been very but very succesfully using your weekly scalping since a couple of months.  
You deserve my respect ant 1000 thanks for sharing your experience with us.  
But TK since i dont use any indicator on my strategy, i will like to get some help with this.  
First, how to plot the emas?id try in MT4 but i dont see any set up for fast ema, i just saw exponential, simple, smothed and linear weighted with close, open etc, also i have no idea about what is osMA.  
I know sounds a little bit ridiculos to ask for that, but belive it or not i use the weekly with profitable with no indicators at all.  
So if you can help me with that, i ll be happy, i hope not booring you with stupid questions, but i really need the the help with this issue.  
Ok, TK, great job my friend, keep it up, God bless you.

To help everyone not familiar with OsMA (Oscillator of Moving Averages), you plot this in MT4 using the Custom indicator list. Its under there, and you just plug in the 3 numbers TK gave us. I can post a picture if this isnt clear.

My apologies. Yes, I use a 50 PIP stop for each trade...

system sounds interesting but i am still unclear after plotting macd not seeing clear signals to buy or sell...looks very descretionary (sp?)   
  
Please plot chart and give some examples (of course when you have time)

TKimble,  
  
Your contributions are always appreciated. Thanks for this new system. Question on an entry: The attached picture seems to show a good entry but then a drawdown of about 165 pips while the MACD and OSMA are continuing their downtrends. Comments? Thanks again.

I love it when I do that! HaHa. The answer is that one must buy at the bottom of the trend and sell at the top. This particular picture shows the bottom of the trend, which is no place to buy! Thanks again for a great system.

You don't need the custom list.  
It's under the standard indicator list.  
It's called "Moving Average of Oscillator"

That's not the way I understood the buy and sell signals, carmal. He says to buy at the trough, sell at the peak. See the blue line going across the MACD bars? I figure this meant that as long as the macd trends one way, down, then it's in a sell... once they start going up, it's a buy. In that case, every signal in your chart could have been profitable.  
  
By the way, how did you come by that colorful OsMA indicator?

Thanks Carmel, but this seems to be the same one I already have, and isn't the multi colored one as in your chart?

The GBP/JPY created a sell signal on the last hourly bar at 223.41. Did anybody catch the signal beside me?  
  
Thanks,

I don't see it. Looks like the zenith was several hours ago, and it has been drifting downwards since then.

Ignore the trends. Simply follow the signals as defined for this system. You will find that it works very nicely...  
  
I have personally made out very well with this system. 100% mechanical with very little jitter (false trades).

Welcome back Tkimble ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
Maybe it could be useful if you tell us which broker do you use to pick signal since users use different broker and cannot see your trade. I think this could help a lot to avoid misunderstanding on your entry/exit.

Can you validate which was the proper sell signal?  
  
Thanks!

I haven't quite got my head around the entry signals yet..  
  
I'm guessing, from the MACD below, i got a sell entry 6 hours or so ago???

Hi tkimble  
  
Thanks for sharing your new system.  
  
Is your stop loss static (set at the beginning of the trade and kept there throughout) or do you trail it as the trade progresses to protect your profits?  
  
Thanks  
  
Charlie

Hi TKimble,  
  
This seems to be a very simple & profitable system from what I have seen so far using it in DEMO MODE. What is the lowest TF you would advise to use as I have only tried the 1Hr, but have a preference for the 15Min if that would work.   
  
Over the last several months I have reviewed your methods & I must say you need to put these into a book format. Some would most likely make nice EA's  
if your into that. No doubt you have the ability to develope some really nice methods that should appeal to a broad range of traders.

You must trade according to a timeframe that best suits your lifestyle. For me, it is the hourly chart becuase I like the hour thrill and can stay on top of an hourly chart. The smaller the timeframe, the more attention you must pay to the chart...

Start with 50 PIP stop. I have at times used a 150 PIP TR which has worked nicely for me...

Tkimble,  
  
Tks for reply. I will give the 15M tf a go & see what happens. Your correct the shorter the tf the more attention needed. This is a nice method that I t have just got to try. Will update you along the way. Tks & good trades to you.

Thank you for this system!  
Do you take every signal it generates?  
  
If you got a long signal then a short signal was generated before you exited or before your stop was hit would you take the short and exit your current long?  
  
Anyone who has more chart examples please post them...pictures work so well in describing entries/exits.  
  
Thank you

Thanks for the words. My thrill comes from profitable trading and helping others achieve the same. Let the others worry about the books. I like focusing on profitable trading...

Great seeing u again TK. Have been looking forward to testing your new system like so many. I was out of town and just got back to my charts.   
  
On the GBY 1 hr chart, (trading w IBFX) i had a high 225.43 and 225.35 at the close. Was going to ask if you wait for the signal bar to be taken out or do you enter the posiiton immediatelyh at the close.   
  
I took a quick look, and it looks that if you put a stop to take out the signal bar you will eliminate a large number of "color changes" and even further minimze false signals.   
  
Will take time to back test it. I trade the 4 hre GBY and EUR charts so those are where i will focus. Will look at 1 hr as well.   
  
Nice and simple...just like we like.   
  
Good trading to all....

Hi tkimble  
  
I notice you have both the MACD and OSMA on your chart. They are very similar, however at times there are differences.  
  
Which indicator do you use personally? What do you do when there is a difference between the two?  
  
The thing that appeals to me about this type of system is that it can be purely mechanical. When I have a few simple rules to follow and don't have to use discretion, trading is much less stressful and more enjoyable.  
  
If you could post some charts with entries and exits, it would be very helpful.  
  
Thanks  
  
Charlie

Looking forward to testing this system, tk. Just a bit of clarification though.

You also mention selling the peaks and buying the troughs.  
Now putting these two ideas together:  
  
Does this when the trough/peak has passed and each price bar MACD or OsMA is greater/lesser you enter another trade for each bar until the opposing peak/trough is reached then you exit all trades? Therefore, you are averaging in on the trend?  
  
Or do you wait for the trough/peak then watch the current price bar MACD or OsMA for the requisite length of it, and only enter once?

Hello friends,  
  
how do I add this to Metatrader-4? I've never done that before. Please help.  
  
Thank you very much in advance.  
  
Cheers ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Here's an idea.... go to the Metaquotes homepages, and learn to build it yourself! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
It's "awsomely simple," so it should take you no time....

Long time no see....  
  
Sounds like an always in system..... could get chopped to death during sideways periods, correct?  
  
Can you be more specific about the success you've had.... anything would help.  
  
Thx.

I think you are comparing the value of the MACD Histo Bars. I think the system calls for you to compare the "signal" to the previous "value"....at least that is how I am reading it.

He needs to clarify this.  
I don't think he meant "signal". He indicated you can use the OSMA. It does not show the signal line. It only shows a histogram of the difference between the MACD and the signal line. You would have to use the bars of that histogram. There is nothing else to use.

I agree. This is where I get confused. If you are just looking for an increase or decrease in value of the bar then it really is a simple system to follow. I think Jimno had a good question as well on entering on the open of the new bar or letting price take the high/low of previous bar.

You are correct. Compare the value of the current bar to that of the previous price bar...

Stop loss is set at the beginning of the trade and is static until I reach a 150 PIP profit then a go to break even and maintain a 150 PIP trailing stop...

I really like this system, especially using the OsMA Color indicater posted earllier in this thread. I would love it if this could be made into an alert that alerts me when the bars change color (pivot in value) It would need to be set to alert upon the close of the bar. It should also be good for all time frames as sometimes price retraces, then say, if you're trading based on a 1 hour time frame, and it retraces, you can enter after a smaller time frame, say M5 turns in the direction you wanna trade, and enter then. Just a thought. Probably someone could as well creat an EA fairly easilly, but I don't think I'd be using that as there are too many variables in the chart to be consistent on all trades.

I didnt take that particular short signal as I was uneasy about where the bar ended at, right on support, so I didn't take it, and am actualy long right now instead... we'll see

As far as I understand there's no discrectional in this method this is why I took that signal.

Well, it's hard for me to not use discretion ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)... it's just my nature. If no discretion is needed then this should be the easiest EA to create and use, with no time, emotion, or discretion invested, right? Backtesting, using no discretion, should be fairly easy.

I am giving, what seems to be, a very simple strategy a try. If I understand correctly, the "signal" is when the value of the next bar on OsMA is up or down from the previous one. At 11:00 am today, the next bar was "up" thus producing a "Buy" signal. I went long. A few, very short minutes later, my trade (GBP/JPY - 1 hr. chart) went south for a full 50 pip loss (50 pip stop per system). Did I miss something? When do you enter trades is you are trading 1 hr chart? At the beginning of each hour? If you get stopped out, do you have to wait and see what happens at the start of next hour? Please clarify. Thanks!

Yes. It seems to be correct. I likewise loss 50 PIPs on the same trade but am now long on the subsequent trade and up 60 PIPS...  
  
Are you using MT4 to make these great looking charts???

This is correct. Simply compare previous OsMA price bar value to current OsMA price bar value.

Do you just use GBP/JPY for this system? Also, do you have to wait for beginning of each hr. too enter & exit trades if yo are trading the hrly chart?

Thx TK ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
I lost also next trade since I entered long two candles late and I suffer another 50 pips loss ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1)

The beauty of this system is that it is adaptable to any pair for any timeframe. Really depends on your trading style (fast, slow, watch market all day, not watch market all day, etc.)

Hi TK,  
  
Nice simple system you have here!  
  
I notice you prefer to use the OSMA rather than MACD for entries.   
  
Can I just ask what does the signal setting on the OSMA indicator do? I know on MACD it gives the 100 average of the histogram bars and plots that on the same graph? On the OSMA indicator I don't see this however?  
  
Also whilst we are on the 100 Signal SMA how do you use it on the MACD? Do you use it as an additional filter or not at all?  
  
Thanks,

I am assuming SL is variable with whatever time frame you are using (or ideally with your account size vis a vis potential draw down for this system)?

MACD = Fast MA - Slow MA  
In this case it is 40MA - 50MA.  
  
The signal line is a MA of the MACD.  
  
In this case it is a 100MA of the MACD.  
  
The standard MT4 MACD is an oddball. It plots the MACD as a histogram. In every other application I have seen, it is plotted as a line.  
In MT4 the MACD is a histogram and the signal line is shown as a thin line threading through it.  
  
Usually both the MACD and the signal line are shown as lines. They look like a couple of MAs moving together.  
  
The histogram, in most applications, is the difference between the MACD and the signal line.  
  
This histogram is what we are using here. This is what the OSMA is.  
  
Don't use the MT4 MACD. It is totally different than what you want for this system.  
  
Use the OSMA.

hi tkimble  
  
do you think your methods could work in trading the e-mini futures?  
  
also is it possible do you think to use tick charts with your systems?

This method also looks simple and easy to understand. I'm guessing that you probably already have been playing with settings for the smaller timeframes!? There is really no use in doing a job if it has already been done, so my question will be if the settings used by you in 1H works best in the smaller timeframes also? After a fast overlook I noticed that 5M is way to choppy for this, but from 15M and up it would/could work also.  
  
Another observation was that by using BOTH OsMA and MACD as triggers, meaning that they both have to show the same signal, you could wash out a few of the bad trades. But I have to say that I have not done any extensive testing on this.

Hi,

Being only inthe forex arena for several months, when someone that has the respect and admiration of others (tkimble) that have been in forex far longer than I, I would be a fool not to pay attention. I think it was J.Paul Getty that once said he got rich by hiring guys that were much smarter than he was. So, I'm applying that philosophy to forex. I plan on getting rich by paying attention to to people that are much smarter than I. When tkimble says this is his best system ever, I have to believe that it probably is. When I see the accolades of others that have followed him in the past, I know he knows what he's talking about. Further, when I see that he's not interested in writing a book and making money off that book, which he most assuredly could, I poersonally have admiration already for the guy. So, being not quite a newbie, which is probably good, because I know I don't know much, I have read this thread twice already. Good thing it's not 1000 pages (yet), but I'm sure it will be in short order. I'm new here. Have traded forex for about a year. Much better and safer than the stock market, and I love it. Look forward to being here a long time. By the way, I have already paid my dues in the stock market, and have not been, and will not be, one of the 95% people who lose in forex. That's my vow, and that's why I'm here. With the assistance and knowledge of people like tkimble and many others here, I'll be in the 5%. Nice meeting all of you.

Only exit when you are stopped out. Otherwise it is a Stop and Reverse (SAR) which is my preference for trading. I love the action.

If I am right you can only Enter the new direction after the first change in direction of the OSMA has been confirmed? So that would be the open of the second bar after the peak or trough?  
  
Thank you.

I appreciate the creativity that people use to develope systems I find it very interesting and it makes trading more interesting than it really is (thats why I enjoy reading about other people's systems on the forum). But when I read something like this above it reminds me of when I was still trying to be profitable and I was system hopping all over the place. Its great when you find something that fits you as a trading method, but only time will tell you whether it really is for you or not. I just want to throw in a point that most of the systems on FF are about entry into the market. Caution is needed. You could trade off a coin flip which would give you 50/50 profitable trades and be profitable. My point is, entry is not as important as your money management and your exits. A system can have 90% probability of winning and you could still lose. A system could have 30% chance of winning and you could be profitable! Just knowing a good entry will not get you into the 5% team.

What do you mean by stop and reverse? Is it not the prudent thing to get out once the trend changes and before you lose all profits. If you stay in until stopped out, you would lose on every trade unless you used a t.s. Correct? Thanks!  
  
P.S. On the weekly scalping system - I hit a stop loss on BTH long and short trades. What do you do then? Wait until next week or what? Many thanks.

But when I read something like this above it reminds me of when I was still trying to be profitable and I was system hopping all over the place. Its great when you find something that fits you as a trading method, but only time will tell you whether it really is for you or not.

A system can have 90% probability of winning and you could still lose. A system could have 30% chance of winning and you could be profitable! Just knowing a good entry will not get you into the 5% team.

I appreciate the advice. Another person who trades forex for a living taught me that money management is even more important than the trading. Depending on your risk tolerance, I've learned that there's all kinds of money management systems, ranging from the conservative of not using more than 1% on any one trade to the risky of using variations of the Martingale systems. Or the "Profitsrup" system that I consider risky. For my own trading, I have chosen to use approximately 3% of my account balance on every trade. That way, I am risking less when losing, and more when winning. I always use stops, and with a definite 50 pip stop loss, I can easily figure how many lots to trade that would equal that 3% risk. For instance, 3 lots with a balance of $5,000., and 6 lots with a balance of $10,000. In other forex rooms, this topic was debated extensively and sometimes heatedly, with people sarcastically claiming that a person would never get anywhere unless they used the (you pick it) money management system. My choice was 3%, and combined with a good system. I am always open to suggestions and learning from others who have more experience and knowledge than I.

I spent hours looking at this osma setting. I back tested June for GBP/JPY which for some reason I have some difficulty in back test trading with any H1 and upwards TF systems. It was relatively succesful. Made a profit, anyway. Then I traded January and was getting some profitable but relatively poor results. Then I encountered this:

It looks like this osma setting doesn't read long upward trends very well. It might not be a problem if we are aware of it.

Your scenario is the kind that will make you money even if you win ony 50% of the time. I look for either a system that has a track record of about 60%, or one that wins more pips than it loses per trade. Seems that some are already dissing this system. Maybe they're right. But, from what I see, the wins on this one far outnumber the losses, and a 50 pip stop loss would have saved you during the "January" scenario. I have to think that tkimble knows what he's doing, since he's come up with other good systems. Seems like people look for the holy grail here, and look for faults in other peoples systems. No system is going to be 100%, or perfect for all times.

Thanks tkimble for sharing this system. It's nice to simplify for a change.  
  
Two quick questions:  
  
1\. Do you excercise _any_ discretion at all regarding the longer term trend? Does it affect your TP levels/expectations or your stop levels?  
  
2\. Should I assume that entry always occurs at the _close_ of a bar -- so at the _open_ of the second bar after an OsMA value change? (see attached)  
  
Many thanks.

I think tkimble would have had a 150 pip trailing stop in the January scenario and (I haven't looked back) made a few hundred extra pips. It seems to me that if we know about this phenomenon - it's as though the indicator has nowhere to go after the price continues to rise - it can be used to advantage. I hope you don't think I was "dissing". I don't want to change anything. I just wanted to point out something.

This system does not recognize longer term trends when making trade entries.

> Being only inthe forex arena for several months, when someone that has the respect and admiration of others (tkimble) that have been in forex far longer than I, I would be a fool not to pay attention. I think it was J.Paul Getty that once said he got rich by hiring guys that were much smarter than he was. So, I'm applying that philosophy to forex. I plan on getting rich by paying attention to to people that are much smarter than I. When tkimble says this is his best system ever, I have to believe that it probably is. When I see the accolades of others that have followed him in the past, I know he knows what he's talking about. Further, when I see that he's not interested in writing a book and making money off that book, which he most assuredly could, I poersonally have admiration already for the guy. So, being not quite a newbie, which is probably good, because I know I don't know much, I have read this thread twice already. Good thing it's not 1000 pages (yet), but I'm sure it will be in short order. I'm new here. Have traded forex for about a year. Much better and safer than the stock market, and I love it. Look forward to being here a long time. By the way, I have already paid my dues in the stock market, and have not been, and will not be, one of the 95% people who lose in forex. That's my vow, and that's why I'm here. With the assistance and knowledge of people like tkimble and many others here, I'll be in the 5%. Nice meeting all of you.

I don't know how to attach charts. Have tried for the past half hour to figure it out. Anyway, regarding the trade you're in, looking at my North Finance chart, it appears the trade would have developed at 12:00 (probably 9:00 on the broker you use?). I got an open of 224.58, which is close enough to your 224.56. The two OSMA bars before this open were 0.148 and then 0.149, and were in the lower end of the trough. So, had I been watching the chart at that time, seeing as the OSma value had increased by a point, I would have planned a quick entry right at the open of the next hour?  
  
As I write this, it sits at 229.19 for a gain of 463 pips!!! And, you would stay in this trade until the OSMA values started going down? Seems I have it right, but want to sure.   
  
One final thing. I assume you simply leave a 150 pip stop loss in a situation like this when you have to be away or are sleeping, assuming you do sleep?

150 PIP stop is correct. Great trade. I would stay with the trade until you get the next signal...

Let me see if I got this one down.  
  
According to this system I would have taken each of these 20 entries (one at each color change).  
  
Furthermore, if I had any open positions I would have exited them and initiated a new trade in the opposite direction as well (assuming that my 50 pip stop loss or my 150 pip trailing stop had not been hit) Correct?  
  
I know a few pages back that TKimble said he is "simply selling the peaks and buying at the trough". But you won't know that you're buying at those levels until you're into the trade.  
  
Unless he means he only enters once on each side of the zero line? But that doesn't seem right as it would eliminate a lot of profitable trades. Anyone got an idea about that statement. Do we simply trade each color change (if you're using the OSMA Color indicator) or is there more to this?  
  
Sorry for the size of the chart, I didn't want to make it too big. It is based on the GBP/JPY Daily from about the middle of May 2007 until now.

Yes. We simply trade the color changes.  
Each color change creates a small peak or valley.

Does this system work well with other pairs (other than GBP/USD)? The GBP pair has a 9 pip spread on IBFX. Also, do you wait for the peaks and valleys to enter a trade, or can you jump in and ride the way up or down. Thanks.

Nearing short signal. There are times when the price bar MACD or OsMA values are identical but change as the following bar matures. That is the case as I am typing. I have taken the short GBP/JPY signal at 228.46.

The bar hasn't completed for the short.  
I thought you waited for the bar to close.

That is correct unless both bars are of equal value, then I will take the trade.  
  
The two previous bars have a value of .3996 - I accept this as a signal becuase typically at the conclusion of the current bar, the previous bar's value will have dropped below .3996. This sometimes occurs due to a lagging OsMA or MACD calculation.

I jumped in short at 228.47. I didn't know we were supposed to wait for the close of the bar!   
  
I also noticed the double top and price closing below 10 SMA which I think is a nice confirmation of a downward move.

tkimble,  
  
What did you mean by - both bars of equal value?  
  
Which two bars are you talking about being of equal value that will cause you to enter before the price bar closes?

I'm no expert but it sounds like he's saying that if the current bar is down (but hasn't closed) and the previous two bars are of equal value (in this case 0.396 I think) then he will exit because normally the second bar of the two will readjust lower due to the lagging calculations of the OSMA and MACD.

Yes happens very frequently so I reverse my position if both bars are of equal value. Normally, the previous bar will adjust after the current bar has completed its timeframe...

This is an excellent example of entry management. You now see that the last bar in fact confirmed the short signal. Had you waited till the end of the last bar, you would have went short at 228.18 instead of taking the short position when the previous bars were equal at a price of 228.48 and you would now have been stopped out since the market has passed the 228.68 mark which is where your stop would have been placed.  
  
While this trade is currently position unfriendly, at least we are not yet stopped out and still have a chance for a profitable trade...

If you get stopped out, do you have a method of reentry?  
Or do you wait until a trend change?

OK, here's an example that I need help interpreting, please.  
  
A classic long entry on the OsMA, yes? And yet price just continues to fall and fall....  
  
Is this simply a case of taking the 50pip stop-out on the chin and moving on? Or am I misinterpreting the rules?  
  
Many thanks.

Fiveshorts, looks to me like a valid entry and if it hadn't moved up at least 150 pips prior to continuing its downtrend then it looks like you would have had a 50 pip loss. Oh well, next trade!

It's a little too complicated to go into here.  
Basically after you get the signal to enter the trade (in this case tonight it was a lower OSMA bar), you use a 1MA and 5MA on the 1M or 5M chart to actually enter.  
Using that method tonight would have gotten you in at 228.64.

So essentially it is another method of going short since you enter your position before a short signal was given on this time frame?  
  
Honestly, after i refine a system, i have had a tendancy to figure out how to get into trades earlier, but ultimately i concluded that what i am really doing is adjusting the system and thus skewing results. It makes total sense to use different timeframes to get in earlier, i just haven't been able to do it consistently, plus i don't have as much confidence in the trade as i don't have a true signal from the system that i tested.   
  
Good trading,

I wouldn't have been getting in earlier, I would have been getting in later- on the following bar that retraced.  
  
Using that tonight would have gotten you a 40 pip better entrance price.  
  
I don't mind skewing the results, at all, as long as it's in my favor.

Sounds like it could be a good filter for the new "two equal bars" rule. Though I don't know if I would use a 1 MA and 5 MA on such a volatile pair as GBP/JPY. Maybe a 3 SMA and 8 SMA based on HLC/3 (pivot point moving averages) would be a little smoother. I'd also look at prior price action to see if price is finding support/resistance at the 3 SMA.   
  
If you notice the prior uptrend before the short signal, the price stayed right on top of the 3 SMA the whole move up. Thats what I like to see.  
  
Also it's nice if price stays away from the 8 SMA.

Go read the thread I posted. It's not as simple as the two moving averages. There's more to it than that.

Gotcha. I just finished reading his posts throughout the _entire_ thread. I like what he says. Essentially, when applied to this method we would wait for the OsMA signal (color change) then drop to the 1 or 5 minute chart and look for a 1 MA to cross the 5 MA (Linear Weighted, HL/2) in the direction of our signal. We would enter at the market and place our stop at the 5 MA. Once we were in profit an amount equal to our spread (7 pips), we would move our stop to breakeven. Thus minimizing our risk on any trade to a few pips (about 8 pips in tonights case).  
  
I like it. We would need to adjust our TP levels. If we had waited for a reverse cross of the 1 MA and 5 MA we would have taken a 7 pip profit (when our max profit was 42 pips). I should also note that if we didn't take a profit at the cross we would have been stopped out at 07:55 (if stop was placed at 228.50).  
  
May be a good way to scalp some pips on few trades while the longer term trade plays out.  
  
Also my prices may differ from yours, I'm using MT4 on Alpari.

Additionally, had we been stopped out from first trade and re-entered on next downward cross we would have been stopped out on the next bar and finally on the third downward cross at 228.18 we would have re-entered and would now be sitting on a 57+ pip profit. Not bad. Not to mention the previous 2 trades were stopped out at _**breakeven**_.  
  
Only downside to this is having to sit at the monitor watching for crosses.

I don't exactly follow you. Tonight our entry would have been at 0522 GMT @ 228.63. We would still be in the trade. It was downhill from there.  
  
You don't just wait for the MA cross on the 1M chart. The stoch has to hit 100 then turn down with a cross.

Hmm. On my chart I get the stochastics dropping from overbought levels at 6:30 GMT (after the close of the first down OsMA bar). At that time the moving averages crossed and the 5 MA was at 228.50. According to nanningbob we would place our stop there until we had a profit equal to our spread (7 pips) then we move our stop to breakeven (which we eventually would have in this case).  
  
Now, according to my chart, at around 7:55 GMT, price hit 228.50 which would have activated our stop. Right?  
  
Then I was thinking we could have re-entered after the next downward cross as the stochastics approached the 80 line and reversed. If we had placed our stop at the 5 MA again we would have been stopped.  
  
On the third downward cross (8:00 GMT), the stochastics didn't quite reach the 80 line but if you draw a trend line along the stochastic highs you could see a downward trend. I took this as a bearish indicator and took the third trade which proved profitable (and still is).  
  
Again my charts my differ from yours. Im using the GBP/JPY 1H for long term signal and 5M for entry. Im also using the MT4 Stochastic Oscillator.  
  
Whatever the case may be though, I appreciate the link to the thread.

Bill/Lincoln ; I just put together a screen with all time frames on them and the simple OSMA indicator. When i look at all of them it gets very confusing unless you know how to properly trade different time frames. When to get in, when to get out... Some show long, some show short.  
  
Bill, if we simply used the 30 minute chart, this system would have gotten us in "early" compared to the 1 hr chart. my IBFX chart shows a short of 228.64 on the 30 minute chart. If you had traded the 15 minute chart, you would have shorted at 228.84 after one stop out. The 5 min is another entry. So IMO the real question is, "What time frame are you REALLY trading?" Seems to me u are trading the equivalent of the 30 min system and bringing in another system to enter.....Honestly very confusing why you would make such a simple system so complicated to trade.  
  
Personally, i am trading the 4 hr charts and am still long. Now for me to trade anything else if fine, but i better have back or forward tested it to understand how it works.   
  
I find that so many of us tend to take a simple system and want to make it so complicated. TK's system (S) are so simple, and work. Like all systems, you take your lumps, but they are profitable. They certainly can be refined and adjusted and TK encourages all traders to make it work for them.   
  
Just my 2 cents, but the simpliar and clearer rules the better, but nothing stops us from adjusting them together or for ourselves.   
  
Thanks..

I used the 1M for entry.  
The OSMA bar that gave the short signal closed at 0500 GMT.  
Stochastics (1M chart) crossed down from 100 at 0521 GMT.  
The MAs crossed down at 0522 at a price of 228.63. That would have been the entry. That price was never threatened after it made 9 pips profit (my spread).

It never ceases to amaze me how quickly so many of you are prepared to start modifying a system once it has been posted.As with most of TKimble's systems he stresses, #25 "simply follow the signals", but now we have MA's, Stochastics etc all in an attempt at perfection. I assume most of you are on demo because you wouldn't mess with this if you were for real.I've followed all of TKimbles threads and I believe he knows what he's on about and he is one of the few practitioners that has a simple approach to this difficult pursuit that actually works (if you don't mess with it).Just my 2 cents worth, probably all it's worth,but I really believe simple is best.

I definately agree. TK's system works fine as it is. The purpose of using nanningbob's strategy is to minimize the risk. (i.e. the 50 pip stop). According to nanningbob, he will enter a trade with a very small stop loss (10 pips) as long as his indicators line up. If he's wrong he is usually stopped out at breakeven (free trade). But when he's right he makes a decent profit with very limited risk.  
  
I think that should be the goal of every trader regardless of the system traded.  
  
In a nutshell, if you can make most of your wrong trades - _free trades_ \- then no matter what system you use you should come out on top.  
  
I also agree that we're gettin off topic, so I'll stop posting on this particular matter. Plus I'm going to bed.

**Don't fix it if it ain't broken!**  
  
I was reading hundreds or thousands of posts in the last weeks of great trading systems and setups here and in other forums.  
So many peoples putting their brains here, trying to find a way to beat the difficult Forex market. Tough enemy.  
So there are so many systems - better or worse - with different ways to attack the market depending of the temperament of each trader. Some like it hot and aggressive hanging 16 hours in front of their screens, some trade on dailies with a quick look on the charts in the morning.  
  
But one thing I have been observing is the following:  
  
* There is someone posting a new thread about a system he is using personally and successfully.  
* Then the thread gets busy and a lot of qualified guys (thats not ironic!) try to help and make the whole thing better.  
* After 1,000 post you barely have the originator of the system posting anymore as he still has his original chart and setup from post #1 still trading successfully.  
* After reading post 1,500 the whole system has changed to something completely different and nobody remembers the basic idea anymore and more post from peoples coming in asking what the hell is the right and best setup for this as there are soooo many different in the thread!  
  
Please, this is not to criticize the work and effort of all the great guys here trying to improve the trading methods. My personal conclusion is nevertheless:  
Choose a system which fits your trading style and temperament, read the post #1 of the thread and apply it. You will be fine!  
  
This thread is a perfect example. Read post #1. The rest is just fixing something that ain't broken!

I assume most of you are on demo because you wouldn't mess with this if you were for real.I've followed all of TKimbles threads and I believe he knows what he's on about and he is one of the few practitioners that has a simple approach to this difficult pursuit that actually works (if you don't mess with it).Just my 2 cents worth, probably all it's worth,but I really believe simple is best.

I'll trade it the way I want to.  
TK followed a rule tonight that wasn't posted, so I assume he'll trade it the way he wants to also.  
And, no, I'm not trading demo and I don't know what that has to do with anything.  
  
I'll agree the thread shouldn't have been cluttered with this. It wasn't my intent. I started by posting a thread with a refined entry method, that works for any system. It should have stopped there.

It is simply human nature to want to improve. Again, people who can do and people who can't, teach.  
  
My systems are designed to be simple. Lets keep it simple...

hi my indicator that i use is based on a similar thing to the way your using the histogram on the macd........take a look tell me what you think.  
  
I have traded a very similar system to this using my own indicator posted below. Some and most days it works like magic, but then there are days like the macd, and all oscillators for that matter, it lags and does not seem to follow the market well. But then i guess this is where your risk model comes into play.  
  
To be honest im trading your day and weekly systems using my indicator below for fine tuning of entry and exit (especially helpful in the exit of a trade), having good success with it. Are you still trading the weekly and daily systems?

Very well observed and very well put. I've been bothered by exactly the same thing. You rarely see the originators of these threads still actively involved in the threads they've started after 10 or 20 pages. It's very frustrating if you come into a thread a bit late and want to be able to ask some new questions, as the only people willing and able to answer are usually those who've somehow made the thread their own and are working off a vague facsimile of the original (usual simple) system.  
  
Now, I'm torn about this. On the one hand it's an expression of a free and evolving dynamic where seeds are planted and allowed to grow how they will. On the other hand it's symptomatic of a world where a lot of folks have way too much time on their hands (probably waiting for a four hour candle to close :-) and just spend that time messing with everything.  
  
Here's where it gets tricky for me, 'cos I'm a sucker for tinkering with everything _myself_ , so I can't be too judgemental. As soon as I'd built a "Trend Hugger" template, I was slapping pivots and fibs and bollingers and logical numbers and EMAs on it to try and "improve" it. What is _that_ about?? Why can't I just leave s*#t alone?  
  
After a while the tkimbles of this world leave us to get on with it.

What is the difference/preference in using the OsMA vs. MACD indicator? Also, what is the red line in the MACD that run along the bars? Thanks!

I find my weekly scalping system a bit boring and I need more action so I always gravitate back to my hourly trending systems. Most are proprietary that I will never released but I simply need the action.

Will you go long as soon as you see equal OSMA bars, without ever seeing a higher one?

A entered into a short trade with the OsMA headed down & price down. The next couple of OsMA bars were down. Why did I get stopped out? I thought this was only possible if the bars' value increased and changed direction? Please help!! Thanks.

TK,  
  
So far, you have given us, for free, very good weekly, daily, and now hourly (or whatever timeframe we want to use) systems. Please don't post any more new ones, I think I have all I need to be happy ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)   
  
The only tinkering I'm doing (couldnt help it) is to adjust some of the numbers in the OsMA indicator for certain pairs. More isn't needed. And no, other readers, I'm not telling you what I changed, do your own tinkering!!  
  
The weekly system still produces lots of profit in trending weeks.  
The daily system still produces profit during weeks that are ranging.  
  
Its all good! 

Disregard all prognostications.

BJ....Just because the OSMA bars go up or down doesn't mean you won't get stopped out. There are times that the bars go up and price stays flat or goes down. That is a divergence pattern on this indicator. Or OSMA goes down and price doesn't . Sometime this happens, and sometimes it can be extended. This system will have that issue, and therefore the initial stop (not the trailing one) is set at 50 pips. You do this to protect your capital and limit your risk. The good news is that when u enter your trade, more often it will take off in your direction and you can make 10 times that amount if you properly manage the trade, which means bringing the stop to Break even (BE ) after u reach 150 pips above your entry and then continue to manage it as price goes in your direction. Eventually, either your trailing stop will get hit, or you will receive an opposite signal, both of which should close your position.  
  
Maybe 4 out of 10 trades results in a 50 pip loss each. You will more than make up for that on the other 6.   
  
Look at how TK managed his last trade. He entered, trailed his stop and manged his trade. at one time he probably had almost a 300 pip profit, but he stuck to the system, and profited 125 pips. Now he is waiting for the next.

I would encourage u not to be worried about being stopped out. It is PART OF THE SYSTEM. Just trade it like it is outlined, and the results u will experience will make you happy....

Thanks, Jimno. I have a further question... Do you enter trades at the very top (high price - Short) and wait for the bottom of the valley (low price - long) or can you enter on the way up and down? It seems to me that if you have to wait for the absolute top and bottom, you will be waiting forever using the 1 hr. timeframe. Any advise. Thanks much!

The system as TK has outlined is based on his experience using a 1 hour timeframe. It works for him. Maybe this time frame doesn't work for you. I highlighted in **RED** something you said. A HUGE part of trading is the execution of the system u use. You need PATIENCE and Consistency to be successful in this business. Sounds like you may be wanting to jump in or out of the market too soon or late because u are having a hard time waiting for market to do its' thing after you put on a trade.   
  
Personally, i am still experimenting with different time frames. I normally trade on the 4hr/daily time frames, but this is another one of TK's addicting systems that gets me going. LOL. So i am looking at other time frames as well.   
  
But the golden standard in this thread is the 1 hr. I am back and forward testing this for myself, and it is really is TK's best system to date. Together, like in his other threads, the system may get tweeked because of great input and ideas from others on this thread.   
  
  
  
Goodtrading...

Ok Jimno... so when do you enter? At the very top (for a short) and very bottom (for a long). You do not enter on the way up or down, correct? Thanks.

When the OSMA bar changes direction, and that bar closes, you enter in that direction . Maybe price goes against u for a while and u are stopped out (50 pip) but u will do well in the long run. Make sense? Tk, please correct me if i have it wrong..

From looking through the past month of charts with the OsMA, the following pairs seem to be the best fit for this system. Some of the pairs will royally screw you --- gbpaud and the chf pairs for example.  
  
gbpjpy (still the very best in terms of profitability)  
nzdjpy  
eurjpy  
usdcad  
audusd (better on the 30 min chart) 

crapola

I had activated the automatic MT4 trailing stop.  
It added the spread onto the 227.21. The bid price would have actually had to hit 227.21 before it would have taken me out.

Still puzzled...the next bar can be only slightly down. Do you wait for the close of the first bar (in the opposite direction) and verification of the second bar (opening in the same changed direction) for entry? My point is that when you look at OsMA in real time, each bar is only slightly different when it changes direction. Do you look for a greater value change? So you can only enter at the top of an hour, correct? So if you get stopped out, do you have to wait until the current trend reverses (this would probably be many hours, right? Thanks.

I'm new to this thread today but this is what I was thinking as well. Interested in what those more experience have to say though.   
  
Also, for those who have been following this for a while, I went back and paper backtested all of this week for GBPJPY. Doesn't account for slippage as I was using the optimal entries and exits, but I show +761 pips. Does that sound right?

I think Sky has it right. Look at his post just above and very nice screen shot that shows it. Let see if i can answer some other questions.   
  
1\. Enter at the close of the first bar showing an OSMA (not price) in the oppostie direction, there is no verification of the second bar. Or you could say enter right at the OPen of the bar following the change.  
  
2\. The amount of change of the OSMA bar may help you recoqnize when the signal bar may come, but wait for the close of the bar. TK also will consider it a signal when the OSMA bars are equal.   
  
3\. Yes, for the 1 hr system, you would enter at the top of an hour when a signal is received.  
  
4\. I don't think TK has answered what he does if he is stopped out, and how would get back in. TK? I know what i do, but i am still looking at 2 different ways.   
  
Hope this helps...

> BJ....Just because the OSMA bars go up or down doesn't mean you won't get stopped out. There are times that the bars go up and price stays flat or goes down. That is a divergence pattern on this indicator. Or OSMA goes down and price doesn't . Sometime this happens, and sometimes it can be extended. This system will have that issue, and therefore the initial stop (not the trailing one) is set at 50 pips. You do this to protect your capital and limit your risk. The good news is that when u enter your trade, more often it will take off in your direction and you can make 10 times that amount if you properly manage the trade, which means bringing the stop to Break even (BE ) after u reach 150 pips above your entry and then continue to manage it as price goes in your direction. Eventually, either your trailing stop will get hit, or you will receive an opposite signal, both of which should close your position.

Without question, this is a great system. Does anyone have any thoughts as to whether an EA could be programmed based on the parameters outlined? If one could be made, it would obviously save chart watching at the hour change, or when one is asleep.

I agree its a great system. I've been testing a few pairs and it seems to work better on some than others from my limited back testing. It's great for the G/J which can be a bit stressful ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f633.png?v=15.1). It seems ideal for an EA. Trading it this week o the G/J would have resulted in great pips and a lot more sleep.

i don't think so. I use a treo 650 when i am away from my computer and use IB FX wireless system. It is the wireless version of Metatrader v 4 and is absolutely great...however it doesn't support custom indicators (YET) . I can do everything on it and have used the MACD instead which is a standard indicator that it does support.

Thx Tkimble , but I remember when I coded your Daily Scalping EA , that you didn't like the EA for that reason I opened another post to speak about.   
So now are you changing your mind about EA ? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
Edit : Btw just because are you , if you want I'll be glad to give a 1 on 1 tutorial on how to set metatrader to works properly with EA ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

How do you write an alert for a color change in OsMA ?  
Also the divergence issue,   
Just get out if you're in.  
Or, why not play it by watching for price to correct in the direction of the dominant trend and then enter? Any thoughts?  
thanks in advance

Just started testing this system yesterday. I have made 2 rookie mistakes so far:  
  
1\. Last night before I went to bed at about 6:00 GMT, it really looked like it was going to turn and the bars were close to equal. So I went ahead and went long. I was right as it did finally turn at 11:00 GMT, but I got wicked out of my 50 pip stop in the 7:00 GMT hour. Too bad as I'd be up 174 pips. Need to learn patience. An EA or alert that would wake us up when it turns would be huge for this.  
  
2\. Since I'm just testing, I decided to watch all the JPY crosses. NZDJPY is developing a signal in the current hour (13:00 GMT) but I got so excited about the change that I went in early, not remembering to wait until the bar closes / open of the next one. Jury is still out on that one but is -19 right now.

Hi Rialto,   
yes I'm trading looking at that chart without any other indicator, I think there's no need to put other indicator in chart for this method.

there is something missing from this system.  
i have been using macd for quite some time now and i have to tell you this about macd histogram (or osma, it is the same thing): no matter what settings you use, there will always be times when you see divergences (either classical or hidden). so let's talk about this.  
a hidden divergence is the best opportunity to open a new position in the same direction as the main trend, so i'm not talking about this particular case. you make profit using the original rules.  
a very different situation happens when you see a classical divergence: you can't just trade it the way tk proposed in the original rules, because in this case price will always goes into the other direction. i mean, sure you can trade it, but wouldn't you better keep that 50 pips SL in your pocket?  
here's an example about what i am trying to say. g-j, h4. i am only talking about entry points, the value of SL/TP/TS is a different story...  
look at the blue vertical lines: you are buying on tops and selling on bottoms if you are using the original rules. all are fake signals.  
now look at the trendline: price is below it; then look at CCI, it is mostly below 0 (these are actually the 2 filters i wanted to suggest - trendlines and CCI).   
think about it.  
  
p.s. the vertical red line is an entry that would have brought just a few pips, probably less than 50 (after you move SL to b/e with 150 pips rule). you have 5 fake entries, and only one winner.

there is a beautiful setup on this h4 chart. bearish hidden divergence on osma...   
as soon as price breaks that trendline, take the short signal given by osma. it should bring you a very nice profit.

Not bad for my first day. I don't like holding over the weeekend and I didn't hear back on my query regarding that so I closed everything yesterday afternoon. That said, excluding the trades above, I closed the day up 118 pips.   
  
Had profitable trades on AUDJPY, AUDUSD, EURJPY, EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDCAD, USDCHF. Only one loser (3 pips) on CHFJPY. And that was likely just due to exiting at market close.

Scrat, nice seeing u again.   
  
U are so right about the divergence issue. We traders are a funny bunch as we try and refine things to make it work. I am doing the same as you. Trendline filter, MA filter, etc. The problem as i see it is that we (me) fail to see the big picture, and afraid to take a loss.   
  
Looking at the 4 hr GBY (that is what i trade personally as well) U show the 4 losers which is true but just before those is an 800 pip and 400 pip winner. And the current trade will be a winner too. From my calculations the winners significantly offset the losers. I need to finish my REAL backtest so i have a much better understanding of proformance. As much as i can tell, this is a very profitable system. So i am very hesitant to start changing a profitable system to just optimize it.   
  
BUT...can it be tweeked to rid us of some of those pesky false signals (see i am aready complicating it..!) ???  
  
Here is my thoughts on filters: I just have a hard time being a mechanical trader.   
  
1\. On a signal, take the breakout of that bar instead of close of it. i find that even a nice trend will have a rogue bar in the opposite direction, and this tends to help you stay in the trade and not take the false signal, just to have to take another signal on the next bar. Saves 2 [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide"). Real signals (like the last one on the 4 hr) are only impacted a bit.  
  
2\. Should we always be in market? I won't be in the market against a trend that i believe is continuing. So in those cases i don't take any signals in that direction. If i am in, i might get out, but i won't go in the opposite direction. That is discretionary on my part. If we are range bound, then i will go both ways. I will also look at price patterns. The chart you had showed a very nice higher low indicating a long may be appropriate.   
  
What i appreciate about this system is that it is simple and works. In fact, i am coming to believe that simplicity is a major factor in a traders success. So i am keeping that and only want to add a few discretionary items to tweek it more to my advantage. TK continually encourages us all to "make it your own".   
  
THanks for your observations.. ALso, for those trading the 4 hr/ daily/ weekly. I think 50 pip stop is too low. It works very well for the 1 hr time frame.

when i first read about a system, i don't look where it works but where it doesn't.   
this one is another trend following system and it will bring nice profits (as always) as long as we see a trend; so i don't bother with the profitable trades. what about when we don't have a trend, or when trend is changing? these are the conditions that will bring drawdowns, and before i use this system i would need to focus on these situations.   
most of you will probably say this: well, if the profits are big enough to compensate for the drawdowns, why bother? yes, true. but how do we know that we will have enough profits? we don't! and if you think about backtesting, it won't work; from my experience, backtesting is not relevant enough no matter how far you go in the past. it won't tell you about the future, because market conditions are constantly evolving. take this from a guy who spent weeks after weeks of backtesting.   
the only thing that works is MINIMIZE LOSSES, because you never know what your profits would be in the future. this is what this thread should be talking about.

and now some comments on what you said.  
the breakout entry is a very good point. i always do this because i believe it is safer.  
no, we shouldn't always be in market. there are ranging & choppy conditions when it is better to stay out. i am a swing trader and i only feel comfortable "at large". now...   
that 50 pips SL doesn't work for g-j on h4 at all. i'm not even sure it works on h1 because most of the times i set stops of about 80-90 pips on this timeframe.  
there are many more things to discuss, but i don't think this is the place. this is not my strategy and if i come up with any change i consider important, it won't look at all like the original setup.   
  
p.s. by the way, i didn't find anything about this: after you are stopped, what is next? a new entry according to the rules? or just stand aside until...?

Don't know what TK does as he hasn't said yet. I've looked at reentering at the breakout of the bar when the indicator has turned back to the main trend direction. I'm not happy with that though. Seems like too much risk for me.

Some OsMA clarification if I could.  
  
My platform doesn't have OsMA, though it does have MACD, from what I gather they are similar.  
  
Could someone please tell me exactly how the OsMA is calculated so that I can take a shot at coding it (or modifying a MACD code).  
  
Thanks

OsMA should be equivalent to MACD histogram.   
or you can always install MT for free.

This looks like a nice system that will make consistent profits. Does anyone know about how many pips per month on average on the GBP/JPY this system makes on the hourly, 4 hr and daily time frames? Good stuff. I'm going to check out tkimbles other systems as well especially the daily one. This dude seems to really know his stuff!!! And I'm looking for a good daily system ( or at least 4 hr) to use for long term trading. Thanks, Paris

if you want a good system on a long term, why don't you try elder's triple screen? you can go with h4/daily, or even better with daily/weekly. but in this case, you'd have to stay out of volatile pairs or go with a very low margin per trade.

Just took this short trade on USDCHF last night. It's down right now but not stopped. What I did notice however was that on each of the last 2 downtrends, the signal was divergent. The short is also going against the long term trend. So I'm wondering if this would be a good (albeit discretionary) way to avoid bad trades?

hi there,  
  
a trader i know who helps me out with my trading says momentum trading does not pay in the long run and thinks value trading is the way to go.  
  
what do people on here think of that statement as most of tk systems are momentum trading (i assume anyway)?

Divergence should help the trade, not hurt it.

In the chart I posted above, the last two times the oSMA reverses to the downside, the price continues it's upward march. How is that beneficial?  
  
In terms of long term trend, I'm just looking at the price that's displayed. "Long term" being the 5 days showed on this chart.

Hi tkimble,  
  
What would be used for a stop loss and trailing stop on the GBP/JPY on the 4 hr tf? And on the daily? Thanks, Paris

This may have been answered but I don't remember seeing it. When you are in a trade, but not stopped out, and the signal changes, what do you do.  
  
A. Exit the trade and open oen in the other direction  
B. Exit the trade and not re-enter  
C. Stay in the trade.  
  
I have been whipsawed today by CHFJPY when doing A.

You would exit and enter a new trade in the opposite direction. There are only two ways to exit a trade - either your stop loss/trailing stop is hit or you get a reverse signal.  
  
I agree that we need a filter for ranging markets. Some say that by taking every signal your profits from riding trends with the trailing stop will overshadow the numerous 50 pip losers....time will tell.  
  
Also in regards to re-entering a trade after being stopped out. My interpretation is that you would need to wait for the next _reverse_ signal. For example, if I was long and got stopped out, I would have to wait for the next short signal to appear. My reasoning for this is taken from Post #3 which states that you are "simply selling the peaks and buying at the trough" of the MACD or OsMA indicators. So if we went long at the trough of the OsMA/MACD indicator and got stopped out but the bars kept climbing higher then I could not enter long because we were no longer at the trough, we would now have to wait for a short signal at the next peak of the OsMA/MACD indicator.

Has any body had success trading this system on a daily chart? Just by looking at the charts, it appears that it would work very well on daily charts on multiple pairs.   
  
If anybody has used this system on a daily tf, I'd be interested to know what pairs you've traded, and what your stops and profit targets are.

This tk method is relatively new it was only posted recently, so there hasn't been sufficient time to have been successfully trading it, unless ofcourse someone has been using the same method for the last couple of years.

from this my understanding is (1) only exit when stopped out (no TP) (2) stop and reverse on change of direction of osma/macd bars  
  
good money management will take care of the whipsaws and rough periods.  
  
all the best.

Thank you for saying what I was thinking as I was reading this thread. TK's explanation turned on lights...bells and whistles for me. Then come all the other people throwing their 2 cents. You should please start another thread and stop making the water murky for the new people![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1). If he says "BUY" at the color change...then "BUY" if he says "SELL" at the color change then sell. If you are a genius with an IQ over 140, and want to talk rocket science...then please go start another thread. Otherwise leave the system alone. You guys turned a simple system completely upside down for me...thanks...I am going to have nightmares about stochs, and ema's, and this crossing that, and if a tree falls in the forest...but has to fall north and not south...does anyone hear it?? MAN...god bless you guys and all your knowledge...but ease up and leave the easy threads easy, and go start your own rocket science thread some where else...I am sorry for venting ..but I went from happy to read this thread to very irritated in a matter of about 7 pages. Jeeeeesh...please stop the bleeding!![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f621.png?v=15.1) Unless you designed the system...let the system inventor create the rules please!![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f621.png?v=15.1)

I assume most of you are on demo because you wouldn't mess with this if you were for real.I've followed all of TKimbles threads and I believe he knows what he's on about and he is one of the few practitioners that has a simple approach to this difficult pursuit that actually works (if you don't mess with it).Just my 2 cents worth, probably all it's worth,but I really believe simple is best.

tk, im very surprised this is your most profitable method..........I traded a very similar system and found that to follow price is always better in the long run than to use a indicator as a primary tool the way you are doing, but hey thats just my opinion don't want to offend people.

First, my apologies to those who are losing it about people tweaking this fine system. I guess I thought that's what these forums were for.  
  
I've been trading this on the daily charts, and the way I've been avoiding whipsaws is to overlay 90-day linear regression lines on the chart. These lines will automatically and neatly show you the way the market is trending. I then only take trades in the direction of the trend.  
  
It's working so far.

it is my understanding that you enter either after the close of the new color (change of direction) or at the opening of the second new color bar. It seems that by waiting, you are missing out on an hours worth of the new price direction , thus a lot of profit. Am I missing something? Thanks, all.

Where might I find the 90-day linear regression trend indicator? Don't see it on my MT4 platform.  
Thnx, Sid

The linear regression indicator is one I picked up along the way. If you search for it you can find it. It can be set for any # of periods, but 90 works for me on daily chart.  
  
If you will give me a quick lesson on how to post an MT4 chart I will try. Thanks!

I'm trying to avoid whipsaws by trading in only one direction, and the slope of the linear regression gives me an objective standard to decide which way to trade. I tried an 89 SMA first, but I think the regression lines are better.  
  
It's working so far. Not every trade gains, and some gains are bigger than others, but at least my transaction costs are reduced by not taking trades both ways. Does anyone smarter than me see anything conceptually wrong with this method?

I like this idea a lot. I have been doing something similar, though just by eyeballing the price trend.   
  
Can you post the indicator file you're using to draw your regression lines? It looks to be different than the one posted above.   
  
The file should be in:

Thanks that works great. Do you just use the default values or do you customize based on timeframe and/or pair?

I'm using 90 days to define a trend on the daily chart. Obviously the greater the slope the better off you are. Look at EUR/USD's slope for the last 90 days and imagine catching the upswings.

Hello Banzai,  
  
I've noticed in other threads that you have a real talent for creating alerts, templates and indicators. I was wondering if you have created an alert for the Colored OsMa Indicator you posted here. A sound alert when the OsMa bars change color would be so helpful to avoid having to check the charts every hour. Thanks Banzai!! ....T-Wolf

I'm trading the H1 chart so I set it for 96 to start with (4 days). We'll see. Looking back it looks like it would have kept me out of some bad trades but I'd have also missed a couple of pretty good ones.   
  
But I'm intrigued by it. I also threw CCI up there ... someone else in the thread mentioned that one as a possible filter as well.

What does everyone do if they have a trade on and it's bedtime? The indicator (OsMA) could change direction and color, and you wouldn't know (i.e. sleeping). DO you move the S/L to break even to avoid loss thus preservation of capital? or let it run and see in the morning? Thanks.!!

I know this is off the current topic, but for the thread, if anyone uses the GFT platform, i have attached two OsMA indicators....  
  
the first is a simple green to red change of colour when bar values change trend  
  
the second is green above 0, red below, with different shades on change of trend (as per the indicator posted for mt4 earlier in this thread)  
  
and.... a screen shot.... i'm upload happy.

That's great, I like that!  
  
Now add an audio alert (for MT Platform) and I'll be even happier ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
  
I have yet to make money using this system but I see the back test results and am definetely going to give it a good trial run.

I use Dealbook not MT platforms, so wouldn't have a clue how to code MQL.  
This was my first foray into playing with code, so happy I made it work.  
  
Dealbook has Audio, SMS and Email alerts built in for price and indicators.... all there to be used.

I'm certainly no MQL guru but here is my attempt at adding Alerts and Email to the OsMA Color Indicator.   
  
Inputs Added:  
  
AlertOn: You want MT4 alerts  
EmailOn: You want MT4 to send email as configured in the platform  
  
Logic:  
All this does is compare the most recent closed bar (so 1 bar ago) to the one before that. If the color is different, it generates an alert/email that says the color changed. At that point it's up to you to do any other due diligence, wait for another bar to close, etc.  
  
Also, the alerting logic only runs once per bar, not per tick. So on the first tick of a newly opened bar, it looks at the prior two bars to detect a color change. It does not look at the newly opened bar at all. I thought of making sure it was the same color as the most recently closed bar, but decided not to as I think a lot of people are trading this system differently than others.  
  
I have done only the most rudimentary testing on this so YMMV.

Has anyone done a back test on this system for the last 5 years? I just checked out a great system and from 1 year ago Dec. 2006 to Dec. 2007 it made +4889 pips on the GBP/JPY daily time frame. However the year before that it actually lost -667 pips in all of 12 months before this 2007 profitable year. That's why a system might be great this year but how did it do previous years? A five year test is the minimum to test. Paris

hold on to those panties, Paris !  
  
hey, maybe a system will work in alternate years !![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
  
the thing is nobody can tell coz the market itself and the conditions will change, even the primary trend will change since a currency can't keep going down or up no end........

hi trader x if you didnt get the linear regression working you might have been doing the same thing i was doing, and putting the setting in the wrong spot.  
you should change the lr length setting not the period. does anyone know what that seting does?  
by the way thanks killertrader for the indicator, looks good.

I wish I was...but I got out. I guess that is just a lesson to trust the simple system!!!

If the next bar is down (negative), we will have a signal to go short, correct?

Besides gbpjpy, what pairs are people finding profitable with this system? In particular, those folks that are in the US where London open is not easy to stay up for.

Tradergeek, this has worked well for me, thanks for posting. One proposed change though... Can you have modify it so that it does NOT alert you when it cross zero at a change of color? This is an exception as it is not a change in direction but simply moving beyond the zero line.

my charts don't reflect that but the data feeds always differ....

from a TA perspective, not that this system uses it, it looks like a descending triangle, support around low 2.0200's

well it has signalled now, because the previous bar adjusts it shows now that it signalled 1 hour ago... this makes me wonder about back testing, it won't be very accurate which is a shame.

One thing for sure, this is a TKimble method...he knows his stuff. Just follow the rules the way he intended them and you can't go wrong. As evidenced by his daily and weekly methods. Anyway, it looks like GJ might rebound after the news release. At 1330 GMT Trade balance for US is released. Should be joke as usual...look for it to go through the roof! Is there ever any positive data releases from the US anymore. Are we still a power house? Not where our dollar is concerned!

Does this system work on any other pairs? The GBP/JPY spread is 9pips (IBFX). Very steep! Any thoughts out there? Thanks.

i see no reason why it couldn't be used on any pair. if you pull the MACD/OSMA up on any pair, any timeframe it does the same thing.  
  
what you could do for example, is look at all the major pairs, on timeframes that suit you, and see which ones have nice clean trades (not too many swings)  
  
obviously this would be ongoing as the behaviour changes on the different pair/timeframe combinations.  
  
all the best!

I have not experienced this, but I do get the one "false alert" when the bars cross through the zero mark as the color technically changes but in this process, we are only concerned with bars that change direction, i.e. light green to dark green.

If there is an EA for this system can someone please direct me to it or post it on this thread if it hasn't been already ? I've read the whole thread and have not come across an EA....although I may have overlooked it....

you may be getting alerts every time the bar changes colour!  
  
as it crosses the previous bar price it will fluctuate while the price bounces around near that price, then once it moves far enough past in either direction it will stop.

I've noticed this as well. If I get some time I'll see if I can code around that and only alert on a direction change.   
  
I have not seen the false alerts myself but that doesn't mean they don't exist.

I've been testing the system for two weeks now. Using a live account but with micro lots (.10 / pip). So consider it a live demo. Here are my results for the two weeks:  
  
Total Pips: 817  
  
Week 1: 434   
Week 2: 383   
  
**By pair**  
  
_Week 1_  
GBPUSD 279   
EURUSD 75   
USDCHF 75  
USDJPY 55  
GBPJPY -50  
  
_Week 2_  
GBPJPY 224  
GBPCHF 130  
USDJPY 109  
GBPUSD 19  
EURGBP 7  
EURUSD -40  
USDCHF -66  
  
Max Drawdown: 200 pips  
  
Two weeks is not much of a sample size but its enough for me to really like the system. I'm going to crank it up to 1 mini lot and run it for a few more weeks. Assuming all goes well I'll then put some real $ into it.  
  
Thanks TKimble for a great system.

Thanks for posting your results.  
  
Are you using a 50 pip SL on this test? If so; is that 200 pip DD across the board on all open positions at any one time? Could you please clarify?  
  
Thanks again!

50 pip SL, but I will exit before that if the signal reverses. The drawdown is based on closed trades, so 4 losers in a row for example if they were all stopped out at 50 pips. I think it was more like 6 losers in a row but some were closed before the 50 pip mark.   
  
I didn't keep track of drawdown for open trades so I suppose it could have been more than the 200 at one point or another.

This never was made clear. He said roughly what you are saying, at one time. Then later he seemed to say something different.

I paid an EA programmer to program this for us. What's a couple hundred dollars if you can make thousands right? Anyways I want to thank Tkimble for his system first of all and for sharing his knowledge with us. What a cool guy. Hopefully he sees this thread and will download the EA as a gift. I'll send him a message too. The orders will open up when the EA is initialized in the direction of the OSMA color. The EA will close the order once your stop loss is triggered, take profit triggered, or if the OSMA color changes and it will close the existing order and then open up a reverse order in the direction of the OSMA change. Its done pretty good for me so far but I am using a demo account. I like to activate it before the London opening and go to sleep because if you notice the past couple weeks that is the period some major moves are made. The EA has worked pretty good so far.   
  
I like to use the 30 min charts since the OSMA colors to change that much and am able to catch a move sooner than the 1 hour charts.   
  
Here are the pairs I run the EA on simultaneously there are probably more but these are the ones I use:  
  
AUD/USD  
GBP/CHF  
GBP/JPY  
GBP/USD  
EUR/USD  
USD/CHF  
  
I didn't program this so don't ask me to change it. Maybe a EA programmer like Skyline can adjust it if needed but it works pretty good. The only thing I'd like to hear from you guys is how its working for you.   
  
Thanks again Tkimble YOU ROCK!!

Smak74,   
  
Thanks for posting this! I have a couple questions.  
  
1) Does the EA open on the first closed bar of a color change or as soon as color changes?  
2) Are the trading times based on GMT, broker time or local time?

1) The EA opens on the first closed bar so if you set it for 30 minutes it will open/close an order on every half hour.   
  
2) The time is based of the broker's time.  
  
  
Good luck!

Overall, it works very well! I used 150 pip TS and 65 pip SL in my testing. One problem though that would prevent me from using it live:  
  
"The orders will open up when the EA is initialized in the direction of the OSMA color."   
  
This causes the EA to open a trade immediately upon initialization as it doesn't wait for a fresh signal. Also, if a trade hit the SL but the direction hasn't changed, it will open up another trade. This deviates from tkimble's method by buy at the highs and selling at the troughs. I did find it to cause some major drawdown at times due to multiple losses in a row. If the SL gets hit multiple times, and the direction hasn't changed, chances are the market is too volatile and it is best to stay out.   
  
If this is an intended feature, can you or someone with MQ4 programming experience add a "enter on fresh signal" option?  
  
Thanks again for posting this, that was very generous of you.

I see what you mean unfortunately I can't program it in. Maybe someone here can adjust. In choppy days on 30 min the color changes too much and since the EA closes out your existing orders and opens up a reverse order when the color changes. This loses us money. It is best to use the EA on a 1hr chart where the color doesn't change so frequently an when it does it is usually with the trend. This is Tkimbles preferred trade time anyways.

I'm really referring to when the color hasn't changed. If it stops out, and the color is still the same, it will open up an order at the next bar. In other words, there will always be a continuous trade opened up. Instead, if a trade gets stopped out, it should wait for the next color change and open it in that direction. This is mostly observed when initially attaching the EA to the chart as it will immediately open a trade at the next bar -- it should wait for a fresh signal (reversal in the color).

I do not get any trades when I try to backtest this EA?

Is anyone having luck running the EA? Maybe the settings are wrong? Any ideas out there?

The EA does work and I had trades open on back testing --- everyone wiped out my account regardless of the settings. The issue is that it opens a trade as soon as one hits SL which is not a good idea. Also, it opens up a trade everytime metatrader starts (after first closed candle).

It's been a rough week for TrendHugger in general thus far. EA or not. Market is ranging ... lots of whipsaw for me.

Agree, london session was horrible. i got stopped out several times in a row. looking back over time, this was extremely rare to have this type of volatility. I have seen small ranges where OsMA reverses but the reversals are small pip amounts and are during low volume trading times.

I went long on gbpjpy about an hour ago, we'll have to see how it does. Right now it's down slightly. I'm curious how tkimble did at the start of this week.

if you double click or right click on it on NAVIGATOR->EA-> MODIFY on it it opens metaeditor and beginning looks like this, which is self-explanatory. i don't know about programming.   
  
  
you can back-test it.   
unfortunately results are alwasy negative (as CRAPOLA said), profit factor is btw 0.5-0.8 (it means you LOSE MONEY), for reasons discussed at at pages 18-19 of the thread.  
sorry SMAK74, method is good, but indicator doesn't work like it is supposed to do, because of color change in the middle of the OsMA bars.  
please don't use it live in current form otherwise you will lose all of your account. Try demo for 1 month, you have nothing to lose this way.

I downloaded the Trend Hugger EA and put it on my chart. I am trading the GBY/JPY and no trades have triggered. Is there a specific start time for the EA to take effect? Is anyone out there having success with the EA? If so, what pairs? drawdowns, etc. Thank you.

Here's an EA I developed using Expert Advisor Builder.   
  
Its been set to look for a peak and valley, then buy and sell accordingly.   
  
Peak: The past three bars are as follows: 1<2>3  
Valley: The past three bars are as follows: 1>2<3

Here is a similar version, the main difference is that you can change the OSMA values.  
  
  
  
  
The main problem with this system is that it looks at only the past three bars. I'm thinking the strongest signals come after a relatively long trend (5 bars or more). However, I'll leave that up to you. I don't want to deviate too much from the original system.

Hi Ronald,   
Is it possible to make a similar EA, but based on MACD not on OsMA.

Well, here's what I'm doing with it.   
  
I just put it on any chart under 1 hr. (30 min, 15 min, etc.), but get the OSMA/MACD reading from the 1 hr chart. That way, it checks for a reversal at specific intervals, (1 min, 5 min, etc.) Hopefully that can reduce whipsawing.   
  
If you would like to make your own variations, google "Expert Advisor Builder" It's a fairly simple interface, and is perfect for those small and relatively simple trading systems: something tkimble is famous for. That's what I use to make the foundation of my EAs, I use my own coding skills to tweak it.   
  
Tkimble mentioned something about MACD/OSMA being equal and therefore triggering a signal. If that really is a stronger signal, then can someone please elaborate on how it works? Where is the equal portion on the 3 bar reversal signal? On the current bar?

Heres my understanding of the "equal bars" rule:  
  
I'll use an example for going long:  
  
If the OSMA trend is down;  
followed by two bars of equal value;  
and now the current bar is up (meaning that it is higher than the two equal bars);  
then you can enter long BEFORE THE CLOSE of the current bar.  
  
The reason for this, according to TK, is that once the current bar CLOSES HIGHER it usually causes the second bar, of the two equal bars, to CHANGE ITS VALUE HIGHER. I believe this concept is called "repainting".  
  
You're essentially anticipating that the previous bar will repaint itself higher, thus giving you a proper entry signal.

Based on your explanation, I'm basically looking for the same setup as in my other EAs, but instead of looking at the shape at the close of the bar, I look at the current value.  
  
For example, a "BUY" signal means that the past 3 bars are (1 is current)   
1>2<3 for BOTH the MACD and OSMA, and both the MACD and OSMA are equal.   
  
For a "SELL" signal, the past three bars are 1<2>3 , and both MACD and OSMA are equal.   
  
  
Did I get that right? If so, I'll set up an EA which will look only for those signals. If they really are more powerful, it may improve the system.

If I were to write the "equal bar" rule into a program (and I'm no programer!) I would format it into something like this:  
  
Note: I would use 4 bars. Bar 1 is the current bar. Bars 2 and 3 are the "equal bars". Bar 4 is the bar before bar 3 which we will use to determine the trend _prior to the "equal bars" formation_. Also, when I talk about bars, I'm talking about the OsMA/MACD bars - not price bars.  
  
Enter long if:  
  
4 > 3 _and_ 3 = 2 _and_ 2 < 1  
  
You're basically looking for a "U" shaped formation where Bar 4 is the left side, Bars 3 and 2 are the middle arch, and Bar 1 is the right side.  
  
I also must stress that this is _my interpretation_ of the "equal bars" rule from TK's Post #112 and confirmed in Posts #118 and #119. Also I don't recall TK saying that this signal was more powerful then a simple reversal - I believe he said that it just allows you to get a jump on an anticipated reversal signal. Obviously this has the advantage of getting in with a better price/stop though.

Lincoln,   
  
Based on your response, I'll assume that this other signal explained by TKimble looks for a 4 bar "U" as opposed to a 3 bar "V"  
  
  
So, a buy signal is (1 is current bar):  
  
1>2  
2=3  
3<4  
  
  
A sell signal is:  
  
1<2  
2=3  
3>4  
  
  
  
Here is an explanation of the variable:   
  
OSMA_PeriodMinutes = 60; The time in minutes that you want the OSMA to be based on.   
  
  
The rest should be self-explanatory.   
  
  
  
Let's assume that I wanted this EA to use the 1 hr chart, and look for the "U" formation every 15 mins.   
  
I would open up a 15min chart, attach this EA, and make sure that the OSMA_PeriodMinutes is set to 60 (60 minutes = 1 hour).  
  
Lincoln, is that what you're looking for?

I like the comparison that we're looking for a "U" shape as opposed to the usual "V" shape. That's correct.  
  
I also like that you're checking the charts every 15 minutes so that we have a chance to get in the trade up to 45 minutes before the close of the bar...nice.

Thank you Lincoln,  
  
If everyone interested in this new version could try it out in a forward test with their desired parameters (OSMA time, chart time, etc.) I'm sure we could move ahead and improve the EA, I have this running on my server as:  
  
1 HR OSMA  
15 min chart.   
  
We'll see how well it works in a month or so.

I think it should be:  
1>2  
2>=3  
3<4  
  
and   
  
1<2  
2<=3  
3>4  
  
In any case, I ran a back test and no trades opened on the 15 min chart. The original EA made plenty of trades, even though it wasn't based completely on tkimble's logic.

A few days ago there was a ranging period that gave quite a bit of false signals. I am testing out using an indicator that incorporates bollinger bands along with the CCI. Notice the attached chart has the period grayed out. This will allow us to ignore false entries. CCI will keep diversion in check too. Execute a buy when CCI is above or cross above zero and a sell when CCI is below or crosses below zero.   
  
Attached is the indicator. For settings: set graph type to 3, CCI period to 24.

The reason why it didn't open trades I think was because it was looking for the 1 hr OSMA data, which it couldn't get because you were on a different chart. What was your OSMA_Period value?  
  
Also, your bar configuration I think combines the two signals ("U" and "V" shapes), but lags the whole system by one bar.   
  
Instead, I think you are looking for a:  
  
BUY:   
  
1>2  
2<=3  
3<4  
  
SELL:  
  
1<2  
2>=3  
3>4  
  
  
Your method looked primarily for a "U" signal, this modified version looks primarily for a "V" signal.

I put it on the 15m chart and left OSMA_period default at 60.

The main reason why I think it is not working on a backtest is because the 1 hr OSMA data isn't readily available. My coding isn't smart enough to do that yet.   
  
It did open a trade earlier on a 30 MIN OSMA with 1 min chart so I know it works.   
  
As for combining the two methods, I figure it is best to keep them separate. I don't think I can program each individual scenario together anyway.

I don't know how the backtests are conducted but I should note that if the backtest relies on looking at historical charts then you wont get many signals. The reason for this is because of the repainting that takes place after an "equal bar" signal is given.  
  
For example lets say Bar 4's value equals .00028, Bar's 3 and 2 equal .00025, and bar 1 currently equals .00027. This is a valid signal. However now lets say bar 1 _closes_ at .00027. If we were to look back at bar 2 it may not have the same value of .00025 that it originally had, it may be .00026 because of the _repainting_. Basically the higher closing value of bar 1 has changed the value of bar 2 even though it had already closed.   
  
Therefore if you were to look back at a historical chart for this particular trade bar 4 would equal .00028, bar 3 would equal .00025, bar 2 would equal .00026, and bar 1 would equal .00027. You would never know that bars 3 and 2 had once been equal!  
  
This is the essence of the "equal bars" rule, because bar 2 can change its value after the fact, and thus making it the actual reversal bar. If we were to wait for the close of bar 1 we would actually be entering _two bars late_ once bar 2 repaints itself higher!

**BUY:**  
  
**1 >2**  
**2 <=3**  
**3 <4**  
  
**SELL:**  
  
**1 <2**  
**2 >=3**  
**3 >4**  
  
Can we make this into an EA? It looks like it incorporates both "V" and "U" trades nicely. The only quirk I see is that it looks for at least 3 bars (4, 3 and 2) to be trending up or down prior to a "V" reversal - which may not be such a bad filter anyway. Heck, just add two more bars (5 and 6) and you'll have your 5 bar filter that you mentioned earlier...nice.

I have been reading this thread and about demo trading this system. Please can I be clarified about one thing? Will there be a Macd positive or negative divergence before one stands loking for the difference in signal values? the good work that you all are doing here is appreciated.  
  
Have a wonderful merry xmas

The readout on the MACD is exactly the same shape as the OSMA. The main difference is the position relative to 0.   
  
All we're looking for on each indicator is when the slope changes from positive to negative.   
  
Lincoln, I suspect the amount of bars doesn't matter. In looking back over the charts manually, I'm seeing signals which led to strong trends with only 2 bars separating signals. So that probably isn't the solution.   
  
Attached are both Equal bar OSMA versions which either look for the "U" shape first, or the "V" shape first.

I really hope this thread doesn't die. I want to continue learning from others on this system and how they are doing. I started trading live last week and have followed a method that filters divergence which appears to be the main issue here. Otherwise, this system appears to be extremely profitable. I think the discussions around EA's are fine and I like them as well but I don't want to lose the main focus here which is the methodology that TK outlined for us.   
  
I'm using the OsMA as designed but when we get a period of low volatility there are numerous false signals. Looking out for narrow bollinger bands seem to keep divergence in check and the CCI helps with good entries. If you look at a previous chart I posted, the gray areas in the bollinger squeeze indicator correspond with the narrow bands. However, you can miss a good break out while bands are still narrow. At this point, I will look at CCI (set to 24) and watch for it to near the 200 mark. Even during narrow bands, this yields very little false signals. Had I traded strictly by the OsMA, I would have had 6+ false entries in a row, but with the bollinger squeeze indicator, it would have only been 2.

crapola,   
  
I applaud your efforts at making this trading system stronger. Here's my bit:   
  
TKimble mentioned somewhere I think on the weekly strategy that he wants his strategies as simple as possible. To me, simple is something that I can program relatively easily. I'm a 17 year old kid trying to generate some passive income. I have to juggle school, my internship, college applications, chores, etc all day. I probably have about 1-2 hours for trading. Hardly enough time as I see it. That's why I'm so intent on using EAs. They trade better than I can as long as they follow a winning strategy.   
  
Based on your chart and explanation of your strategy, it seems like a good idea to filter out the sideways market.   
  
Now, could you set some hard rules for your system? I don't quite understand how the bollinger squeeze works. As far as I can tell, it looks like it searches for sideways markets. The thing is, HOW does it do that?

Ronald Raygun and crapola... keep up the fine work to arrive at an improved EA for this system.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
I agree that simple is best, however if false signals can be filtered out then I consider it worthwhile to do so.  
I'm eagerly awaiting a new EA that does this effectively.

One way of determining the bollinger squeeze is to look for when Bollinger Bands (20,2) trade inside Keltner Channels (20,1.5). You would not trade while they are in this area as it means there is very low volatility.   
  
There's more to the squeeze play than this but since we're only looking to avoid periods of low volatility, the above info is all we need.  
  
Heres a simplified equation to use to know when to avoid trades:  
  
Upper Bollinger Band Channel < Upper Keltner Channel   
Lower Bollinger Band Channel > Lower Keltner Channel

The rules I am using are listed below. I have backtested this method with good success for the past few months. Also, a 50 pip SL appears to stop out too many good trades on my 6 pip spread IBFX account, so I have increased it to 65. I can post some additional charts for entries (exits are the same as tkimble's) if it seems helpful.  
  
enter long trades  
1) if OsMA is new color in up direction at closed bar and when Bollinger Squeeze w/ CCI is not gray and is above zero or crossing above zero  
entry exception: if Bollinger Squeeze w/ CCI is gray but is near 200 line.  
  
exit long trades  
1) if OsMA has changed color on closed bar or reached 65 pip SL  
  
enter short trades  
1) if OsMA is new color in down direction at closed bar and Bollinger Squeeze w/ CCI is not gray and is below zero or crossing below zero  
entry exception: if Bollinger Squeeze w/ CCI is gray but is near 200 line.  
  
exit short trades  
1) if OsMA has changed color on closed bar or reached 65 pip SL

A question: 

  1. When you give that Long/Short exception for CCI, how near should it be? I'm assuming that you trade the exception if the CCI is between 190 and 210. Correct?
  2. I also looked at your bollinger squeeze example, and noticed that your OSMA is 12-26-9. Is that supposed to be there?

When it crosses 190 and -190, yes. I don't put that kind of detail on the indicator though, just watching the swings mostly. All of these "signals" are at a closed bar, of course, as it could retrace very easily.  
  
I placed OsMA 12-26-9 for another set up that I'm testing out for smaller pip gains on cable.

This took a little while as I was trying to get all the parameters right.   
  
Ok, this EA looks at the variables of the Bollinger Squeeze indicator.   
  
YOU NEED TO HAVE THE BOLLINGER SQUEEZE INDICATOR IN THE INDICATOR FOLDER FOR THIS TO WORK  
  
  
The variables are pretty easy to understand, and are the same as my last pair of EAs, I have also included the original V-only ea with Crapola's modification.  
  
  
Attached is a chart showing my setup using this system. Green is buy, Red, is sell, Blue is don't trade, and gray is the CCI.

Ronald, the EA opened up a sell when it should have opened a buy. It did take into account the Bollinger Squeeze which should be cool to see.

Crapola, if I'm looking at that correctly, it opened on the last red bar.   
  
Now, if that is one of the EAs that are U primary or V primary, that would be expected as the other two red bars look equal.   
  
The date is also weird. I didn't release any EAs for TrendHugger before December 5...My first TrendHugger EAs came out Dec. 19.   
  
My data (NorthFinance) says:

Equal bars there make an inverted "U" , Bollinger Squeeze says sell...  
  
From what I can tell, it entered properly, it didn't stop and reverse like it should have.   
  
Which EA are you using?  
Also, are you using my version of Bollinger squeeze? I had to modify the original indicator in order for it to interface better with the EA.

I used a data feed from ODL Securities for backtesting. Clearly the data is different. Here are mine:  
  
dec 5th 01:00 -.259  
dec 5th 00:00 -.257  
dec 4th 23:00 -.256  
dec 4th 22:00 -.256  
  
The only thing I can think of is the modeling quality of the data. I should probably just run it through forward testing to see how it does.

I was using the crapola version. Also, I didn't realize that the indicator was different. I'll try that one and let you know how it goes. Thanks again for spending the time putting this together.

I personally don't believe in the "U" formation entries, and I'm just running a plain vanilla system. Just the way TKimble likes it. (The first OSMA-based system)

I guess to not confuse anyone is to attach the EA with the required indicators so not to mix with others. And if the indicator was modified, maybe attach a version or something, and reference in the EA.

MMk, here's a rundown of the EAs.  
  
Version 1:This version uses only the "V" formation  
  
(Post 291)

[http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&postcount=293](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=1769157&postcount=293)  
  
Version 2:This version looks for the Equal bar system. Either primarily a V formation, or primarily a U formation. (Based on the title).   
  
(Post 311)  
[http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&postcount=311](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=1772282&postcount=311)  
  
Version 3: This version uses the bollinger squeeze method to filter out any sideways movement.   
  
(Post 319)  
[http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&postcount=319](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=1777444&postcount=319)  
  
OSMA-BasedCrapolaU_Primary uses the U Primary method with the bolinger squeeze.  
  
OSMA-BasedCrapolaV_Primary uses the V Primary method with the bollinger squeeze.   
  
Bollinger Squeeze v7 is my version which is required for any of these EAs to work. Make sure that this is in the indicator folder.   
  
OSMA-BasedCrapola is the V only method like version 1.  
  
  
  
  
That should be a complete listing of all the versions I made.  
  
  
  
I use the OSMA-Based EA as it works best for me. Quite minimal and easy to hunt for bugs when debugging. Just now I closed on a 250 pip gain, so. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

Although just to clarify, I'm using version 1 on a live account.

Are you using the MACD or the OSMA version? Or does it even make any difference?

Yep! MACD and OSMA are exactly the same thing. The only real difference is the position relative to 0  
  
Since this trading system is looking for a particular shape, it doesn't matter which you use. Although I prefer OSMA primarily because it's easier to program with.

Hi Ronald,  
What sort of results have you had with the OSMA version 1 EA?  
  
What pairs are you trading live?  
  
Just started testing last night with two small losses in a row so would be comforting to see how you have gone over a longer period of time  
  
Thanks

I am trading with an $1000 account using the original EA I programmed.   
  
My results are pretty modest myself. The Ea was active since 12/25/2007 and has since gone from $1000 to 1220.36. A very modest return, but certainly much better than other things I'm doing.   
  
The profit factor thus far is 2.4 That means that for every dollar I lose, I make $2.40.   
  
This is running on a 1 HR tf of GBPJPY and it's working fine for me. It seems to miss a few signals, but I'm guessing that's a result of repainting.

Hello Ronald,  
I know it's only a short amount of time, but a 22% return in a little over a week, during the holidays, is hardly a modest return. But then what is one to expect from a former leader of the free world.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

I use the same EA too on my live acct..givin me superb results,but i put it on a 30min chart instead..i glanced through the charts manualy with the Osma on both 1hr and 30min and noticed though the 30min gave u more frequent trades and hence liable to give me more whpsaw than the 1hr but on the other side it gave better entry points than the 1hr chart..so on the whole i think the 30min will still outperform the 1hr over a long period of time..just my opinion though....PLUS thanx for the EA ronald![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Not a problem at all and you're all very welcome.   
  
Just a reminder: I am not liable for any damages you may incur be it monetary, physical, emotional or otherwise.   
  
USE THESE EAs AT YOUR OWN RISK  
  
I am still demoing another setup where I put the EA on a 15 min chart and set up the OSMA as if it were a 1 hr chart. That way, the EA checks the 1 hr OSMA every 15 mins.   
  
That account made only $110, but if you're right about the holidays, then I see greener pastures.

Thanks Ronald. One thing.... if your exits are on opposite signal only, I found that there are several times (i.e. on a 400 pip profit) that signal will reach after quite a large drop which is why, I believe, TK recommended a 150 pip TS. Have you tried that with the EA?

I haven't run my Ea with a ts. If you feel it's necessary, then by all means. Go ahead. Frankly, I'll settle for any amount of consistent pips. It beats 0 or even negative.

I noticed that as well. I'm glad to know it's a quirk of the system and not in how I set it up. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Try this :-  
  
Copy and Paste the indicators into the "experts/indicators" folder where you installed MT4.  
For example, if you downloaded the installer from Strategybuilderfx.com, you'll paste the indicators in the ff. folder:  
C:\Program Files\StrategyBuilderFX 4\experts\indicators  
Or if you downloaded it from metaquotes.net, you'll paste it here:  
C:\Program Files\MetaTrader 4\experts\indicators  
  
  
If MT4 is currently open, close it.  
  
Now, Re-Open MT4  
  
In the navigator window under experts click on the custom indicator Tab and choose the indicator you want from the list.  
  
Hope this helps,  
  
by the way there's a very helpful search facility at the top of the forex factory page which helps when you need to find things.  
  
Happy pipping,

RR, from my understanding, does this mean that you are simply playing the Stop and Reverse of the OsMA and a fixed 50pip stop?

What a beautifully simple system. I made a couple of hundred demo pips yesterday, so I shall see what today brings.  
  
The ea has opened several trades overnight, all currently in profit.  
  
Thanks tk for the strategy.  
  
Thanks Ronald Raygun for the ea.

Cable seems to be showing a trough on my chart today - I'm trading this system on daily charts. Will wait till end of day to confirm, but looks like this will be a signal.  
  
I am up 500 pips on my short usd/jpy trade that started on Jan 1st. Happy new year !!  
  
I am using a stop loss of 2xATR instead of the 50 pip SL that is on page 1. I am moving this to breakeven once the trade goes for 150 pips, then using a 100 pip trailing stop or reverse signal for exit. I probably need to start a journal to log these trades....

Just to give my 2 cents. ( Although I'm worth multi- millions) Got into a trade yesterday on the 1 hr. GBP/JPY using version 1 osma based EA. 50 pip stop loss. The trade made an exact profit of 50 pips. My first trade with the EA was successful. I'll now keep a log. I'm using it on North Finance. So far, good. Paris

I hate when people ask this because they never define what "Best" means.

Somebody asserted in an earlier thread that this strategy would be badly hit by whipsaw. I found out just how badly when I started to demo-trade last week.  
  
Thursday was great - made a shed-load of pips.  
  
Friday - whipsaw took them all back and some more.  
  
Monday and Tuesday - more modest loss.  
  
Come yesterday, Wednesday, I decided to try adding one of the filters posted here, so I added the Bollinger Squeaze.  
  
By following the simple rule of only entering a trade on an OsMA bar colour change that was matched by the same colour in the corresponding Bollinger bar I avoided most of the bad trades - 1h tf and checking on progress every hour.  
  
The effect was dramatic. For a couple of hours in the afternoon, I had 5 trades open, all heading in the right direction. At one point, I could have closed out having tripled the account balance - had this been live I would have done this, for sure.  
  
Being a demo, I set a 50 pip trailing stop and sat back to watch. Gradually, the orders peaked and retraced to the sl. Four of the orders closed leaving the account balance double what it had been at the start of the day  
.  
There was one trade left open - a uc buy. This is still open as I write this on Thursday morning, and cannot make less than +59 whatever happens now. It was fascinating to watch uc scream upwards yesterday; in the space of about an hour it shot up over 100 pips, slicing through resistance lines as though they had no psychological effect on traders whatever.  
  
uc hit its highest of 1.1023 and has stayed between this and about 1.1979 since, so it will be interesting to see which way it will go when it finally breaks the shackles. Given that uc is at, or very close to, its lowest ever (a glance at a monthly chart shows this) I am hoping it will breakout upwards. We shall see.  
  
It is early days. Who knows? Perhaps this week I will be writing, "Forget filtering the trades, it is a rubbish idea"? For now, applying a filter seems to help avoid whipsaw.

Bollinger squeeze definitely helps, I can't say however that it is a cure-all.

I will second that. I forgot to mention that the vast number of pips I made yesterday would have been vaster were it not for a couple of sl-hitters.  
  
That uc order finally stopped out at +123. I also have a -50 ec long and a +4 uj long. The uj had a ts of 50, so the price hit +54 before retracing and would now be threatening the 50 sl. All in all, up another 76 today. I have a audusd long outstanding that is heading the wrong way rapidly, so that could make a dent in today's proceedings. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1):

Just curious if anyone has had similar results on this EA. I'm currently using the first OsMA based EA and began trading a $5,000 demo using 3 mini-lots per trade on G/J, U/J, G/C, and G/U. As of today the EA has made 23 trades of which 3 were profitable and the rest losers. My account currently is at $3129. It appears that a lot of trades had a good profit at some point but ended up giving it all back before the color change.  
  
I should note that I'm running the EA using its default values except for the lot size which I changed to .3. I read the post above about the bollinger squeeze and am curious to see how that goes. I am also thinking about reviewing each trade after the week is over to find an average profit that each trade hit and maybe begin using a take profit based on that average. Just an idea.

I'm also trading the first EA version with no take profit, stop and reverse, 50 pip stop loss on the GBP/JPY one hour tf. Well, like all other systems this one gets killed in the ranging market which is what it's been doing the last couple of days. 5 straight losing trades in a row now. You need those 300-400 pip trades to make a profit in the end with this system. How are you doing Ronald Raygun with your trades now? Are you still making $2.40 for every dollar you lose? Paris

I actually lost a little money now, so my profit factor is much closer to 1. (Somewhere around 1.3:1 so for every dollar I lose, I make $1.30)  
  
  
I noticed that the trade goes up into massive 100-200pip profit, then turns around completely and hits the stoploss, so I'm putting in a TP of 100. We'll see what happens.

Entered a buy on cable yesterday at 1.9714, which today has reversed itself. Lost 180 pips so far, which offsets the Yen trade I still have going which is up around 500 pips. So, following the rules, I'll need to exit this trade at the end of today if the daily OsMA bar is red. My emergency stop is at 2XATR for the pair.   
  
The MOST important part of accepting this system, is to test what kind of drawdowns it produces. If these are manageable and R/R is positive, then it is a good system. Right now I am trying to determine RR over the span of many trades. In this timeframe that will take a while. 

Disregard all prognostications.

Thankyou very much for the EA. I'm enjoying testing it. I think we have to take our lumps when the market is choppy and ranging but we'll make out great when it trends even for a little while. No problem. Tkimble says it makes money in the long run and that's good enough for me. Yeah i did get 5 losses in a row from the chop and my first trade was a winner. Back testing the method looks decent as you do get the 300 and 400 pip or more moves now and again. I appreciate all your EAs on this forum. I think this one will be a winner in the long run. Daily 100 v.1.2 I think has some bugs at this time. So I'll practice that method manually for the time being. Thanks again Ron, you're great! Paris

O.k. I'm going to set it at 120 pips take profit and 75 pip stop loss and 75 pip trailing stop and see how that works out. Paris

Two things....if you are trading this on a larger timeframe, say daily, then 100-200 pips isnt massive. Its normal for a day's work for many pairs.  
  
Secondly, If you want this to be a trend following system, then you wouldn't really want to set a TP at all. You get out when either the trend reverses itself (using OsMA or another indicator) or when it hits your trailing SL.  
  
A TP goes against the rule of letting profitable trades run....yes?

Good point pigeon. I moved the settings again as I haven't had a trade since I started making changes as it's been in a long downtrend since stopping me out of 50 pips. I'm changiing it to no take profit, 50 pip stop loss and a TS of 120. I'm trading on the hourly chart, same a tkimble. Paris

I may have read this wrong in an earlier post but I thought you couldn't set both a stop loss and a trailing stop at the same time on Ron's EA - I thought it was an either/or type situation.

I opened 3 trades using this system last friday (25th). Even with all the Fed hoopla, I'm up over 100 pips each on two of the pairs. The third, GBP/CHF, has been ranging but is looking to move up soon.   
  
I am very interested this week to see how trades opened here fare during major news events, so this is a good week to test this. My hope is that news is largely ignored against the momentum of the trend. I trade this on daily charts, so any news event tends to get absorbed anyway.  
  
So far, as TK has said, this is my most profitable system to date. Ok, well its not MY system but you get the drift. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1) TK's previous weekly scalping system was good, except that it suffered during ranging weeks. This system usually has you either in an existing trade or sitting out the pair while markets are ranging, so the range behavior should occur above or below your initial entry, allowing you to ride it out until the trend resumes.   
  
You do have to watch swap rates with the daily charts, and I've noticed some bias towards pairs with positive swap.

Hi Pidgeon, How did those trades work out? im thinking the longer time frames are better. At the mo im using the 4hr..... had a bit of a go on the daily, still really not sure.  
  
Thanks

Ronald, Thanks for all your contributions. Which of the EAs is oSMA based, is it 291, 293 or 311. i want to know since this is the one you are using. thanks  
Sola  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
MMk, here's a rundown of the EAs.  
  
Version 1:This version uses only the "V" formation  
  
(Post 291)  
[http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&postcount=291](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=1767622&postcount=291)  
(Post 293)  
[http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&postcount=293](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=1769157&postcount=293)  
  
Version 2:This version looks for the Equal bar system. Either primarily a V formation, or primarily a U formation. (Based on the title).   
  
(Post 311)  
[http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&postcount=311](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=1772282&postcount=311)  
  
Version 3: This version uses the bollinger squeeze method to filter out any sideways movement.   
  
(Post 319)  
[http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&postcount=319](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=1777444&postcount=319)  
  
OSMA-BasedCrapolaU_Primary uses the U Primary method with the bolinger squeeze.  
  
OSMA-BasedCrapolaV_Primary uses the V Primary method with the bollinger squeeze.   
  
Bollinger Squeeze v7 is my version which is required for any of these EAs to work. Make sure that this is in the indicator folder.   
  
OSMA-BasedCrapola is the V only method like version 1.  
  
  
  
  
That should be a complete listing of all the versions I made.  
  
  
  
I use the OSMA-Based EA as it works best for me. Quite minimal and easy to hunt for bugs when debugging. Just now I closed on a 250 pip gain, so. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

All of the EAs are OSMA-based, and the ones my server is running is on post 293.  
  
However, keep in mind that OSMA and MACD are exactly the same with the exception of a shift relative to 0.

Hi Bob -   
  
I use the daily charts because trends seem easier to follow, and most pro traders use the daily charts. However there are not as many trades for this system as lower timeframes. TK uses hourly charts for this system, as he wants to stay busy and apparently doesn't have a regular job ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f633.png?v=15.1) like the rest of us.  
  
I am using 2xATR as a stop loss on all trades. Since we have been in a ranging pattern the last week or so on many pairs, I've been stopped out on 1 of the trades (Cable), and its come within a few pips of my stop twice on GBP/CHF. On my AUD/JPY trade, I closed it within a couple days of opening it, because I realized the volume was very low on this pair, and I felt a little overexposed on a pair i wasn't familiar with.  
  
I believe I will tighten my stops, so as to be stopped out sooner during ranging weeks. Better to stay out than to stay in a trade going nowhere. The GBP/CHF trade is still on from Jan 25th, but the price really never moved either way from the 30th to now.   
  
TK also uses his weekly scalp system, and it works well when the market is ranging as long is there is directional movement from M-F. This is a good system to work with while waiting for trends to resume. I believe trend following is still the best way to catch major market movements, but at the current time, most pairs are consolidating. Take a look at the daily chart of EUR/USD, we are stuck at 1.47, bouncing up and down and returning to it. Yen is stuck at 106.70 for the last two weeks. Etc. 

Disregard all prognostications.

Hello  
  
Thanks Pidgeon for getting back to me.  
  
Im having a problem with the EA, it opens 2 orders each time it gets a signal, both orders are in the same (and correct) direction ..... is it me? or is there somthing wrong with the file? Maybe Ronald Raygun knows something, i dont know much about Ea's so any help would be tops ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

Try running my EA on a separate terminal, or at least isolate it. If it's still opening two trades, somethings wrong and I have to dig through the code and figure it out.

I wasn't running tkimble EAs, sorry. I will say though that this system used to be profitable. The market's volatility has increased since the original system was released, so this system needs to be adjusted (change the 40, 50, 9 parameters, etc.)

TK - Yours systems are great for both their simplicity and profits (only hampered by my emotional and psychological weaknesses). I think this one is my favourite.  
  
Just wanted to ask... do you (or others using this system on the 1hr TF) treat news the same in this system as you do the others i.e. ignore news totally?

Change the lot size to 0.1 lots during news =D  
  
All I'm doing is changing my risk profile. More money is being allocated to the news-type trading and less money to the trending/ranging type trading.

Hi Guys  
  
Having read and re-read this thread just wondered where the âveteransâ of this thread are at  
  
(Daemien, Petersurrey, Scrat, Yezbick, Skyline, Aktur, Bullrock, toti1972, Piprage, Ryanmel, Driftwood, Hoss, Forexdude, Hondakoron, Grajo, JeremyA, MillerHighLife, Ronald Raygun, U2DaMax, BHoliday, Coolshades etc  
  
Has the system been successful over the 18 months?

The system makes money, no doubt, but as with the vast majority of systems for free on FF, you need to understand where the system thrives, and to make sure that the system is in it's element. All of tKimble's systems require a highly defind trend to make money. So, avoid any pairs or other situations where it's ranging.  
  
  
This one is similar to the OzFx system, but aims for longer (3-week) trends.

Hi RR  
  
And the determining the change from ranging to a trending market is the million dollar question that I have never seen a satisfcatory answer to

Visually determining trending vs ranging is easy.   
  
The hard part is implementing that into a system ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f64c.png?v=15.1)

It's easy enough to determine the chage from ranging to trending. Just look at any standard rainbow

Yet more bedtime/weekend study.  
  
But every system I have have seen, and there are some good ones about, works either in 'the range' or during trending. But it's the change that stings each system.  
  
Are you saying that the rainbow will 'give you the nod' as to which sytem to use ranging/trending?

It's not a perfect solution, but it's the best one I have.

So in the above I would buy because the bar is greater than the one before it, right?

No, you would go back to page 1 and read the first 5 pages of this thread. and also, use the OsMA color indicator, not the default one. Its on post #29.  
  
Currently, I use this indicator with a couple other ones, it tends to lead trends a little. 

Disregard all prognostications.

Hi, As simple as this strategy is I don't really understand it. Can you explain: The current price bar MACD is greater than the previous price bar MACD value. Does this refer to the histogram? Where would you place your TP.

not sure if you're still looking, but i'm looking to use it. I added in a 200SMA on the 1D so if it its above the 200SMA on Day I looking for buys on 1h and below 200SMA on day i look for sells only. Then I look at VWAP for entery, wait for it to be above the 50 period vwap on sell and below on but and then look at no lag MACD indicator to enter... seems pretty solid so far. looking at 20 to 30 PIP stop and 3:1 or 5:1 reward to risk. still looking. would love to look at this more with others if anyone is interested.
