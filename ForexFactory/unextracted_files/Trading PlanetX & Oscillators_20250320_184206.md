**Important Update**  
The thread has evolved faster than I expected. Thanks to [Parisboy](https://www.forexfactory.com/parisboy) and [R4M](https://www.forexfactory.com/robots4me), we now have a great tool (Focal Point Indicator) to complement PlanetX. Focal Point is still a work in progress and it is ready for use. Please refer to Post [49](https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/post/13937088#post13937088), [108](https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/post/13938029#post13938029), [125](https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/post/13938152#post13938152) and [134](https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/post/13938259#post13938259) to see how Focal Point indicator has evolved so far.  
  
**Trading PlanetX & Oscillators**  
This space is an offshoot of the [PlanetX Indicator](https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/1141853-planetx-indicator-can-this-indi-be-used) thread. The goal of this thread to explore trading with PlanetX and Oscillators that can provide additional edge. In my experience, I have tried many indicators and I can safely state that oscillators are great for trading. Beyond that, MM provides the real edge.

My chart looks like this today.

  1. I prefer to add on to trades as the trend progress. Find your own way and trade that way.
  2. This thread isn't about a specific strategy. It's about how you utilise MM and other approaches to extract value from the market.
  3. Avoid overthinking
  4. Trade what you see. PlanetX may spot the trend change or continuation, what you do with the signal is all that matters.
  5. Adjust your lot size appropriately after every loss or profit

Now let's get the ball rolling.

Here is one of my favorite combinations -- PlanetX plus DSS-Bressert. These complement one another well. Sometimes it seems to me that traders obsess over a losing trade or when an indicator's signals arene't perfect. Not only will they never be perfect, they don't even have to be. As long as the indi generates a correcting signal shortly after a head-fake then the damage is minimal and the new signal makes up for the small loss. If the indi doesn't generate a correcting signal and keeps you in a losing trade for a long period then that IS a problem.   
  
The simplest way to use an oscillating indi is to trade from transition to transition. And then you can refine your approach from there. For example, @BestTraderEv uses PlanetX's signals as "alerts" and incorporates a variety of other clues to define his Entries and Exits. There is no right or wrong way to trade. Trade what you see, and as you gain more experience you will see more.

Another indicator that complements PlanetX is DSS-RVI -- which is my own concoction. It applies Bressert's "double smoothing" algebra to the RVI (Relative Vigor Index) indicator.

This has been posted before in the other thread, but is worth repeating...  
  
Even though it is not apparent when staring at the main price chart, few people have remarked how price moves as a pendulum. There are only a few indicators that reveal this repeating pattern. I don't think many traders take advantage of this observation because it's not obvious when staring at bars in the main price chart.  
  
This pendulum pattern is due to repeating patterns of local highs / lows and is NOT the same as oscillations seen in MACD or RSI -- which are NOT based on local highs / lows.  
  
These pendulum patterns are most suitable for swing trading -- where swings occur every 3-8 bars, approximately.

All systems hover around some midline / equilibrium / fair market value, drifting above and below some equilibrium value. That includes systems like core body temperature, currency exchange, and many others.   
  
All systems have some kind of inherent feedback control that prevent them from imploding to zero or exploding to infinity. The feedback mechanisms that keep currency exchange rates hovering around some fair market value must be extremely complex and probably no one knows all of the possible feedback mechanisms.

Hello @parisboy -- so, so nice to hear from you. Maybe I'm beginning to see the light?  
  
So, I have a question for you. The pendulum pattern that I'm referring to and which currently interests me can be seen in the Stochastics indicator. Where does Stochastics fit in your wave / cycle theories. It's not the same, is it? The Stochastics pattern is more local, right?  
  
I've brought up the pendulum pattern before but no one gets it. My main point is that ALL systems, every single one of them, hover around some equilibrium. That chart of body core temperature was just another example -- it looks like Stochastics to me. And in order to hover around an equilibrium there must be feedback mechanisms that keep whatever metric we are monitoring -- be it price or temperature -- from imploding to zero or exploding to infinity. ALL systems have feedback mechanisms. It's the feedback mechanisms that keep the metric within a channel. Do you understand what I'm getting at?

Hello Robots4me  
  
a) it is NOT "my" wave / cycle theory". This "theory" you quote is the end result of the work of many researchers  
b) as for stochastics I do not use  
c) _My main point is that ALL systems, every single one of them, hover around some equilibrium._ I agree. But IMHO you make a (dangerous) confusion between a living process , let's say a biological one, and an electronical-financial one which shows us similar charts on a computer screen.  
  
It natural to generate analogies, human beings do that all the time, but analogies have their limits.  
Hence the right questions are ;  
  
what have both processes in common  
what differentiates both processes  
  
I have no problem with your Pendulum Pattern. I use it all the time  
with the Return to the Mean of varipus Centered Moving Averages  
or with the Gann concept of balancing Price and Time  
or with the Concept of Cycles Saving Account (a time variant of the Return to the Mean)  
  
Jim Hurst worked as an engeneer in the aerospace industry and he was hired by a group of investors to test the "theory"(ies) you quoted. Let'say that he thought he could improve our knowledge of the market by using the tools he used daily in his work. Let'say that Hurst saw some similarity between the charts he produced for his work and stocks charts.  
  
Peter Haurlan one of the main managers of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory had a similar thinking and used the technique of recalibration of the guidance of Intercontinental Missiles and apply this technique to the market.  
  
Hence I suspect both Hurst and Haurlan would agree with you _ALL systems have feedback mechanisms. It's the feedback mechanisms that keep the metric within a channel._  
  
How to identify this feedback mechanism ?

Everybody would agree that the blue Envelope envelopes very well most of GBPJPY fluctuations between March 4 th and March 18 th .  
  
But these fluctuations count for only 15 % of the Upmove

@parisboy -- excellent, excellent post -- thank you, sir!! It's a huge relief to hear from you we are on the same page. Taking a closer look at DSS-Bressert and your chart that showed the MA oscillating around the midline, then I could see these were the same oscillations. The only difference is that DSS-Bressert normalizes the deltas so they can be plotted in a subwindow, which makes them much easier to see.  
  
As to some of your other points...  
  
* I know it's not your theory and figured that because of your modesty you would point that out. But I felt like giving you credit because whenever waves / cycles comes up in a discussion I'll always point people to your thread. You are the resident expert... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
* The reason I brought in the biological example is two-fold: (1) My training is in research biochemistry, computer engineering and software development -- so, the visual similarities are striking to me; (2) I understand the biological example and its basis better than the financial one; (3) since we know the biological one employs feedback mechanisms, then it follows the financial one would, too; (4) and, finally, ALL systems employ some form of feedback -- they would have to otherwise they would implode to zero or explode to infinity.  
  
* thanks for the background information about Jim Hurst and Peter Haurian -- very interesting.  
  
* as for detecting the feedback mechanism(s) -- certain indicators do that.  
  
* as for what is responsible for the feedback in the FX system -- I'd say it is extrememly complex with many interdependent elements. Plus, no doublt, it includes some manipulation. In any event, much too complex for us to understand. However, and this is a big HOWEVER, we do not need to understand it in order to use it in our trading. By observing its pattern we can deduce much of its behavior, and that understanding provides an edge. We don't have to know all the elements that go into all the feedback mechanisms affecting a system -- instead, we can deduce clues from the way it affects the metric we are interested in (i.e. price in this case).  
  
I'm looking forward to discuss this further with you or anyone else. Again, thank you @parisboy.

Nice example. But let's make a distinction between oscillations and a major move. If one trades a super-trend following strategy then, sure, the major move is important. But when swing trading the major move is of secondary importance. These days I'm only interested in the "natural" oscillations revealed by indicators like DSS-Bressert, Schaffer Trend Cycle, Stochastics, and a few others. Of course, when you zoom-in then these oscillations can also be described in terms of trends. But there is a trading edge when you choose a time frame that reveals these "natural" oscillations.

In the above post I referred to a trading edge that becomes apparent when you choose a time frame that reveals these "natural" oscillations. And that was one of the motivations for launching the original PlanetX thread.

Robots4me. That was your chart , your time unit (1 hour) , your pair (GBPJPY), your time frame (4-18 march 2022.  
  
I can do the same kind of analysis whatever the time unit, the time frame and the forex pair, stock, index.  
  
There is no "natural" oscillation. Price action is a sum of oscillations which add up or substract their amplitude (that is the basis of Cycle Analysis)  
  
If the underlying trend is Flat / neutral you see the oscillations with your naked eyes.  
  
Otherwise more the (underlying)trend is steep - down or up - more it crushes on the chart the asperities (tops and lows) - see your GBBPJPY chart.  
  
Then the trend distort the pattern and dissimulate the Amplitude of the oscillation within a bigger one.  
  
To see these oscillation you do not need stochastics, you just need to substract from Price Action the Centered Moving Average of your choice.  
  
This difference will show you the tops and lows of the relevant cycle (oscillation) and its amplitude ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
  
Nothing complicated  
  
PS The Envelope on my chart is bauild on a Centered Moving Average 32 Time Unit - SMA offsetted back 16 Time Units.  
  
Substract it from Price Action annd observe what it gives you

Yes -- that's exactly it. The difference (delta) from the centered moving average (equilibrium / midline / fair market value).  
  
True -- one doesn't "need" Stochastics, DSS-Bressert or the others. However, because they plot **normalized** deltas then the osciallations are emphasized and they jump out at you. And not everyone has as keen eye sight as you, sir...  
  
With regards to time frame -- you are correct. I should have said Zoom magnification.

Major move and oscillations  
  
Observe on the second Chart that the Trend of the Centered Moving Average 1536 Time Units (1536 hours , more precisely 1536 Hourly bars - ) is almost Flat, slightly Up  
  
Within the Envelope 1536 (black) we are in a Cyclic Mode

Okay -- so is this for our edification or is there a trading edge hidden in there? If I gave you $100 USD to make a single trade -- where would you Enter / Exit and why?

Trading Edges  
  
Descending Valid Trendlines (red) linking 2 successive lower Tops of the same degree, nature. When broken on the upside you have a candidate Action Signal to enter Long  
  
Ascending Valid Trendlines (green) linking 2 successive higher Lows of the same degree, nature. When broken on the downside you have a candidate Action Signal to enter Short  
  
Cartouches Red Candidate to enter Short after touching of the Upper Limit of the 1536 Envelope (black)

It seems that you have 2 main Cycles at work within this Timeframe a 2 Months Cycle and a 4 Months Cycle

there are more tricks !  
  
I prefer to use your coding expertise (depending on your hourly tariff ! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1))  
  
PS This exerciise was a kind of post mortem. Very useful to understand what you have done (or not done) because on the long term you see endlessly the same patterns)

Guys, I don't know what's the discovery, here?  
Look at any market as a range. The entire range is from alltime low to alltime high.  
And then there will be tons of smaller markets inside this whole market.  
We, as traders, just need to find our range, our market, our pip-mine.  
Our range is the one that best fits our individual characters.  
And, of course, any buy-sell business can only work when we buy at wholesale prices and sell at retail prices.  
That's what those envelopes represent.

there was one false positive - very common  
  
  
then my idea to improve results is to generate "operative statistics"

Exactly!!! I know you were kind of joking but this also relates to my pendulum / feedback post. In ALL systems, the metric that is being measured diverges from an equilibrium only very minimually before feedback mechanisms pull it back toward equilibrium. Even though my chart of core body temperature appears to show large swings in temperature, when you look at the Y-axis you'll see the swings are < one degree. It all depends how you chart it. In MT4 the main price chart shows only the very tip of the iceberg -- < 1%.  
  
So, the chart you posted is next to impossible to trade. But, if you were to attach the DSS-Bressert indicator then you could trade.

Consider the image above. Could you trade the upper price chart? Probably not. But you could trade DSS-Bressert. Same time frame, same pair. It's all about how you graph the data.

You can trade anything under two conditions:  
1\. Your broker allows you to trade under your conditions,  
2\. The spread and/or commissions allow you to take a profit.

Right but you need to take into account ;  
  
the potential amplitude of the swing  
the fact that you do not short at the top and sell at the low (or conversely)  
your transaction costs to enter and exit or your spread

Yes, yes -- but you guys know what I meant. The discussion so far has only referred to charts -- so, I was referring to potential Entries based on chart signals. The bookkeeping you refer to falls under money management -- which is a different topic. Also, you expert traders forgot to mention available margin...  
  
When I look at your charts the first thing that pops into my head is not: "Oh, my, what's the spread"...

I was trying to reproduce your GJ chart but was having a heck of a time. At the top it says "1H", but it really is H4, right?  
  
Could you help me to reproduce your chart on GJ / H4 -- I would like to compare your markings with those from PlanetX, DSS-Bressert and other indicators to see how well they align. The goal would be to see if we could convert @parisboy's discretionary rules into algebraic, codable ones.

Do you trade with an EA?  
On USDCHF you went short although the blue line and chart went up. Why did you decide short?

If you need to take so many positins in one direction, I would say that you don't really know what you are doing...  
From your charts, it looks like you are just shooting blindly in series.  
  
Oh, and by the way, I thought that spamming threads with non related topics is against the ethics of this forum?  
And, how is your trading related to the topic of this thread? (You are the OP, after all...)

wow..... I decided not to respond to you in the language of your post. Remember to be nice the next time. I will keep my response nice.

  1. There is no one way of trading
  2. I can add on to trades as long as I want and confident the trend is still active
  3. I am trying to swing trade within a trend
  4. That PlanetX indicates buy doesn't mean you should buy/sell blindly and you know that BestTraderEV

I suggest you read the topic once more; slowly this time.  
  
Trading PlanetX and Oscillators  
Objectives

  1. Trade with PlanetX
  2. Use any additional edge (MM, S/R e.t.c.).....

You probably missed that part. Additional edge include how you place your trades, trade size, how you close the trades e.t.c   
  
Look I appreciate the work you have done with PlanetX so far. But I believe I was clear in the objective of the thread. I was equally clear about being polite with the language.  
  
Also, I don't have to risk all with one trade. I can better gauge my risk when I apply it slowly throughout the course of a trade direction. This works for me very well. If I lose, I adjust my lot size accordingly and go again with the aim of recovering the loss and getting back into profit.

Please don't feel offended by my style of writing. I can be harsh and direct, I am that way, and I think that this is actually the best way to go, because it tends to clear things up, though it does not help in befriending people. Yet, I don't really care about friends, because most of them are fake anyways, they are our friends bacause they think they can get something, like free drinks, or whatever.  
I do see that you have the OnChart signals and that you are going against them.  
And I see a lot of other nonsensical or illogical trades.  
  
BTW. Of course there is just one proper way of trading!  
PROFIT >> LOSS  
  
And, yes, I know that PlanetX indicators are not perfect, but they are damn good!

Yes we seem to be in a S/R zone but there is a huge possibility of breaking below this zone. If I notice some consolidation around this zone, I will look to close the current bunch of trades and start again. However, I will still maintain the short bias until there is a clear reversal around that area.

Future Line of Demarcation (FLD) 64 - price translated in the future by 32 hourly bars crosses Price Action swing in the midlle.  
  
Hence this confirms EURAUD 1 Hour is in the Low Zone.  
  

  
We have to wait for confirmation

PlanetX signals are good but has weakness.... when the pair is ranging, you get a lot of false swings and that can bring many losses if you are not careful. Besides, I have seen several of your trades that are perhaps instincts and experience and has nothing to do with PlanetX. So why are you accusing me of not following PlanetX 100% when you are guilty of the same?  
  
Everyone needs to find their own way of dealing with the false positives.

  1. Do you want to follow PlanetX blindly? if you do you will lose big time except you have other ways of handling the false positives
  2. If not, how do you hedge the risk?
  3. Do you have other ways of deciding which of PlanetX signals you want to ignore?

I wrote quite a lot about this on the other PlanetX thread, which I had joined first.   
Do you two, you and @robots4me, expect me to repost those here?

Bishopdotun. Thank you for you likes.  
  
I do not want to hijack your thread with my pet subjects. I have mine. Tell me if you classify some Hurst tools as "additional edge" or not.  
  
Any way your EURAUD 1 Hour chart was a by the book example. Thank you

When I was opening this trade, I am sure the signals were about short.  
I didn't take a screen shot, unfortunatelly.  
What happened here? I trailed my Stop Loss, and it got taken out, even though the price had been damn close to Take Profit. Normally I would have closed the trade when I had 200 pips profit, especially that the price had already pulled back on one M15 candle, then came back down, and bounced, but I wanted to be patient and see what would happen.  
In my experience, this always happens, I always do better when I close manually.

Let me explain why my reaction, when I see the type of trading as presented by @bishopdotun.  
Let's use the example of EURAUDH1:

Thus:  
It is always more risky to sell at worse prices which are not retail.  
Ideally, the trader should just Sell at the best prices, because he knows where the Stop Loss should be, and then let the trade run until there are good wholsale buy prices.  
And, vice-versa for Long trades.  
  
And, yes, there are no good reasons to Buy now, and there are no good prices to Sell now, either.  
Though, this is a zone to watch for a possible reversal.

@BestTraderEv -- I trade EAs with @bishopdotun. We trade 28 pairs and can have up to a couple hundred trades open at any one time. It's different than the way you trade. Focus on what he says in his post and ignore the background lines.  
  
The focus of this thread is discretionary trading with PlanetX. A few of us are free to extend this in other directions and include other indicators.  
  
FF has much to offer -- both in terms of trading and human psychology. This is the Internet. We are posting one and two sentence comments. The potential for misunderstandings is YUUUUGE!!! To survive and thrive here we have to learn (a) who are the good and bad guys, and (b) how to navigate potential misunderstandings and not let them derail us.  
  
@BestTraderEv -- you have much to offer and we can learn from you. And the same is true for you -- there are others here who have much to offer and from whom you can also learn. So, kick back and let's enjoy the ride together. What do you say?  
  
PS: And this comes from a fellow who knows. I hold the world's record for FF suspensions. I think I'm up to 10 now. I have this tendency to ruffle feathers...

Yes -- feel free to re-post here whatever you like. There was much to learn from your charts.

And that's for just this alias alone... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
As much as I like trading, I dislike sociopaths here even more. In real-life I'm a coward. The anonymity that FF affords allows me to occasionally sound-off how I really feel. And FF punishes me by sending me to time-out chair...

I just closed the last bunch of trades on EA and EN. My bias is still short hence I have started adding short trades again progressively.  
  
EN before I closed the trades.

Right -- sorry. So, can you help me reproduce the markings on your GJ/H1 chart so I can see how they align with PlanetX and other indicators?

Here is another moment when the oscillator was right, though the chart patterns and trends could lead to a different conclusion. IOW, when faced with the here-and-now, I ask myself which direction is it more likely for the price to go? Since the dominating trend was bearish, I could easily decide to go short with my stop loss just at the high of the ledge. And get the stop loss.

The vertical yellow line is the bullish alert you're looking at, right? So, the trade would have entered at the Open of the next candle, right? So, you are currently a few Pips in the green, right? Am I reading your chart correctly? If so, how long will you hold the trade?

I'm also liking your "EARLY" alerts that come from the Awesome indicator. Speaking of EARLY alerts, that might be a good post from the original thread to repeat here.

That is normal, and cowards are the ones who tend to survive and pass on their genes.

You see, I do not care about the number of pips, or points, because I always risk <= 2%, so my trade volume gets adjusted to the Stop Loss distance.

This is total BS!   
How many things do we believe just because someone said something, without proper scientific data to support the claim?

I'm just sayn' - it ain't always clear if one is actually breaching CoC...  
On another forum, a Mod blocked me from posting and invited me to a Mod Chat.  
I went over all the rules of that forum, and there were 5 rules.  
In the end the Mod agreed that the only rule I had breached was rule #5 which stated, in short, that the Mod is always right, and if you don't like it, you can FO.

Oh, and BTW, the clrChocolate OBJ_HLINE is an MN1 Pivot Point, the one going through the middle and ending at Bar[0], though not a standard one as defined by the standard Pivot Point. A Pivot Point is and axis around which something turns, or oscillates.

It's a "saying" that is not intended to be taken literally. However, as with most "sayings" there is an element of truth. This one came about to help ease the pain of losing someone who you felt died before their time.

Relax -- he was referring to DrDave. DrDave comes here with a reputation of trashing @emmanuel7788 and the TMS thread. He has followed me here with the intent of polluting this thread, as well. Recall our earlier exchange about sociopaths?

So, I answered him. Hope you read it! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

And you are soliciting, which is a major CLEAR breach of CoC and qualifies you as a commercial member, and you should not be posting, here.

Hi Bishopdotun,  
You are a very good and humble trader. I have a great deal of respect for you and have learned from you in your previous thread. I ask why you are putting up with all of this?. Serious culling is needed here.  
I trust you will do the right thing,  
All the best my friend,  
Cheers.

We add Centered Moving Average 128 (ocre) and 256 5brown)  
  
As for we suspect EURAUD 4 Hours will build a Double Bottom of some sort.  
My preference being that the second bottom would be higher than the firstI  
  
I suspect also a sideways situation (Hesitation Zone) between 1.53 and 1.46 as long as CMA 64 ha not build its Low and turned Up and CMA 128 decelerated to build its own Low

The oscillators are showing early reversal signals, yet the MACD overlay and PA on the chart does not suggest any reversal, yet.

You have to trust your tools  
  
Last Low is 1.48936  
  
Lower forecast was 1.4910  
  
But the estimation of the Focal point was visual and imperfect because all CMA's were almost parallel and parallel do not cross.  
  
Anyway the real forecast is we will not go lower and Price Action is ripe for a Change in Trend

I think EURAUD will go lower to about there-ish:

@parisboy -- I have a few questions. I'm really interested in getting this right, so please bear with me. As you know, I am still a rookie...  
  
The numbers may be off a bit, but have I correctly reproduced your chart and MA lines?

Here is my interpretation of your discretionary algorithm:  
  
1\. Look for the TWO most recent focal points -- in this case, around 1.5139.   
QUES: Where does 163264 come from?  
  
2\. Potential Targets:  
#1: FocalPoint minus the difference between HighestPoint and FocalPoint  
#2: Look left for an older FocalPoint  
#3: Look left again for an older Focal Point  
  
If this is kind of the idea, then this leads to another question. Your MAs are back-shifted half their periods, right? So this means you don't even care about the most recent bars, right? Once you have your FocalPoints you then compute your targets and no longer pay attention to any indicators. You wait for your targets to be hit. The only question that remains is at which target you exit?   
  
Am I hot, warm, cold, out in left field? If I'm warm then I think it would be fairly easy to create an indicator that simplifies things a bit or at least makes it easier to traverse 28 pairs and in a glance decide which ones are worth trading.

Where is "there-ish"? I'm not sure where to look on your chart.

163264 is just the label of a Focal Point where CMA 16, 32, and 64 have really crossed - using extension you can suspect or not if it could a fFocal Point of Higher degree 163264128 for example  
  
Jim Tillman worked at the time in Daily . For day trading n 1 mn I have "improved" precised the methodology. All Focal Points are not of the same nature.  
  
Focal Points are located in the middle of the relevant Sinewave.  
  
Roughly the Crossing of the CMA 256 and 128 gives you the general . If you refer to Daily the 256 Days Trend does not cross the 128 Days Trend every 10 days. Thhese events are less numerous but more important and you can link them by a straight line too  
  
I pay attention to ALL others Hurst incators FLD (EURAUD showed us today a beautiful example) and Envelopes too.  
  
I wait for the target to be hit - but I follow Price Action and recalibrate the chart as it develops.  
  
Anyway with time you will see endlessly the same patterns.  
  
It would be interesting to generate "operative statistics."  
  
How many Focal points of the same nature  
Alerts when a Focal Point is created (it means that Price Action has made a Low or a Top)

Dude -- this is most interesting. I've been traversing different pairs and now the FocalPoints really jump out and I can see how they provide an excellent clue. I tend to trade on the conservative side, so I would set TP at the first available target and then go searching for more setups. I don't mind leaving Pips on the table.  
  
This is really different from anything else I've ever traded. I'm always looking for signals in the hope of getting into a trade shortly after a transition occurs. But FocalPoints is completely different.  
  
You mention different types of FocalPoints -- that would be interesting to explore in future posts.  
  
And now I'll definitely look into Hurst's other indicators. Your FocalPoint post is one of those rare gems that keeps me coming back to FF, even when it means dealing with a few sociopaths. Thank you, @parisboy...

The size of the boxes reflect the "strength" of the crossing, right?   
  
Is it just the number of MAs that cross within a vicinity or do you also take into account the slope of MAs?

It is just to couunt the number of different Focal Points  
  
7 x 1632  
2 x 163264  
2 X 163264128

@parisboy, @BestTraderEv...  
  
I can see how PlanetX and FocalPoints can work together. FocalPoints are used to determine an Entry -- it's not actually a signal, but when you enter you can be confident of the direction. And the direction is confirmed by PlanetX.  
  
In @parisboy's example you compute the target Exits. Alternatively, I think PlanetX could also be used to visually determine when it is time to Exit.  
  
It is not necessary to milk the trend of every last Pip -- it's okay to leave some on the table. With this type of trading I can imagine it could have a high winrate if you Exit at the first sign the wind might be changing direction.

P. N. (Pete) Haurlan was the first to use exponential smoothing for tracking stock prices. Haurlan was an actual rocket scientist who worked for JPL in the early 1960s, and thus he had access to a computer. He did not call them “exponential moving averages (EMAs)”, or the mathematically fashionable “exponentially weighted moving averages (EWMAs)”. Instead he called them “Trend Values”, and referred to them by their smoothing constants. Thus, what today is commonly called a 19-day EMA, he called a “10% Trend”.   
  
Haurlan had employed EMAs in designing the tracking systems for rockets, which might for example need to intercept a moving object like a satellite, a planet, etc. If the path to the target was off, then some sort of input would need to be applied to**the steering mechanism** , but they did not want to overdo or underdo that input and either become unstable or fail to turn. Thus, the right sort of smoothing of data inputs was helpful. Haurlan called this “**Proportional Control”** , meaning that the steering mechanism would not try to adjust out all of the tracking error all at once.   
  
EMAs were easier to code into early analog circuitry than other types of filters because they only need two pieces of variable data: the current input value (e.g. price, position, angle, etc.), and the prior EMA value. The smoothing constant would be hard-wired into the circuitry, so the “memory” would only have to keep track of those two variables. A simple moving average, on the other hand, requires keeping track of all values within the lookback period. So a 50-SMA would mean keeping track of 50 data points, then averaging them. It ties up a lot more processing power

Instead he called them “Trend Values”, and referred to them by their smoothing constants. Thus, what today is commonly called a 19-day EMA, he called a “10% Trend”. Haurlan had employed EMAs in...

This is a work in-progress -- more to come, I hope. It is a continuation of @parisboy's post #102 on FocalPoints. This is new to me and I find it very interesting -- it's also extremely simple and lends itself well to discretionary swing trading. Perhaps it will dovetail into PlanetX -- we'll see. We'll never know unless we try, right?

The above images are EURAUD/H1 and GBPUSD/H1 charts that display some Focal Points. The new indicator -- R4M-FocalPoints -- which I am still working on, is nothing special. It saves you the time of manually creating 5 moving averages. I will be adding more with the intention of flushing-out the Focal Point algorithm.  
  
One thing to note at this point -- there are different "qualities" or "strengths" of Focal Points. I can identify the following properties of a Focal Point:  
1\. The number of SMAs lines that participate in the Focal Point  
2\. The proximity of the participating lines to the center of the Focal Point  
3\. The slope of the Focal Point  
  
My expectation is the "stronger" the Focal Point then the more accurate it will be.

Still a work in progress -- an update to the FocalPoints indicator. I've added dots along each SMA. A dot will appear when an SMA falls within the High and Low of a particular bar. Focal Points occur when SMA lines intersect. My algorithm will be using dot "density" to define a Focal Point. The higher the density of dots then the stronger the Focal Point.  
  
Just to be clear -- a Focal Point is NOT a trading signal. Rather it is a historical "meeting point" of up to 5 SMAs. Using these historical "meeting points" one can then make a very simple calculation. If you know how to add / subtract then you would qualify. The calculation is then used as a Target price. You can refer to @parisboy's post #102 for further details.  
  
For those familiar with @George's thread about TARGETS, TARGETS, TARGETS -- there is a common theme here in that Focal Points use historical data to predict a target price in the future.  
  
  
There's still more to come...

How about a little patience. When was the last time you learned something new? Or, perhaps you already know everything and aren't interested.  
  
New ideas don't automagically fall out of the sky onto your lap. Someone has to take a risk to see where they might lead. Timid souls are afraid to step out of the Garden of Eden for fear of what lies beyond the fence. There's a reason our brains have evolved two hemispheres -- the left for managing what we already know and the right for exploring. The optimal place where we are most fulfilled is somewhere inbetween. Nature (and often life) can be brutal. Survival (and learning) requires a willingness to check out what's on the other side of the fence from time-to-time.

Hi Wavegarrick,  
Thank you for your nice words and for bringing this issue up. I perfectly understand your concern. When I composed the first post, the intention was to keep the thread focused on only PlanetX. But I also know that PlanetX has an inherent weakness. I therefore left room for oscillators which could help overcome that weakness. Of course MM and other potential edges are welcome. I also gave room for respected contributors to introduce interesting stuff. Parisboy, R4m, BestTraderEv, Swingman etc are people I value their work and later decided to allow those input.  
  
The current discussion started from CMA and has now evolved into focal points. They are trying to arrive at an algorithm for computing safe target price/zones for PlanetX entries. That's what I assume is the direction of the conversation between Parisboy, R4m and BestTraderEV. Sometimes allowing flexibility in this type of engagement can lead to interesting discoveries. Some of the fantastic tools I use privately with R4m today are products of exploration.  
  
I will keep my eye on the conversation so it stays in the right direction. Thank you once again.  
Ciao.

Next version -- but still a work in progress. The yellow squares are Focal Points that are algorithmically detected. I've also added a setting "FocalPoint strength" who's values can range from [2,5]. This controls the "strength" of the detected Focal Points. The values [2,5] represent the number of SMA lines that intersect at a particular bar.

Some points on PlanetX  
  
\- It's very good with trending pairs  
\- Great under trending conditions or extended range (range with a wide amplitude)  
  
EURAUD is my favourite for now.

Another example of a Focal Point -- this one is perfect. Pairing this bearish Focal Point with its more recent bullish partner and performing the simple calculation results in a very accurate target price. Actually, you can compute multiple target prices, but my nature would be to bank the Pips sooner and not try milking it further. My time and resources are better spent looking for the next setup.

Check this out...  
  
@BestTraderEv is a staunch advocate of Support / Resistance. I don't have a good S/R indicator but I do have a decent Supply / Demand one. I realize that technically they are different but I've forgotten how and right now I'm too lazy to look it up. In any event, they serve a similar purpose.  
  
In the image below you can see that the supply / demand zones would be consistent with @parisboy's Focal Point algorithm. I don't think the supply / demand zones are necessary to trade Focal Points -- but I did think it was interesting the two were consistent with one another.

@bishopdotun pointed out to me that if the Focal Point strength is reduced to '2' then the Focal Point markings might be used to alert you to "swing zones". Below is an image to show what he means.   
  
I've also updated the indicator and added a setting to, optionally, hide the SMA lines.

Nice -- that's the SMA(128) line...  
  
It's almost like that is really all we need for the Focal Point algorithm. Is that the point?

Robots4me for the algorithm I think so  
  
but for the use for trading there are refinements  
  
I will develop that point if bishopdotun and you are ok  
and also you need to understand what means these CMA"s they are not just excellent trend lines or superb sinewaves  
  
PS  
  
I need to go I will be back in one hour  
  
Thank you for your good and quick work (as always)

There is a significant difference, though. In rocket science we know where the target actually is, and we can calculate the path to it.  
We do not know those in trading charts, because we do not know where the target will be in the future.

You're kinda right and kinda wrong. Because of the way MT4 charts only show the tip of the iceberg you may think that price fluctuates a lot and we have little idea where it will go. Though we may not know what the absolute price will be in 3 hours, we do know that it hovers around an equilbrium / fair market value. And that's where the edge lies. Also, we do not need to know the absolute price in the future -- we just need to know which DIRECTION it is headed. There's a big difference.  
  
Set the bias aside and take a closer look at @parisboy's Focal Point strategy -- it works. If you are lucky a light bulb will go on. Just be careful not to slap your forehead too hard... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Yes -- please develop the trading points. I'm not big on the theory part, but if you can distill it into codable rules then I am up for that.

It has nothing to do with a theory or theories a guy (Hurst) or guys has conceived in his head.  
  
It is a mathematical question :  
  
how are built Moving Averages (then CMA's)  
what are the effects of Moving Averages on datas  
what it means for us when we use Moving Averages in our trading  
  
in our example we will use BTCUSD 1 mn because BTCUSD istrable right now on Saturday and 1 mn becaus we can observe the changes very quickly

Working with CMA 16 Time Units (BLUE) and CMA 32 Time Units (red)  
  
CMA 32 (blue) is called **the Full Span Average**  
  
CMA 16 (red) is called **the Half span Average**  
  
**Note that CMA 32 is the Half Span Average of CMA 64**  
  
**Question is : what occurs to Price Action when Half Span Average and Full Span Average Crosses ?**

I'm not saying that you're wrong.  
I'm just saying what I had already said previously in the other thread.  
There is only one thing that counts in any business if the business is to thrive and not go bankrupt:  
The business needs to make money in order to cover all of its expenses (including stop losses), and make profit.  
In order to do that, the business must make good deals, and endeavor to only make good deals.  
The business must cut the losses, and if necessary get rid of the losing stock at any price in order to invest in new stock.  
When there is stock that can't be sold at any price, we must get rid of this stock ASAP.  
  
Try to translate that to trading the charts.

Just a side note.  
If I'm not mistaken, then these ideas you are working on are not new. They have been worked on as early as 1920's - 1930's.

By the way, I'll let you in on a secret. The shaded differences between SMA(16) and SMA(32) have a lot in common with PlanetX. If anyone doesn't believe then they should take a closer look.

I'm following, but your use of the word 'span' kind of throws me. In my world -- the coding world -- the word 'period' is used. The period is the length (in bars) of the sliding window that is used when computing a moving average.

you are right. Oeriod is used also by Cycle Analysts. But Hurst in his Book used Span. Ok for using Period

You're missing the point. You trade in a square. This new concept is a circle. You're trying to fit the circle into your square. It's never going to fit. The square is your bias. You will need to set it aside in order to grasp the new concept. That doesn't mean you have to embrace the new concept.  
  
Also, @parisboy has made it clear it's not his theory. It was initially developed over 50 years ago by mathematicians / engineers working to solve a problem on a different type of system -- jet propulsion. But since all SYSTEMS share common requirements, then these concepts were also applied to financial markets.  
  
@BestTraderEv -- look closely at the shaded differences between SMA(16) and SMA(32) -- do you see any similarities with PlanetX? You also have the source code.

In other words, when SMA(16), SMA(32) and SMA(64) cross then we have a Focal Point, right? That's your label "163264", right?

in MT4 are SMA's offsetted back of half of their period ?

I incorporated the half-period back-shifting in my indicator. You can do something similar with MT4's built-in moving average -- there is an option to add a shift. In this case the shift value would be a negative number.

I see the newly formed Focal Point, but I don't know what you mean by "6 bars back". Could you place an arrow where these 6 bars are located.

@parisboy -- this is so cool.   
  
Look it -- this parallels how PlanetX works, though Focal Points is deeper and richer. PlanetX came about from empirical observation, whereas Focal Points has a theoretical basis. I would say that PlanetX is Focal Points "lite".  
  
It's no surprise they share a similar ancestry -- they are both MA-based. It's like the difference between chocolate chip ice cream and mint chocolate ice cream. Both are ice cream and both have chocolate chips...

**Some notes on PlanetX and Focal Point Indicator**  
  
Thanks to @Parisboy and @R4m, the conversation regarding CMAs have progressed nicely into a focal point indicator which turns out to be very good at picking out swing zones. Good job guys.  
  
Next on the agenda is how to deploy Focal Point effectively in combination with PlanetX. Below are my initial thoughts and suggestions. Please note that everyone must find what works best.

  1. Focal Point picked the swings nicely almost all the time. Could be used as a trend change detector. The swings are coded Blue(long) and Pink (short).
  2. If Focal Point is used to set direction, PlanetX can be used as entries (in the direction of the swing) and exits (when opposite the direction of swing)
  3. Alternatively, Focal Points can be used alone as entries and exits.

    1. For example: look at the EURAUD chart below. for every focal point, place a trade with the ATR of the timeframe as profit target. close the trade at profit target or stop loss or opposite signal. H1 ATR for EA is 30pips. 80-90% of those signals would have been profit trades.

EURAUD - H1

Well, I don't know what to do with those focal points.  
They are useless, because I need a signal where I'm pointing.  
Then I know where to put my Stop Loss. Next I need to estimate the most likely Take Profit, and I can do that.  
When I have my SL & TP prices, then all I need is my Optimal Entry Price, which is at 0.618 pullback, so tahat I get 1 SL to 1.618 TP.  
So, if my risk is 2% (SL), my TP is at 3.236%.  
Thus, I have earned 2% for my future SL and 1.236% extra.  
  
Now, all I need to do is NOT take worse deals than that.

not exactly. there is similarities., visual similarities.  
  
But there is no (official) "theoretical explanation of why Andrews Fork work.  
  
Moreover Andrews locates the Midline of the Fork in the Middle of the Swing. Focal Points are generated differently through the crossing of CMA's and can be located also on the Middle of the Swing ..... or not.  
  
I will come back later on Andrews because it is important and can be useful for trading.if Bishopdootun and Robots4me do not consider it clutters tge thread

When I have my SL & TP prices, then all I need is my Optimal Entry Price, which is at 0.618 pullback, so tahat I get 1 SL to 1.618 TP. So, if my risk is 2% (SL), my TP is at 3.236%. Thus, I have earned 2% for my future SL and 1.236% extra. Now, all I need to do is NOT take worse deals than that. {image}

@BestTraderEv -- you haven't been reading. Focal Points are not signals. I've emphasized this a couple of time in recent posts.  
  
Focal Points are HISTORICAL meeting points of 3 friends -- Mr. SMA(16), Mr. SMA(32) and Mr. SMA 64). They do not meet to trade. However, after their two most recent meetings they go home and perform a very simple calculation that guesstimates where price is headed. If you like their guesstimate then you can Enter a trade at that point. At the point at which you Enter a trade there are NO markings or signals -- the Focal Points occurred in the past. However, what you do have in your hands is a good idea where price is headed. It's different. Neither of us have traded before this way before. It also has a theoretical basis. And what's even more interesting is that the use of SMA(16) and SMA(32) is very similar to the basis of PlanetX.  
  
I think you may need to revisit the post where I distilled @parisboy's initial charts into a set of codeable rules. That's what I had to do in order to create the R4M-FocalPoints indicator.

This is different from what you and I are familiar with. Turns out that occasionally something new under the sun passes our way. It doesn't mean that it is better and it doesn't mean you have to embrace it. But in order to stop battling with it you'll need to set aside those bias blinders -- just for an hour or so. Ironically, as we've learned, Focal Points aren't really new. They are almost as old as me.

Chartists have classified Patterns visually and determined "rules" of thumbs.  
  
Cycles Analysts have explained why and how these patterns formed (see Double Tops and Double Bottoms) explained by Cycles and CMA's  
  
You have the same kind of relationship between Andrews and Tillman. Focal Points and Andrews Forks

In the settings, change focal point strength to 2.  
  
The strength refers to the number of CMAs touching the candle and the average direction of the swing at that point.

Great, I just don't understand how that "explains" the Double Top?  
I mean, the data you used to calculate those MA's come from the chart, not from independent sources, so this is not explanation, this is confirmation bias.  
It is post hoc, thus it explains nothing, it just gives your brain a confirmation as a feedback.  
The Double Top pattern is a typical range where Distribution is taking place, of course, a potential Distribution, because we can never know 100%.  
Yet, it is a good Sell opportunity, because we know where StopLoss must be, and if the price breaks down, we can move our SL to BE+ in order to minimize potential Losses.

Thanks, but that does not answer anything.  
I have been through almost any trading idea on this market. Some of them I just touched on, others I dug deep into. Everything is the same at the core, it all comes from the data already available on the charts. And, the way our brains work, is they seek patterns, we are pattern-seeking biological machines. And the brain seeks explanations for what it observes, but that is usually post hoc justification, and confirmation bias. That's why we have the scientific method, in order to minimize confirmation bias. Do you think you can jusitfy your observations and calculations by the scientific method? You know, by seeing if your thesis can not be falsified?

The R4M-FocalPoint indicator is half-baked and still a work in progress. There is more to be done to flush out the details to make this easier to trade.

You'll need to start with a clean chart. The other lines and markers are getting in the way of seeing how Focal Points work.

@parisboy -- a question about how to trade the Double Top (and Double Bottom). Suppose I see a Double Top -- is that my clue to enter a SELL trade? And, if so, is there a calculation or visual that predicts a target price? Or do I ride it down and "exit at my leisure"?

Look, if you can calculate where home is, you can, actaually code everything into the indicator (and EA, actually). You need 3 horizontal lines spread out in such a way, that the MathAbs(SLPrice-EntryPrice) < MathAbs(EntryPrice-TPPrice), and you can input a proportial parameter for the trader to decide on, like 1.618 by default, so that the EntryPrice will be where tha RR is 1 SL to 1.618 TP.

If I can, I would say no. We need more than that.  
If the overall trend is Bullish, then I can count on this, likely, not more.

@BestTraderEv -- I just saw on the TMS thread that DrDave and tommydoginti got you suspended. Welcome to the club. The fact that you were reinstated so quickly means the FF admin saw theirs was a bogus complaint and they had abused their privileges. It must really piss them off that after getting @ohitsyou banned then this thread was created and is taking-off like nothing we expected. Whereas we're excited about brain-storming a new trading strategy (thanks to the man from France), they spend their time mired in posting insults. Maybe there really is such a thing as Karma... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

A possibility.  
  
But real experts in Double Tops know surely better entries.

Hey Blue -- nah, I remember it. It's just that after FF binned the original thread then there was no reason to continue with @ohtitsyou. I was looking for a fresh start, which twee had offered awhile back. But, you know me, when coding tasks slow down then I go looking to rattle chains.

Perhaps. ..  
  
I was curious to learn whether the Focal Point theory included guidance on how to trade Double Tops / Bottoms. If there is something new to learn then I'm hungry to learn it. And if there is nothing new to learn then, fine, I'll come up with an empirical approach.

Okay. But just as Focal Points includes a calculation to guesstimate a target price, I was wondering if such a calculation (or similar) gets applied to Double Tops, as well.

That only if the overall trend is Bearish, but sure, if we have no other clues, we just accept the Stop Loss.

That's not the same situation. That is about 2 hours later. Or more. You were showing the situation about 17:30. And my comment was about that one.

@parisboy -- another question: What benefit do the SMA(128) and SMA(256) privide? If a valid FocalPoint only requires 16,32,64 then why clutter the chart with additional lines? Is it because when 128,256 do participate in a FocalPoint then, visually, it looks very impressive?

Nice. Beautiful example.  
  
A request -- since I don't trade BTC could you restrict your charts to the forex 28 pairs. That makes it easier to follow along. Also, I only test using the 28 pairs and if a bug were to occur while executing on a BTC chart then I won't catch it and, also, may not be inclined to fix it.

they show us the Long Term Trend (relatively to the Time Unit and the Time frame on the scree)  
  
They very often allows us to draw the large Channel / Sinewave in which the lesser Sinewaves Oscillate

Thanks...  
  
@parisboy -- for the short-term, I'm going to simplify the R4M-FocalPoint indicator a bit for the purposes of swing trading. These are all great, great tips and I will incorporate them, in time. But I need to take smaller bites and get things off the ground so I (and, perhaps others) can begin trading with it. And as we become more familiar with this strategy and gain confidence, I'll continue to enhance it with the finer details you've been providing.

And you're not battling it? Kinda seems like you're more intent on proving FocalPoints wrong than interested in adding another tool to your toolbox. I'll stop trying to coax you along -- you are a battle-hardened trader and know what you're doing...

I don't think the Double Tops were fake -- you don't yet understand how the algorithm works. The Double Tops were correct for awhile and then the trend changed. Double Tops don't mean a bearish trend will run forever. If you had entered a short where @parisboy had indicated you'd have a nice win. But it is up to you when to Exit and bank those green Pips. If you ride the train too long then the trend will eventually turn against you.

Clarity. I show you why I would not go short at the given situation, or how I would trade it, because the overall trend is Bullish, and you come back in a totally different moment and say that the trend was not Bullish. Yet, your averages and focal points seem to show the same/similar in both situations. So, please tell me if you took short trades on those two fake DT's, or did you add positions and just got lucky, and all that talk about those things you see is just your imagination?

I call them, or we can call them negated. In PA, a formation which has been negated is no longer that formation, so we can't call a negated formation a double top. We can only call a confirmed formation it's proper name.

@parisboy -- it's all good. Like me, @BestTraderEv can't help playing devil's advocate. It's in our blood. It's okay for there to be some tension and pushback. It also helps to clear things up for me. You both have the best intentions -- you just need to recognize that and then adapt to the different personalities. In the end I believe we'll create something rather unique and very, very cool...

@parisboy -- another question: The power-of-2 spans (or periods) -- where did that come from? It's too convenient to be theoretical. Was that arrived at empirically?  
  
Actually, I think I know the answer. Those guys at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory were working on missile guidance systems and the computations had to be fast, fast, fast. Computer processors think in binary, and computations using integers that are a power-of-2 don't need to be converted to doubles, or floats. The CPU's used back then would have bogged down if they had to perform a lot of floating-point computations.

I've attached an updated version of the R4M-FocalPoint indicator. It is hot, out of the oven and has never been used in trading, though I will trade it modestly beginning tomorrow. This version differs from the previous in a couple of ways:  
  
1\. In the settings there are two modes to choose from: Strict (default) and Relaxed. Strict uses the FocalPoint algorithm to guesstimate a Target profit, whereas Relaxed can be used for swing trading, as @bishopdotun pointed out earlier.  
  
2\. Strict mode computes a guesstimate target profit. This is not carved in stone and a trend may continue and additional targets may lie ahead. This guesstimate is target #1. If you wish to continue the trade that is up to you. The guesstimated target price is the yellow line.  
  
I am not into hand-holding. If you wish to trade this strategy you will need to revisit and read past posts. I am not going to spend time preparing personalized summaries for every lazy trader who inquires and I hope the other experts here will ignore them, as well. If you demonstrate you've read the posts and still have questions then that's fine. I just don't want the conscientious members here to be taken advantage of by the lazy ones.  
  
There are additional tips I plan on adding, but at this point I want to begin trading it in its simplest form to gain confidence and insight. And it would be appreciated if others would join in, as well.  
  
I will post some additional example charts shortly.

Below I describe one way to trade Focal Points -- there are others that include Double Tops / Bottoms which I plan to add later on. This is the simple version and appears to be very accurate.

Bearish Setup:  
  
FP1 -- Focal Point #1  
FP2 -- Focal Point #2  
High -- Highest price between FP1 and FP2  
Target #1 -- guesstimated target price.  
  
IMPORTANT: Look carefully -- FP2 lies halfway between the High and Target #1. That's the freak'n algorithm. Is that too complex for anyone? If you can subtract two numbers in your head then you don't even need this indi.  
  
The way you trade this is to look for a setup where FP2 has just recently formed. You are looking to Enter a trade shortly after FP2. If FP2 is too many bars in the past then move on and look for a different setup. When FP2 forms then the indi will also compute a guesstimated Target (the yellow line). If the current price suits your R:R then enter a SELL trade with TP set at the yellow line. You can now walk away and do something else -- you don't have to baby sit the trade.  
  
One additional note, I added a filter that requires that SMA(128) be below FP2 (bearish trend) or above FP2 (bullish trend).  
  
I think that about covers it for now.

> I've attached an updated version of the R4M-FocalPoint indicator. It is hot, out of the oven and has never been used in trading, though I will trade it modestly beginning tomorrow. This version differs from the previous in a couple of ways: 1. In the settings there are two modes to choose from: Strict (default) and Relaxed. Strict uses the FocalPoint algorithm to guesstimate a Target profit, whereas Relaxed can be used for swing trading, as @bishopdotun pointed out earlier. 2. Strict mode computes a guesstimate target profit. This is not carved...

It's not back-testable in Strategy Tester. If you understood how it works then you'd know why.

I agree, and that's why I ask for clarification.  
To me it matters that I fully understand.

C'mon, dude! Don't be a cry-baby! The market does not give a Sh.. about our feelings! Take it like a grown-up! I'm not here to like or dislike anybody. I'm here to see if I can give any of my own inputs.  
In my career I have dealt with MA's and I know how they work.  
It is all about when to pull the trigger, and the MA's are only MA's, you see one thing at the given moment, and at the next moment you see a different thing. That's why I'm asking all those questions, because traders see what they want to see and draw false, post hoc conclusions which prove to be BS in real-time trading.  
So, at one monent you see a setup of MA's for a short trade, and you don't see the "false" Double Top.  
You only see it after the fact, later on, maybe just a candle later, but still, you are in a losing trade.

Look at the attached image!  
I don't need anything else than the chart, here, in order to take this trade.  
The SL must be there, taking spread into account, of course.  
The pattern and the signal to look for the Entry Price is on the v-line.  
The TP is guestimated by typical retest levels.  
Now I just need to Enter at such a price, that my RR is better than 1.  
So, what is the purpose of making trading more difficult than it needs to be?

I am not sure what you are getting at, but the only thing I said is that I cant deal with your personality well so I choose not to get into discussions/conversations with you.   
  
You have a strong opinion about things and that's fine, I prefer to have a mind of a child and try everything out I get my hands on and interests me.   
  
I don't care what you are posting here or in any other thread and haven't mentioned anything about it in my previous post either.

Myself, on the contrary, I get more and more tolerant as I get older.  
You have refused to answer my questions, and you have chosen to ignore me.  
How can anybody trust you as an expert?  
If you are an expert in what you present, you should have no problem with answering my questions.

I notice the following:  
1\. Your focal points seem to be in strange places, not the same as presented by @parisboy.  
2\. Your MA's are not plotted back-shifted, as presented by @parisboy.

Yes they are and you could easily check that using MT4's built-in Moving Average. Rather than leaving gaps at the end of the back-shifted SMAs I filled-in the rest of the lines by continuing their slopes. And I posted that awhile back when @parisboy asked about it.  
  
I'm growing weary of this. It's clear now that you are unwilling to take the time to understand the basis of this strategy. Maybe you should start your own thread dedicated to proving you know best.

Until you can demonstrate you understand how Focal Points work I'm not going to respond to your posts. You're treating this as if @parisboy just pulled it out of his ass this week and it's your job to vet it. The rest of us are interested in learning more about Focal Points and how they've been applied to financial instruments. And if we succeed then we have another tool we can add it to our toolbox. You don't have a toolbox. All you have is a screw driver and you use it for everything. I've lost patience...  
  
BTW -- to be clear -- I would never Ignore you (I don't think). You were a great asset in the other thread. But here you've become a waste of my time...

@robots4me It seems to me that the Channels are playing also key role in the decision making of wether a trade should be taken or not shown by parisboy and moeinyzz.  
  
It looks like that the current high + low is taken , but with the main focus of taking the whatever MA is in the midpoint of high and low.  
  
If it can be coded is the question that you have to answer, I dont know anything about coding.  
  
It seemed like the main focus so far were mainly put on the FP (which obviously plays the major role here) but if we (you) can find a consistent way of adding the Channel in the equasion I believe it would be another strong asset to take trades with.

I already have in Trading Journals.  
I also have created an indicator of mine plotting 10 fully customizable averages, set by default to @parisboy settings.  
Would you like me to post it, or you don't want my cooperation any more?  
Those gaps, as you call them, are pretty important to the whole picture and the method, as I can see.  
That's how the equidistant channels are being plotted.  
And, we could, eventually, make the indicator do all those things, plot focal points and the channels.

And, if the whole focal points theory is correct, then I can show you something, if the ratio is 1:1.

It was developed over 60 years ago by engineers working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory -- initially for guided missiles systems and then adapted to financial markets. It is not up to you to decide whether it is correct -- that has already been decided and documented. How many guided missile systems have you designed and who are you to appoint yourself judge and jury over a theory that not only you don't understand, you aren't even willing to put in 10 minutes to grasp its most basic concepts.  
  
I don't care what you, @BestTraderEv thinks about the theory and I don't think anyone else does either. @parisboy and others have been trading it for years. I was also interested in learning it and seeing if I could develop supporting software. But I'm tired battling with you -- I have other trading projects to keep me content and busy. I've lost interest...

Now, let's make our edge better:  
Let's use the Double Top pattern and the PlanetX confirmation signal as the Entry Signal, and let's use RR = 1.618.  
Is the TP at the calculated Focal Point TP level?

Thanks, but no thanks. I'm moving on. You can pick up where I left off or replace my indicator.

So far, Focal Point indicator has evolved into a state that can be used for trading. In my opinion, we may start to see diminishing returns.  
  
There is entry and targets. What else is there? I am happy to see further development as already indicated by BestTraderEv but not sure any further enhancement will necessarily improve results.   
  
Double tops and bottom are still part of an open conversation. I am not clear yet how far that will develop.

I believe there are many small but important points still missing, dont forget that even the smallest change/addition can add a whole different element to it.  
  
never see anything as "complete" in trading.

I am not currently not completely sure if you are making fun of this or not... but this is how I (kind of) imagined how it should be done, not the amount of Channels would need to be obviously filtered out.. could be done (probably) with counting only certain amount of candles backwards... and have potentially only 2 Channels on a chart a "HTF channel" aka "bigger channel" and one more short term.. else we might end up with endless channels, the channels are obviously there to help a trader with his decision making and not make him more confused.  
  
Maybe Parisboy could elaborate on how/when he draws his channels and you coding guys could look if you can put it into code

At the moment I tweaked my old tool, added an option to plot myself the channels. So, I put 5 instances of this tool on the chart and adjust the mid-line color to the MA's color.

So as I get from that we should be looking more closely at double Tops/Bots and use them as a filter when we want to draw a Andrew Fork...  
  
So our steps based on my assumption would be.  
  
Step 1: Identify Double Top/Bot  
Step 2: Identify the local High/Low  
Step 3: Use the MA whichever is in the middle (Yes.. thats describing it very loosely)  
Step 4: Draw Andrew Fork  
  
So maybe once BestTraderEv finishes his 300th channel we could make something useful out of this... potentially..

I plot the like the mid-line was a pivot around which you find the extremes.

Like @parisboy had said, it's not Andrew's Pitchfork.

Step 1: Identify Double Top/Bot Step 2: Identify the local High/Low Step 3: Use the MA whichever is in the middle (Yes.. thats describing it very loosely) Step 4: Draw Andrew Fork So maybe once BestTraderEv finishes his 300th channel we could make something useful out of this... potentially..

Not at all  
  
a) Although I am not a world expert on Double Bottoms and Double Tops,I posted about both patterns with the idea to show that Double Bottoms / Tops are created (at least) by a CMA/ Cycle building successively 2 tops/ bottoms and a CMA/Cycle of Higher degree building its top /bottom in the middle of the others.  
  
Double Tops and Bottoms are just Patterns among others among mainly Head & Shoulders and Tringles. I just wanted to show that Cycles explain how patterns form itself. But the World Expert has concluded that it explains nothing.  
  
b) as for Andrew Forks - it is IMHO only a first and primitive entry on the subject of fork- some good books can give ideas on how to trade "Forks".  
But it is more a collection of recipes, same if you focus only on Chart Patterns for your trading . Anyway I do not use "Andrews Forks" in my trading  
  
There is a marketing part in the Fork Denomination. Practically a "Fork" is just a common channel. Only the Cycle Theory based on centered moving average explains why there are big forks and little forks and why they change direction.

There are 5 MA's on @parisboy charts.  
The most obvious oscillation channel is the one derived from SMA(256)C.

Of course they explain nothing, because it's like saying that butter explains milk.  
It's the other way around.  
The MA's and the maths behind it don't explain anything, they only model, or describe the given thing.  
  
IOW, the chart/the data is the thing, the MA's are the derivative from the chart.  
So, it's the chart which explains the MA's, not the other way!

This is very solid looking, even so it may not be what Paris does... did you check how this looks like on other Pairs? I believe it has potential

Basically, what we see is the nature of these markets/charts, which is like a pendulum, or sine-wave, or oscillation. So the price oscillates around some axis, only that this axis is not always horizontal, and there are many such smaller oscillators inside the bigger ones. So, the smaller oscillation channel SMA(128)C will be like this:

BTW, chart patterns are not __just__ patterns!  
They are a representation of Supply/Demand.  
The patterns that represent some range, like Double Tops/Bottoms, SHS's, etc., represent a range where liquidity is high and buyers find sellers, and sellers find buyers. That's where the banks liquidate their orders - they don't gamble, they must find a buyer for what they are selling.  
That's also why these patterns are so good, because that's where the good prices are.

Thanks for your explanation its greatly appreciated.  
  
To put it simple, I am someone that quit University (studied Informatic) and is now fulltime trading for a few years.  
  
I have a lot of knowledge about psychology, human behaviour and *surprise* Trading.  
  
And what my goal with any indicator is, to find something very consistent. Something clear cut, no confusion is allowed in my trading.  
  
That's why the importance lays for me also "how do we draw the channels in the most consistent way, while it's also ONLY adding confidence in either giving a Bias or for getting into trades."  
  
Likely this can be only done once the Markets are moving, but anyway...  
  
The purpose of my message is that you understand what intentions I have when I am asking or suggesting something.

I have observed this sine-wave nature of charts already some years ago. I don't have any higher education, and in the equivalent of High School I had big problems with maths, physics, chemistry, I hated them all. I learned programming at a pretty late age of my life. So, if I can do it, why can't others, too?  
So, I knew about this sine-wave nature, but really did not do much with this knowledge. I guess the time comes when we are ready to tackle the next level?  
Can this knowledge add anything to our trading?  
I think it can provide more confidence, especially when we are more certain that the price is going to a specific target.  
In trading, this certainty is the most important thing - knowing the Take Profit Price is the most important element in trading.  
It is the main psychological element, because the less we know, the more uncertain we are, and this causes all of the problems traders have with their psychology.

And, that's what was causing me my biggest problems, because I have learned over the years, that entries like that are late, very late, and I learned to enter earlier, but also exit earlier. That's why I asked so many questions. You know, if you've been hit enough times by the market turning on you just when you have entered, this causes psychological trauma.

Not true. You were told MANY times, but were too focused on using your screw driver to prove that is the only tool one needs to build the hill that others were interested in creating. Why pretend you had to learn it the hard way -- tell him they are SMA lines.

Well, you tell him!  
What's the sudden change in your philosophy?  
  
BTW, I did not take the data from text in posts, I took it from an image.  
Then, I took a tool, an indicator I had created a long time ago, and made some tweaks, and I got what I wanted.  
And then, I asked you if you wanted me to post it, here.  
If you had agreed, the tool would be here, ready, no need to ask.

Of course you wouldn't take the text from the posts. Why would you take the simple recipe that @parisboy and I were laying out for everyone -- based on an established, documented algorithm developed years ago and successfully traded today. You were intent on reverse engineering an image so that you could then feel it was your creation. I get it -- you are the guy who always needs to recreate the wheel in his own image. I've worked with those types in the past -- they are "project killers"...

I don't understand how that is a bad thing???  
Like I said, I am not the mathematical type, I don't understand calculus.  
And, I have such a brain that I don't get it until I see it. Reading doesn't help me see it.

The reason why it is a bad thing is for multiple reasons:  
  
(1) The algorithm has already been developed, debugged, tested and traded for decades. Do you really think you are going to be able to recreate all that over a weekend? We stand on the shoulders of giants -- never forget that.  
  
(2) When you recreate the algorithm in your image then you own it, right? No one else can participate because no one else knows what you are doing behind the scenes or what tools you are using.  
  
(3) It wastes time. Why would someone choose to recreate something that was handed to them on a platter -- other than for the ego pleasure it provides.  
  
As for not being the mathematical type -- that's kind of funny. Can you subtract two numbers?  
TargetPrice = FP2 - (High - FP2)  
  
Pretty advanced math, don't you think? Boy, that calculus really throws me...  
  
And don't say you weren't told. @parisboy and I wrote the recipe multiple times but you were too intent on using your screw driver.

Sorry Steve, I don't understand you. How can I use and trust something I don't understand?  
It would be like believing that you are a billionaire just because you told me so.  
Sorry, I can not be that guy.  
  
Plus, you are basically saying, that trading financial instruments has been solved.  
Why are people still losing money, then?  
This includes big guys using those algorythms.

(4) And the time you waste is not just your own. It includes others, as well. You may not care about wasting my time, but I do.  
  
@BestTraderEv -- please carry on. As I mentioned earlier -- I've lost enthusiam to participate. I know you are an honest man and would agree that honesty is the best policy. So, as long as we don't distort the record then I won't comment further on this.

Great, yet most drivers do come back home safe, while 99% traders lose their money in the long run.

You said you don't trust anything you don't understand. You don't understand the intimate details of how internal combustion works, yet you trust driving a car. That was the point. You don't need to understand the finer details of why FocalPoints work -- that has already been done. You only need to understand enough to help members of this thread use them. Or at least help them get to the point where they can evaluate them -- that's all. No one loses any money when evaluating.  
  
@BestTraderEv -- clearly I like you. That must be evident by the fact I haven't yet been suspended again within the past 24 hours. Though I like you, I could never work with you. Every step forward I make, you would drag us back two steps.

Well, I actually do understand the workings of the combustion engine and other parts of a car.  
And, yes, I do tend to research on the important things in life, I like to know where I stand.  
And, your comparisons were fallacious, not in the same category.  
  
I don't want you to like me or dislike me, you don't know me enough to decide - it would be foolish of you to like me or dislike me based on the few interactions we have had. I do not wish to hold you back in any way.  
  
I am a skeptic, which means that I will be looking for hard evidence which would convince me that what one claims actually represents reality.

I know you by heart. I am not Robots4me who is a nice guy and believe in your "honesty". I do not believe in your honesty.  
I had my suspicions since the first time I read you here. 2 or 3 days ago.  
I read all your posts on this thread and some on others thread.  
Technical content tending to zero bound to generalities , evidences (look for good prices, buy low, sell high etc ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)) and even definitive judgments.  
  
All that is characteristical of bullshitters on Trading threads, not the only characteristic but a major one  
  
I have to give you some credit : you are an expert in communication in less than 3 days you positioned yourself as mentor on Price Oscillations, Sinewaves and even Focal Points whose you ignored the existence 2 days ago. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d-1f3fb.png?v=15.1)

You've never worked in a professional software environment, have you? You know how to identify the best developers? They are lazy. They avoid rewriting code that already exists. I can't say how many times a release was delayed due to a crashing bug in a double-linked list that a "code warrior" decided to rewrite himself rather than use the built-in class provided by Microsoft's library that had been tested, put through thousands of hours of QA by dozens of testers and validated by millions of users over the years. You are that type of fellow who will always look for reasons to recreate the wheel because it gives you a sense of personal satisifaction that outweighs what is best for everyone else in the big picture. I attempted several times to coax you along, but failed. And that's fine. And maybe I misjudged you and shouldn't like you -- you're looking more and more like a prick as time goes on.

I never claimed to be a proffesional programer! I self-learned MQL4/5 over the last 11 years, and I know some tricks, and I do use already existing scripts. I do not plan to be wroking in a professional software environment. I just tend to have ideas. And no, I am not that guy who wants, or is going to reinvent the wheel, you got this one wrong. I would reinvent the wheel only if I didn't know the wheel existed. Yes, I am an old prick, and not afraid to admit it.  
  
Though, I wouldn't call you a prick... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/2639-fe0f.png?v=15.1)  
I realise that if you are faced with a choice, you will defend @parisboy and stand against me, but that is not the reason I am here.  
You guys are turning this thread into personal agendas instead of concentrating on the topic!

You are totally wrong about that, as well. I never ignored anything, and I knew about that quite some years ago, already. MA crossovers, like that is anything new... LOL! Or market symmetry... Like, what's new? Pretty basic laws of economy.

No, I am not the best trader ever, LOL! But I have spent the last 11 years sitting on my ass about 14/7 on average studying this whole trading stuff. I have sacrificed a lot, no holidays, no weekends, just damn hard work. Practically no life... Can you beat that?

I'll put it this way:  
The PlanetX oscillator combined with PlanetAwesome additions (what this thread is supposed to be about) fits my style of trading and is a fantastic additive to what I already had before discovering PlanetX.  
This MA's focal points idea is not compatible, it is exactly like I said before - MA's are just MA's and they change.  
You see one thing before you go to bed, and when you wake up, you see another thing, and the price never reached the proposed 1:1 measured from the focal point. And, everything looks fine, because the new focal point worked in the sense of the TP calculation.  
There is one important problem, though - the trader only got a Stop Loss, while they could have taken a sensible RR > 1 Take Profit, if they had only traded by the PlanetX/Awesome signals, because those signals provided a very good entry price where SL was still relatively narrow, while the focal points appear where RR is <= 1, and no retail trader can afford that.

I understand your argument. But the problem is the trader. Retail traders always looking for the holy grail. There isn't. There is no perfect strategy. What wins is MM. In fact MM can turn a strategy of 30% win rate to a profitable strategy. So it's not about hitting stop losses. It's about the several TPs that you can have.

I find M15 a bit noisy. Yeah I get your point.  
  
RR v SL v TP  
  
What if the RR is too small?  
See my next post on how I evaluate this and how I consider trading this method going forward.

30% I doubt, maybe 40%?  
Have you studied the Kelly Criterion?

I wouldn't argue that with you. Take it with a grain of salt but I can tell you that a strategy with 30% win rate can be profitable with the right MM approach.

At 30% Win/Loss you need a Profit Factor of 5 in order to be able to risk 0.5%.  
And, you get to 1% at Profit Factor of 500.  
That is, simply, unrealistic.  
And, the higher the leverage, the less you can risk.  
  
Win/Loss & Profit Factor must be taken from the trader's account history!

Please show me this MM, which gives profits at 30% win rate.  
Just saying will not do.

If RR is too small, that means there is no good opportunity, which means that taking a trade is a bad deal.  
Which means that the trader, who is making bad deals, is on the side of wishing.

@bishopdotun,  
**I absolutely agree that MM is the Holy Grail!**  
MM is RR plus things like Kelly Criterion, which can monitor the trader's performance in the account history, and adjust the risk percent according to this performance. A hedge portfolio strategy can further help minimise this risk.

If you have read the article about 30% win ratio on tradingview, that article is bullshit.  
I can create a spread sheet to show you what will happen in reality if you win 3 out of 10.  
It looks nice presented in percents. Translate that to money, and you will understand why that can't work.  
Every time you lose 3% (for example), you capital is 3% smaller.  
This works as compound loss.

**Notes on PlanetX and Focal Points (SMA Interactions with TF candles)**  
  
So far, we have distilled focal points thanks to contributions of R4m, Parisboy, BestTraderEv e.t.c Lot's of theoretical perspectives and jargons. I am more particular about how it helps me to take good trades and bank some profit everyday. While the "experts" are focused on precision of focal points, I am more interested in the interactions of the SMA and how they indicate swings. That's all that matters. Notice I said SMA interactions. The SMA interactions generate focal points. Sometimes, the interactions occur on exactly the same bar while sometimes they occur within neighbouring bars. We want to trade in the direction of those interactions. That's our clue to trade.  
  
**How can I make profit from SMA Interactions?**  
In the previous notes, I shared how to combine them PlanetX and Focal Points. In this post, I am sharing how to use Focal Points independently. It's the same approach.

  1. Apply Focal Points (Swing Option) to any chart (I prefer EURAUD M30. H1 is also OK)
  2. Place a trade every time you see a new focal point printed.
  3. TP is the Candle ATR. SL is at least 2*Candle ATR (I prefer 3. Yes that sounds crazy but I found that to work very well)
  4. Close on opposite signal (If TP or SL has not kicked in)
  5. Don't ignore your instincts and use your eyes (not your heart)

  
EURAUD M30

You will immediately notice that the focal points keep you on the right side of the trend for much longer than PlanetX. Neither of the 2 is perfect but I like to explore a trend much longer before i switch direction of trade. I don't like jumping up and down every few bars. When a pair is ranging, you will see that clearly and you can adjust your trading and lot size appropriately or just walk away.

Not only sounds, but also is.  
If you lose 3 profits on one trade, and profit 1/3 of that loss on one trade (if you trade fixed lots), you need 3 profits in the row just to recover the loss.  
That's a bad deal!

Again that's wrong assumption.  
  
You are assuming  
\- I risk the same account percentage per trade  
\- That my RR is the same for every trade  
  
You are wrong. Fact is you can't model it that way. I deploy a method that allows me to win variable RR at different times.

Winrate matters and also he may cuts losses short when he sees earlier that the Trade likely wont turn out well.  
  
Depending what instruments I trade, my intial SL might be much bigger than Target, but generally I never let the Market get near my intial SL.

This is a FTMO trial... I run a Trial which copies my Trades, because I like to see how I am doing in intervals and that is an easy way to do it for me.  
  
Anyway doesnt matter if you believe me I take those live too or not, it shows even with a negative RR (just slightly of course) you can make a decent amount of money. (The Trial is a starting balance of 200k)

Assumptions:

  1. If you lose 3: Pick the chart I showed you. count the number of potential trades. Count the number of SL and TP you would have hit. Check the percentage.
  2. you need 3 profits in the row just to recover the loss: you assumed the 3 will hit stop loss: how convenient. Not exactly. That's why you wont trade blind. You will ensure to be there to exit on a new swing. You will also not trade the same account percentage on every trade. I am not about to school anyone on how that works. That's not the goal of this thread.

I will end this conversation right here. You do you. You think you know everything. You don't my friend. You will have to figure it out yourself. If you are a researcher, I doubt you will do well because before you even started you have reached a dead end conclusion.  
  
Everyone has to choose what works for them. I am sharing what works for me but I wont be teaching it like I am paid to do it. Everyone would have to do the hard work. The tools are here on this thread.

Anyway, I dont understand why you, BestTraderEv dont just continue Trading whatever way you want and you just ignore this Thread?  
  
Just move on, you have your own Thread that you started, your playground. You can do whatever you want in this one and trade your markers believes.  
  
If this MA stuff is all nonsense or useless for you then no one forces you to stay

The problem I am having with the FPs is that they seem to be shown very late, so at least when you are a fast Trader the FP points (if you dont show the MAs) have very little use?  
  
Let me show a trade from Today.

Focal Points are not signals or alerts -- that is not how they are used. They are **historical** meeting points of 3 or more SMAs. When the proper setup occurs (see @parisboy's charts) then the **historical** FPs can be used to guesstimate a target price. Again -- the algorithm does not intend for FPs to be used as Entries / Exits. This isn't my idea or even @parisboy's idea -- this is the algorithm that was designed by the rocket engineers that was later adapted for financial instruments.

Yes! I get that, the problem is with the amount of Delay, if my trading day is over and then I see the historical meeting points then its nice to look at, but doesnt help me at all with my Trading and thats what I want from an indicator.  
  
BUT bishopdotun suggested to change from strict to relaxed mode and now the Delay is drastically decreased and its useful for me to look at. The guesstmated Target price was hit before the guesstimated target price got even shown.. which reduces obviously the usage for it for me, the idea of a guestimatted Target is awesome, but at least on LTF during high volatile Market the "strict" mode is too lacking.  
  
It may look differently trading it on HTFs than the 1minute chart.  
  
But again... the relaxed mode does well.

I quote Bishopdotun **"Lot's of theoretical perspectives and jargons. I am more particular about how it helps me to take good trades and bank some profit everyday. While the "experts" are focused on precision of focal points, I am more interested in the interactions of the SMA and how they indicate swings. That's all that matters."**  
  
  
Bishopdotun here and Robots4me some time ago on another thread about TMAEnvelopes play the role of the peasant trader, the feet in the market mud "**I am more interested in the interactions of the SMA and how they indicate swings. That's all that matters.""**  
  
No it is not. It is not all that matters. We are dealing with rational, mathematical qualities and consequences of (centered) Moving Averages and the automatic, systematic consequences they have on our trading. Focal Points are not magical, mysterious, coming from nowhere. Focal Points are the end result of a mathematical process.  
  
Already in his book profit Magic Hurst (1970) explains that when the Full Period Centered Moving Average , let's say CMA 32 intersects the Half Period Centered Moving Average, hence CMA 16 at the same price bar then we are in the middle of Price Action Swing.  
  
Great ! Then we can calculate with a high degree of probability that Price Action has made a Top or a Low.  
  
Unfortunately for the simple minded guy who has his feet in market mud :  
  
when Price makes its Top CMA 16 is 8 bars behind because of its structural Lag (8 bars) and CMA 32 is 16 bars behind in the middle of the swing (Focal Point 16/32) because of its structural Lag (16 bars)  
  
this means that when CMA 16 makes its Top , Price is already 8 bars sideways or down and when CMA 32 makes also its top Price is already 16 bars sideways or/ down  
  
Basic Focal Points (2 CMA's intersecting at the same price) will ALWAYS be "_late_ ", that is the nature of the beast.  
  
But Basic Focal Points confirm you that Price is changing direction (sideways or opposite trend)  
  
Are you interested ? Find you these qualities of Focal Point useful in your trading ?  
  
But Bishopdotun has underlined it will be better if we can use Focal Points to make some money.  
  
This will be the subject of next messages. We are all interested to know "_how to bank some profit every day"_ to quote bishopdotun.

You're right. But the "relaxed" mode is my invention and is not part of the original theory or algorithm. It's never been tested or traded. At this point it just looks pretty. The original algorithm as presented by @parisboy was developed by rocket scientists and adapted for financial markets decades ago. There is no way my invention over this past weekend can compare. I mean, maybe I'm a genius and when the folks at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory see the PlanetX indicator they will hire me to design their next guided missile system -- though, I wouldn't bet any money. I have yet to explore the original Focal Point algorithm, and that's why I'm not much interested in already fiddling with variations of it.

Yes I understand your point and I am sure there is MUCH more to what Parisboy is doing and what those missle folks were using.   
  
Just as it currently stands, for my trading the relaxed mode has more use to me than the strict mode. It gives a great confirmation/suggestion where the price is more likely headed. Up or Down.

I wouldn't be so sure. Keep in mind the SMA lines are backshifted and do not take into account the most recent bars. If the market changes then things could get ugly. I don't know -- again, this came straight to you from my laptop. This is why I prefer sticking with the original algorithm -- it has had decades to mature and be traded.

@parisboy -- I've learned to tread carefully when questioning or disagreeing with @bishopdotun -- he is the most brilliant man I've ever met.  
  
However, I agree with most of your post. I think you've hit the nail on the head. @IKnowBestAlways -- I mean @BestTraderEv -- kind of dragged things down the rabbit hole. Focal Points, Double Tops/Bottoms are new and different. I think they are valuable tools to add to our toolbox. At this point I really don't understand the interest in fiddling with variations.

Again -- the algorithm does not intend for FPs to be used as Entries / Exits. This isn't my idea or even @parisboy's idea -- this is the algorithm that was designed by the rocket engineers that was later adapted for financial instruments.

Focal Points are alerts or signals  
  
Focal Points signal you that :  
  
2 Centered Moving Averages and Price have crossed at the same Price Bar (that is the ideal case)  
then it alerts you that you face a "candidate" Top" or "Low" , then a potential Change in Trend (sideways or opposite trend)  
  
Hence you can avoid an entry at the end of the trend - going nowhere or being counter trending

We are using terminology a bit differently. In my world, a signal means this is where you Enter/Exit. I think in your world a signal is a clue to be applied along with some other considerations before entering / exiting a trade. Is that a fair statement?

Another set of assumptions that are neither right nor wrong. I have read everything so far.  
  
Focal points alert you of the direction of the market. I want to trade in that direction. That's all that matters. However, your approach has other benefits. It can estimate potential targets. The flaw in that estimate is that it is not definitive. The market can reach the target or it can fail. Estimates can never be assertive. The only thing that's assertive is that at that point in time when the focal point was printed, the market was headed in that direction or has changed direction.  
  
My approach was to use that clue to start trading. I then provided charts to support that. It's there in my previous posts. If you read my post, you wouldn't write the sarcasm in the last sentence of your post. I also suggested that taking small bites all the way till the market changes direction makes more sense to me. hit several M30 or H1 ATRs till you see a flat market or reversal makes more sense to me. In your approach, you provided the direction of estimating the targets. Neither is wrong or right. That's why it's important that everyone finds what works for them.  
  
The only thing certain about focal points is the direction of the market at that point in time. Targets are only estimates. They are not definitive. Hence my approach of taking bites progressively with a moderate TP based on the TF ATR characteristics. That's how you bank some profits everyday.

First thing, I see on your charts, that your my kind of trader! Places where you enter are basically what I'm talking about.  
  
Why am I here? Because of the other @ohitsyou thread, and that @robots4me basically wanted me to take over his thread and start one like this, but I did not want. You see, all of the sudden he was my buddy, and all of another sudden he doesn't like me any more and isn't my buddy any more. I wanted to take part in the development of a good system with the aid if his oscillator, and that's why I'm here. But, (never start with "but" ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)) it turned out he is some kind of... (I wanted to provide psychoanalysis, but I bit my toungue...).  
  
Never mind...  
  
BTW, sure, no one forces me to stay, yet this thread was started about the PlanetX/Awesome methods, not about MA's focal points.  
@parisboy invaded this thread by brute force, and immediatelly got the OP's green light.

it is a fair statement.  
  
let's say a Focal Point in itself is a Signal that Price has made a Low or a Top - let's say it is an Alert that Trend is changing  
  
Is it an Action Signal to enter Long or short. It depends of how you change direction.  
  
Is price going sideways first ( conflicting short term cycles) or Price is making a sharp Top or Bottom  
  
It is where statistics can be useful  
  
The best to understand how it works is to show examples

How about, if you entered at the end of a trend, just accept the Stop Loss, no?

Dude -- recall I gave you my sources. I told you I was about to be banned because DrDave and tommydoginti hate me and knew that @ohitsyou was a double alias. I emphasized the urgency and you said you'd like to continue the original PlanetX thread. After you received my sources you then said you'd continue with a new thread "when you were ready". Remember that? But by then it was too late. I realized at that point that you weren't very reliable and that you didn't place much value in keeping your word.  
  
Later I said I still liked you but couldn't work with you. And you responded it wasn't important to you whether or not I liked you. But now you complain we're not buddies?  
  
In addition to being a one-tool trader -- you are also a slow learner. We've wanted you gone from this thread many posts ago, but you don't get the message.

On this chart my target using an ESTIMATED Focal Point 163264128256 would be 1,49140 +/- 74  
  
Because Top = 1,49880  
Estimated Focal Point = 1,49510  
  
Swing estimation is 2 x 370 = 740 +/- 10 % = 740 +/- 74  
  
THis means in this Price Zone which can go a little lower, depending on the real 5 CMA Crossing , but not much, probability is very high that there is a change in trend - sideways or / then Up  
  
It where computer calculation can give us a precise FP number, then a (more) precise Target Zone

@KnowItAll -- and how are you going to test this? You're going to search through charts and charts to find an example where it doesn't hold? That doesn't meet the criterium of a valid test. I'd say it's more like 5 years and 1000 trades on a live account. Please return here when you've finalized the results and can prove they are statistically valid.

I have a question: Focal Points occur in the past, right? What's the oldest Focal Pont you would trust? Even if it were 50 bars ago would you still trust it as long as the guesstimated target price would provide a win?   
  
I'm used to trading signals in real-time -- like right now. So, I'm a bit uncomfortable relying on a Focal Point that was created yesterday or the day before. Do you know what I mean?

Another question: The SMA(256) extension is just a continuation of the slope -- i.e. extrapolation. If the market had recently changed that SMA256 extension would still be there because the indicator drawing had ended long ago and it is not based on recent price data. Isn't that a concern?

So, I am reading this correctly?  
The yellow elipse is the focal point, and the projection of the mid-line in the channel is the expected target for a Long?  
(At this moment I'm just eyeing it, not calculating precisely.)

So, when the first Oscillator Bullish signal appeared (pointed by the yellow arrow), the DeepPink MA was where the other big yellow arrow is pointing.

thats a great Chart, I have taken a similar Trade for 1% profits.. but I made a mistake closing the Trade too early (not because its now going, but based on my rules).  
I should be up close to 3% instead.  
  
I wont share the Charts since it has little to do with the Thread.  
  
but your chart including the Channel is great

I have just realised something!  
It is my maths' problem that I've always been having - this is about angles - and that part of maths I hated the most and could never grasp.  
I have been in these areas before, but couldn't make sense of it.  
I went more by the path of Fibonacci, but no angles.  
You know, the ballistic missiles thing - angles.

So, this is the proper "explanation" of EURAUDH1 situation - the Brown MA where it was when the DeepPink MA made a Focal point.

I do not think so. Because I dosome things manually.  
  
Hence, if the case, I can observe the slope(s) (mainly 256 and 128 ) changing.  
  
Then I recalibrate (reprecise if necessary, the initial approximative target price

thank you JS497 for your post.  
  
If I understand your post correctly. It is logical. As the system is based on Cycles underlined by Centered Moving Averages (templates for Envelopes), your count shows us that the "model)" 16/32/64/128/256 is very robust and close to reality  
  
such statistics are very useful

your statistics show an almost by the book example of Cylicality  
  
_= > 256(-128) crosses 64(-32) => average of 4  
=> 256(-128) crosses 32(-16) => average of 8  
=> 256(-128) crosses 16(-8) => average of 16  
=> etc..._  
  
what do you infer from this result ?

Thats why i posted it, you have asked me it in the past already, without can answer you justly. No problem ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f603.png?v=15.1).  
  
Exactely, its logicaly a good average.  
Too what we can look is that low to cross (or high to cross) are represented by 2/3 of period from low to high (or high to low or cross to cross), and the rest, means cross to high (or cross to low) are represented 1/3 of low to high (or high to low, or cross to cross), almost.  
  
We can see too some occurences with numbers of crossing between some CMA. Logical.

they are symetrical, for example ; when you get 2xCrossing (high to high or low to low) from cycle 128(-64) and 64(-32), you are in the half of cycle 256(-128) and 128(-64) in average historically

right. This means that we are more or less in Cyclic Mode.  
  
When we are in a Trending mode UP Cycles make their Tops on the right and can be shorter in Time.

Okay -- then as a programmer I would apply the following rule:  
  
If the SMA extensions don't make sense with the most recent bar data then the guesstimated target price should be ignored. And as for the definition of "what makes sense", that is left to the discretionary trader. Is that a fair statement?

Thanks to [Parisboy](https://www.forexfactory.com/parisboy) and [R4M](https://www.forexfactory.com/robots4me), we now have a great tool (Focal Point Indicator) to complement PlanetX.

I have updates of:  
**PlanetAwesome-Oscilator-v5.2.ex4**  
Improved histogram visuals on different zooms.  
  
and **PlanetAwesome-OnChart-Signals.ex4**  
Early AO signals on chart.  
  
Plus I have **BTE_10_Moving_Averages.ex4** an indicator which can plot up to 10 fully customizable moving averages. By default, 5 of them are preset to @parisboy MA's parameters. This indicator has an On/Off button, so we can easily switch the MA's On and Off.  
  
I am still willing to cooperate if you are too.

Okay -- but it looks to me that trade was opened south of the target price calculated using the following formula:  
  
TargetPrice = FP2 - (High - FP2)  
  
In other words, because you are a wild and crazy guy and looking for adventure you still opened a SELL trade long after the TargetPrice had been reached. Is that a fair statement? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Excellent -- I think I've reproduced your EURAUD / M1 chart.  
  
But there is still one important piece that I am missing. On the X-axis, can you draw an arrow to show me the **earliest** time you could have entered the trade with the guesstimated 'TargetPrice' being your TP.

And another question: There are two other peaks that occur before FP2 -- why didn't you use either of these as the Top? What criteria or rule did you apply when deciding to use 1.49334 as the Top (instead of the others that are closer to FP2)?

PS: Okay, I think I know. It's because that's the tallest peak between FP2 and FP1, where FP1 is the FocalPoint that occurs around 17:48, right?

Difficult to say because chart has moved and we can not recreate the conditions.  
  
Seems the trade was not so bad planned but I was wiped out at stop-loss as I was reading your post. Shit happens ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

What's particularly interesting to me is that even though FP2 occurs in the middle of a strong upswing, the FocalPoint algorithm computes a guesstimated TargetPrice that recommends a SELL. And in hindsight it would have been correct.   
  
What it feels like to me is that after FP2 forms you Enter a trade and then ignore all subsequent bars because they won't have any effect on the guesstimated TargetPrice. You need to have faith that the algorithm will eventually smile on you even while the most recent bars might say otherwise. Is that a fair statement?

Sorry about that -- you should know better to ignore me if you're trading M1...  
  
And thanks for your response -- I'm getting a better sense of this now. I'm primarily trying to find the proper boundary between what's discretionary and what can be coded to facilitate trading Focal Points.

that is the point.  
  
1 mn is IMHO necessary for TRAINING because **1 Minute = 1 Bar**  
  
**CMA 16 has a Lag of 8 Minutes**  
**CMA 32 a Lag of 16 minutes**  
**CMA 64 a Lag of 32 minutes**  
**CMA 128 a Lag of 64 minutes**  
**CMA 256 a Lag of 128 minutes**

it is a fair statement.  
  
a) you need experience I had already seen many time this pattern It is where operative statistics would be beneficial  
b) you need to alternate your screen to SEE the difference between the Price Chart and the CMA chart in some specific condition your trade can be in red when most CMA's go south. Curious feeling.  
c) you need to understand fully how work the Lags  
  
You need to understand the relative positions between the Tops (or Lows) and the CMA's crossings and the position of Price (number of bars after the Top or Low ) when the Focal Point is confirmed with additional CMA's

It is easy to see that Centered Moving Average 128 is in the middle of successive Swings of EURAUD 1 mn Price Action

Relying on SMA(128) really helps make it easier to identify potential FPs.  
  
The chart below includes a Fractal Channel indicator -- I think it serves a similar role as the channel lines you've drawn. In a bearish trend, I'm looking for SMA(128) to remain either within or below the fractal channel. If that condition holds -- even many bars after FP2 -- then I'm still fine opening a SELL trade. However, if SMA(128) has broken out of the Fractal Channel then I go looking for another setup.

Since we are exchanging old-man stories, I'll share one of my "brushes-with-fame"...  
  
I returned to college at 35 to study computer science. My lab partner was Rod Brock -- another old guy. Rod had been the owner / President of Seattle Computers. He sold MS-DOS to Bill Gates for $50K. Bill Gates' parents were lawyers with connections to IBM. Bill Gates turned around and sold MS-DOS to IBM for $10 million, and Microsoft was born.  
  
I remember having lunch with Rod and he told me the next great app would be GPS location on your computer. In my visionary way I disagreed and said I didn't think people would be interested in using computers for navigation purposes. And in the early '90s I remember arguing with friends that I didn't think anything would come of the Internet. I have since changed my opinion...

WTH, I can share it even if some guys don't want it!  
Whoever is ignoring me, their bad:  
  
PS. We can set MA #6 to Period 1, Price Close, Method Simple, Shift 0, and thus recreate the Line chart as the Bid Price Line Chart.  
  
**The button works when _Indi_On_ is set to _false_!  
  
If you can't see the button, check _ButtonSubWindow_ , _ButtonX_ , _ButtonY_!**

I've got a practical method, here:  
1\. Identify the previous market (High Point to Low Point) which the current PA is the part of,  
2\. Identify the Focal Points - MA crosses with price,  
3\. Plot the middle line across the Focal Point which is available at the given moment.  
4\. The channel should span from the High to the Low of the branch where the FP's are,  
5\. The channel angle needs to be based on Double Top/Bottom High/Lows.  
  
Then we can use other chart levels, like specific prices and/or signals.  
If we get a nice confluence, we are pretty good to trade!  
  
Try this! Comment how this works.

It seems that both FP's work well enough:

You still don't get it. What you posted has nothing to do with @parisboy's attempt to explain the Focal Points algorithm. You are hijacking the Focal Points algorithm to create something in your own image. Go away. You have your own thread. Call your algorithm something else like "Know It All's Intersections". Stop using the term "Focal Points" in your algorithm because you are corrupting the terminology and introducing confusion.

Actually, the guys here were ridiculing me for "KnowItAll", yet I want to show you something.  
This is what I was saying before, that the MA's are derived from the charts, not the other way.  
This is what I mean:  
MA's model what's on the charts.  
On the charts we have trending candles/patterns and ranging candles/patterns.  
If we understand that there are only various ranges, the whole market is a range, then we can start looking for markets inside markets (High to Low).  
So, do we really need those MA's in order to plot what I have shown above?  
No, we don't.  
We just need to do the same as in my example above, because the FP's are going to be somewhere in the middle of the local range (consolidation) which will also be somewhere in the middle of the High-Low Range.  
And the last thing will be to find the angle.  
  
I can agree that those calculations can give much more precise estimations, but do we really need to be all that precise?  
We only do if we are doing HFT on servers at the exchanges.  
If we are on the retail trader side, we don't have the means to fight for the last digits of the price.  
  
See, the FP's will necessarily be there, by definition of the MA's:

To all...  
  
The past few days, we have been trying to get around oscillators. Parisboy, R4m, BTEv e.t.c have contributed immensely in different capacity. However, I feel things are a bit stuck. There is a bit of disjointed argument over the Focal Point concept. Parisboy and R4m seem to be aligned on the concept and the 2 have fleshed out what used to be some alien concept which Parisboy has been showing on his charts. The contention between some parties on the thread is polluting the progress of the conversation and unfortunately, I have to make a choice. Be nice to everyone and allow the thread to derail into some gladiators arena or be a bit rude for a brief time so that something good can be allowed to thrive. I go with the later.  
  
I need not say more. I will therefore ignore BTEv for a while. I tried for things not to get this far so all can be involved but if I don't do this the thread will degenerate and I would not want that for the sake of the readers. In a few more days, I expect R4m, Parisboy and other contributors to reach some reasonable conclusion on a useable indicator that represents the Focal Point concept. I will not permit any further noise.  
  
I apologise for this needed action.  
  
Cheers,  
BD.

Hi guys,  
  
Thanks for the great work and insights.  
  
@robots4me is there any chance you can add number of bars for the '[OIY-PlanetX-Hist-v8.0.ex4](https://www.forexfactory.com/attachment.php/4165656?attachmentid=4165656&d=1647503207)' indicator?  
  
Reason is simply to be able to back test. I hope this is a small change to an already great indicator!  
  
Thanks in advance.

The Focal Points strategy deserves a thread of its own -- its a shame that @BestTraderEv insisted on corrupting the original strategy for the purpose of creating something in his name that is totally unrelated. I'm interested in sharing with y'all a new strategy and tool -- for which I am indebted to @parisboy -- and have no desire to constantly battle with the best trader ever. So, with @bishopdotun's blessing, I'm migrating my interpretation of the Focal Points strategy to a new thread: "Trading Focal Points -- A Leap Of Faith..." ([https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...-leap-of-faith](https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/1146109-trading-focal-points-a-leap-of-faith)).

**SMA Intersections (SMAI)**  
  
R4m made this indicator.  
This indicator is a by-product of Focal Point conversation. Now that focal point has moved to its new home, we can continue PlanetX and SMAI.  
SMAI plots areas where there is interactions between 2 or more SMAs within neighbouring bars. There are 2 settings:  
\- FocalPoint Size (in bars): Number of bars within which the SMA must have interacted with a bar. I use 8.  
\- FocalPoint Strength: Number of SMAs to have interacted with neighbouring bars. I use 2.  
\- Toggle Back-shifting: True or false to back-shift the MA. I set this to false to use recent SMA data.  
  
I have added SMAI to the PlanetX tool box on the first post.  
Swing Direction: Direction of the most recent SMAI swing sets the direction of trade  
Entries and Exit: PlanetX  
**Warning** : I have preference for EURAUD / M30  
  
EURAUD M30

I am not getting the same signals, as you have, though in the more-or-less the same places.  
This is another thing I have noticed, that even moving averages do not plot the same on different brokers.

Back to our topic, I took this trade, today. Oscillators did help in the sense that I did not dare trade against them.  
Otherwise, it was the market that the price broke down from, and the identification of the new market the price was trading in. So, it was like this:

Time frame you are trading matters. A long signal on M1 can just be a failed reversal on H1. The M1 trade would have profited. That does not necessarily invalidate the H1 signal. The market consist of cycles within cycles. You just need to trade what suits your style.

If I may comment about these SMAI, without anybody getting insulted, you also need to be able to place those SMA's into a specific context. They will only work in a sideways market, and in a specific range. If the market is trending, and/or out of that range, you need to look for further, longer values of SMA's. Of course, you can follow the same pattern of peridos and shifts. Nevertheless, the secret does not lie in the SMA's themselves, but rather in the skills of the trader who needs to adjust their indicators to their markets they are trading.  
  
The person I alluded to made a Long trade on M1, yesterday, then got crushed by the market miserably, and removed the charts from this thread. I saw it. Others might have not. I have some evidence, because I liked one of those posts, so the info is in my profile stats. And it links to nothing, now.

I am that way, sorry that you can't accept that people may be different.  
You see, I actually cared to study your presented ideas and I was saying exactly the same things you were saying, but some others said I was saying something different.  
I am not saying that the FP's etc. don't have their application, they do.  
It is you who doesn't want to listen to anybody, because You Know The Best!  
I regret this outcome, but this is my last post directed to you.  
Good Luck at your hobby! Have fun.  
  
BTW. I made a fun indicator with the SMA's!  
And, I do have question to you, but you won't answer.

Only few hours and you have corrupted this space again. Now I will permanently ignore you. You have your own thread. You can post all your content there. I wish you all the best. I need this space to be without conflict.

Sorry my fellow traders....I thought I was in Parisboys thread...I will remove my posts here today.  
  
By the way, anyone who gets "crushed" is either a fool or is not trading with stops...simple as that.

Come on -- "crushed" is a relative term. @parisboy is a humble man and he was just reminding less experienced traders that even an experienced trader has losses. And please don't bring up StopLosses -- a totally unrelated topic. And from your comment it's clear you are what is called a one-trick pony. Have you ever heard of money management? What about algorithmic exits? Different trading styles benefit from different approaches to SL.
