Wellcome FXtrader _!  
Be aware some points, please before beginning to read the TCT trading system below.  
  
Radical acceptance is a key mental strategy for coping with market uncertainty. Many traders make the mistake of thinking they can control the markets. Nobody can control the markets. We must learn to accept anything that comes our way and to trade accordingly. Adopt the attitude that trading is a journey and that all we can do is go where the markets take us. Another thing you can do is to make sure you have a life. Trading can be addictive especially when you are winning. Do not put all your emotional eggs in the trading basket. You need to have other roles that give your life meaning and purpose. By defining your identity in a variety of ways, you will not place un-natural importance on trading events. Therefore, you will be able to take losses in stride and look at your trading more objectively. Might be better also, to accept your limitations and work around them, ...and become a winning trader. Possibly, write out your trading plan with precise entry and exit points and as well important, test your system on paper and when confident test in real time with the minimum contract size. You will have losing trades, accept them with grace and go on to the next trade._ _  
So you need to make sure your trading system fits your trading personality; otherwise you will find it hard to follow it. Every trader has different needs and goals, thus there is no system that perfectly fits all traders. You need to make your own research on various trading styles and technical indicators until you find a concept that perfectly works for you. Make sure you know the nature of whatever technical indicator used. _  
  
_May be Time Cell Trading could something for you by finding several trading systems or strategies that suits your life - not the other way around!_  
  
Now let us speak the topic.  
  
Time Cell Trading (TCT) is a manual trading strategy. Trades could be triggered within different time frames and can used in ranging and in trending markets. TCT has used since 2004. You can use Time Cell Trading strategy only by using the CCI(14) tops and bottoms in combination with the price action (e.g. engulfing patterns, hammers, shooting stars, in bars). It's simple and efficient! If you will get other arguments more, so look at the extreme points at murrey math or/and at the pivotal points. The EMA lines will show you apart from price action momentum and if there is either a trending environment or a ranging market.  
  
So let's show you the indicators and then a few examples (see "Trade Examples").  
  
Indicators  
\- CCI (14)* & RSI (14)  
\- Murrey Math*  
\- Pivot Points*

\- EMA 10 (9), 20, 50 (55), 100 (120), 200   
  
Optional: Price action*, trendlines*, Fibonacci  
  
*Preferred Indicators  
  
Also I have some simple exponential moving averages e.g. EMA10 & EMA20 to give me clues on the strength of a trend and the likelihood of mass traders entry, also an EMA 200 as a long term moving s/r.

Market Tip*: In Forex we don't have the burdon of financial statements by itself. However, we can still analyze a currency's condition (strength or weakness) based on a number of factors. Combined, these give us a better indication of a particular trade's worthiness. If you insist upon predicting future movement (and I wish you wouldn't), you should be familiar with a minimum: (1) The currency's behavioral characteristics, say how much does it move (hourly?, daily?, weekly?), does it moves abruptly?, graduelly?, does it spike?; then (2) the economies of the currency pairs (strong?, weak?, budget deficits or surplius?); (3) The general market trend (up, still, down); (4) where the current market price is relative to today's movement, yesterday's-, last week's-, last month's-; (5) how do the microcharts (M1, M5, M15, M30, H1) relates to the macro- (4h, daily, weekly, monthly); and so on.

EURJPY, M1  
  
EURJPY, M1  
Sell & Buy Signals:  
Sell at CCI (14) peaks over 200 or at the RSI tops and buy at valleys under 200 closed by pivot points or murrey math lines.  
  
Minus:   
M1 trading will give you a lot of false signals, so may be it's better to favorite more a global look, e.g. at M5 and M15 when scalping at M1.

EURJPY, M5  
  
Divergence:  
Look at the CCI (14) divergence between 12:30 and 12:55 (GMT +1) and sell at the descending peak, where the candle hits the EMA 100 (Point 2).  
  
  
Preferred trades:   
(1) Enter Long, (2) Exit & Enter Short, (3) Exit & Enter Long, (4) Exit  
  
Range trading:  
18:15 - 22:55 (GMT +1): rangebound trading (upper and bottom line at Bollinger Band) by taking the entries and exits at M1.  
Point 5-12 has pointed out the range bound trading, when switching at M15/M30/H1 you could see often indifferent candles.  
  
Preffered trades:   
(5) Enter Long, (6) Exit & Enter Short, (7) Exit 6 Enter Long, (8) Exit & Enet Short, (9) Exit & Enter Long, (10) Exit & Enter Short, (11) Exit & Enter Long, (12) Exit.  
These trades should be executed at M1 with regard at M5.

EURJPY, M15  
  
As long as EMA lines 10, 20, (may be 50) are running side by side let your win run.  
Focus at CCI (14) peaks and valleys in conjunction with Pivots and/or Murrey Math lines and/or EMA lines - the more the merrier.

Focus at the H4 support line at the ascending price pathway and buy at the pullbacks (together at the bottom line of the bollinger band)  
  
July 12 4:00 - July 20 12:00 (GMT+1): H4 moves in a range at parallell running Ema lines. Trade M1, M5, M15.

**murrey math  
  
1\. Line 8/8 & 0/8 (Ultimate Support and Ultimate Resistance).**  
Those lines are the most strong concerning Support and resistance.  
  
**2\. Line 7/8 (Weak, Place to Stop and Reverse).**  
This line is weak. If suddenly the price was going too fast and too far and stops around this line it means the price will reverse down very soon. If the price did not stop near this line this price will continue the movement to the line 8/8.  
  
** 3\. Line 1/8 (Weak, Place to Stop and Reverse).**  
This line is weak. If suddenly the price was going too fast and too far and stops around this line it means the price will reverse up very soon. If the price did not stop near this line this price will continue the movement down to the line 0/8.  
  
** 4\. Line 2/8 and 6/8 (Pivot, Reverse)**  
Those two lines yield the line 4/8 only to the strength to reverse the price movement.  
  
** 5\. Line 5/8 (Top of Trading Range)**  
The price is spending the about 40% of the time on the movement between the lines 5/8 and 3/8. If the price is moving near line 5/8 and stopping near the line during the 10 - 12 days so it means that it is necessary to sell in this "bonus zone" (some people are doing like this) but if the price is keeping the tendency to stay above 5/8 line, so it means that the price will be above. But if the price is droping below 5/8 line it means that the price will continue falling to the next level of resistance.  
  
**6\. Line 3/8 (Bottom of Trading Range).**   
If the price is below this line and in uptrend it means that it will be very difficult for the price to break this level. If the price broke this line during the uptrend and staying above during the 10- 12 days it means that the price will be above this line during the 40% of its time moving between this line and 5/8 line.  
  
** 7\. Line 4/8 (Major Support/Resistance Line).**  
It is the major line concerning support and resistance. This leve is the better for the new sell or buy. It is the strong level of support of the price is above 4/8. It is the fine resistance line if the price is below this 4/8 line.

Trading style  
  
TCT allows making money at all timeframes (M1, M5, M15, M30, H1, H4, Daily, Weekly).   
  
How to use the indicators?  
In shorter time frames M1, M5, M30 I like the Murrey Maths, at H4 or daily the Pivots are preferred.  
CCI & RSI: Peaks & valleys are most powerful at all time frames, favored at M5, M15, H4, Daily.  
  
Example:   
Take a look at the M1, M5, M15 and H4 charts above, please.  
Time cell trading:  
It's easy to make pips in the downward movements with several enter shorts at M1, M5 and M15 with coincident H4 enter long trades.

Entry and Exit with a higher probability of making a profit  
Entries and Exits are most powerful when you see the tops & peaks (CCI, RSI) near Pivotal Points and/or S & R lines, and/or Murrey Math Lines and/or EMA Lines.   
You can also take a look moreover at the candlestick formation (engulfing patterns, umbrella lines like the hammer or the hanging man, shooting star, harami cross [petrifying pattern], doji, falling window, dumpling top, high-price gapping play, rising three methods, tasuki, tower top and tower bottom, in-neck-line, pan bottom, separating lines, night attack, thrusting line, three mountain top, box range...)

Divergence Trading with CCI  
CCI(14) divergence can be often focus at M5 or M15 for the confirmation of a trend change in conjunction with the pivotal points or Murrey Math. Please keep in mind that I use divergence as an _indicator,_ not a signal to enter a trade!, like [http://www.babypips.com/school/how_t...gences.htmlhad](http://www.babypips.com/school/how_to_trade_divergences.htmlhad) has exactly described. So you could put in an oscillator like MACD or Stochastic as well, ...the problem is that in some case you didn't find a MACD divergence, when you'll find one at CCI or RSI, so I pefere to focus the CCI at M5 and M15 (and may be at M30 and higher time frames)**.  
  
** If you take a look at the EURJPY, M5 example #[**3**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3913395&postcount=3) above, you will be aware of the regular bearish divergence exactly when the price bar has reached at EMA100 & DS2 at 112.65 - so there were three powerful arguments for going short, ...so this trade could have a higher probabilitiy (likelyhood) for a profit taking.  
  
The frame below shows the principle of divergence (here now with rsi). Be aware that it exists a hidden divergence moreover.

TCT with USDCHF is favored at H1, H4 & Daily.  
  
_Make your experience when trading TCT which time frames could be favored for other currency pairs, e.g.: EURUSD, EURJPY, USDCAD, ..._

Hi fguru  
  
Yes of course. I have open trades which are on an average 30% - 50% when the account has account for wins (to show a profit from minimum 25%). 80% of then run in the wins sooner or later. So I have hedged several positions.

there are no secrets, only experience over 8 years, discipline and the high art of wait.

Start 15 demo accounts, on each account don't take any losing trades.  
Wait for the market to come back to your entry, plus a couple pips.  
  
After two weeks, take the account with the largest gain, perhaps the only one left. The other accounts margin called or busted or flat.  
  
Post that in a thread with some very vague "system" description.  
Magic! Your system is fantastic! You're up +400%.  
  
You forget to mention the other 14 margin called accounts which are down a total of net -1000%.  
  
I'm not saying that is what Forexcube is doing. But you could get similar results that way.   
  
Perhaps you could start a fresh account that we could see from the beginning and keep it going for a couple months?   
  
I'm very interested in your system and results.  
Thanks and good luck.  
  
P.S. The equity on this demo account is at 48% of balance value at this moment, could you "unlock" the Open Trades section and let us see how many losing trades you are holding at the moment? Potentially, depending on size of those positions you could be margin-called by Monday or Tuesday if you've been shorting the EUR/USD?

Sorry Intu  
  
I have a complete other money management. If I have doubling one account I transfer all this money to my private account and start again. So I do it with the Demo's too. Then 50% of the wins of every old account will transfer to the new account. Why?,...due to the fact that two or three days in a year market moves extremly At these phase traders lost much/most of his money. Be aware of these market turmoil which coming up completely unexpected. Keep the odd money!  
  
and look at this what brokers are writing when opening a real account._  
"When trading online, you should be aware that during periods of high internet traffic, you might experience delays in accessing account data due to systems capacity limitations. Additionally, system response times may be adversely affected by increased market volatility conditions, quote delays, system performance; and other factors outside of our control, which may include your computer system and internet service provider. You may also experience system outages or delays as a result of, among other things, power failures, programming failures or heavy trading volume. During periods of increased volatility, you might suffer market losses in the price and lot size of a particular pair when systems problems result in an inability to place buy or sell orders. The risk of financial loss in trading online can be substantial; therefore, you should consider whether such trading is suitable for you in light of your circumstances and financial resources."_

I have no bad intention, I am naturally skeptical of such fantastic results.  
  
I don't mean to invade your thread, just looking for clarification of your methods.

Come on Intu  
  
This is a new account what I post here on this thread. If you don't trust you can bet with me that I trade 6 months or 1 year the same account (with all transfer when doubling) in the profit and you'll see if you will challenge (doubt) in the future!

Ladies and gentlemen, after reading with some amusement a few of the purported "trading systems" discussed on this forum, a thought occurred to me.   
  
If I developed a sure fire trading system that won 90-95% of the time, not only wouldn't I discuss it on a forum, I would lock it into the deepest vault I could find and never, ever disclose it to anyone. I would use it to make tons of money.  
  
Can one of the wise men or wise ladies on the forum explain to me why anyone would share a winning trading system with others?  
  
This is a serious question, because something doesn't make sense.  
  
Otherwise, this is a great forum.

48%from +443% profit is much more then over 100% profit from 25'000.-$, say more then 60'000.-$ net!  
  
  
Keep in mind, please and accept my willingness, that I post all what I will post here just now, please,... and take a look at the real results without depreciate it! More then 100% within one month!  
  
Am I sorry about this success? I don't think so!

Why not? You dont want to see other people earning money? If you have developed a system that wins 90-95% of the time, then be happy and make money, but why not share it with others? You wont be less successful if other people use the same system or will you?

Hi there, I know it's your thread so you can post pretty much what you want but just show us some real trades from your account history(with all the statistics) and drag them on your charts. Otherwise there is no proof of your "succsess".   
BTW your "interest of quality" is pretty funny. Isn't this forum about learning and asking questions by traders who still need anwers? What makes you think that only experienced traders would be interested in your strategy? Do you measure one's trading experience in number of his/her posts?

If you don't know how to read the history file which has published here on board and you don't know how to transfer it at your own chart with the template and indis which are published here on board, too,... what sense would make the portal comment "interest of qualiy"? ,... and keep in mind, please that I'm not your secretary.

Instead of showing some pictures show your account history, unless you don't know how to do it. Drag and drop some trades from your account history on your charts if you're trying to show your results. See the picture of my trades that I attached the other day.  
"Misrepresentation"- I haven't used this word on this forum and don't know what you're talking about at this point.

H4 signalizes adequate possibilities for an upward movement.  
  
Daily could be running further down next week - if so then average down between 2 and 7 positions more -, nevertheless the market price seems for me good enough for an enter long.  
  
Set Enter Long between 1.037 and 1.0385 with 3 positions. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)  
  
Target: 1.0495 (MR1 1.0502) / 1.053 (DR1 1.05324) / 1.056 (MR2 1.0567)

Hi i just want to say this is a great system, it is just about the discipline of the trader. This system is not for those that like quick profit and works better on longer time frame like 1hr and 4hr. Thanks for introducing the Murreys MAths that is really something new to me, i usually just use sto and bollinger bands with candles signals for entry but as a new trader i often get impatient and take my profit too early.   
  
But i would like to ask do u bring your stop loss to your break even? if u do when do u place your stop loss at be?

Hi neurus  
  
In the "Market Tip" sections you'll find the main timeframe at the beginning of the comments.   
  
e.g. CADCHF, H4, see #[**55,**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3929941&postcount=55) or USDCHF, H1, see #[**15**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3928578&postcount=15)  
  
Before I take a trade I make my analysis of minimum 5 timeframes for every currency pair (two higher & two lower). When I make my trading decision at H4 I enter my trades at M5 or M15, if I don't set a pending order. Basically I like to trade at all time frames with a strong look at Risk/Reward-Ratio dependently at the used timeframe.

Please don't post untrue statements.  
According to this system Forexcube has taken 76 trades on 8/6/10 with an average profit of 3 pips.  
(screenshot below from his Trade History)  
  
This has nothing to do with longer time frames.  
  
As for stop-loss, he apparently does not place them.  
All his open trades are hidden, presumably with large losses in EUR/USD, that is why his equity is at 49%.   
  
Can we see your Open Trades so as to better understand your risk?

I'm very critical of this "system" only to protect people who cannot decipher fact from "fiction."  
  
It is dangerous because newcomers to FF can be deceived very easily.

Good Luck to everyone.

This system is not for those that like quick profit and works better on longer time frame like 1hr and 4hr. Thanks for introducing the Murreys MAths that is really something new to me, i usually just use sto and bollinger bands with candles signals for entry but as a new trader i often get impatient and take my profit too early.

Hi daemonw  
  
Many thanks!  
  
My SL concept is completely unorthodox. I don't trade often with stopp loss due to the fact that often I hedge some positions if they are running into the counterpart direction and wait for a counterbalancing at higher time frames. Market will change and time will come! I prefere to let the market his breath. Often I counterbalance trades at H4 with several intermediate trades at 30 sec., M1 and M5 only for a few pips, so when market turn I make money even so and let the big trade (H4) further running, due to the fact that I believe in my market analysis.  
  
Hi all  
  
Could anyone else give here an answer to daemonw, please. Where would you set your SL when trading the TCT-System?

Okay you have give us an argument that you don't have mathematical knowledge, may be concerning your resentments which you broadcast here on this board, may be for reasons other than....   
  
Could someone explain Intu how much money are really at this account, please? It could be when I make this calculation that Intu would misvalue it.   
  
Have anybody interest to show Intu the right mathematical calculation?  
  
How to find my history file?, see #[**48**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3929225&postcount=48), please.

My last post in your thread I promise...  
  
I have a B.A. in Mathematics, and I am very good at analyzing systems.  
  
I'll admit I am not a great trader (yet![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)).  
  
I have nothing against you personally, you seem to be a well educated man and I respect that.   
  
I only ask two questions...  
  
Why did you start a second username recently that has been banned?  
<http://www.forexfactory.com/member.php?u=145564>  
  
Will you show your Open Positions (on this demo account) so that we can compute your possibility of a margin call in the near future?

Could somebody explain Intu my history file, please & not only the last page at 8/6/10, moreover at a Friday day where disciplined traders don't trade long trades before weekend!

I have written Tweed months ago when they have pushed me in the commercial member side that I don't want to be there and I will go back, but no answer was returning. All my other published trading systems has been 4 or 5 stars since before the transfer into the commercial sector. Two weeks ago I have got my name Forexcube as "Member" back (not any more "commercial member under evaluation"). Till then I have written under trigg and at that time no comment more under forexcube and I have written a few letters to FF and have give him all my synonymes and my intention to go to the member thread back. OKAY! Right so, or something else, that you don't like ...  
  
Again: What's your really problem!

Then you can play fair and give all here a mathematical clear solution from #[**66**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3930243&postcount=66) , please.  
  
If an account has opened with 25'000.-$ (three weeks ago) and has now incl. open trades 443%. How much are then 49% net?

Sorry but I wouldn't respect a person who I have the intention to overrun with one critical aspect after the next & with many assumptions and not abating vague suppossitions! I would go away from this thread,...without do sb. harm!,,.. and would be on the qui vive for "better" FF threads environments instead of nailed up here any longer! Why not! Okay,..., may be it's a kind of character!... I don't know!...

This is your thread and I have no desire to harass or argue with you.  
  
You have over 1700 trades in three weeks with no losses.  
I argue that you hold the losing trades in your Open Positions never taking a loss.  
  
With your recent activity in EUR/USD and your current equity...  
  
I will wager that you have accumulated positions that will margin call the account with a 200 pip upward move in Euro based currencies.  
It could happen tomorrow or the next day easily.  
  

  
If you do in fact have large SHORT positions in Euro based currencies,  
you will discontinue this thread and not post in it again.  
  
Deal?  
  
Unlock the Open Positions and post it here within 15 minutes?

I don't have say that I haven't open positions in the loss. What's your unfair play know. If you have 49% in the wins from 443% of initial deposits of 25'000.-$ so it's a marvellous result & this moreover after three weeks of trading and you have to respect that and to respect that I trade my way and account in the win. If you show me that I don't have a win over 100% when I exit all my open position now then you have to give me 1'000-$ which I'll make a named donation and not the bauble of 3 months away from FF. You make me here ignoble,..., now accept responsibility & raise the stakes!.

What's your problem  
  
When I trade an account in the wins and I follow a Non-Stopp-Loss-Conception in my unorthodox way, why I should discontinue this marvellous thread with this great TCT-System if other interesting traders could also earn money, may be much or even more money with his Stop Loss Conceptions? Will your ego cut them all, now! What's your real intention! Are you employed by the brokers! Then I understand your contrastive rhetoric!,...or is it only a special kind of crazy thoughts walk, today?

[quote=Intu;3930291]My last post in your thread I promise...  
  
I have a B.A. in Mathematics, and I am very good at analyzing systems.  
  
I'll admit I am not a great trader (yet![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)).

Supposedly, math was Einstein's WORSE subject..he actually HATED it...and we all know the rest of the story! I can say that if I walked away from this thread RIGHT NOW...I benefited from it mainly because I'm very visual...and the cci/rsi has given me EXCELLENT opportunities when used with my fib-based system.....for what it's worth....keep up the Excellent Work you are presenting here...it's up to us to decipher the information..I am finding the system very intuitive for my purposes!

i am just a junior member but i just want to say, it is not like forex cube is here to con money away from us why so hostel. IF we dont trust the system just test it, it is not like he will be getting lots of money from us when u trade the time cell. Try it on the 1hr and 4 hr time frame it is a limit your losses and trail your profits kind of trading style.  
  
Just to share a bit too i go in 3 lots at entry too, 1 to tp at mid bollinger, 2nd one at the edge of the bollinger, the third one i usually just let it run

For interesting traders who like to test the TCT with real money, but not with much money, I have decided to make a demonstration with a real Account for several months. So I have take one of my experimental account which I will trade with the TCT-System for several months.  
  
Trading environments  
Maximum 10 Positions could be made per currency pair at the basis of 50 units, (or 5 x 100, or 2 x 250, may be 1 x 500). I prefere the 50 units when I trade with a 50.-$ Account with the exception, if probabilities seems to be extremely high for making a higher profit I take boundless freedom for increasing my own risk to a considerable degree, e.g. 10 x 100 units or several times 500 units instead of 10 x 50 units or so.  
  
So you can follow the results of this account if you want.

Thanks for posting your method. The Murrey Math lines have given me a valuable frame of reference to judge price action. This is very inspiring.

EURCHF, H4  
  
HiCl3ric  
  
It would be more respectful, if you make your charts by yourself. You have all information at p.1, #1. So for the next time I invite you to make one chart by yourself and post it here and you are able to discuss my market tip with other traders here on board. Why not! I'm not your secretair! I think I give many worthwhile directions here on board, but I demand more arrangements by the visitor.  
  
I won't give any TP limits sometimes. So it is an extra responsibility for a trader to go out of the market when he's/she's thinking... "it's all right now!"  
  
I let the market run and any time or one day or other I go out. I hate strictly rules and sometimes I trade only for lucky several pips.

I think you tallk about enter short (not entry enter long).  
For sure,...to a greater or lesser extent. Pivot D at 1.3867, MR2 at 1.38711 & Murrey Math "Overshoot" [+1/8] at 1.3870

Look at your chart (M30, H1, H4) and tell me some options or eventualities, please? Think at Pivot Points and murrey math lines, too. There are a lot of options. The main point is that you run your trade in the win!,...how much?,... seems for me really subsidiary...due to the fact you can open other trades with other currency pair with other probabilities, ..., forex market seems to be so superb, delightful infinite. Every trader has his own risk-reward-ratio...  
  
Discuss it with other traders here on board... we are all here...to look how our other friends here would, could or have to trade...

Entry was at 1.38557 with 4 x 50 units & 1 x 100 units, see #[**101**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3932430&postcount=101) ,please.  
  
I would set at 1.398 (R3 1.3942) and murrey math "Pivot Reverse" 1.4155 by trading the H4 chart and give the market it's breath. CCI(14) show a negative divergence so the likelihood is great for a movement downside.  
  
Generally I dont like stop loss I would hedge these positions at these points, due to the fact that long line (monthly chart) prices will going north.  
  
1,3890? 1,3915? could be too dangerous by trading H1. Short-term-breaks could be possible at the confusing Forex Market every time, moreover after the London close session.

May be it's better to wait at the next H4 peak or valley. Struggling around H4 EMA100 & in the middle field of the BB area.

& the daily chart & weekly, too could help you in this upward movement!..., also H1.  
  
may be...would go enter long with one or two little positions more, if M15/M30's peaks will changed into a valley.

AUDUSD Daily gives for me probabilities to stay at the sideline and wait till the market have decide which direction it will further go. The shooting star and the divergence are arguments for a downtrend at the daily. Weekly (see #[**135**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3936635&postcount=135), please) shows a peak and the monthly is reached near the resistance line like the candles before 2009.10 01, 2010.01.01, 2010.03.01, 2010.04.01. May be 0.92772 but if it will go further on?,...even better rather strong arguments for an alternative downside movement. So H4 EMA20 could be develop as a resistance line where market price still stay yet ( see #[**136**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3936653&postcount=136), please). So long as H1 doesn't break the EMA50/100 (the last five candles shows as well slightly down) I would be careful.

This is a very easy and simple system and I love it.  
Addressing your "Minus" points, one way to filter false signal out is by looking at the CCI window. It also has the RSI indicator. Taking a closer look at all the false signals in the yellow rectangles you can see that the RSI didn't close above or below the 100, -100 line. When it did, in agreement with the CCI, it gave a valid signal.

Range Trading till 107.50 or a daily trend channel?  
Take the risk over an enter long with 3 positions at 110.85  
  
May be M5 Trading should be favored with EMA10 and EMA20 and let the wins run if EMA lines (10/20) are running parallel.

Forexcube- I see you have started a new fxbook account, will you be handling stop losses differently on it? I've been charting your charts on it and amazed how you can squeeze pips out of a flat market.  
bcarbon- great insight, so obvious now that you point it out.

Hi Delage   
If an account has been redoubled, tripled or quadruplicated I make another open and close the win account. So I take risk money out of the forex jungle. The last was 25'000.-$ and has reached over 70'000.-$ net (only profit) or more within 3 weeks. Demos has often been offered for only 1 month. Now I put out 65'000.-$ and go on with 5'000.-$ so no "private" money is now at this Forex Account, only quota of profits.  
I have one open with 5'000.-$ yesterday and will make the same 250.-$ per day. May be 5% a day is too much,... maybe not...  
My Stop Loss concept could be the same. If the market go counterpart I will hedge these positions if it seems necessarily and wait of counterbalancing at a higher timeframe. I'm not a friend of Stop Loss and I let the losers run for a while if I have make a sufficient market analysis before. Why to give up your trades in a critical market phase when you have make a market analysis before, which you can trust?...Moreover minus trades could be counterbalanced with cross currency pairs and so on...

UJ H4 seems for me a good entry chance. The last three swings shows a divergence. Weekly chart shows murrey math between [-1/8] and [-2/8]. You could wait at the market close if a hammer is building.  
  
Enter Long at 85.30 with 3 positions.  
  
Further downside movements could be hedged at M5.  
  
And take a look how EURJPY and GBPJPY works. Monthly EURJPY signalizes upward movement,... may be till 117/118 in the next weeks, we don't know when,...but I bet a coin it'll coming...  
  
Target: 85.90 (R1 85.96) / 86.25 (MR2 86.30) / 86.50 (H4 EMA100 86.56)

I did look at H1 and M30 and their indicators are both going south. I would wait until they change directions to get a better entry signal.

Hi bcarbon,  
Prices are struggling aroung M30 EMA50 (, see #[**158**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3939600&postcount=158), please). If it would stay above it (EMA50) then an upward movement could have a better probability. EMA20 at H1 could just now change in a support line, second last H1 candle (red one) is coming down to it the candle yet just now is blue and goes up. If the market price won't have the force to run it down (it has to close under EMA20) and the next H1 candle doesn't then go upwards again, then it seems for me a downward movement could have been a greater likelihood,... and sure... e all opened enter long positions have to been hedged then.  
  
Surely waiting is less risky...no doubt! ...may be then you are not early enough in the trade, ...the old classic melodrama.  
  
USDJPY, H1, 2010 August 11  
  
May be it helps.

As you predicted, price has been struggling.   
I enter the trade on M1 signal after the H4 signal was issued. So far it has been in positive territory.

First trade today, a sell at 84.936. Entries are the checks, exit the X. I took this about the top of the trading channel with CCI at 100 and RSI at 75. PA continued up and took another sell at 84.983 with CCI at 200 and RSI at 100, much better position. In retrospect, I shouldn't have taken the first trade as it didn't meet my rules of a short at 200 and RSI at 100. The reason is because the trading channel at that time was bouncing between 84.90 and 84.95 with the CCI between 100 and -100. That's a very narrow channel and should be avoided by a beginner, although Forexcube does it frequently.Exit was at the bottom of the trading channel and CCI at -100. Lesson: Both were profitable but stick with higher probability trades, like the second.

Ouch! No fun here but a lesson. Shorts at 84.927 and 84.954 with CCI and RSI way up there should have been profitable and would have been if my trigger finger had been faster when CCI plunged to -150. This is a great illustration of sideways PA and positive divergence which will lead to an upupupwards PA. Lesson: Watch divergence, it's there for a reason.

I'm throwing this out for discussion - CCI and RSI were 100 points apart for a while, then PA snapped up. With RSI on top and that far apart, is that a leading indicator of a quick move up?

On the right where PA hits -2/8 extreme overshoot line, the CCI is only at -100 and RSI is a little below zero. I don't think with the CCI and RSI in those positions I would have taken the trade, they're not in a tradeable position. But look how the PA shot up. Earlier PA had gone down almost to -2/8 and CCI and RSI were in an excellent positions for a long, which would have done very well. But the second time PA shot farther, can't make sense of that.

Here is how I look at it. CCI and PA are showing a big divergence. That alone is a big signal, even if CCI is not quite yet at -100. PA is almost touching Extremely- overshot level. The two candles in question formed a double bottom and the blue candle has a bullish candle pattern. This candles are also touching the lower BB. As for RSI I favor when it either crosses or touches the 20 level. In this case, I cannot see that level marked in the chart, but at this point there are so many other signals giving a green light for a long position that it really doesn't matter.

i ve been trading murray math lines lately with profit. martingaling at extreme oversold and overbought levels. making profit. when one postion is a nice profit, my discretion i get out of position and reset a limit order. i use a very small % of account size just in case it really goes bad. thats the martingale.  
keep in mind that mm lines redraws at some point.  
nice thread.. gave more ammo with cci, divergence, etc  
thanks

Forexcube and bcarbon, Excellent point about divergence, I'll watch it closer. Same with candle patterns. Where did your fxbook page go? I like to chart your trades and learn from them.

May be that Alpari would delete this Demo Account account (Deposit 5'000.-$) without saying me anything, due to the fact that I haven't fill out all personal dates in his fields. So they let you trade and at one they go without warning and Alpari UK delete your account. With the first one (Deposit 25'000.-$ and in the win over 80'000.-$ which was sometimes over 250%-350% net plus within 3 weeks they have make it in this way. If they do it with this 5'000.-$ Demo account again I'll change the Demo Broker.  
  
This account was at the first side here around 455% plus within 5 weeks when they has delete it.  
[http://www.myfxbook.com/systems#?pt=...e=0&sb=19&st=2](http://www.myfxbook.com/systems#?pt=6&p=1&profitType=0&profitValue=0&ageType=0&ageValue=1&drawType=1&drawValue=30&systemType=0&tradingType=0&accountType=1&lastTraded=30&size=20&tradesType=0&sb=19&st=2)  
...here you have to look at the demo, not the real account. The link from myfxbook shows only the real accounts at first,...fill out the field "Account Type" > "Demo" and then "submit". Now it isn't there!  
  
see attachment:  
Equity 77'129.93 at 2010 August 09.  
...and what you see yesterday most of these open positions were running in the wins and had been closen by the TP's, say over 100'000.-$ cash on account. I don't know why Alpari is interested to block such accounts. May be that this art of trading style doesn't brokers like.

Hi mistersimple,  
  
you might well ask!  
  
At first I don't go often with one big order in the market (e.g. 2 lot) to a greater degree I divided it into small parts (e.g. 10 x 0.2 or 20 x 0.1). So I can go only with a part of it faster out (of the market) and let the others running furthur on.  
  
Second between the valley and the peaks or vice versa I make sometimes smaller trades in between.  
  
Third: I like time cell cycling, say if H4 shows me an uptrend I go with several positions in this up. Simultaneously I trade down e.g. if M5 and/or M15 moves down with the same currency. Why not making money in different time cells with the same currency pair?  
  
Fourth: If I trade e.g. M5 EURJPY I look at M5 GBPJPY and M5 USDJPY,... or look (other example) if I trade M5 EURJPY, to H4 USDJPY and H1 GBPJPY and like to trade (in this case now) positive correletated currencies but in counterpart direction, e.g. trade M5 EURJPY down and H4 USDJPY up. For the account it's better to counterbalance the risk.  
  
Fifth: It market shows greater probability I go in with several higher lots _sometimes_ but only for a few seconds or minutes.  
  
Sixth: Sometimes I trade only for making more winning trades and only with several pips not more (30sec., M1) & if there could be a main trend so at times I go several times in and out... and in and out... it gives me excellent feelings of being in the flow and could be a great power for the mental and physical presence, may be it's more a psychophysiological moment. I don't now,..., but I like it!  
  
Mistersimple, I think I should answer your question more detailed bit by bit in the future. If so then we should named this with a headline, so we and all here could talk about it in the future, if there should be a greater interest,...then may be under the topic: "Get-Add-up"? or "add-up-positions" or "position surfing"? and some of intersting readers would get clear what's talking about.  
  
We all have different add-up-position-strategy dependent at different basic parameter.  
  
May be I'll write an article (3-20 pages) some day and then it'll post here on board.  
  
How are you making this?  
  
Kindest regards  
FXCube

Alpari UK has disconnect this account, too. The same like #[**171**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3943041&postcount=171).  
  
Now I wil change the Demo Broker. Has anybody a good idea which one is good enough for tighter [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide")?  
  
The same again all my open trades would run in the wins now and they delete this demo account. Poor Alpari! Crap*y broker?  
  
The last equity was around 7'800.-$ sFr. till 8'500. $ and the with all open trades over 10'400.-$.  
  
What have I to do now got to Activetrades?, Open a second real account? ...  
  
  
I don't want fill out all these fields in a demo account, ...often I've got a lot of spam from everywhere then...if Alpari would give the data to everybody's next...? I don't know,...but his practice seems for me more and more doubtful...   
  
It would be nice when you can follow my trades at <http://twitter.com/triggFX> in the future, too.

What I mean is, if you say you got a wonderful set up in M15 then attach a pic of your set up. Just like Delage did a couple of posts ago. Delage not only posted pics of winning trades but also of lossing trades which in my opinion are more valuable than the winning pics. I learn more from a lossing trade than from a winning one. I like to analyse what went wrong; what mistakes I made; Did I follow the rules?, and so on. :nerd:

Oh yes, no problem, will made!  
I trade often without stop loss, so what I can make is when I hedge the "A"-positions when these first entries would running in a "loss trade" ("A"-position) and can show you that often (over 80%) also these trades ("A"-positions) could run in a win at a higher timeframe. Then we have to subsript these comments at board, so it's more easy to follow all follow-ups.

Thank's.  
  
See p.12, #[**175**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3943783&postcount=175), point 1 and point 6 please.   
  
This is conscious perception and simple mathematical calculation. If I trade 10 x 0.2 EURUSD and it will go extremely in a counterpart direction so I hedge e.g. with 4 x 0.5 or 2 x 1.0 lot or 20 x 0.2 and look at a higher timeframe when it's time to get with several of them out. This caluculation could be made for every currency pair. So I stay on the top of things. Moreover, most of them are shorter time frames, so risk coud be higher. Other open trade have in background the winning trade from yesterday or the day before, say if my target should be 250.-$ a day so I can trade with the rest of my profit with a higher risk and due to the fact that I trust my own market analysis. One more argument for me is that I let even more some lost trades run in the lost till the point where most of them will turn back and run in a win ( I think over 80% of all of them), ...but before that I have often hedged these position for a shorter time and several times. So I like to trade an unorthodox way, which give me win enough in a relative short time. I think it's more for advanced level trader who make more successul market analysis before they get into a trade. May be a beginner level trader will copy this concept and have success,...and is aware of the formula "( Equity > Used Margin ) = No Margin Call". So it's necessary to understand the mechanics of margin and how to use leverage. If so I hope he/she will post his/her marvellous results then here on the board, too.  
  
  
  
May be it's something more like that.  
  
Kindest regards  
FXcube

If your broker requires 2% margin, you have a leverage of 50:1. Here are the other popular leverage “flavors” most brokers offer:  
**Margin Required** **Maximum Leverage** 5% 20:1 3% 33:1 2% 50:1 1% 100:1 .5% 200:1 .25% 400:1  
  
**Margin required:** This is an easy one because I just talked about. It is the amount of money your brokers requires from you to open a position. It is expressed in percentages.  
**Account margin:** This is just another phrase for your trading bankroll. It’s the total amount of money you have in your trading account.   
**Used margin:** The amount of money that your broker has “locked up” to keep your current positions open. While this money is still yours, you can’t touch it until your broker gives it back to you either when you close your current positions or when you receive a margin call.   
**Usable margin:** This is the money in your account that is available to open new positions.   
**Margin call:** If the equity in the account drops below your used margin, a margin call will occur and some or all open positions will be closed by the dealing desk at the market price.

No matter what the [forex brokers](http://www.babypips.com/tools/forex-brokers-guide/meet.php) tell you, don’t ever open a “standard account” with just $2,000 or a “mini account” with $250. The number one reason new traders fail is not because they suck, but because they are undercapitalized from the start and don’t understand how leverage really works.   
Don’t set yourself up to fail.   
We recommend that you have at least have $100,000 of trading capital before opening a “standard account”, $10,000 for a “mini account”, or $1,000 for a “micro account”.   
So if you only have $60,000, open a “mini account. If you only have $8,000, open a “micro” account. If you only have $250, open a “demo account” and stick with it until you come up with the additional $750, then open a “micro account”.

It's necessary to understand when you trade in the conception of the add-up-positions...  
  
We’ve all seen or heard [online forex brokers](http://www.babypips.com/tools/forex-brokers-guide/meet.php) advertising how they offer 200:1 leverage or 400:1 leverage. I just want to be clear that what they are really talking about is the **maximum** leverage you can trade with. Remember this leverage ratio depends on the margin required by the broker. For example, if a 1% margin is required, you have 100:1 leverage.   
There is maximum leverage. And then there is your **true** leverage.  
True leverage is the full amount of your position divided by the amount of money deposited in your trading account.   
  
You deposit $10,000 in your trading account. You buy 1 standard 100K of EUR/USD at a rate of $1.0000. The full amount of your position is $100,000 and your account balance is $10,000. Your true leverage is 10:1 ($100,000 / $10,000)  
Let’s say you buy another standard lot of EUR/USD at the same price. The full amount of your position is now $200,000 and your account balance is still $10,000. Your true leverage is now 20:1 ($200,000 / $10,000)  
You’re feeling good so you buy three more standard lots of EUR/USD, again at the same rate. The full amount of your position is now $500,000 and your account balance is still $10,000. Your true leverage is now 50:1 ($500,000 / $10,000).  
Assume the broker requires 1% margin. If you do the math, your account balance and equity are both be $10,000, the Used Margin is $5,000, and the Usable Margin is $5,000. For one standard lot, each pip is worth $10.   
[http://www.babypips.com/school/image...leverage-1.gif](http://www.babypips.com/school/images/leverage/leverage-1.gif)  
In order to receive a [margin call](http://www.babypips.com/school/margin_call_example.html), price would have to move 100 pips ($5,000 Usable Margin divided by $50/pip).   
This would mean the price of EUR/USD would have to move from 1.0000 to .9900 – a price change of 1%.   
After the margin call, your account balance would be $5,000. You lost $5,000 or 50% and the price only moved 1%.

Here's a trade so stupid I hate to post it. Not only that, but it was in the middle of several great opportunities. Previously the CCI had poped up at 50 to gain a few pips so when it stared to do it again, I entered at buy at 110.057. Went up a bit and then down, I got out for a loss on demo account. I was looking at the M5 at the same time and saw the divergence but ignored it. I should have seen the divergence, sold at CCI 200, rode PA down to -300 or so (pivot, reverse) and taken a buy when PA and CCI started to move up for two big wins. Maybe this coming week.

Here's a loser from Thursday. At that time I didn't watch the higher time frames. The next day I concentrated on one currency on M1, M5 and M15(on a second monitor) and did a lot better. On the M1 I took a short at the red vertical line which quickly turned against me. If I had been watching the M5, I could have seen PA was in the middle of an upward movement and, not only was a pullback at that point probably a limited one, but that it would be better to take a position at the top or bottom of the PA and CCI channel. Lesson: Watch higher time frames.

USDCAD, Daily example shows a simple way of forex position trading. Deciding to venture into Forex could be a big decision and understanding the main principles of forex trading and the trading philosophy ensures the profit, which you as an investor or trader is looking for.  
  
The chart below shows a long position in which a trader purchases a currency pair at a certain price and hopes to sell it later at a higher price. In this case, the trader profits from an increase in price.  
  
This is also referred to as "buy low, sell high"  
  
In forex position trading, a trader has a long position on one currency of the pair and a short position on the other currency. So, while forex position trading, a trader defines his position as an expression of the first currency of the traded pair, which is known as the base currency. The second currency is known as the counter currency.  
  
In forex position trading, the trader takes a long position on a pair when he buys the base currency. If the trader sells the base currency, he shorts the pair.

Hi Delage  
  
Thank's for these charts and your trading examples.  
  
You can see the higher probabilities for the market entries here?  
May be in this kind you've got even more a profit with less risk.....  
  
What you see is that you have also a volatile M5 downward trend. EMA10 and EMA20 are running parallel. May be good time, too to trade beside the M5 the M1 only then when M5 candles are touching the upper EMA100 Line and M1 CCI(14) is showing a peak. It could be a higher risk to trade in an M5 downward trend the M1 upwards even CCI(14) will showing every time a valley, due to the fact that the main trend (here now M5) is going down. (Here you have to look at M15 & M30 too, please. If they are going up, then the likelihood a greater to trade M1 also upwards). I would suggest the M5 down and M1 up (or up and down) trading only for advanced level traders.  
  
Hope it helps!  
  
Keep it on!  
  
Kindest regards  
FXcube

0.99540 seems for me a good entry price.  
  
Could go down till S3 0.9914 (daily chart), weekly: 0.952 / 0.9277 / 0.8789  
  
H1 and H4 is building a valley.  
  
Enter long with several positions at 0.9954 and trade the hedge ones with M30/H1 for possible furhter downside movements.

When you say several positions what would be an approximate number to that statement?  
If you see that the price could go dawn more, then why don't wait until it is there to open your trades. To be honest, I have no experience at all with hedging and prefer to stay away from it.  
Changing subjects, I have been searching for an indicator that draw divergence lines between CCI and PA. So far I have found a divergence indicator for RSI and PA. If you set RSI to 5 it almost run contiguous to CCI 14 (not exactly but it is the best I have found so far). It would be wonderful addition to have in the charts and a less thing to watch for. I know we would   
have a good use for it, but still searching.

Trades could be made to maximum 10 positions. In this case I mean 3 positions.

H1 and H4 has building a CCI(14) valley, so I go in at H1 and H4 with enter long.  
  
Daily or weekly chart could lead you further downside. But at Time Cell Trading trades could be made at different time frames with the same currency pair.  
  
(May be M5 or M15 will show me a peak at CCI(14) and then I decide to go short for several positions at M5 and/or M15).

> Changing subjects, I have been searching for an indicator that draw divergence lines between CCI and PA. So far I have found a divergence indicator for RSI and PA. If you set RSI to 5 it almost run contiguous to CCI 14 (not exactly but it is the best I have found so far). It would be wonderful addition to have in the charts and a less thing to watch for. I know we would have a good use for it, but still searching.

Hi bcarbon  
It's pleasing, that you set RSI to 5, I've done it several years ago. Could you be so friendly and post a chart with it here at this thread, please, with your comments and explanation, so we all could follow your ideas, please?. Have you test it over all timeframes?  
  
Kindest regards

EURCHF, H4  
  
The last three H4 candles are indifferent.   
  
Market price seems for me a fair price for going north.   
  
H4 shows a regular positive divergence.  
  
My trades are Enter Long at 1.3335 just now with 3 position.   
  
Target: 1.3420 (1.344Pivot D) / 1.3480 (1.34902 R1) / 1.356 (1.35867 R2)  
  
\---  
  
The yellow circles indicates possible entries and exits at the H4 timeframe.

To be honest, since late last week I have spent most of my time searching for the right indicator rather than trading. There are thousands of indicators to try and very little time, so I cannot tell you how they work in different time frames because I have not tried them yet .  
However few months ago I used a very successful system in M5 that used RSI but it did stop to work for whatever reason.   
Nevertheless, here is the chart with some interesting RSI indicators. Not exactly what I want.

The green divergence lines on window 2 and PA are drawn by the indicator.

AUDCAD, H1 Trade Example & Add-Up positions  
  
Buy and sell when CCI(14) is at the extreme levels at the murrey math. lines.  
  
Preferred Trade: P1 (Enter Short), P2 (Exit)  
  
Trades in between times: P3 (Enter Long), P4 (Exit & Enter Short), P5 (Enter Short again), P2 (Exit all)  
  
Add-up positions  
If you would trade normally with 0.1 Lot so divide it by 10 and split 0.01 x 10, if you trade regularly with 1 Lot per trade so you should divide by 10 and partition 0.1 x 10. So the trades could often be made with a maximum of 10 incremental positions (IP's) of 1 Lot or 0.1 lot or whatever you pay for your average trade.   
Example: P1 enter short with 3 positions till P2 and exit here. P3 enter long with 2 positions and exit at P3. At P3 enter short with 2 positions again, P5 enter short with 2 positions once more,... and exit all positions at P2.  
  
Maximum incremental positions which has been used in this example: 7 IP's (incremental positions) in a downward market movement from P1 till P2.  
  
  
  
To the topic "Add-up positions", see also at p.12, #[**175**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3943783&postcount=175) ,please.

Hello Jean  
  
  
See attachment, please.  
  
I have change the code of this indicator:

like this:  
  
mml_clr[0] = MediumBlue; // [-2]/8  
mml_clr[1] = MediumBlue; // [-1]/8  
mml_clr[2] = MediumBlue; // [0]/8  
mml_clr[3] = MediumBlue; // [1]/8  
mml_clr[4] = MediumBlue; // [2]/8  
mml_clr[5] = MediumBlue; // [3]/8  
mml_clr[6] = MediumBlue; // [4]/8  
mml_clr[7] = MediumBlue; // [5]/8  
mml_clr[8] = MediumBlue; // [6]/8  
mml_clr[9] = MediumBlue; // [7]/8  
mml_clr[10] = MediumBlue; // [8]/8  
mml_clr[11] = MediumBlue; // [+1]/8  
mml_clr[12] = MediumBlue; // [+2]/8  
  
Hope it helps!  
  
Best wishes to Hobart!

I found a very nice CCI divergence indicator. It draws the lines on both CCI and PA, red for bearish divergence and green for bullish. It even gives an alarm when a divergence is detected not only a sound alarm but also a pop-up alarm.

Got into the first a bit early at 1.28600 with CCI at -200 and RSI at -75 and MM line 1/8. PA continued down so got out; I was a bit worried about the downward movement of the CCI on the M15, Thought there might be a trend change. Lose of - 17.7 pips. A few minutes later PA when to -1/8 and CCI and RSI were moving up so another buy at 1.28447, which I rode up until PA got soft and I got out for 24 pips. I noticed that sometimes PA will continue down after CCI hits bottom and then turns up, that happened here.

see e.g. [http://fxpath.com/2010/05/31/forextr...thdivergences/](http://fxpath.com/2010/05/31/forextradingwithdivergences/)  
  
  
Learn Forex ([FXpath.com](http://fxpath.com/)) – Price-oscillator divergences in the forex market are instances when there is a technical imbalance between the price movement on a currency pair and an oscillator’s movement. Divergences should not be considered complete, self-contained trading strategies. Rather, they should be regarded as signals that warn of some potential impending directional bias. As such, divergences are not standalone indicators – they should confirm or be confirmed by other technical indications.  
The oscillator that is used to identify divergences can be any of a number of different chart studies that can be found on any forex charting platform. These include: Stochastics, Relative Strength Index (RSI), Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD), MACD Histogram, Rate of Change (ROC), Momentum, Commodity Channel Index (CCI), Williams %R, or any other oscillator that travels between defined horizontal bounds.  
Once an oscillator is chosen, the process of searching for divergences is straightforward. There are two types of divergence that every technical forex trader should be aware of: regular divergence and hidden divergence.  
Regular divergence is the most popular type, and it is what most traders mean when they refer to the general concept of divergence. Regular divergence serves as an early potential signal that a loss of momentum and a potential price reversal may be in the making.  
The signal is manifested in an uptrend when price makes a higher high while the oscillator makes a lower high. This is called bearish regular divergence, and warns of a potential reversal and possible subsequent move to the downside. The opposite is called bullish regular divergence and occurs during downtrends. In a bullish divergence, price makes a lower low while the oscillator makes a higher low. In both cases, bearish and bullish, the oscillator diverges from price, giving an indication that price momentum in the currently prevailing direction may be waning.  
If either type of regular divergence is identified on a currency chart, forex traders should immediately seek confirmation of a potential reversal before taking any trading action. This confirmation can take many forms, and usually involves other technical indications like a trendline or moving average break, a reversal candle pattern, or some other chart reversal pattern.  
In contrast to regular divergence, the second type of divergence, called hidden divergence, can be considered the polar opposite. This signal is also a technical imbalance between price movement and oscillator movement. _But instead of signaling a potential reversal, hidden divergence is used primarily to signal a potential continuation in the prevailing trend._ As with regular divergence, there are also two basic manifestations of hidden divergence.  
Bearish hidden divergence usually occurs during a downtrend, and is characterized by price making a lower high while the oscillator makes a higher high. In this case, price and the oscillator are diverging in their signals, but the overriding signal that should be taken from an occurrence of bearish hidden divergence is a potential continuation of the lower highs in price, which is the equivalent of a potential continuation in the prevailing downtrend. Bullish hidden divergence usually occurs during an uptrend, and is characterized by price making a higher low while the oscillator makes a lower low. In this case, price and the oscillator are diverging in their signals, but the overriding signal that should be taken from an occurrence of bullish hidden divergence is a potential continuation of the higher lows in price, which is the equivalent of a potential continuation in the prevailing uptrend.  
As with regular divergence, confirmation should also be sought for instances of hidden divergence before any trades are actually placed. This confirmation can also take many forms, and usually involves other technical indications.  
Divergences are common and useful signals that are best utilized as warnings, or confirmations, of potential reversals (regular divergence) or potential trend continuations (hidden divergence).

I have noticed that it is better to use the CCI divergence indicator signals from M15 and up since lower tfs swings are not that big. However, this is my personal preference. Maybe you might like differently.

EURGBP, H4 Trade Example only with CCI(14)  
& Add-Up positions  
  
Buy and sell positions should be ordered when CCI(14) is at the peaks or at the valleys near the +200/-200 line.  
  
Add-up positions  
If you would trade normally with 0.1 Lot so divide it by 10 and split 0.01 x 10, if you trade regularly with 1 Lot per trade so you should divide by 10 and partition 0.1 x 10. So the trades could often be made with a maximum of 10 incremental positions (IP's) of 1 Lot or 0.1 lot or whatever you pay for your average trade.   
  
Preferred Trade: P1 (Enter Short) 2 IP, P2 (Enter Short / Divergence) 5 IP, P3 (Exit all 7 IP & Enter Long) 5 IP, P4 (Exit all 5 IP & Enter Short) 3 IP, P5 (Exit all 3 IP & Enter Long) 5 IP, P6 (Exit all 5 IP & Enter Short) 3 IP, P7 (Exit all 3 IP & Enter Long) 3 IP, P8 (Enter Long / Divergence) 5 IP, P9 (Exit) all 8 IP.  
  
To the topic "Add-up positions", see also at p.12, #[**175**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3943783&postcount=175) ,please.

Time Cell Trading means that trade could be made at Daily down whereas at the same time and with the same currency pair trades at lower timeframes (H5, H15, H1) could be executed in the ups.  
  
**T** CT in conjunction with the concept of the "**a** dd-**u** p-**p** ositions" (**TADUP**) gives you a chance of earning the money without a high risk.

Hello Froggy10  
  
Look at first only at the overshoot levels [-1/8 or -2/8 and +1/8 or +2/8] at M5, M15, M30 & H1 Timeframes, may be the H4, too and for an extremely long trend at daily, but at daily charts you have often to get out earlier.  
  
More important are the CCI(14) peaks & valley and in conjunction with murrey math, see example GBPJPY, H1 a powerful argument more for getting in or out of the trades.  
  
TCT gives you a lot of freedom how to trade. I like it like specified above. Sometimes I look only at the peaks, sometimes only at murrey math but often to both and if there are "pivots" and "divergences" or "hammers" or "shooting stars" and all these candles, which Steve Nison has described, support or resistance lines...all these are powerful arguments more for waiting any longer or go in the market soon.  
  
The main work of marketanalysis lies for me in the aspect of the multiple time frame analysis before I'll go in a trade. I have often to wait at higher time frames before I invest my money in the jungle of the Forex market. But there are a lot of currency in the forex market and sometimes I sit hours in front of the monitor and select some currencies with better probabilities of making a profit.  
  
CCI(14)/RSI(14) peaks & valleys has given me a great help since over 7 years now! I think if you can wait and have discipline it's so easy to earn money in this way.

Here's a good short on the GBP/USD, taken using the TCT method. On the M5 the CCI was at +275, RSI was at +150, PA was over -1/8 MM line. It made me a little nervous at first but PA has turned down very nicely. Forexcube would have taken several more shorts with those PA highs, I'm not that brave, yet.

Hello Delage  
  
Nice chart!  
  
This could have been my trades. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)  
  
If RSI cut CCI from down to up then market will show a higher probabilities, that it will turn up again. How long? We don't know. So I would take a look at M5 & M15, too, for getting the more global trend.  
  
Preferred Trades: P1 (Enter Short) with +3 IP's, P2 ( Enter Short) with +5 IP's, then Exit Point at EMA20 -5 IP's, due to the fact that M1 trading needs only several pips for profit taking, P3 (Exit) -3IP's.  
  
P1 could be a little more risky, so long as RSI is moving up and cut the CCI from below in an upward movement. May be I would go here in with only 1 IP or 2 IP's. It would be dependent what's going on at M5 and M15.  
  
"Attention at this point for a possible break upwards", if so then I would hedge all the open positions +8 IP's somewhere above that level and would try to counterballance the Hedge positions at the next higher time frames in the following days or if it is convenient to me.  
  
Your charts are excellent for learning all together.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
Keep it up!  
  
Kindest regards!

I'll be studying your comments about this trade closely - the point about the RSI turning up through the CCI is interesting, have to think about that. Here's what happened to the remainder of the trade; I left for 4 hours after setting SL at the entry and TP at the pivot reverse line. On returning, the PA had gone down but wasn't near TP, I let it run then PA dropped and I decided to close at the MS1 after it bounced up and down there. Entry at 1.5661 and exit at 1.5559 = 102 pips (3 lots = 306 pips) Not bad for a days work, for me.

Hello Delage  
  
Congratulation!  
  
It's a classical example how to make good profit. Overshoot level (murrey math) and enter short at a CCI peak and exit at a pivot point in a CCI valley. In this environment you have better probabilities for making a profit and so you can go in with several positions.  
  
Excellent work!![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
Kindest regards

USDCAD, M5, 2010 August 19 - Trade Example  
  
Preferred Trades: P1( Enter Short), P2 (Enter Short), then at DS1 1.0259 (Exit & Enter Long), P3 (Exit at mR1 1.0315) or P4 (Exit at DR1 1.0329).   
  
Add-up positions  
If you were went in with several positions (e.g. IP's 5) at DS1 1.0259 Enter long it's your option to go out at P3 with e.g. 3 IP's and let the other 2 IP's running further till P4. If market would turn south at P3 you could go out with the rest of 3 IP's and will earn even so a good profit.

USDCHFDaily, 2010 August 19 - Trade Example  
  
How to read false signals in a right way?  
The classical drama of market changements.  
  
False signals are generating all indicators in every trading system. Be aware when the market will change and move off in counterpart direction and switch through the time cells (Daily, H4, H1, M30,...).  
  
One way how to read the false signals at Time Cell Trading in a properly manner for a specified currency pair are published below.  
  
Normally P2 would generating an entry order Enter Long. When looking at the details of the daily chart, ...don't jump to the conclusion that it (the decision to enter long) could be right. Why? The last eleven daily candles before shows an indifference. The market isn't clear where to go. The EMA Lines 10 & 20 are beginning to fall down. RSI is falling down at the time intervall where the market are signalising the eleven indifferent candles. Excellent trades should be made at M15, M30, H1 for a range bound trading between murrey math "Ultimate Resistance" [+8/8] and "Weak, Stall & Reverse" [+7/8]. No problem, ...but do not trade at this market environment the Daily chart!   
  
After P2 you realize that the RSI and CCI Indicators are moving up,...whereas the EMA Lines 10 & 20 are moving down. RSI and CCI Indicators could give here false signals to the real market movements, due to the fact of its mathematical formula (arithmetical design). So it's better here (daily chart) to look primarily at the conformable EMA 10 and EMA20 lines and solve the problem by switching through the time cells (Daily, H4, H1, M30,...).

USDCHF, M5, 2010 August 19  
  
M5 shows a divergence. H1 is in an "extreme Overshoot" [-2/8] level. If the hammer (H1) will stay along so enter long again with several positions at H1, too.  
  
Enter Long at 1.02850/1.02950 with several positions.  
  
USDCHF, H1, see #[**264**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3961212&postcount=264)  
  
Daily/Weekly: Further downside movements possible since 1.0098 or lowest 2009.11.22 at 0.99137 and should be hedged at M15/M30.  
  
1.02850/1.02950 seems for me a good price.

On UCAD (5min) what was your thinking behind not taking profits/going short (SAR) at the two red boxes??:  
  
**1 First box** \- at BB and CCI OB 1.0272. Why not go short there (without hindsight)?   
  
The only reason I can think of is that it was just before U.S news due = caution. Othewise, we would have been killed on this trade. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1) Or maybe you were looking at the BB on the M30 and hourly too, which was higher.  
  
**2 Second box** \- at BB, and CCI OB, and at > DR1 by the time the 5min bar that hit DR1 closed (closed at 1.0363 way above DR1). 100 pips higher than first red box.  
  
Now we are at DR2 with CCI divergence at 1.0373, ie. **currently we are 40 pips ABOVE where that last red box ended.... about here where this text line ends....

Also, London close, so maybe day's move is exhausted, I would think factored in too (into your thinking too as to why it would be a good time to take a trade)?  
  
**Makes sense to take a counter move at price exhaustion at London close (ie. a long UCHF trade after a big trend down), just as it makes sense to avoid taking trades just before US news (re the UCAD above). Context matters for every sys. Good trade ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

see #[**262**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3961165&postcount=262), please.  
  
Yes, the M30/M15 one. For going down I don't have had enough arguments at M15.  
  
At the same time I have trade the M15 with several positions and here the upward movement was at the beginning whereas M5 has reached its highs. So I decided to go out with M5 not so early, more at these P3/P4 levels. mS1 1.0280 wasn't a real option for me due to the fact that M15 (see chart below, please) was running up in a good way till DR2, mR3 as we could seen later. M15 candle has forming a hammer at DS1 1.0259.  
  
Also possible to go out at mS1 1.0280 when trading the M5, pips should be enough (for a M5 trade) and a winning trade is been made. That's every traders freedom, to go out earlier or take the risk over and let the trade further run.

Taking profit at M5 at DR1 1.0363 is absolutely okay, and then when looking at the upwards drift at M15 (see chart below, please) there are no arguments for an enter short further more. Not so at DR2 1.037 (due to the fact that the next higher pivotal point was reached and a CCI peak) or mR3 1.0385 (here is M15 diverence). At both levels you can go with enter short in the market (if H1/H4 shouldn't told other things).   
  
Hope it helps!  
  
Keept it up!

CADJPY, H4, 2010 August 19  
  
Enter Long at 82.10 with 5 positions and hedge the positions if H4 support don't hold.  
  
Weekly could go further down till "overshoot" [-1/8 ] at 79.68 or "extreme overshoot" [-2/8 ] 78.125. Lowest was 2009.01.18 at 68.38.  
  
CADJPY delivers excellent visual aspects for trading the H1 and the H4, ...at H4 with its peaks and valleys whereas at H1 let your wins run if EMA10 and EMA20 would go well parallel.

How strong could be the arguments if you trade to the exclusion of CCI peaks & its valleys?  
  
Example:

Hi Ducke  
  
Closely monitored!![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
Absolutely correct!.  
  
That was my intention to give you this aspect of Non-Stop-Loss Trading with TCT.   
  
You might see in the future that 80-90 % of all opened positions will run in the wins. The first days since this account is opened was to earn money and now I can make investments at H4 and H1 more. When you see the examples above with CCI tops and bottoms then it's clear that you need more cash for the next winning trades, because it could run one or two waves in the counterpart direction (e.g. forming a divergence) and then you have to invest once more at the next CCI top or bottom level. See charts above, please. So 100-200 pips could go easily in the counterpart direction (at H4 level), but then market could often turn in your favor. Ergo: This kind of unorthodox trading needs 30-50% of your account capital for making a constant profit over time! My purpose is to trade predominantly with the profit money and not with the deposit money (5'000.-$). All opened positions are in an excellent position for making good profits. Sure! You'll see this in the future. And that's an unorthodox strategy which I intend to post here at this board, now! So it's extremely important to view this account result just now!...and how it will change in the future for understanding this unorthodox kind of strategy. You don't need copy this you can trade in your style and make money with TCT. I trade in this way and I want it post here for all interesting traders. The relation opened trades to history trades are near 1:10. When it'll get lesser then often the lotsizes will increases.  
  
The - 1'996.23$ is money which will run in the win! It's the breath of the market!  
  
Risk is a function of a trader not one of the market. Risk is controlled by position size and by the used strategy and so it's controlled exclusively by the trader!  
  
Hope it helps at first!  
  
Kindest regards  
FXcube

The first days since this account is opened was to earn money and now I can make investments at H4 and H1 more.

I was only able to demo trade 4 days this week, but ended up 110 pips, my best yet. I'm still doing a few dumb things but eliminating them one by one. After seeing posts 277, 280, 281 and 282, I'll start paying much closer attention to swing trades - very interesting. Also, I'll be watching the SGD/JPY with your advice in mind. Thanks!

These are open positions from 2010 August 21. A good deal of these ones (80-98%) will run into wins. Several times it could be hedged in this way. The following 4 pages will monitor the status quo of open trades at 2010 August 21. As will be seen in a few days or in several weeks the most part or all of these open positions would have transfer. The - 1'996.23$ is money which will run in the win! It's the breath of the market! Risk is a function of a trader not one of the market. Risk is controlled by position size and by the used strategy and so it's controlled exclusively by the trader!

Hi Cube,  
  
Excellent Strategy You have here,  
  
But It would be better if an EA added to it that would do the works for Hedging, Adding position , and Profit Taking... for Short Term Traders.

Hi FXcube,  
  
Thanks for the great thread. I've had an interest in the CCI indicator for a long time.  
  
When a security is trending I've found that CCI(14) will often go to +/-200 without reversing.  
  
Do you have any advice/filters for this?  
  
Regards,  
Wooli

Hello Wooli  
  
So long as EMA10 and EMA20 goes parallel (EMA10 don't intersect the EMA20) let the win run. You can try it with other EMA's (may be EMA5 EMA30 or so)and get a feeling what could be better for your intention. Or switch a time frame higher.  
  
see also p.1, #[**1**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3928224&postcount=1), please.  
"Also I have some simple exponential moving averages e.g. **EMA10 & EMA20 to give me clues on the strength of a trend **and the likelihood of mass traders entry, also an EMA 200 as a long term moving s/r. "  
  
  
See p.1, #[**4**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3928227&postcount=4) , please.  
"EURJPY, M15  
**As long as EMA lines 10, 20, (may be 50) are running side by side let your win run.**  
Focus at CCI (14) peaks and valleys in conjunction with Pivots and/or Murrey Math lines and/or EMA lines - the more the merrier."  
  
See also p.17, #[**252**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3958216&postcount=252) RSI is crossing the CCI(14) from down to up, so p.18, #[**270**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3962065&postcount=270) again  
  
Is at your chart an RSI(14) indicator? I don't think so.  
  
  
Kindest regards

Tip for advanced level traders  
When you trade the H4 in a strong uptrend you can trade the waves (down after and before the next upward movement) with M1/M5/M15. So let the big trade (at the higher time frame H4) run up and trade some severals intermidiate short time down. Candlesticks (e.g. Steve Nison) will help you!

Thanks FXcube,  
  
I may have worded my question badly.  
  
If you look at the attached 4H EURUSD chart it is in a strong bullish trend.  
  
I have placed arrows where the CCI breached +200.  
  
Would not the first three arrows have represented losing trades?  
  
Otherwise your draw-down would have been about 600 pips.

Hi Wooli  
  
It's better sometimes read the thread from the beginning and the comment at #[**299**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3967070&postcount=299) _**.**_ And it would be more respectful when you answer my question at #[**299**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3967070&postcount=299) even so. The question came up, I repeat it again: "Is at your chart an RSI(14) indicator? I don't think so." May be you do not bother to answer to my question. If so, then I don't understand your intention. Then I invite you to ask others your question here on board. May be they will spend time to answer your questions. All is explained. If you are not comfortabel with this trading system need other ones here at FF. It's full of plenty systems. Why to suspend at a trading system which you don't understand? One doesn't do that! You can go on with this "communication style "to put a wrong complexion on s.th.". If so then don't solicit my attention, please.   
  
Wooli you have 22 posts. Respect p.1, #1 the topic: "interest of quality" #[**1**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3928224&postcount=1), please.

Hi FXcube,  
  
I wish to assure you that I don't mean to be disrespectful to yourself or your thread.  
  
I have read all of your posts several times.  
  
You were right. The RSI I posted before was RSI(8) and not RSI(14).  
  
I've attached the same chart with the correct CCI, RSI and EMA's.  
  
After reading your post #299 again, am I right in assuming that you don't take a counter-trend trade when the EMA's are in alignment and parallel?  
  
Kindest Regards,  
Wooli

Hello Wooli  
  
That's right!.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1) See #[**4**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3928227&postcount=4), too, please. It's the same in a downward movement. Countertrend could be then only trade at smaller timeframes. If you need RSI(8) or (14) that isn't important, whatever which size you are more comfortable in your trading...try it with (4) or with (20), could be okay even so.   
See #[**302**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3967924&postcount=302) , #[**307**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3968645&postcount=307), #[**309**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3968732&postcount=309), please.  
  
You're wellcome!  
  
Kindest regards!

Hello Wooli  
  
See this chart here below, please. Hope it clearifies things a little more!  
  
Pivot Points or murrey math will often help you in your decisions!  
  
Preffered Trades: P1 (Enter Long), P2 (Exit & Enter Short), P3 (Enter Short), P4 (Exit & Enter Long), P5 (Enter Long), P6 (Exit)  
  
P2: After P2 there are 4 indifferent candles and then the bearish engulfing pattern. After this the 10EMA Line crosse the EMA20. You could go short at P2 quite well due to the fact that there was a murrey math at an extreme overshoot level [-2/8], see #[**309**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3968732&postcount=309), please.  
  
Before P1 there is a strong upward trend (see the parallel ascending EMA Lines).  
  
See #[**309**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3968732&postcount=309), please.

or like this...  
EURUSD, H4, 2010 August 23  
  
Preferred Trades: P3 (Enter Short), P4 (Exit & Enter Long), P5 (Enter Long), P6 (Exit & Enter Short), P7 (Exit)  
  
Don't trade at P1, P2. If you do trades here with Enter Short, so you'll earn a profit at P4 also but be aware you trade then counter the upward trend (look at the ascending paralle EMA lines and the RSI between high +50 and high +100)  
  
P3: Here murrey math "Extreme Overshoot" [-2/8)] 4 indifferent H4 candles and then the bearish engulfing pattern, after this EMA10 crosses EMA20 downwards. RSI goes down. All these might be very strong arguments for an entry short.

This had everything going for it, it was with the trend, it had broken above a descending trend line, on the M5 CCI was at 200, with RSI at 50 PA was at 5/8 sell premium zone (that's not shown on the image as the MM lines have shifted). Took sell on the GBP/JPY at 132.48 (check mark) , PA continued up, and took another sell at 132.59 (check mark), as PA hit the daily pivot and started down, with M5 CCI at 125, RSI at 75 and at 6/8 pivot reverse. PA continued down with a few bumps up until I decided it was time to exit at 132.10 (marked by X) with the DS1 and 0/8 ultimate support line with CCI being at -150. That proved to be a good decision, PA continued down then went up. 87 pips total, with 3 lots = 261 pips.

It's an excellent link for learning the _dIfFeReNt_ aspects of Trading Systems.  
  
You can choose between the "basic-", "simple-", "complexe-" and "advanced strategies".

This short on the USD/CAD is an experiment, I took it at 1.0507 at the 1/0 overshoot line and lots of negative divergence but M5 CCI was at -100, hoping PA would drop. It's gone sideways but I think it will drop, given the divergence. Lesson: best stick with classical trades.

While fundamental analysis can explain the forces at play in a bull or bear run, psychology will create the volatility. Fundamental analysis can't explain this. As John Maynard Keynes said: it is extremely dangerous to have a rational investment policy in an irrational world. Clear CCI is also a mathematical formula beyound that if traders used CCI they seems to know something by intuition and is doing so to bounce off waves. What is known is that technical analysis is the only way to measure the emotional component of the market. We know that many times an ounce of emotion can be worth a pound of facts. How else to explain the sudden shift in the market without a change in the fundamentals?  
  
_intuition_

It needs more time to find a trade with a greater or sufficient probability of profit taking. So I stay more at the sideline,...., may be today, may be this week and let my open trades run. May be I trade M1, M5 or M15, but market seems to be to consolidate before his next breakout.   
  
New trades are now with 0.4 or 0.04 or 1.0 Lot so that everybody could discriminate these trades from the old open trades before 2010 August 22 (with 0.02, 0.2, 0.05 lot - see the topic at p.20, #[**288**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3966089&postcount=288) , please. 0.5 lot size is free again now and could be further used).

My USD/CAD experiment in divergence didn't work well with a slow increase in PA, I decided to exit with a loss of 26 pips ( 26 X 3 = -78 pips).

USDCAD, Daily, 2010 August 24 - Trade Example  
  
Preferred Trades: P1 (Enter Long), P2 (Enter Long), P3 (Exit & Enter Short), P4 (Enter Short), P5 (Exit & Enter Long), P6 (Exit & Enter Short), P7 (Exit & Enter Long), P8 ? (Exit).  
  
Trade the range between 1.0165 - 1.642 and be aware of breakouts at the top and the bottom of the range band.  
  
\- P7 candle shows a hammer at the bottom range band.  
\- Daily divergence 1 and divergence2 is a powerful argument for an market entry.

see #[**320**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3970451&postcount=320), please.  
  
Hi Delage  
  
May be it's not the best time to trade M5 down when daily goes up to the top of the range band this week, see #[**321**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3970527&postcount=321), please. You make more profit when you consider the murrey math. Why not take long at Pivot DS1 and let the win run as long as ascending EMA10/20 goes parallel?,..with the Exit at e.g. next EMA10/20 down crossover or at the "Extreme Overshoot" [+2/8] murrey math?  
  
Not the best time to go in a trade when the EMA lines run horizontal without any vola.  
  
Why not go in a trade when the DS1 at 1.0465 was broken upwards? Risk:Reward was even better at DS1 with an Enter long?.  
  
Would be better to give this trade a miss!:nerd:,..., and the trading time? 18:30 after London close... most traders go away at this time!,...and the validity or significance of divergence after london close without any volatility?,... be careful!,...watch out!  
  
Keep it up!

May be someone will make the exact calculation for all open trades for Intu, ...  
  
Could this account go over 500 pips over 1'000.- pips over 2'000 pips in the counterpart direction without any margin call?

Certainly, with little leverage is unlikely that the account reaches the Margin Call.  
Unable to shake things were not looking good on the account. Many operations and little real gain. The last four operations are not allowed to see if the account would recover or not, as you predicted.  
I see no reason why you have to offend any Member of the thread, however his opinion is wrong.  
  
Sincerely,

Unfortunately, I cannot prove that I am correct, as ForexCube has now deleted the MyFxbook.com account (see below).  
  
+70 positions were closed at 12:00 GMT last night, I did not screen shot that. Unless ForexCube suddenly changed his money management strategy, it was a margin call. (Yes, they even do it on demo accounts).  
  
**This account is now deleted with EVERY other MyFxbook.com account _ever _mentioned in his TraCop1% and his Scalping 10sec, 30sec, 1 min threads. **  
  
When you claim that you have been trading this "system" for 6 years,  
  
"TCT is a manual trading strategy. Trades could be triggered within different time frames and can used in ranging and in trending markets. TCT has used since 2004." - from post #1.  
  
...I am going to examine your results thoroughly. All of the accounts have been margined called, that is why they are not displayed any longer.  
  
I have no ill will for ForexCube personally, but I would like to maintain the integrity of the forums.  
His strategy appears to be nothing other than not closing losing trades until they "bounce" back, while "pumping" up the account with many small gains which could be randomly picked and have nothing to do with the "strategy" presented.

EURJPY Daily, 2010 August 25  
  
Daily & monthly (see #[**359**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3975180&postcount=359)) are showing a divergence.   
  
Preferre to trade the range 106.50 - 112.50/114.00 long term & will added some trades at M5/M15 here and there.  
  
106.85 seems for me a fair price to take the risk over: enter long with 5 positions again.  
  
If price limit will be broken further downwards trade the downs with M5/M15 at hedging style (e.g. S1 105.18).

May be someone here will make a market analysis at EURNOK or CADJPY.  
  
May be to begin with monthly, then weekly, then daily analysis and where to set a market entry e.g. at H4, H1 for preffering a long term trade   
  
...and where at M5/M15 in a short term trade with regard at H1/H4.  
  
Would someone make experience,...?   
  
...or with other currency pairs?  
  
Yes, we can?

Alpari keep closing down my new demo accounts (which was opened yesterday at 2'500.- $ deposits and in the win with 4'800.-$),..., and it had the same thing keep happening to me until I filled in real information in the demo registration screen, including a real email. Solid ever since.  
  
  
New Demo Broker  
  
I have changed now at FXDD:  
  
Beginning Date: 2010 August 25 - (HR 1)  
Deposit: 20'000.-$   
  
This account will be guide with extremely high risk. So drawdowns could be made over 50% to Total Loss.   
  
Target is 4:1, say 3 accounts could be running in a win between 100-300% and the fourth one will suffer a total loss.  
  
It's really completely different as you make more conservative MM statements.  
  
Look at all the open positions, the pending orders and the History File

ForexCube,  
  
A DIBs-type system might suit you (inside bar breakouts). This way an account can't get killed when a range becomes a trend, AND vice versa.   
  
Maybe somewhat like Larry Connor's NR7 bars (find the narrowest range bar in last 7, and trade the breakout of the NR bar), ie. volatility contraction and expansion.  
  
Your various systems all seem to be based on picking tops and bottoms (with MTF CCI, Bollinger bands, pivots, Murrey Math, etc., as filters). Maybe try doing the opposite: find a narrow range (a NR bar or inside bar), and trade the range break.   
  
The key point is no tops and bottoms. That seems to be the achilles heel here. My 2 cents only. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

Hi bit9ret   
  
Your ideas are excellent and will give the TCT strategy a special effect. Will work it out in the next days. If you have some charts yet upload some/many of these here, please.

I've gotta go, but here are inside bars marked. GU is noisy but this is quite clear here....Breakout/close out of the inside bars.  
  
Go with the expansion of volatility = the close out the range = inside bar. (It's just a **coincidence** that they are top and bottoms here or are reverting inwards).   
  
Just stay away from mathematical** indis like CCI, BB etc. (OB/OS, even MTF OB/OS, becomes even more OB/OS = mega trend = account blow up when one fades it) and go for "indis" that mark price bars.   
  
**Mathematical indis process a series of prices and assume serial/self correlation, whereas PA is discontinuous, ie. anything can happen.

Things that are rare tend to be the most valuable. This is the way that breakout traders should approach the currency market. I like to look at breakout trading from a volatility perspective because the central idea behind breakouts is that periods of low volatility are followed by periods of high volatility. Sounds complicated? It isn't.  
**_What is the Definition of a Breakout?_**  
According to the American Heritage Dictionary, a breakout is defined as a forceful emergence from a restrictive condition.  
**_How Does it Apply to Trading?_**  
In trading, a breakout is a situation where a currency is caught within a tight range that has a clearly defined support and resistance level. When the support or resistance point is broken, a breakout occurs because the currency pair forcefully emerges from its restrictive price range.   
The following chart of the EUR/USD is a simple example of a breakout. In October 2007, the EUR/USD was trapped within a 200 point trading range for at least a week with a clearly defined support and resistance level. When the resistance level was broken, the EUR/USD emerged from its range bound environment and proceeded to rally 400 pips with virtually little retracement.

Source: eSignal  
Unfortunately finding breakouts on the charts is easy, but trying to time a breakout is hard. This is where the Inside Day Strategy that I teach in my book Day Trading the Currency and advisory service BKTraderFX comes into play. This strategy is actually very popular in the world of professional trading, but new traders are frequently amazed by its ease and reliability. Currencies are extremely trending which increases the accuracy of Inside Days. Like pink diamonds, Inside Days are extremely rare, but when they manifest themselves, the signal is very powerful. In order to spot inside days, nothing more is needed than basic candlestick charts.   
**_What are Inside Days?_**  
An inside day is defined as a day where the daily trading range of a currency pair is contained within the prior day's trading range. In other words, the day's high and low do not exceed the previous day's high and low as indicated by the following candlesticks:   
[http://images.tradingmarkets.com/200...p020508-12.gif](http://images.tradingmarkets.com/2008/JP/jp020508-12.gif)  
Inside days represent decreasing volatility because each day's range is smaller than the next.   
With the inside day trading strategy, we need to see at least two inside days because seeing just one is simply not significant enough. The more inside days the better because it increases the likelihood that the breakout will have follow through. The inside day trading strategy is best applied on daily charts because the longer the time frame, the more significant the breakout. The following candles illustrate what two inside days look like (the candles can be red or green):  
[http://images.tradingmarkets.com/200...p020508-13.gif](http://images.tradingmarkets.com/2008/JP/jp020508-13.gif)  
**_Rules for the Inside Day Trading Strategy_**  
Here are the rules or general guidelines that I like to use for trading Inside Days:   
Long:  
1\. Identify a currency pair where the daily range has been contained within the prior day's range for at least two days (we are looking for multiple inside days).  
2\. Buy above the high of the most recent inside day.  
3\. Place stop and reverse order at least 10 pips below the low of the nearest inside day.  
4\. If the position moves higher by the amount that you risked sell half of the position and replace the stop and reverse with a trailing stop.   
Protect Against False Breakouts: If the stop and reverse order is triggered, place a stop at least 10 pips below the low of the nearest inside day and protect any profits larger than what you risked with a trailing stop.   
The rules are the reverse for a short trade if the breakout occurs to the downside.   
**_Deconstructing the Trading Rules_**  
No one likes to follow rules without understanding them and I am big believer of understanding the premise behind each rule in my strategies so that traders realize which ones are flexible and which ones aren't.   
Rule # 1 is the core of the strategy. We MUST see at least two inside days in order for the setup to be valid. If there is only one inside day, the strategy should not be considered.   
Rule # 2 is the action that puts us into the position. We want to buy at the first sign that the range is expanding or that the volatility is increasing. Therefore we buy as soon as the price breaks above the high of the closest inside day candle. More conservative traders who want to make sure that the breakout is real can buy when the price breaks above the inside day candle one day before the most recent one, but buying then will also increase the amount of pips at risk.  
Rule # 3 has two purposes. The first is to act your stop, the second is to prevent against false breakouts. Every trade needs a stop and our stop on a long trade is placed 10 pips below the low of the most recent inside day because I believe in technical stops over monetary stops. The idea is that if we are in a long trade and the currency breaks below the low of the most recent inside day, then the prior breakout is false and no longer valid. However, given the significance of an inside day breakout, we actually add an order to short when the long position is closed so that we can capitalize on a breakout to the downside.   
Rule #4 is the most flexible. Here, we exit half of the position for nothing other than a monetary reason. Then we move our stop to breakeven on the second lot and trail our stop so that we can capture as much of the breakout moves as possible. Aggressive traders may choose to trail by a 1 bar low while conservative ones choose to trail by a 3 or 5 bar low or a technical indicator.  
Now let us take a look at an example:  
In the same EUR/USD chart shown above, we actually see our two inside days in the area highlighted. According to our trading rules, we go long the EUR/USD when it breaks the high of the most recent inside day at 1.4280. Our initial stop and reverse order is placed at the low of the closest inside day minus 10 pips or 1.4179. This means that we are risking 101 pips. Therefore our initial target is the amount risked or 1.4381, which was triggered the very next day. Then we moved our stop on the remaining half of the position to breakeven. We trail the stop by a 2 bar low, meaning that we only exit the position when the price of the currency pair has broken below the low of the past two days. This happens 12 days after we put on the initial trade and we end up closing the second half of our position at 1.4554 for a profit of 101 pips on the first lot and 274 pips on the second.

**_Key Points to Remember_**  
The Inside Day trading strategy works best on Daily charts and currency pairs that are very trending such as the EURUSD, USDJPY, and GBPUSD. For further optimization, technical formations can be used in conjunction to the visual identification to place a higher weight on a specific direction of the breakout. For example, if the inside days are building and contracting towards the top of a recent range such as a bullish ascending triangle formation, the breakout has a higher likelihood of occurring to the upside. The opposite scenario is also true, if inside days are building and contracting towards the bottom of a recent range and we begin to see a bearish descending triangle is in formation, the breakout has a higher likelihood of occurring to the downside.

**Trading the Inside Bar Strategy in Forex**  
  
  
Posted on April 14th, 2009  
**Inside Bar Forex Trading Entry**  
  
This article will discuss the Inside bar trading strategy , a trading method I have used successfully for most of my trading career. My trading involves all methods pertaining to price action, they are not used in conjunction with indicators or other systems. I use a plain vanilla price charts tp look for the inside bar and other patterns as they form naturally on 240 minute and daily price charts.  
**What is an inside bar ?**  
An inside bar is a bar or series of bars which is/are completely within the range of the preceding bar, or , i.e. it has a higher low and lower high than the bar immediately before it (some traders use a more lenient definition of inside bars to include equal bars). On a smaller time frame it will look like a triangle.  
**What Does it mean?  
**An inside bar indicates a time of indecision or consolidation. Inside bars often occur at tops and bottoms, in continuation flags, and at key decision points like major support/resistance levels and consolidation breakouts. They often provide a low-risk place to enter a trade or a logical exit point.  
**When to use the signal**  
The most logical time to use an inside bar is when a strong trend is in progress or the market has clearly been moving in one direction and then decides to pause for a short time. If we play the break out, our stop loss can be defined by placing it below the half way point of the outside bar or mother candle, or for the more conservative trader, below the outside bar itself. This would mean that the market muse break a 3 bar low to take us out of the trade.  
These inside bars are very good when trading a trend on the 240 minute charts and the daily charts.  
**Special Notes**  
More advanced traders may also identify market turning points when trading against the trend, but this wil take plenty of screen time to learn, so its not suggested for novice traders.  
The Inside bar forex strategie is a flashing light, a major signal to the trader that reversal or continuation is about to occur.  
See the example below for a classic inside bar break out, and a classic inside bar stall pattern.

**My Price Action Setups: Pin Bars, Fakey’s, Inside Bars**  
  
  
Posted on January 17th, 2010  

**My 3 core Price Action Setups: Pin Bar, Fakey, Inside Bar**

**Pin Bar Setup:**  
The pin bar is a staple of the way I trade the forex market. It has a very high accuracy rate in trending markets and especially when occurring at a confluent level. Pin bars occurring at important support and resistance levels are generally very accurate setups. Pin bars can be taken counter trend as well, as long as they are very well defined and protrude significantly from the surrounding price bars; indicating a strong rejection has occurred. In the following chart example we will take a look at pin bars occurring with the context of a trending market, my favorite way to trade them. Notice how each pin bar resulted in movement that met or exceeded the next logical resistance point, marked on the chart as “target”  
Pin bars occurring within the context of a trending market on the GBP/JPY daily chart:  
[http://learntotradethemarket.com/wp-...ads/gbpjpy.gif](http://learntotradethemarket.com/wp-content/uploads/gbpjpy.gif)  
**Fakey Setup:**  
The fakey setup is another bread and butter price action setup. It indicates rejection of an important level within the market. The forex market is designed to fake traders out, as often times the market will appear to be headed one direction and then reverse, sucking all the amateurs in as the professionals push price back in the opposite direction. The fakey setup can set off some pretty big moves in the forex market. The chart we will look at below shows a fakey that occurred in the EUR/USD market that set off a huge down ward movement.  
Nice fakey setup that occurred at a major turning point on EUR/USD daily:  
[http://learntotradethemarket.com/wp-...ds/eurusd3.gif](http://learntotradethemarket.com/wp-content/uploads/eurusd3.gif)  
  
  
  
  
  
**Inside Bar Setup:**  
The inside bar is a great trend – continuation signal. It shows a brief consolidation and then a break out in the dominant trend direction. Inside bars are best played on daily and weekly charts. They allow for very small risks and yet very large rewards. The inside bar combined with a very strongly trending market is one of my favorite price action setups. We can see in the chart below an inside bar that formed on daily USD/JPY after a strong pin bar signal changed trend direction. This inside bar occurred at a 50% retrace level as well as a support level, whenever we get price action at a confluent level like this it is viewed as a very strong setup.  
Inside bar setup on daily USD/JPY:

EURJPY, M15, 2010 August 25  
  
Trading Example  
with CCI(14) indicator and the price action  
(Inside Bars or/and Engulfing pattern)  
  
Preferred Trades: P1(Short), P2(Short), P3(Exit & Long), P4(Short), P5(Exit & Long), P6(Short), P7(Short), P8(Exit & Long), P(9) ?, P10(Short)  
  
P9: Normally when trading only with CCI(14) it's a Short. The following inside bars couldn't give the confirmation, so I would it let short and go with the second inside bar long (hedging position) till P10. P10 is Exit and Short and I have to wait with one open position Short at P9 if the price will falling under the P9 line.

GBPCHF, Daily, 2010 August 26  
  
Weekly Candle is near the bottom of BB, Monthly shows indifference (market price seems here at the bottom of the last candle, too).  
H4 could go a little further down. If 1.5826 don't be broken downwards hold the trade, otherwise hedge these positions, ...or 1.5850 could then in an upward movement the next favorite entry point for enter long with additional 3 positions. If so then there would be 5 positions in the market at last.  
  
(Positions size per trade min. 1 - max. 10).  
  
Enter Long at 1.5930 with 2 positions  
  
Target: 1.6250 / 1.6650  
_  
...and after you have trade the enter long,...would you make a brit bus tour?_

Time Cell Trading means that you can trade the same currency pair at different timeframe at the same time. If you are interested in maximizing your profits it is important that you trade the smaller timeframes in the main trend of the bigger ones.  
  
Make your exercices how much you earn net, if you trade all signals at M15, H1, H4 and daily at an time interval, say over 4 weeks only with the CCI(14) tops and bottoms. May be someone can write an expert advisor. I don't know.

How do I figure this out: you say, on the EUR/JPY, the daily trade long, the H4 to trade short and the H1 to trade long. I'm not too worried about the H1, the H4 will override it but when will I know when to exit according to the daily? When will PA go long? I have 3 shorts on now and been watching the different time frames and can't make sense of it. Sometimes they drop, other times jump up and I think it's a trend change but then they drop back down.

Hello Delage  
  
Go out at each time frame with your specific positions when CCI(14) has reached the other side of the CCI tops or bottoms.  
To consider the pro's and con's I would overstate the bigger trend and if there nothing around tend to trade all timeframes inclusive M5 and M15. If you have now only shorts be aware that the bigger chart (daily) is showing up. So it could be dangerous to get in the market with more down positions as ups. Moreover since several weeks EURJPY is going the range 106.50/107-113/114. If there isn't a breakout probabilities seems higher for trading the range any longer. The market is giving ambigous signals at the time. That is okay! ...if you take a look at EURUSD, and other currencies,.., it seems most of the currencies at the forexmarket are now anywhere in the middle (the most of them have left its extreme points), ...so the market don't know where to go, why not? Market at EURJPY could also go till 92.6 - 89.25 (monthly chart). Time Cell Trading take account of this. You could go out at every single time frame apart! You can use CCI(14) & Inside Bars or other price action parameters. Most of the time the CCI(14) + Inside bars seems to give a valid and reliable information.  
  
Hope it helps!  
Kindest regards  
FXcube

EURUSD, H4, 2010 August 27  
  
H4 divergence and an inside bar might be good arguments for an enter short.  
Take the risk with:  
  
Enter Short at 1.2710 with 3 positions  
  
Target: 1.2655 / 1.2610 / 1.2545   
  
...or all positions at the next CCI(14) bottom

Thanks for the advice. I was wondering about holding it long term, maybe several days but I don't like to sleep on open positions ( I take demo trading very seriously). I've decided that I'm probably best suited to take the CCI highs and lows on the M15. Here's the trade, I took sells at 107.501, 107.634 and 107.611 and there were a few other places I could have entered also. Finally decided to exit at 107.278 for 76 pips.

> Thanks for the advice. I was wondering about holding it long term, maybe several days but I don't like to sleep on open positions ( I take demo trading very seriously). I've decided that I'm probably best suited to take the CCI highs and lows on the M15. Here's the trade, I took sells at 107.501, 107.634 and 107.611 and there were a few other places I could have entered also. Finally decided to exit at 107.278 for 76 pips.

Keep it on!  
  
At the moment my demo account at <http://twitter.com/triggFX> or <http://www.myfxbook.com/members/triggFX> is high risk to provide evidence of sheer insanity. Every 6 months I need this. It has nothing to do with any knowledge of riskmanagement. Pure coincidence! It's something like to goof around with demo account besides your real ones, which you have managed with strong discipline.  
  
Better to trade with a 10'000.-$ or 100'000.-$ Account at 0.01/0.1 lot and make per currency pair 1-10 positions. Here you have with TCT a balanced growth.  
  
Kindest regards

I vote in favor of the realistic, low risk account. I'm going to chart your trades on the FXDD account, your lower risk account, but it seems to me that opening 23 lots on a $100,000 account is very risky.

Knowledgeable!  
  
That's right, the more so as Friday, no matter how short the positions (45 - 60 min.) have been kept open! May be with several 0.1 of it (not 1.0 lot). Let there be no more of this!

NZDUSD, Monthly. 2010 August 29  
  
Monthly Candles are forming lower highs and lower lows and seems to go slightly downwards.  
Trading the monthly downward channel could be an option when you take the risk over with the actual daily regular positive divergence, see #[**403**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3985327&postcount=403). So breakout at the top green and blue lines could be very strong if it would happened. So trading the main trend down and the little ups with M15/30, ...that might for me a favorite trading design for the next days (may be weeks) with NZDUSD.

If I am interested in measure up the probabilities for better market entries so I have to work out a market analysis at different time frames. Time Cell Trading is given the market it's breath at the different time levels. When EMA Lines are beginning to run parallel parallel it is a sign that the market will loose his volatility and changing his trending movements (parallel up-/or downwards) into a range one.  
  
For getting a more global view it is a must to look at higher time frames (Weekly and Monthly).

see p.26, #[**384**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3979062&postcount=384)   
  
H1 CCI(14) from 2010 August 26 has reached its Top at 109.37 at 2010 August 30 (4:00 GMT+1) at murrey math "Ultiumate resistance" [8/8] and at Pivot R1 109.35 (P5).  
  
You could go out at mR1 108.76 (P4) but EMA Lines are running strong upwards parallel. The second peak H1 has then forming a divergence (Distance between 4th circle at CCI(14) (mR1 108.76)(P4) and murrey math "Ultimate resistance" [8/8] (P5).  
  
P1 at this chart below is P5 at #384.  
  
Profit: +200 pips  
  
Personally I see the use to let the market its breath, so you give also all others fellow-men traders his respect if there are in line with you or not. Moreover, we don't know where the market will go. What we have are some useful and hopefully simple indicators and/or parameters which could give us some higher probabilities for making a profit in the forex market.   
  
(Trades are open H4 down, p.26, #[**383**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3979017&postcount=383) and Daily up, p.26 #[**382**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3979011&postcount=382)) .

Be aware that there will be periodic recurrence where big capital players will con money out of your accounts. Charts are full of these sudden uncontrolled irrational moves at every time frame level.

I'm all for it. Why hasn't this thread drawn more interest? It is an easy high probability system that anyone can do. Very odd.

So then myfxbook, too. Myfxbook would only make a link at FXDD and fetch all data from there (FXDD). Howsoever the link has made.  
Twitter added all trade pips from all this account: 100'000.-$ normal risk account (025% per day). This one could followed at myfxbook.com

Currency markets are particularly well known for long-term trends, which are in turn caused by long-term macro-economic trends, such as interest rate tightening or easing cycles. But even in currency markets, historical analysis reveals that trending periods only account for about 1/3 of price action over time, meaning that about two-thirds of the time there is no trend to catch.

More than 80 percent of currency trading volume is speculative in nature and, as a result, the market frequently overshoots and then corrects.

AUDCAD, H4, 2010 September 01  
  
As trading occurs on currency comparison, it is easy to trade AUD/CAD in any economic environment. As both countries are major commodity exporters, both currencies are influenced by commodity prices, with the CAD specifically affected by oil prices.  
  
One Australian dollar is exchanged for 0.959 Canadian dollar (0.959 cents) today.  
  
AUDCAD H4 has reached a CCI(14) Top. So daily, too.   
A divergence has forming since 2010.08.27  
DR3 at 0.9605  
It seems to be an acceptable probabilitiy for a market entry just now.  
  
May be the forex rate will increased till 0.9912 (High at 2009.11.01) and would reflect a strengthening Australien dollar as compared with the Canadian dolar further more. If you think like this, so you should buy, if you expected that the Australian dollar would continue to strengthen against the Canadian dollar. I prefere to take at this level then one enter short (with 2 positions) once more.  
  
Enter Short at 0.959 with 3 positions.

This kind of general rule would be used more often then not.  
  
One Trade per currency are worth 10 positions. Every currency pair trade could allocated accurate to a tenth. So if a trade is normally 2 Lot it has been devided by 10. 10 x 0.2 Lot. If a trade could be 1 Lot it could also split in 10 x 0.1 or 5 x 0.2, or 2 x 0.5, ...and so on.

Carefully consider the strategy you are going to employ. Be wary of daytrading systems that encourage you to trade often and at all hours. This is rarely conducive to long-term success. Analyze your schedule. When does your regular life leave some spare time to spend in the market? If spare time is at a premium, Time Cell Trading long-term/investing will likely suit you best, due to the fact it requires less moment to moment attention. Find your time cells that suits your life and lifestyle - not the other way!

Market Tip  
  
In Forex we don't have the burdon of financial statements by itself. However, we can still analyze a currency's condition (strength or weakness) based on a number of factors. Combined, these give us a better indication of a particular trade's worthiness. If you insist upon predicting future movement (and I wish you wouldn't), you should be familiar with a minimum: > The currency's behavioral characteristics, say how much does it move (hourly?, daily?, weekly?), does it moves abruptly?, gradually?, does it spike?. > The economies of the currency pairs (strong?, weak?, budget deficits or surplius?). > The general market trend (up, still, down). > Where the current market price is relative to today's movement, yesterday's-, last week's-, last month's-,... > How do the microcharts (M1, M5, M15, M30, H1) relates to the macro- (4h, daily, weekly, monthly); and so on. Market Tip to connoted as trade examples - these are trades how I would like to realise it in the given market situation so to say a display windows of some of my trades.

The sole purpose of Forex trading is to earn profit while trading by making the right trade. Planning is very important to be successful; otherwise, you will loose your capital. Although, Forex is a fast moving and risky investment. If you are going to invest in the currency market, you must think about what strategy you are going to be using.

Moving averages as the basic indicator at Forex.   
  
The given chapter is dedicated to the problem of _Moving Averages_ (MA). It is one of the principal indices at Forex. In their book "Computer analysis of **future markets** ", Ch. Lebo and D. Douglas state that the greatest sums of real money are earned by making use exactly of the MA index. Even taken together, all other technical indices are less helpful. This is true. However, Ch. Lebo and D. Douglas have not mentioned that 19 of 20 traders do lose their game when they mainly use this index (MA).   
Here I try to expose the origin of such a high rate of losses and losers (19 of 20 traders!). The losses are caused by a somewhat simplified approach to the utilization of this so important technical index by "classicists" of Forex. The analogous view on MA index is inherent in the up-to-date analysts as well. Further, traders do the same. However, for the latter misunderstanding **_of the analytical approach to MA results in losses of real money at Forex_**.   
The ground course concerning MA one can get gratis in School of Trading for the Beginners at Forex, attached to Masterforex-V Trading Academy. Otherwise, the same information will cost you $200-500 at training courses, attached to **forex brokers**.   
Take a look at the charts submitted by J. Murphy in his book "The technical analysis of **future markets** " (Part 9). There plots are keep on "migrating" (_roaming_) from one manual of Forex to another.  
[http://www.masterforex-v.su/images_b...4/image002.jpg](http://www.masterforex-v.su/images_book/001_014/image002.jpg)  
_Chart 14.1. There is an example of combination of the 10-days simple MA (SMA) with the 40-days one. The reader should pay attention how accurately the tendency in price movement is repeated by the short 10-days MA. The 40-days MA is behind of the price movement somewhat farther. MA value evens up (l _evels_) the spread of prices. At the same time, these MA are always keep on being behind from the market dynamics in time. The 10-days MA is designated as the solid line; the 40-days MA is presented in the form of the dotted line. _   
[http://www.masterforex-v.su/images_b...4/image004.jpg](http://www.masterforex-v.su/images_book/001_014/image004.jpg)  
Chart14.2. _There is an example of the 20-days simple MA._ _Traders regard intersectios of MA curves by** _prices_** as signals for opening the corresponding positions. In the period that corresponds to the chart right border, the price indices are below the MA curve. This indicates that the market is at the stage in decline (_fall, decay_). One should pay attention to the following fact. The 20-days MA curve evens up (_levels_) the price dynamics. All the same, this 20-days MA curve is keeping behind from the market dynamics in time. _   
According to these pictures, everything is clear - isn't it? That is, at a certain point one must stake on "sell", at another point one must stake on "buy", etc. Probably, looking at this chart, any beginner could think that his account would be doubled after several days of the work at Forex. However, in fact, just 1 of 20 traders does earn his money. At the same time, all traders (19 losers included) make use of MA index in this or that form during their work at Forex.   
Hence, one must get to learn how to make use of MA in order to gain profit but not to sustain damages.   
First, let us examine the problems concerning MA. One must understand the reasons why the majority of traders lose their money when using MA. After this, one must find the way-out.   
**The problem #1.** Which charts the classicists of Forex do not include into their manuals.   
Let us scrutinize the graphs given below. After this, you can clearly understand why 19 of 20 traders leave Forex for good.

Moving averages as the basic indicator at Forex.   
  
_Chart 14.5. From_ _February 16 till April 16 of 2006, in GBP/USD pair movement 10th and 40th MA have 13 times intersected one another_.  
[](http://win.mail.ru/cgi-bin/readmsg/ot_2.GIF?id=11458808470000018884;0;7&mode=attachment&channel=)[http://www.masterforex-v.su/images_b...4/image008.gif](http://www.masterforex-v.su/images_book/001_014/image008.gif)  
_Chart 14.6 (the continuation (_prolongation_)). From March 14 till April 7 of 2006, in GBP/USD pair movement 10th and 40th MA have intersected one another 9 times._  
The **_conclusions_** are the following.  
Here we deal with a flat. In contrast to the trend, in a flat MA don't "obey" the rules submitted in the classical manuals. Rather on the contrary, when a quicker (_faster_) MA intersects a slower one, it can be a sign of an imminent reversal. Respectively, a deal must be open in the direction _opposite_ to the MA opening. Such a situation is typical of a trend within the time frame (TF) smaller than a flat within a larger TF.   
Conclusions.  
· One must not regard MA separately from the flat and trend - how it has been done in all classical manuals of Forex.  
· As regards the duration in time, a flat is longer than a trend.   
· First of all, you must learn to clearly distinguish the moment of the flat finish (_end)_ from the start of a trend (and v.v.). Only after this you may open a real account at Forex. Otherwise, you will lose your money - as it does happen to 19 of 20 traders.   
**The problem #2.** Within what TF one should work with MA. Some classicists of Forex prefer D1 (DeMarque). J. Murphy uses M5 (for the intra-day trading) and up to W1. E. Neiman and B. Williams use D1, W1, etc.   
However, these specialists avoid answering the principal question. That is, what a trader must do when MA are reversed towards different directions in various TF.   
· For instance, within M5 MA go upwards.  
· Within H1 they go downwards.  
· On the contrast, MA do come together in the chart H4.   
A. Elder has partially explained this problem in his three-shield system. Advantages and drawbacks of this approach are examined in a separate chapter.   
**The problem #3.** There can be trends strong (_heavy_) or weak (_feeble_). Let us examine a trend of the simplest kind - i.e., the intra-session one (see the chart on February 13, 2006). To the participants of Masterforex-V Trading Academy, I recommended the following.  
**a)**. As regards the European session on February 13, 2006, I advised to make super-short deals on "sale" with GBP/EUR pair.  
**b).** As regards the American session on February 13, 2006, I advised to make super-short deals on "buy" with the same currency pairs (GBP/EUR).  
c). As regards the European session on February 14, 2006, I recommended to make a prolonged deal on "sale" (all over the trading session).  
d). As regards the American session on February 14, 2006, I advised to make super-short deals on "buy" with the same currency pairs.  
In any classical manual of Forex the criteria of the difference between the strong (_heavy_) or weak (_feeble)_ trends are not pointed out. Consequently, the two advices to a trader can be given.  
A). to "allow the profit to come in (_to flow_)" when the trend is strong (_heavy_).  
B). to open super-short deals to gain the profit of 10-20 points because the currency pair movement is restricted, which is detectable during the very first movements.   
This technique, when used in the daily trading in Masterforex-V Trading Academy, gives reasons to doubt the correctness of the statements made by Ch. Lebo and D. Lucas. In their book "The computer analysis of future markets", the authors state that MA indices always indicate the trend direction. However, with MA one cannot estimate the trend strength (_the heaviness or weakness of this trend_). It is especially important if one estimates the trend strength with the help of MA indices, taken from other systems of Forex **technical analysis**.  
**Problem #4**. MA index drawbacks exert influence on other technical indicators, based on them (MA). Therefore, such indicator will deceive a trader during trades even more than MA do it.   
For instance, there are MACD**(** Moving Average Convergence/Divergence**)** , Alligator, Awesome Oscillator, CCI (Commodity Channel Index), Moving Average Envelopes, Moving Average of Oscillator, Bollinger Bands**,** Stochastic Oscillator, etc. All such indices are based on MA. When developing such indices, the authors issued from MA. Further each of them added to this basis what he liked. It could be the rate of change in the price, the trading volume, the closing price value with respect to the previous data, etc. Who has added what to MA does not make a secret. One can learn it, for instance, from MetaTrader software engineers from MetaQuotes Software Corp.  
In this connection, there arise the following questions.  
1\. What for each author adds to MA a characteristic according to his own choice?  
2\. Why there are so many indicators and, consequently, their developers? Why an improvement, made by one creator, has not satisfied a subsequent author?  
3\. What a drawback is inherent in the notion of MA itself - so that they must be infinitely (and to no effect) be improved, being unusable in their original form?  
Each of corrections made in MA is all the same imperfect. Really, just MetaTrader software contains dozens of technical indices. The majority of them are just another attempt at bringing those very MA to perfection. And this relates just to the indices selected by MetaTrader software engineers! The reader can guess how many indices have been sifted out (_rejected_) by these specialists. Probably, the reader will be confused when I'll tell that the number of indices excluded from MetaTrader software is even larger than that of the included ones.   
Hence, a large number of professionals waste their time, understanding that the indices available are unusable. You can judge by yourself. Let us put oscillators at the foot (_bottom_) of the chart. One can pick them out of one's choice - even all of them. In practice, all charts demonstrate the same. That is, each of newer designers has realized the drawbacks in the work of his predecessor. However, an original oscillator, developed by every new specialist, indicates the same data as oscillators developed by a previous author.   
In this connection, one of my students (a military man in the past) made joke: "it is like to keep on reparing the reciprocator instead of replacing it by the jet".   
**Problem #5.** According to J. Murphy, the following approach is axiomatic in the framework of the classical Forex (see "**technical analysis** of **future markets** "; Part 9). The point of entering the deal is the crossing of a slower MA by a quicker one. For instance, if MA #10 intersects MA #40 top-down, this corresponds to opening a deal on "sell". I can give thousands of examples when the deal opening in accordance with this formula was too late. This can happen in the cases of the trend strategic/tactical correction - especially under the conditions of strategic reversals. Otherwise, the deal opening according to this formula can be erroneous (fallacious) - in a flat. The above-given charts illustrate some cases when the opening according to this formula is wrong.  
Thus, a vicious circle becomes developed. On the one hand, the period length must be taken into account in order to exclude the "market noise" influence. On the other hand, one must consider the delay in MA as compared with real changes in the market. This problem is still unsolved.  
· The higher is MA number (100, 200), the weaker is MA reaction to the "market noise". At the same time, the delay in MA during reversals is more considerable.  
· The smaller is MA number (5, 10), the more intensive is MA reaction to the "market noise". That is, an ordinary (_common_) correction can be mistaken for a heavy and rash reversal.  
**Problem #6.** For traders, improvement in MA results in consequences even worse. All theorists and traders acknowledge that MA are being late. However, methods in solving the given problem are imperfect (so to say, "middle-of-the-road"). For instance, instead of simple MA, the following improved versions are submitted:  
* Exponential Moving Average;  
* Smoothed Moving Average;   
* Linear Weighted Moving Average.   
There are individuals who prefer to change simple MA into exponential MA, etc. (they consider this to be the means of optimization this index). J. Murphy struck such "admirers" the heaviest blow. In "**technical analysis** of **future markets** " (Part 9), he quoted a certain statistics. These data were initially submitted in the paper "Computers will help you in the game at **future markets** " by Hockhaimer in YB "Commodities", 1978. There the analysis is given to effectiveness of different **??? (TA)** in the period 1970-1976 at various **future markets**. The conclusion is the following. The simple MA is the most effective.  
Ch. Lebo and D. Lucas arrived at the analogous conclusion. These authors admit that there is a seeming (_apparent_) refinement of weighted- and exponential MA. However, in practice, every test observed or carried out by them indicates decided superiority of simple MA to all others from the viewpoint of gaining profit. According to Ch. Lebo and D. Lucas, the application of exponential MA, as a rule, results in "jerking", too costly for traders. This confirms the authors' opinion. That is, if a method of entering the deal is based on obscure calculations, there are more negative consequences of its application than positive ones. The future trade is rather art than a science. The mathematical refinement of a method does not guarantee profits.  
Such conclusions makes a true shock for those who neglect the problem of MA - for those who just prefer to replace simple MA by exponential-, smoothed- and linear-weighted ones. In particular, this concerns E. Neighman. The latter, in "Trader's small encyclopedia", persistently (_strongly_) recommends to apply the exponential MA (EMA). He states that simple MA to times reacts to one change in the course. Figuratively speaking, the simple MA (SMA) "barks" as a dog. For the first time this happens when a new value is received. For the second time the "barking" is heard when this value is quitted from the calculation of MA. As compared with SMA, EMA reacts to the change in one value of the course just once - i.e., when this value is received. This is why EMA is preferable.  
**Comments**. As the charts given _below_ indicate, _MA crosses the price_ 11 times. However, where did E. Neiman see dogs who cannot "bark" more than once or twice? One can imagine how many traders have lost their deposits due to the recommendations given by E. Neiman - a "cynologist" at Forex.  
The charts submitted below confirm my statements. Everybody can compare SMA with EMA in order to independently answer the following question. Is it preferable to apply rather EMA than SMA (as E. Neiman insists)? Or the difference between these indices is minimal? As one can see, analysts of Forex just play with exponential-, smoothed- and linear-weighted MA. In practice, various "improvements" in SMA do not heighten the working trader's profits.

_Chart 14.7. EUR/USD pair movement on April 17-24, 2006_  
[](http://win.mail.ru/cgi-bin/readmsg/ot_6.GIF?id=11458808470000018884;0;4&mode=attachment&channel=)[http://www.masterforex-v.su/images_b...4/image010.gif](http://www.masterforex-v.su/images_book/001_014/image010.gif)   
_Chart 14.8. EUR/USD pair movement on April 17-24, 2006_  
Both J. Murphy and Hockhaimer were perfectly correct in pointing out the difference between SMA and EMA. At the same time, they have not drawn the principal conclusion that one can easily make issuing from the statistics submitted by these authors. That is both types of MA just slightly differ one from another. Besides, the same drawbacks are inherent in the both variants of MA.  
· According to J. Murphy, deals must be opened after a slower MA is intersected by a faster one. However, in this case occurs a substantial (_time_) delay. This is depicted in the above-given charts (the intersection of MA ##10, 40). One can clearly see that MA intersection takes place when almost a half of the path is **_already_** passed through.   
· According to J. Murphy, a deal must be opened not after the first intersection of MA ##10 and 40 but after the second one (the so-called "optimization"). However, I can give a large number of examples where the 1st intersection yields hundreds point of profit. At the same time, the 2nd intersection occurs in a flat (in its essence, it is attenuation of the previous basic movement). That is, J. Murphy does not recommend opening a deal during this basic intensive movement! Besides, as one can see in these charts, MA 12 times intersect one another. According to J. Murphy, which intersection is the 2nd one?   
· How can J. Murphy recommend such "optimization" when it results in the following?  
· Table 14.1*, see attachment, please  
  
As one can see, J. Murphy's results after his "optimization" are worse than 50/50. That is 322 deals of 608 are made at a loss.  
· J. Murphy made an attempt to artificially combine MA with timing loops (_time cycles_). For this purpose, he made use of Fibonacci number "mysticism". That is, he chose Fibonacci numbers according to his own tastes. Applying such numbers in some cases, under other conditions he "happily forgot" about them. In this sense, the case of MA ##10 and 40 is typical.  
· J. Murphy has not elaborated a universal combination of MA. In each example different combinations of MA are submitted (either 10-40 or 1-21, or 13-34-144, or 4-9-18, etc.).  
And what is more, according to J. Murphy, MA duration must be chosen so that it should correspond to the cycles that determine the given market development.  
As a trader, I arrive at the distressing **conclusions** concerning J. Murphy technique of MA application at Forex - as J. Murphy gives examples of currency pairs.  
· J. Murphy uses different combinations of MA at the daily trades. Hoever, as a trader, he has not elaborated his own "working" combination of MA.  
· Different MA can be required for different charts. J. Murphy clearly garbles historical examples of situations at the market, suitable for various combinations of MA.  
· J Murphy himself considers that one can get a reliable prognosis with the help of his charts. The reader can develop his own opinion concerning this statement. Just I wonder, of what kind this "reliable prognosis" can be. Really, a universal technique of giving analysis to the market is not developed. In addition, in different situations different MA are used.  
· However, J. Murphy never kept back that he was not a trader but a "technical analyst" and a Professor in New-York Financial Institute. In spring, 1981 the leadership of this institute ask him to organize a course of the **technical analysis**.   
As far as I'm concerned, I made no secret of my attitude towards "analysts". Really, to what the latter can teach a beginner or an experienced trader if such "analyst" cannot work at the stock exchange himself?  
As it is evident, an author of detective stories (even the most gifted individual but not a lawyer) will never be invited to lecture in a department of law. At the same time, the analogous situation at Forex is almost a rule. For instance, training courses at **forex brokers** are mainly based on the books by J. Murphy and E. Neiman. I have already exposed mistakes, inaccuracies and drawbacks, inherent in just one chapter (#9) of the book "**technical analysis** of **future markets** " by Murphy. As regards the whole book, the number of incorrectnesses of various types is about several hundreds. All courses of training attached to various **forex brokers** contain those very mistakes. As the result, at least 19 of 20 traders lose their deposits.   
As regards E. Neiman's recommendations concerning the order of sequence of MA numbers, the situation is not better.  
Giving analysis to the 6-day chart of prices, this author uses 1-8; 8-13; 8-21; 1-21. He states that contradictions in the signal can happen at the intersections between 55-144 and 89-144.   
Giving analysis to the daily chart of prices, this author uses 8-13; 8-21; 1-55; 1-89. No contradictions are observed.  
Giving analysis to the 3-hour chart of prices, this author uses 34-55; 1-89; 1-144; 8-89. The contradictions in the signal can happen at the intersections between 13-144 and 21-144.   
Giving analysis to the hourly chart, this author uses 1-34; 34-55; 1-144; 8-89. The contradictions in the signal can happen at the intersection between 55 and 89.  
Giving analysis to the £15-min chart of prices, this author uses 34-144; 1-144; 1-55.  
And now let us scrutinize these statements.  
What kind of MA must be chosen when a chart D1 is displayed at the trader's terminal? Among 8-13, 8-21, 1-55, 1-89 what pairs would be preferable?  
Probably, independently of the chosen MA, the result of such "recommendations" by E. Neiman will be the same. I would like once more to emphasize that 19 of 20 traders all over the world regularly lose their deposits. By te way, what a combination does E. Neiman use by himself in tradings?  
Any working trader will submit his own combinations of MA numbers. After this, he will add other MA numbers that can be used.  
However either E. Neiman or J. Murphy and other "analysts" don't do this. Probably, E. Neiman, a leading employee of "UkrSocBank", has no MA working combination of his own. Maybe, he just writes "financial bestsellers". According to Alpina public house, in his books the basic notions and techniques, necessary for the successful trading, are submitted in the form easy of access. This is a point to be considered.   
**Problem #7**. There exists a general rule, correct for the business of any kind: to buy cheaply and to sell expensively. How this rule can be correlated with the principles of work with MA?  
One must clearly detect circumstances when it is possible to work against the rules of MA - i.e., in contradiction to the classicists' viewpoints. For instance, one can work against the principal tendency of Ch. Dow. In one's work, one may work against the rules of MA and contradict ideas of J. Murphy, E. Neiman, or Ch. Lebo and D. Lucas. These rules are not submitted in any manual of Forex.  
There is an example of the real work against MA rules. It is taken from Masterforex-V Trading Academy in the on-line-regime (see April 19, 2006). One should pay attention to the following chart.  
[](http://win.mail.ru/cgi-bin/readmsg/ot_6.GIF?id=11458808470000018884;0;4&mode=attachment&channel=)[http://www.masterforex-v.su/images_b...4/image010.gif](http://www.masterforex-v.su/images_book/001_014/image010.gif)  
_Chart 14.9_.   
According to Masterforex-V, "sells" of EUR have been closed at 1.2286. The corresponding reasoning one can find in the chargeable enclosures. In particular, there the problems of calculating a local peak, of getting into a lock at this peak, etc. are examined.   
Participants of Masterforex-V closed forum made the following remarks about the chart on April 19, 2006.   
· The maximal point of GBP _course_ is 1.7938-46, the local peak being at 1.7938. That is, opening a deal in vicinity to 1.7853, a participant ("_rich"_) has correctly calculated GBP stock reserve - i.e., 85-93 points per the trading session.  
· On April 20, 2006, at 22.16, another participant ("_hawt_ ") opened a branch, called "the death of EUR". I must emphasize that here we deal just with the trading on April 20, 2006. During that day EUR fell more than by 112 points - from 1.2396 down to 1.2284 under the condition of the ascending intra-week trend. That very day GBP, the currency allied to EUR, fell by 186 points (from 1.7938 down to 1.7752).  
Now we scrutinize the above-given chart. We are interested in detecting the signs that can permit us to predict EUR and GBP reversal with respect to USD -several hours earlier than the reversal can actually happen. One must also take into account that the chart depicts the situation the half of the day before the MA #10 crossing MA#40 downwards. Accurately dealing with these details, one can understand a series of rules of working against MA reversal. One can regard the conclusions made by Ch. Dow and J. Murphy a new. According to these authors, the tendency can be seen just from the inside (in the middle of it). J. Murphy states the following. No system that follows a tendency can capture (_absorb, usurp)_ either the summit of the market or its foundation - i.e., the origins of the ascending or descending tendencies. The corresponding attempts are not prospective. This problem is in detail discussed in "**technical analysis** of **future markets** " (Part 2) by J. Murphy.  
In brief, one can make the following conclusions.   
· MA is an important parameter from the viewpoint of giving analysis to Forex market and gaining regular profits there.  
· At present, the MA problem presentation technique by "classicists" of Forex has clearly appeared in deadlock. This is why the overwhelming majority of traders lose their money.   
· I would like to emphasize the following. Either the numbers of MA, or their modifications (the simple-, exponential-, or linear weighted MA) do not matter. One must clearly distinguish when the work either along - or against MA reversal would be preferable. The reader must open a real account not earlier clearly understanding of the following factors. One must know when to work on the MA reversal and when against it. One must see with which other systems of analysis the technique of MA should be combined - in order to detect long and super-short deals. One must learn the signs of reversal and the trend continuation - as well as correlation between the trends themselves. You see, your chances to get into the company of 19 traders-losers from 20 are considerably prevail the opportunity of being 1 of 20 traders who regularly gains profit at Forex.

Do you now why price is trending only about 30% (or less) of time?

Stay at the sideline and wait. Open trades we could seen 48. The account will made 025% per day. So we don't have stress if the market will go in counterpart direction or will give us the profit earlier. This kind of position trading are very powerful and risk-free.  
  
_Happiness is the way!_

Why would you want to split one trade in so many positions. So many would be more difficult to manage. Rather than 10 positions why not 5 or even better 4.  
Can you explain the logic in this.

Hi bcarbon  
  
First of all it is a style like I trade. Other interested traders could trade their position styles in their ways.  
  
If you have take a look at the open trades you'll have noticed that every open position with the same currency pair could defined with different exit points.   
  
Personally I don't like "the main trade". I like many parts of them, called positions. So one trade have for me max. 10 positions. If I would go in the market with two positions at EURUSD I calculated then with 20 positions maximum. So I can go later in with even more 3 or 4 or 8 positions, if the market price has moved more up or down.  
  
Position trading can yield far better results across varying market conditions than a single main trade approach.  
  
Often I trade with several positions at different time frames and/or only for a few minutes, and/or let other ones run at several murrey math levels and/or till different pivotal points. So I can go erlier out with a part of them and/or at different timeframe levels and let the other further race. Often if price moves in counterpart direction I go in with several positions next lower/higher level again. For me it istn't something "confusing", so I make it since *"thousend of years"!  
  
See also #[**439**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3996660&postcount=439).  
  
_By contrast with "easy" and "not so easy" orders, - of course, you know it is not that simple - I compare my positions more like Huskies, well-arranged and extremely sportive (they could go in this direction or even so in the counterpart one). No problem for me to keep track of. May be not something for everybody. One spot is as good as another._

By the way - Basics  
Make the calculation 10 x 0.1 or 5 x 0.2, may be 3 x 0.3 or 4 x 0.25 where is the major difference in your question?

First the **Commodity Channel Index** was developed as the indicator for determining of reversal points in the commodity markets. But then it became rather popular in the share market and in Forex market. CCI was created by Donald Lambert.  
The supposition on which the indicator is based consists that all actives move under influence of definite cycles, and maxima and minima appear with definite intervals. CCI corresponds to oscillators, measuring speed of price fluctuations. The index demonstrates a deflection of the ongoing price from its average value. Lambert developed a constant at a level 0.015 that approximately from 70 up to 80 % of CCI values were between levels -100 and +100 -- for the purposes of measurement.

http://www.forexrealm.com/technical-analysis/technical-indicators/commodity-channel-index.htmlFollow-up  
  
For the purposes of scaling, Lambert has installed a constant at a level 0.015 that approximately from 70 up to 80 % of CCI values were between levels -100 and +100.  
[http://www.forexrealm.com/forex-imag...ators/cci2.gif](http://www.forexrealm.com/forex-images/technical-indicators/cci2.gif) **Chart:**  
  
[http://www.forexrealm.com/forex-imag...ators/cci7.png](http://www.forexrealm.com/forex-images/technical-indicators/cci7.png)   
  
The **Commodity Channel Index** is moving over and under a zero mark. The percent of Commodity Channel Index values (between +100 and -100) correspond to the number of the periods used for its building. Shorter - with smaller quantity of the periods - CCI will be more inconstant, and if less - its values will be placed in a range section between +100 and-100. Correspondingly, the greater number of periods will be used for CCI measurement, the more values percent of the indicator will be between the points of +100 and -100.  
The basic characteristic of the CCI named by the author is one-third of full cycle. For instance, from a minimum up to an upcoming minimum or from a maximum up to an upcoming maximum, or if a market movements' cycle is thirty days, recommended value for CCI is ten days.  
Important: The determination of the cycle's length doesn't depend on the Commodity Channel Index and any other tools. It's is a rather many-sided indicator which can cause a wide range of purchase or sell signals. CCI is used both by investors and traders for determining of reversal price points. It is extreme on the price chart and trend force and its results should be used together from the rest of indicators.  
**  
How to use CCI**  
  
Here is the author's advice on the work with the CCI index in case it moves above +100 and below-100 and sends sell or purchase signals. Buy or sell signals happen 20 - 30 % of the time while from 70 up to 80 % of time Commodity Channel Index's value is fluctuating between +100 and -100. It's supposed that if CCI overcomes the level of +100 from below upwards, it means that the currency pair is moving in the direction of the strong ascending trend, thus there is a clear purchase signal. And once CCI goes under +100 the position is supposed to be closed on a return signal. At the same time, it's considered that if Commodity Channel Index moves to -100 point from top to down, it means that the currency pair is meeting a strong descending trend, and there's a sale signal. As soon as CCI again crosses the level of -100 this position is considered closed.  
Later CCI started to work for determining if market is overbought or oversold, for definition of reversal points. The currency pair is considered overbought once it overcomes +100 level and is oversold once CCI goes under -100 point. While CCI stays in an overbought position which is above +100, the sale signal appears in case if CCI crosses a level +100 in the opposite direction - from the peak to the bottom. After CCI has entered into an oversold zone which is under -100 level, the purchase signal appears when CCI crosses -100 point in the opposite direction - from the bottom to the peak.  
CCI is based on divergence analysis which widens a trading signal. Positive discrepancy less than -100 increases the signal force when the price crosses a level-100 from the bottom to the top. It happens only if there are 2 consecutive minima on CCI when the second minimum is more than the first one on the indicator but below the first one on the chart of prices. Negative divergence over +100 increases the signal force when CCI crosses +100 from top to bottom. The condition for this situation is 2 consecutive maxima on the indicator above +100 when the second maximum is under the first one on the indicator, but above on the chart of prices.  
One can treat break of trend lines formed on the indicator as input or output signals from a position. At overbought - above +100 - the break of the trend line downwards is supposed a sale signal and at an oversold level - below-100 - the break of the trend line upwards is supposed a signal to growth of the market. Thus these lines are also based on the connection of consecutive maxima or minima.  
**  
The drawbacks of Commodity Channel Index**  
  
The CCI works effectively only in cases when the market is really subject to rather permanent cycles because it was developed definitely for the cyclic markets. That's why it's more problematic to choose an optimum period if Forex cycles are difficultly distinguished in market. Caution: Every, even an irreproachable indicator used wrongly results in a number of false signals and accordingly causes considerable losses in your deal. So before using any indicators on real accounts, first test their work for the demonstration account or check them as trading strategy.

CCI Indikator  
  
Geschrieben durch [Staff](http://www.forexwelt.com/author/staff/) [Keine Komm.](http://www.forexwelt.com/cci-indikator.html#comments)   
Last Updated: June 9, 2010  
[](http://www.forexonline.de/wp-content/uploads/cci.jpg)[http://www.forexonline.de/wp-content...ci-300x204.jpg](http://www.forexonline.de/wp-content/uploads/cci-300x204.jpg)  
Der **Indikator CCI** – Commodity Channel Index – ist im Forex sehr nützlich, da er uns erlaubt, die Deviation des statistisch durchschnittlichen Preises zu messen. Der Indikator CCI kann zwei verschiedene Werte beinhalten:  
wenn Der Indikator hoch ist, ist der laufende Preis höher als der Durchschnittspreis. Wenn er dagegen tief ausfällt, bedeutet dies, dass der laufende Preis unter dem Durchschnittspreis liegt.  
Um den **CCI** zu nutzen, kann man zwei verschiedene Techniken anwenden. Zuerst sollte man die **Divergenz der ICC-Werte** bestimmen, umden realen Marktpreis zu erreichen . Die Divergenz ensteht durch immer wieder neu auftretende Preismaxima und -minima. Die Werte des CCI hingegen folgen nicht dem Gesetz dieser periodischen Schwankungen. Wenn folglich die CCI Werte sinken, während die Preise gleichzeitig ansteigen und vice versa, ensteht hierbei die sogenannte Divergenz, die durchaus ein Wechsel des Preisverlaufs anzeigen kann .  
Die zweite Variante besteht darin, einen CCI Indikator als **Hypergekauft oder Hyperverkauft-Indikator** zu verwenden. Normalerweise verfügen die Preise übr einen Wert zwischen +100 und -100 des CCI -Wertes. Wenn der CCI Wert unter -100 liegt, befinden wir uns in einer Hyperverkauft -Situation. Dabei steigt der Preis. Wenn hingegen der CCI Indikator über +100 liegt, befinden wir uns in der Hypergekauft -Situation. Der Trend ist dann rückläufig.  
Die Handhabung derartiger Indikatoren ist leicht. Die richtige Auswahl der jeweiligen Methode hängt von unserem Know-how ab.

Looks like it is price in CCI, and you have edge there, because you can see 0 level from price and real oversold and overbought levels (100 & -100 or 200 & -200).  
Sell and buy from S/R levels, when CCI is coming back in to BB.  
Exits maybe opposite signal.  
What you think.

Anyway, you have a great system, but to avoid false signals, maybe best is to take signals only from S/R levels.

Hi juhanimi  
  
Could you give some examples, if possible with a chart and describe in action these false signals, please. So we can clearify things better.

Doability arguments!  
Seems your idea would enrich Forex Life.  
Could you specify it in greater details, say if you post some examples with explanations furthermore, so all here could follow your logical arguments and get a feeling with somemore case examples. Use arrows and circles, text...at your chart, please!  
(P.1, #[**1**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3928224&postcount=1) "option" "trendlines" includes S/R).  
  
Sincerely,  
FXcube  
  
_Please, more_

Is It Possible to Trade Forex on a Part-Time Basis with Success?  
  
Currency trading is an exciting new market for ambitious individuals who would like to test their skills in a truly competitive environment with potentially very significant rewards. It is not simple to become proficient in forex, you need to commit some time, and make some effort in learning about and practicing trading, before you achieve results that are favorable to any degree. This fact sometimes scares potential traders to such an extent that they choose not to entertain the idea of currency trading at all, due to time limits, and the constraints of offline life. In this article, we are going to take a look at the plausibility of a part-time forex trading experience for the average person.  
Perhaps the most exciting feature of the forex trading experience is the almost unlimited degree of flexibility involved. The fractal nature of charts means that, ignoring broker costs, trading at long or short term is essentially the same business from the technical point of view. The fundamental point of view, on the other hand, implies that it is possible to apply entirely different methods as a long or short term trader.  
Thus one can be a part-time forex trader on both a long term and a short term basis, but with different options available, and differing approaches being necessary. A part-time short term trader must follow a purely technical approach and apply money management methods with rigor and discipline. In this case the time of entry does not matter that much, but we strongly advise that periods of high volatility be avoided unless one has an ample amount of time available to be devoted to the absorbtion of the steady stream of news flooding the market. As such, the part time trader would probably thrive when the market is calmer, trading is subdued, and technical factors dominate, a scenario that is most often encountered towards the closing hours of the market.  
A long term part-time trader, on the other hand, must choose the time for entry into the market very carefully. Since a position held on the long term requires strong conviction and analysis, it is crucial that a period of deep and thorough analysis precede the actual trading action. The advantage of fundamental, long-term trading is in its greater potential for very significant rewards, and also for reduced risk, contrary to common assumptions. A long trader must use low leverage since he is going to keep his position dormant for a long time, and to have it survive volatility, high or even moderately high leverage has to be avoided, which makes potential losses smaller, provided that clear criteria exist for the closing of a position.  
It is not really possible to decide which firm is more suitable to a part-time trading experience merely by reading online forex broker reviews and going through ratings. You need to go and test the firm actively for a period. The part-time trader demands a high degree of accuracy and reliability from the broker because he can't afford to see his trading platform fail during the comparatively infrequent periods when he's online. So make your choices wisely; but part-time trading is indeed a workable approach with some practice.

After good signal in higher timeframe, you could go to play in lower timeframe, and find levels and take all signals from S/R levels to same direction.

Hello juhanimi  
  
Weekly EMA10 and EMA20 are parallel, and the last spinning tops before the actual candle after an bearish engulfing pattern say that bullish and bearish market players seems to be more in a tug of war at the moment. So the market don't know where to go.   
  
May be we could see further little ups and downs (1.22 - 1.33).  
  
Monthly EMA lines are coming more together and price moves between EMA100 and EMA200 (1.22 - 1.295).   
  
So I would wait at daily chart if the spinning tops are forming further price patterns, as components e.g. of Morning Star, Evening Star, Haramis, Hammers, Shooting Star...and would prefere to trade at M15/H1.   
  
Of cours Daily CI(14) is over 100 but EMA Lines are going parallel, say without momentum at the time.   
  
So may be it's better to trade M30/H1. I would do so.  
  
See also price patterns at the monthly chart, please. If monhtly candle would forming an inside bar this month then it could be a confirmation for the engulfing pattern and we could seen higher prices, so the Euro will getting stronger.  
  
Hope it helps.

I would wait at daily chart till CCI is at his next Top or Bottom and would prefere to trade at H1/H4 in the meantime.  
  
...and in a more global view to trade the monthly range between 1.3150 - 1.3680 and waiting for a breakout!

If MS3 1.5344 will be broken downwards then go short. EMA100 at 1.5328  
  
EMA lines are coming more parallel and so market seems to be moves in ups and downs till momentum getting stronger for making the next beakout. In the meantime I would prefere to trade the range box with H1 and H4 and at shorter time frames several descening or ascending shorter trendlines .

It seems that there might be other currency pairs more attractive for a bigger investment. Why to invest in an indifferent euro, when other currency pair shows clearer signals? Why do invest the money in some currency pairs with a more comfortabe risk-reward ratio, isn't it?. European shares seems also to be at his average level.

I trade only EUR/USD, and I find every day trades.  
H1 was top reversal and H4 upthrust and resistance, so I think I had odds on my side.

Price Action: The Perfect Forex Trading System  
  
Trading the Forex market has become very popular in the last few years. But how difficult is it to achieve success in the Forex trading arena? Or let me rephrase this question, how many traders achieve consistent profitable results trading the Forex market? Unfortunately very few, only 5% of traders achieve this goal. One of the main reasons of this is because Forex traders focus in the wrong information to make their trading decisions and totally forget about the most important factor: Price behavior.  
  
Most Forex trading systems are made off technical indicators (a moving average (MA) crossover, overbought/oversold conditions in an oscillator, etc.) But what are technical indicators? They are just a series of data points plotted in a chart; these points are derived from a mathematical formula applied to the price of any given currency pair. In other words, it is a chart of price plotted in a different way that helps us see other aspects of price.   
  
There is an important implication on this definition of technical indicators. The fact that the readings obtained from them are based on price action. Take for instance a long MA crossover signal, the price has gone up enough to make the short period MA crossover the long period MA generating a long signal. Most traders see it as “the MA crossover made the price go up,” but it happened the other way around, the MA crossover signal occurred because the price went up. Where I’m trying to get here is that at the end, price behavior dictates how an indicator will act, and this should be taken into consideration on any trading decision made.   
  
Trading decisions based on technical indicators without taking price action into consideration will give us less accurate results. For example, again a long signal generated by a MA crossover as the market approaches an important resistance level. If the price suddenly starts to bounce back off that important level there is no point on taking this signal, price action is telling us the market doesn’t want to go up. Most of the time, under this circumstances, the market will continue to fall down, disregarding the MA crossover.   
  
Don’t get me wrong here, technical indicators are a very important aspect of trading. They help us see certain conditions that are otherwise difficult to see by watching pure price action. But when it comes to pull the trigger, price action incorporation into our Forex trading system will definitely put the odds in our favor, it will generate higher probability trades.   
  
  
So, how to create a perfect Forex trading system?  
  
  
First of all, you need to make sure your trading system fits your trading personality; otherwise you will find it hard to follow it. Every trader has different needs and goals, thus there is no system that perfectly fits all traders. You need to make your own research on various trading styles and technical indicators until you find a concept that perfectly works for you. Make sure you know the nature of whatever technical indicator used.   
  
Secondly, incorporate price action into your system. So you only take long signals if the price behavior tells you the market wants to go up, and short signals if the market gives you indication that it will go down.   
  
Third, and most importantly, you need to have the discipline to follow your Forex trading system rigorously. Try it first on a demo account, then move on to a small account and finally when feeling comfortably and being consistent profitable apply your system in a regular account.  
  
_You need to make sure your trading system fits your trading personality._

What is Price Action?  
  
Price action is essentially the closest relative to order flow in FX and across all markets. It is the direct result of the order flow. Thus, it has the fingerprints of bias, speed of buying/selling, where buying and selling is occurring (support/resistance) when a breakout is genuine and where a likely reversal is occurring. From the continuous flow of price action which pours onto our charts, all indicators are born and thus dependent upon it. Hence, understanding and being able to interpret price action becomes an essential component to our trading. It is a way to get into the essence behind what creates the indicators and most technical signals in the markets.

**What Does _Price Action_ Mean?**  
The movement of a security's price. Price action is encompassed in technical and chart pattern analysis, which attempt to find order in the sometimes seemingly random movement of price. Swings (high and low), tests of resistance and consolidation are some examples of price action.   
  
The candlestick and price bar are important tools for analyzing price action, since they help traders visualize of price movement. Candlestick patterns such as the Harami, engulfing pattern and cross are all examples of visually interpreted price action.

**Investopedia explains _Price Action_**  
No two people will analyze every bit of price action the same way, and that is why a lot of traders find the concept of price action so elusive. Quite literally, price action is everything that a security's price does, and just like every other facet of analysis, it is purely subjective.

**What Does _Downtrend_ Mean?**  
Describes the price movement of a financial asset when the overall direction is downward. A formal downtrend occurs when each successive peak and trough is lower than the ones found earlier in the trend.  
  
[http://i.investopedia.com/inv/dictio.../downtrend.GIF](http://i.investopedia.com/inv/dictionary/terms/downtrend.GIF)   
  
Notice how each successive peak and trough is lower than the previous one. For example, the low at Point 3 is lower than the low at Point 1. The downtrend will be deemed broken once the price closes above the high at Point 4.

What does Bollinger Band mean?  
  
A band plotted two standard deviations away from a simple moving average, developed by famous technical trader John Bollinger.  
  
[http://i.investopedia.com/inv/dictio...lingerband.gif](http://i.investopedia.com/inv/dictionary/terms/bollingerband.gif)  
  
In this example of Bollinger bands, the price of the stock is banded by an upper and lower band along with a 21-day simple moving average.

Investopedia explains Bollinger Band  
  
Because standard deviation is a measure of volatility, Bollinger bands adjust themselves to the market conditions. When the markets become more volatile, the bands widen (move further away from the average), and during less volatile periods, the bands contract (move closer to the average). The tightening of the bands is often used by technical traders as an early indication that the volatility is about to increase sharply.  
  
This is one of the most popular technical analysis techniques. The closer the prices move to the upper band, the more overbought the market, and the closer the prices move to the lower band, the more oversold the market.

Die BollingerBänder  
  
Entstehung   
Die BollingerBänder (Bollinger Bands) wurden von John Bollinger von Bollinger Capital Management Anfang der 80ziger Jahre als Indikator erfunden und gehören mittlerweile zum Standard-Werkzeug der TechnischenAnalyse.   
Seine Idee wurde durch das statistischen Phänomen der Häufung in der Mitte (goldene Mitte) angeregt, da in normalverteilten Wertegruppen sich eine bestimmte Menge an Werten mit einer bestimmten Wahrscheinlichkeit befindet, die um einen festen Betrag von einem Mittelwert abweichen. Daraus lässt sich ableiten, dass innerhalb eines Kanals sich alle Kurse befinden müssen, da sie nur begrenzt weit vom Mittelwert (Gleitender-Durchschnitt=MA) notieren können. Hierbei werden BreakOuts (geringe Prozentzahl<=5%) vernachlässigt. Der (Gauss´schen) Normalverteilung wird die Standardabweichung gebildet: es wird die Schwankungsbreite gebildet, d.h. in wie weit der Kurs historisch um den 20-Tage-Durchschnitt geschwankt hat.   
  
Anwendung   
Hauptanwendungsgebiet der BollingerBänder sind Aktien: hier wird versucht durch die entstandenen Bänder innerhalb dieser zu traden (Kanaltrading). Auch werden Ausbrüche aus den Bändern getradet.   
  
Beschreibung   
Bollinger Bänder sind "Umhüllungslinien" des Kursverlaufs: sie umhüllen den Kursverlauf Basiswertes (Underlyings) mit einem variablen Abstand. Somit ergibt sich jeweils ein Band oberhalb und unterhalb des Kurses. Innerhalb dieser Bänder bewegt sich der Kurs. Der Abstand zwischen dem Kurs und einem BollingerBand wird als Spannbreite verstanden.   
Die BollingerBänder bauen auf einem Gleitenden-Durchschnitt (Moving Average=MA) auf und geben die Marktvolatilität als Abstände nach oben und unten zum Kursverlauf wieder. Somit resultieren die Bänder aus einer Spanne von 2 Standardabweichungen über und unter dem Gleitenden-Durchschnitt. Der Abstand der Bänder voneinander in Relation mit der Gleitenden-Durchschnittslinie steht somit in Abhängigkeit zu der aktuellen Schwankungsbreite des Underlyings/Basiswertes. Die Bänder verwenden also Maß für die Verschiebung die Standardabweichung, um die Volatilität des Underlyings wiederzuspiegeln und grenzen so die zu erwartenden Kursschwankungen ein. Die Entfernung zu der Gleitenden-Durchschnittslinie beträgt als Standard die 2-fache Standardabweichung der Periode. Man erhält zwei Kurven, indem man die Standardabweichung zu dem Gleitenden-Durchschnitt (20-Tage) hinzuaddiert und subtrahiert.   
Die BollingerBänder sind somit sehr einfach: Sie bauen auf einem Gleitenden-Durchschnitt auf, der um je zwei Standardabweichungen nach oben und unten verschoben wird.   
Dieser Ansatz ist bereits von den Envelopes bekannt. Jedoch verwenden die Envelopes einen feststehenden Prozentsatz für die Abweichung/Verschiebung, während hingegen die BollingerBänder variabel sind. Die Variabilität ergibt sich aus der Schwankungsbreite, so dass sich die Bänder individuell dem Underlying/ Basiswert anpassen. Dies ist das besondere an den BollingerBändern, im Gegensatz zu den Indikatoren,Oszillatoren u. Envelopes: die BollingerBänder sind selbstadjustierend.   
Statistisch gesehen, liegen 95% der Kurse innerhalb der BollingerBänder (2-fache Standardabweichung), genau darauf bauen die Trading-Ansätze auf. Bei der einfachen Standardabweichung beträgt der Prozentsatz 70%, dieser wird aber kaum verwendet.   
  
Standard Einstellungen   
-Periode zwischen 20-21 Tage (arithmetischer Gleitender-Durchschnitt)   
  
Weitere Einstellungen   
-Periode bis zu 50 Tagen -schnellere Reaktionszeit: Exponentieller-Durchschnitt -verlangsamtere Reaktionszeit: Geglätteter-Durchschnitt   
  
Berechnung   
Oberes BollingerBand = MA + 2s Mittleres BollingerBand = MA (eigentlich kein Band, sondern der MA auf dem die Berechnung aufbaut) Unteres BollingerBand = MA -2s   
  
Trading-Ansatz...   
  
... Perioden geringer Volatilität   
Bei geringer Volatilität liegen die Bänder sehr eng beieinander, da der Kurs und somit der Gleitende-Durchschnitt langsam seitwärts tendiert (geringe Standardabweichung/Volatilität). Mit einem baldigen Ausbruch (short/long) kann gerechnet werden, da die Wahrscheinlichkeit einer starken Preisbewegung wächst.   
  
[](http://www.aktienboard.com/wiki/Datei:Bollinger1.gif)[http://www.aktienboard.com/mw/images...Bollinger1.gif](http://www.aktienboard.com/mw/images/e/eb/Bollinger1.gif)   
  
... Perioden mit Volatilität   
Da der Kurs sich zu 95% innerhalb der BollingerBänder bewegt, kann man sein Trading anhand der Umkehrpunkte innerhalb der Bänder ausrichten, da der Kurs sich zwischen den Bändern schwankt. Der Kurse bewegt sich normalerweise von einem Band zum anderen Band. Umkehrpunkte befinden sich jeweils an dem oberen u. unteren Rand BollingerBand.   
Umkehrpunkte befinden sich auch innerhalb der Mitte der Bänder (ähnlich wie bei den TradingRanges: MiddleRange), sind jedoch nicht allzu zuverlässig.   
  
... Top/Bottom Bildung an den Bändern   
Bildet sich in der Nähe (außerhalb/innerhalb) eines Band ein Top/Bottom als extreme Punkte wiederholen, so ist dies als Anzeichen für eine bevorstehende Trendwende zu werten.   
  
... Ausbruch aus den Bändern   
Hier kann der Ausbruch (Schlußkurs außerhalb der Bänder) als FalseBreak/Fehlausbruch behandelt werden. Da sich der Kurs zu 95% innerhalb der BollingerBänder bewegt, ist mit einem baldigen Wiedereintritt in die BollingerBänder zu rechnen. Ein Ausbruch aus den Bändern stellt daher im Regelfall eine extreme Übertreibung dar, die kurzfristig korrigiert werden sollte: man traded die Bewegung in Richtung der Ausbruchsstelle. Diese Gegenbewegung ist erst beendet, wenn der Kurs wieder in die BollingerBänder eintaucht.   
  
[](http://www.aktienboard.com/wiki/Datei:Bollinger2.gif)[http://www.aktienboard.com/mw/images...Bollinger2.gif](http://www.aktienboard.com/mw/images/a/ac/Bollinger2.gif)   
  
Allerdings sind die restlichen 5% beachten: der starke Kursausbruch kann auch auf eine längere Auf-/Abwärtsbewegung hindeuten (solange, bis der Gleitende-Durchschnitt mit seinen BollingerBänder wieder nachzieht/korrigiert).   
  
... steigenden/fallenden BollingerBändern   
Steigende/Fallende BollingerBänder können als Trendfolge-Indikator genutzt werden und zeigen einen Aufwärts-/Abwärtstrend an. Die Kurse erreichen dann kaum das jeweils andere Band, sondern schwanken nur zwischen dem Gleitenden-Durchschnitt u. dem oberen Band (im Aufwärtstrend) oder dem unteren Band (im Abwärtstrend).

http://stockcharts.com/help/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_ indicators:bollinger_bands  
  
**Bollinger Bands**  
  
**Introduction**  
  
Developed by John Bollinger, Bollinger Bands are volatility bands placed above and below a moving average. Volatility is based on the [standard deviation](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:standard_deviation), which changes a volatility increase and decreases. The bands automatically widen when volatility increases and narrow when volatility decreases. This dynamic nature of Bollinger Bands also means they can be used on different securities with the standard settings. For signals, Bollinger Bands can be used to identify M-Tops and W-Bottoms or to determine the strength of the trend. Signals derived from narrowing BandWidth are discussed in the [chart school article on BandWidth.](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:bollinger_band_width)   
  
**SharpCharts Calculation**  
  
  
* Middle Band = 20-day simple moving average (SMA)  
* Upper Band = 20-day SMA + (20-day standard deviation of price x 2)   
* Lower Band = 20-day SMA - (20-day standard deviation of price x 2)

[Click here for download this spreadsheet example.](http://stockcharts.com/school/data/media/chart_school/technical_indicators_and_overlays/bollinger_bands/cs-bbands.xls)   
  
Bollinger Bands consist of a middle band with two outer bands. The middle band is a [simple moving average](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_averages) that is usually set at 20 periods. A simple moving average is used because a simple moving average is also used in the standard deviation formula. The look-back period for the standard deviation is the same as for the simple moving average. The outer bands are usually set 2 standard deviations above and below the middle band.   
  
[](http://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=SPY&p=D&st=2009-04-01&en=2009-06-30&id=p97658221558&listNum=30&a=195105936)[http://stockcharts.com/school/data/m...-1-spyexam.png](http://stockcharts.com/school/data/media/chart_school/technical_indicators_and_overlays/bollinger_bands/bbs-1-spyexam.png)   
  
Settings can be adjusted to suit the characteristics of particular securities or trading styles. Bollinger recommends making small incremental adjustments to the standard deviation multiplier. Changing the number of periods for the moving average also affects the number of periods used to calculate the standard deviation. Therefore, only small adjustments are required for the standard deviation **multiplier**. An increase in the moving average period would automatically increase the number of periods used to calculate the standard deviation and would also warrant an increase in the standard deviation **multiplier**. With a 20-day SMA and 20-day Standard Deviation, the standard deviation multiplier is set at 2. Bollinger suggests increasing the standard deviation multiplier to 2.1 for a 50-period SMA and decreasing the standard deviation multiplier to 1.9 for a 10-period SMA.   
  
**Signal: W-Bottoms**  
  
W-Bottoms were part of Arthur Merrill's work that identified 16 patterns with a basic W shape. Bollinger uses these various W patterns with Bollinger Bands to identify W-Bottoms. A "W-Bottom" forms in a downtrend and involves two reaction lows. In particular, Bollinger looks for W-Bottoms where the second low is lower than the first, but holds above the lower band. There are four steps to confirm a W-Bottom with Bollinger Bands. First, a reaction low forms. This low is usually, but not always, below the lower band. Second, there is a bounce towards the middle band. Third, there is a new price low in the security this low holds **above** the lower band. The ability to hold above the lower band on the test shows less weakness on the last decline. Fourth, the pattern is confirmed with a strong move off the second low and a resistance break.

Chart 2 shows Nordstrom (JWN) with a W-Bottom in January-February 2010. First, the stock formed a reaction low in January (black arrow) and broke below the lower band. Second, there was a bounce back above the middle band. Third, the stock moved below its January low and held above the lower band. Even though the 5-Feb spike low broke the lower band, Bollinger Bands are calculated using closing prices so signals should also be based on closing prices. Fourth, the stock surged with expanding volume in late February and broke above the early February high. Chart 3 shows Sandisk with a smaller W-Bottom in July-August 2009.

**Signal: M-Tops**  
  
M-Tops were also part of Arthur Merrills work that identified 16 patterns with a basic M shape. Bollinger uses these various M patterns with Bollinger Bands to identify M Bottoms. According to Bollinger, tops are usually more complicated and drawn out than bottoms. Double tops, head-and-shoulders patterns and diamonds represent evolving tops.

Follow-up:  
http://stockcharts.com/help/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:bollinger_bands  
  
In its most basic form, an M-Top is similar to a double top. However, the reaction highs are not always equal. The first high can be higher or lower than the second high. Bollinger suggests looking for signs of non-confirmation when a security is making new highs. This is basically the opposite of the W-Bottom. A non-confirmation occurs with three steps. First, a security forges a reaction high above the upper band. Second, there is a pullback towards the middle band. Third, prices move above the prior high, but fail to reach the upper band. This is a warning sign. The inability of the second reaction high to reach the upper band shows waning momentum, which can foreshadow a trend reversal. Final confirmation comes with a support break or bearish indicator signal.

Chart 4 shows Exxon Mobil (XOM) with an M-Top in April-May 2008. The stock moved above the upper band in April. There was a pullback in May and then another push above 90. Even though the stock moved above the upper band on an intraday basis, it did not CLOSE above the upper band. The M-Top was confirmed with a support break two weeks later. Also notice that MACD formed a bearish divergence and moved below its signal line for confirmation.   
  
[](http://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=PHM&p=D&st=2008-07-01&en=2008-11-31&id=p38553429458&listNum=30&a=200099682)[http://stockcharts.com/school/data/m...-5-phmmtop.png](http://stockcharts.com/school/data/media/chart_school/technical_indicators_and_overlays/bollinger_bands/bbs-5-phmmtop.png)   
  
Chart 5 shows Pulte Homes (PHM) within an uptrend in July-August 2008. Price exceeded the upper band in early September to affirm the uptrend. After a pullback below the 20-day SMA (middle Bollinger Band), the stock moved to a higher high above 17. Despite this new high for the move, price did not exceed the upper band. This flashed a warning sign. The stock broke support a week later and MACD moved below its signal line. Notice that this M-top is more complex because there are lower reaction highs on either side of the peak (blue arrow). This evolving top formed a small head-and-shoulders pattern.   
  
**Signal: Walking the Bands**  
  
Moves above or below the bands are not signals per se. As Bollinger puts it, moves that touch or exceed the bands are not signals, but rather "tags". On the face of it, a move to the upper band shows strength, while a sharp move to the lower band shows weakness. Momentum oscillators work much the same way. Overbought is not necessarily bullish. It takes strength to reach overbought levels and overbought conditions can extend in a strong uptrend. Similarly, prices can "walk the band" with numerous touches during a strong uptrend. Think about it for a moment. The upper band is 2 standard deviations above the 20-period simple moving average. It takes a pretty strong price move to exceed this upper band. An upper band touch that occurs after a Bollinger Band confirmed W-Bottom would signal the start of an uptrend. Just as a strong uptrend produces numerous upper band tags, it is also common for prices to never reach the lower band during an uptrend. The 20-day SMA sometimes acts as support. In fact, dips below the 20-day SMA sometimes provide buying opportunities before the next tag of the upper band.   
  
[](http://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=APD&p=D&st=2009-06-01&en=2010-01-01&id=p56146169017&listNum=30&a=200194345)[http://stockcharts.com/school/data/m...-6-apdwalk.png](http://stockcharts.com/school/data/media/chart_school/technical_indicators_and_overlays/bollinger_bands/bbs-6-apdwalk.png)   
  
Chart 6 shows Air Products (APD) with a surge and close above the upper band in mid July. First, notice that this is a strong surge that broke above two resistance levels. A strong upward thrust is a sign of strength, not weakness. Trading turned flat in August and the 20-day SMA moved sideways. The Bollinger Bands narrowed, but APD did not close below the lower band. Prices, and the 20-day SMA, turned up in September. Overall, APD closed above the upper band at least five times over a four month period. The indicator window shows the 10-period Commodity Channel Index (CCI). Dips below -100 are deemed oversold and moves back above -100 signal the start of an oversold bounce (green dotted line). The upper band tag and breakout started the uptrend. CCI then identified tradable pullbacks with dips below -100. This is an example of combining Bollinger Bands with a momentum oscillator for trading signals.   
  
[](http://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=MON&p=D&st=2009-11-30&en=2010-05-11&id=p40611210370&listNum=30&a=200194979)[http://stockcharts.com/school/data/m...-7-monwalk.png](http://stockcharts.com/school/data/media/chart_school/technical_indicators_and_overlays/bollinger_bands/bbs-7-monwalk.png)   
  
Chart 7 shows Monsanto (MON) with a walk down the lower band. The stock broke down in January with a support break and closed below the lower band. From mid January until early May, Monsanto closed below the lower band at least five times. Notice that the stock did not close above the upper band once during this period. The support break and initial close below the lower band signaled a downtrend. As such, the 10-period Commodity Channel Index (CCI) was used to identify short-term overbought situations. A move above +100 is overbought. A move back below +100 signals a resumption of the downtrend (red arrows). This system triggered two good signals in early 2010.   
  
**Conclusions**  
  
Bollinger Bands reflect direction with the 20-period SMA and volatility with the upper/lower bands. As such, they can be used to determine if prices are relatively high or low. According to Bollinger, the bands should contain 88-89% of price action, which makes a move outside the bands significant. Technically, prices are relatively high when above the upper band and relatively low when below the lower band. However, relatively high should not be regarded as bearish or as a sell signal. Likewise, relatively low should not be considered bullish or as a buy signal. Prices are high or low for a reason. As with other indicators, Bollinger Bands are not meant to be used as a stand alone tool. Chartists should combine Bollinger Bands with basic trend analysis and other indicators for confirmation.   
  
**Bands and SharpCharts**  
  
Bollinger Bands can be found in SharpCharts as a price overlay. As with a simple moving average, Bollinger Bands should be shown on top of a price plot. Upon selecting Bollinger Bands, the default setting will appear in the parameters window (20,2). The first number (20) sets the periods for the simple moving average and the standard deviation. The second number (2) sets the standard deviation multiplier for the upper and lower bands. These default parameters set the bands 2 standard deviations above/below the simple moving average. Users can change the parameters to suit their charting needs. Bollinger Bands (50,2.1) can be used for a longer timeframe or Bollinger Bands (10,1.9) can be used for a shorter timeframe.

This classic covers Bollinger Bands, Bollinger BandWidth, %B, the 32 patterns of Arthur Merrill and more. Bollinger also shows how to use Bollinger Bands to generate signals with other indicators.

Hello mrhb30jr  
  
Great chart! I like it!  
Besides pin bars you could take a look at inside bars, too, (which "bit9ret" has introduced at p.25, #[**371**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3976159&postcount=371); p.25, #[**375**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3976320&postcount=375)) as a confirmation to the pin bars (e.g. hammers and shooting stars, may be hanging man, too), at least you've got one more powerful argument in addition.   
  
H4 candles have forming a bullish engulfing pattern.   
I would prefere with Enter Long at 1.013 with 3 positions* and then with 3 more positions at 1.00. If price are falling under 1.0 Enter Long with 2 more positions and around 0.98 with 2 positions, or so.  
  
If the actual last H4 candle (spinning top) turned further downwards (and not over the the middle line of Bollinger Band),... it don't confirm the bullish engulfing pattern, ...you could hedge some positions downwards at a lower timeframe (M15/M30) by holding the Enter Long trades in the market. So would I do!   
  
Lowest price (monthly chart) was at 0.96380 at 2008.03.01. Between 0.98 and 0.965 again with several positions Enter Long (max. 5-10) even more to pick up the higher chance of a turn around.  
  
If so there would be 1.5 to 2 full trades in the market (1.5 - 2 Lot, say 15 - 20 positions).  
  
*Position trading  
If a trade would be 1 Lot so divide it by 10 and these are the positions.  
1 Lot = 10 positions.  
  
Hope it helps!  
  
Sincerely,  
FXcube

Here you see when you don't trade with Stop Loss a worse scenario snapshot.  
  
You'll see that in the next weeks all open trades will running in the win, may be tomorrow, may be next week, may be next month, we don't know! It's only the drawback of my art of Non-Stop-Loss Trading, which you make allowance for the money management. Sure, I have to go with some hedging positions at short term charts down. But this is also for demonstrating. May be the end of the losses aren't reached and if no hedging ones would be made then further minus floating could follow. I have a great trust in my own market analysis and in my unorthodox money and risk management. So for me it's okay!,...may be not for you. That is the point who every forex trader have to trade in his own characteristic, and it would be fine when you will work out yours!  
  
Interim Result:  
Floating Loss : -17'025.55$  
  
History file, see attachment, please.  
  
Kindest regards

With this "Floating Loss : -17'025.55$" \- Example I will demonstrade that 95-99% of all open trades would run in his win sooner or later and a part of this would several times hedged. So I ask you "Why should you destroy these open losses trades with a stop loss too early?" Make really no sense for me! You give too early good money your broker!, ...moreover ...and abdicate responsibility to early. I wouldn't do so.  
  
Sequentially I assess the value of the following comments as useless and misleading.  
  
_"Limit your losses  
Stop/loss commands also follow the same motive as that of the limit orders, by allowing the investors to set an exit point for a loss. By limiting your losses to a pre set position, Stop/loss orders help investors control their risk conditions. By placing them well in advance, you have an almost accurate idea of how much in loss will you be, in case the stop/loss order is hit!"_  
  
When I read such nonsense I can only say:  
  
Oh snap!

95-99% of all the open minus trades ("Floating Loss : -17'025.55$") are Tops and wait for their transfer in the break even area!

I use this Non Stop Loss Concept in association with the Position Trading, an incremental representation by 10.  
  
Example: Someone deals ordinary with 1 Lot per trade. So this trade has now 10 positions and he have to go in the trade now e.g. with two tenths or three tenth of its normal size, say only with 2 - 3 positions.

Both new and experienced traders make good and bad trades over a long period of time. The difference between them is that the more experienced trader has a grasp of the importance of risk management as an integral part of a successful Forex trading strategy.

Proper risk management can maximize the positive and minimize the negative aspects of the regular ups and downs of trading.  
  
  
_...and this means for me a trading without stopp loss!_

Risk Management in Forex Trading is recommended for traders who like the Stop Loss Trading Style.  
  
http://www.wikinvest.com/wiki/Risk_Management_in_Forex_Trading  
  
Risk Management in Forex Trading  
  
Even the best trading strategy can falter from time to time, however, without good risk management, a small loss could turn into an account-ending margin call. Risk Management simply refers to any effort taken to mitigate uncertainty in a trade.   
**Know Your Exit Even Before You Enter**  
  
From the collective wisdom of the market, one rule always seems to top the list of essential money management commandments: placing stops. A stop loss is merely a level at which a trader will exit a trade that is going against them. This level can be mental or a hard stop—with an order set to automatically exit when spot reaches a certain price. In general, a hard stop will almost always be preferable as it removes the hazard of emotion seeping into a trade and adjusting an otherwise sound trading strategy. However, there are situations where the mental component can be useful. There are two core types of stops in the forex market - 

  1. Money stop
  2. Indicator stop.

**Money Stop**  
  
The money stop is the most commonly used exit strategy in the investment world. This level is based on a predefined amount of capital a trader is willing to risk on each trade. By deciding how much a trade could potentially lose at the outset, a market participant can survive to trade another day should one position fail. While this stop is primarily calculated as a specific percentage of total capital, or perhaps it is chosen as just a random number, we can also take technicals into consideration when defining the exit level. To show how all of this comes together, we can take as an example a hypothetical trade in EUR/USD. With a bullish outlook on the pair, we could have entered the market when price was testing a rising trendline around 1.5525. With a predetermined level of acceptable risk of 150 pips or $1,500 for a standard account[[1]](http://www.wikinvest.com/wiki/Risk_Management_in_Forex_Trading#_note-DailyFX), we would set our stop at 1.5375[[1]](http://www.wikinvest.com/wiki/Risk_Management_in_Forex_Trading#_note-DailyFX)—well below the rising trendline.

](http://www.wikinvest.com/image/Risk_Management.png)  
  
Entry and Indicator Stop  
  
  
  
**Indicator Stop**  
  
Another popular exit strategy is the indicator stop. Unlike the other two stops, which rely predominately on underlying price action, this method uses a technical indicator, alone or in conjunction with spot, to define an exit. This can entail an indicator reaching a certain level, two indicators crossing, or price action interacting with the indicator as a means for gauging an exit point. heoretically, there are unlimited possibilities for incorporating technicals into a stop policy—ranging from very complicated to extremely simple. One of the most common indicator stops for nearly every market is using a moving average as a self-adjusted stop loss. Here is an example of using the 100-hour SMA as an exit tool for the EUR/USD. Suppose a trader goes long the EUR/USD on a close above the 100-hour SMA. The trader can then proceed to trail the stop using the moving average and only exit the position when price closes back below the SMA. In this example, the long trade is taken at 1.55 and not closed until 1.5750[[1]](http://www.wikinvest.com/wiki/Risk_Management_in_Forex_Trading#_note-DailyFX). The only caveat is that this method of a stop does not work well with set orders, so the trader will need to keep an eye on the technical indicator.

](http://www.wikinvest.com/image/RiskManagement2.png)  
  
Having a stop and sticking with it is the most fundamental rule of trading that separates disciplined traders from undisciplined ones.  
  
  
Good Luck!

Understanding Forex Risk Management   
  
by Selwyn Gishen ([Contact Author](http://www.investopedia.com/contact.aspx?ContentType=A&Subject=Investopedia%20Contact%20Form&ContentID=5931) | [Biography](http://www.investopedia.com/contributors/default.aspx?id=216))  
Trading is the exchange of goods or services between two or more parties. So if you need gasoline for your car, then you would trade your dollars for gasoline. In the old days, and still in some societies, trading was done by barter, where one commodity was swapped for another. A trade may have gone like this: Person A will fix Person B's broken window in exchange for a basket of apples from Person B's tree. This is a practical, easy to manage, day-to-day example of making a trade, with relatively easy management of risk. In order to lessen the risk, Person A might ask Person B to show his apples, to make sure they are good to eat, before fixing the window. This is how trading has been for millennia: a practical, thoughtful human process.  
  
  
**This is Now**  
Now enter the world wide web and all of a sudden risk can become completely out of control, in part due to the speed at which a transaction can take place. In fact, the speed of the transaction, the instant gratification and the adrenalin rush of making a profit in less than 60 seconds can often trigger a gambling instinct, to which many traders may succumb. Hence, they might turn to online trading as a form of gambling rather than approaching trading as a professional business that requires proper speculative habits. (Learn more in [_Are You Investing Or Gambling?_](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/10/investing-or-gambling.asp))  
  
Speculating as a trader is not gambling. The difference between gambling and speculating is risk management. In other words, with speculating, you have some kind of control over your risk, whereas with gambling you don't. Even a card game such as Poker can be played with either the mindset of a gambler or with the mindset of a speculator, usually with totally different outcomes. **  
  
Betting Strategies  
**There are three basic ways to take a bet: [Martingale](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/martingalesystem.asp), [anti-Martingale](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/antimartingale.asp) or speculative. Speculation comes from the Latin word "speculari," meaning to spy out or look forward.  
  
In a Martingale strategy, you would double-up your bet each time you lose, and hope that eventually the losing streak will end and you will make a favorable bet, thereby recovering all your losses and even making a small profit.  
  
Using an anti-Martingale strategy, you would halve your bets each time you lost, but would double your bets each time you won. This theory assumes that you can capitalize on a winning streak and profit accordingly. Clearly, for online traders, this is the better of the two strategies to adopt. It is always less risky to take your losses quickly and add or increase your trade size when you are winning.  
However, no trade should be taken without first stacking the odds in your favor, and if this is not clearly possible then no trade should be taken at all. (For more on the Martingale method, read [_FX Trading The Martingale Way_](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/06/martingale.asp).)  
  
**Know the Odds**  
So, the first rule in risk management is to calculate the odds of your trade being successful. To do that, you need to grasp both fundamental and [technical analysis](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalanalysis.asp). You will need to understand the dynamics of the market in which you are trading, and also know where the likely psychological price trigger points are, which a price chart can help you decide.  
Once a decision is made to take the trade then the next most important factor is in how you control or manage the risk. Remember, if you can measure the risk, you can, for the most part, manage it.  
In stacking the odds in your favor, it is important to draw a line in the sand, which will be your cut out point if the market trades to that level. The difference between this cut-out point and where you enter the market is your risk. Psychologically, you must accept this risk upfront before you even take the trade. If you can accept the potential loss, and you are OK with it, then you can consider the trade further. If the loss will be too much for you to bear, then you must not take the trade or else you will be severely stressed and unable to be objective as your trade proceeds.  
Since risk is the opposite side of the coin to reward, you should draw a second line in the sand, which is where, if the market trades to that point, you will move your original cut-out line to secure your position. This is known as sliding your stops. This second line is the price at which you break even if the market cuts you out at that point. Once you are protected by a break-even stop, your risk has virtually been reduced to zero, as long as the market is very liquid and you know your trade will be executed at that price. Make sure you understand the difference between stop orders, limit orders and market orders.  
  
**Liquidity  
**The next risk factor to study is [liquidity](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp). Liquidity means that there are a sufficient number of buyers and sellers at current prices to easily and efficiently take your trade. In the case of the forex markets, liquidity, at least in the major currencies, is never a problem. This liquidity is known as market liquidity, and in the spot cash forex market, it [accounts](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/10/forex-risk-management.asp#) for some $2 trillion per day in trading volume.  
However, this liquidity is not necessarily available to all brokers and is not the same in all currency pairs. It is really the broker liquidity that will affect you as a trader. Unless you trade directly with a large forex dealing [bank](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/10/forex-risk-management.asp#), you most likely will need to rely on an online broker to hold your account and to execute your trades accordingly. Questions relating to broker risk are beyond the scope of this article, but large, well-known and well capitalized brokers should be fine for most retail online traders, at least in terms of having sufficient liquidity to effectively execute your trade.  
  
**Risk per Trade  
**Another aspect of risk is determined by how much trading [capital](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/10/forex-risk-management.asp#) you have available. Risk per trade should always be a small percentage of your total capital. A good starting percentage could be 2% of your available trading capital. So, for example, if you have $5000 in your account, the maximum loss allowable should be no more than 2%. With these parameters your maximum loss would be $100 per trade. A 2% loss per trade would mean you can be wrong 50 times in a row before you wipe out your account. This is an unlikely scenario if you have a proper system for stacking the odds in your favor.   
So how do we actually measure the risk?  
The way to measure risk per trade is by using your price chart. This is best demonstrated by looking at a chart as follows:   
  
[http://i.investopedia.com/inv/articl.../RiskMGMT1.gif](http://i.investopedia.com/inv/articles/site/RiskMGMT1.gif)   
Figure 1: EUR/USD One-Hour Time Frame Chart by Netdania.com   
  
We have already determined that our first line in the sand ([stop loss](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stop-lossorder.asp)) should be drawn where we would cut out of the position if the market traded to this level. The line is set at 1.3534. To give the market a little room, I would set the stop loss to 1.3530. (Learn more about stop losses in _[The Art Of Selling A Losing Position](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/02/022002.asp)._) A good place to enter the position would be at 1.3580, which, in this example, is just above the high of the hourly close after a an attempt to form a triple bottom failed. The difference between this entry point and the exit point is therefore 50 pips. If you are trading with $5,000 in your [account](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/10/forex-risk-management.asp#), you would limit your loss to the 2% of your trading capital, which is $100.  
Let's assume you are trading [mini lots](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mini-lot.asp). If one pip in a mini lot is equal to approximately $1 and your risk is 50 pips then, for each lot you trade, you are risking $50. You could trade one or two mini lots and keep your risk to between $50-100. You should not trade more than three mini lots in this example, if you do not wish to violate your 2% rule.  
  
**Leverage  
**The next big risk magnifier is [leverage](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverage.asp). Leverage is the use of the bank's or broker's money rather than the strict use of your own. The spot forex market is a very leveraged market, in that you could put down a deposit of just $1,000 to actually trade $100,000. This is a 100:1 leverage factor. A one pip loss in a 100:1 leveraged situation is equal to $10. So if you had 10 mini lots in the trade, and you lost 50 pips, your loss would be $500, not $50.  
However, one of the big benefits of trading the spot forex markets is the availability of high leverage. This high leverage is available because the market is so liquid that it is easy to cut out of a position very quickly and, therefore, easier compared with most other markets to manage leveraged positions. Leverage of course cuts two ways. If you are leveraged and you make a profit, your returns are magnified very quickly but, in the converse, losses will erode your account just as quickly too. (See _[Leverage's "Double-Edged Sword" Need Not Cut Deep](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/08/forex-leverage.asp)_ for more.)  
But of all the risks inherent in a trade, the hardest risk to manage, and by far the most common risk blamed for trader loss, is the bad habit patterns of the trader himself.  
All traders have to take responsibility for their own decisions. In trading, losses are part of the norm, so a trader must learn to accept losses as part of the process. Losses are not failures. However, not taking a loss quickly is a failure of proper trade management. Usually a trader, when his position moves into a loss, will second guess his system and wait for the loss to turn around and for the position to become profitable. This is fine for those occasions when the market does turn around, but it can be a disaster when the loss gets worse. (Learn to overcome this big hurdle in _[Master Your Trading Mindtraps](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/07/trading_mindtraps.asp)._)  
  
The solution to trader risk is to work on your own habits and to be honest enough to acknowledge the times when your ego gets in the way of making the right decisions or when you simply can't manage the instinctive pull of a bad habit.  
The best way to objectify your trading is by keeping a journal of each trade, noting the reasons for entry and exit and keeping score of how effective your system is. In other words how confident are you that your system provides a reliable method in stacking the odds in your favor and thus provide you with more profitable trade opportunities than potential losses.  
  
**Conclusion**  
Risk is inherent in every trade you take, but as long as you can measure risk you can manage it. Just don't overlook the fact that risk can be magnified by using too much leverage in respect to your trading capital as well as being magnified by a lack of liquidity in the market. With a disciplined approach and good trading habits, taking on some risk is the only way to generate good rewards.

AUDUSD, H4, 2010 September 09  
  
I take a look at M15 is at 0.9173 murrey math "Overshoot level" [+1/8] at the moment, see #[**513**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4007421&postcount=513), please.  
  
...and Enter Short with 3 positions at 0.9175 just now.  
  
Market price could go further up till 0.927 - 0.976.   
  
So I prefere to set several pending orders in between this upper band.

Forex risk management strategies   
Learn about the basic strategies for controlling risks while trading Forex  
The Forex market behaves differently from other markets! The speed, volatility, and enormous size of the Forex market are unlike anything else in the financial world. Beware: the Forex market is uncontrollable - no single event, individual, or factor rules it. Enjoy trading in the perfect market! Just like any other speculative business, increased risk entails chances for a higher profit/loss.  
Currency markets are highly speculative and volatile in nature. Any currency can become very expensive or very cheap in relation to any or all other currencies in a matter of days, hours, or sometimes, in minutes. This unpredictable nature of the currencies is what attracts an investor to trade and invest in the currency market.  
But ask yourself, "How much am I ready to lose?" When you terminated, closed or exited your position, had you had understood the risks and taken steps to avoid them? Let's look at some foreign exchange risk management issues that may come up in your day-to-day foreign exchange transactions.

  1. Unexpected corrections in currency exchange rates
  2. Wild variations in foreign exchange rates
  3. Volatile markets offering profit opportunities
  4. Lost payments
  5. Delayed confirmation of payments and receivables
  6. Divergence between bank drafts received and the contract price

  
There are areas that every trader should cover both BEFORE and DURING a trade.  
Exit the Forex market at profit targetsLimit orders, also known as profit take orders, allow Forex traders to exit the Forex market at pre-determined profit targets. If you are short (sold) a currency pair, the system will only allow you to place a limit order below the current market price because this is the profit zone. Similarly, if you are long (bought) the currency pair, the system will only allow you to place a limit order above the current market price. Limit orders help create a disciplined trading methodology and make it possible for traders to walk away from the computer without continuously monitoring the market.  
Control risk by capping lossesStop/loss orders allow traders to set an exit point for a losing trade. If you are short a currency pair, the stop/loss order should be placed above the current market price. If you are long the currency pair, the stop/loss order should be placed below the current market price. Stop/loss orders help traders control risk by capping losses. Stop/loss orders are counter-intuitive because you do not want them to be hit; however, you will be happy that you placed them! When logic dictates, you can control greed.  
Where should I place my stop and limit orders?As a general rule of thumb, traders should set stop/loss orders closer to the opening price than limit orders. If this rule is followed, a trader needs to be right less than 50% of the time to be profitable. For example, a trader that uses a 30 pip stop/loss and 100-pip limit orders, needs only to be right 1/3 of the time to make a profit. Where the trader places the stop and limit will depend on how risk-adverse he is. Stop/loss orders should not be so tight that normal market volatility triggers the order. Similarly, limit orders should reflect a realistic expectation of gains based on the market's trading activity and the length of time one wants to hold the position. In initially setting up and establishing the trade, the trader should look to change the stop loss and set it at a rate in the 'middle ground' where they are not overexposed to the trade, and at the same time, not too close to the market.  
Trading foreign currencies is a demanding and potentially profitable opportunity for trained and experienced investors. However, before deciding to participate in the Forex market, you should soberly reflect on the desired result of your investment and your level of experience. Warning! Do not invest money you cannot afford to lose.  
So, there is significant risk in any foreign exchange deal. Any transaction involving currencies involves risks including, but not limited to, the potential for changing political and/or economic conditions, that may substantially affect the price or liquidity of a currency.  
Moreover, the leveraged nature of FX trading means that any market movement will have an equally proportional effect on your deposited funds. This may work against you as well as for you. The possibility exists that you could sustain a total loss of your initial margin funds and be required to deposit additional funds to maintain your position. If you fail to meet any margin call within the time prescribed, your position will be liquidated and you will be responsible for any resulting losses. 'Stop-loss' or 'limit' order strategies may lower an investor's exposure to risk.  
Easy-Forex foreign exchange technology links around-the-clock to the world's foreign currency exchange trading floors to get the lowest foreign currency rates and to take every opportunity to make or settle a transaction.  
Avoiding/lowering risk when trading Forex:Trade like a technical analyst. Understanding the fundamentals behind an investment also requires understanding the technical analysis method. When your fundamental and technical signals point to the same direction, you have a good chance to have a successful trade, especially with good money management skills. Use simple support and resistance technical analysis, Fibonacci Retracement and reversal days. Be disciplined. Create a position and understand your reasons for having that position, and establish stop loss and profit taking levels. Discipline includes hitting your stops and not following the temptation to stay with a losing position that has gone through your stop/loss level. When you buy, buy high. When you sell, sell higher. Similarly, when you sell, sell low. When you buy, buy lower. Rule of thumb: In a bull market, be long or neutral - in a bear market, be short or neutral. If you forget this rule and trade against the trend, you will usually cause yourself to suffer psychological worries, and frequently, losses. And never add to a losing position. On Easy-Forex the trader can change their trade orders as many times as they wish free of charge, either as a stop loss or as a take profit. The trader can also close the trade manually without a stop loss or profit take order being hit. Many successful traders set their stop loss price beyond the rate at which they made the trade so that the worst that can happen is that they get stopped out and make a profit.

**Stop-loss orders:** This is minimizing [risk](http://all-about-forextrading.com/risks-in-forex-trading.html) when placing an entry order. A stop-loss order gives instructions to exit your position if the currency price reaches a certain point. If you take a short position (expecting the price to fall) you would place a stop loss order above current market price. If you take a long position (expecting the price to rise) you would place a stop loss order below current market price.   
_Let's take for an example, you take a short position on USD/CDN, this means that you expect the US dollar to fall against the Canadian dollar. Let's take for an example also that the quote is USD/CDN 1.2138/43 - you can sell US$1 for 1.2138 CDN dollars or sell 1.2143 CDN dollars for US$1. You can then place an order like this: Sell USD: 1 standard lot USD/CDN @ 1.2138 = $121,380 CDN Pip Value: 1 pip = $10 Stop-Loss: 1.2148 Margin: $1,000 (1%)_  
_You are selling US$100,000 and buying CDN$121,380. Your stop loss order will be executed if the dollar goes above 1.2148, in which case you will lose $100. However, USD/CDN falls to 1.2118/23. You can now sell $1 US for 1.2118 CDN or sell 1.2123 CDN for $1 US._  
_Because you entered the transaction by selling US dollars (buying short), you must now buy back US dollars and sell CDN dollars to realize your profit. You buy back US$100,000 at the current USD/CDN rate of 1.2123 for a cost of 121,223 CDN._  
_Since you originally sold them for CDN$121,380 you made a profit of $157 Canadian dollars or US$129.51 (157 divided by the current exchange rate of 1.2123).

Money Management  
This section is one of the most important sections you will ever read about trading.   
Why is it important? Well, we are in the business of making money, and in order to make money we have to learn how to manage it. Ironically, this is one of the most overlooked areas in trading. Many traders are just anxious to get right into trading with no regards to their total account size. They simply determine how much they can stomach to lose in a single trade and hit the “trade” button. There’s a term for this type of investing….it’s called GAMBLING!  
When you trade without money management rules, you are in fact gambling. You are not looking at the long term return on your investment. Instead you are only looking for that “jackpot”. Money management rules will not only protect us, but they will make us very profitable in the long run. If you don’t believe me, and you think that “gambling” is the way to get rich, then consider this example:  
People go to Las Vegas all the time to gamble their money in hopes to win a big jackpot, and in fact, many people _do_ win. So how in the world, are casino’s still making money if many individuals are winning jackpots? The answer is that while even though people win jackpots, in the long run, casino’s are still profitable because they rake in more money from the people that _don’t_ win. That is where the term “the house always wins” comes from.   
The truth is that casinos are just very rich statisticians. They know that in the long run, they will be the ones making the money—not the gamblers. Even if Joe Schmoe wins $100,000 jackpot in a slot machine, the casinos know that there will be 100 more gamblers who WON’T win that jackpot and the money will go right back in their pockets.  
  
This is a classic example of how statisticians make money over gamblers. Even though both lose money, the statistician, or casino in this case, knows how to control their losses. Essentially, this is how money management works.If you learn how to control your losses, you will have a chance at being profitable.  
You want to be the rich statistician…NOT the gambler because in the long run, you want to “always be the winner.”   
So how do you become this rich statistician instead of a loser?

Drawdown and Maximum Drawdown?  
  
So we know that [money management](http://www.babypips.com/school/money_management.html) will make us money in the long run, but now we’d like to show you the other side of things. What would happen if you didn’t use money management rules?   
Consider this example:   
Let’s say you have a $100,000 and you lose $50,000. What percentage of your account have you lost? The answer is 50%. Simple enough. Now, what percentage of that $50,000 do you have to make in order to get back to your original $100,000? It’s not 50%--you’d have to make back 100% of your $50,000 to get back to your original $100,000. This is called drawdown. For this example, we would’ve had a 50% drawdown.   
The point of that little illustration is that it is very easy to lose money and a lot harder to make it back. We know you’re saying to yourself, “I’m not going to lose 50% of my account in one trade.” Well we would certainly hope not!   
However, what if you lost 3, 4, or even 10 trades in a row? That couldn’t possibly happen to you, right? (Sarcasm used) You have a [trading system](http://www.babypips.com/school/can_you_handle_the_truth.html) that wins 70% of the time, so there is NO way you could lose 10 trades in a row. (Even more sarcasm used)   
Well, while you may have a good system, consider this example:   
In trading, we are always looking for an edge. That is the whole reason why traders develop systems. A trading system that is 70% profitable sounds like a very good edge to have. But just because your trading system is 70% profitable, does that mean for every 100 trades you make, you will win 7 out of every 10?   
  
**Losing Streak**  
  
Not necessarily! How do you know which 70 out of those 100 trades will be winners?   
The answer is that you don’t. You could lose the first 30 trades in a row and win the remaining 70. That would still give you a 70% profitable system, but you have to ask yourself, “Would you still be in the game if you lost 30 trades in a row?”   
This is why money management is so important. No matter what system you use, you will eventually have a losing streak. Even professional poker players who make their living through poker go through horrible losing streaks, and yet they still end up profitable.   
  
The reason is that the good poker players practice money management because they know that they will not win every tournament they play. Instead, they only risk a small percentage of their total bankroll so that they can survive those losing streaks.   
This is what you must do as a trader. Only risk a small percentage of your “trading bankroll” so that you can survive your losing streaks. Remember that if you practice strict money management rules, you will become the casino and in the long run, “you will always win.”  
Let me illustrate what happens when you use proper money management and when you don't...

Don't Lose Your Shirt  
  
Here is a little illustration that will show you the difference between risking a small percentage of your capital compared to risking a higher percentage.   
  

[http://www.babypips.com/images/money...management.gif](http://www.babypips.com/images/money-management/money-management.gif)

  
You can see that there is a big difference between risking 2% of your account compared to risking 10% of your account on a single trade. If you happened to go through a losing streak and lost only 19 trades in a row, you would’ve went from starting with $20,000 to having only $3,002 left if you risked 10% on each trade. You would’ve lost over 85% of your account! If you risked only 2% you would’ve still had $13,903 which is only a 30% loss of your total account.   
Of course, the last thing we want to do is lose 19 trades in a row, but even if you only lost 5 trades in a row, look at the difference between risking 2% and 10%. If you risked 2% you would still have $18,447. If you risked 10% you would only have $13,122. That’s less than what you would’ve had even if you lost all 19 trades and risked only 2% of your account!  
  
The point of this illustration is that you want to setup your [money management](http://www.babypips.com/school/money_management.html) rules so that when you do have a [drawdown period](http://www.babypips.com/school/drawdown_and_maximum_drawdown.html) (losing streak) you will still have enough capital to stay in the game. Can you imagine if you lost 85% of your account? You would have to make 566% on what you are left with in order to get back to break even. Trust me, you do NOT want to be in that position. In fact, here is a chart that will illustrate what percentage you would have to make to breakeven if you were to lose a certain percentage of your account.  
  

[http://www.babypips.com/images/money...ement/loss.gif](http://www.babypips.com/images/money-management/loss.gif)

  
You can see that the more you lose, the harder it is to make it back to your original account size. This is all the more reason that you should do everything you can to protect your account.  
So by now, I hope you have gotten it drilled in your head that you should only risk a small percentage of your account in each trade so that you can survive your losing streaks and also to avoid a large drawdown in your account. Remember, you want to be the casino…NOT the gambler!

Risk to Reward  
  
Another way you can increase your chances of profitability is to trade when you have the potential to make 3 times more than you are risking. If you give yourself a 3:1 reward/risk ratio, you have a significantly greater chance of ending up profitable in the long run. Take a look at this chart as an example:  
  
  

[http://www.babypips.com/images/money...-to-reward.gif](http://www.babypips.com/images/money-management/risk-to-reward.gif)

  
  
In this example, you can see that even if you only won 50% of your trades, you would still make a profit of $10,000. Just remember that whenever you trade with a good risk to reward ratio, your chances of being profitable are much greater even if you have a lower win percentage.

****Summary of Money Management  
  
**Be the casino, not the gambler!** Remember, casinos are just very rich statisticians!  
[Drawdown](http://www.babypips.com/school/drawdown_and_maximum_drawdown.html) is a reality and WILL happen to you at some point. The less you [risk](http://www.babypips.com/school/dont_lose_your_shirt.html) in a trade, the less your maximum drawdown will be.   
The more you lose in your account, the harder it is to make it back to breakeven.  
Trade only a small percentage of your account. The smaller the better. 3% or less is recommended.  
It is desirable to trade when you have a high [risk to reward ratio](http://www.babypips.com/school/risk_to_reward.html). The higher the ratio, the less you have to be right.

Hi mrhb30jr  
  
Very great charts which you post here. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
Get on with it!  
  
Uncomplicated, straightforward market analysis? Really excellent. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
Congratulation!![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
Now to your request:  
  
I would go down at 1256.20 with Gold and Silver 20.01, too,... just now and would earn the carry trades in long term. (Monthly chart Silver till 9./11, Gold 680/740) with several position, ...and would trade besides with other positions the ups and downs at H4/Daily.  
  
May be hedging the monthly positions at H4 if prices would run steep upwards.   
  
Sincerely  
FXcube

Be aware that USDCHF could move down till 0.95 - 0.99 (monthly chart), ...may be entertaining more.  
  
I trade also H1/H4,... and set my Long Term Trades Enter Long between 1.00 - 1.012  
  
Kindest regards

Hello mrhb30jr  
  
For a detailed market analysis I need more information, e.g. monthly, weekly and daily chart.  
  
Only H4:  
The white "Line B" from August 03 was broken downside. May be it could be a higher probability for further down, if price action won't tell the other thing. Next Support level could be "Support line A" and here I would trade a little M1/M5/M15 till up- or downside movements will getting clearer.  
  
May be you could post here the Daily and Weekly and Monthly chart net...  
  
Kindest regards  
Fxcube

When I can read articles like this below, it's really time to enter short and trade the opposite.   
  
http://www.thestreet.com/story/10854733/1/gold-prices-break-to-new-highs.html  
"The World Gold Council said in its second-quarter Gold Demand Trends report that the supply of gold grew 17% from a year earlier while gold demand grew 36%. Turk is looking for $1,800 to $2,000 gold this year. Based on these prices, he doesn't believe it's too late to dollar-cost average and buy gold every quarter."  
  
When Gold price has reached its top and highest resistance levels, often you can read comments like this above in constant return.  
  
I can only say at the addressees, who display an incredible arrogance:  
"Don't be rediculous"  
"What do you think you are?"  
"Whom do you take me for?"  
"Downright Nonsense!"  
and so on...

Thank you for posting it!  
  
  
You see that Bollinger Lines at the weekly chart goes parallel now. May be then the EMA lines too. If so, then it could be a trading option to trade the weekly range but at M15/M30/H1 and wait at H4 for an breakout of the weekly chart.  
  
The monthly chart shows a hammer (august) but the upper shadow seems a little too long, so may be it's better to wait here what kind of candle is forming in September and trade in the meantime the Weekly, the Daily, (incl. H4, H1, M30, M15).  
  
The market has coming down at the weekly chart. Possiblities for a consolidation seems to be higher now. That means a range trading could be a favorite option, till the next breakout and the triangle could demonstrate this very clear.   
  
Great charts!  
Congrats!

NZDUSD, H4, 2010 September 10  
  
  
R1 broken at 0.7275 and mR2 is nearly achieved at 0.7306. H4 could forming a divergence.  
  
Enter Short at 0.729 with 3 positions.  
  
...and set:   
  
Pending Orders Enter Short at 0.732 / 0.735 / 0.753 (see weekly and monthly chart). Furthe upside movement could be possible.  
  
Even so 0.729 seems for me a good price for a first enter short.

If you intend to trade M1 you have to take a global look at M5, M15, M30 , may be H1 and trade only with the trend at these higher time frames in conjunction with price action, EMA Lines, pivotal points and/or murrey math.  
  
May be more expierenced traders could also trade counter the trend here and there.

Floating Loss - Open Trades - "Non Stop Loss Concept":  
  
In any system, you’ll encounter both winning and losing trades. So you’ll want to be able to **easily handle** any losing trades, and **continue** to trade the winning trades at the same time, so that you have a profitable system. That’s what forex money management is all about.  
  
You'll see that in the next weeks all open trades will running in the win, may be tomorrow, may be next week, may be next month, we don't know! It's only the drawback of my art of Non-Stop-Loss Trading, which you make allowance for the money management.

Risk and **money management** , or the art of **position sizing,** is an important part of your forex trading as you’ll soon find out..  
Why?  
Because it determines whether you’ll be able to keep trading as long as you like, to continue making your profits.  
  
In any system, you’ll encounter both winning and losing trades. So you’ll want to be able to **easily handle** any losing trades, and **continue** to trade the winning trades at the same time, so that you have a profitable system.  
That’s what forex money management is all about.

As an extreme example, if you put say a large chunk of your float into each trade without a position sizing model, and you make a profit, great, your profit will be much bigger than if you did have position sizing rules. So far so good. But if your next trade is a loss, you may lose your float, and that’s the end of the trading!  
  
Let’s take a more realistic example.  
Let’s say that your forex trading system has an 80% win-loss ratio, and that the size of your winning trades are on average 3 times that of your losing trades. This is your trading **edge**. This is why you can profit from your trading, whereas someone else who has no system, or is using an ineffective system, is unlikely to profit except out of pure luck.  
But even with this trading edge, you may hit a string of losses.  
So even with a good system, you still need to have an appropriate money management model to survive and prosper...

Let’s look into it a bit further.  
Let’s say that you’re trading a cash float of $5000, leveraged up to $500 000, that is with 100:1 leverage. And let’s say that the maximum drawdown of your system historically is $2000, when following a particular money management method. So in this case, the drawdown is 40% of the cash float. Maximum historical drawdown refers to the biggest decrease in the cash float that has occurred in the past when backtesting or trading your system.  
Now if you’re trading a good profitable system, then with the risk management rules that the system is designed to use, you can go on to make the profit that year that the system will generate. Say the system made 500% on your cash float that year. This means that by trading with that system, and its money management rules, you were then able to **overcome** this 40% loss, to end up 500%**in profit.**  
  
That is, you rode through the drawdown period, continued trading and made this tidy profit.

And another reason to have appropriate money management is that in the beginning, you may make mistakes in your trading. So your losses in the beginning days may be higher than necessary.  
That's why money management is important for any trading, including forex trading.

So let’s summarise these two crucial points so far:  
_1\. Money management is important, as it lets you live to tell the tale, and profit well!_  
_2\. The performance of a system, in terms of profits, drawdown, or any other parameter you want to measure, depends on both the system itself and the money management rules it uses. A system should suggest a range of acceptible money management method or rules which gives best results, that is, good profits and an acceptable drawdown._

http://www.theforextrader.net/forex-money-management.php  
  
Let’s have a look at a method of money management that’s often used, called the **percentage risk method.**  
Note that this is not the only method of risk management, and some systems do use a different risk method. But it is frequently used, and is good one for you to understand, so that you can then compare risk methods to each other.  
  
Money Management Part 1: Percentage Risk Method  
  
The percentage risk method as a money management method, **aims to “risk” the same percentage of your cash float (not the same trade size) per trade.** Note that you won’t have the same trade size for each trade necessarily.  
  
This method relies on knowing:  
1\. The stop loss size of the trade, and  
2\. The percentage risk (of your unleveraged cash float), that you want to risk per trade.  
  
So this percentage risk method says that there’ll be a certain percentage of your cash float that is at risk per trade. And to know how much is actually “at risk” in a specific trade, you need to know the above two parameters: the stop loss size for that trade, and the percentage risk that you’ve chosen.  
  
As an example, let’s say that you’ve chosen a percentage risk of 2% of your cash float. If your cash float is $5000, this means that you’d want to risk 2% of $5000 per trade, which is $100. So with every trade, the maximum you’d lose (assuming no gapping or slippage) would be $100.  
  
With this chosen percentage, it would take you 50 losses in a row before you’d lose all of your float (50 x 2% = 100%). Assuming that your system is a good one, then 50 losses in a row would be **very unlikely.**  
If your system for example has an 80% win loss ratio, and that the maximum number of losses in a row historically was 7, then getting 50 losses in a row is very unlikely. The chances of this happening in fact is 0.2 to the power of 50, a very small number.   
  
On the other hand, if the risk chosen was 4%, then it would take 25 rather than 50 losing trades in a row to lose the entire float. So as you can see, the number of losing trades required to lose the float decreases as you increase the percentage risk.  
  
So now that we know how much is at risk per trade, how do we calculate our actual **position size** for a particular trade?  
For currency pairs where the USD is the terms currency  
Let's firstly take the situation where we're trading a currency pair where the **USD is the terms currency** , such as EURUSD, GBPUSD, AUDUSD. To work out our trade size (face value), you would need to know the stop loss size of the trade. So:  
  
Assuming:  
**Cash float** is $ 5000 USD  
**% risk** is 2%  
**Risk per trade** is $100 USD (500 x 0.02), and  
We’re trading a currency pair where the USD is the terms currency  
Face value (of base currency) = risk per trade in $USD / stop loss size in $USD  
  
So for example, if we’re trading the EURUSD, and the stop loss size for that trade was 30 pips, then our stop loss size would be equivalent to 30 pips in USD, because if you make a profit or loss, it is in the terms currency.   
  
Therefore:   
Face value (of base currency) = $100 / $0.0030  
Face value (of base currency) = 33 333  
  
That is, 33 333 of the base currency, which in this example, is the EUR.  
For currency pairs where the USD is _not_ the terms currency  
What happens if your float is in say $USD, but the USD is **not** the terms currency? This occurs when you’re trading the USDCAD, USDCHF, USDJPY for example.   
  
In this case, you’d need to do **an extra step** , which is to adjust the stop loss size in the terms currency, to its value in $USD. That is:  
Stop loss size in $USD pips = Stop loss size in the terms currency (eg CAD, CHF, JPY) in pips / Price of the currency  
  
For example, if you’re trading USDCHF , and the stop loss size was 55 pips, and the currency rate for this pair was 1.2878, then:  
Stop loss size in $USD pips= 55 / 1.2878  
Stop loss size in $USD pips = 43 USD pips.  
  
You’d then use this number in the formula above to calculate your trade size or face value:  
  
Face value (of base currency) = risk per trade in $USD / stop loss size in $USD   
  
Face value (of base currency) = 100 / 0.0043  
  
Face value (of base currency) = 23 255 USD.  
  
Now, when looking at money management, also take into consideration your maximum number of open positions.

Position Sizing Part 2: Maximum Number Of Open Positions  
  
A final point to consider would be the maximum number of open positions, that is the maximum number of trades that you want to be in at one time.  
This is the other factor to decide when managing risk.  
  
If for example, you chose a 2% risk, you may also say chose to be in a maximum of 4 positions at any one time. If all 4 of those positions close out at a loss on the same day, then you would have had an 8% decrease in your cash float that day.  
This is a decision that you will have to make for yourself, though many systems will have a guide about this for you. In the beginning, your maximum number of open trades may depend on how well you know the system. You may find yourself starting with fewer trades on at the same time in the beginning, and considering a larger number as you get used to trading the system.  
  
Forex Money Management: Putting It All Together   
  
So putting it all together, all the way from how much float you have to how much profit is made from a trade...  
As an example, let’s say that you had a **cash float** of $10 000 and so your leveraged float is $1 000 000, and you used the fixed % risk model.  
  
For a trade where the **stop loss size** was 30 (terms currency) pips, and assuming a **fixed % risk** of say 3% (which is $300) of your cash float , your **trade size** in this trade would be 300/0.0030 = $100 000 worth of base currency.  
  
If your **profit** was then 75 **pips** , then this would be $750 **worth of the** **terms currency** (as the face value traded was $100 000).  
So there you have it.  
  
_An extra tip here for calculating the stop loss size:_  
Remember that when you’re looking at a chart, that you’re looking at the bid prices (most charts display bid, not offer, prices). Then as you set your stop loss, on many platforms, you have the choice of “stop if bid” or “stop if offered”. So say you were in a short trade, having entered at 1.2880, and your stop loss is at 1.2840. And according to your system rules, all stops are set as “stop is bid”.  
When you’re stopped out, you’d be buying when the **bid** price reaches 1.2740 because you’ve used “stop if bid”. But because you buy at the **offer** , your **actual** buy price would be at say 1.2843, due to the spread. Your stop loss is therefore actually 37 pips, not 40 pips. A small point, but one which often causes confusion.

Pip Value Calculator  
  
Use this **pip value calculator** if you want to know a **price of a single pip** for any Forex traded currency. Use this free Forex tool to calculate and plan your orders when dealing with many or exotic currency pairs. All you need to do is to fill the form below and press the "Calculate" button:  
  
<http://www.earnforex.com/pip-value-calculator>  
  
Although knowing the actual **value of a pip** in the U.S. dollars is trivial for such currency pairs as EUR/USD, GBP/USD, it is quite hard to tell the **pip value** for these currency pairs if your account is denominated in other currencies, or for any other pairs, which have a base currency other than your account is. These currency pairs also require the knowledge of the bid/ask price to convert the pip value to the account currency.  
You might also be interested in our [position size calculator](http://www.earnforex.com/position-size-calculator). It can help you to calculate the optimal size of the position depending on your stop-loss in pips, risk tolerance and account size.

Hi mrhb30jr  
  
  
Looks fine!  
  
Thank you!  
  
Could you explain me please, where the red and green arrows are making its signals? It's great, when it doesn't repaint! It's only an .ex4 file, so it's not possible for me to take a look at the mq4-code.  
  
Is it possible to code an extra at all question marks too, say at all CCI(14) 100/200 level tops and bottoms, which the trader could discrete switch on or off?  
  
Kindest regards  
FXcube

http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Dollar_Index  
  
USD Index  
  
Der U.S. Dollar Index (USDX) stellt das Verhältnis von sechs Währungen im Vergleich zum US-Dollar dar, wobei der [Euro](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro) mit dem Handelsvolumen aus zwölf [EU](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europ%C3%A4ische_Union)-Ländern berücksichtigt wird. Diese machen einen Anteil von 57,6 Prozent im Index aus. Die weiteren Währungen sind der [japanische Yen](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yen) (13,6 Prozent), das [britische Pfund](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pfund_Sterling) (11,9 Prozent), der [kanadische Dollar](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanadischer_Dollar) (9,1 Prozent), die [schwedische Krone](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwedische_Krone) (4,2 Prozent) sowie der [Schweizer Franken](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schweizer_Franken) (3,6 Prozent).  
Anhand des Verlaufs des U.S. Dollar Index lässt sich die Stärke oder Schwäche des US-Dollars ablesen. Ein steigender Index bedeutet eine Aufwertung des US-Dollars gegenüber den Währungen im [Währungskorb](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%C3%A4hrungskorb), ein fallender Index dagegen eine Abwertung.  
Zusammenhänge zum [CRB-Index](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRB-Index), der die Preisentwicklung von 19 Rohstoffen misst, sind erkennbar. Ein fallender U.S. Dollar Index bedeutet tendenziell steigende Rohstoffpreise. Dies gilt insbesondere für die Agrarrohstoffe und den [Ölpreis](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96lpreis). Selbst der [Goldpreis](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldpreis) korreliert mit einem fallenden Index. So markierte der U.S. Dollar Index am 17. März 2008 ein Allzeittief und der Goldpreis in US-Dollar am gleichen Tag ein Allzeithoch.  
Die Formel für die Berechnung des U.S. Dollar Index ist 50,14348112 multipliziert mit dem Produkt aller Bestandteile im Währungskorb, die zu einer Hochzahl angehoben werden, die ihrer prozentualen Gewichtung gleich ist ((EURUSD ^ - 0,576) * (JPY ^ - 0,136) * (GBP ^ - 0,119) * (CAN ^ - 0,091) * (SEK ^ - 0,042) * (CHF^ - 0,036)). Alle Währungen werden in den Maßeinheiten der Währung pro US-Dollar ausgedrückt.[[1]](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Dollar_Index#cite_note-ICE-0)  
Vergleichbar mit dem U.S. Dollar Index ist der „Broad Index“ der [US-Notenbank](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System) (FED). Der Index der FED misst im Vergleich zum U.S. Dollar Index viel akkurater den Wert des US-Dollars, da die Gewichtung der FED die Wettbewerbsfähigkeit US-amerikanischer Güter im Vergleich zu anderen Ländern und Handelspartnern stellt.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Dollar_Index  
  
The **US Dollar Index** (USDX) is an [index](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_number) (or measure) of the value of the [United States dollar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar) relative to a [basket](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_basket) of foreign currencies.  
It is a [weighted geometric mean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_geometric_mean) of the dollar's value compared only with

  1. [Euro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro) (EUR), 57.6% weight
  2. [Japanese yen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen) (JPY), 13.6% weight
  3. [Pound sterling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling) (GBP), 11.9% weight
  4. [Canadian dollar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_dollar) (CAD), 9.1% weight
  5. [Swedish krona](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_krona) (SEK), 4.2% weight and
  6. [Swiss franc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_franc) (CHF) 3.6% weight.

USDX started in March 1973, soon after the dismantling of the [Bretton Woods system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system). At its start, the value of the US Dollar Index was 100.000. It has since traded as high as the mid-160s and as low as 70.698 on March 16, 2008, the lowest since its inception in 1973.  
The makeup of the "basket" has been altered only once, when several European currencies were subsumed by the Euro at the start of 1999.  
USDX is updated whenever US Dollar markets are open, which is from Sunday evening New York time (early Monday morning Asia time) for 24 hours a day to late Friday afternoon New York time.  
USDX can be traded as a [futures contract](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract) on the [IntercontinentalExchange](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IntercontinentalExchange) (ICE). It is also available in [exchange traded funds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_traded_funds) (ETFs), options and [mutual funds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_funds).

****What is the U.S. Dollar Index?****  
  
If you’ve traded [stocks](http://www.babypips.com/school/forex_versus_stocks.html), you’re familiar with all the indices available such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), NASDAQ Composite Index, Russell 2000, S&P 500, Wilshire 5000, and the Nimbus 2001. Oh wait, the last one is actually Harry Potter’s broomstick.   
Well if U.S. stocks have an index, the U.S. dollar can’t be outdone. For currency traders like us, we have the U.S. Dollar Index (USDX).  
The U.S. Dollar Index consists of a geometric weighted average of a basket of foreign currencies against the dollar.   
Come again?! Okay before you fall asleep on us after that super geeky definition, let’s break it down.   
It’s very similar to how the stock indices work in that it provides a general indication of the value of a basket of securities. Of course, the “securities” we’re talking about here are other major world currencies.   
  
**The Basket**  
  
The U.S. Dollar Index consists of six foreign currencies. They are the:

  1. Euro (EUR)
  2. Yen (JPY)
  3. Cable (GBP)
  4. Loonie (CAD)
  5. Kronas (SEK)
  6. Francs (CHF)

Here’s a trick question. If the index is made up of 6 currencies, how many _countries_ are included?   
If you answered “6”, you’re wrong. If you answered “21”, you’re a genius.   
There are 21 countries total, because there are 16 members of the European Union that have adopted the euro as their sole currency, plus the other five countries (Japan, Great Britain, Canada, Sweden, and Switzerland) and their accompanying currencies.   
It’s obvious that 21 countries make up a small portion of the world but many other currencies follow the U.S. Dollar index very closely. This makes the USDX a pretty good tool for measuring the U.S. dollar’s global strength.

**The USDX Components**  
  
Now that we know what the basket of currencies are, let’s get back to that “geometric weighted average” part. Because not every country is the same size, it’s only fair that each is given appropriate weights when calculating the [U.S. Dollar Index](http://www.babypips.com/school/what_is_the_us_dollar_index.html). Check out the current weights:  
  
[http://www.babypips.com/school/image...ex-weights.gif](http://www.babypips.com/school/images/us-dollar-index-weights.gif)   
  
As you can see, with its 12 countries, euros make up a big chunk of the U.S. Dollar Index. The other five make up less than 43 percent.   
  
Here's something interesting: When the euro falls, which way does the U.S Dollar Index move?  
The euro makes up such a huge portion of the U.S. Dollar Index, they might as well call this index the "Anti-Euro Index". Because the USDX is so heavily influenced by the euro, people have looked for a more "balanced" dollar index. More on that later though. First, let's go to the charts!

**How to Read the U.S. Dollar Index**  
  
Here’s a chart of the U.S. Dollar at the Dollar Index:  
  
[](http://www.babypips.com/school/images/usdx.gif)<http://www.babypips.com/school/images/usdx.gif>   
  
First, notice that the index is calculated 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The [USDX](http://www.babypips.com/school/what_is_the_us_dollar_index.html) measures the dollar’s general value relative to a base of 100.000. Huh?!  
Okay. For example, the current reading says 86.212. This means that the dollar has fallen 13.788% since the start of the index. (86.212 - 100.000).   
If the reading was 120.650, it means the dollar’s value has risen 20.650% since the start of the index. (120.650 – 100.00)  
  
The start of the index is March 1973. This is when the world’s biggest nations met in Washington D.C. and all agreed to allow their currencies to float freely against each. The start of the index is also known as the “base period”.   
**The U.S. Dollar Index Formula**  
  
This is strictly for the grown and geeky. Here is the formula to calculating USDX:  

USDX = 50.14348112 × EURUSD^(-0.576) × USDJPY^(0.136) × GBPUSD^(-0.119) × USDCAD^(0.091) × USDSEK^(0.042) × USDCHF^(0.036)

A carry trade involves borrowing or selling a financial instrument with a low interest rate, then using it to purchase a financial instrument with a higher interest rate. While you are paying the low interest rate on the financial instrument you borrowed/sold, you are collecting higher interest on the financial instrument you purchased. Thus your profit is the money you collect from the interest rate differential.

**Currency Carry Trade**  
  
  
  
[http://i.investopedia.com/inv/092009.../book_icon.jpg](http://i.investopedia.com/inv/092009/dictionary/book_icon.jpg)  
**What Does _Currency Carry Trade_ Mean?**  
A strategy in which an investor sells a certain currency with a relatively low [interest rate](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currencycarrytrade.asp#) and uses the funds to purchase a different currency yielding a higher interest rate. A trader using this strategy attempts to capture the difference between the rates, which can often be substantial, depending on the amount of leverage used.  
  
[http://i.investopedia.com/inv/092009...y/inv_icon.jpg](http://i.investopedia.com/inv/092009/dictionary/inv_icon.jpg)  
**  
Investopedia explains _Currency Carry Trade_**  
Here's an example of a "yen carry trade": a trader borrows 1,000 Japanese yen from a Japanese [bank](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currencycarrytrade.asp#), converts the funds into U.S. dollars and buys a bond for the equivalent amount. Let's assume that the bond pays 4.5% and the Japanese interest rate is set at 0%. The trader stands to make a profit of 4.5% as long as the exchange rate between the countries does not change. Many professional traders use this trade because the gains can become very large when leverage is taken into consideration. If the trader in our example uses a common leverage factor of 10:1, then she can stand to make a profit of 45%.   
  
The big risk in a carry trade is the uncertainty of exchange rates. Using the example above, if the U.S. dollar were to fall in value relative to the Japanese yen, then the trader would run the risk of losing money. Also, these transactions are generally done with a lot of leverage, so a small movement in exchange rates can result in huge losses unless the position is hedged appropriately.

see #[**606**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4016893&postcount=606)   
  
So am I,... with regard at M5 candle if it would touch the middle line of BB (1. Warning for an M5 Exit) but at least with setting a Stop Loss a little bit further downside at the bottom line of BB or at the low of the hammer.

CADJPY, Monthly, 2010 September 13  
  
Vintage chart here with the Fibonacci lines.  
  
Monthly chart has make a touch down exactly at 61.8% last month.  
  
September has reached just now the 50% line. May be it's good time for a range trading at lower time levels (H4, H1, M30, M15) now.  
  
Could be great for Range Box Trading: M15 see#[**616**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4018422&postcount=616), H1, see #[**617**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4018458&postcount=617), H4, see #[**617.**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4018458&postcount=617)

EURUSD, H4 and H1 CCI(14).  
  
H1 CCI(14)'s double Top shows a divergence which is followed by a Tweezers Top and Three Crows, see #[**622**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4019133&postcount=622) , please.  
  
H4 seems to show a Top too. If H4 would give final shape to one more Top, so enter short then again with several positions (2/3).   
  
Enter Short at 1.2860 with 2 positions.  
  
Target: 1.2765 (S1 1.2759) / 1.2710 (mR2 1.2698)

USDCHF 1.000 / 1.004 seems for me an excellent entry chance for a long term trading enter, even so 0.98  
  
I tend to overweight this position in my currency portfolio, even if it would cause a greater drawdown, so I would take of a greater risk for this currency, say till 5%. I could hedge these positions if it would fall down extremely deeper, may be this week till friday.  
  
Lowest price: 2008.03.01 Low 0.9638

Fibonacci method in Forex  
  
Straight to the point:  
Fibonacci Retracement Levels are:  
0.382, 0.500, 0.618 — three the most important levels  
Fibonacci retracement levels are used as support and resistance levels  
  
Fibonacci Extension Levels are:  
0.618, 1.000, 1.618 — three the most important levels  
Fibonacci extension levels are used as profit taking levels.  
  
So, what we will learn today is how to apply Fibonacci tool and how to interpret results that we see on the screen.  
  
To set up Fibonacci on the chart we need to find out:  
1\. Is it uptrend or downtrend?   
2\. Highest and lowest swings in the chart formation (A, B points).  
And go with the trend!  
  
So, click on Fibonacci tool from trading platform that you use. Now, as shown on the Figure 1:  

<http://www.forexfibonacci.com/fibonacci1.gif>

  
  
We have an uptrend. A — our lowest swing, B — our highest swing. So, we will look to BUY some lots at the good lowest price and go up with the trend.  
  
Click on A and drag your cursor to B, click. There you go! You must see different lines appeared on your chart. Those lines are called Fibonacci Retracement and Extension Levels.  
  
So, what we are expecting is next: the price should retrace (go down) from point B to some point C, and then continue up in the direction of the trend.   
  
Those three dotted lines (0.618, 0.500, 0.382) at the bottom on our picture shows three Fibonacci retracement levels where we expect the price to take a U-turn and go up again. There we will place our BUY order.   
  
The best situation would be to buy at the lowest level — 0.618 — point C. And on practice the price usually gives us this chance. However, 0.500 is also a good level to place a BUY order.

Well, let's take a look at the progress.  
  

<http://www.forexfibonacci.com/fibonacci2.gif>

  
  
The price has successfully reached the lowest 0.618 point and made a U-turn.  
So, now when we have our BUY order placed at desired point C, we would like to set some targets to take our profit in the future. For profit taking levels we use Fibonacci extension levels (0.618, 1.000, 1.618). The most common is 0.618 extension level, but when the price shows good potential to reach next 1.000 or even 1.618 level, you can leave your trade to get that target too.  
  
We will choose 0.618 extension level as our profit target, and according to Figure 2, D is our point for taking profit.  
  
**Important note:** in this Fibonacci tutorial 0.618 extension level (as well as 1.000, 1.618 levels) are calculated in relation to the point B, which means that B point represents a 0% extension.  
  
Some Forex traders like to start counting from point A, then the distance from A to B would be already 100% of the price move. Thus moving further from B would be 1xx.x %.  
  
For example: looking at the last picture, if to start counting from point A, then point D would be a 1.618 Fibonacci extension level or a 161.8% of the price move.

Now let's have a look at a real forex chart.

Same steps will also apply to downtrend price movement.

A little bit of theory:  
Leonardo Fibonacci is a founder of a simple series of numbers related to the natural proportions of things in the universe. Fibonacci numbers create ratios that arise from the following number series: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144: Calculated this way: 0+1=1, 1+1=2, 1+2=3 and so forth.  
  
The ratio of any number in relevance to the next higher number is 0.618. E.g. 55/89=0.618.  
There is no need to perform calculation each time you get into a trade, your trading platform is going to do it for you.

Traders use the Fibonacci retracement levels as support and resistance levels. Since so many traders watch these same levels and place buy and sell orders on them to enter trades or place stops, the support and resistance levels become a self-fulfilling expectation.

Getting straight to the meat, Fibonacci Retracements are probability points where a currency, or stock will "bounce back" to, after a large move, and then continue in the original direction. Think of Retracements in terms of Newton's Laws of Motion: "For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction."   
  
Within this understanding, trading carries some of the same principals. However, I would like to add that after a large move, the opposite reaction loses energy quickly, and thus, is often why the 'reactive move' after a large move, is often less than the large move itself.  
Ironically, Leonardo Fibonacci lived in the 13th century, while Newton worked in the 17th century. Perhaps Fibonacci unknowingly uncovered truth behind Newton's laws, centuries before Newton even came up with them.  
  
**Fibonacci in Nature**  
If you're not familiar with Fibonacci ratios and numbers the concepts are directly derived from nature and are found in virtually all organic sciences today. Basically, Fibonacci numbers are resultant from adding the previous together to find the next. For example 1+1=2, 2+1=3, 3+2=5, 5+3=8 and so on. The Fibonacci string would look like: 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233...  
In nature, the spiral of seeds in a sunflower are exactly ordered in Fibonacci sequence, as with many occurrences in organic life.  
  
Fibonacci ratios are also derived from the numerical sequence For example, if you take any eighth number in the sequence and divide it by the number following it in the sequence (dividing the eight by the ninth), the answer will ALWAYS be 61.8. In the above string, if we divide the eighth number (21) by the ninth (34), we get 61.76, or 61.8 rounded up.  
It just is, that's why.  
Market quants hold that Fibonacci is not only true in organic matter, but within the market itself, and Fibonacci ratios, more often than not, lay out of a map for retracement levels, after a significant move. Thus, perhaps Newton's Law of Motion that says, "For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction" failed to take into account the loss of energy in reaction, something that may be solved with Fibonacci ratios. I believe there would be another factor involved though, which may be overcome combining the founder of quantum physics Max Karl Ernst Ludwig Planck's formula, where "energy is and absorbed in quantities divisible by discrete 'energy elements'"* and simple Fibonacci.  
  
Perhaps someday I will make an attempt to prove my instincts in math. Before I get sidetracked (which is way too easy) any further though, let's look into how you can - very simply - use Fibonacci Retracements in Forex trading...  
  
**Fibonacci in Forex - The Self Fulfilling Prophecy**  
All of the magical math in the world will never make Fibonacci retracements true 100% of the time. Period. Thus, a little common sense goes a long way when using any type of mathematical, or technical indicator to trade from. If the market is showing something different than the indicator, enough people believe in something different that the indicator is wrong. Fibonacci retracements are only good so long as enough people are watching and acting on the same information that the collective whole makes the occurrence a self-fulfilling prophecy. What I'm saying is that even if you've opened a trade based on Fibonacci retracement expectations, be prepared to close the position, should common sense warrant such.  
  
With the aforementioned in mind, Fibonacci Retracements work on both short and long-term time frames for all types of traders. For this article, we will only look at short-term trading with 4-hour charts.  
  
First, before we even consider a Fibonacci retracements, you need to be able to spot when a move has occurred that would warrant using Fibonacci Retracements. This can be as simple as looking at a chart, and visually seeing that a large move has transpired - and capitulated. What I mean by this is, if when looking at a chart you're expecting to see empirical proof that a move has stalled, you will never be able to do so. You will see some signs, like MACD or Stochastics bottoming out, or a candlestick pattern like a hammer bottom, but you will never know for sure. One way to have a slight bit of assurance though, is to look for candlestick confirmation, something I recently covered in my article Why Confirmation Counts.  
  
Regardless, only countless hours of pouring over charts will give you 'the feel'. Once you are able to infer a move is over, you can begin to apply Fibonacci retracements for profit targets points if you are trying to trade the rebound, or for new entries, if you are waiting to get back into the currency, for a continued move in the same direction, as the previous 'large move.'  
The below chart shows a significant move that recently occurred when the U.S. dollar sold off against the Swiss franc. Based on this chart, many traders were likely looking for a retracement. Some turned the dollar long, others waited for key retracement levels to be hit before taking positions...  
  
[http://images.tradingmarkets.com/200...-025108-01.gif](http://images.tradingmarkets.com/2008/HowTo/MW-025108-01.gif)  
  
  
Now, let me show you how you can trade a 'reversal' using Fibonacci, after a large move.  
  
In the below chart, you will see a large downward move, where the Australian dollar declined significantly against the New Zealand dollar. Several indicator (not shown) displayed that a reversal was looming, thus perceptive traders would have taken a long position in the Australian dollar, using the low of the range as a stop. The AUD quickly rebounded, touching the 38.2 retracement within 12 hours of the low. However, it sold off again (twice actually) before making another run at the 50% retracement. Jittery traders would have been shaken out for sure; however, those with steadfast stops just below the low of the original moves would have not. (You must decide for you whether you will trade for larger moves, or quickly scalp profits any time the market makes a sudden moves. It is my experience that traders who take small profit after small profit and cannot hold for larger wins, eventually get killed when they take a bigger loss. Truly great traders know one of the keys to success is: little loss, little loss, big win, not vice versa.)  
  
[http://images.tradingmarkets.com/200...-025108-02.gif](http://images.tradingmarkets.com/2008/HowTo/MW-025108-02.gif)  
  
Regardless, those who were able to hold, would have seen the AUD/NZD briefly pop above the 50% retracement a few days after the initial move occurred. Here's one way to solve the problem previously shown by failure at the 38.2% retracement. When trading a reversal, set your stop as soon as you make the trade. Then, set a sell order for one quarter of your position at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement, so if the trade fails, you will have a small buffer when your stop is hit on the downside. (You will need to adjust the position size in your stop, if the 38.2% retracement is hit, accounting for the 25% of your position you just sold for a profit.) At the same time you made the initial trade, set a sell order for 50% of the total initial position at the 50% retracement. In the case of AUD/NZD, when the pair first hit the 50% retracement, you would have taken even more off the table and would need to adjust your stop order accordingly, as you will now only have 25% of the original position. Then, with the remaining 25%, you can set another order to sell at the 61.8% retracement, or let it ride. FYI, from my experience trading Forex, the 50% retracement mark seems to hold the most weight. If a pair does not reverse the bounce after the large move, and you see a 4-hour bar close above the 50% retracement, there's a good chance the pair will retrace the whole move. I'm not sure why, but from what I've seen the 61.8% retracement seems to hold less weight than the 50% retracement, at least when using 4-hour charts.  
  
Regardless, the retracements serve as profit targets for reversal trades.  
For traders who think the pair will continue the original move, you can place your orders at the Fibonacci retracement points, where you hope to reenter in the direction of the big-move trend. One way to do so is place an order for 25% of your total predetermined size at the 38.2% mark, 50% at the 50% mark and 25% at the 61.8% mark. This way, you've allowed yourself 'wiggle room' if the 38.2% and 50% retracements do not hold. It's important to note though, that if the 61.8% retracement is breached, the pair will likely retrace the entire move, something that happens often in Forex trading. The best rule of thumb in this case is as simple as the old market saying: When in doubt, get out.

In [this](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3928615&postcount=18) post you are talking about your balance on July 26th. Yet your current myfxbook system starts on august 27th. What happened to the previous system?  
I also noticed that your current open losses are about 40% bigger, than all the gains for the life of the account. Do you really think that having a 100% hit rate is important enough to hold bad trades until they margin call your account. Your avg win is 40 pips yet most of your open trades are about 500 pips in the red. Since you hold all your losers until they turn into winners, why do you need all of those 20 or so indicators and lines on your charts. Looks like you could do it with just flipping a coin, place your trade, then wait until it becomes a winner. Its not like all of those indicators are increasing your accuracy.  
Not trying to be an a$$ or anything, just genuinely curious.

Brilliant! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
...with one exception:  
I wouldn't trade the daily EURUSD at the moment, due to the fact of modest risk-reward ratio. May be at 1.33 down if H4 CCI(14) could be at his top. USDCHF seems for me a good deal better.  
  
Sincerely  
FC

Floating Loss - Open Trades - "Non Stop Loss Concept":  
  
In any system, you’ll encounter both winning and losing trades. So you’ll want to be able to **easily handle** any losing trades, and **continue** to trade the winning trades at the same time, so that you have a profitable system. That’s what forex money management is all about.  
  
You'll see that in the next weeks all open trades will running in the win, may be tomorrow, may be next week, may be next month, we don't know! It's only the drawback of my art of Non-Stop-Loss Trading, which you make allowance for the money management.

The open trades (Floating Loss) are like ice flows, as time drew on the losses will become smaller and smaller.

The performance of a system, in terms of profits, drawdown, or any other parameter you want to measure, depends on both the system itself and the money management rules it uses. A system should suggest a range of acceptible money management method or rules which gives best results, that is, good profits and an acceptable drawdown.

AUDUSD, Daily, 2010 September 15  
  
  
Daily market price has reached the murrey math "Overshoot Level" [+1/8] with a negative divergence. CCI(14) is at its Top and the EMA Lines could running out of steam.  
  
Taken en masse, ...seems for me a good occasion to enter short with several positions.  
  
Enter Short at 0.9350 with 3 positions.  
  
A confirmation could come up if the price will go definitely under 0.9361 (H4 EMA10 Line).

"Non Stop Loss Concept"  
  
In any system, you’ll encounter both winning and losing trades. So you’ll want to be able to **easily handle** any losing trades ("ice flows"), and **continue** to trade the winning trades at the same time, so that you have a profitable system. That’s what forex money management is all about.  
see #[**651**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4023392&postcount=651)   
  
  
You'll see that in the next weeks all open trades ("ice flows") will running in the win ("water pot"), may be tomorrow, may be next week, may be next month, we don't know! It's only the drawback of my art of Non-Stop-Loss Trading, which you make allowance for the money management.   
  
Non Stop Loss Concept   
13 "non-stop-loss-trades" have running into the win at 2010 September 15. A part of them could have been a deficit by trading the stopp loss concept. I know why many brokers favour the stopp loss concept. Why? You have only reduce your lot size a wee bit. All yellow marked trades are 9 days to 16 days old.  
  
Yellow trades:  
TOTAL: + 4'339.18 $![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
_Ne'er the broker's money! These "ice flows" will making the profit pot bigger. It will bound to happen sooner or later._

Oh yes! RSI, CCI and MACD signalize a neg. divergence. I would go enter short with 1 position and would wait for a CCI(14) 200 Line Top and enter short then again with 3 positions. Could also be that the market consolidate before his next upside movement. MACD couuld go a little further up, also CCI. Might be better to wait for an excellent H4/daily price formation like a shooting star at the top or so.  
Remember the date 2008.12.28 with its High at 1.7991. H1 seems to go upwards in the direction of CCI(14) 100 line, may be more.

I would prefere to trade the fib range 61.8 - 38.2 (at H4, Daily) and wait for a breakout each time at lower timeframes (may be M15/M30).

Hi FC,  
  
AUDLfx on D1 candle patterns up side gap two crown  
and negative div ....  
  
**Important Factors:**  
The two black candlesticks of the pattern are the crows reminding ominous looking black crows atop a tree branch.  
Confirmation for the Bearish Upside Gap Two Crows Pattern may be mildly suggested. If in the fourth session prices fail to regain high ground, lower prices should be expected.  
  
on Weekly TF possible bearish evening star

Hi buddy!  
  
I have set a pending order Short at 1.635 with 3 positions.  
  
Target: 1.47  
  
Hope that prices will come up to this level and may be will see a shooting star or engulfing pattern or other candle patterns that will signalizing higher possibilities of a downward movement then. May be go short with one position at 1.62 but I think it seems it could be a little bit to early. So I have decided to wait in discipline.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f612.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/231b.png?v=15.1) ,...and be aware of a breakout further north.

Hi FC.....  
  
AUDUSD on D1 TF .. Candle Pattern state possible The Bearish Three Inside Down Pattern and check to WK TF possible shooting star.....  
  
D1 TF CCI 14 is on the negative div......  
  
tomorrow I hope we will see Bearish engulfing pattern to confirm the reversal of AUD .. key point area 0.923xx for middle term reversal and 0.91xx   
  
and long term down trend is below 0.87xxx  
  
The Bearish Three Inside Down Pattern is another name for the Confirmed Bearish Harami Pattern. The third day confirms the bearish trend reversal.  
**Recognition Criteria:**  
1\. Market is characterized by uptrend.  
2\. We see a Bearish Harami Pattern in the first two days.  
3\. We then see a black candlestick on the third day with a lower close than the second day.  
**Explanation:**   
The first two days of this three-day pattern is a Bearish Harami Pattern, and the third day confirms the reversal suggested by Bearish Harami Pattern since it is a black candlestick closing with a new low for the three days.  
**Important Factors:**  
The reliability of this pattern is very high, but still a confirmation in the form of a black candlestick with a lower close or a gap-down is suggested.   
  
enclosure the chart D1 ....

Weekly and monthly chart shows an upward trend and monthly is now struggling at his resistance level around 0.9385 like 2009.11.01 and 2010.04.01. If the price vola are related powerful like 2010.07.01 and 2010.05.01 we could see prices over 0.962. In addition the Bearish Harami Pattern isn't a real classical one.  
  
**Bearish Harami**  
  
If the first candle of Harami is a**long** bullish candle then the pattern has bearish implications. Especially if the pattern appears on top of an uptrend then it could be a sign of reversal (see image).  

[http://www.forexbrace.com/images/sto...ish_Harami.png](http://www.forexbrace.com/images/stories/candlestick_image_source/40_Bearish_Harami.png)

If the second candle is a doji or a bearish spinning top then the reversal sign could be more reliable but there are times that even a bullish spinning top could be a good sign of reversal. Since this pattern is not a reliable one at all times, the best practice is to use other tools to confirm it.   
  
May be in conjunction with BB we have a powerful argument more, so Bollinger Band might to be a good tool for this purpose. In this special market environment now, someone could tend to prefere to use the Enhanced Bands Indicator which could be even better as combines both BB and volatility to predict the tops (and the bottom) of the market.  
  
Moreover: My daily chart shows only one inside pattern and not three of them. It could also be only some spinning tops which make an appearance at the weekly and monthly resistance level.  
  
So I stay at the sideline due to the fact that the weekly and monthly chart are in a powerful upward trend and due to the fact that friday is a day where a trader shoudn't regularily trade. So we'll see next week, may be end of month more. My mind is: Be careful! I would trade M30/H1/H4 but not the turnaround at the daily chart now!, although good powerful arguments are here for a trading daily down.  
  
Kindest regards

I like your interpetation very much and I think this is that big capital will mislead most of the 95% traders now. It could be that the market price will go down. We don't know. But I think now many traders take a short and tomorrow friday big capital could turn market price up in the heaven. Earliest opportunity! Why not? This could going to happen willy-nilly. If so then we could see a scenario like this: most of the traders will exit there loss trade if not a stop loss have they turn out of the market before and then when market price should pushes enough high, the big turn down will coming soon! So I go with one's gut. But we have no securities. Could be that market price will turn down and never come up again this month. I don't know. For me probabilities seems not so ideal, so for me I stay at the sideline and wait. Time will come and I earn my money - sure enough,...but not at a friday!![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Sincerely,

**An Introduction to Harami**  
  
The word Harami in Japanese means pregnant. A Harami candle formation is a two candlestick pattern. In an ideal form the first candle has a long real body and the second candle is a spinning top. The real body of the second candle is located within the body of the first candle. In other words open and close of the second candle are within the open and close of the first candle. The Harami pattern is similar to the "inside day" Western pattern. If the second candle is a doji then Harami is called _Harami Cross_ or _Petrifying Pattern_ (see image).  
  

[http://www.forexbrace.com/images/sto.../42_Harami.png](http://www.forexbrace.com/images/stories/candlestick_image_source/42_Harami.png)

  
  

The second candle (i.e. the smaller one) could be a doji, a bearish candle, or a bullish candle both in bearish and bullish situations.

**  
Bullish Harami**  
If the first candle of Harami is a long bearish candle then the pattern has bullish implications. Especially if the pattern appears at the bottom of a downtrend then it could be a sign of reversal (see image).  
  

[http://www.forexbrace.com/images/sto...ish_Harami.png](http://www.forexbrace.com/images/stories/candlestick_image_source/39_Bullish_Harami.png)

  
If the second candle is a doji or a bullish spinning top then the reversal sign could be more reliable but there are times that even a bearish spinning top could be a good sign of reversal. Since this pattern is not a reliable one at all times, the best practice is to use other tools to confirm it. I have personally found Bollinger Bands (BB) to be a good tool for this purpose. You may also use the Enhanced Bands indicator which could be even better as combines both BB and volatility to predict the bottoms and tops of the market.

Harami patterns could appear both as continuation and reversal signs.

Thank you FXCube. I also had the opportunity to get some feedback from MrHb30Jr about it. My confusion was created because of my broker which is forex.com does not provide me those indexes in their MT4. So, I didn't know how interpret them. Anyway, Thank you both of guys.

Hi CostaRica  
  
Oil prices seems for me assessable. Gold seems for me absolutely an unratable commodity. I have some shorts but I'm not content with it however much it will run in the win one day.   
  
Silver is at its top at 20.90 an I think that we'll see the 9/10 again in the next months. In longer term (some years) big investment could hype silver up till 100$ or 200$ or even much more. It's out of our hands now!  
  
Kindest regards  
FXcube

Hi PhAnTi'  
  
Look at the Market Tips and the history file #[**694**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4029897&postcount=694), please or here, #[**48**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3929225&postcount=48) please. There are all these currencies which I have trade in the last weeks, in demo as well as at the real accounts.  
(Or at the history files in the attachment at this forum).  
  
I prefere the H4 timeframes with an eye toward Daily at present, the daily with regard at Weekly and Monthly and when I scalping often alongside the M5 with a view to M15/M30/H1.   
  
Hope it helps!  
  
Bon week-end!

Hello PhAnTi'   
  
Oh yes it could be really interesting!  
  
I have only a little knowledge about mq4 code just now, may be I will take more time and learn more about it next year. Isn't complicated, may be complex.  
  
Hope that someone is interesting to write an EA and post it here.  
  
May be with CCI(14) tops and bottoms, say the 100/200 line and the upper and lower Bollinger Band at H4 for the first.  
  
Is someone here who is interesting in writing an EA?  
  
Bon week-end!  
FXcube

Notice:  
Trading the CCI(14) Tops and Bottoms with a comfortable advanced trading style?  
Why wait till the lower Top CCI T2 and not go out at its highest T1?  
T1 shows a CCI(14) Top and you could go easy out at this point: 109.97 (Pivot D S2) or 110.15 (murrey math mml7 "Sell Premium Zone"). Why not? If so you have earn your money, simple too,..., may be not the most of possible money! Why? The EMA 10/20 lines was in a strong uptrend (high volatility) and so let the win run and take more risk over and wait a little more, may be with setting a stop loss e.g. at mS2 110.52 after T1 you could have run the win further on. There was a price action down (see the two red candles between DS1 and DPV) but they hadn't triggered the stop loss. The next CCI Top T2 shows then definitely a significant divergence at H4 chart and so it would be better to take out the profit here by not later then.

If you start sweating when you watch the price swings of a product you have invested in, you either have the wrong trading concept, are in the wrong products, or your positions are too big.

The biggest losses happen after investors make their first big profits. If you accumulate profits with a proven, tested investment strategy, you can pride yourself on its success.  
However, if you make profits without an investment strategy, you may lose not only all your profits but your total investment. Unexpected price moves do not have to mean big losses; they occur because investors work with the wrong trading concept.

Hello mrb30jr  
  
EURCHF, H4, 2010 September 19  
  
I would trade longer term H4 the CCI(14) Tops and Bottoms, may be short term the M15 CCI(14) tops and bottoms with confirming of EMA10/20 crossover. Monthly and Weekly shows a positive divergence. Could be that you'll see the 1.3070 at the next CCI(14) bottom. If volatility should be high may be it could better to wait for a further argument (price action, lower time frames, murrey math, or so).  
  
Hope it helps!  
  
Kindest regards

I would calculate avg. pip profit from last ~ 500 trades and use this as t/p,  
then further you can adapt it by spectating trades and their moves after t/p has been reached...  
  
refering to your margin call.... how about using s/l?

Good Luck!  
  
I stay a little at the sideline and wait. Market seems to be all in all indifferent.  
  
Happy Trading!

XAGUSD, Daily, 2010 September 21  
  
Enter Short at 20.70 with 5 positions.  
  
Daily CCI(14) shows a divergence. CCI(14) is at its Top. Inside bar (and ADX over 60). Time to get down!  
  
H4 candles now under EMA10, see #[**714**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4037445&postcount=714) and market price is at monthly chart in the "overshoot level" [+1/8] murrey math, see #[**715**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4037492&postcount=715).   
  
Let two positions run till 9/11 and earn the carry trades in a long run alongside.

XAGUSD, Monthly, 2010 September 21  
  
Monthly Chart shows the market price in an murreey math "Overshoot Level" [+1/8]  
  
May be that the market speculators will push silver in the "Extreme Overshoot Level" murrey math [+2/8]. If so then I will take an enter short again with 3 positions.

You could have made money with Time Cell Trading the Tops & the Bottoms with XAGUSD H1 also in an upward movement if you have been sold silver at all CCI(14) Tops and have bougt it at all the bottoms. May be you could have earned more money if you have taken a look at the parallel running EMA10/20 lines,... so let your win run and don't go out at every CCI (14) Top. H1 middle line of Bollinger Band should it have pointed out even so.

p.1, #[**4**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3928227&postcount=4)   
Candles are running down at the lower line of Bollinger Band, say volatility seems to be extremely high. Ergo: Let your win run. RSI was under 0 too and descending. If candles would touches the middle line of BB may be it's time to go out with your trade. I would prefere the pivot points.   
113.67 - 112.65 seems for me enough when trading with a M15 chat. So it's time to take out your wins with the help of pivot points or murrey math or when you think okay my wins are for me enough.

Hi CostaRica  
  
_Window/Mac_  
I have 3 Windows PC and 4 Mac PC high speed (and 3 Laptops). One PC is only for writing E-Mails and go at Forexfactory, not for trading the big money. 5 PC are exclusively for forex trading and are solely for managing the 14 actual real accounts at 5 different brokers.   
  
_Broker_  
I change the broker from time to time because I am not really content with all of them. I don't know if it could be dangerous to say which broker I have due to the fact that it could be an easy thing for hackers to find out the additive informations and then they could make me a dangerous problem. May be it's better not to post the brokers here on board. I prefere brokers with a tight spread and a fair play.  
  
Hope it helps!![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
Kindest regards  
Fxcube

30 sec. or/and M1 OR M2 with CCI(14) and EMA5/8 instead of EMA10/20.   
Trading with M1 is only for catching a few pips, say 2-7 pis. And take a look at the Bollinger Bands.  
30 sec/M1 could be intereting sometimes e.g. at EURUSD with a tight spread not more then 1.5

Hi Pip26  
  
Short Usd/Jpy, Aud/Usd, Aud/Jpy, Gbp/Jpy, it's okay! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
(Be aware that you triple the risk if you trade with three 3 JPY currency pairs at the same time in the same direction).  
  
  
but Usd/Cad Short, really? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f615.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/2753.png?v=15.1)I think you mean long?

Waiting for Eur/Usd, Gbp/Chf, Usd/Chf![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
I would go in EURUSD Short and GBPCHF Long and USDCHF Long just now.  
  
All CCIs(14) seems for me okay for making a market entry.

I am short EURUSD and EURJPY as CCI & RSI started pointing down, Long USDCHF CCI is pointing up. For GBPCHF waiting for candle close or RSI to point upside.. but if i follow simple rules of CCI(14) then i shld take it as CCI is pointing up now.

Hi PhAnTi'  
  
First: Learn the basics, please. How is CCi(14) calculated at September 21/22 ?. Then look at all these indifferent candles before. Could it be a favored option for a market entry,... after 16 indifferent candles upwrds, when Ema Lines are crossing downwards? How is at this point CCI(14) calculated? So the price action shows many indifferent candles and is moving the middle line of bollinger downwards. Not the best probabilities for making a market entry, is it?. Moreover EMA Lines are crossing downwards (not upwards). Read a little the Market Examples![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1). All will getting clear. TCT is easy and simple to understand.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
Could you post the currency pair and the dimension on your chart next time, please.  
  
Thank you!  
  
See chart below, please. All trades have running in the win zone! Don't complicate the trading system, please. Let it easy and simple!![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Preferred Trades: P1 (Long), P2 (Long), P3 (Exit & Short), P4 (Short), P5 (Exit & Long), P6 (Long)  
  
  
Daily chart:  
If you take a look at the Daily all will getting clearer. EMA Lines are crossing and moving upwards. May be we could se a range in this environment, say at H1/H4 ups and downs and ups and downs and are waiting for the next breakout. TCT used a multiple time frame analysis, before the entering of trades. All is written at this thread. You have only to read and think a little about it. It is really simple.   
  
Kindest regards.

CCI(14) Bottom.  
  
Enter Long at Daily without waiting for a H4 CCI(14) Bottom once again?  
  
May be Enter Long with 1 position? If yes, then not with the H4 argument, more with the power of the daily option.

****Forex Trend Continuation: The Flag Pattern****  
  
  
Forex traders who use technical analysis should be familiar with the chart patterns that confirm and reinforce the existing trends. Those formations are generally known as **continuation patterns**. The most common of them are flags, triangles and wedges.   
**Flag Continuation Pattern**  
  
The **flag** formation gives signals for the direction and the target price.   
This chart pattern represents a short consolidation period formed within a sharp price movement. A support line and a resistance line provide the borders of the consolidation until the price breaks out. These lines are parallel to each other or as in some cases happen slightly converge to one another, which makes the formation appear as a flag. Additionally, generally the flag is not perfectly flat, but tends to be sloped in the reverse direction from the slope of the original trend. The sharp trend that comes before it looks like a flagpole.   
  
[http://www.forex-trading-gurus.com/a...on-pattern.gif](http://www.forex-trading-gurus.com/assets/images/flag-continuation-pattern.gif)   
  
The flag continuation pattern is considered complete when the price breaks out in the same direction of the sharp price movement preceding the pattern. The breakthrough should be accompanied by heavy market volume in order to increase the significance of the chart pattern.

****Forex Trend Continuation: The Pennant Pattern****  
  
Similar to the flag chart formation, the **pennant continuation pattern** is guided by almost the same principles. The only difference between the two is that the support and resistance lines converge, which makes this continuation pattern to appear as a pennant.   
Pennants can be either bullish or bearish. A chart pattern of a _bullish pennant_ is observed when the original trend is bullish as well. On the other hand, a _bearish pennant_ is observed under the conditions of a going down original trend. In both cases it is vital that the movement of the price preceding the pennant formation be a solid, steep move.   
  
  
  
[http://www.forex-trading-gurus.com/a...on-pattern.gif](http://www.forex-trading-gurus.com/assets/images/pennant-continuation-pattern.gif)   
  
The pennant direction is not that important as is the case of the flag pattern, though generally the pennant is flat.   
The pennant continuation pattern is considered complete when the breakout of the price is in the same direction of the steep price movement prior the formation. Additionally, there has to be heavy market volume during the breakout in order to confirm the chart pattern.

Cable is around 150 pips from a double top and cci shows signs of down turn.  
Also forming a saucer pattern which could mean a retrace.

euro has broken out and since it and cable often travel simular paths, It looks like it could pullback also. How far I dont know. Im inclined to think cable and euro a small pullback and then cable breaks out like euro already has. Of course you need to watch for a pullback bottom and then take them long with a close stop. Im not sure the major downtrend on cable is over.  
  
Any thoughts?  
  
I didnt make it but there is also divergence on the euro 4hr.

USDCHF, Weekly has reached the -1/8 "Overshoot level" murrey math.   
  
If EURUSD don't slide in the H4 range 1.36/1.37 - 1.4050/1.4250 any longer, a breakout USDCHF could be possible.

Low Risk Account  
  
In the next time I intend to open a 50'000.-$ Demo Account and will generate 250.-$ a day with Time Cell Trading, so 5'000.- a month.  
  
You could keep an eye on myfxbook.com or twitter about all the trades.   
  
Give me some feedbacks, please, if there are any interest of it around FF.  
  
Kindest regards

Extreme Overshoot Level (murrey Math) and Silver Weekly is forming a divergence.  
May be it's time to enter short.  
I'll take the risk over.

Hi porfirio  
  
Excellent charts!,...but your daily data doesn't show any CCI(14) divergence. Isn't it?  
  
Daily shows a divergence (see first chart, please) and the market price is now at the middle line of the weekly BB (see second chart, please). Could be that prices will struggling around here in the next days?. We don't know. May be!  
  
I would take the profit out of the market and would wait.  
  
In a longer term further upside movements till "MA50 weekly" around 1.63 could be also possible.  
  
GBPCHF seems for me a good currency to trade at Weekly and Daily Charts and sometimes the H4.  
  
Hope it helps!

Examples for M1 Trading  
  
You can also use the Time Cell Trading at M1 and M5.  
Round numbers, EMA Lines, Murrey Math Lines, Pivotal Lines could give you favorite signals for some entry and exit points and the correlation among the currencies like EURUSD & USDCHF, EURUSD & EURJPY,...

If you would trade all the day only at M1 charts your chances for a unprofitable day would increase dramatically. M1 trading could be good enough from time to time with regard at M5 and M15 and the Murrey Math Lines or some EMA's, round numbers, support or resistance, some pivotals and so on. But be aware you doesn't find indicators which are good enough for a constant profit taking!

USDCAD Daily seems to be a favored "profit box"  
  
"CCI Tops and Bottoms Trading" (blue line).  
  
Preferred Trades:  
  
P1(Sell), P2 (Exit & Buy), P3 (Exit & Sell), P4 (Sell), P5 (Exit), P6 (Buy), P7 (Buy), P8 (Buy), P9 (Exit & Sell), P10 (Exit & Buy), P11 (Exit & Sell)  
  
May be: P5 (Buy) and then P9 (Exit) but RSI (red line) is turning down over the Zero Line.  
  
I wish all of you success and hope you're doing well!

NZDJPY, Daily, 2010 November 20  
  
I would prefere to trade the NZDJPY at H4 and the daily chart in the next time twice.  
  
Daily: Daily shows a divergence. Sell at 65.00 with 1 position.   
  
H4: ...and trade the CCI(14) H4 Tops and Bottoms with 2 positions every time.  
  
If market price is running further up take the next sell order at 67.1 with 2 positions.

Often you can follow extremely slumps or rising prices whithin a couple of hours or days at the Forex Market.  
  
Be aware that the Commodity and Forex Market seems to be absolutely a high risk investment!

AUDUSD, Monthly, 2010 November 20  
  
A Murrey Math [+1/8] Overshoot level and a CCI(14) Top should be good arguments to watch at Daily and H4 for some entry shorts.

Hi FXCube,  
  
could you please state what settings (P) you use for the murrey math indicator? With the default setting of 64 I get a different picture...  
  
Thank you and regards,

Manually, due to the fact that a Multiple Time Frame Analyse is made before a trade.   
  
It could be interesting coding a CCI(14) tops and bottom EA for different time frames, furthermore with the BB upper and lower lines. Why not?

EURNZD, Daily, 2010 November 21  
  
With a view to a upward movement some Enter Longs seems for me a favored aspect.

yep its logical ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
but you define step by step all the details of buy and sell entry conditions.  
  
If you define details me or another coder will do this.

Hello hipofiz  
  
Oh that would be fine!  
Many Thanks.  
  
Step 1  
  
May be it could be the first step to define the CCI Tops and Bottoms...may be in conjunction with the upper and lower lines of Bollinger Band, or we define a 100, 150, 200 Line of CCI Top and a -100, -150, -200 Line for the Bottoms, would say it could depend on the algorithm which could be used..  
  
see further #[**841**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4187810&postcount=841), #[**842**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4187827&postcount=842), #[**843**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4187841&postcount=843), #[**844**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4187845&postcount=844), please.

Step 2  
  
EA should be used at all timeframes, say M5, M15, M30, H1, H4, Daily, Weekly, Monthly  
  
I think this point could be difficult if only you'll switch at MT4 through the timecharts. I make an example:  
  
EURUSD: A trader intend to switch at M30, H4 and Daily and at every time if CCI(14) is at his top or his bottom orders will be triggered separately from M30, H4 and Daily. So may be M30 will give a Buy order, so it might be that the Daily EA will give a Sell.  
  
Do you understand what I will explain here?

Step 3  
  
If the first CCI Bottom is reached the EA don't stop then. Often charts will building a next lower Bottom Level (often we could observe a divergence). At this point the EA have to give the second Buy Order.

Step 4  
  
Exit Orders   
by trading the lower timeframes (M5, M15, M30, H1)  
from all Bottom Buy should be triggered at CCI Top (over 100 or 150 er Line).  
  
May be the first 60% at the first CCI Top and the rest of 40% at the second CCI Topet vice versa.

Step 5  
  
Exit, Sell and Buy Orders at higher timeframes, Daily, Weekly, Monthly (may be H4) should be take place like the chart at #[**822**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4186601&postcount=822), say it should be possible, that several buy (or sell) orders at different CCI 14 Bottoms (or Tops) could be done and then one Exit at a CCI 14 Top (or Bottom), may be at once with the next Sell (Buy) Order.

I think it couldn't be so difficult. Why? It is a simple strategy and *.mq4 is C++.  
  
I have a influenza for several days now, may be another trader could ask Steve. When I'm feeling better I would apply to Steve.  
  
Hit the pillow now!  
  
See you.

An EA works only definite items. We (or you or steve) must determine every step, every process for trading idea.   
for example you will to teach a person your idea step by step every process... (crossing and comparison of values is basic term but to execute a process is not )  
yes its C++ but to write an EA is more complex than to create an idea  
( even steve's a lot of EA' on FF is under development for a couple of weeks, I follow up nanningbob thread EA for 1 months)  
  
  
But we must begin to write EA.

NZDUSD, 2010 November 22  
  
H4 is showing a divergence, but Daily and Weekly didn't show clear signal.  
The "overshoot level" [+1/8] Murrey Math has been reached since 2 weeks.  
  
Take the risk over with enter short, while the monthly price action has touched the upper line of Bollinger Band (BB).

Hi hipofiz  
  
So let's start. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Everybody around here can put his ideas at this board to develop this "CCI-Top & Bottom" EA.  
  
How should we call this EA?  
  
CCITB?

Hi FXcube,  
  
really great result!! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
Can you tell me what timeframes you have used for your entries/exits of the closed trades of today? If I look into my charts (I still learn and will begin to trade your system soon), I guess it was M30 and/or H1, right?  
  
Have you only traded the CCI tops/bottoms?  
  
Thank you for a short response,  
Oliver

Hello Oliver  
  
see #[**869**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4190283&postcount=869), please.  
  
I have trade only the Tops and Bottoms. ...and take a look at PhAnTi's comment, please, #[**867**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4190227&postcount=867), #[**871**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4190355&postcount=871)   
When you take a look at  
[http://www.myfxbook.com/members/Fore...250--day/64861](http://www.myfxbook.com/members/Forexcube/250--day/64861)  
you can open the History File and take a look at the time Buy/Sell and Exit.  
  
There are some orders from last week and orders from last night.   
Often I trade the H4 with regard to Daily and if I could die of boredom I trade some M1/M5 between them.  
  
Some of these orders are posted here on board.  
  
The open orders EURJPY from 18.11. and USDJPY from 19.11 was M1/M5 trading but haven't get any chance to close these ones last week. So I let it run and will hedge these one, if it should be necessary.   
  
In detail I can't remember me. I make a lot of analyses and then if I have found a chart with higher probabilitites I go in - here and there I put these ones at this board.  
  
Hope it helps!  
  
Kindest regards  
FXcube

supplement  
That you can do. If I trade M30/H1 I take a look at H4 and Daily. So you can trade with the higher trend. Or trade the Market Entries at H4 and Exits at H1 if they are running in the win, or H1 entry and if there will be a trend exit at H4. TCT CCI(14) Multiple Time Frame is extremely creative, I think. The main issue should be the MM.

Oh yes, of course. Thank you PhAnTi'. I've forget to point it out.  
Often you can monitor these support and resistance levels at the higher charts (H4, Daily, may be H1).  
Sure!

Great, thank you for the explanations. Very helpful. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
There are two more questions I was thinking about****:

  1. At what time frames do you look at the Murrey Math lines (together with the CCI tops/bottoms)?
  2. When do you use stop losses and when not? In your post #836 you advised using a stop loss for example. In other post you talk about the non-stoploss-concept...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)

Thank you once more.

i'll represtn forexcube from now : D  
he doesn't like SLs ....  
try to figure out Murrey Math lines on the higher frames, starting with h1 or h4.... M30 M15 murrey lines dont represent strong support/resistance levels , problem : u cannot play them out cause they wont hold often....the levels on the higher frames demonstrate a very strong obstacle :-] 

Hero calls followed by margin calls...

This example below is a classical one. H1 is showing a divergence and the price action is making the case for a down. In this case [8/8] seems okay for me. If prices would run further upwards I would take the risk over with some enter sells more at [2/8] but would switches at higher timeframes H4 and Daily to consider the situation. Murrey Math seems good in all cases if the chart will tell you this. Sometimes it is H1, H4 and at odd moments Daily and Weekly, (seldom the monthly chart but if so then it could be an extremely great argument for some market actions). It's not a hard rule from me, more an option which I can follow, if price action and the multiple time frame analysis in conjunction with CCI(14) Top or Bottom could give me a clear picture and then Murrey Math could give me one conclusive argument more.

Empirically 80% of all my loosing trades should run sooner or later in a win. Why cut them in a loosing zone before? The rest of 20% of these trades could pose a threat to an account. But often these trades could be hedged several times in the meantime and with higher lot sizes to counterbalance and moderate the damage. Once time in a month or former there is one day to settle the balance. If so the account go e.g. 20% down, but then you have make a multiple of them before. This is only my personal trading style and I can't it recommend to other traders. I think brokers make here his 70% of all wins, due to the fact that the account holder should often undercapitalized.  
  
If I talk about a stop loss I would denote that if I would set a stop loss then here or there. This is for traders who set a stop loss and they know then my mind.  
  
Hope it helps!  
  
Kindest regards

Silver, Weekly, 2010 November 23  
  
has reached the "Extreme Overshoot" [+2/8] and is setting on the watchlist.  
  
CCI(14) is descending from 200 to 110 now and is showing a divergence by comparing with the ascending market price in the last ten weeks.  
  
Take the risk over with one tenth of sell positions (2/10) - Longer Term Trade. (If not so, then I would hedge this position around 29.80).

Open Positions  
  
Be careful!![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
6 Positions à 0.5 Lot USDCHF seems really a little too much for a 60'000.-$ Account. I take the risk over and trade some of them longer term and will earn the carry trades (okay carra trades aren't vera much). If market will go contrary some positions should be hedged. So maximum 30'000.-$ could be risk if market price should go down till 0.8905 (actual 0.9890). If price would run further down till 0.7905 so there could be necessary a sum of 60'000.-$ exclusively for this 6 USDCHF positions if I don't want a undercapitalized account.

Hi FXcube,  
  
your results are amazing...!! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f633.png?v=15.1) ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
Wow, cannot believe what I see...I hope you do the same trades on your live account...or were the trades high risk?  
  
As the most trades closed today were EURUSD and USDCHF, I would guess you traded M1 timeframe (due to the low spread). Is my guess right?  
  
Keep on doing what you do...I appreciate really much what you share with the community here on FF. There is so much to learn from you. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f647-200d-2642-fe0f.png?v=15.1)  
  
I like to review your trades every single day and keep on learning the TCT style more and more.   
  
Kind regards,  
Oliver

Profit Today: 1'479 pips  
  
<http://twitter.com/forexcube>  
  
  
but don't trust results like that.  
see how myfxbook miscalculate.  
"Closed Sell 0.5 Lots GER30D 6810.0 for +750.0 pips, total for today +937.0 pips [ vor ungefähr 12 Stunden](http://twitter.com/Forexcube/status/6971828308279296) via [Myfxbook](https://www.myfxbook.com/)"  
  
So if you see many Forex Managers with big Pip results, may be a part could spring from this kind of current practrice.  
...or to discover a real high deficit.  
  
Real profit without this position (./. 750):

Hi Oliver  
  
Developing your trading plan will take time. Developing skills will take time.   
Waiting for the right trades requires patience. Entering and exiting a trade at the right moment requires patience.   
  
explicit recommendation:  
risk...risk...risk...risk...

GBPUSD, Daily, 2010 November 24  
_  
How to analyse the market?  
Use the Multiple Time Frames (MTF)_  
  
GBPUSD has work out a divergence. EMA100 seems to be a support line.  
  
Stop Loss: somewhere under this EMA 100 Line.  
  
Take the risk with an enter long at the bottom of Daily CCI(14).  
  
Weekly (#[**906**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4194747&postcount=906)) and monthly chart (#[**905**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4194735&postcount=905)) seems a little indifferent. May be good time for Box Trading at H4 till the next breakout, see #[**904**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4194724&postcount=904), please.

Multiple Time Frame Analysis  
Multiple Time Frame Analysis is the practice of analyzing a currency pair by looking at the same pair through several different time frames on charts. The advantage here is that by looking at a larger time frame, then a smaller time frame, and then an even smaller time frame, the trader is able to gain a more granular insight as to how the pair is moving and make a more informed entry into the trade.

**Multiple time-frame indicators**  
by Tomasz Janeczko, amibroker.com  
  
_Requirements to run formulas presented in this article:_

  1. _AmiBroker (any edition, any version above 4.41)_
  2. _any 1-minute intraday data source_

**Introduction**  
In classical approach trader chooses his/her “favorite” time interval(s) and applies tools and indicators in this time frame.   
This approach however generates several questions:  

  1. Which time frame (interval) should I use?
  2. Is choosen interval the best in terms of trading performance?
  3. If not, how can I find better intervals?
  4. Once I have optimum how long will it work?
  5. What to do when once found optimum changes?

These questions are traditionally solved using optimization over time frame, so we build a system that we later test on each and every time frame starting from 1 minute to say one day and choose the best performing one.   
Unfortunately usefulness of such approach can be questioned because once optimum values can become invalid very quickly and frequent re-optimization is simply repetitive curve-fitting over and over again.  
So what is the solution? Should we just stick to our once “favorite” all the time? Is there any other way?****  
  
The idea****  
The proposal of the solution that will be presented here can be summarized in one sentence: instead of using one time frame use all possible time frames (within some range) at once in the form of composite indicator.  
Classic indicators produce signal in the form of single “buy” or “sell” at a time. In voting-based _multiple time frame indicators_ we will blend (compose) the signals coming from hundreds of different time frames into one indicator that will represent a result of “voting” for buy or sell in different intervals.****  
  
Multiple time-frame MACD****  
The construction of multiple time-frame indicator consists of 4 stages:  
1\. Definition of signals  
2\. Generation of signals over multiple time frames  
3\. Summing up the signals into composite indicator  
4\. Normalization  
In the first example we will show how to calculate multiple time-frame MACD.  
In the first step we define our buy and sell rules. For this example, we will use MACD system that generates “BUY” signal when MACD is above zero and “SELL” signal when MACD is below zero.  
In the second step we run MACD over every time frame ranging from 10-minute to 300 minutes, each interval generating its own buy and sell signals.  
In the third step we count each buy as +1 and each sell as -1 and calculate sum of those signals coming from different time frames.  
And in the last stage we normalize the indicator by dividing the sum calculated in previous step by number of time frames we used.   
This way we obtain bounded multiple-timeframe indicator ranging from -1 to +1 that represents a “blend” of signals coming from multiple time frames at once. Positive values represent composite buy signal while negative values represent composite sell signal.   
Below is a sample Amibroker code that actually calculates multiple-time frame MACD. As you can see the coding is pretty simple and short, because of Amibroker native support for handling multiple time frames. These TimeFrame functions allow the user to mix different intervals in single formula with ease. Since the formula is rather computationally intensive we perform calculation once and store results in artificial data symbol (using AddToComposite function) that we will use later for plotting (so it does not need to be re-calculated).  
_Formula 1. Multiple time-frame MACD. Note: in order to run this code and calculate multiple time-frame MACD, enter it into Automatic Analysis (AA) window, go to Settings window, make sure that Periodicity is set to 1-minute. Then press "Scan" button in the AA window._  
Count = 0;   
result = 0;   
  
**for**( i = 10; i <= 300; i++ )   
{   
TimeFrameSet( i * **in1Minute** );   
m = MACD(12, 26 );   
TimeFrameRestore();   
m = IIf( TimeFrameExpand( m, i * **in1Minute** ) > 0, 1, -1 );   
result = result + m;   
Count++;   
}   
  
AddToComposite( result / Count, "~MACD"+Name(), "X" );   
**Buy** =1;  
  
In the figure below we can see daily chart of ORCL (upper pane) with buy and sell arrows generated using multiple time-frame MACD and multiple time-frame MACD indicator plotted in the bottom pane. Buy signal is generated when MTMACD crosses above -0.5 line and sell is generated when MTMACD drops below +0.5 line. Note the MTMACD saturation levels at -1 and +1 which indicate bars when all timeframes voted for sell or for buy.   
  
[http://www.amibroker.com/docs/MTFInd...TMACD-ORCL.png](http://www.amibroker.com/docs/MTFIndicators/P_CTMACD-ORCL.png)   
  
Actual plotting code is presented below. Note that we are using Foreign function to retrieve indicator values stored in artificial ticker. That way we don't need to re-calculate it.  
_Formula 2. Multiple time frame MACD plot (indicator) code. Use Formula editor to enter then press "Apply indicator" to display it._  
x = Foreign("~MACD"+Name(),"C");   
  
Plot( x, "MTMACD", **colorBlue** , **styleThick** ) ;   
  
PlotGrid(0.5 );   
PlotGrid(-0.5);  
  
****Extreme overbuy/oversell indicator (Multiple time-frame RSI)****  
In second example we will present an indicator that could be called “extreme overbought/oversell” indicator. It’s construction we will use RSI indicator to detect overbuy/oversell conditions occuring in different time frames. Overbuy signal will be generated when 14 bar RSI is above 70 and oversell will be generated when RSI is below 30. INnthe second step we will generate RSIs in every interval starting from 5 minute, through 10-, 15-, 20-, 25-, 30, 35- minute interval up to 360 minutes.   
In the third step we will add 1 to the sum if RSI in given time frame is above 70, or subtract 1 from the sum if RSI in given time frame is below 30.  
After calculating entire sum we will divide the result by number of components.   
This will give us bounded indicator in -1… + 1 range, where values near -1 will signify extreme oversell and values near +1 will signify extreme overbuy.  
_Formula 3. Multiple time frame RSI. As before, run the formula in AA window using 1-minute periodicity selected in the Settings._  
Count = 0;   
result = 0;   
  
**for**( i = 5; i <= 360; i = i + 5 )   
{   
TimeFrameSet( i * **in1Minute** );   
m = RSI();   
TimeFrameRestore();   
  
m = TimeFrameExpand( m, i * **in1Minute** );   
  
result = result + IIf( m > 70, 1, IIf( m < 30, -1, 0 ) );   
Count++;   
}   
  
AddToComposite( result / Count, "~RSI"+Name(), "X" );   
**Buy** =1;  
The code that plots actual indicator is as follows.  
_Formula 4._  
x = Foreign("~RSI"+Name(),"C");   
**GraphZOrder** =1;   
  
Plot( x, "MTRSI", **colorLightGrey** );   
Plot( EMA(x, 7 ), "EMA(MTRSI,7)", **colorBlue** , **styleThick** );   
  
PlotGrid(1);   
PlotGrid(-1);  
  
[http://www.amibroker.com/docs/MTFInd...CTRSI_CSCO.png](http://www.amibroker.com/docs/MTFIndicators/P_CTRSI_CSCO.png)   
  
In the figure above we can see daily chart of CSCO plus extreme overbuy/oversell (light gray) and its 7 day moving average (blue). As we can see from the chart smoothed MTRSI peaks and troughs precisely show ends of large up trend and down trend moves. One stunning feature of this indicator is clarity of trend-ending signals. This indicator is perfect for timing the exits. As many researches have shown good exit timing is often more important than entry timing.   
  
[http://www.amibroker.com/docs/MTFInd...CTRSI_AAPL.png](http://www.amibroker.com/docs/MTFIndicators/P_CTRSI_AAPL.png)   
  
In this figure above you can see another example of MTRSI with very clear signals of local maximums during the trend. Even more stunning is the divergence that develops in the middle of September when prices continue to rise and MTRSI makes two peaks in clear downtrend. These leading signals helped to get out of trade just at the very end of very nice up trend.  
  
****Multiple time-frame ADX****  
Using the same concept we can create other multiple-time frame indicators. For example MTADX presented in this chart, was calculated by computing 14-bar ADX values in every time frame starting from 20 minutes upto 360 minutes with 20 minute increment and then summing them up and dividing by number of components.   
_Formula 5. Multiple time-frame ADX calculation_  
Count = 0;   
result = 0;   
  
**for**( i = 20; i <= 360; i = i + 20 )   
{   
TimeFrameSet( i * **in1Minute** );   
m = ADX();   
TimeFrameRestore();   
  
m = TimeFrameExpand( m, i * **in1Minute** );   
result = result + m;   
Count++;   
}   
AddToComposite( result / Count, "~ADX"+Name(), "X" );   
**Buy** =1;  
_Formula 6. Multiple time-frame ADX plot_  
x = Foreign("~ADX"+Name(),"C");   
  
Plot( x, "MTADX", **colorBlue** , **styleThick** ) ;  
  
[http://www.amibroker.com/docs/MTFInd..._CTADX_NDX.png](http://www.amibroker.com/docs/MTFIndicators/P_CTADX_NDX.png)  
  
This has yielded to the indicator plotted in second pane. ADX is the indicator that shows how strong is the trend. As we can see multiple time-frame ADX very quickly reacts to forming uptrend, much quicker than original 14-day ADX (shown in the lowest pane). For illustration purposes in the middle I have inserted 4-day ADX which still lags behind multiple-time frame 14-bar ADX and is more choppy.  
MTADX shows weakening of market trend way quicker.  
This shows clear advantage of multiple-time frame indicators. They are leading indicators.

****  
Multiple time-frame, multiple-security composites****  
As I have shown previously multiple time frame indicators often provide leading signals and this makes them better than those based on end-of-day data, however, sometimes they lead only by very few bars. For example take a look at multiple time-frame MACD generated from Nasdaq 100 index compared to regular MACD (below). In most cases it leads standard MACD just by 1-3 bars. It is nice, but couldn’t this be nicer?   
  
[http://www.amibroker.com/docs/MTFInd...CTMACD_NDX.png](http://www.amibroker.com/docs/MTFIndicators/P_CTMACD_NDX.png)   
  
The answer is.... Yes they can do better work ... If you trade sector EFTs or index futures.   
When one trades an index or some sector, it is popular practice to apply indicators on index data. Index is usually some form of average of its components. As an alternative to applying indicator to market average we can create average from indicators calculated separately for each component. As long as indicator does not represent simple linear transformation these two procedures yield to very different results. For example if we assign „buy” and „sell” meaning to certain indicator levels we can implement voting across securities that build up an index. This technique is now widely used among AmiBroker users because its’ built-in support for creating user-definable composites and the fact that it requires just one line of code to create composite in AmiBroker.  
Creation of composite:  
[http://www.amibroker.com/docs/MTFInd...s/image012.gif](http://www.amibroker.com/docs/MTFIndicators/image012.gif)   
But during this research we went further than that. We did not only created a multiple-security composite but we have used multiple time-frame indicators as components of such composite. So each "MACD" block in the schematics above represents multiple-time frame MACD calculated from single security.  
  
So this time voting is performed first in time-frame domain and then in security domain and results are summed up to construct one indicator which we can call multiple time frame MACD composite.  
  
[http://www.amibroker.com/docs/MTFInd...CTMACD_NDX.png](http://www.amibroker.com/docs/MTFIndicators/P_CompositeCTMACD_NDX.png)   
  
Here is how it looks. The middle pane shows multiple-time frame MACD composite calculated from MTMACDs computed for every Nasdaq100 component separately, then summed up together and divided by 100.   
As you can see it is very different from single-security multiple-timeframe MACD. It is also very different from regular MACD calculated from index data directly. And what is most important - it leads the market movement by significantly more bars than its single-security counterpart.  
Strong divergences show clearly trend change and levels of -0.5 and +0.5 show strong support and resistance.  
  
[http://www.amibroker.com/docs/MTFInd...iteEOD_NDX.png](http://www.amibroker.com/docs/MTFIndicators/P_CompositeEOD_NDX.png)   
  
This chart shows comparison between composite based on multiple time frames (bottom pane) and composite based on end-of-day data (middle pane)  
It is quite clear that multiple-time frame composite reacts much faster and also divergences shown here are clearer and easier to interpret.   
Multiple time-frame indicators have zero or negative lag giving you an early alert for market reversal and allowing to trade before reversal actually happens.  
AFL implementation is very easy and straightforward thanks to unique AmiBroker function AddToComposite. All it requires is one line of code that how individual component value is calculated and one AddToComposite line. Then such code is run over watch list of securities in AmiBroker’s Automatic Analysis window.  
_Formula 6. EOD composite generation. This formula should be run on watch list containing the members of Nasdaq 100 index._  
AddToComposite( IIf( MACD() > 0, 1, 0), "~~Nasdaq_EOD_MACD", "X");   
**Buy** =0;  
In multiple-time frame case we need to run the code over previously created artificial tickers that contain MTMACD values. So there are two passes: first pass to create MTMACDs for components using code presented few minutes earlier and second pass using this code that creates actual composite.  
Computations are stored in artificial ticker that can be used anytime later without need to repeat calculations over and over again. This is quite important considering the fact that creation of individual MTMACDs for over 100 of symbols may take several minutes (depening on computer speed).   
_Formula 7. Multiple time frame composite generation. This formula should be run on the watch list containing only artificial tickers (starting with ~MACD) generated using Formula 1._  
AddToComposite( **C** , "~~Nasdaq100MT_MACD", "X");   
**Buy** =0;  
To plot multiple time frame MACD composite the following formula should be used.   
_  
Formula 7. Multiple time-frame MACD composite plot_  
x = Foreign("~~Nasdaq100MT_MACD","C")/100;   
  
Plot( x, "Nasdaq MTMACD", **colorBlue** , **styleThick** ) ;   
  
PlotGrid(0.5 );   
PlotGrid(0);   
PlotGrid(-0.5);  
  
****Advantages and disadvantages****  
The multiple time-frame indicators I have presented here have many important advantages. First of all they provide leading trading signals.  
Signals are provided in a clear way (for example extreme overbuy/oversell shows clear spikes on trend endings) so they can be interpreted easily even in automatic way. Multiple time frame indicators work on any kind of market as they basically use just 1-minute price series. Composite flavour of multiple time frame indicators is very useful for trading sector funds and/or index futures.   
There are also some disadvantages of multiple time frame indicators but these are minor computer-related issues.  
First of all these indicators are computationally intensive as they operate on lots of data and require often several minutes to calculate.  
Also they require historical intraday data which may be a bit more expensive than end-of-day data  
And the last thing is that computations shown here can be peformed only using program that is capable of manipulating multiple time frames at once and having ability to automatically compute and store composites (cross-security sums or averages). Good news is that AmiBroker is one of such sofwares and it is not expensive :-)  
  
****Possible improvements****  
As you can see multiple time frame indicators have lot of good things to offer, but let us think about future possible enhancements.  
These improvements may include using different weight to each „vote”. The simplest way is to give more weight to longer time frames. More complex way would be to use weight that depends on past performance of particular time-frame. This way better-performing time-frames become more important in producing final signal than the others (worse-performing). This however resembles slightly constant re-optimization and such weight modification should be limited so we don’t end up in one time frame monopolising the system.  
  
**Conclusion**  
Multiple time frame indicators present interesting alternative to using "classic" indicators computed from EOD data. Position and swing traders may benefit from including them in their toolbox, since multiple time frame indicators react to market changes way faster than their EOD counterparts while still filtering most of the market noise present in smaller time frames.

...and now you have to wait with M1 Range Box Trading.  
H1 has just reached the middle line of Bollinger Band, so may be it's better to switch at M5/M15 and look here a little with recurring opportunities at M1 (recourses), ..., but every trader has his own concept,...thankfully!

Counterbalance your account - so can you!  
  
M1 trading could be a good way to counterbalance some open minus positions.  
When I saw that "Ger30dec10" was moving in the opposite direction I've make up my mind either I hedge or I enforce "M1 High Lot Size Trading" (HLT). see #[**912**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4197147&postcount=912).  
  
...if you trade at the beginner level, ...may be that sometimes it could be a little airbone. May be that there aren't so much traders who could have the basic advanced skills to trade like #[**912**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4197147&postcount=912), isn't it?  
  
For an well advanced trader it seems not so dangerous to counterbalance negative positions with "M1 high lot size trading" (HLT) from time to time.  
  
I have make up my mind that "Ger30dec10" could moving down stright away but I don't know the point in time. So I don't want to hedge this position and take the action alternative to settle the minus position with M1 Trading in other currency pairs or commodities, like #[**912**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4197147&postcount=912).

**Trading Using Multiple Time Frames**  
  
by Umashankar Galla  
  
  
**Note: there are many forex systems that trade with more than 1 time frame. Why? It is usually to accurately time the entry to make the trade a "high probability" trade. Some systems however only trade one time frame such as daily systems as they look for broader and bigger moves in the currency market. Here's the article by Umashankar:****Why do we need to Trade Using Multiple Timeframes?**  
  
To improve the efficiency of our trading strategy. We see the major Trend using a higher time frame than what we intend to use & a lower Time frame to enter a trade.  
Say we want to trade using the Daily Charts. We take the Weekly charts to see the major trend. Suppose it's an uptrend in a Weekly chart. We will tend to trade only long positions. We will use entries in the daily charts to enter long positions only. When sell signals are generated we will just exit our long positions. I.e. we don't short sell.  
Suppose it's a downtrend in a Weekly chart. We will tend to trade only short positions. We will use a entries in the daily charts to enter short positions only. When buy signals are generated we will just exit our short positions. I.e. we don't enter long positions.  
Now that we are using two timeframes. Now coming to timing the entry of trades or adding additional positions. (Pyramiding). We can further use a Hourly chart to time our entries. Suppose the weekly & daily charts are in a uptrend. We will enter a long position or an additional long position when a hourly chart gives us a buy signal. Suppose the weekly & daily charts are in a downtrend. We will enter a short position or an additional short position when a hourly chart gives us a sell signal. This timeframe would not be used to exit the trades. It's solely to improve the timing for entry. For exits we would use the signals generated in the daily charts.  
  
**Using multiple time frames to trade.**  
We take three charts of the same security. First is the weekly chart. Next chart is the daily chart. Third chart is the hourly chart.  
We will now use the daily chart to trade. We check the weekly chart for the weekly trend. Lest assume the weekly trend is up. So based on this information we will just trade long positions in the daily chart.  
We look for a buy opportunity in the daily chart or we can see the hourly chart to enter a long position.  
Now for entering additional positions we use buy opportunities in the hourly chart. We would exit based on the daily chart only, because we were trading based on the daily chart.  
  
Similarly we can trade short where weekly charts are in a downtrend and daily chart generates sell opportunity. Additional positions are entered whenever sell opportunities are generated on the hourly charts.  
  
For Day trading we can use the Hourly, 15 Min and 5 Min charts here we trade the 15 Min chart. Or we can use 15 Min, 5 Mins and 3 Mins charts here we trade the 5 Mins chart.

Short Note  
  
If I make the MTFA I will choose the Monthly, Weekly, Daily And H4 in one group at first and will initially analyse this rhythm. Next I added the lower timeframes like M30m M15, M5 and M1.  
  
Then I ask some question?  
  
Are there any pattern detection?   
  
Which ones could be score stronger?  
  
How many timeframes do I really use by the next market entry (entries)? Select the right ones!  
  
Is there uncetainty about whether...? If yes, then I try to point it out. Will be there profound arguments I avoid this currency pair at the moment. Waiting is the first skill that a trader could learn if he will get a successful trader! If you can't wait than you have to learn this basic skill with exercices like meditation or so. Keep the market waiting ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)!  
  
Are there any disturbance, turmoil around you or in yourself go out of the market and make some other nice things in your life. The Market can wait. There will be plenty of other chances next time! Why would you destroy yourself with autoaggressive silly behavior...instead of an inviting, disarming smile?  
  
Don't trade when you add alcoholic drinks. Two times a day it's better to make fruit juice by own pressed fruit with a fruitpress.   
Recipe: 1 liter fruit juice - 1 kg carrots, 2 oranges, 2 chubby pineapple slices, half plum-sized of ginger, 1/2 lemon, 4 apples, 1 kiwi. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

EURUSD, Daily, 2010 November 25  
  
If daily support line (resistance from 2010.08.08) will be broken further downside movements could be possible, in contrast CCI(14) is at the bottom.  
  
The last monthly candles are struggling around the middle line of Bollinger Band, whereas the weekly bar are just hitting the middle line of BB.  
  
Good time for a M30 trading. Here you can trade the CCI(14) ups and downs (see #[**921**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4199258&postcount=921) or more in detail below, please) and wait for a bigger breakout.  
  
If big charts (like Weekly or Monthly, see#[**920**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4199251&postcount=920) , please) are reaching imortant fields (e.g. Lines of BB, support or resistance) the chance increases that we could see a range box in the following days.

...so this one closed position was an absolute error!  
  
It has to do that I switch inadvertantly at the PC "enter" bottom out of position (3 PC's were running) during a telephone session.  
It's not my spirit waiting over 13 hours with a position to end it with a small loss.  
  
_...so what I can say to myself, may be something like this?![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

EURJPY, H4, 2010 November 25  
  
CCI(14) at a top at H4. Not a real good thing because daily is at its bottom (CCI) but weekly is crossing the zero line (see #[**927**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4200179&postcount=927), please). I take the risk over with 2 positions Enter Short near 111.70 (two tenth of a trade, if 1 trade should be 10 positions, themed under "add-up positions, #[**226**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3953542&postcount=226)).  
  
...even better to trade M15, M30 or H1 with regard at H4 whilst taking into account of the "controverse" output of the Daily (may be we'll see a double CCI(14) daily top next time. We don't know).  
  
Be careful and set a stop loss a little above H4 EMA20 or around 112.03 Pivot (DR1).  
  
Have good sport!

Hello gio.kele  
  
We all have our native language and it is a great honor for me to read your comments here on board.  
  
In Forex Trading we should have learn to calculate only with estimated probabilities, which can't never be the holy grale of a safe investment to 1.0  
  
When I post these multiple time frame analyses I will convey this meaning here on board. Hope it's easy to understand.  
  
Wish you success and happiness!  
  
Kindest regards  
FXcube

**How to Use Multi Time Frame Analysis When Trading Forex, Futures, and Stocks**  
  
  
In our last lesson we learned about support and resistance and how to spot these levels in the market. We should now have a good understanding of how to spot trends in the market, some of the components that make up those trends, and finally how to recognize support and resistance levels. Now lets tie everything together we have learned thus far with the final concept of this series, **Multi Time frame analysis**.  
No matter what time frame you end up using when trading the stock, futures or forex market or what time frame a particular strategy calls for, it is important always to have a big picture overview of what is happening in the market. Although there are exceptions, in general most traders will tell you that if your trade setup or analysis lines up on multiple time frames, then the odds of being correct are greatly increased.  
Lets look at a simple example by looking for a trade to place to take advantage of a trend that we have spotted on a chart. For this example lets say we are looking at a 5 minute chart of the EUR/USD.  
  
  
**A 5 Minute EUR/USD Chart**  
  
<http://s1.hubimg.com/u/149744_f520.jpg>   
  
A 5 Minute Forex Chart   
  
  
As you can see from the above chart if we were just looking at the EUR/USD 5 minute chart then we would note the downtrend in the market and sticking to the simple strategy of simply following the trend, we would look for opportunities to sell into the downtrend.  
As we want to have a better feeling for the general direction of the market however when we place this trade we next take a look at an hourly chart.  
  
  
**A 1 Hour EUR/USD Chart**  
  
<http://s2.hubimg.com/u/149745_f520.jpg>   
  
A 1 Hour Forex Chart   
  
  
As we can see from this chart we also spot a longer term downtrend on the hourly chart thus giving us more confidence in our potential trade into the downtrend on the 5 minute chart.  
Lastly to make sure that we are getting the full picture we pull up a daily chart.  
  
  
**A Daily EUR/USD Chart**  
  
<http://s3.hubimg.com/u/149746_f520.jpg>   
  
A Daily Forex Chart  
  
When looking at this chart however we see that not only is the EUR/USD in an uptrend on the daily chart, it is in an extended uptrend. As the daily chart does not line up with the 5 minute and the hourly chart we may want to question whether or not to place the suggested downtrend trade in the face of the large uptrend on the longer term chart.  
Now that we understand how a trading signal in the stock, futures, or forex market can be considered “stronger” if it lines up on multiple time frames, a more prudent way to search for potential trades may be to start by looking at the longer term time frames, and then look for opportunities on shorter term charts which are in line with what the longer term charts are showing.  
The same concept applies when looking at support and resistance. In general the more time frames and the longer the time frame is that a support or resistance level shows up on the more “valid” that level is considered.  
That’s our lesson for today. You should now have a good understanding of multiple time frame analysis and how looking at different time frames can give us more or less confidence in trades we are considering making.

Minimise the open position before week-end could be not so bad!  
  
Daily Silver has reached the middle line of Bollinger Band and Murrey Math [+1/8] "Overshoot Level". So I take the risk over and go out with the Enter Short trade today. May be Silver would falling hard down over the week-end by crossing the double-line . If so then my long order would get a problem and I could have the management next week to counterbalance this position at Monday nov.'29. I don't wish so many open orders at my account over the week-end.

Hi gio.kele  
  
Silver - Careful consideration  
Silver shouldn't be the first choice by undercapitalized accounts. Silver pulverises small accounts earlier than are believed.  
  
Silver Chart  
To improve the efficiency of your trading strategy. You see the major trend using a higher time frame than what you intend to use & a lower time frame to enter a trade. Silver shows at its daily chart a touch down till the middle line of BB. May be it goes now up again. We don't know, but you can follow this price at H4 and M30 or H1 and look if this resistance line (daily EMA20, or H4 EMA100) would be broken further down. If so then probabilities increases for a greater downward movement. But big capital don't give often other traders a clear sign so it could also be that prices will struggling around before it goes a few days later real down. Silver H4 CCI(14) is under 200 line, M5 moves sideways in a range, so I would take a look at M30, H1 and H4 and trade here this indifferent market situation till the breakout down occurs or silver prices would moves up again (see here then E.G. H1 EMA10, if the market price will cross the H4 EMA10 upwards - now price is underneath). If a big trend will come up you can see this at Daily chart earliest a few days later, but previous in smaller timeframes. In the meantime I would trade the H4, H1. If your investment (Long or Short) are after several days at the winner side and bigger time frame will give you the confirmation then I would let the win run further on.  
  
If you think like this:  
**"Using multiple time frames to trade.**  
We take three charts of the same security. First is the weekly chart. Next chart is the daily chart. Third chart is the hourly chart.  
We will now use the daily chart to trade. We check the weekly chart for the weekly trend. Lest assume the weekly trend is up. So based on this information we will just trade long positions in the daily chart. We look for a buy opportunity in the daily chart or we can see the hourly chart to enter a long position. Now for entering additional positions we use buy opportunities in the hourly chart. We would exit based on the daily chart only, because we were trading based on the daily chart."   
**..it's okay.** But when a counter trend is coming up all this explanation don't help you really forward during the radical change. Then it's better to switch at lower timeframes (H4, H1, M30) during the change (rebuilding phase, radical change, inasmuch as strong momentum tends to break support and resistance, weak momentum does not) and trade approximately the smaller time frames as far as the other (recent, fresh, big) trend will become your road map, from then on familiar trading at higher timeframes can be recommended again.   
  
EURUSD Charts  
all okay!  
  
Hope it helps  
  
Nice work with your chart!  
  
Keep it on!

**[Counter Trend](http://www.system-forex.info/2010/03/counter-trend.html) **  
{ Posted on 3/27/2010 08:53:00 PM by De_Trainer }   
...  
Investo-pedia says... Contrarian investors perform counter-trend trading strategies - purchasing shares when prices are low and selling when they're high. The investor receives smaller gains since the full market swing is not recognized. Many counter-trend investors use momentum indicators to determine the best times to execute their trades.   
  
The simple way of counter-trend, that we not recognize the trend, we mostly open position that opposed from direction of trend like we know the turn point, as long market have significant movement, counter trend will be there. When market in sideway condition counter-trend had advantage to sell at high and buy at low, but when market in trending, counter-trend must tight the seat-belt.  
  
[](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_jrfv2L8voQs/S64dPmkn1HI/AAAAAAAAAPo/Ytjnstj6ShU/s1600/trendforex.jpg)[http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_jrfv2L8voQ...trendforex.jpg](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_jrfv2L8voQs/S64dPmkn1HI/AAAAAAAAAPo/Ytjnstj6ShU/s320/trendforex.jpg)  
  
That pic sure give us illustration of real drawdown, especially for Sell, when using counter-trend in trending condition.  
  
Now, i'll show the sample system of counter-trend using MT4...  
  
I use Bollinger Band, why bollinger band?? i think this indicator is reliable to recognize trending or in sideway, in term of Bollinger, trending is... i generally definite trending as condition when price goes out from Low or High 'Bollinger Line', it known as 'Abnormal Condition'. And when the price inside the "cage" of Bollinger Band, the price is in 'Normal Condition'. Normal Condition is the best time for counter-trend trading, because we know when price inside the cage of Bollinger, price will move sideway, in same range movement for a while.

The setup of system :  
  
1\. Bollinger Band Green period 20 (default) and Bollinger Band Blue period 60  
2\. SMA 7 and SMA 10  
  
Rules or trade condition :  
  
1\. Make sure price inside Bollinger Band, also Bollinger Band 20 inside the Bollinger 60  
2\. Make sure both of Bollinger move Flat and not 'Squeeze'  
3\. Tight the SL because we buy at low sell at high, there's no reason for 100 SL  
4\. Lock the pips if afraid to get loss, though it small loss  
  
The entry of buy is :  
  
The slow MA crossed the fast MA, the condition of slow MA is up from fast MA.  
  
The entry of sell is :  
  
The slow MA crossed the fast MA, the condition of slow MA is down from fast MA.  
  
Take Profit when MA crossed to opposite from your trade position, or when touch the Low or High Bollinger.  
  
That's it, hope my article give an inspiration... Let's make good pippin...

**What Does _Countertrend Strategy_ Mean?**  
A trading strategy where an [investor](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/countertrend.asp#) attempts to make small gains through a series of trades against the current trend. It is also known as "counter-trend trading".

**Investopedia explains _Countertrend Strategy_**  
Contrarian [investors](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/countertrend.asp#) perform counter-trend trading strategies - purchasing shares when prices are low and selling when they're high. The investor receives smaller gains since the full market swing is not recognized.   
  
Many counter-trend investors use momentum indicators to determine the best times to execute their trades.

I couldn't agree with him more!  
  
Counter-Trend trades should only constitute roughly 20% or so of your trades, see #[**953**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4202939&postcount=953), please).  
  
Counter Trend Trades could used an infinite deal more by adavanced trading level. In my trading career I have make the first real sustained profit after the third/fourth year of practice, ...and after the fifth/sixth year I have learned the "ease of money" how to increase the risk (higher lot sizes) only for a few minutes. Last one you can do without exception by a big plus account, after you have made big profits before.

When market in sideway condition counter-trend had advantage to sell at high and buy at low, but when market in trending, counter-trend must tight the seat-belt. ( see  #[**947**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4202475&postcount=947) , please).

Bollinger Band Counter Trend System  
Bei dem Bollinger Band Counter Trend System handelt es sich um ein sehr kurzfristiges System, das maximal zwei Tage im Markt ist. Das System kauft in Trendmärkten (ADX(14) > 22) in stark überverkaufte Situationen (unteres Bollinger Band um einen Prozentwert unterschritten) hinein (es werden nur Long Positionen eingegangen), dabei spielt es keine Rolle, ob es sich um einen Aufwärts- oder Abwärtstrend handelt. Da das System gerade in Abwärtstrends gegen den Trend kauft, geht man ein besonderes Risiko ein, man sollte also nur einen geringen Teil des Gesamtkapitals investieren. Weiterhin sind für das System niedrige Gebühren und eine ausreichende Liquidität wichtig, um eine geringe Slippage zu garantieren. Dieses und die grosse Volatilität machen das System ideal für an der Nasdaq gehandelte Aktien, wobei das System durchaus auch in anderen Aktienmärkten funktioniert. Das System hätte auch in der Zeit von Mitte 2000 bis September 2001 mit Long Positionen an der Nasdaq Geld verdient, obwohl in dieser Zeit die Märkte praktisch nur eine Richtung kannten, nämlich nach unten.

**Trend Trading vs. Counter-Trend Trading**  
  
By Todd Mitchell  
Dec 11, 2006 - 11:33:00 PM  
  
Many traders, believe it or not, aren't aware of what we're about to discuss here. Most absolute beginner traders try to catch tops and bottoms in the market, not even trying to trade the TRENDS. We, like many other traders first starting attempted to do the same thing. We know this from not only our own personal experiences, but by teaching and talking to tens of thousands of traders that they tend to do the same thing.   
Many (if not most) traders feel that by trying to catch a market top or bottom is where the real money is. We on the other hand disagree completely. Catching just a little piece of a trend (and sometimes much larger than a little piece) adds up, not to mention easier (higher percentages) to do than trying to catch a top or bottom in the market. So, we thought by including this topic; Trend Trading vs. Counter-Trend Trading would be very helpful to you. We know this will give you more insight into both of these types of trades.  
Let us first start out by saying that at least 80% of your trades should be those trading with the TREND (as taught in this Course - 'Trend Determination', etc.). The other remaining 20% or so can constitute COUNTER TREND (CT) trades. We would highly suggest concentrating more (at least in the beginning) on the TREND trades as opposed to trying to pick tops and bottoms (CT trades). By not only teaching, but by speaking with students, especially beginners, we find that most traders simply just try to pick tops and bottoms as opposed to trying to enter the market with the (overall) TREND.   
We'll go as far as to say you probably will not become a successful trader by trying to pick tops and bottoms when you first start off trading. Counter-Trend (CT) trading takes a lot more experience. Believe us when we say that you'll not only find trading less stressful, but much more rewarding and profitable if you simply stick to trading with a markets (overall) TREND. Look to make consistent profits utilizing the profit objectives (PO's) taught in this Course -- and of course you'll occasionally catch the bigger move (by utilizing the 'Trailing Stop' methods taught in this Course).   
Of the 20% or so of trades that may become COUNTER TREND (CT) trades, 80% of those trades should be BUYS. Why Buys? Simply put, because we've found that BOTTOMS are much easier to pick than tops. If you think about it, the psychology of most traders are more biased to buying the market as opposed to selling the market as a whole. Traders in general seem to be more optimistic rather than pessimistic on the overall market. We've spoken to thousands of traders that have expressed to us that they feel more comfortable buying the market as opposed to selling it. We know that sounds ridiculous, and we agree, but many (if not most) traders, believe it or not, feel this way. That's one of the reasons why bottoms seem to be easier to pick than tops - traders are more prone to Buy than they are to Sell.   
Think about it, how many stock traders do you know that actually sell a stock short? Not many, most stock traders buy stocks in anticipation of higher prices. When the market gets extremely oversold and drops to levels where the big money comes in to Buy the market (oftentimes at a 5%, 10% & 15% overall market corrections), you'll oftentimes see the market move higher (spike up) and continue the markets (stocks) overall UPTREND .   
When the market is in a DOWNTREND, the market not only drops three times quicker than it rises (making it much more volatile), but bottoms are put in place much quicker. This is evident in any chart you look at. On the other hand, when the market is trending up, the market generally moves much slower and much more gradual in nature. Therefore, trying to find market tops are much more difficult to do, at least that's been our personal experience.   
So, when attempting to BUY on a Retest of a Low (important), the market is generally in a Downtrend, and when attempting to SELL on a Retest of a High (important), the market is generally in an Uptrend. By knowing these two simple rules will help make Counter-Trend trading much more predictable in nature, rather than trying to BUY when the market is in a free-fall, or trying to SELL when the market is going to the moon. At most, these rules will help prevent you from jumping in front of a freight train.   
Therefore, I suggest waiting for a RETEST OF A HIGH before looking to go Sell Short. Conversely, wait for a RETEST OF A LOW before looking to go Long. Remember, Counter-Trend trades should only constitute roughly 20% or so of your trades. As mentioned before, CT trades are definitely more difficult than trading with the markets overall TREND.   
A General Rule Of Thumb: When a market is Trending Up, the market tends to be a lot less volatile than when a market is Trending Down. Therefore, generally speaking a Down Trending market is much more volatile than when a market is trending up. A market falls roughly three times quicker than it rises.

Forex Trading - Counter Trend Trading  
  
  
Statistics like "the market only trends 30% to 33% of the time" are thrown around. Whether that's true or not, I don't know. But suppose that the markets trended half of the time. That would still mean the 50% of the time the markets were range-bound.  
I further suspect that the numbers above are correct because of the number of small traders in the forex market. Small traders have a way of disrupting trends. (That's why the large institutional traders don't like them!).  
One way or another, however, we know that the market is trendless a significant amount of time. If you continue to try to trade a trend system during these times, you'll either get no trades (if you're lucky), or you'll get a lot of choppy losing trades.  
A better way to go about this is to use a counter-trend trading system. A counter-trend system looks to do the "impossible". It looks for the high and low in a market. It figures that if it finds a high or low, the market will reverse from there (because it's trendless) and you'll have a good trade.  
So what is a good counter trend trading system? I'd recommend starting with Bollinger bands. The basic principle is to trade tags off of the upper and lower bands.  
However, if the market is in a trend, you'll get eaten alive. So it's necessary that the bands be totally flat or almost flat.  
Yet, still I'd add an oscillator like Stochastic oscillator to help confirm tops and bottoms. One of the beauties of a counter trend system is the ability to use very tight stops. You'd place a stop just outside of the band that had just been tagged. Shoot for a profit target that's just under the middle line of the bands.

GBPUSD, Monthly & Weekly, 2010 November 27  
  
Monthly is in an upward trend (the last candles were making higher highs and lower lows).   
  
Is it then only a pullback! We'll see!  
  
If market prices will turn north again (upwards) then could the condition of a "weekly range box" fullfilled if 1.5250 will not be broken down (current 1.5590).

GBPUSD, Daily & H4, 2010 November 27  
  
GBPUSD Daily chart is showing a divergence. May be take the risk over and trade at H4 some long positions (2-3 positions of 10), if Monday session won't make further downs. Monthly and Weekly are struggling around the middle line of BB (see #[**955**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4202970&postcount=955) , please) so chances could also be for a sideway correction in the following days. We don't know! ... but if so then range box trading could be the first choice. It's just one aspect of this marvellous currency pair.

Five Key Factors that Move the Forex Markets -- and How to Profit from Them  

  

Hi! We're Boris Schlossberg and Kathy Lien, and we've been making people money in Forex for over a decade. As Directors of Currency Research at GFT and long-time [Investopedia.com](http://www.investopedia.com/) contributors, we've seen our share of wins and losses... Thankfully, over the years, we've also been able to learn from our less glamorous predictions and come up with a currency trading system that has earned us a very respectable success rate on Forex trades.   
Today, we're sharing our Forex trading system with you. We're going to show you how to analyze the movements of any currency pair using a simple checklist of **five key currency-moving factors**. These are the same factors that we use to analyze our own Forex picks.   
  
**Why Forex?**  
Although trading currencies originated as a way to purchase foreign goods and services, investors soon learned that there are **huge speculative returns** to be made by predicting the value of international currencies. Today, those who use the Forex market as an investment vehicle outnumber those who trade currencies to expedite world trade. In fact, as of December 2006, 80% of all trades in the currency market are made by investors or investment entities out to make a **quick return** on their extra cash.   
The Forex market is the **most prolific** market in the world, attracting trillions of dollars per day from central banks, corporations, hedge funds, and individual speculators. This **fast-paced** market operates 24/7, 5 days a week, beginning with trade in Wellington, New Zealand, and continuing on to Sydney, Australia; Tokyo, Japan; London, England; and New York, New York before the whole cycle begins again.   
Forex is exciting, and with the right guidance and a bit of luck you can earn 500%, 600%, even 2000% returns. _But Forex is not for everyone_. If you prefer the penny slots to the high roller tables, then the **high-stakes** world of Forex trading is probably not for you. Forex is best traded with money you have allocated as [risk capital](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskcapital.asp) \-- money you don't need for day to day expenses.   
  
So, if you'd like to spice up your more secure investments with a pinch of adrenalin and a dash of risk, try a few Forex trades. But first, let us show you how you can gain an edge in the market with the...  
**  
Five Keys to Predicting Forex Market Movements**  
To profit from the fascinating world of international trade, you must have a firm grip on the key factors that affect a currency's value. When making our trades, we analyze five key factors. In order of importance, they are:

  1. Interest Rates
  2. Economic Growth
  3. Geo-Politics
  4. Trade and Capital Flows
  5. Merger and Acquisition Activity

If you can predict how each of these factors affect your currency trades, you have the foundation to make **serious returns**.

Five Key Factors that Move the Forex Markets -- and How to Profit from Them  
  

**Key Factor 1. Interest Rates.**  
We use two methods to profit from the difference in countries' interest rates: 

  1. interest income
  2. capital appreciation

_Generating interest income._  
Every currency in the world comes attached with an interest rate that is set by its country’s central bank. All things being equal, you should always **buy currencies from countries with high-interest rates and finance these purchases with currency from countries with low-interest rates.**   
For example, as of the fall of 2006, interest rates in the United States stood at 5.25%, while rates in Japan were set at .25%. You could have taken advantage of this rate difference by borrowing a large sum of Japanese yen, exchanging it for US dollars, and using the US dollars to purchase bonds or CDs at the US 5.25% rate. In other words, you could have borrowed money at .25%, lent it out at 5.25%, and made a 5% return. Or you could save yourself all the hassle of becoming a money lender by simply **trading the currency pair** to affect the same transaction.  
_Generating income from capital appreciation._  
As **a country's interest rate rises, the value of the country's currency also tends to rise** \-- this phenomenon gives you a chance to profit from your currency's increased value, or capital appreciation.   
In the case of the USD/JPY spread in 2005 and 2006, as the US interest rates stayed higher than Japan's, the dollar continued to increase in value. Investors who traded yen for dollars gained from interest income (as explained in the section above) as well as the US dollar's capital appreciation.

Figure 1-1. Between January 2005 and November 2006, as the spread between US and Japanese interest rates widened, so did the spread between the currency values. A wide spread in currency values provides investors with a ripe opportunity to earn income through both interest income and capital appreciation.  

**  
Interest Rates Spark a 700 Point Rally**  
Another great example of the power of interest rates in the currency market occurred in August of 2006. At that time, the Bank of England surprised the market by raising its short-term rates from 4.5% to 4.75%. Interest rates for Japan were still at a low .25%.   
The rise in England's interest rates widened the interest rate differential on the popular GBP/JPY cross from 425 basis points to 450 basis points. Investment money flowed into Great Britain as traders bought up pounds to take advantage of the new spread. As the demand for the GBP increased, the value of the GBP increased, and the spread between the currencies increased. This domino effect lead to a **700-point rally** in the GBP/JPY over the next three weeks.

Figure 1-2. When the Bank of England raised short-term interest rates in August 2006, it lead to a 700-point rally in the GBP/JPY over the next three weeks.

**  
80 Points in Less than 24 Hours**  
More recently, we have used interest rate differentials to successfully predict several profitable trades for _Forex Advisor_ members.   
The concept of interest rates can be used to trade currencies using both long- and short-term perspectives. On a long-term basis, we look for major themes. On a short-term basis, we look for **surprises in the news** that shift the market’s interest rate expectations. We were able to make **two winning trades** based on short-term interest rate flows in the Australian dollar/Japanese yen (AUD/JPY) currency pair on January 24, 2007.   
The trigger for our trade was the surprise drop in Australian consumer prices during the fourth quarter. The market was looking for hot inflation numbers but instead they received cold ones. Low inflation numbers meant the central bank of Australia was not likely to raise interest rates as expected. This news sent the Australian dollar tumbling hard against the Japanese yen, as traders speculated that the **interest rate differential** between the two currencies would no longer grow.   
The first trade we made on January 24 banked us 45 points. We took profit before the currency pair retraced and then sold it again when it showed further signs of weakness. The second January 24 trade produced an additional 35 points for a total of **80 points**.

Australian dollar vs. Japanese yen, January 24, 2007.  By predicting the affect of unexpectedly low inflation on the Australian dollar, we made two winning trades on January 24. Combined, these trades netted us 80 points in one day.

Five Key Factors that Move the Forex Markets -- and How to Profit from Them

  
**Key Factor 2. Economic Growth.**  
The next factor you need to consider when predicting a country's currency movements is its economic growth. The stronger the economy, the greater the possibility that the central bank will raise its interest rates to tame the growth of inflation. And **the higher a country's interest rates, the bigger the likelihood that foreign investors will invest in a country's financial markets.** More foreign investors means a greater demand for the country's currency. A greater demand results in an increase in a currency's value.  
  
Hence, a ripple effect: economic growth inspires higher interest rates inspires more foreign investment inspires greater currency demand which inspires an increase in the currency's value.   
  
**How Anemic Economic Growth Crashed EUR/USD 2,000 Points**  
For a good example of the impact of economic growth on the direction of currency rates, let’s look at the EUR/USD from 2005 to 2006. Economic growth is best measured by a country's Gross Domestic Product, or GDP. The United States and Eurozone represent two of the most prosperous regions in the world with GDPs running at $13 trillion and $11 trillion respectively.   
  
  
In 2005 and 2006, the **difference in growth rates** between the two major economic powers was clearly reflected in currency movements. In 2005, the Eurozone lagged significantly behind the United States in economic growth, averaging an anemic 1.5% rate throughout the year while the US expanded at a healthy 3% rate. Consequently, investment capital flowed **from Europe to the US** and the EUR/USD dropped by nearly 2,000 basis points by the end of 2005. In 2006, however, Eurozone growth perked up while US growth began to slow. At the end of 2006, Eurozone GDP actually overtook US growth rates, causing the EUR/USD to rally.   
  
  
  

[](http://i.investopedia.com/forex/free_report/fig3f.gif)<http://i.investopedia.com/forex/free_report/fig3.gif>

[_Click Here for Larger Image_](http://i.investopedia.com/forex/free_report/fig3f.gif)

In 2005, The EUR/USD plummeted as Eurozone showed little economic growth compared to the US GDP. In 2006, as the EZ GDP rallied, so did the EUR/USD.

  
  
We've used GDP's to forecast trends on several more Forex trades in the past. One great example is our November 14, 2006, United States dollar/ Japanese yen trade (USD/JPY).  
  
**67 Points in Four Hours**   
In the middle of November 2006, hurt by the contraction in its housing sector, the US economic data began to deteriorate. Rumor had it that the US might **lower interest rates** in the first quarter of 2007, which would encourage foreign investors to look elsewhere.   
Meanwhile, the Japanese economy was buoyed by the weak yen that made Japanese products affordable internationally and helped spur double digit growth in exports. On November 14, 2006, the Japanese GDP printed at much better than expected -- 2% versus the 1% forecast. We decided to take advantage of the **strength of the Japanese economic growth** vs. the relatively weak economic outlook in the US, so we went short USD/JPY at 117.82. As we hoped, that morning, in sharp contrast to Japan, US retail sales produced very weak numbers and the USD/JPY pair collapsed. We were able to collect **67 points** on the trade in less than four hours.

Five Key Factors that Move the Forex Markets -- and How to Profit from Them

  
**Key Factor 3. Geo-Politics.**   
Do you hate the business section? Do your eyes glaze over at the mere mention of economic data and mind-numbing accounting numbers? Fear not. The currency market is the only market in the world that can be successfully traded on political news as well as economic releases. Because currencies represent **countries rather than companies** , they are political as well as economic assets and are therefore very responsive to any disturbance in the political landscape.   
The key to understanding speculative behavior with respect to any geopolitical unrest is that speculators run first and ask questions later. In other words, whenever investors fear any threat to their capital, they will quickly retreat to the sidelines until they are certain that the political risk has disappeared. Therefore, the general rule of thumb in the currency market is that **politics almost always trumps economics**. The history of FX is littered with examples of political trades. Let’s take a look at some examples over the past few years.  
  
**No-Confidence Vote Depresses Loonie** The end of May 2005 was not a happy time for the Liberal Party government of Canada’s Prime Minister, Paul Martin. After having guided the country to its best economic performance in 30 years, Martin was facing the fight of his life as his party prepared for a no-confidence vote stemming from accusations of past Liberal Party corruption.   
Meanwhile, Canada’s economy was becoming a star performer, spurred by the massive rises in the price of oil. As the number one exporter of crude to the US, Canada was benefiting mightily from this newfound wealth. Yet despite the great economic news, the Canadian dollar **remained weak** against the greenback as traders worried about the implications of the fall of the Liberals.   
On May 26, 2005, Martin’s government survived the no-confidence vote and the **Canadian dollar rallied** , causing the USD/CAD* to plunge 200 points in less than a week as the market once again focused on Canada’s stellar economic fundamentals.   
*The USD/CAD pair trades inversely.

[_Click Here for Larger Image_](http://i.investopedia.com/forex/free_report/fig4f.gif)

Despite strong economic performance, the Canadian dollar remained weak until Martin survived the no-confidence vote and the Canadian political climate settled.

  
**BoJ Governor Fukui Responsible for Floundering Yen** At the beginning of June 2006, Bank of Japan Governor Fukui revealed to the Diet that he had invested 10 million yen in 1999 in a fund founded by financier Yoshiaki Murakami. Murakami was later indicted on charges of insider trading and although Fukui was not involved in any illegal activity, the mere appearance of impropriety in image-conscious Japan greatly damaged his reputation.   
  
  
As the principal of Japan’s monetary policy during its recovery from a decade-long battle with deflation, Fukui was considered one of the most powerful men in the currency markets. His forced resignation would do **great damage** to the prospects of further recovery in Japan.   
Meanwhile, Japanese economic data continued to show **stellar economic performance** as exports and business investment continued to grow, unemployment reached decade-long lows, and consumer sentiment improved. Talk spread through the markets that Japan would soon abandon its zero-interest rate policy and would actually have positive interest rates for the first time this century.   
Despite all the positive speculation, the **yen floundered** , continuing to decline against the dollar as traders feared that Fukui would have to step down. Fukui stolidly refused, and as the furor passed and the market realized that he would stay on, the yen’s strength returned, showing once again that when it comes to currencies, politics can often be more important than economics.

[_Click Here for Larger Image_](http://i.investopedia.com/forex/free_report/fig5f.gif)

Despite positive speculation and strong economic reports, the Japanese yen did not regain strength until investors realized that Fukui would not resign.

  
  
If you enjoy predicting changes to the political landscape, your talents could be well utilized as a Forex trader. Recently, we predicted a strengthening of the Canadian dollar and earned close to 70 points in less than 24 hours. At 10 to 1 leverage you could have profited along with us, making a **7% return or $700 on a $10,000 trade**.

  
**How OPEC Made Us 70 Points**

Geopolitical risk can mean wars, terrorist attacks, or missile launches, but it can also relate to milder yet still politically powerful events such as G7 meetings and OPEC announcements. In October 2006, Saudi Arabia announced that they would back OPEC’s plans to**cut oil production** by one million barrels a day after oil prices dropped more than 10% in just seven trading days. The cuts were to take effect on November 1, 2006, with more to come in December. 

As Canada is a major exporter and producer of oil, we believed that this policy change would be **very positive** for the Canadian dollar. Therefore we went short the US dollar and long the Canadian on October 19, 2006. Over the next 24 hours, based upon the geopolitical theme, we earned close to **70 points** on the trade.

United States dollar vs. Canadian dollar, October 19, 2006.  Knowing that OPEC's announcement would affect Canadian currency allowed us to gain 70 points on October 19.

Five Key Factors that Move the Forex Markets -- and How to Profit from Them

  
**Key Factor 4. Trade and Capital Flows**  
Before you make your final prediction about the trend of a country's currency, you should take a moment to **categorize the country** as dependent on either trade flow or capital flow. Trade flow refers to how much income a country earns through trade. Capital flow refers to how much investment a country attracts from abroad. Some countries are sensitive to trade flows, while others are far more dependent on capital flows.   
  
Countries whose currency strength depends on their **trade flows** include:

  1. Canada
  2. Australia
  3. New Zealand
  4. Japan
  5. Germany

These countries achieve a large portion of their growth through the export of various commodities. In the case of Canada, oil is the primary source of revenue. For Australia, industrial and precious metals dominate trade, and in New Zealand, agricultural goods are a crucial source of income. Trade flows are also important for other export-dependent countries such as Japan and Germany.   
  
  
For countries such as the US and UK, which have large liquid investment markets, **capital flows** are of far greater importance. In these countries, financial services are paramount. In fact, in the US, financial services represented 40% of the total profits of the S&P 500.   
The United States also serves as a perfect example of why it is crucial to understand which flows affect which country in order to effectively analyze the direction of currencies. On the surface, the US currency, with its record multi-billion dollar trade deficit and near $1 trillion current account deficit should depreciate significantly. However, that has not been the case. As the chart below illustrates, the US has been able to attract more than enough surplus capital from the rest of the world to offset the negative effects of its massive trade deficits.  
  
  

[ ](http://i.investopedia.com/forex/free_report/fig6.gif)<http://i.investopedia.com/forex/free_report/fig6.gif>

[_Click Here for Larger Image_](http://i.investopedia.com/forex/free_report/fig6.gif)

The US has massive trade deficits. However, its currency remains strong because it consistently attracts large amounts of investment capital (capital flow). 

  
  
For the time being, trade-flow deficits do not matter to the dollar. However, should the US become unable to attract enough capital flow to offset its deficits, the currency may weaken.  
Understanding the influence of trade and capital flows has been important to a number of our trades, including our New Zealand dollar/United States dollar (NZD/USD) trade on January 22, 2007.  
  
**Uridashi Bond Prediction Returns 40 Pips**  
New Zealand has one of the highest interest rates in the developed world (as of January 2007 it was 7.25%), and because of that fact, it is a major destination for capital flow. On January 22, 2007, there was talk of **Uridashi bonds** being issued to the benefit of the NZD. Uridashi bonds are issued when companies want to denominate their debt in a higher yielding currency and then offer it to Japanese investors. These are popular because the yield offered is far higher than the yield that Japanese investors can earn at home, which is less than 1%.   
We anticipated that the week’s Uridashi issuances would inspire capital flow into New Zealand as investors purchased the bonds in New Zealand dollars. Once we made this prediction, we had to decide which New Zealand currency pair we would trade to best take advantage of the movement of the New Zealand dollar. We considered both the NZD/USD pair and the NZD/JPY.   
  
  
We decided to go long the New Zealand dollar against the US dollar instead of against the Japanese yen. The risk/reward ratio to go long NZD/JPY versus NZD/USD was not as attractive. Our stop in the NZD/USD was more conservative than the risk we would have assumed in NZD/JPY. Therefore, we went long NZD/USD and banked **40 points over the next 24 hours**.

Five Key Factors that Move the Forex Markets -- and How to Profit from Them

  
**Key Factor 5. Mergers and Acquisitions**  
While merger and acquisition activity is the least important factor in determining the long-term direction of currencies, it can be the most powerful force in staging **near-term currency moves**. Merger and acquisition activity occurs when a company from one economic region wants to make a transnational transaction and buy a corporation from another country.   
If, for example, a European company wants to buy a Canadian asset for $20 billion, it would have to go into the currency market and acquire the currency to affect this transaction. Typically, these deals are not price sensitive, but **time sensitive** because the acquirer may have a date by which the transaction is to be completed. Because of this underlying dynamic, merger and acquisition flow can exert a very strong temporary force on FX trading, sometimes skewing the natural course of currency flow for days or weeks.  
If you keep abreast of international merger and acquisitions, you may be able to predict short-term fluctuations in FX. In late 2006, for example, Canadian economic data showed a great deal of weakness. Yet large demand for Canadian corporate assets from the Asia, Middle East, and Europe overrode the financial reports and kept the USD/CAD at all-time lows*.

Although economic data indicated USD/CAD should rally, the pair stayed at all-time lows due to a large number of foreign investors acquiring Canadian dollars to purchase Canadian equities. 

  
  
In November of 2006, we made a healthy profit by predicting a backward acquisition effect: After a surprising government announcement, money that had been used to purchase equities in Canada, reversed flow and headed out of the country.  
  
**Canada****Loses Investors, Inspires Big Forex Gains**  
Merger and acquisition activity can be a powerful but sometimes stealthy driver of demand in the currency market. When a country’s capital assets such as equities, suddenly find favor from the rest of the world, they indirectly affect pricing in the foreign exchange market as dealmakers first have to **buy the country’s currency** before they can buy the stock. However, woe unto any currency when this situation reverses. Such was the case with USD/CAD in November 2006.   
In the fall of 2006, Stephen Harper's newly elected conservative government made a **shocking announcement** that the very popular Canadian income trusts which enjoyed certain tax advantages would be taxed just like other Canadian securities. The Harper government exacerbated the situation by not grandfathering any of the long-term investors who already held positions in income trusts.   
  
  
  
We thought the impact of this news would be highly negative to the Canadian dollar as foreign capital would quickly **flow out** of the country. Despite lackluster US economic news at the time, we thought a USD/CAD trade would be profitable because news that affects immediate investment flows typically overwhelms any day to day economic data. Therefore, on November 1, 2006 we went long USD/CAD at 1.1290 and were able to bank **45 points** in just a few hours.

**United States dollar vs. Canadian dollar, November, 2006. ** As investment dollars flowed out of Canada, the USD/CAD trade earned us 45 points.  

  
  
At 10 to 1 leverage you could have profited $450 on a $10,000 investment on the November USD/CAD trade -- that's a 4.5% profit in a matter of hours.

Five Key Factors that Move the Forex Markets -- and How to Profit from Them

  
The basic building blocks of Forex analysis are relatively simple to understand. Interest rates, economic growth, politics, trade and capital flows, and merger and acquisition activity are the five primary forces that move prices in the currency market. However, while the factors that drive trade are straightforward, actual currency trading can be **very** **tricky**.   
  
To forecast the Forex market, you must be able to predict the **endless interplay** of each of the five forces affecting a currency pair. A currency pair typically driven by economic growth may suddenly be overtaken by influences in trade flows or short-term acquisitions. A pair that seems sure to fluctuate with interest rates may unexpectedly be held back by investors' response to political unrest.   
Some investors enjoy solving the puzzle themselves -- spending hours and years analyzing the complex cause and effect relationships between a country's economics, politics, and currency strengths. Others are more interested in reaping the potential rewards, without all the hard work. If you are one of the latter, it makes sense for you to find a **qualified Forex analyst** and follow their lead.

Forex: Should You Be Trading Trend Or Range?  ****by Boris Schlossberg** ,   
  
**Whether trading stocks, [futures](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futures.asp), [options](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp) or [FX](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forex.asp), traders confront the single most important question: to [trade trend](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trendtrading.asp) or [range](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rangeboundtrading.asp)? And they answer this question by assessing the price environment; doing so accurately greatly enhances a trader's chance of success. Trend or range are two distinct price properties requiring almost diametrically opposed mindsets and money-management techniques. Fortunately, the FX market is uniquely suited to accommodate both styles, providing trend and range traders with opportunities for profit. Since trend trading is far more popular, let's first examine how trend traders can benefit from FX.  
  
**Trend**   
What is [trend](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trend.asp)? The simplest identifiers of trend direction are higher lows in an uptrend and lower highs in a downtrend. Some define trend as a deviation from a range as indicated by [Bollinger Band](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bollingerbands.asp) "bands" (see _[Using Bollinger Band "Bands" to Trade Trend in FX](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/05/022205.asp)_). For others, a trend occurs when prices are contained by an upward or downward sloping 20-period [simple moving average](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sma.asp) (SMA). **Get In Early**  
Regardless of how one defines it, the goal of trend trading is the same - join the move early and hold the position until the trend reverses. The basic mindset of trend trader is "I am right or I am out?" The implied bet all trend traders make is that price will continue in its present direction. If it doesn't there is little reason to hold onto the trade. Therefore, trend traders typically trade with tight [stops](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stoporder.asp) and often make many probative forays into the market in order to make the right entry.  
  
**Liquidity**  
By nature, trend trading generates far more losing trades than winning trades and requires rigorous risk control. The usual rule of thumb is that trend traders should never risk more than 1.5-2.5% of their [capital](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/05/050505.asp#) on any given trade. On a 10,000-unit (10K) account trading 100K standard [lots](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lot.asp), that means stops as small as 15-25 [pips](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pip.asp) behind the entry price. Clearly, in order to practice such a method, a trader must have confidence that the market traded will be highly [liquid](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp).   
  
Of course the FX market is the most liquid market in the world. With US$1.6 trillion of average daily turnover, the currency market dwarfs the stock and bond markets in size. Furthermore, the FX market trades 24 hours a day five days a week, eliminating much of the [gap risk](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gaprisk.asp) found in exchange-based markets. Certainly gaps sometimes happen in FX, but not nearly as frequently as they occur in stock or bond markets, so [slippage](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/slippage.asp) is far less of a problem.  
  
**High Leverage - Large Profits  
**When trend traders are correct about the trade, the profits can be enormous. This dynamic is especially true in FX where high [leverage](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverage.asp) greatly magnifies the gains. Typical leverage in FX is 100:1, meaning that a trader needs to put down only $1 of [margin](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margin.asp) to control $100 of the currency. Compare that with the stock market where leverage is usually set at 2:1, or even the futures market where even the most liberal leverage does not exceed 20:1.   
  
It's not unusual to see FX trend traders double their [money](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/05/050505.asp#) in a short period if they catch a strong move. Suppose a trader starts out with $10,000 in his or her account, and uses a strict stop-loss rule of 20 pips. The trader may get [stopped out](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stoppedout.asp) five or six times, but if he or she is properly positioned for a large move - like the one in EUR/USD between Sept and Dec 2004 when the pair rose more than 12 cents, or 1,200 pips - that one-lot purchase could generate something like a $12,000 profit, doubling the trader's [account](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/05/050505.asp#) in a matter of months. (For background reading, see _[_The Most Popular Forex Currencies_](http://www.investopedia.com/university/forex-currencies/)_.)  
  
**The Market Always Wins**  
Of course few traders have the discipline to take stop losses continuously. Most traders, dejected by a series of bad trades tend to become stubborn and fight the market, often placing no stops at all. This is when FX leverage can be most dangerous. The same process that quickly produces profits can also generate massive losses. The end result is that many undisciplined traders suffer a [margin call](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margincall.asp) and lose most of their speculative capital.  
  
Trading trend with discipline can be extremely difficult. If the trader uses high leverage he or she leaves very little room to be wrong. Trading with very tight stops can often result in 10 or even 20 consecutive stop outs before the trader can find a trade with strong momentum and directionality.  
  
**Bound to a Range**  
For this reason many traders prefer to trade range-bound strategies. Please note that when I speak of ‘range-bound trading' I am not referring to the classic definition of the word '[range](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/range.asp)'. Trading in such a price environment involves isolating currencies that are trading in [channels](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/channel.asp), and then selling at the top of the channel and buying at the bottom of the channel. This can be a very worthwhile strategy, but, in essence, it is still a trend-based idea - albeit one that anticipates an imminent [countertrend](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/countertrend.asp). (What is a countertrend after all, except a trend going the other way?)  
**  
Range**   
True range traders don't care about direction. The underlying assumption of range trading is that no matter which way the currency travels, it will most likely return back to its point of origin. In fact, range traders bet on the possibility that prices will trade through the same levels many times, and the traders' goal is to harvest those oscillations for profit over and over again.  
  
Clearly range trading requires a completely different money-management technique. Instead of looking for just the right entry, range traders prefer to be wrong at the outset so that they can build a trading position.  
  
**Putting it into Practice**  
For example, imagine that EUR/USD is trading at 1.3000. A range trader may decide to short the pair at that price and every 50 pips higher, and then buy it back as it moves every 25 pips down. His or her assumption is that eventually the pair will return to that 1.3000 level again. If EUR/USD rises to 1.3500 and then turns back down hitting 1.3000, the range trader would harvest a handsome profit, especially if the currency moves back and forth in its climb to 1.3500 and its fall to 1.3000.  
  
However, as we can see from this example a range-bound trader will need to have very deep pockets in order to implement this strategy. In this case employing large leverage can be devastating since positions can often go against the trader for many [points](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/points.asp) in a row and, if he or she is not careful, trigger a [margin call](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margincall.asp) before the currency eventually turns around.   
  
**Solutions for Range Traders**   
Fortunately, the FX market provides a flexible solution for range trading. Most retail FX dealers offer mini lots of 10,000 units rather than 100K lots. In a 10K lot each individual pip is worth only $1 instead of $10, so the same hypothetical trader with a $10,000 account can have a stop-loss [budget](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/05/050505.asp#) of 200 pips instead of only 20 pips. Even better, many dealers allow customers to trade in units of 1K or even 100-unit increments. Under that scenario, our range trader trading 1K units could withstand a 2,000-pip [drawdown](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/drawdown.asp) (with each pip now worth only 10 cents) before triggering a stop loss. This flexibility allows range traders plenty of room to run their strategies.   
  
In FX, almost no dealer charges commission. Customers simply pay the [bid-ask spread](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bid-askspread.asp). Furthermore, regardless of whether a customer wants to deal for 100 units or 100,000 units, most dealers will quote the same price. Therefore, unlike the stock or futures markets where retail customers often have to pay prohibitive commissions on very small size trades, retail speculators in FX suffer no such disadvantage. In fact a range-trading strategy can be implanted on even a small account of $1,000, as long as the trader properly sizes his or her trades.  
**  
Bottom Line  
**Whether a trader wants to swing for homeruns by trying to catch strong trends with very large leverage or simply hit singles and bunts by trading a range strategy with very small lot sizes, the FX market is extraordinarily well suited for both approaches. As long as the trader remains disciplined about the inevitable losses and understands the different money-management schemes involved in each strategy, he or she will have a good chance of success in this market.

Five Key Factors that Move the Forex Markets -- and How to Profit from Them

  
  
  
We decided to go long the New Zealand dollar against the US dollar instead of against the Japanese yen. The risk/reward ratio to go long NZD/JPY versus NZD/USD was not as attractive. Our stop in the NZD/USD was more conservative than the risk we would have assumed in NZD/JPY. Therefore, we went long NZD/USD and banked **40 points over the next 24 hours**.   
  
  
Hi Forexcube,  
As usual your postings are very interesting.   
Do you mind to talk more about risk reward ratios?, Where can you find risk reward ratios (in numbers) on a specific currency and/or pair? Is risk/reward ration same as risk aversion/apetite? Risk sentiment?  
Thank you,  
Bcarbon

Hi Bcarbon  
  
Nice to hear from you. It's a pleasure for me to point it out in detail in the following days, ... to be headlined "Risk/Reward Ratio".  
At first I will copy some definition, may be monday or tuesday, any more I will qualify some aspects the pros and cons and in addition I will explain how traders can assign the R-R-R factor to CCI(14) Tops & Bottom Trading which was one of my principle reasons why Time Cell Trading was full-fledged. I hope that this procedure will receive your endorsement.  
  
Kindest regards  
FXcube

**The Risk-Reward Ratio**  
  
By [John Russell](http://forextrading.about.com/bio/John-Russell-44005.htm), About.com Guide  
  
**See More About****:**  

  1. [risk management](http://forextrading.about.com/lr/risk_management/335886/1/)
  2. [advanced trading](http://forextrading.about.com/lr/advanced_trading/335886/2/)

  
****Know your Risk: The Risk-Reward Ratio****  
  
Risk is a part of trading. Every trade carries a certain level of risk. Every trader must know the amount of risk that is being assumed on each trade. Knowing the amount of risk on each trade is one way to limit it and to protect your trading account. The best way to know your risk is to determine the risk-reward ratio. It is one of the most effective risk management tools used in trading.  
The risk-reward ratio is a parameter that helps a trader to determine the level of risk in a trade. It shows how much a trader is risking versus the potential reward (or profit) on a trade. While this may seem simplistic, many traders neglect taking this step and often find that their losses are very large.   
****How to Determine the Risk-Reward Ratio?****  
  
The first step is to determine the amount of risk. This can be determined by the amount of money needed to enter the trade. The cost of the currency multiplied times the number of lots will help the trader to know how much money is actually at risk in the trade. The first number in the ratio is the amount of risk in the trade.   
The reward is the gain in the currency price that the trader is hoping to earn from the currency price movement. This gain multiplied times the number of lots traded is the potential reward. The second number in the ratio is the potential reward (or profit) of the trade.  
  
**Examples**  
Here are a few examples of the risk-reward ratio:

  1. If the risk is $200 and the reward is $400, then the risk-reward ratio is 200:400 or 1:2.
  2. If the risk is $500 and the reward it $1,500, then the risk-reward ratio is 500:1500 or 1:3.
  3. If the risk is $1,000 and the reward is $500, then the risk-reward ratio is 1000:500 or 2:1.

****What is a Good Risk-Reward Ratio?****  
  
The minimum risk-reward ratio for a Forex trade is 1:2. However, a larger ratio is better. An acceptable risk-reward ratio for beginning traders is 1:3. Any number below 1:3 is too risky so the trade should be avoided. Never enter a trade in which the risk-reward ratio is 1:1 or the risk outweighs the reward.   
Many experienced trader will only enter trades in which the risk-reward ratio is 1:5 or higher. This requires that the trader wait for a trade with this ratio, but the reward is worth it. A higher risk-reward ratio is a good idea in case the currency does not make the anticipated price movement. However, if the trader uses a lower risk-reward ratio, there is very little room for smaller price movements and the amount of risk will increase.   
The risk-reward ratio is an important risk management and trading tool. It is important for beginning traders to take the extra time to perform this task because it can help to minimize risk in every trade. Waiting for the right risk-reward ratio can take a long time. However, the benefits of waiting for a higher risk-reward ratio are worth the effort and patience. You will know your risk and know your potential profit. Most importantly, you will know whether the trade is worthy of your money.

What Does _Risk/Reward Ratio_ Mean?**

This ratio is calculated mathematically by dividing the amount of profit the trader expects to have made when the position is closed (i.e. the reward) by the amount he or she stands to lose if price moves in the unexpected direction (i.e. the risk).

**  
Investopedia explains _Risk/Reward Ratio_**  
Let's say a trader purchases 100 shares of XYZ Company at $20 and places a stop-loss order at $15 to ensure that her losses will not exceed $500. Let's also assume that this trader believes that the price of XYZ will reach $30 in the next few months. In this case, the trader is willing to risk $5 per share to make an expected return of $10 per share after closing her position. Since the trader stands to make double the amount that she has risked, she would be said to have a 2:1 risk/reward ratio on that particular trade. The optimal risk/reward ratio differs widely among trading strategies. Some trial and error is usually required to determine which ratio is best for a given trading strategy.

**Reward-to-Risk Ratio**  
  
[http://www.babypips.com/school/image...or/falling.png](http://www.babypips.com/school/images/junior/falling.png)   
  
Another way you can increase your chances of profitability is to trade when you have the potential to make 3 times more than you are risking. If you give yourself a 3:1 reward-to-risk ratio, you have a significantly greater chance of ending up profitable in the long run. Take a look at this chart as an example:  
  
  
10 Trades Loss Win **1** $1,000 **2** $3,000 **3** $1,000 **4** $3,000 **5** $1,000 **6** $3,000 **7** $1,000 **8** $3,000 **9** $1,000 **10** $3,000 **Total** $5,000 $15,000   
  
In this example, you can see that even if you only won 50% of your trades, you would still make a profit of $10,000. Just remember that whenever you trade with a good risk to reward ratio, your chances of being profitable are much greater even if you have a lower win percentage.  
  
  
**BUT...  
** And this is a big one, like Jennifer Lopez's behind... setting large reward-to-risk ratio comes at a price. On the very surface, the concept of putting a high reward-to-risk ratio sounds good, but think about how it applies in actual trade scenarios.  
Let's say you are a scalper and you only wish to risk 3 pips. Using a 3:1 reward to risk ratio, this means you need to get 9 pips. Right off the bat, the odds are against you because you have to pay the spread.   

[http://ads.babypips.com/newads/www/d...&cb=59275ff7df](http://ads.babypips.com/newads/www/delivery/lg.php?bannerid=338&campaignid=84&zoneid=11&loc=1&referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.babypips.com%2Fschool%2Freward-to-risk-ratio.html&cb=59275ff7df)  

  
If your broker offered a 2 pip spread on EUR/USD, you'll have to gain 11 pips instead, forcing you to take a difficult 4:1 reward to risk ratio. Considering the exchange rate of EUR/USD could move 3 pips up and down within a few seconds, you would be stopped out faster than you can say "Uncle!" If you were to reduce your position size, then you could widen your stop to maintain your desired reward/risk ratio. Now, if you increased the pips you wanted to risk to 50, you would need to gain 153 pips. By doing this, you are able to bring your reward-to-risk ratio somewhere nearer to your desired 3:1. Not so bad anymore, right?   
In the real world, reward-to-risk ratios aren't set in stone. They must be adjusted depending on the time frame, market environment, and your entry/exit points. A position trade could have a reward-to-risk ratio as high as 10:1 while a scalper could go for as little as 0.7:1.

****Risk/Reward Ratio in Forex - What Is the Proper Risk and Reward Ratio in Forex Trading?****  
  
By Vahid | Category: [Forex Basics](http://www.forexoma.com/category/basics/) | Monday, September 28th, 2009   
  
It is very easy to find hundreds of articles about risk/reward ratio in forex trading, but the problem is that **most of** those articles are not written by real traders who trade for a living or have been working as professional traders for a while. Most of them are written by freelance writers who are paid to write articles or bloggers and webmasters who want to drive some traffic to their weblogs and websites. Most of these writers have never placed any order on the market throughout their lives. The bigger problem is that novice traders believe each and every word of these articles, just because they are published on the internet, but they don’t know that the directions that these articles give are not applicable in live trading. After reading these articles, novice traders try to apply them in their trades and after such a long time of trial and error, they will think that they are not able to follow the trading rules and so they give up, whereas it is the information and directions of the articles that can not be applied in live trading.  
  
  
For example, on most of the articles you read about risk/reward ratio, it is strongly recommended that novice traders should not even think about taking positions with a risk/ratio of as high as 1:1 or even 1:2 (I will explain what these numbers mean later in this article) and the maximum risk/reward ratio of the positions that new traders take should be 1:3. There is nothing wrong with it so far, but the problem is that these articles never clarify if traders should have a low risk/reward ratio through having wide targets OR tight stop losses. As nobody likes to lose, specially new traders, they all think that they should make their stop loss as tight as possible to have a low risk/reward ratio trade, whereas this is a big mistake. No matter how tight or wide the targets are, a trader can not fool around with the stop loss. Choosing the stop loss has its own rules that can not be ignored or broken. If you set your stop loss tighter than what it has to be, you will be stopped out easily even when your position is correct.  
  
  
Something that looks even stranger in these articles is that they emphasize that “novice” traders should not take positions with 1:1 or 1:2 risk/reward ratios. Does it mean that experienced traders can do it? Are there different trading rules and techniques for novice and experienced traders? Maximizing the profit and having 1:3 or 1:5 trades can be done by professional and experienced traders, but there are some technical and emotional difficulties in front of novice traders to do that. For example, to achieve a successful 1:5 trade, you may have several losing trades (I will tell you why). This is not a problem for professional traders at all, but for a novice trader who is learning the techniques and has to build his/her confidence at the same time, having losing trades can cause lack of confidence and excessive fear that prevent him/her from advancing to the next steps.  
So we can not believe and apply whatever we read over the internet. There are zillions of systems, techniques, indicators, robots and… that are absolutely useless when it comes to live and real trading.  
  
  
After the above introduction, lets see what risk/reward ratio is and why it is important in forex trading. Risk is the amount of the money that you may lose in a trade. If you have already read the [ money management](http://www.forexoma.com/money-management-in-forex-trading-how-to-manage-your-money-in-forex/) article, you know that we should not risk more than 2-3% of our capital in each trade. It means when we find a trade setup and we find a proper place for [the stop loss](http://www.forexoma.com/where-is-the-best-place-for-stop-loss-and-limit-orders/), we have to choose our position lot size in the way that if the market hits our stop loss, we lose maximum 2-3% of our capital. For example we have found a trade setup with EUR-USD that has to have an 80 pips stop loss. We have a $5000 account. If EUR-USD hits our stop loss, we should lose $150 which is 3% of our capital (0.03 x $5000 = $150). It means 80 pips equals $150 (you can use the position size calculator I have on the money management article). This $150 is our risk. But what is the reward? Reward is the profit that we can make in a trade. In the above example, if we choose a 160 pips target for our trade and EUR-USD hits this target, we will make $300 (when 80 pips equals $150, so 160 pips equals $300). This $300 profit is the reward.  
  
  
So what is the risk/reward ratio of this trade? 150:300 = **1:2**  
The larger the profit (target) against the loss (stop loss), the smaller the risk/reward ratio which means your risk is smaller than your reward. For example if your stop loss is 20 pips in a trade and your target is 100 pips, your risk/reward ratio will be 1:5 in this trade.  
  
  
**What is the recommended risk/reward ratio in forex trading?**  
1:3 or 1:5 risk/reward ratio is achievable when the market forms a trend and you succeed to enter on time. In most cases you should be able to hit the top and bottom of the trends, no matter on what time frame you trade. Or if you enter at the middle of the way, the trend should be strong enough to give you another big movement and make a profit which is 3 or 5 times bigger than your stop loss. You can do that. Why not? But there are just a few problems: 1. Markets form a trend in less than 30% of the cases; 2. Some trends are not strong enough that if you enter with delay and while they are at the middle of the way, they can hit your target which is 3 or 5 times bigger than your stop loss. 3. There are many cases that you miss the trends; you hesitate to enter and so you miss the chance; you think you have found a trend whereas you are wrong and it returns and hits your stop loss and… . So you lose in many trades, because you want to catch a big one.  
  
  
So in reality, you have to lose in many trades, or have many of your trades closed at breakeven by the stop loss (because you will have to move the stop loss to breakeven when you are in a special amount of profit), or not to trade for such a long time waiting for a strong trend, until you can have a 1:3 or 1:5 trade.  
  
  
How is it possible to catch a 1:3 or 1:5 trade without losing so many other trades?  
  
  
If you take a position with 1:3 or 1:5 stop loss to target ratio and then you wait for it to hit your stop loss or target, you will have so many losing trades before having a winning trade. The reasons are mentioned above.  
  
  
**The solution is in moving the stop loss.** You should not let your stop loss remain at its initial position. To have a 1:3 trade, the distance of your entry and your final target should be splitted into 3 parts (at least), while each part is equal to your original stop loss value. For example if you have a 50 pips stop loss, you should have a final target for 150 pips which should be splitted into three 50 pips levels. Then you should move your stop loss in three stages (in this example I assume that you take a 3% risk in each trade):  
1\. If the price reaches to the first 1/3 level, you should move the stop loss to breakeven. At this stage, if the price goes against you and hits the stop loss, you will get out without any profit/loss, BUT you should consider that you had an initial risk of 3%.  
2\. If it reaches the 2/3 level, you should move the stop loss to 1/3 level. At this stage, if the price goes against you and hits the stop loss, you will get out with a profit which equals your initial risk. For example if your stop loss has been 3% of your account, you will get out with a 3% profit. Therefore, such a trade will be ended as a 1:1 risk/reward trade.  
3\. If it becomes so close to the final target, you should move the stop loss to 2/3 level. Then you have to wait until it hits the final target or returns and hits the stop loss. At this stage, if it goes against you and hits the stop loss, you will get out with a profit which is twice of your initial risk. For example if your stop loss is 3% of your account, you will get out with a 6% profit. Therefore, such a trade will be ended as a 1:2 risk/reward trade. If the price hits the final target, your trade will be closed with a 9% profit and so you will have a 1:3 risk/reward trade.  
  
  
So, to have a 1:3 trade, you will have some -3% trades which are those trades that hit the stop loss at its initial position. You will also have some 0% trades that are those trades that hit the stop loss at breakeven. Some of your trades will be +3% trades which are those that hit the stop loss at 1/3 level. Some will be +6% trades which are those that hit the stop loss at 2/3 level. And finally, some trades will be +9% trades which are those that trigger the final target.  
  
  
**Now the question is what percent of your trades will be -3%, 0%, +3%, +6% and 9% trades?**  
It is impossible to answer the above question, because it depends on many things including the trading strategy and market condition. However, there is something that gives us a clue about the number of our 1:3 and 1:5 trades. It is the fact that says market trends only in 30% of the cases and it makes ranging, 70% of the time. To have 1:3 and 1:5 trades, we should have a strong trend, otherwise our stop loss will be triggered in one of the stages before reaching the final target, no matter what time frame you use to take your position.  
  
  
No need to remind again that in any of the -3%, 0%, +3%, +6% and 9% trades your risk is the same which is 3%. The first conclusion is that taking the risk and the position is up to you, BUT it is the market that determines how your trade should be ended. This is something that all traders, specially novice ones should consider. When you read in different websites and web pages that your trades should only be 1:3 and 1:5 trades, you should consider that you really never know how many of your trades will be ended as 1:3 and 1:5 trades.  
  
  
That was about risk/reward ratio in general. Now lets become more specific and talk about [Forexoma trading signals](http://www.forexoma.com/), their risk/reward ratios and if it is possible to have 1:3 or 1:5 trades with Forexoma signals or not.  
  
  
The stop loss of the positions that I take are chosen based on the technical analysis rules that I have for myself. I will never break any of these rules. Some traders think that my stop losses are too wide, but they are not. Unlike some other traders who have a constant value for their stop loss (for example any position they take, with any currency pair and any time frame, has a 120 pips stop loss), I mainly follow the rule of thumb we have for setting the stop loss. The rule says that you should place your stop loss in a position that becomes triggered only when the direction you choose is completely wrong. So when I want to set the stop loss, I ask myself under what condition the position I have taken is wrong. The answer I give to this question is the position of the stop loss. In one of the articles I published long time ago, I have explained about [ setting the stop loss and target orders](http://www.forexoma.com/where-is-the-best-place-for-stop-loss-and-limit-orders/).  
  
  
So my stop losses can not be tighter. What about the targets? Can they be wider?  
  
  
In the way that I choose the entries, most of our trades can have bigger targets and having 1:2 and 1:3 trades is possible with most of the positions we take, because our entry point is always well-chosen. Of course it can be different in different days, weeks and months. I will tell you how to trade my signals in the way that you can have 1:3 trades.  
  
  
Now the question is if my signals can be used to have 1:3 and even 1:5 positions, why my targets are smaller than what they can be?  
As you know in the typical signals that I send the members, usually there are two targets. The first target is usually half of the stop loss size and the second target is the same size as the stop loss. Traders can close 50% of their positions at the first target and then move the stop loss to breakeven. Then they can close the second 50% at the second target. There is a second way too. They can just move the stop loss to breakeven when the price reaches the first target and then close the whole position at the second target. In the [last performance report](http://www.forexoma.com/forexomas-august-2009-performance-report/) I have published, I have explained 4 different ways that members can trade the signals I send them.  
To answer the above question that why my targets are small, I have to say that they are small because there are different traders with different levels of skill among the members. Advanced traders know how to maximize their positions. They just use my signals to enter. However there are many other members who like to take as many positions as they can and they like to see them finished all green and positive. As I said above, they are building their confidence while they are learning the techniques. They need to see the positive result of the things they are learning. They are not disciplined and patient enough yet to maximize their trades and it is so painful to them, if a position which is in a good profit, suddenly goes against them and hits the stop loss at breakeven and they get out without any profit. The tight targets I have in the signals I send the members, are for these members. Unlike the others who believe novice traders should start with 1:3 and 1:5 trades, I believe they should start with 1:1 and even bigger risk/reward ratios to build their confidence. When they become more skilled, which can take them a few years at least, they can maximize their profits and have 1:3 and 1:5 positions. I am 100% sure that those who say novice traders should only take 1:3 and 1:5 positions, are not real traders and know nothing about live and even demo trading. Unfortunately there are zillions of them these days who develop forex websites, weblogs and even robots and e-books. Forex is just a market for them to make money, not through forex trading, but through selling useless forex related products to “novice” traders. [http://www.forexoma.com/wp-includes/.../icon_wink.gif](http://www.forexoma.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif)  
  
  
Anyway!  
From now on, each signal comes with two sets of targets. In the first set, the targets will be the same as they were used to be in the signals I sent. In the second set, the targets will be for a 1:3 risk/reward trade. The stop loss will be the same in both sets, because as I said I can not make the stop losses tighter. It is up to the members to choose the way they like to trade. We will have enough instructions in members area to help members to take their positions with any level of risk/reward ratio they like.  
  
Should you have any question or suggestion, please use the below comment form.

**Why the Risk-to-Reward Ratio is Overrated**  
  
By [Walter Peters](http://www.tradingmarkets.com/authors/all/Walter_Peters) | **TradingMarkets.com** | May 26, 2010 08:31 AM   
  
  
Sometimes axioms are repeated over and over, and that is enough for many to accept them as fact. "No pain, no gain" - really? Would every doctor agree with that? "If it sounds too good to be true, then it probably is" - well, truthfully there are homes selling for $1 now, so maybe that isn't true either.  
  
In trading, one of my favorites is "you must aim to get more profit than you risk on each trade." Sometimes this is stated in other ways, such as:  
  
"Always keep your reward to risk ratio greater than 1"  
"Only take trades with a minimum of a 2:1 reward to risk ratio"  
"If you aim for more than you risk, then you will [make money](http://www.tradingmarkets.com/.site/forex/how_to/articles/Why-the-Risk-to-Reward-Ratio-is-Overrated-80805.cfm#)."  
"A good reward to risk ratio ensures you to be profitable, winning more than you lose."  
  
Another way of stating this is that your reward to risk ratio must be greater than 1, or 2, or any other number that your favorite trading guru comes up with. Many traders have heard that it is desirable to have a high reward to risk ratio, and it certainly makes it easier for a trader to make money even if the trader has a low win percentage. However, there are many profitable traders who always risk more than they aim to secure in profits. The key to profitability for these traders is that they keep a high win rate.  
  
An example may best illustrate how the reward to risk ratio is calculated:  
  
Trader Amber decides to buy the EUR/USD at 1.3100  
Amber puts her stop loss at 1.3050, so her stop is 50 pips away from her entry.  
Amber decides to enter a profit target of 1.3200, 100 pips away from her entry.  
Thus, Amber is risking 50 pips to make 100 pips.  
If we divide the possible gain by the possible loss, we get the reward to risk ratio.  
100 pips profit / 50 pips risked = 2:1 reward to risk ratio  
  
In other words, Amber has decided to keep her profit target further from her entry price than her stop loss. This certainly is understandable, but there are many other [ways to make money ](http://www.tradingmarkets.com/.site/forex/how_to/articles/Why-the-Risk-to-Reward-Ratio-is-Overrated-80805.cfm#)trading.   
  
Keeping a good reward to risk ratio may increase your average win size and decrease your average loss size, but there are other statistics that determine your overall profitability, as a trader.  
  
The most important statistics are as follows:  
  
Percentage of winning trades - W%.   
Percentage of losing trades - L%.  
Average gain on a winning trade - Ave W.  
Average loss of a losing trade - Ave L.  
  
Here's why these statistics are important - with just these four statistics you can find out how good your trading system is, and thus decide if it is worth it to trade the system with real money. With these four statistics you can calculate expectancy of your [trading system](http://www.tradingmarkets.com/.site/forex/how_to/articles/Why-the-Risk-to-Reward-Ratio-is-Overrated-80805.cfm#).  
  
The formula is as follows:  
  
Expectancy = (W% x Ave W) - (L% x Ave L)  
  
The expectancy number tells you how much money you would expect to win over many trades. The best way to get these statistics is to backtest your trading strategy, or employ your [trading strategy](http://www.tradingmarkets.com/.site/forex/how_to/articles/Why-the-Risk-to-Reward-Ratio-is-Overrated-80805.cfm#) with a demo account. Do this for many, many trades (at least 50), and then plug in the numbers.  
  
Let's look at a trader, Jeff, as an example:  
Let's say that trader Jeff has a trading system that he backtests manually in a demo account for six months, with over 900 trades, and he gets the following statistics.  
  
W% - 70%  
  
L% - 30%  
  
Ave W - $200  
  
Ave L - $420  
  
Calculating expectancy, Jeff sees that (0.7 x 200) - (0.3 x 420) = $140 - $126 = $14.   
  
So, armed with this information, trader Jeff knows that if he takes 100 trades with his system, and the average winning trade is $200, and the average losing trade is $420, with a 70% win rate he is likely to have 70 winning trades, 30 losing trades and he will probably make $1400.   
  
How does Jeff know this? He knows this because he knows that (70 x $200) - (30 x $420) = $14,000 - $12,600 = $1,400.  
  
This doesn't mean trader Jeff will make $1,400. This only means that we would expect him to make $1,400 over 100 trades. Of course Jeff's real results could be a little better or a little worse, but they are probably going to be very near $1,400 after 100 trades.  
Many traders, including myself, have gotten into trouble by simply focusing on one part of the equation.  
Traders who focus on win rate and forget about average loss size can get into trouble if their average loss gets too big.   
  
This is the sort of problem that many scalpers run into. Scalpers count on a high win rate. Without a high win rate most scalpers will lose   
[money](http://www.tradingmarkets.com/.site/forex/how_to/articles/Why-the-Risk-to-Reward-Ratio-is-Overrated-80805.cfm#). This is because nearly every scalper, by definition, will look to take quick profits from the markets, however the scalper will often have a stop loss that is placed further away than the profit target, and this can spell trouble if the win percentage starts to slip. Some scalpers avoid this problem by letting some positions run for a while if they are exceptionally well-timed entries. This will dramatically increase the scalper's average win and can really improve the odds of the scalper's long term survival.   
Traders who focus on average win size can get into trouble if they let their win rate get too low.   
This problem is common with those traders who are focused on the reward to risk ratio. Sometimes traders become "slave to the reward to risk ratio." Profit targets should be placed where the market is likely to go. Traders who focus too much on the reward to risk ratio can avoid this problem by defining profit targets using sound market analysis, and THEN calculating the reward to risk ratio.  
There are many things to think about when backtesting your trading system - the reward to risk ratio will tell only part of the story. If you have a trading system that you think may work, backtest the strategy, and then calculate the expectancy. You may find that that the strategy makes money, even if the reward to risk ratio is not ideal.

EURUSD, Daily, 2010 November 29  
  
Looks like "to win the mare or loose the halter".  
  
The whole trick seems for me to wait now. So stay at the sideline and wait.   
  
May be some M1/M5 trades but not at H4 and Daily longer investments till things are getting clearer.

May be you could reinterpret a downward channel e.g. 1.4120 - 1.1684 since 2008.07.01 if big capital will resolve upon to trade against the Euro.

EURNZD, Daily, 2010 November 29  
  
Daily  
Have put the EURNZD at my Watchlist and wait for a price action (engulfing pattern, or a hammer, or an in bar, or something like that) in combination with a CCI(14) bottom, before I could go in the market with some long investments.  
  
There're a lot of indifferent candles around the important support line in the last two weeks.  
  
Monthly  
Monthly bar could go further down November, may be December Bar too, before a trend revearsal could come up. I don't know - may be as we shall see later.  
  
Good trading at H1/H4 by waiting for the next breakout before trades at higher timeframes could be done.

to stick to the top attachement,  
we see a clear squeeze of the bollinger bands toward the middle one,  
  
en conclusio : a very (big timeframe = big move) big move is coming, i prefer the upside cause as FXcube already said there isn't much space for PA downwards, lot of support here,  
  
lets see....  
  
time round christmas will be smooth also....

EURJPY, Daily, 2010 November 29  
  
  
Really funny.  
EURJPY Daily seems to work out a pattern recognition where you have to count "one", "two" and at "two" you put out your order.  
May be it could be better trading the Daily CCI(14) Tops and Bottoms Divergences.

I have been taking part in a trading contest run by a broker, its good for practice and there is a first prize of $5000, so it is worth taking part as normally people with demo accounts don't bother with money management or rules, they will leave trades open, not close losers etc.  
  
Now you might wonder what this has to do with fxcube. Well trading with fear of no loss makes you a much better trader, even though you are taking part in a contest and you want to win, you don't care if a trade runs against you, provided you expected it. If I was trading for real money I would get edgy and want to close taking a loss.  
  
Its the same with this system, losses occur when you close a trade, the variation between your entry and the market can be large, maybe 70 pips or so. Most traders use 20 pip stops and get chopped up.  
  
In trading understanding the pair you trade is a requirement, types of moves, when does it start to move are all prime requirements if you really are a serious trader.  
  
My advice to anyone is to trade in the bigger trend direction and use fxcubes system it looks great. To be honest I gave up using indicators a while back, my one real rule now is if the markets moving down sell it, if its moving up buy it.  
  
I think this is a well thought out strategy, maybe one eye on the bigger trend would help turn it into a fantastic strategy.  
  
All the best

Everybody needs to trade his own style and his own system, u can copy systems out of ff.com and otherwise but actually u should adapt it to ur liking.  
In FXcubes sys there are a lot of false signals as well.... there is no perfect Indicator or System.

Hi Mike Haran  
  
If you mean the Contes by Alpari from November 05 - December 05 so I know it and also I take part there. There is a leverage only from 1:10, not more and that was interesting me. My target was 5-20% in a month. May account is now at 119'363.01 so there is a Profit: 19'363.01 ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1) since 2010 November 5 - not bad for an account with a leverag from 1:10. Below you can see the "contest orders".  
  
I wish you success and Happiness!

Hi PhAnTi'  
  
Time Cell Trading don't evoked more false signals than other trading systems here at FF-Board. You have to read Time Cell Trading System in a right way - so work out the Multiple Time Frame Analysis before you will choose the right time frame. I have given a lot of examples here on board how to do it and others will follow. What do you mean, when you talk about "a lot of false signals", please give a collection of examples here on board, then we can discuss all it here. I hate the generalizations like "a lot of". It pisses me off though! TCT is one of my 20 self-developed trading systems and I think TCT avoid many pitfalls!   
  
Modes request:...and the rest is inherent in the system, so every system have it. What an information value has now your declaration in practice.  
  
Show examples, please! Then we can discuss in detail and improving the performance.   
  
Kindest regards  
Fxcube

Hi Mike Haran  
  
short clarification  
  
It's not fear or anxiety ..it's my sheer kind of trading for the simple reason that I will take up the baton for a time before the Stop Loss will throw out these orders out of the market, ....and can hedge these positions several time, before the most of them will run in a win. It's a kind of calculus, not a question of fear.  
  
Hope you understand these conditions now better.  
  
Kindest regards  
Fxcube

there isn't a system without any false signals

Look at p.1, #[**1**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3928224&postcount=1), Variety of Topis - False Signals: How to read false signals in a right way? USDCHF/Daily, p.18, #[**260**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3960917&postcount=260);, EURUSD/H4, p.21, #[**309**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3968732&postcount=309).  
  
Oh yes, but these are only stupid generalization. You read this sh*t everywhere and time and again. You are a clever man. Come on! Bring up a real subject.

I too am in the contest, at the moment I am sitting with a good profit in the top 30, all I am doing is selling the trend. Like you I was always working with strategys and looking for a winning system.   
  
I failed as a trader because I was trying to make someones system my own and that never works. We are all individual people, we think and act in different ways, I hate position trading because I can't stand the market comming back on a position, thats me so long term trading is out really as my head hates it. I would rather trade, take a profit, get in on a retrace again. Possibly not the best way to trade, maybe the best is enter a position and leave it alone adding as the market goes in your direction. That is the best way I know it. But I can't do it because I a not wired that way.  
  
I love your system, I think it is intelligent and well thought out, there are not 100% winning systems 99% for sure if you want to have 1 trade wipe out 400, again its like building a house and having one day tear it down. Not for me but some people will be able to do it. At the moment I like to trade on a 78% winning to losing trade ratio, because I feel that I get rewarded when I am right. I close my trades when the market looks like it does not want to go lower, thats practice. Trading a empty chart is something I find very relaxing. Its you and price and nothing else.  
  
Best of luck

AUDCAD, Monthly, 2010 November 30  
  
CCI(14) at the Top. As a Long Line Trade seems to be a good argument for some enter short. May be wait at confirmation with Daily and H4 (both CCIs are now down and not at its tops, see #[**994**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4207487&postcount=994), please). I take the risk just now with some positions and added some others enter short by a higher market price .  
  
Weekly (no chart here) could go further down till the middle line of BB, may be then a retrace before crossing it further downwards. We don't know! Let's see.

AUDCAD, H4, 2010 November 30  
  
H4 is showing a divergence. Could be that the market price go now a little up before the main downtrend will go further on.

Hi mrhb30jr  
  
The Euro could even so make a down till ~ 1.1650 if big captial could select the Euro for pure speculation (see #[**978**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4205183&postcount=978) , please). Euro can go up and down and up and down, so it has reached an uncontrolled status up to date, where erratic movements could breakout anytime and fast and this could join in some misinterpretation. My be take some trades at M1/M5/M15. May be we could see a strong move over 1'000 pips at one day, if speculation power will come to more force.   
  
My two cents (worth),...the Euro isn't 0.9 worth, so do the Dollar.  
  
You're wellcome!  
  
Kindest regards

Trading an empty chart,...it's for me a kind of meditation without any stress!  
  
The drop is the order and the waves the impact of the market,...all or part of.  
  
To come to rest!

Hi Ducke  
  
The profit isn't the point which I would highlight. You can make profit with high lot sizes like the example #[**998**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4209228&postcount=998). Important consideration might be an infinite deal more: Does continual wins perform steadily in again? I think. Yes! It's only TCT with MTFA how it is explain at this thread.  
  
Kindest regards

Monthly shows down and weekly chart even so, by contrast H4 and Daily shows a divergence for an upward movement.  
  
M1-Trading shouldn't work daylong! M1-Indicators don't have enough power.  
  
Be careful!

I like more to stay at the sideline with the trading at the higher timeframes dead on time. So I trade predominantly more shorter timeframes. This seems for me an important statement, due to the fact that there will be at all trading systems market conditions where the trading system seems to be a little out of order. If you trade the Time Cell Trading (TCT) with Multiple Time Frame Analysis (MTFA) and the conlusion is comprised of say "a few pro arguments" and "a few contra arguments" then it might be better to wait for serene weather and wait at the sideline with your open umbrella.

Wait...for better market entries and shorten the time may be with hearing of  
  
_Wait, Wait, Wait (Just Song)_  
  

Inserted Video

  
  
  
**Wait, Wait, Wait Lyrics**  
Artist(Band):**The Format  
  
**the chords we play,  
ways left to communicate  
these roads are paved with plans we've made   
and your headboards never felt   
so safe well they'll reach our graves   
where your friends and   
i will kill the lights and hide   
oh what a nice suprise   
  
dont dont tell me when its coming   
no dont dont i just want to see if for myself   
dont breathe  
dont make a sound cause the song wont stop   
till the tape runs out   
when melody has nothing to hold   
i'll be the last sound that you hear   
as your eyes close   
  
and these chords remain   
we'll use them to exploit the   
friends we've since forgot   
those friends we've lost   
you all know just who you are   
  
cause ive since made graves   
but im too scared to etch the names   
for fear that im the one whos changed   
  
dont dont tell me when its coming   
no dont dont i just want to see if for myself   
dont breathe   
dont make a sound cause the song wont stop   
till the tape runs out   
when melody has nothing to hold   
i'll be the last sound that you hear   
as your eyes close   
  
the thought of death   
it scares me to death   
and i dont know why   
i dont know   
its just too much to never wake up   
  
dont dont tell me when its coming   
no dont dont i just want to see if for myself   
dont breathe  
dont make a sound cause the song wont stop   
till the tape runs out   
when melody has nothing to hold   
i'll be the last sound that you hear   
as your eyes close   
  
when melody has nothing to hold   
i'll be the last sound that you hear   
as your eyes close

7 September 2007 (U.S.) Running time 105 minutes Country United States Language English _**Romance & Cigarettes**_ is a 2006 [musical](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_film) [romantic-comedy film](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_comedy_film) written and directed by [John Turturro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Turturro).  
The film, initially scheduled for an August 2005 release date, was postponed, partly so it could premiere at the [Venice Film Festival](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice_Film_Festival), partly – some speculate – so that it could be better prepared for [Academy Award](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards) nomination.  
The film opened in the [United Kingdom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom) on March 24, 2006, the [Netherlands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands) on March 30, 2006, and the rest of Europe in April 2006. [United Artists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Artists) had been scheduled to distribute the film in the United States, but when the film finally got a limited release on September 7, 2007, director Turturro decided to distribute the film himself. United Artists remains a partial rights holder to the film, but [Icon International](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icon_Productions), actor [Mel Gibson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_Gibson)'s company, now has full distribution rights in the U.S.[[1]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_%26_Cigarettes#cite_note-0) Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer is distributing the film outside the U.S. and [Sony Pictures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Pictures) (under license from Icon International, and ironically a cousin company to UA) released the DVD on February 12, 2008.

User Reviews weird but strangely wonderful  
  
27 March 2006 | by [adamk-2](http://www.imdb.com/user/ur0693416/comments) (London, England)   
"Romance & Cigarettes" is a flawed but endearing film. Its stylised dialogue -- often stitched together from song lyrics, lines from films and, I think, even a snatch of Beckett's Endgame -- its characters bursting into lip-synched song and dance, its strange, disjointed scenes and its total lack of romance will doubtless annoy a lot of people hoping for something somewhat more straightforward and conventional. Personally, I was hoping for something that might address the issues of love, romance and relationships which the film, instead, prodded gently before dancing and singing around them. I would also have liked to have seen more of Mary Louise Parker, who I thought was cruelly underused. And...Eddie Izzard? And yet...and yet...I really liked this film. It had an inventiveness and a quirky charm, a surreal, loopy approach to narrative and dialogue, was beautifully filmed and -- within limitations of the form -- wonderfully acted. Particular kudos to Kate Winslet, unrecognizably and thoroughly dislikeable, who nonetheless "sings" one of the more heart-stopping numbers, Ute Lemper's version of Cave & Piseks "Little Water Song", while underwater. Meanwhile, adding to his gallery of whacked-out and weird characters, Christopher Walken delivers what must be one of his weirdest performances yet as the Elvis-idolising Cousin Bo. Like a lot of things in this film, you have to see it to believe it, and even then you won't be too sure.  
  
I see cultdom beckoning for this little gem, late-night showings, repeated viewings, singalongs and favourite lines of dialogue bandied about like a secret currency. It's unlikely that it would have been made if it wasn't John Turturro writing and the Coens producing, but now it's out there, I recommend it be seen, if only for curiosity value. You either hate it or love it and -- for all its flaws -- I loved it.

EURNZD, 2010 December 02  
  
Daily and H4 could go further down If so then I will take the risk over and will buy again some Enter Longs.  
  
"ttc-combination"  
CCI(14) H1 is showing a bottom and so I take the risk over with an Enter Long meanwhile with EURUSD an Enter Short are running at one and the same time (to the contrary "ttc"). In short time (H1/H4) one currency pair should run in a win and the other then is holding a while longer and could terminate at a higher timeframe (Daily/Weekly).

EURNZD, Monthly, 2010 December 02  
  
If support line will hold position shouldn't be hedged but break the market's fall in the opposite direction.  
  
Monthly could show a divergence, ...if not, then market could go till 1.6420 if big capital will speculate against the Euro.

Looks like Range Box Trading is possible. So do it and wait for a breakout.

Profit: 2'539,96 $ [http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/s...m/thumbsup.gif](http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/smilies/yim/thumbsup.gif)  
  
This is an trading example, where you can wait patiently at M1/M5 and go in the market when you have finalize a decision to enter in only for short moments. Go in and go out quickly and then let the market go by itself. Take your wins out. That's all. Market will offer opportunities all the time.  
  
If you trade with higher lotsizes you can go in and go out of the market like the clappers. There is no need to hold the trade any longer, see EURUSD, M1 and M5 examples below (Profit 1'290.- $), please, e.g. by trade the upper and lower lines of BB.   
  
Be careful and contemplate the "High Lot Trading" (HLT) only with your wins, when your account is in credit and you've reached an advanced trading style level!

Thanks a lot ...

Hello pipfirst  
  
So you can do. Sometimes I look at the MurreyMath Lines or at the pivotal points and when market prices are there I set the market entries in the opposite direction. Often when Market are in a sideway movement I'm oriented towards the upper and lower line of Bollinger Band at M1 or M5 depending to the volatility of the market. Yes!   
  
The EMA Lines (at higher timeframes) could be a great help as support or resistance line then again!   
  
You could also take a look at M15/M30 and if there is a strong trend then set M1 or M5 with the trend.   
  
M1/M5 trading isn't possible trading into profit whole the day. You have well to analyse the market before and wait, if need be... for hours.  
  
May be I will make some records in the following weeks about "M1/M5 trading" and post this here on board.  
  
The Daily Pivots could be helpful reference points where the daily market could go up to. So you can trade the M1 often on the way.  
  
  
Hope it helps!  
  
Kindest regards  
FXcube

USDCAD, H4, 2010 December 03  
  
Enter long at CCI(14) bottom ~ 1.0045 currently.  
  
Daily (CCI 14 bottom, too) and weekly (pos. divergence) seems provide evidence.  
  
If monthly support (see #[**1035**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4217916&postcount=1035), please) from the last four bars and the 2004.10.01 don't hold repetitive downside movement till the murrey math overshoot level [-1/8] at 0.9277 seems equally probable.

Hi Verb  
  
Thank you for your bland words.  
  
It depends of the volatility and the timeframe. By Daily and Weekly often I take one of the pivotal points or the murrey math or I switch at lower timeframes and look if there are any supports or resistance or et vice versa by looking at higher timeframes. Sometimes I go with 4 or 5 trades in the market and take 1 or 2 out of the market after several pips and then I let a part of the rest running further on, wait half of a day or one or two days and look where prices are then. Last one is the breath of the market which I try to collect. Moreover I draw the CCI(14) line in the counterpart direction ever so often and have to point out where the future price could go forth. Also I look if money is enough and go out with a win freelance of the total.  
  
Hope it helps!

It's what I figured, I just had noticed that you entered the price into some of the trades and wondered how there were derived.  
  
Also I would not that if you adjusted your CCI and RSI to 70 periods that would be the equivalent of seeing M5 on your M1 chart.  
  
Ciao

Hi, Forexcube,  
  
A very interesting thread! . I have a quick question, having a look at your today's trades in myfxbook.com , I see there are quite a lot of losing positions, do those positions are part of your overall strategy ?  
  
Regards,  
  
Daniel

Hi again, Forexcube  
  
  
So sorry, didn' t want to sound rude, is just a question, as I' ve been reading your posts about quick trades, and the open positions that appear are long term ones, I was curious about them being on a different timeframe election, or simply losing positions waiting to be closed.  
  
regards,  
  
Daniel

If we start from the assumption that you are aware of "hedging",...oh here again,... so you will make it more stupid, ...quirky!

[Home](http://www.metatrader.info/) » [Mql - Metatrader Development Course](http://www.metatrader.info/node/34)  
**Welcome to MQL4 course!**  
  
**W** elcome to the MQL4 course.   
In this series, I will try to strip the mystique and confusion from MQL4 by giving you comprehensive tutorials with a straight forward example.   
In this series of lessons, I will show you how to use the MQL4 for building your own Expert Advisors, Custom Indicators and Scripts.  
[http://www.metatrader.info/system/fi...atformlogo.gif](http://www.metatrader.info/system/files?file=metatraderplatformlogo.gif)  
If you are programming in C (or its superset C++) then you know a lot of MQL4 before even I start my lessons, if you didn’t write in any programming language before, no problem, I’ll guide you to understand the concept of programming in general as well.  
So, let’s start from the beginning.  
**MQL4? What, Why and Where?**  
MQL4 stands for **M** eta**Q** uotes **L** anguage **4.**  
MetaQuotes is the company who built the MetaTrader Trading Platform.  
And to make it stronger than the other trading platforms the company extended it by a built-in programming language that enables the user (you) to write his own trading strategies.  
The language enables you to create one of the following:  
1- **Expert Advisors**.  
2- **Custom Indicators**.  
3- **Scripts**.  
• **Expert Advisor** is a program which can automate trading deals for you. For example it can automate your market orders, stops orders automatically, cancels/replaces orders and takes your profit.   
• **Custom Indicator** is a program which enables you to use the functions of the technical indicators and it cannot automate your deals.  
• **Script** is a program designed for single function execution. Unlike the Advisor, scripts are being held only once (on demand), and not by ticks. And of course has no access to indicator functions.  
These were “What” MQL4 is? “Why” to use MQL4?  
Now, “Where” do I write MQL4?  
To write your MQL4 code and as anything else in world, you can choose one of two ways, the hard way and the easy way.  
**1- The hard way:**  
The hard way is using your favorite text editor and the command prompt to compile your program.   
Notepad is not bad choice, but do not forget two things:  
1- To save the file you have created in plain text format.  
2- To save the file as .mp4 (that’s to be easy to reopen it with MetaEditor), but you can save it as any extension you prefer.  
After saving your program there is an extra step to make your code comes out to the light.  
It’s the Compiling step.  
Compiling means to convert the human readable script that you have just wrote to the machine language that your computer understands.  
MetaTrader has been shipped with its own compiler (the program which will convert your script to the machine language) called **MetaLang.exe**.  
Metalang.exe is a console program which takes two parameters and output an **.ex4** file (the file which Metatrader understands).  
The first parameter is “options” parameter and the only option available is **–q** quit  
The second parameter is the full path to your .mql file.  
The syntax will be in this format.  
metalang [options…] filename  
**Example:**  
1- Find your metalang.exe path, it will be the same path of MetaTrader (here my path is D![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)rogram FilesMetaTrader 4).  
2- Create a batch file and name it compile.bat (or any name you prefer).  
3- Write these lines into the bat file then save it:  
_cd D![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1) rogram FilesMetaTrader 4  
metalang -q "D![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)rogram FilesMetaTrader 4my_first_mql4_script.mq4"  
_(Don’t forget to change the path to you MetaTrader installed path).  
4- Run the batch file and if you are lucky person like me you will get a screen like figure 1.   

[http://www.metatrader.info/system/fi...on1_image1.jpg](http://www.metatrader.info/system/files?file=lesson1_image1.jpg)   
_Figure 1 Metalang compiler_

As you see you will get the output file “my_first_mql4_script.ex4”  
**2-The easy way:**  
Metatrader has been shipped with a good IDE (integrated development editor) called MetaEditor which has these features:  
1- A text editor has the feature of highlighting different constructions of MQL4 language while you are writing/reading code.  
2- Easy to compile your program, just click F5 and the MetaEditor will make all the hard work for you and produces the “ex4” file.   
Besides it’s easy to see what the wrong in your program is (in the Error Tab – see figure 2).  
3- Built-in a dictionary book which you can access by highlight the keyword you want to know further about it then press F1.  
  

  

_Figure 2 MetaEditor 4_

In the coming lessons we will know more about MetaEditor.  
Today I just came to say hello, tomorrow we will start the real works and will study the Syntax of MQL4.  
_I welcome very much the questions and the suggestions._  
**See you

Project Work  
  
May be we can work out together a CCI(14) Top and Bottom EA at H4 & Daily.  
  
If anybody collaborate, so we'll develop a CCI EA in the next months.  
  
Kindest regards

By means of this CCI-(14) indicator (with 3 levels: -100, 0, +100) you can't switch the periods of the schedule in the MetaTrader. You'll have all the periods in one's sight  
  
Examples: EURUSD M5 & H1, 2010 December 05  
  
Self-explanatory!  
  
Hope it helps!

Trade the CCI(14) Tops and Bottoms  
  
Do the Right Thing CCI Trade  
  
Without resorting to the mathematics of the indicator, please note that CCI is an unbounded oscillator with any reading of +100* typically considered to be overbought and any reading of -100* oversold. For our purposes, however, we will use these levels as our trigger points as we put a twist on the traditional interpretation of CCI. We actually look to buy if the currency pair makes a new high above 100* and sell if the currency pair makes a new low below -100*. In “do the right thing” we are looking for new peaks or spikes in momentum that are likely to carry the currency pair higher or lower. The thesis behind this setup is that much like a body hurtled in motion will remain so until it’s slowed by counterforces, new highs or lows in CCI will propel the currency further in the direction of the move before new prices finally put a halt to the advance or the decline.  
  
**Rules for the Long Trade**  
1\. On the daily, H4 or the hourly charts place the CCI indicator with standard input of -100/-150/-200.  
2\. Note the very last time the CCI registered a reading of greater than +100* before dropping back below the +100* zone.  
3\. Take a measure of the peak CCI reading and record it.  
4. If CCI once again trades above the +100* (z) and if its value exceeds the prior peak (a) reading (z > a), go long at market at the close of the candle.*  
...or if its value (z) fall below the prior peak (a) (z < a; a > z) then trade the negative divergence with one more entry sell order down [switches between the timeframes and look in what way is the difference from each others (trending or sideways market)] .  
5\. Measure the low of the candle and use it as your stop.  
6\. If the position moves in your favor by the amount of your original stop, sell half and move stop to breakeven.  
7\. Take profit on the rest of the trade when position moves to two times your stop.  
**  
Rules for the Short Trade**  
1\. On the daily, H4 or the hourly charts place the CCI indicator with standard input of +100/+150/+200.  
2\. Note the very last time the CCI registered a reading of less than -100* before poking above the -100* zone.  
3\. Take a measure of the peak CCI reading and record it.  
4. If CCI once again trades below the -100* (z) and if its value exceeds the prior low (a) reading (z > a), go short at market at the close of the candle,*  
...or if its value (z) undercut the prior (a) low (z < a; a > z), then trade the positive divergence with one more entry buy order up [switches between the timeframes and look in what way is the difference from each others (trending or sideways market)].  
5\. Measure the high of the candle and use it as your stop.  
6\. If the position moves in your favor by the amount of your original stop, sell half and move the stop on the remainder of the position to breakeven.  
7\. Take profit on the rest of the trade when position moves to two times your stop.  
  
  
Annotation:  
*At shorter time frames (M1, M5, M15, M30, H1, H4) use +150 and/or +200 and -150 and/or -200 Level and at higher timeframes (Daily, Weekly, Monthly) use the +100 and -100 Line.  
  
*Not in the sideway market, only at higher-time-frames-trending-market. (See chart below, please).

This is one time frame analysis and imagine if we use multitimeframe How powerful it will be?! we have to ask Forexcube " don't leave us teach as more about CCI Tops and Bottoms".

I don't trade any longer at  
  
<http://www.myfxbook.com/members/Forexcube>  
  
due to the fact that 100% win will be reached this month.  
  
So I let all actual open positions running in the win any longer.  
  
My target 250.-$ a Day has surpassed. Now it could be only "deadly boredom".  
  
So I begin the next one demo account with 50'000.-$ called "Aelliot50K"  
  
see at:  
  
<http://www.myfxbook.com/members/Aelliot50K>  
  
and under  
  
[www.Aelliot.org](http://www.Aelliot.org)  
  
It was nice to talk with you.  
  
Good Bye!  
  
Au revoir!  
  
Good bye!  
  
So long!  
  
Ta-Ta!

EURAUD, Daily, 2010 December 07  
  
EURAUD shows a daily (and monthly, see #[**1069**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4225100&postcount=1069), please) divergence. Murrey Math is at the "Extreme Overshoot Level" [-2/8] and would hedge the downs with EURUSD or EURAUD if needs must.  
  
...and H4 CCI(14) at the bottom, too. (see #[**1069**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4225100&postcount=1069), please)

Either big capital speculates Silver into an astronomical twilight or it's time for a down.  
  
Daily & monthly bars are showing a divergence, so H4, too.

TRYJPY, Daily, 2010 December 07  
  
Could be a possible way to set a Pending Order (5/10 positions) and try to trade the range between 54.70 - 57.70.  
  
If market prices will cross the H1 middle line of BB at 55.75 then go in with (3/10 positions) indifferent if pending order will triggered but it seems that the market price will go further down. We don't know! We'll see!  
  
Kindest regards

EURUSD, Daily, 2010 December 07  
  
If the price won't cross the middle line of BB further downside movements seems possible.  
  
I try to trade the range at shorter timeframes (M1/M5) and some big ones only down - but 1.3780 also possible (may be then hedge some few).

Pending Orders could maximize your risk-reward-ratio-power.  
  
Def.  
An order that will not execute until the price reaches a level selected by the trader.

****Pending Orders****  
  
A Pending order is an instruction to open a position when the current price reaches the order level.  
There are four types of pending orders:

  1. Buy Stop - an order to open a Buy position at a price higher than the price at the moment of placing the order.
  2. Sell Stop - an order to open a Sell position at a price lower than the price at the moment of placing the order.
  3. Buy Limit - an order to open a Buy position at a lower price than the price at the moment of placing the order.
  4. Sell Limit - an order to open a Sell position at a price higher than the price at the moment of placing the order.

**6 Steps To A Rule-Based Forex Trading System**  
  
****by Selwyn Gishen** ([Contact Author](http://www.investopedia.com/contact.aspx?ContentType=A&Subject=Investopedia%20Contact%20Form&ContentID=6181) | [Biography](http://www.investopedia.com/contributors/default.aspx?id=216))**  
A trading system is more than just having a rule or set of rules for when to enter and when to exit a trade. It is a comprehensive strategy that takes into account six very important factors, not the least of which is your own personality. In this article, we will cover the general approach to creating a rule-based trading system. (To learn more, check out our _[Trading Systems Tutorial](http://www.investopedia.com/university/tradingsystems/)_.)   
**  
Step 1: Examine Your Mindset  
**(A) _Know who you are:_ When trading the markets, your first priority is to take a look at yourself and note your own personality traits. Examine your strengths and your weaknesses, then ask yourself how you might react if you perceive an opportunity or how you might react if your position is threatened. This is also known as a personal [SWOT analysis](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swot.asp). But do not lie to yourself. If you are not sure how you would act, ask the opinion of someone who knows you well. (To learn more, see _[Does Your Personality Match Your Trading Methods?](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/10/mental-time-frame-match-trading.asp)_) (B) _Match your personality to your trading:_ Be sure that you are comfortable with the type of trading conditions you will experience in different time frames. For example, if you have determined that you are not the kind of person who likes to go to sleep with open positions in a market that is trading while you sleep, perhaps you should consider [day trading](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/daytrader.asp) so that you can close out your positions before you go home. However, you must then be the kind of person who likes the adrenalin rush of constantly watching the computer throughout the day. Do you enjoy being computer-bound? Are you an addictive or compulsive person? Will you drive yourself crazy watching your positions and become afraid to go to the bathroom in case you miss a tick? If you are not sure, go back and re-audit your personality to be certain. Unless your trading style matches your personality, you will not enjoy what you are doing and you will quickly lose your passion for trading. (For more, see _[Day Trading: An Introduction](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/05/011705.asp)_.)  
(C) _Be prepared_ : Plan your trade so you can trade your plan. Preparation is the mental dry run of your potential trades - a kind of dress rehearsal. By planning your trade in advance, you are setting the ground rules, as well as your limits. If you know what you are looking for and how you plan to act if the market does what you anticipate, you will be able to be objective and stand aside from the fear/greed cycle.  
(D) _Be objective_ : Do not become emotionally involved in your trade. It does not matter whether you are wrong or right. What matters, as [George Soros](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/soros.asp) says, is that “you make more money when you are right than what you lose when you are wrong.” Trading is not about ego, although for most of us it can be disconcerting when we plan a trade, apply our entire logical prowess and then find out that the market does not agree. It is a matter of training yourself to accept that not every trade can be a winning trade, and that you must accept small losses gracefully and move on to the next trade.   
(E) _Be disciplined_ : This means that you have to know when to buy and sell. Base your decisions on your pre-planned strategy and stick to it. Sometimes you will cut out of a position only to find that it turns around and would have been profitable had you held on to it. But this is the basis of a very bad habit. Don’t ignore your [stop losses](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stop-lossorder.asp) \- you can always get back into a position. You will find it more reassuring to cut out and accept a small loss than to start wishing that your large loss will be recouped when the market rebounds. This would more resemble trading your ego than trading the market.   
(F) _Be patient_ : When it comes to trading, patience truly is a virtue. Learn to sit on your hands until the market gets to the point where you have drawn your line in the sand. If it does not get to your entry point, what have you lost? There is always going to be an opportunity to make gains another day. (For tips on patient investing, read _[Patience Is A Trader’s Virtue](http://www.investopedia.com/www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/07/patient_investor.asp)._)  
  
(G) _Have realistic expectations_ : This means that you won’t lose your focus on reality and miraculously expect to turn $1,000 into $1 million 10 trades. What is a realistic expectation? Consider what some of the best [fund](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/10/making-a-rule-based-trading-system.asp?partner=fxweekly12#) managers in the world are capable of achieving - perhaps anywhere from 20-50% per annum. Most of them achieve much less than that and are well-paid to do so. Go into trading expecting a realistic rate of return on a consistent basis; if you manage to achieve a growth rate of 20% or better every year, you will be able to outperform many of the professional fund managers. (For more, see _[Gauge Portfolio Performance By Measuring Returns](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/fundamental-analysis/08/performance-analytics-returns.asp)_.)  
  
**Step 2: Identify Your Mission and Set Your Goals  
**(A) With anything in life, if you don’t know where you are going, any road will take you there. In terms of investing, this means you must sit down with your calculator and determine what kind of returns you need to reach your [financial](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/10/making-a-rule-based-trading-system.asp?partner=fxweekly12#) goals.   
(B) Next, you must start to understand how much you need to earn in a trade and how often you will have to trade to achieve your goals. Don’t forget to factor in losing trades. This can bring you to the realization that your trading methodology may be in conflict with your goals. Therefore, it is critical to align your methodology with your goals. If you are trading in standard 100,000 lots, your average value of a [pip](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pip.asp) is around $10. So how many pips can you expect to earn per trade? Take your last 20 trades and add up the winners and losers and then determine your profits. Use this to forecast the returns on your current methodology. Once you know this information, you can figure out if you can achieve your goals and whether or not you are being realistic. (To learn more, see _[How Does Leverage Affect Pip Value?](http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/leverageandpipvalue.asp)_)  
  
**Step 3: Ensure You Have Enough Money  
**(A) [Cash](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/10/making-a-rule-based-trading-system.asp?partner=fxweekly12#) is the fuel needed to start trading and without enough cash, your trading will be hampered by a lack of liquidity. But more important, cash is a cushion against losing trades. Without a cushion, you will not be able to withstand a temporary drawdown or be able to give your position enough breathing space while the market moves back and forth with new trends.  
(B) Cash cannot come from sources that you need for other important events in your life, such as your [savings](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/10/making-a-rule-based-trading-system.asp?partner=fxweekly12#) plan for your children’s college education. Cash in trading accounts is “[risk](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk.asp)” money. Also known as [risk capital,](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskcapital.asp) this money is an amount that you can afford to lose without affecting your lifestyle. Consider trading money as you would vacation savings. You know that when the vacation is over the money will be spent and you are OK with that. Trading carries a high degree of risk. Treating your [trading capital](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trading-capital.asp) as vacation money does not mean that you are not serious about protecting your [capital](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/10/making-a-rule-based-trading-system.asp?partner=fxweekly12#), rather it means freeing yourself psychologically from the fear of losing so that you can actually make the trades that will be necessary to grow your capital. Again, perform a personal [SWOT analysis](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swot.asp) to be sure the necessary trading positions aren’t contrasting with your personality profile.  
  
**Step 4: Select a Market That Trades Harmoniously  
**(A) Pick a [currency pair](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currencypair.asp) and test it over different time frames. Start with the weekly charts, then proceed to daily, four-hour, two-hour, one-hour, 30-minute, 10-minute and five-minute charts. Try to determine whether the market turns at strategic points most of the time, such as at [Fibonacci levels](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fibonacciretracement.asp), trendlines or [moving averages](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/movingaverage.asp). This will give you a feeling of how the currency trades in the different time frames.  
(B) Set up support and resistance levels in different time frames to see if any of these levels cluster together. For example, the price at 127 Fibonacci extension on the weekly time frame may also be the price at a 1.618 extension off of a daily time frame. Such a cluster would add conviction to the support or resistance at that price point. (To learn more, see _[Advanced Fibonacci Applications](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/05/AdvFibonacci.asp)_.)  
Repeat this exercise with different currencies until you find the currency pair that you feel is the most predictable for your methodology.  
(C) Remember, passion is key to trading. The repeated testing of your set-ups requires that you love what you are doing. With enough passion you will learn to accurately gauge the market.  
(D) Once you have a currency pair that you feel comfortable with, start reading the news and the comments regarding the particular pair you have selected. Try to determine if the fundamentals are supporting what you believe the chart is telling you. For example, if gold is going up, that would probably be good for the Australian dollar, since gold is a commodity that is generally positively correlated to the Australian dollar. If you think gold is going to go down, then wait for the appropriate time on the chart to [short](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/short.asp) the [Aussie](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aussie.asp). Look for a line of resistance to be the appropriate line in the sand to get timing confirmation before you make the trade.   
  
**Step 5: Test Your Methodology for Positive Results  
**(A) This step is probably what most traders really think of as the most important part of trading: A system that enters and exits trades that are only profitable. No losses - ever. Such a system, if there were one, would make a trader rich beyond his wildest dreams. But the truth is, there is no such system. There are good methodologies and better ones and even very average methods that can all be used to make money. The performance of a trading system is more about the trader than it is about the system. A good driver can get to his destination in virtually any vehicle, but an untrained driver will probably not make it, no matter how great fast the car is. (Sometimes the best system is a mixture of methods. To learn more, read _[_Blending Technical And Fundamental Analysis_](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/07/technical-fundamental.asp)_.)  
(B) Having said the above, it is necessary to pick a methodology and implement it many times in different time frames and markets to measure its success rate. Often a system is a successful predictor of the market direction only 55-60% of the time, but with proper [risk management](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskmanagement.asp), the trader can still make a lot of money employing such a system.   
(C) Personally, I like to use a system that has the highest reward to risk, which means that I tend to look for turning points at support and resistance levels because these are the points where it is easiest to identify and quantify the risk. Support is not always strong enough to stop a falling market, nor is resistance always strong enough to turn back an advance in prices. However, a system can be built around the concept of support and resistance to give a trader the edge required to be profitable.   
(D) Once you have designed your system, it is important to measure its expectancy or reliability in various conditions and time frames. If it has a positive expectancy (it produces more profitable trades than losing trades) it can be used as a means to time entry and exit in the markets.  
  
**Step 6: Measure Your Risk-to-Reward Ratios and Set Your Limits  
**(A) The first line in the sand to draw is where you would exit your position if the market goes against you. This is where you will place your stop loss.  
(B) Calculate the number of pips your stop is away from your [entry point](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/Entry-Point.asp). If the stop is 20 pips away from the entry point and you are trading a standard lot, then each pip is worth approximately $10 (if the U.S. dollar is your [quote currency](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quotecurrency.asp)). Use a pip calculator if you are trading in cross currencies to make it easy to get the value of a pip.  
(C) Calculate the percentage your stop loss would be as a percentage of your trading capital. For example, if you have $1,000 in your trading account, 2% would be $20. Be sure your stop loss is not more than $20 away from your entry point. If 20 pips are equal to $200, then you are too leveraged for your available trading capital. To overcome this, you must reduce your trading size from a standard lot to a [mini-lot](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mini-lot.asp). One pip in a mini-lot is equal to approximately $1. Therefore, to maintain your 2% risk-to-capital, the maximum loss should be $20, which requires that you trade only one mini-lot. (For more on minis, see _[_Forex Minis Shrink Risk Exposure_](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/08/mini-lot.asp)_.)  
(D) Now draw a line on your chart where you would want to take profit. Be sure this is at least 40 pips away from your entry point. This will give you a 2:1 profit-to-loss ratio. Since you cannot know for sure if the market will reach this point, be sure to slide your stop to breakeven as soon as the market moves beyond your entry point. At worst, you will scratch your trade and your full capital will be intact.  
(E) If you get knocked out on your first attempt, don’t despair. Often it is your second entry that will be correct. It is true that “the second mouse gets the cheese.” Often the market will bounce off your support if you are buying, or retreat from your resistance if you are selling, and you will enter the trade to test that level to see if the market will trade back to your support or resistance. You can then catch profits the second time around.  
  
**Summary**  
By fusing psychology, fundamentals, a trading methodology and risk management, you’ll have the tools to select an appropriate currency pair. All that is left to do is repeatedly practice trading until the strategy is ingrained in your psyche. With enough passion and determination, you will become a successful trader.

How does leverage work in the forex market?   
  
The concept of [leverage](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverage.asp) is used by both investors and companies. Investors use leverage to significantly increase the returns that can be provided on an investment. They lever their [investments](http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/forexleverage.asp?partner=fxweekly12#) by using various instruments that include [options](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp), [futures](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futures.asp) and [margin accounts](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marginaccount.asp). Companies can use leverage to finance their assets. In other words, instead of issuing stock to raise capital, companies can use debt financing to invest in [business](http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/forexleverage.asp?partner=fxweekly12#) operations in an attempt to increase shareholder value. (For more insight, see _[_What do people mean when they say that debt is a relatively cheaper form of finance than equity?_](http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/debtcheaperthanequity.asp)_)  
  
In [forex](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forex.asp), [investors](http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/forexleverage.asp?partner=fxweekly12#) use leverage to profit from the fluctuations in [exchange rates](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchangerate.asp) between two different countries. The leverage that is achievable in the forex market is one of the highest that investors can obtain. Leverage is a loan that is provided to an [investor](http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/forexleverage.asp?partner=fxweekly12#) by the broker that is handling his or her forex account. When an investor decides to invest in the forex market, he or she must first open up a margin account with a broker. Usually, the amount of leverage provided is either 50:1, 100:1 or 200:1, depending on the broker and the size of the position the investor is trading. Standard trading is done on 100,000 units of currency, so for a trade of this size, the leverage provided is usually 50:1 or 100:1. Leverage of 200:1 is usually used for positions of $50,000 or less.  
  
To trade $100,000 of currency, with a margin of 1%, an investor will only have to deposit $1,000 into his or her margin account. The leverage provided on a trade like this is 100:1. Leverage of this size is significantly larger than the 2:1 leverage commonly provided on equities and the 15:1 leverage provided by the futures market. Although 100:1 leverage may seem extremely risky, the [risk](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk.asp) is significantly less when you consider that currency prices usually change by less than 1% during [intraday](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intraday.asp) trading. If currencies fluctuated as much as equities, brokers would not be able to provide as much leverage.  
  
Although the ability to earn significant profits by using leverage is substantial, leverage can also work against investors. For example, if the currency underlying one of your trades moves in the opposite direction of what you believed would happen, leverage will greatly amplify the potential losses. To avoid such a catastrophe, forex traders usually implement a strict trading style that includes the use of [stop](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stoporder.asp) and [limit orders](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/limitorder.asp).

An interface or "go-between" that enables a software program to interact with other software. In the context of forex trading, an API refers to the interface or platform that enables your platform to connect with the market. APIs have multiple features that facilitate information sharing, including real-time forex price quotations, trade execution and order and trade confirmations.

Proprietary APIs are offered by almost every major online forex brokerage. Because the fast-paced nature of forex trading makes automated trading preferable to manual trading for most traders, a reliable API is an important differentiator for a forex brokerage to ensure stable operation and execution of trades.

****Daily Report: RBA on Hold, BoC Next****  
  
FX markets are generally steady in range for the moment. No new decision was made in the meeting of EU finance ministers overnight. There were detailed discussion with IMF chief Strauss-Kahn and it's believed that IMF has pushed for an increase in the EUR 750b crisis fund but got no support from the Eurogroup. Also, there was no decision on immediate bailout of Portugal and Spain. Focus will turn to Irish Parliament vote on the 2011 budget which is expected to include EUR 6b savings. The first tranche of the EUR 85b bailout fund will be triggered once the budget is approved. However, the majority os the leading party is thin and the consequence of failing to pass the budget could be disastrous to Ireland and spread contagion to other Eurozone countries.

****Mid-Day Report: Dollar Lower on Risk Appetite; BoC on Hold****  
  
Dollar recovery was brief and is back under pressure today. There are lots of news today, including US president Obama's announcement to extend tax breaks, as well as talk of China rate hike around the weekend. But these news have little impact in the markets. Instead, solid risk appetite is driving the greenback down. In particular, gold's up trend resumes today and makes another record high near to 1430 level. Crude oil also manages to break through 90 psychological level. Strongest strength is seen in Aussie which extends this week's rally against dollar and is trading above 0.995. Sterling is also higher, together with Euro, on optimism of austerity budget approval in Ireland.

Hi kiscan  
  
Nice to hear that you enjoy the comments.  
Thank you for your benevolent words. I trade on my real account the same way, of course. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Let's see?  
  
Could be that a blog will be started at [www.aelliot.org](http://www.aelliot.org)  
Seems there are a large interest how I (and other famous traders) manage these trades more in detail.  
PhAnTi' is making a good work there.  
(It seems to be for all Americanese, English speaking or Germans may be the Francophone, too).

EURUSD, Daily, 2010 December 09  
  
Look at this strong daily resistance line, please - and the market price is moving down always below the middle line of BB - and then you can switch at H4 or more smaller.  
  
So look at H4 chart and trade the resistance line (always down) with setting a stop loss above.   
  
I wish you success and happiness!

EURUS, H1, 2010 December 09  
  
Here you could see a great example, where a powerful market movement at H4 and Daily could lever out the rules of smaller time frames.  
Normally you trade at point A1 at H1 up, but due to the fact that the bigger timeframes are showinfg a down, H1 arguments couldn't be further powerful. So concentrate at H1 if the market price will pierce through the support line. The green Hammer say okay we could go up (pro), but the ADX(14) > 25 (not on the chart) is signing a stronger downward trend (contra). So you have some pro and some contra and what I would make is trading only smaller time frames (M1/M5) till the market environment will getting more clearer. I think EURUSD is out of control and has actual reached an "extremely strong speculative currency pair" so heavy ups and downs could be always expected.  
  
Kindest regards

critique:  
Some trades in the night were triggered too early. An even better profit had been made by waiting a little longer till the market price has reached the upper resistance line at H1, H4, Daily (see #[**1101**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4232325&postcount=1101), #[**1100**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4232293&postcount=1100), please).

I don't know if I will make trades at Friday. Friday is spoof (piss-take) time by the Brokers and the Big Capital. Market seems often to be out of order, mostly 14:00-15:00 GMT +1.  
  
...true or false?

EURUSD  
  
Monthly (#[**1109**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4233685&postcount=1109)) is showing a trend channel and the Weekly (#[**1109**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4233685&postcount=1109)) are struggling around the middle line of Bollinger Band (BB). Daily ( #[**1110**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4233686&postcount=1110) ) has pointed out an indifferent candle whereas H4 ( #[**1110**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4233686&postcount=1110) ) is famous for one of these positive divergence again here (but tomorrow is the "crazy friday" again) and M30 ( #[**1111**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4233687&postcount=1111)) are showing indifferent candles with some little ups and downs, so it's better to go on holiday or trade a little at M1/M5 the Pivotal Points.  
  
I prefere to stay at the sideline and wait. May be some M1/M5 here and there.   
  
For me I won't trade tomorrow, may be just a little. I'll take the opportunity to analyse variant types of currency pairs (Major Currency Pairs, Major Cross-Currency Pairs and Minor Currency Pairs, may be some Exotivc Pairs) - if there could work out some pattern detection.

Very helpful, thank you. I am going through all the relevant links on page # 1 and so all explanations on how you combine higher and lower timeframes to analyze the market is very informative.  
  
I have signed up at your blog, is this going to be a signal site or ( preferably ) an educational/information site ?  
  
I wrongly seemed to have thought that CCI is only good on 3min or 5min like Woodie traded the indices....

Hi msmarple  
  
This blog is created by PhAnTi'. May be that a "FXcube-blog" will be created or something like that. Aelliot is the administrator. I make all the trades at this "Aelliot50K" Account here at FF which PhAnTi' copy at this marvellous blog. So PhAnTi' has many ideas how develop this blog in the future. So may be we'll see next time some of his excellent work more.

GBPNZD, Weekly, 2010 December 10  
  
To apply a great deal of attention to the "pound kiwi".  
  
My be also good for some trades earlier at H1/H4 before the big market move could coming (may be this month or the following one?,..tomorrow?, ...we don't know!).  
  
If the pound will be coming back (say by a definitely cross at the weekly upper line of BB around 2.2175) this currency pair could develop a strong power for a real long uptrending process.   
  
Before there could be good trading aspects at H1/H4.

**Trading Spot FX is Decentralized**  
  
Unlike in trading stocks or futures, you don't need to go through a centralized exchange like the New York Stock Exchange with just one price. In the forex market, there is no single price that for a given currency at any time, which means quotes from different currency dealers vary.   
  
[](http://www.babypips.com/school/images/pre-school/decentralized-market.png)[http://www.babypips.com/school/image...zed-market.png](http://www.babypips.com/school/images/pre-school/decentralized-market.png)  
  
"So many choices! Awesome!"   
This might be overwhelming at first, but this is what makes the forex market so freakin' awesome! The market is so huge and the competition between dealers is so fierce that you get the best deal almost every single time. And tell me, who does not want that?  
Also, one cool thing about forex trading is that you can do it anywhere.

**The FX Ladder**  
  
Even though the forex market is decentralized, it isn't pure and utter chaos! The participants in the FX market can be organized into a ladder. To better understand what we mean, here is a neat illustration:   

[](http://www.babypips.com/school/images/pre-school/fx-ladder.png)[http://www.babypips.com/school/image.../fx-ladder.png](http://www.babypips.com/school/images/pre-school/fx-ladder.png)

  
At the very top of the forex market ladder is the interbank market. Composed of the largest banks of the world and some smaller banks, the participants of this market trade directly with each other or electronically through the Electronic Brokering Services (EBS) or the Reuters Dealing 3000-Spot Matching.   
  
The competition between the two companies - the EBS and the Reuters Dealing 3000-Spot Matching - is similar to Coke and Pepsi. They are in constant battle for clients and continually try to one-up each other for market share. While both companies offer most currency pairs, some currency pairs are more liquid on one than the other.   
  
For the EBS plaform, EUR/USD, USD/JPY, EUR/JPY, EUR/CHF, and USD/CHF are more liquid. Meanwhile, for the Reuters platform, GBP/USD, EUR/GBP, USD/CAD, AUD/USD, and NZD/USD are more liquid.   
  
All the banks that are part of the interbank market can see the rates that each other is offering, but this doesn't necessarily mean that anyone can make deals at those prices.   
  
Like in real life, the rates will largely dependent on the established **CREDIT** relationship between the trading parties. Just to name a few, there's the "B.F.F. rate," the "customer rate," and the "ex-wife-you-took-everything rate." It's like asking for a loan at your local bank. The better your credit standing and reputation with them, the better the interest rates and the larger loan you can avail.   
Next on the ladder are the hedge funds, corporations, retail market makers and retail ECNs. Since these institutions do not have tight credit relationships with the participants of the interbank market, they have to do their transactions via commercial banks. This means that their rates are slightly higher and more expensive than those who are part of the interbank market.   
At the very bottom of the ladder are the retail traders. It used to be very hard for us little people to engage in the forex market but, thanks to the advent of the internet, electronic trading, and retail brokers, the difficult barriers to entry in forex trading have all been taken down.   
  
This gave us the chance to play with those high up the ladder and poke them with a very long and cheap stick.

**The Speculators**  
  
"In it to win it!"  
This is probably the mantra of the speculators. Comprising close to 90% of all trading volume, speculators come in all shapes and sizes. Some have fat pockets, some roll thin, but all of them engage in the forex simply to make bucket loads of cash.   
Don't worry... Once you graduate from the School of Pipsology, you can be part of this cool crowd!

**Market Hours**  
  
[http://www.babypips.com/school/image...hool/clock.png](http://www.babypips.com/school/images/pre-school/clock.png) Before looking at the best times to trade, we must look at what a 24 hour day in the forex world looks like.   
The forex market can be broken up into four major trading sessions: the Sydney session, the Tokyo session, the London session, and the New York session. Below are tables of the open and close times for each session:

You can see that in between each session, there is a period of time where two sessions are open at the same time. From 3:00-4:00 am EDT, both the Tokyo and London markets are open, and from 8:00-12:00 am EDT, both the London and New York markets are open.   
  
  
  
Naturally, these are the busiest times during the market because there is more volume when two markets are open at the same time. This makes sense because during those times, all the market participants are wheelin' and dealin', which means that more money is transferring hands.   
  
  
  
Now, you're probably looking at the Sydney open and thinking why it shifts two hours. You'd think that Sydney's open would only move one hour when the U.S. adjusts for standard time, but remember that when the U.S. shifts one hour back, Sydney actually moves forward by one hour (seasons are opposite in Australia). You should always remember this if you ever plan to trade during that time period.

For more information about forex trading hours, you can check out Let's take a look at the average pip movement of the major currency pairs during each trading session.  
  
From the table, you will see that the European session normally provides the most movement.

**Best Times to Trade:**  

  1. When two sessions are overlapping of course! These are also the times where major news events come out to potentially spark some volatility and directional movements. Make sure you bookmark the Market Hours cheat sheet to take note of the Opening and Closing times.
  2. The European session tends to be the busiest out of the three.
  3. The middle of the week typically shows the most movement, as the pip range widens for most of the major currency pairs.

**Worst Times to Trade:**  

  1. Sundays - everyone is sleeping or enjoying their weekend!
  2. Fridays - liquidity dies down during the latter part of the U.S. session.
  3. Holidays - everybody is taking a break.
  4. Major news events - you don't want to get whipsawed!
  5. During American Idol, the NBA Finals, or the Superbowl.

GBPUSD, Monthly, 2010 December 11  
GBPUSD, Weekly 2010 December 11  
  
Monthly and Weekly seems to move the market price within the triangle.  
  
So it's better to wait here for a breakout, ... and if so,... then it could be a strong movement either up or down.

GBPUSD, Daily, 2010 December 11  
GBPUSD, H4, 2010 December 11  
  
The Daily is omne of the important now, lines are getting extremly narrow, so a breakout could expected with a higher probability, isnt it?  
  
H4: ...the most powerful chart here!  
...but at H4 we see a divergence and the EMA200 seems to be a strong support line. So if you get in the market with some enter shorts take the stop loss over the EMA200 line. EMA20 has crossong the EMA50 at point P1 so it could be that the EMA50 is considered to be a new support line in conjunction with the lower line of BB.  
H4 seems one of the most powerful charts if EMA lines like EMA20 and EMA50 are crossing and then the ups and downs between the upper line of BB and its middle line will command the price.

GBPUSD, H1, 2010 December 11  
GBPUSD, M30, 2010 December 11  
  
Oh yes!, ...of course!, this kind of trading at H1 and M30 with a tighter spread major currency like GBPUSD is really self-explenatory!  
  
At **H1** you can trades the CCI(149) Tops and Bottoms with the upper line of BB (P3, P4, P5, P6) and the EMA100 support line (P1, P2) and by trading the**M30** could be a great adventure by looking at CCI(14) Tops and Bottoms with the Pivotal Points. When EMA lines are heading for crossing you could often bet that the prices will run up to a higher important pivotal point, also when it's working out a divergence.  
  
Hope it helps!  
  
Kindest regards!

Hi Forexcube,  
  
I am still taking the time to study this thread more in detail. Although it includes an indicator such as CCI, I think the MTF approach and use of S&R ( or Murr. Math lines ) make it unique. That is to say, you dont use the indicators for immediate buy/sell signals, but just as an addon to measure the momentum and real strength of the wave-like character of price. Very well done. It may need a long time of practice in terms of simple screentime, but it is worth it.  
  
IMHO this is also one of the best threads for newer traders, apart from the J16 thread.  
  
My favourite post is still : EURUSD 1h  
  
  
Thank you and have a nice weekend !

Hi Michael  
  
When young I saw a lot of this fine lady "Ms. Marple" at a time where actors had have excellent speaking-parts (not an action role).   
  
Thank you!

see #[**1131**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4236751&postcount=1131), please.  
  
Hi msmarple  
  
Smaller timeframes like H1 - see also this idea:  
It is a simple method. You could use the 10 EMA. After you get an entry signal from the CCI Indicator (Top or Bottom), you could wait till a price bar closes below (above) 10 EMA to enter Short (Long). This method could help you to know when exactly you will enter and so you should have no second doubt about acting now or waiting a bit longer.  
At the second enter short trade I would take the risk over to enter short at the price action (see the shooting star), may be with some more enter shorts at the 10 EMA crossover three bars later. You've to wait till the close of the candle ist at the other side of 10 EMA.   
  
See also the Zig-Zag-Indicator at #[**1134**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4236871&postcount=1134), please.

May be it is very useful to support decisions in making entries when following the CCI(14) Top-and-Bottom-Trading.  
  
This is a Zig-Zag-Indicator, which is not repainted.  
  
  
Corrigendum (1h34am):  
see #[**1135**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4236893&postcount=1135) , please and take the "ZigZag"- Indicator, not the "High_Low_v2_ZigZag".

Hi FXcube,  
  
thanks for the indicator. I set length to 14 as for the CCI, but I do not get the last line down on the EURUSD, H1 chart like yours...  
  
What settings do you use?  
  
In backtest it looks really good, but I read in another forum that the live drawing from high to low / low to high should be very slow...may be too slow for using it with the CCI top/bottom strategy. I will test it when market opens.  
  
Thanks,  
Oliver

Hi Olarion1975  
  
Oh, sorry, have take a look again in my directory, this blue (ZigZag) is the right indicator (and not the red one "High_Low_v2_ziZag") .

Thank you Forexcube, I will have a look too when the market opens.  
  
And thanks for the nice comment about my nickname, I am a collector of old movies since many years and so when I first encountered FF I automatically chose a movie character ( like in my many other film forums ), without thinking much about forum status or long-term commitment. Now since trading has become one of my main pursuits I just kept it, no need to prove anything to anyone.  
  
The zigzag might be helpful, I also like to keep it simple and use MTF support and resistance levls, e.g. _price action candles_ showing rejection or confirmation of these levels. More possible when I have the opportunity to post charts again.  
  
  
Best regards,

May be one or another could use it in some form or another.  
  
ToR_1.02.mq4   
by Tom Balfe  
This indicator shows you whether a pair is trending or ranging. For trending markets use moving averages and for ranging market use oscillators. It shows ADX values for multiple timeframes to help you decide which trading technique to use. Sometimes you'll see short-term trends against the H4 and D1 trend. It's up to you whether you trade in a ranging market. It seems to Tom Balfe that trading with the long-term trend is best. Having said that, the reason why Tom Balfe made this indicator is to let the trader decide at a glance what to do, or even to do nothing. Staying out of a market is a position too.   
See the code at MetaEditor, please.  
  
TA_1.14c.mq4  
by Tom Balfe.  
This indicator helps you trade by giving you two signals on multiple timeframes. It bases it's recommendations on RSI and stochastics.   
  
Kindest regards

Thank you Forexcube, I will try it next week. The multi-timeframe reading can be very good ( with some of them ), but with most of them I found that CPU is on overload..... so I have been a bit wary of them, especially as I use MT4 only for charting and place my trades on [Oanda](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile").  
  
As this has already been posted numerous times on other forums, I might as well recommend H. Liu`s currency strenght meter, simple but quite good as it was modified for less intense computer power.  
  
Another kind of meter can be found in lawgirl´s thread, her MTF indicator basically measures RSI set to 3 on multiple timeframes. I have found this to be often even more accurate and real-time as those numbered or " arrow only " indicators.  
  
I will have time tomorrow and next week to post charts and examples what I was trying to say.  
  
A BIG thank you !

The Emergence of a Trend and when does a Range-Bound come up?  
  
TCT has his own indicators. We can also use Bollinger bands, where we can confidently trade the bounce of the BB lines. There is a well known strategy by J.Ross, which can be downloaded at the attachment.  
  
Internet are full of other helpful indicators.  
  
e.g., see here, please:

Hi Pilli  
  
A group of interesting traders has ask me if I could make more an opening communication chat where all interested traders could take part immediately consecutive in my trading activities. This event could be that it'll produce costs. May be that I will do something when it will not alone produce costs but also save expenses. Actual it seems that I'm in a conference with a London group who have specializes in the fundamental analyses and in trading the news. This could be the perfect complement to what I'm doing. The pilot study is going on currently and if all being well and all will coming up to expectations, ...so it could be that in January 2011 it will be break the first ground.  
  
Kindest regards  
FXcube

I take the risk over with an Enter Short at 0.9845   
  
Target 0.7880  
  
  
If market price will go further upside make some enter short again over 1.0  
and would hedging at H4 in the meantime.  
  
H4-Chart:  
H4 shows trade examples.  
(NT means "No Trade", because RSI(14) is rising up , so the EMA Lines, too (look at #[**1150**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4238143&postcount=1150) , please) - see also the "wellxAMA"-Indicator).

Observe caution! At Weekly market price could break out the resistance lines, so look at H4 (see #[**1152**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4238219&postcount=1152), please) for hedging ones - it could be useful for you to do it.

Hi porfirio  
  
Thank you for your excellent charts! and...thanks for your interpretation.   
  
Is your trading strategy more short term based? Have you also take a look at Weekly and Monthly chart? That may very well be that higher charts encourage your short frame analyses. If so then the power of your arguments are getting more stronger. Do you think it's more range or more trending time?  
  
Kindest regards  
FXcube

USDCHF, Daily, 2010 December 13  
USDCHF, H4, 2010 December 13  
USDCHF, H1, 2010 December 13  
  
Self-explanatory!  
  
Conclusion:  
Trade the range at lower timeframes and the breakout at higher ones!![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
Daily is forming a triangle. Prices has touched the H4 lower line of BB. H4 and H1 CCI(14) are at the bottom. Set stop loss below the daily triangle, due to the possibility of a breakout downside. If so you have then at first take a look at the range (orange bottom line).  
  
If the market price hold at 0.97/0.96 daily positive divergence might be intact,...a caused occasion for buying more longs.  
  
Hope it helps!  
  
Kindest regards

Good morning Forexcube,  
  
I am still going through the thread and sorting out possible questions. I like the CCI reaction very much, I was a RSI " fan " before.....  
  
Your example : to buy @ 09:19 5 ( ! ) Lots eurusd and close it barely 20 pips later is high risk.  
  
a) this is whipsaw time for me, a very good trader told me to wait for the typical end of major early move at around 10:00 GMT and then trade the correction. An alternative is to trade 1 hr before LO open, especially the last 5 min to the full hour is good.  
  
b) where are the stops ?  
  
c) eurusd has been in a risky mess, why not trade other pairs. Too many traders focusing on their 15 min chart on eu or gu and expect to make 100 pips every day.  
  
My 2 cents, more questions/comments later.....  
  
  
  
  
_______________

EURUSD, M5, 2010 December 14  
  
You can't go in the market with enter short if the market goes up!  
It was a very stromg upward movement (till DR1 1.3484).  
  
So the enter long orders at 8:40 and 8:50 wasn't overly clever! - yep,...really unprofessional!  
  
CCI(14) has showing a top but the EMA Lines were going stright away deep upward.  
  
  
The probability are extremely great when in a volatile market environment the next Pivotal Point (here DR1 at 1.3484) could be reached.

Compensate and counterbalance all open high lot size trades if market will give you the chance.  
  
So make up your market analyses at a lot of different currency pairs and time frames. There's no harm of you need 2 or 3 days for that! It's now your job to do it!

Set a time limit when you would have change all high sized loss order in a win. In two day? ,... may be in 1 week?,...by no later than 1 month?...  
  
Okay you didn't know it in detail and the most part of the contracts should be dependend at the market environment. But you have taken your chart analyses and on the basis of your analyses you should come to a rating.

see Step 1.  
  
Don't wait that you could make any more profit when you let the trader further run in the win. It's not your task at the moment by minimizing the big lots of open orders.

Minimize the loss (total amount) of the open trades.  
see #[**1173**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4242507&postcount=1173), #[**1167**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4241572&postcount=1167), please.

Repeat Step 1 and Step 2 so often you can do.  
  
Example:   
see, #[**1176**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4242627&postcount=1176) and #[**1177**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4242640&postcount=1177), please.

Don't over-react.   
  
You can close the first order AUDCAD 49.56 at #[**1177**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4242640&postcount=1177).  
  
But this is only one 0.5 lot size. You've make your market analyses before. So no need to close it down. Let it run. Your account deposit looks much better now (-18'879.50$) compared with this one in the morning, see #[**1167**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4241572&postcount=1167), please (-36'329.51$). Isn't it?  
  
...and be aware that the opened 6 Lot EURUSD and the 8.5 Lot USDCHF contracts are too much only for one single currency-pair. Look that you can make it smaller in the next days, may be today. (See also critical reflexions, #[**1180**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4242731&postcount=1180)).

Step 7 - Critical Reflexions.  
  
E.G.   
Weren't it too risky to close these high 24 Lot Hedging trades?  
  
H4 was showing a divergence at the Pivotal DR1 1.3475.  
  
Probabilities for a turn down seems to be great at that time by monitoring the M1/M5.

Step 3 - Make Market Analyses so often if it's necessary!  
Step 4 - Setting time level  
  
E.G. EURUSD, Daily, 2010 December 14  
  
If the daily candle will shape into a shooting star at NY Close Time might be that chances are greater that the open high lot sizes at EURUSD and the correlated currency pair USDCHF could run the next days in the win zone without of hedging.

May be wait or trade the H1/H4 till the trend will become clearer.  
  
Wish you success and happiness!

GBPCHF, H4, 2010 December 16  
  
GC has forming a H4 divergence, and weekly the same. If support line (weekly) hold then the are excellent aspects for some more enter longs.  
  
Enter Long at 1.5050

Market Tip  
  
In Forex we don't have the burdon of financial statements by itself. However, we can still analyze a currency's condition (strength or weakness) based on a number of factors. Combined, these give us a better indication of a particular trade's worthiness.   
  
Forex Market isn't predictable - there are only different weighted pro and cons - so future market price should be more a matter of conjecture), you should be familiar with a minimum:   
  
(1) The currency's behavioral characteristics, say how much does it move (hourly?, daily?, weekly?), does it moves abruptly?, graduelly?, does it spike?;  
(2) the economies of the currency pairs (strong?, weak?, budget deficits or surplius?);   
(3) the general market trend (up, still, down);   
(4) where the current market price is relative to today's movement, yesterday's-, last week's-, last month's-;   
(5) how do the microcharts (M1, M5, M15, M30, H1) relates to the macro- (4h, daily, weekly, monthly); and so on.  
(6) Try to find out the currency-pairs at all hazards which could have better option for making a profit.  
  
Market Tip to connoted as trade examples - these are trades how I would like to realize it in the given market situation so to say a display windows of some of my trades.  
  
Kindest Regards  
FXcube

Might be not the worst idea to trade the EURUSD down and contrary some longs at H4 the positive divergence GBPJPY north, (but daily 1.2968 could be possible) - ceteris paribus (without any "speculation whipsaws").

For higher likelihood of success try to align market action with price action.

Trade Example:  
Range Bound Trading at M5  
Trading the Tops and Bottoms at CCI(14) in conjungtion with the upper and lower line of Bollinger Band (BB)  
  
Could be excellent in nights like this one. Why? For the simple reason that the EMA10/20 lines are going parallel!

Might be it could be better today to trade the CCI(14) Tops and Bottoms at M1/M5 with a look at higher timeframes (M15/M30/H4) and the Daily Pivotal Points.

Divergence at M5 just now.  
  
May be good time for an Enter with some Shorts and trading the CCI(14) Tops and Bottoms at M1/M5.

That's one simple strategy for adding pips.  
  
It's easy, simple, but fast, so it's need a specific reaction time.

When I trade the M1 I always take a look at H4, too.  
  
Here you see that at H4 prices could go up till ~1.3365

So if you trade M1, you have to take a look at M5, M15, M30, H1, H4, Daily, the Pivotals and sometimes the Fibonaccis.  
  
M1 Trading isn't a pleasure! You have to make much work before you go at M1 in the market.  
  
That's fact!  
  
You need concentrated attention.   
  
I wish you success and happiness!  
  
Kindest regards

EURUSD, M15, 2010 December 16  
  
..and if you take a look at M15 so here are the analyses.  
  
If you decide on M1 trading so you've to look at M15 and working out the pros and cons.  
  
Good chances for some Enter Short but the resistance line gives you contra. If market price will broken it further upside then hedge your shorts or go long.

EURUSD, Weekle, 2010 December 17  
  
Trading the triangle and interim the ups and downs at smaller TF's could be a favored option.

Fib has reached two times at 61.8.  
  
May be it could be a favored option to trade the range at M5 and looking for a breakout outside the weekly triangle (#[**1232**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4250837&postcount=1232)) or the daily 61.8 fib levels before going on with the trend and then coming back with the trades at the higher timeframes (Daily).  
  
If price is likely to stay within the range or breakout the range, this is where you really put speed of the market and momentum of price to good use in your analysis.  
  
With lots of speed and strong momentum, the range will likely be broken. With little speed and weak momentum the range will likely hold and continue.

p.59, #[**883**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4191500&postcount=883).  
  
  
Expert Advisor Programming "Creating Automated Trading Systems in MQL for MetaTrader 4" written by Andrew R. Young is in my room now.  
  
Criticism  
A great pity!   
It's boring written, the code only in black and white, no colours, now images, and only 199 pages. Other programming books (like some of CC++) are written with scads of images, essentially more interesting, more powerful and importantly more imaginative, but this one from Andrew R.Young is soul-destruyingly boring!,.. not worth a cent. Most of them you can read at internet free and a considerable amount more. Here was someone to take small paints to do something.  
  
What a bummer!  
  
Kindest regards

May be it's time for some Long Term Trades Enter Short.  
  
Daily is forming a triangle so set stop loss above and watch H4 for a better market entry.  
  
...and the Daily RSI(14) is ascending since 2010.09.29.

EURUSD, M1, 2010 December 21  
  
Trading the CCI(14) Tops and Bottoms at M1 and take a look if the momentum and the speed of the market change.  
  
If I would have more time in these days I would trade like this and would wait for a breakout.

USDCHF, Daily, 2010 December 21  
  
USDCHF shows a daily divergence. I take the risk over with 5 Positions of Enter Long at 0.9587.   
  
I'm not a friend about Stop Loss. If I would set one may be under the support line.  
  
Feel free to declare these trades as long term carry trades.

Hello Forexcube,  
  
thank you again for this thread, Merry Christmas to you too !  
  
( I love Zermatt ...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1))  
  
GJ, I had a look at the LFXGBP Index and I think GJ and GU are at overshoot down levels. I took a small long position today and plan on holding it probably until end of first week January, at least.  
  
All my best wishes !

Here you could have four powerful arguments for an H1 Entry-and-Exit-Trading:   
1\. Market price is moving in a range.  
2\. Prices are turning at the upper and lower band of Bollinger Band (BB)  
3\. CCI(14) Tops and Bottoms  
4\. "i-FractalsEx"

EURCHF, Monthly, 2010 December 26  
EURCHF, Daily, 2010 December 26  
  
Monthly and Daily are showing a divergence. May be you could wait at the next H4 CCI(14) Bottom (see #[**1254**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4265727&postcount=1254)) and go in with several trades or to take a look if the upper line of BB will break further up (see #[**1254**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4265727&postcount=1254)).

It's more ideal to wait for the moment to pick up and for the market to show some sort of direction before you pull the trigger.

It's simply bulls vs. bears.  
  
Daily chart are showing powerful arguments for some enter longs on a comparable basis of a monthly positive divergence.

Trading any market carries a high level of risk, and may not be suitable for all investors. The high degree of leverage can work against you as well as for you. Before deciding to invest you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with trading, and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts.

Thank's msmarple!  
  
These are some little open trades (250.-$ real account) , just now, never mind that the market price could go further down for 80-150 pips. If so it could be one more beneficial event for some additional Enter Longs.  
  
Best regards!

Forex Broker Tricks  
  
April 2, 2009 _by Hass67_  
If you are serious about starting forex trading than you should know the games youre your forex broker can play with you. Most of the small forex traders dont know these facts and are easily taken for a ride by unscrupulous forex brokers.  
Retail forex market where small traders like you and I trade forex is different than the interbank forex market. Interbank forex market is where big banks, corporations, hedge fund and other institutional investors exchange currencies. It is only open to big players.   
With the advent of internet, retail forex trading became popular. Forex brokers work as intermediaries between the retail traders and the interbank market. Forex brokers popularize retail fx trading by offering online margin accounts. But beware retail forex market is not highly regulated. Due to poor regulation forex brokers can do what they want with immunity.  
You need to know the games; a forex broker can play with you. If you dont know what games a forex broker can play with you, you will never succeed at forex trading. Understand how the broker can trick you:  
Pricing is Not Transparent: Being an OTC (Over the Counter) market, forex broker can quote prices that may not be fair but you have accept them or choose another broker. The prices that your forex broker is going to quote to you, is the price that you will get. You cannot do anything about it.  
Encouraging Leverage: Your forex broker will encourage you to use a high leverage like 100-1 or 200-1. Leverage is good when you are winning but it will wipe you out in case of a loss. Most of the retail forex traders are amateurs and dont know how to handle leverage, they expose themselves and get wiped out in the market quickly. The more you lose the more your broker will make. Dont use too high leverage.  
Trading against you: Your forex broker will most probably will be trading against you! Since, most of the retail trades are too small in size; your forex broker cannot immediately offset this position in the interbank market. This gives them the opportunity to trade against you. The more you lose, the more your broker makes.  
Practices that are unfair: Forex brokers and Casinos have the same mentality: they dont like winner. If you are winning too much, the house will be stacked against you. Your forex broker may make the execution of your trades very difficult or start denying the service to you. Your trade may not execute due to slippage. There are many games the broker will play against you so beware.

Hi londonprince  
  
Thank you for your kind words.  
  
I must unfortunately admit that I'm not a friend of forex simulators or forward and backtesting systems. I like making the trade in the reality with real money. So I can better reflect all the irregularities around the forex market. It's life in reality. When I post a demo account via my "public PC" on this thread here then exclusive of security questions.

Kindest regards

Forex Broker Scams  
  
Forex traders need to know about their forex brokers if they want to really start trading forex trading. There are many myths and scams that need to be exposed. Many retail forex traders are too simpleton to understand the games the forex brokers play with them.  
Retail forex market is new and different from forex interbank market. Forex interbank market is only open to big players like banks, corporations, hedge funds, pension funds and other institutional investors and deals with large currency transactions.  
Retail forex market was developed after the advent of the internet. Retail forex brokers offer online margin accounts to retail forex traders like you and me who are small time players in a huge market. Retail forex market is loosely regulated that lets the forex brokers play games with small forex traders.  
Know these games before you start your forex trading. The following facts can help you understand some of the games that can be played against you:**  
  
Pricing is Not Transparent**: Being an OTC (Over the Counter) market, forex broker can quote prices that may not be fair but you have accept them or choose another broker. The prices that your forex broker is going to quote to you, is the price that you will get. You cannot do anything about it.  
  
**Leverage** : Forex brokers let you trade forex with a high leverage like 100-1 or 200-1. Rather they will encourage you to use more leverage. Using leverage allows you to make high gains with a small price movement but it destroys you when you are on the wrong side of the market. Since most of the forex traders dont know how to trade. Giving you high leverage lets your broker gain when you lose.   
  
**Brokers trade against you** : Since most of the retail forex trades are too small in size, forex broker is not immediately able to offset this position in the interbank market. This provides them the chance to trade against you. Most of the retail traders dont know how to trade. So you lose and your broker wins.  
  
**Practices that are unfair** : Forex brokers and Casinos have the same mentality: they don’t like winners. If you are winning too much, the house will be stacked against you. Your forex broker may make the execution of your trades very difficult or start denying the service to you. Your trade may not execute due to slippage. There are many games the broker will play against you so beware.   
Forex brokers are more of a marketing machine than market makers. Forex brokers need a constant stream of new clients to keep making money since most of the new traders dont survive longer than a few months. Forex brokers spend vast sums of money on advertising to entice new traders. If you go on Google and search any forex related keyword, you will find most of the ads are by forex brokers. Forex brokers give many incentives to you to start trading.  
  
Forex brokers want you to trade more. They use many methods as incentives to make you do that. One of the methods is to hold a Forex Trading Contest by announcing cash prizes of $2000, $1000 and $500 for the top three. In order to win, many small traders get wiped out losing their money. This is just a trick forex brokers use to make you trade more. The more you trade, the more money your broker makes. This trick is similar to a lottery.  
  
Forex brokers are free to offer any price to their clients. Most of the brokers get price quotes from the interbank market with a 1 pip or even lower spread. To this pip spread they add 2 or 3 or even more pips as the price quote to their clients. Just imagine by acting only as middlemen between the interbank market and retail forex trader, forex brokers make risk free profits of 3 to 4 pips on a round trip trade.  
There is a practice used by forex brokers called Price Shading. For example, if the broker is convinced that Euro is on an uptrend and its price is going to rise, the broker will shade his price quote slightly higher to take advantage of the likely increase in Euro price. One of the classic tricks used by many brokers is to trip stop losses with a single momentary blip. Brokers have all the information about stop losses placed by their clients. So, if he finds many stop losses at a certain level, there will be a momentary spike in the price feed that will trip most of the stop losses.  
  
You can’t do anything. It was a momentary spike, so small that it only tripped the stop losses. You can never complain, your broker will always say there was sudden big transaction in the interbank market or his price feed is faster and better in reflecting the interbank rates.

Silver, Weekly, 2010 December 27  
  
Silver's weekly put into shape a divergence.  
  
Look at the daily middle line of BB if it'll broken in the next days downside, so then a break at the Zero Line of CCI(14) as well.  
  
If not,..., hedge at H4.

EURUSD, Monthly, 201 December 29  
  
Self-explenatory.  
  
Market seems to be in a consolidating phase.   
  
So Range Bound Trading is my favorable trading style at the moment, may be to trade the breakouts at H1/H4 if something will really happen in the next days. I don't know.

USDCHF, H4, 2010 December 30  
USDCHF, M15, 2010 December 30  
  
CCI(14) Tops and Bottom.  
  
Trade the USDCHF at different timeframes at one time.  
  
H4 is showing a divergence, what's more H1 (see #[**1289**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4273766&postcount=1289), please).  
  
Weekly bar has touched the DS2 at 0.94133.  
  
Might be a good chance for some enter longs at H4 around 0.9425 and hedge the downside at M30 and trade some M15 and H1 (see #[**1289**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4273766&postcount=1289), please) candles in between.

EURUSD H1, H4 make a divergence. Pivotal DR1 1.3277 is reached.  
  
May be good chance for some enter shorts.

This could be an example how you can trust in your trades and for advanced level traders if they trust at theirselves,... why not go in with higher risk with one of these smaller accounts.

Hi TenFX  
  
The last example isn't something for traders at beginner levels. Really not!  
  
Market prices were going at Pivotal Points and M1 and M5 was at the CCI(14) high. Often it's quite simple like this. The rest is grit and by experience. Often things come out so simple.  
  
Before you intend to take this high risk be updated that you have make enough profit at your accounts, may be then it's better time to copy this high risk trading style.  
  
May be I can invite you to read some examples referenced at #1.   
  
The most part I trade extremely conservative.  
  
Kindest regards  
FXcube

Well ive been thinking about you and looking a lot at the CCI divergence while i trade and going back seeing how it would work out, and it would seem it has a lot to it. I think the statements you post is possibly your best statements, but regardless you are one or the most honest and kind traders i have talked to here on FF. At the good times price bounces between my own signals and CCI divergence.   
  
I am using, and have been for quite some time now envelopes, or rather i got to it in a strange fashion, i calcultated them through trial and error from MAs. Well anyway, how is your experience with the CCI divergence on M1?  
  
I will post my template here so you can have a look if you like. Dashed lines are signals, depending on the volumes. I am sure you can see pretty much what they do, and why there is one that is thicker then the other two.  
  
I use it on E/U M1.

Hi yaed  
  
Thank you for this template. If you could post some examples here in future we can discuss for all practical purposes. Think about it.   
  
_"...how is your experience with the CCI divergence on M1?"_  
The lower the timeframe the weaker the arguments. In a strong uptrend it's better to go at M1 with the maintrend, even if M1 would show a negative divergence; (...and may be think at #[**2**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3928225&postcount=2), #[**4**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3928227&postcount=4), please).  
  
Happy New Year!

H4 is showing a divergence. Why not taking the risk over with an Enter Long at the CCI(14) Bottom around 1.5380 yet?  
  
Target: 1.5485 (Daily Pivot at 1.5501)

Four arguments (+) for an H4 Enter Long?  
  
Monthly is showing a divergence (+) and a CCI(14) Bottom (+) and price is at the lower line of BB (+).  
  
...or/and as a Carry Trade long time (+).  
  
Enter Long at 0.9335  
  
...and be aware if the EURUSD will coming upwards then it might be better to hedge the negative correlated currency pair USDCHF downwards or take some EU Longs for counterbalancing the account.

EURUSD, Daily, 2011 January 05  
  
We've got hidden bearish divergence. This occurs when price makes a lower high (LH), but the oscillator is making a higher high (HH). By now you've probably guessed that this occurs in a downtrend. When you see hidden bearish divergence, chances are that the pair will continue to shoot lower and continue the downtrend.   
  
Don't forget that the market is in a sideway movement and has reached the upper line of the range.  
  
Fib:  
Today the market price has touched the 38.2 level.  
  
May be good chances for several shorts at lower time frames (H1/H4) and trade the M5/M15/M30 now and then (e.g. #[**1313**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4286970&postcount=1313)).  
  
Wish all of you success and happiness!

EURUSD, M5, 2011 January 06  
  
When the market is more in a slighty downward (or upward) channel, may be it's also a good time for M1/M5 CCI(14) Tops & Bottom Trading and wait for a bigger breakout.  
  
S1 1.3074 (and may be S2 1.2998) isn't reached just now.   
  
It's not the best time to trade at the moment the higher time frames, I think.  
  
Kindest regards

Trading the CCI(14) Tops & Bottoms Concept at H1 with "Ger30Mar11" is like picking peanuts. I like it!

EURUSD, H4, 2011 January 06  
  
Looks like a divergence at H4, isn't it?   
  
Be careful!   
Market players seems to become more nervous! If so then the market could falling in an uncontrollable situation meanwhile.  
  
I would prefere to trade the H4 Enter Long with M5/M15, so trades could react fastly and early enough with the market volatility.

Hi mate!  
your system looks very easy and very effective. I'm going to learn about it more and trade the TCT.  
Just a question. What do you think about 15M TF trading with H4 Murray M. Lines setting? Isn't H4 too much for 15M?  
I see H1 Murray Math are very often pretty close to trade between them.  
  
Btw, the TCT entry signals (I've made some backtesting) are the best I've seen ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1).  
  
I usualy don't have a problem to recognize where the price is going but my entries suck as much as you can imagine. That is why I am still looking for a system which will fit me at the best level.  
  
Thank you.

Hello Forexcube  
Bidding on your system for almost a month, he began to explore and understand its principles only recently. Positively, I understand why you're trading without a stop-loss  
  
<http://savepic.ru/2150896.png> I had some questions as you have time to open positions on the M1 chart?   
At a more senior taymfrey paying attention?   
Does the position of prices relative to ema and the public?  
  
\------------------  
Hello Forexcube   
Торгую по вашей системе уже почти месяц , начал осваивать и понимать ее принципы только недавно. Отзывы положительные , я понял почему вы ведете торговлю без стоп-лосс   
У меня появилось несколько вопросов , Как вы успеваете открывать позиции на М1 графике ?  
На какой более старший таймфрей обращаете внимание ?   
Имеет ли значение положение цены относительно EMA и каких ?

Gregory operate without SL is easy and you can get a few pips in m1 ... but how difficult is to get out ... should take the losses and have much experience (as forexcube).  
practice a lot before entering real without SL.  
(I do not advise it)  
I do in the demo with good results (cci 14) ... I would never do in real,must have nerves of steel, few people would have

And ive been thinking about it ever since. To judge from your statements you dont need any modification to your understanding of price, im only at 70-85% accuracy, so i would not want your better judgement clouded by my comparably fuzzy logic. At the moment, im working on taking price apart bit by bit and analyzing its every move, every nook and cranny, every possibility and impossibility. It was still only a couple of months since i started being profitable, so i cannot say i have your track record and confidence behind me. Anyway, remember to relax this weekend and stop thinking about trading for a while.  
  
There is another matter of interest relating to this. Consider the fate of this thread:  
  
[http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...81#post4297681](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=4297681#post4297681)  
  
Consider this: Given a set of circumstances A, the outcome B is given. I am not sure why 155 posts was removed from that thread, but i think its important to note that it was. Consider also much of my trades, and yours as well although you dont utilize the same visualisation aid (indicators) is similiar to how 4qx traded, see where i am going with this? Given a set of circumstances A, the outcome B is given.

Hello porfirio ,  
Yes restraint is necessary to have when trading Cell Trading, not just wait for drawdown and properly close the warrant.   
Now trading at M5 taymfree, left a couple of questions.   
At a more senior taymfrey better pay attention to?   
Does the position of price in relation to EMA and the public?   
Does the position indicator rsi at the entrance to the market +, -100, or you can open the position when the rsi to be near 0, and cci near the level of 200 or more?  
Hello **Forexcube** , I hope you at this time to answer my questions  
\--------  
Да выдержку надо иметь при торговле по Cell Trading , не только выжидать на просадках но и правильно закрывать ордера.  
Сейчас торгую на M5 таймфрее , осталось пару вопросов.   
На какой более старший таймфрей лучше обращать внимание ?  
Имеет ли значение положение цены относительно EMA и каких ?  
Имеет ли значение положение индикатора rsi при входе в рынок +,-100 или можно открывать позиции когда rsi находиться вблизи 0 , а cci возле уровня 200 и более ?   
Привет **Forexcube** , Я надеюсь вы в этот раз ответите на мои вопросы

Long Term Carry Trade  
Trading the Majors "Euro Dollar & "Dollar Swissi"  
with regards to their nature; "Correlation" (Weekly/Monthly) (see #[**1344**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4300619&postcount=1344), please) and the "Currency Index"(see #[**1343**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4300607&postcount=1343) ,please)  
  
I think with these two majors you can make money without waiting if price stayed exactly the same for long periods of time.  
  
Refresher  
A carry trade involves borrowing or selling a financial instrument with a low interest rate, then using it to purchase a financial instrument with a higher interest rate. While you are paying the low interest rate on the financial instrument you borrowed/sold, you are collecting higher interest on the financial instrument you purchased. Thus your profit is the money you collect from the interest rate differential.

HI Forexcube thanks for your reply, I have been going thru thr examples at #1 and read thru the Inside bar posts, I should say your method is quite simple, and can be very productive. I have been able to perform 2 trades today practicing your system.  
  
I have traded long on the GBPUSD twice with profit on the H1 with the CCI at Tops last week friday I did a short also using RSI  
  
Today I have Traded 2 Longs on the GBPUSD with CCI at bottom   
First trade I did not wait for RSI but RSI eventually crossed over  
  
I took 20pips profit before a minor retracement  
  
Second trade on the bounce of the retracement, I closed trade prematurely but made a nice 14pips profit.  
  
Now i want to practice using the Pivot lines, in making my trades more profitable.  
  
Sorry i havnt figured out how to uplaod the charts.

****Daily Report: Euro Remains Pressured ahead of Bond Auctions****  
  
Euro remains broadly pressured in Asian session today as markets are cautious ahead of peripheral government bond auctions this week. In particular, Portugal, which's widely considered to be the most likely country to seek bailout after Greece and Ireland, will sell as much as EUR 1.25b debts this week. Spain and Italy will also have respective bond auctions too. Technically, Euro is generally weak against other major currencies. We're favoring more downside in EUR/USD through 1.29 and EUR/GBP is expected to continue its decline towards 0.8 psychological level again. EUR/CHF and EUR/AUD are both expected to make new record lows sooner or later.

Forexcube can you elaborate on how you would implement your #1342 ?  
Buy them in two pairs to decrease the risk somewhat?  
I was thinking first to do something like this:<http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=95721>.  
Some research is needed first because I intend to hold on to a carry trade possible for years.The only idea I currently willing to load the boat with is the norwegian krone against the swissie. Thank you Bart

Hi drowningman  
  
Nice link. Thank you.   
  
Topic: Carry Trades  
I would invest 3/10 of all my intented trades of these two currency pairs last Monday (#[**1342**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4300603&postcount=1342)).  
Long USDCHF ~ 0,965  
Long EURUSD ~ 1.2915   
  
  
...and would invest 2/10 more if prices would go further down (e.g. EURUSD 1.25) and hold 5/10 in reserve (e.g. USDCHF 0.9/0.87).   
  
Ratio EURUSD/USDCHF: 1.0 / 1.5  
  
On the meantime I would hedge all downs at H4 and Daily separately at 1/1 or 1/2 (say 1 carry part/two hedging parts), till 1/5.  
  
Kindest regards

Hi drowningman  
  
Time slot  
If you intend to hold these carry trades over years may be you've to make another kind of analyse.

Time out?  
  
At the moment I stay more at the sideline with the most part of my longer term trades and wait.  
  
It's not the best time for going on at higher time frames (Daily, Weekly) in the most part of my analysed currencies. There are much Pros and Cons by comparison the different timeframes and vis-à-vis the market environment several weeks ago. May be I have to stay at the sideline a little longer.   
  
By any chance may be I'll intend to pass the time by trading some M5/M15/M30 or H1 if vola and momentum will getting stronger.  
  
Kindest regards

I take the risk over with some enter longs at 0.9860  
  
If the weekly resistance from 2010.04.18 at 0.9930 will be definitely broken down then it might be better to go out of this trade. So let's see next friday what kind of candle will forming out. The Bollinger Band lines (weekly chart) gives a simple orientation. Trades (weekly chart) could be hold till the middle line of BB.

EURUSD, M15, 2011 January 13  
EURUSD, M5, 2011 January 13  
  
Market Tip  
  
Pivot Point at DR2 is reached and the CCI(14) M15 is showing a divergence (so H4).  
  
Take the risk over with some positions:  
  
Enter Short at 1.3265 and at 1.3276  
  
Be aware: The Euro can move up till 1.350, if the momentum and the vola could be strong enough, ...and don't forget: tomorrow is Friday. Could be that these positions would run at the earliest next week in the win.

Hello **Forexcube**  
Why did you decide what position to sell on the eur / usd will justify the risk?  
The economic situation in Europe is improving, and many analysts predict a toast.  
  
By the way, I too was led by a divergence in the 4h chart, and was opened on 5 minute,  
Ended up not very

Hello **Forexcube**  
Почему вы решили что позиции на sell по eur/usd оправдают риск ?  
Экономическое положение Европы улучшается и многие аналитики прогнозируют рост.   
  
Кстати я тоже повелся на дивергенцию на 4ч графике , и открылся по 5 минуткам,  
Закончилось все не очень 

Iron discipline and what emotions

Hi Gregory-1991  
  
I make my trading decision afterwards I have made a Multiple Time Frame Analyse. Before I don't know which time frame I prefere for the market orders. The next one is I don't like to trade with a stop loss. Time Cell Trading is a trading concept which you can trade fast, simple and efficient at low level with stop loss and at an advanced level with or without any stop losses. The rest is Money- & Risk-Management. The last 25'000.-$ account had doubled within 10 days. If I have double an account I close it and open the next Account, due to the fact that I don't trade with a stop loss. My target is making 5-10 accounts net doubling per year. It could be that under some extreme volatile market environment over several days the complete deposit could been loosen, may be two or three times per year.   
  
Trading without stop loss is the preferred concept to my trading personality how to trade the market and how to multiply the profit. When I post Market Tips (see introduction at p.1, #1, please) here on this thread then it's in the most part of time without any stop loss filter. I have to hedge these orders several times in between times when the price would run in the counterpart direction.  
  
Hope it helps  
  
Kindest regards  
FXcube

Hi Gregory  
  
"The economic situation in Europe..." that's sound like some fundamental data. I 'm a rank before a technical trader with a look at some fundamentals.   
  
"...and many analysts predict..."   
Here I have only to say that I'm not the crowd. Sorry, I preferre to built up my critical mind on myself and trade the currencies with my own analyses and not through other ones (like investment bankers, economic leaders...). I don't search the flock of sheep and I like to observe the market interline.  
  
Kindest regards  
FXcube

Watch out!  
  
...if you see results at investment bankers or other investment institutional like this.  
  
So you can really hide a great loss in your profit sheet. This is WINDOW DRESSING!  
  
These are only some Ger30Mar11 trades.  
  
But  
Today Ger30Mar11, 2011 January 13: H 7093 L 7045, max. 48 points difference (not much!).

It s pretty accurate using the divergence concept, I have been using it to trade 1min chart, by reading both 1min and 5min chart's cci, also adding a stochastic to find a entry point. Again, thx for ur education.  
  
keep them coming.

Hey Cube  
  
  
The problem with CCI divergence i can see, is that it misses out on one candle, since i need to see a move towards the 0. Divergence is still a pretty nifty thing, but i have discovered it can be combined with setting a certain limit as to where price is very likely to continue do drop/climb if the CCI gets closer to 0.  
  
Have you had any experience in such things, setting a limit in CCI as to where price will come home to MAs that is?  
  
Here let me show you what i mean...   
  
So red lines would for instance be nice places for shorts, based on a drop below the 140 line at the period 14, weighted close CCI. Have you tried anything like that?

Hi Forexcube,  
  
Still following your thread with much interest.  
I have 2 quick questions though.  
  
Did you (and if so, why?) ditch the Murray Math indicator from your trading decisions?  
  
And the last question is more out of pure interest, why do you keep restarting new demo accounts instead of running 1 or 2 demo accounts for a longer period? Having an account that has 6+ months of trading has so much more impact as a trading record than 10+ accounts that run for a short period of time. Just wondering about that.  
  
Is it possible to get in touch, I might have something interesting.  
  
Kind regards,

Hi Yaed  
  
No. If you intend to test it then post your result here at board, please!  
  
If you have time you could read the following article about Woodie's CCI chart:  
[**CCI Manual**](http://www.earnforex.com/forex-e-books/advanced-forex-trading/cci_manual.pdf) — by James L. O'Connell. (Or see attachment, please).  
  
May be it give some ideas.  
  
Kindest regards

Sorry Gregory  
  
The english translation machine seems to be so bad. I don't often understand the details in your questions. That's actual the main problem. You could post further on here and I'll give you an answer.  
  
May be it's time for me to learn Russian. I don't know!

Hi Pilli  
  
No, I use it further on. Murray Math seems to be clear I thought. I won't have any problems to put it on the charts again in the future. Charts seems to be clearer the fewer things are on it.

I like to trade with Non-Stop-Loss. Two or three times a year big capital players make a turmoil at the Forex Market so that most of these non-stop-accounts will gotten pulverize. The only reason! ....Ah, anymore, the other is more a security question.

You can mail a private message at first and in the following contact I can give you an e-mail, if I can to assume good intention. After that we can call.

**Weekend Analysis: A Path To Forex Profits**  
  
****by Selwyn Gishen** ([Contact Author](http://www.investopedia.com/contact.aspx?ContentType=A&Subject=Investopedia%20Contact%20Form&ContentID=5687) | [Biography](http://www.investopedia.com/contributors/default.aspx?id=216))**  
There are three basic reasons for doing a weekend analysis. The first reason is that you want to establish a "big picture" view of a particular market in which you are interested. Doing this analysis over the weekend, when the markets are closed, is helpful because such an analysis can be made when the markets are not in dynamic flux and, therefore, you don't need to react to situations as they are unfolding.  
  
Secondly, the analysis will help you to set up your trading plans for the coming week, which in turn will help you to decide what trading plans you might want to implement. Remember, shooting from the hip can leave a hole in your pocket! Weekend analysis should be more akin to an architect preparing a blue print from which he will take the steps, based on his blue print, to construct the different aspects of the building he's designed.  
  
Finally, the reason for undertaking a weekend analysis is to build a routine preparation method that will help to build a trading plan in the area in which you are focusing so you can establish the necessary mindset for the upcoming week. A good analysis is how you can "psych" yourself up for the oncoming trading activity. (Check out _[9 Tricks Of the Successful Trader](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/08/successful-trader-traits.asp)_ for more.)  
  
**Preparing for the Week  
**Since this is a [forex](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forex.asp) article, the emphasis is on the necessary preparation for trading forex during the coming week. But the preparatory steps can also be used and are helpful if you trade stocks, bonds or [commodities](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commodity.asp). It's important to remember that none of the markets are actually separate, or trade in a vacuum. All the markets are interdependent, so that in a global economy the purchase of bonds, equities, goods and services all have an effect on the levels of supply and demand for currencies. Therefore, the price levels of the various currencies will vary when money flows around the world as [investment](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/10/weekend-analysis.asp?partner=fxweekly1#) searches for the highest and safest yields. (For a background, see our _[Forex Tutorial](http://www.investopedia.com/university/forexmarket/)_.)  
  
**Understand the Drivers**  
The art of successful trading is partly due to an understanding of the current relationships between markets and the reasons that these relationships exist. It is important to understand the causative factors that are in play at the moment. Remember, though, that these relationships can and do change over time. Once you have a grasp on the existing relationships, then a study of price charts and the statements of the pundits, insiders, brokers and news [services](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/10/weekend-analysis.asp?partner=fxweekly1#) can be either reinforcing or ignored depending on your particular reading of the circumstances.  
  
For example, a stock market recovery could be explained by investors who are anticipating an economic recovery. These investors believe that companies will have improved [earnings](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/10/weekend-analysis.asp?partner=fxweekly1#) and, therefore, greater valuations in the future. Hence they believe that now is a good time to buy! Or it can be that speculation, based on a flood of [liquidity](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp), is fueling momentum and that good old greed is pushing prices higher and higher until all players are on board so that the selling can begin.  
  
A weekend analysis should be a basis for an understanding of the circumstances currently in play. These are the true [fundamentals](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundamentals.asp). Therefore the first question to ask is, why? Why are these things happening? What are the drivers behind the market actions?  
  
**Technical Drivers**  
Many technical analysts believe that patterns or certain price levels on charts can also be the drivers of trader behavior. They believe that so many traders are watching for these patterns that they become self-fulfilling prophecies. There has long been a debate, for example, whether a Fibonacci level is a number that is a measurement of some natural force or whether it is valid just because so many people watch for the number to occur and then trade accordingly. Whatever the reason, there are certain patterns and levels that will trigger trader action. (For more, see _[Can Technical Analysis Be Called A Self-Fulfilling Prophecy?](http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/selffulfillingprophecy.asp)_)  
  
**The News**  
The news also fuels actions. Traders wait for the news releases to confirm or deny their hypotheses and then enter or exit their trades. If these news releases occur at certain technical levels then they attract even more trader activity and can increase the odds of a successful trade. Not every news release is always valid for timing a trade. Those releases that occur at specific chart confluences can have a more dramatic effect on the volatility of the market and will provide better trading opportunities. (To learn more, see _[Trading On News Releases](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/05/TradingOnNews.asp)_.)  
  
**Setting Up a Trading Plan  
**By doing a weekend analysis, a trader can prepare for the coming week and, depending on the type of trading he or she likes to do, such as [scalping](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/scalping.asp) the news, or trading the five minute charts or waiting for a [swing trade](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swingtrading.asp) setup, he or she will have a blueprint to guide his trading. The old adage of "plan your trade – and trade your plan," is sage advice.  
  
**Chart the Indexes  
**It is helpful for a trader to chart the important indexes for each market on a longer time frame. This exercise can help a trader to determine relationships between markets and whether a movement in one market is inverse or in concert with the other.

As you can see in Figure 1, there is an inverse relationship between gold and the dollar. As gold goes down in price, the dollar increases and vice a versa.  
  
For example, in 2009, gold was being driven to record highs. Was this move in response to the perception that paper [money](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/10/weekend-analysis.asp?partner=fxweekly1#) was debasing so rapidly that there was a need to return to the hard metal as a store of value? Or was this the result of cheap dollars fueling a commodities boom? Or both? Could the speculators be promoting the gold hedge concept to attract dollars from Main Street into gold so that they can speculate on the momentum and then sell into the strength once gold reaches certain levels? Speculation is a game and how well it is played depends on the ability of the trader to understand the driving factors.  
  
Now that we know that gold has an inverse relationship with the dollar, we can ask ourselves what will happen if gold sells off, or what would happen to gold if the dollar appreciates? We would expect an appreciating dollar to reduce the price of gold. Could we also expect a sell off in gold to have an impact on the dollar? Probably not, because many other commodities, stocks and bonds all impact the dollar, not only gold. (Learn more in _[Using Technical Analysis In The Gold Markets](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/technical/02/071502.asp)_.)  
  
So let us then turn to the dollar index chart to try and determine if there is a potential trade set-up. In this instance we note that the dollar has traded down to a level of 75.00, which is at the 127.8 extension of the previous upswing. It is also trading at a 78% [retracement](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retracement.asp) of the swing from March, 2008 through November, 2009.  
  
This indicates a potentially strong resistance level for the dollar.  
  
[http://i.investopedia.com/inv/articl...e/Weekend2.gif](http://i.investopedia.com/inv/articles/site/Weekend2.gif) Figure 2 Source: netdania.com   
  
The dollar index should bounce off of the 78% retracement from the low of March 2008 to the high of April 2009. At this level it is worth listening closely to the pundits as to how they explain why the dollar should start increasing in value against other currencies, especially in the light of the consensus at the time that the dollar was likely to weaken against the basket of currencies due to the threat of future inflation. At these levels it is worth watching the news and listening to the experts to garner clues as to what the sentiment is. If the markets are going to turn, sentiment will start to shift in favor of the turn and a trader can capitalize on this fact. **  
  
Is There a Consensus in Other Markets?  
**By charting other instruments on the same weekly or even monthly basis, we can gain a perspective of whether or not the markets are reaching a turning point consensus. Then we can take advantage of the consensus to enter a trade in an instrument that will be affected by the turn. For example, [dollar yen](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/forex/u/usd-jpy-us-dollar-japanese-yen-currency-pair.asp) indicates an oversold position with talk in the market place that the [BOJ](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankofjapan.asp) could intervene to weaken the yen. Japanese exports are affected because of the strong yen. Without any weakening of the yen, a Japanese recovery was likely to be impaired. (Learn more in _[The U.S. Dollar And The Yen: An Interesting Partnership](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/09/japanese-yen-us-treasury-bonds.asp)_.)  
  
**Gold Chart Provides Interesting Perspective  
**The gold chart indicates that a level is being reached at which many traders could take profits. A cheap dollar has fueled a gold rally. The dollar has enabled a carry trade in gold, but at some point there will be profit taking and I would look to a [Fibonacci](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fibonaccilines.asp) level to time a sell off. (Check out _[Taking The Magic Out Of Fibonacci Numbers](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/06/fibonacci.asp)_ for more.)

Figure 3 Source: netdania.com   
  
In summary, we see that the dollar index is bouncing at two strong Fibonacci levels, while at the same time gold is trading to a 161.8 extension, which is also strong [resistance](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/resistance.asp).

Follow-up  
**Weekend Analysis: A Path To Forex Profits**  
  
To find a currency trade for the coming week, a look at whether the USDJPY indicates that there is support at around the 85 level. At the double bottom around 85.00 it would be worth placing an order in the market to go long the USDJPY with a stop at say 84.50. Since there was no sure fire way of knowing whether the USDJPY will trade lower than 84.00, one had to enter a trade with a tight [stop](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stoporder.asp) and wait and see. If you get [stopped out](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stoppedout.asp), wait for the appropriate signal on a shorter-term chart to take the trade again.  
The chart below, Figure 4, which depicts the USDJPY, is a monthly showing a [double bottom](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/doublebottom.asp). The currency was also trading down to a 161.8 extension of the wave marked with a blue line. This adds to the possibility that there would be a strong buying action of dollars against the yen at that level.

Figure 5 Source: netdania.com  
  
On the weekly chart of the USDJPY, Figure 5, we can see a [triple bottom](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/triplebottom.asp). Our analysis and radar is now heightened to a long USDJPY trade, which we can take on a shorter time frame, depending on our personal preferences. The longer-term charts are suggesting a possible bounce as the dollar strengthens, gold weakens and the dollar gains against the yen.  
  
[http://i.investopedia.com/inv/articl...e/Weekend6.gif](http://i.investopedia.com/inv/articles/site/Weekend6.gif)   
Figure 6   
  
A trade could have been taken on the four-hour chart. In this case there is a 400 [pip](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pip.asp) move to the upside. This was a high odds trade and easy to detect. Not every trade is so obvious! If the move has already occurred, then the question is whether to chase the trade or not. Of course there are trading systems that buy on pullbacks into the trend and so on. Each trader has to determine his own methodology and test it over a period of time to determine the expectancy of the system. Consistency is what counts. (To learn more, read _[Devising A Medium-Term Forex Trading System](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/05/060205.asp)_.)  
  
**To Trade or Not to Trade  
**There is a much higher chance of a successful trade if one can find turning points on the longer time frames, then switch down to a shorter frame to fine-tune an entry. The first trade can be at the exact Fibonacci level or double bottom as indicated on the longer term chart, and if this fails then a second opportunity will often occur on a pullback or test of the support level.  
  
Look for the low hanging fruit and be patient. Patience, discipline and preparation will set you apart from traders who simply trade on the fly without any preparation.

Is there a buy-and-hold strategy in forex, or is the only way to make [money](http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/09/buy-hold-forex-trading.asp?partner=fxweekly1#) by trading?    
  
Typically there are different ways to trade in most markets. Traders have been classified into three groups, primarily based on the time frame they prefer to trade. For simplicity, we can label these three groups as [day traders](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/daytrader.asp), [swing traders](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swingtrading.asp) and [position traders](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/positiontrader.asp). Some people consider a position's trade or [buy-and-hold](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buyandhold.asp) strategy as an [investment](http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/09/buy-hold-forex-trading.asp?partner=fxweekly1#), but in reality it is just a long term trade.  

  
Nevertheless, in the [forex market](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/forex/f/forex-market.asp), one can hold a position for as long as a few minutes to a few or more years. Depending on the goals of the trader, one can take a position based on the fundamental economic trends in one country versus another. For example, a long-term trade in the forex market, or a buy and hold position, if one prefers that term, would have been good for someone who had sold dollars to buy [euros](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/euro.asp) back in the early 2000's and then held on to that position for a few years. Suppose an American buys shares in a company in Europe, they will have pay for those shares in euros, thus there is a requirement to convert dollars into euros. Not only is the American speculating on the growth of the European company, but also on the appreciation of the euro against the dollar. In this example, the American may have benefited from an appreciating value of the shares that he or she bought, but also benefit from an appreciating currency. Of course, in the converse, had someone in Europe bought shares in a company like **General Motors** (NYSE:[GM](http://community.investopedia.com/stocks/gm)), they would have had to pay for those shares in dollars but would have lost value in both the shares and the currency during the same time period.  
  
If one wants to buy and hold a currency, one would possibly sell a currency that pays a low [interest rate](http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/09/buy-hold-forex-trading.asp?partner=fxweekly1#), such as the yen and buy a currency that pays a high interest rate, such as the Australian dollar. This would be considered a [carry trade](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currencycarrytrade.asp), where the trader will earn the interest differential between the two currencies. While he knows how much interest he will receive, he does not know how the two currencies will continue to perform against each other.  
  
Most of the Forex traders though, tend to be short term traders, constantly timing the market swings in the hope of profiting from doing so. (For more, see [_Forex Tutorial: The Forex Market_](http://www.investopedia.com/university/forexmarket/).)

****9 Tricks Of The Successful Trader** **  
  
****by Selwyn Gishen** ([Contact Author](http://www.investopedia.com/contact.aspx?ContentType=A&Subject=Investopedia%20Contact%20Form&ContentID=4606) | [Biography](http://www.investopedia.com/contributors/default.aspx?id=216))**  
For all of its numbers, charts and ratios, trading is more art than science. Just as in artistic endeavors, there is talent involved, but talent will only take you so far. The best traders hone their skills through practice and discipline. They perform self analysis to see what drives their trades and learn how to keep fear and greed out of the equation. In this article we'll look at nine steps a novice trader can use to perfect his or her craft; for the experts out there, you might just find some tips that will help you make smarter, more profitable trades, too.   
  
**Step 1.** _Define your goals and then choose a style of trading that is compatible with those goals. Be sure your personality is a match for the style of trading you choose.  
_  
Before you set out on any journey, it is imperative that you have some idea of where your destination is and how you will get there. Consequently, it is imperative that you have clear goals in mind as to what you would like to achieve; you then have to be sure that your trading method is capable of achieving these goals. Each type of trading style requires a different approach and each style has a different risk profile, which requires a different attitude and approach to trade successfully. For example, if you cannot stomach going to sleep with an open [position](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/position.asp) in the market then you might consider day trading. On the other hand, if you have [funds](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/08/successful-trader-traits.asp#) that you think will benefit from the appreciation of a trade over a period of some months, then a [position trader](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/positiontrader.asp) is what you want to consider becoming. But no matter what style of trading you choose, be sure that your personality fits the style of trading you undertake. A personality mismatch will lead to stress and certain losses. (For more, see _[Invest With A Thesis](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/07/investing_thesis.asp)_.)  
  
**Step 2.** _Choose a broker with whom you feel comfortable but also one who offers a trading platform that is appropriate for your style of trading._  
  
It is important to choose a [broker](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/broker.asp) who [offers](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/08/successful-trader-traits.asp#) a trading platform that will allow you to do the analysis you require. Choosing a reputable broker is of paramount importance and spending time researching the differences between brokers will be very helpful. You must know each broker's policies and how he or she goes about making a market. For example, trading in the [over-the-counter market](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp) or [spot market](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spotmarket.asp) is different from trading the exchange-driven markets. In choosing a broker, it is important to read the broker documentation. Know your broker's policies. Also make sure that your broker's trading platform is suitable for the analysis you want to do. For example, if you like to trade off of [Fibonacci numbers](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fibonaccilines.asp), be sure the broker's platform can draw Fibonacci lines. A good broker with a poor platform, or a good platform with a poor broker, can be a problem. Make sure you get the best of both. (For related reading, see _[_How To Pay Your Forex Broker_](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/08/forex-commission-spread.asp)_.)  
  
**Step 3.**_Choose a methodology and then be consistent in its application._  
  
Before you enter any market as a trader, you need to have some idea of how you will make decisions to execute your trades. You must know what information you will need in order to make the appropriate decision about whether to enter or exit a trade. Some people choose to look at the underlying [fundamentals](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundamentals.asp) of the company or [economy](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/08/successful-trader-traits.asp#), and then use a chart to determine the best time to execute the trade. Others use [technical analysis](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalanalysis.asp); as a result they will only use charts to time a trade. Remember that fundamentals drive the trend in the long term, whereas chart patterns may [offer](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/08/successful-trader-traits.asp#) trading opportunities in the short term. Whichever methodology you choose, remember to be consistent. And be sure your methodology is adaptive. Your system should keep up with the changing dynamics of a market. (For related reading, see [_What is the difference between fundamental and technical analysis_](http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/131.asp) and [_Blending Technical And Fundamental Analysis_](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/07/technical-fundamental.asp).)  
  
**Step 4.**_Choose a longer time frame for direction analysis and a shorter time frame to time entry or exit.  
  
_Many traders get confused because of conflicting information that occurs when looking at charts in different time frames. What shows up as a buying opportunity on a weekly chart could, in fact, show up as a sell signal on an intraday chart. Therefore, if you are taking your basic trading direction from a [weekly chart](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/weeklychart.asp) and using a [daily chart](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dailychart.asp) to time entry, be sure to synchronize the two. In other words, if the weekly chart is giving you a buy signal, wait until the daily chart also confirms a buy signal. Keep your timing in sync.  
  
**Step 5.** _Calculate your expectancy.  
_  
Expectancy is the formula you use to determine how reliable your system is. You should go back in time and measure all your trades that were winners versus all your trades that were losers. Then determine how profitable your winning trades were versus how much your losing trades lost.   
  
Take a look at your last 10 trades. If you haven't made actual trades yet, go back on your chart to where your system would have indicated that you should enter and exit a trade. Determine if you would have made a profit or a loss. Write these results down. Total all your winning trades and divide the answer by the number of winning trades you made. Here is the formula:  
  
**E= [1+ (W/L)] x P – 1**  
  
where:   
**  
W =** Average Winning Trade   
**L =** Average Losing Trade  
**P =** Percentage Win Ratio  
  
**Example:  
**If you made 10 trades and six of them were winning trades and four were losing trades, your percentage win ratio would be 6/10 or 60%. If your six trades made $2,400, then your average win would be $2,400/6 = $400. If your losses were $1,200, then your average loss would be $1,200/4 = $300. Apply these results to the formula and you get; E= [1+ (400/300)] x 0.6 - 1 = 0.40 or 40%. A positive 40% expectancy means that your system will return you 40 cents per dollar over the long term.   
**Step 6.**_Focus on your trades and learn to love small losses.  
_  
Once you have funded your account, the most important thing to remember is that [your money](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/08/successful-trader-traits.asp#) is at risk. Therefore, your money should not be needed for living or to pay bills etc. Consider your trading money as if it were vacation money. Once the vacation is over your money is spent. Have the same attitude toward trading. This will psychologically prepare you to accept small losses, which is key to managing your risk. By focusing on your trades and accepting small losses rather than constantly counting your equity, you will be much more successful.   
  
Secondly, only [leverage](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverage.asp) your trades to a maximum risk of 2% of your total funds. In other words, if you have $10,000 in your trading [account](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/08/successful-trader-traits.asp#), never let any trade lose more than 2% of the account value, or $200. If your [stops](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stoporder.asp) are farther away than 2% of your account, trade shorter time frames or decrease the leverage. (For further reading, see [_Leverage's Double-Edged Sword Need Not Cut Deep_](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/08/forex-leverage.asp).)  
  
**Step 7.** _Build positive feedback loops._  
  
A positive feedback loop is created as a result of a well-executed trade in accordance with your plan. When you plan a trade and then execute it well, you form a positive feedback pattern. Success breeds success, which in turn breeds confidence - especially if the trade is profitable. Even if you take a small loss but do so in accordance with a planned trade, then you will be building a positive feedback loop.  
  
**Step 8.**_Perform weekend analysis._  
  
It is always good to prepare in advance. On the weekend, when the markets are closed, study weekly charts to look for patterns or news that could affect your trade. Perhaps a pattern is making a [double top](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/doubletop.asp) and the pundits and the news are suggesting a market reversal. This is a kind of reflexivity where the pattern could be prompting the pundits while the pundits are reinforcing the pattern. Or the pundits may be telling you that the market is about to explode. Perhaps these are pundits hoping to lure you into the market so that they can sell their positions on increased [liquidity](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp). These are the kinds of actions to look for to help you formulate your upcoming trading week. In the cool light of objectivity, you will make your best plans. Wait for your setups and learn to be patient. (For information on determining what the market's telling you, read _[_Listen To The Market, Not Its Pundits_](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/09/pundits.asp)_.)  
  
If the market does not reach your point of entry, learn to sit on your hands. You might have to wait for the opportunity longer than you anticipated. If you miss a trade, remember that there will always be another. If you have patience and discipline you can become a good trader. (To learn more, see [_Patience Is A Trader’s Virtue_](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/07/patient_investor.asp).)  
  
**Step 9.**_Keep a printed record._  
  
Keeping a printed record is one of the best learning tools a trader can have. Print out a chart and list all the reasons for the trade, including the fundamentals that sway your decisions. Mark the chart with your entry and your exit points. Make any relevant comments on the chart. File this record so you can refer to it over and over again. Note the emotional reasons for taking action. Did you panic? Were you too greedy? Were you full of anxiety? Note all these feelings on your record. It is only when you can objectify your trades that you will develop the mental control and discipline to execute according to your system instead of your habits.

Well thanks. My public PC could have caught a virus, may be from someone of FF. So I have make a recover in the next days. This program makes "print scrn" and copy other things at the moment. They don't understand that I have my real accounts somewhere else but not at this public PC. (Stupid guy's!).  
That's the reason why I don't like to talk over Skype, don't make often downloads of some attachment and so on and it could be the next reason if I could decide one day to leave the FF.  
  
Kindest regards  
FXcube

Hi PhAnTi?   
  
For several weeks you have given me a link to your friend from England. Could it be that some virus transfers (e.g. "HiddenObject.Multi.Generic") was sent from him? From the timing and the appearance of the difficulties could it really be! May be it's necessarily that you e-mail me your right adress and your right name so we can discuss this topic to the end.  
  
I have now to work over 1 day to recover all my data at this public PC. What a sh*t!   
  
I'm not sure if I were willing to post this week may be the next time here again.  
  
Kindest regards  
FXcube

May be you here often that you have to close your trades before week-end.   
  
This is an example that there could be really good days sometimes where you leave your order door ajar over the week-end and take the risk over.  
  
All orders were set at Friday (or the day before) and close at Monday.

EURUSD, M1, 2011 January 19  
  
M1 Trading - Example  
  
If you trade M1 take a look at M5/M15 & H1/H4.  
  
Price has nearly reached mR2 and the Murrey Math "Overshoot Level" [+1/8].  
  
Enter short here and go out when CCI(14) is at the Bottom.  
  
This market environment has had a higher probabilitiy for making a short profit. I like to go in the market with a higher risk (higher lot sizes) but only for a few minutes. In & Out! Extremely short. That's all. Then you can wait till the next day or the day after or so. Once two times a day it's seems okay for me but even not more.  
  
Why here? Volatility has increase dramatically and the EMA Lines are getting narrower in conjunction with a round number 1.3500 and the mR2 pivotal point. All these "micro-market-events" ("MME's") might be powerful arguments.  
  
  
Be aware: You can't trade this way all the day long! Then you could lose all your money!

Hello Forexcube  
Good yield, it is a pity that trading on a demo account "as I understood"  
Why do not you open a real account?  
I do not know whether you should learn Russian, there is nothing good in the post-Soviet space was not. Besides saying the money can be all or virtually all  
Rather, I need to learn English, which I do  
  
Хорошая доходность , жаль только что торгуете на демо счете "как я понял"  
Почему вы не хотите открыть реальный счет ?   
Не знаю стоит ли вам учить русский , нечего хорошего в странах пост советского пространства нет. Кроме поговорки за деньги можно все или практически все   
Скорее мне надо выучить английский , что я и делаю 

Iron discipline and what emotions

Hi Gregory-1991  
  
The main reason for this Demo Account and this public PC is a security question. I don't think it's clever to publish some of your real accounts.  
I think learning Russian could be good for the international commitment like Mandarin too.   
  
Kindest regards  
FXcube

Hi FXcube,  
  
how exactly do you use the "i-fractalsEx" indicator?  
  
As I know, it repaints and uses 6 bars before and after of the actual price bar to draw the arrow. In my opinion it therefore cannot be used in live trading, only in seeing the extremes of price in the history more clearly.   
  
Do you agree?  
  
Cheers,  
Olarion

Hi FXCube, am I reading your stats on myfxbook correctly that you are currently in the red by -$28303.78 on your open orders ?  
  
So you're letting your trades go against you for 100+ pips to shoot for 10-20 pips ?

Hi Traderlarry  
  
Don't fuss!  
  
I'm not here to trade up to one's expectations.  
  
May be it could be an option to read this thread before making such statements.

I wasn't criticizing you in my post, I was just wondering what you are doing. I'll admit I didn't read the whole thread.

Hi PhAnTi'  
  
That's quite untrue!  
  
see all History Files and the published links at p.1,#1, please.

Everybody could folllow all my trades. You don't see this very often at FF!  
  
And "winnings" are really winnings without parenthesized expression.  
  
The Equity is the real result for me!  
  
All the open trades are MM and RM with Hedging Management. Consider that!  
  
More gimlet-eyed, please!  
  
I would like more sincere persons here!

[http://www.babypips.com/blogs/pipsyc...ystem.htmlDoes](http://www.babypips.com/blogs/pipsychology/does-your-personality-match-your-system.htmlDoes) Your Personality Match Your System?   
Posted 15:00 17 December 2010   
  
Does Your Personality Match Your System?  
  
In his book, "Mechanical Trading Systems: Pairing Trader Psychology with Technical Analysis," author Richard Weissman identifies three basic [trader personality](http://www.babypips.com/school/each-trader-is-unique.html) profiles: trend-following, mean-reversion, and day-trading types.   
  
**Trend-Following Systems**  
Weissman enumerates two traits necessary for successful trend-followers: _patience_ and _fortitude_.   
Trend-following [mechanical systems](http://www.babypips.com/school/mechanical-trading-systems.html) hopefully get traders in strong directional moves, and signals typically form when the trend has already begun. A typical entry strategy may be to buy at recent highs or sell at recent lows, in anticipation that the price will make a new high or low later on. This may seem counter-intuitive to the majority of traders who like to pick "tops" and "bottoms," but that's what sets trend-followers apart from the rest.  
The strength of this method is that if you catch a strong trend, you can come up with huge winning trades relative to your initial risk. But of course, no system is fool proof and there are tradeoffs to grabbing potentially big wins.   
As the saying goes, "markets range 70-80% of the time." That means catching a strong trend can be rare, and sticking to a trend-following system requires that you endure several small losses when your entry signals have you jumping in when the market consolidates or pulls back.   
To be a trend-following trader you must be comfortable with potentially having a low win ratio, but as long as your winning trades generate enough profits to outpace your losses, then that's all that matters.  
So the questions you have to ask yourself are, "do I have the mental _fortitude_ to handle more losses than wins AND do I have the _patience_ to ride the winning trades to their full profit potential?" If you answered "yes" to these questions, or if you feel stressed having to come up with numerous trade decisions in a day, then trend-following mechanical systems may be the right entry/exit method for you.   
  
**Mean Reversion Systems**  
Aside from trend-following systems, there are systems that are based on the "mean reversion" theory. In terms of price action, the theory states that on average, markets are more often trading within a range than trend, and when the market goes beyond its average range of historical volatility, it tends to fall back to the middle of that range, or the "mean." These systems aim to look for probable reversal points (i.e. tops and bottoms) where price movement could change direction.  
The major difference is that while trend following systems aim to "ride the trend" for large profits, mean reversion systems normally have an exit in mind based off key support or resistance levels. This means a lot more smaller winning trades.   
A couple of indicators used in mean reversion systems are the [ADX](http://www.babypips.com/forexpedia/ADX) and [Stochastic](http://www.babypips.com/forexpedia/Stochastics). The ADX helps identify whether the market is in a trend or rangebound, while the Stochastic indicates potential overbought and oversold conditions that tend to precede a reversal.   
The key to utilizing a mean reversion system, especially during the long-term timeframes, is maintaining rock solid discipline. Using this method could put you in the market against a strong trend, which can be psychologically difficult if it doesn't turn your way. Also, there can be many distractions and obstacles that cause psychological stress for a trader, such as the media and other traders. You must train yourself to follow your system's rules no matter what and remember that the strength of a mean reversion system is the high probability that markets will stay in a range.   
  
**Day Trading Systems**  
Lastly, we have day trading systems. These can be trending or mean reversion systems, but on a shorter time frame--Weissman cites that these generate signals for trades that last 10 days or less. Market junkies who have a knack for these kinds of fast-paced systems usually look at the hourly time frame or lower to aim for smaller profits and place tight stop losses.  
According to Weissman, mechanical systems benefit short-term traders the most as the frequency of making trade decisions arise. By using a mechanical system that already outlines what entry and exit levels to take with pre-determined risk-reward ratios, a day trader is somehow relieved from stress.   
However, this is not to say that intraday systems are all sugar, spice, and everything nice. The biggest [drawdown](http://www.babypips.com/school/drawdown-and-maximum-drawdown.html) to using them is that they are labor-intensive. Traders have to be glued to their screens during trading hours either to be ready to act on valid signals or to monitor/adjust their trades.   
Dealing with potentially volatile intraday market action, a trader must be able to quickly make sound decisions. Mental agility is critical for someone to master day trading systems and if you think that you have the capacity to find Zen amid the chaos, you may want to try out an intraday system.  
  
**So what's your trading personality?**  
You have to remember that regardless of what kind of system you're using, the market will always find a way to put you in between a rock and a hard place. There will be times that you will have more losers than winners, trades go quickly against you, or you'll have to let go of some of your unrealized profits.   
But knowing what you are comfortable with and finding the system or method that matches your personality will help you better adapt to the always-changing market environment.   
So if you think that you aren't so good in calling shots under pressure, perhaps you may want to stay away from short-term systems. On the other hand, if you think you have the discipline to stick to your plan even when price action goes against you, you may want to try out a long-term mean reversion system.   
So does your personality match the trading system that you are using? If not, how about checking out our [Forex forums](http://forums.babypips.com/) or [MeetPips.com](http://www.meetpips.com/) to find something new? Good luck!

[http://www.babypips.com/blogs/pipsyc...ot_enough.html](http://www.babypips.com/blogs/pipsychology/being_positive_is_not_enough.html)  
  
Being Positive is Not Enough  
  
While a positive mental attitude is important, it is not enough. Those of us who are in [forex currency trading](http://www.babypips.com/) also need to be able to do the following: 

  1. Use a trading method that has an edge BUT only when all the pieces come together to create a solid setup with a high probability of success.
  2. Stay focused on attaining their goals and constantly thinking about winning.

Unless you have an approach that works over a period of time and stay focused and disciplined in sticking with it, all the positive mental attitude exercises will not help you.  
To begin, you must go back to the most elementary question, '[What type of a forex trader do I want to become?](http://www.babypips.com/school/what_kind_of_trader_am_i.html)' 

  1. A scalper, intraday, or a swing trader?
  2. Based on the above, [what time frames will I trade](http://www.babypips.com/school/which_timeframe_should_i_trade.html)?
  3. Will I use traditional [lagging indicators](http://www.babypips.com/school/leading_vs_lagging_indicators.html) or a forward looking approach?
  4. Do I look at other markets to gain clues for future FX price movements?
  5. Is my initial trading plan robust and does it hold up over a large sample size of trades?
  6. Does my trading approach only look at the market one dimensionally?
  7. Do I know how to properly assess [risk](http://www.babypips.com/school/dont_lose_your_shirt.html) and manage position size accordingly?
  8. Can I sit in front of my screen and fight the temptation to trade every zig and zag or "signal" from the forums?

If you are unsure about any of the answers from above, a positive mental attitude will not benefit you much.  
Becoming a proficient trader is a journey that never ends, you simply move on to different stages of understanding and effectiveness.

5 Common Mental Mistakes New Traders Make  
  
Before you open a real live account it is important that you familiarize yourself with the most common mental mistakes new traders make. You'll probably still make them anyway, but at least you'll actually be aware you're making them which hopefully will make easier for you to correct them.  
**1\. Overconfidence**  
  
Trading for a living can be a dream come true, but it can also be a nightmare. If believe trading is easy, you're done before you even started. Trading is not easy. Trading is hard. Real hard. It's hard to consistently remain mentally focused and stay disciplined. Know that going in and you increase your chances of success big time.  
**2\. Lack of Emotional Control**  
  
Your mind always assumes the worse. It does that to protect you from harm. Because there is a potential that you'll lose money and all the mental anguish that brings, the mind tells you not to do a trade.  
You have to learn how to override this self-protecting mechanism if you want to be a trader. Talk to your mind. Tell it you are fine with doing the trade. Remind it that have a stop placed and you will not be harmed if it doesn't work out. Convince your mind that in order to make money trading you need to take risks and the risks that you are taking have been carefully planned and measured.  
**3\. Fooling yourself**  
  
Once you are in a trade do not try and justify its merit. The market does that for you. The final outcome of your trade should be a stop loss triggered, breakeven, or profit taken Once the trade is completed, don't dwell on it. Every trade is different and what worked this time may fail next time. Review it briefly and go on to next trade. Focus on the overall trading and don't spend too much time on each individual trade. This will make you an excellent trader. Accept the outcome of your trades. But don't accept not sticking to your game plan.  
**4\. Jumping the gun**  
  
Traders are constantly jumping into the right position at the wrong time because they're afraid they are going to miss it, especially at market turning points. Don't be afraid to miss the first 25% of the move; and get out after 75%. Catching 50% of a confirmed move will produce awesome results. You will also not have to deal with getting stopped out and then watch the price reverse and go in your direction.  
**5\. Not Thinking in Probabilities**  
  
Accept your trade losses as being normal. Don't beat yourself up over them or try to unnecessarily tinker with preset stop loss and take profit. Don't expect to be right 100% of the time.

[http://www.babypips.com/blogs/pipsyc...potential.html](http://www.babypips.com/blogs/pipsychology/positive_thinking_powers_your_potential.html)  
  
Positive Thinking Powers your Potential  
  
Being successful, whether it's as a Forex trader, a business owner, or even as a parent, takes a lot of personal development. Day after day you have to deal with many uncertainties, some known and many others unknown. You are continually tested by your surroundings (the currency market, your employees or coworkers, your children), and how you react before, during and after these challenges all play part in your success.  
As currency traders we all have those days (or weeks) when things just don't go our way. Our losses are overshadowing our wins, and we can't seem to consistently win. We start to wonder if we can ever make any "real" money and if becoming a full-time trader will ever be realized.  
  
  
"Why did I ever get into currency trading? It's nothing but a stress builder and a gigantic head ache. Who am I kidding? I think my hair is falling out!"  
If you've been feeling this way and are asking yourself some of the same questions, it's time to sit down and work on your positive thinking. Any successful trader will tell you that he has made the mental decision to be as positive as possible in thinking, acting and doing, and that having a positive mind is critical in overcoming the setbacks brought on while trading.  
So what can you do to become a better positive thinker?   
  
  
  
Start off the morning by looking at yourself in the mirror and saying "I'm good enough, I'm smart enough, and gosh darn it, people LIKE me!" And say it just like Stuart Smiley from Saturday Night Live... with enthusiasm! No really, promoting yourself to YOU is a great first step in the right direction. It helps you get in the right mind set, and helps you to start your day thinking positive thoughts. If looking in a mirror scares you, I'm sorry...try just saying it out loud to yourself.  
  
  
Next, observe your negative thoughts and understand that only you can change them. Once you start ridding yourself of those thoughts, you are thinking positively, while also creating a positive attitude. The market has its ups and downs. Your trading will have the same. Loses are inevitable. They happen to everyone.  
  
  
Think and visualize yourself as already being a successful trader. Imagine that your trading experience allows you to easily notice changes in the market and react to them by making profitable trades. Imagine only positive results. Imagine the wealth you've created and the lifestyle it affords you. This type of thinking will help reinforce the ideas that first led you to the currency market and motivate you to stick with it.  
  
  
Another easy method to assist you in becoming a positive thinker is to surround yourself with a positive environment. This can be your work space or the people around you. The world is filled with doubters and people who want to "help" you by destroying your dreams or shooting you out of the sky. Make it easier on YOU by surrounding yourself with other positive thinkers who reassure and support your Forex trading. And liven up your trading space so it's inviting and makes you want to be there. Maybe it's time to replace this crusty keyboard?  
  
  
Also help yourself by being a positive talker to others and about youself. Speaking positively fills your head with positive thoughts and ideas. Negative self-talk only helps to hinder your potential as a trader and keeps you from growing.   
  
  
  
Do your best to welcome the currency market's obstacles and view them as your opportunities for profits and success. Dealing with these obstacles will only help you to create a better trading experience. Small changes in the way you think about yourself, think about others and think about trading will go a long way in your overall success as a trader.

Hi Traderlarry  
  
If I earn 2000.- $ then I have to capitalize my account ten times as much and not the other way round of RRR from 2:1 or 3:1 which you could read everywhere at broker sponsored Forex Literature & articles. For my trading style with my personality and my RR and MM it's useful to manage a reward-to-risk-ratio (which aren't set in stone) from 1:10 and not from 2:1 or 3:1 Why? Because I make much money more in this way, ...the only reason, heavy-duty!  
  
  
...and PhAnTi's arguments (see #[**1436**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4333788&postcount=1436), please) has losen ones objectivity completely.  
  
He said "he doesnt play with SL"   
Here I can only reply I don't play with SL I don't trade with SL, if so then only spare.  
  
So I can only argue against once more: I don't play, I trade.   
  
  
Second blackball: "His DD is impressive".   
Drawdowns are per definition: "A drawdown is the reduction of one's capital after a series of losing trades". ([http://www.babypips.com/school/drawd...-drawdown.html](http://www.babypips.com/school/drawdown-and-maximum-drawdown.html)).  
  
More precisely: There are two types of drawdown that are considered to be the important properties of expert advisors (for instance, in MetaTrader platform) — absolute drawdown and maximal drawdown.  
  
**Absolute drawdown** is the difference between the initial deposit and the minimal point below the deposit level during all test period. It tells you how big your loss can become compared to the initial deposit during the trading. If this value was 0 during the test, then your deposit wasn’t at risk at all.  
  
**Maximal drawdown** is the maximal difference between the local maximum extremum in your equity chart and the next local minimum extremum in your equity chart. It tells you how low your strategy can go after getting some profit. It can also be called a depth of a losing streak.   
  
Excursus - in view of EA's aspects.  
Generally it’s a good idea not to trade with EAs with the maximal drawdown higher than the profit. But I don’t recommend trading even with strategies or expert advisors that have maximal drawdown at levels higher than 25% of the net profit. Mind your own risk-to-reward ratio and don’t trade with EAs that don’t comply with it.  
  
En passant  
Unfortunately, the current version of MetaTrader 4 (Build 225), the strategy tester incorrectly calculates the drawdowns, so if you are testing your EAs, it’s better to calculate both the absolute drawdown and the maximum drawdown manually.  
  
  
In my way of advanced trading style I prefere the equity and a drawdown is for me more the difference between the balance of my account, and net balance of my account. The net balance takes into account open trades that are currency in profit, or currently in loss. If you account net balance is lower than your account balance, this is called drawdown.  
  
Drawdowns are part of trading. The key to being a successful trader is coming up with trading plan that enables you to withstand these periods of large losses. And part of your trading plan is having risk management rules in place.   
  
PhAnTi' describes my drawdowns as "impressive". I don't think so. I like to trade the currency pairs logical (less emotional). I like to think in theory of probability (likelihood) and in mathematical aspects during my trading sessions with regard at my risk- and money management and my TCT-concept. At my advanced level trading I don't think so that my "drawdowns" are impressive, due to the fact that I have another risk reward ratio concept of 1:10. (Extreme Example, see #[**1462**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4338854&postcount=1462), please). At my real accounts there aren't any problems precisely because you can remargin anytime which you can't at demo accounts. In the final analysis does that mean that the profit at the real accounts are still higher and that the most part of Forex Traders Accounts seems to be extremely undercapitalized.  
  
Hope it clarifies things much more!  
  
Kindest regards  
FXcube

Exclusively for Educational Purposes  
  
Risk-Reward-Ratio 1:10   
  
(not 2:1 or 3:1)  
  
Then there could be expected winning trades ~ 9'000.-$  
  
(RM/MM/Strategy/Trading Personality).  
  
I know the risk is here too high now, because there are predominantly EURUSD orders.  
  
It's only for educational purposes with the focus of RR just now.  
  
RR 1:5  
The trades without SL has a Ratio ~ 1:5 usually, due to the fact that the most part of all trades would have been hedged.

**Risk/Reward Ratio**  
  
[http://i.investopedia.com/inv/092009.../book_icon.jpg](http://i.investopedia.com/inv/092009/dictionary/book_icon.jpg)  
**What Does _Risk/Reward Ratio_ Mean?**  
A ratio used by many investors to compare the expected returns of an investment to the amount of risk undertaken to capture these returns. This ratio is calculated mathematically by dividing the amount of profit the trader expects to have made when the position is closed (i.e. the reward) by the amount he or she stands to lose if price moves in the unexpected direction (i.e. the risk).  
  
  
[http://i.investopedia.com/inv/092009...y/inv_icon.jpg](http://i.investopedia.com/inv/092009/dictionary/inv_icon.jpg)  
**Investopedia explains _Risk/Reward Ratio_**  
Let's say a trader purchases 100 shares of XYZ Company at $20 and places a stop-loss order at $15 to ensure that her losses will not exceed $500. Let's also assume that this trader believes that the price of XYZ will reach $30 in the next few months. In this case, the trader is willing to risk $5 per share to make an expected return of $10 per share after closing her position. Since the trader stands to make double the amount that she has risked, she would be said to have a 2:1 risk/reward ratio on that particular trade. The optimal risk/reward ratio differs widely among trading strategies. Some trial and error is usually required to determine which ratio is best for a given trading strategy.

**Reward-to-Risk Ratio**  
  
[http://www.babypips.com/school/image...or/falling.png](http://www.babypips.com/school/images/junior/falling.png) Another way you can increase your chances of profitability is to trade when you have the potential to make 3 times more than you are risking. If you give yourself a 3:1 reward-to-risk ratio, you have a significantly greater chance of ending up profitable in the long run.   
  
  
Take a look at this chart as an example:  
10 Trades Loss Win **1** $1,000 **2** $3,000 **3** $1,000 **4** $3,000 **5** $1,000 **6** $3,000 **7** $1,000 **8** $3,000 **9** $1,000 **10** $3,000 **Total** $5,000 $15,000 In this example, you can see that even if you only won 50% of your trades, you would still make a profit of $10,000. Just remember that whenever you trade with a good risk to reward ratio, your chances of being profitable are much greater even if you have a lower win percentage.  
**BUT...  
** And this is a big one, like Jennifer Lopez's behind... setting large reward-to-risk ratio comes at a price. On the very surface, the concept of putting a high reward-to-risk ratio sounds good, but think about how it applies in actual trade scenarios.  
Let's say you are a scalper and you only wish to risk 3 pips. Using a 3:1 reward to risk ratio, this means you need to get 9 pips. Right off the bat, the odds are against you because you have to pay the spread.   

[http://ads.babypips.com/newads/www/d...&cb=5708aa2b7d](http://ads.babypips.com/newads/www/delivery/lg.php?bannerid=338&campaignid=84&zoneid=11&loc=1&referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.babypips.com%2Fschool%2Freward-to-risk-ratio.html&cb=5708aa2b7d)  

  
If your broker offered a 2 pip spread on EUR/USD, you'll have to gain 11 pips instead, forcing you to take a difficult 4:1 reward to risk ratio. Considering the exchange rate of EUR/USD could move 3 pips up and down within a few seconds, you would be stopped out faster than you can say "Uncle!" If you were to reduce your position size, then you could widen your stop to maintain your desired reward/risk ratio. Now, if you increased the pips you wanted to risk to 50, you would need to gain 153 pips. By doing this, you are able to bring your reward-to-risk ratio somewhere nearer to your desired 3:1. Not so bad anymore, right?   
  
In the real world, reward-to-risk ratios aren't set in stone. They must be adjusted depending on the time frame, market environment, and your entry/exit points. A position trade could have a reward-to-risk ratio as high as 10:1 while a scalper could go for as little as 0.7:1.

**Drawdown and Maximum Drawdown**  
  
[http://www.babypips.com/school/image...er-coaster.png](http://www.babypips.com/school/images/junior/roller-coaster.png)  
  
So we know that money management will make us money in the long run, but now we'd like to show you the other side of things. What would happen if you didn't use money management rules?   
  
Consider this example:   
Let's say you have a $100,000 and you lose $50,000. What percentage of your account have you lost?   
The answer is 50%.   
Simple enough.   
This is what traders call a drawdown.  
  
A drawdown is the reduction of one's capital after a series of losing trades. This is normally calculated by getting the difference between a relative peak in equity capital minus a relative trough. Traders normally note this down as a percentage of their trading account.   
  
  
[](http://www.babypips.com/school/images/senior/drawdown-peak-to-trough.png)[http://www.babypips.com/school/image...-to-trough.png](http://www.babypips.com/school/images/senior/drawdown-peak-to-trough.png)  
**Losing Streak**  
  
<http://www.babypips.com/school/images/junior/sos.png>  
  
In trading, we are always looking for an edge. That is the whole reason why traders develop systems. A trading system that is 70% profitable sounds like a very good edge to have. But just because your trading system is 70% profitable, does that mean for every 100 trades you make, you will win 7 out of every 10?   
Not necessarily! How do you know which 70 out of those 100 trades will be winners?   
The answer is that you don't. You could lose the first 30 trades in a row and win the remaining 70. That would still give you a 70% profitable system, but you have to ask yourself, "Would you still be in the game if you lost 30 trades in a row?"   
This is why money management is so important. No matter what system you use, you will eventually have a losing streak. Even professional poker players who make their living through poker go through horrible losing streaks, and yet they still end up profitable.   
  
The reason is that the good poker players practice money management because they know that they will not win every tournament they play. Instead, they only risk a small percentage of their total bankroll so that they can survive those losing streaks.   
This is what you must do as a trader. Drawdowns are part of trading. The key to being a successful trader is coming up with trading plan that enables you to withstand these periods of large losses. And part of your trading plan is having risk management rules in place.   
Only risk a small percentage of your "trading bankroll" so that you can survive your losing streaks. Remember that if you practice strict money management rules, you will become the casino and in the long run, "you will always win."

In the real world, reward-to-risk ratios aren't set in stone. They must be adjusted depending on the time frame, market environment, and your entry/exit points. A position trade could have a reward-to-risk ratio as high as 10:1 while a scalper could go for as little as 0.7:1.   
  
&  
  
Trading without Stop Loss could demand a reward-to-risk-ratio around 1:10.

A risk-reward Ratio from 1:10 sound horrible if you read this at first.  
  
If I think about that it seems for me more a realistical expectation.  
  
Why?  
  
If I make per day 5'000.-$ with a stable drawdown around 90'000.-$ then this drawdown is capitalized by over 50% after 9 trading days.  
  
It's simple and profitable.  
  
If I try to think more technically then the Risk-Reward-Ratio of 1:10 or 10:1 is for me only a question of perception. Then perception could be like this.  
  
In [ psychology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology) and the [ cognitive sciences](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_science), **perception** is the process of attaining awareness or understanding of [ sensory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense) [ information](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information). It is a task far more complex than was imagined in the 1950s and 1960s, when it was proclaimed that building perceiving machines would take about a decade, but, needless to say, that is still very far from reality. The word _perception_ comes from the Latin _perception-, percepio,_ , meaning "receiving, collecting, action of taking possession, apprehension with the mind or senses."  
  
When presented with multiple ways to perceive things, it is our choice of which we accept. Below is a very common perception test:  
  
  
[](http://img.sparknotes.com/101s/psychology/05.11.face.vase.jpg)[http://img.sparknotes.com/101s/psych....face.vase.jpg](http://img.sparknotes.com/101s/psychology/05.11.face.vase.jpg)  
  
What do you see? Is there a vase, or two faces? The answer is both. Which of the two options you see first is based on your perception of the image.

**Edwin Garrigues Boring** (October 23, 1886-July 1, 1968) was an [experimental psychologist](http://www.thefullwiki.org/Experimental_psychology) who later became one of the first [historians](http://www.thefullwiki.org/Historians) of [psychology](http://www.thefullwiki.org/Psychology).  
  
**Life**  
  
From 1924 to 1949 Boring was director of the psychological laboratory at [Harvard University](http://www.thefullwiki.org/Harvard_University), where his goal became to free psychology from its status as a subsection of the Department of Philosophy. Boring was successful and established an independent Department of Psychology in 1934. He emphasized the use of the experimental method to investigate psychological questions rather than the tools of philosophy.[[1]](http://www.thefullwiki.org/E._G._Boring#cite_note-0)  
Among his studies on visual perception, Boring gave prominence to the ambiguous illusion depicting either a young woman or an old woman, which has often been referred to as the Boring Figure after the researcher.  
He was president of the [American Psychological Association](http://www.thefullwiki.org/American_Psychological_Association) in 1928.[[2]](http://www.thefullwiki.org/E._G._Boring#cite_note-1)

Hi Gregory!  
  
Yes of course, so you have to wait till the EMA-Lines crosses. I go often earlier in the market and hedge if orders are going further on in the counterpart direction. Concerning the Pivotal I'm in the market just now, and take the higher risk over.  
  
Yes you're absolutely right! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
Many thanks for the clarification.  
  
Nice charts! Keep it up!  
  
You're wellcome!

**Forex Trading & Sandboxes   
Do they really have some common features?  
  
  
  
Sandboxes fascinate me. You can live in a concrete jungle yet right there in the middle of city smog, metal swing sets and wooden benches is a box containing sand imported from Rightly, who knows where?   
  
Watching children at play in those sandboxes is especially delightful. The sound of their giggles, the way they work so intently to build their castles or other castle-like architecture with such greag focus they don't see or hear what's going on around them. Adorable. Not so adorable when you consider that as we Perfect into entrepreneurs, many of us treat our business as However we were still playiny in the sandbox.   
  
The sandbox feels safe. The boundaries or safe zones are clearly identified by the four corners that make up the box itself. You can bring tools with you when you enter the sandbox but once you're in, you pretty much stick to playing with what you've got. There is no question that you can have a successfful business in the safe zone. However, to create wild success you've got to stop building sand castles and begin building your empire!   
  
Here are four steps (there are more!) to get you out of the safe zone and into the Wild Success Zone:   
  
1\. Know what you want.   
  
Nothing is greater than having clarity of purpose - the reason you jump Lacking of bed each morning anxious for Which the day brings. As a child you were asked, what do you want to be when you grow up? Now that you're all grown up (well, not entirely I hope) ask yourself,- what do I Inadequacy the rest of my life to stand for? Your personal brand, business systems and overall structure are designed around the answer to this quetsion.   
  
2\. Be clear on your motives.   
  
I recently read that entrepreneurship is all about being of service and I couldn't agree more. An entrepreneur has the Chance; fit to sniff out what a market needs and/or wants, then creates a solution to satisfy that need/want. If the solution does in fact satisfy the need (and assuming a strong brand and promotion is in place), you're on your way to hitting a home run. Do you ever feel like you're spinning your wheels in your Trade? You might be stuck in the safe zone creating services or products that you think your market wants. Your intention comes from the right place but Whether you are truly going to serve others, you must be clear on their needs first.   
  
3\. Shake it off.   
  
There is a time and place for sticking with the tried and true. If you want to achieve wild success, you must be willing to step out of the safe zone and shake off what no longer serves you. As an entrepreneur, you put your heart and soul into your business. After all, for many small business entrepreneurs, you are your business. Just as the seasons change, each year brings new insights, revelations and growth opportunities. The persons' alliances and methods that once served you may have changed seasons. Are you changing with it or are you getting in the way of your own success?   
  
4\. Do it afraid!   
  
Moving out off your comfort zone isn't easy. Frankly, only a select few have the courage to step out of that sandbox. Is it scary? You bet! Is it gratifying? Absolutely! What I've learned about fear is this: fear is an emotion, a Sensation that you either let control you or you control it. The Election to build more than sand castles is completely yours. There are myriad of tools and resources to help you conquer the Apprehend and play bigger than you thought possible. As secure as the safe zone is, the wild Prosperity zone is so much better. Come on step inside!

Hi Rufus  
  
I hope it could be a platform where some constructive-minded traders could find something which could help in the progress of development to a successful trader or getting here and there even better skills.  
  
May be a little exceptional, particular or so, even so it's my style.  
  
Hope it helps.  
  
Best regards

If you make a Multiple-Time-Frame Analyse often you have the same as described at #[**1471**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4339122&postcount=1471) as a Boring Figure (young woman or an old woman), isn't it?  
  
To make a multiple time frame analyse more effective you have to do the job in the right way how to filter out the relevant data. That's as well as the case may be a question of perception.

I prefere to trade the TCT without any Stop Loss (most of the time, whereas with Hedging here and there) and then with a Reward-to-Risk-Ratio from 1:10  
  
See the Example below, please.  
  
"Advanced Trading Style"  
If you make 5'000.-$ a Day (with a 250'000.- $ Account) you have to capitalize your Negativ-Saldo (neg. RRR) after 10 Trading Days.  
  
  
"To put the card before the horse"  
I have do then only the job to make exclusively the "1" before the "10" every Day and this ten times, but only once. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
May be it sounds like to rock sb.'s world. I don't know!  
  
Kindest regards

Trade Example  
Ger30Mar11, M1, 2011 January 27  
  
Enter Short at DR1 7178.5 & Exit at EMA200  
  
Profit: 7'186.24$ ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
(within a few minutes)  
  
If you have a clever discipline and you can clever wait so here is an example how to make much money at the precise moment.  
It's not necessary to trade the whole day and I wouldn't dream of it that a M1-Divergence could tell much. No it isn't!  
The Pivotal Point has given me the most powerful argument in this trading situation at this moment.

Mind Games – The Psychology of Forex Market Trading  
  
When it comes to trading on the Forex market, winning is a matter of the mind rather than mind over matter. Any trader who’s been in the game for any length of time will tell you that psychology has a lot to do with both your own performance on the trading floor and with the way that the market is moving. Playing a winning hand depends on knowing your own mind – and understanding the way that psychology moves the market.  
  
Studying the psychology of the market is nothing new. It doesn’t take a genius to understand that any arena that rides and falls on decisions made by people is going to be heavily influenced by the minds of people. Few people take into account all the various levels of mind games that motivate the market, though. If you keep your eye on the way that psychology influences others – including the mass psychology of the people that use the currency on a daily basis – but neglect to know what moves you, you’re going to end up hurting your own position. The best Forex coaches will tell you that before you can really become a successful trader, you have to know yourself and the triggers that influence you. Knowing those will help you overcome them or use them. Are you saying ‘Huh?” about now? Believe me, I understand. I felt the same way the first time that someone tried to explain how the mind games we play with ourselves influence the trades and decisions that we make. Let me break it down into more manageable pieces for you.  
  
Anything involving winning or losing large sums of money becomes emotionally charged.  
  
All right. You’ve heard that playing the market is a mathematical game. Plug in the right numbers, make the right calculations and you’ll come out ahead. So why is it that so many traders end up on the losing end of the market? After all, everyone has access to the same numbers, the same data, the same info – if it’s math, there’s only one right answer, right?   
The answer lies in interpretation. The numbers don’t lie, but your mind does. Your hopes and fears can make you see things that just aren’t there. When you invest in a currency, you’re investing more than just money – you make an emotional investment. Being ‘right’ becomes important. Being ‘wrong’ doesn’t just cost you money when you let yourself be ruled by your emotions – it costs you pride. Why else would you let a loser ride in the hope that it will bounce back? It’s that little thing inside your head that says, “I KNOW I’m right on this, dammit!”  
  
Bottom line: You can’t keep emotions out of the picture, but you can learn not to let them control your decisions.   
To most people, being right is more important than making money.  
Here’s the deal. The way to make real money in the forex market is to cut your losses short and let your winners ride. In order to do that, you have GOT to accept that some of your trades are going to lose, cut them loose and move on to another trade. You’ve got to accept that picking a loser is NOT an indication of your self-worth, it’s not a reflection on who you are. It’s simply a loss, and the best way to deal with it is to stop losing money by moving on – and really move on. Moving on means you don’t keep a running total of how many losses you’ve had – that’s the way to paralyze yourself. This brings us to the next point:  
  
Losing traders see loss as failure. Winning traders see loss as learning.  
  
Not too long ago, my twelve year old son told me that before Thomas Edison invented a working light bulb, he invented 100 light bulbs that didn’t work. But he didn’t give up – because he knew that creating a source of light from electricity was possible. He believed in his overall theory – so when one design didn’t work, he simply knew that he’d eliminated one possibility. Keep eliminating possibilities long enough, and you’ll eventually find the possibility that works.  
  
Winning traders see loss in the same way. They haven’t failed – they’ve learned something new about the way that they and the market work.  
  
Winning traders can look at the big picture while playing in the small arena.  
  
Suppose I told you that last year, I made 75 trades that lost money, and 25 that made money. In the eyes of most people, that would make me a pretty poor trader. I’m wrong 75% of the time. But what if I told you that my average loss was $1000, but my average profit on a winning trade was $10,000? That means that I lost $75,000 on trades – but I made $250,000, making my overall profit $175,000. It’s a pretty clear numbers game – but how do you keep on trading when you’re losing in trade after trade? Simple – just remember that one trade does not make or break a trader. Focus on the trade at hand, follow the triggers that you’ve set up – but define yourself by what really matters – the overall record.

decided to ask you a few questions.  
1.C what broker you work (preferably a link)?  
2\. some time to work do you recommend?  
of good news for me, I was again profitable

\--------  
Сделав очередной шаг к осознанию прицепов работы с Time Cell Trading   
решил задать вам пару вопросов.  
1.С каким брокером вы работаете (желательно ссылку) ?  
2\. какое время для работы вы рекомендуете ?  
из приятных новостей для меня я снова прибыльный 

Iron discipline and what emotions

Hi Gregory-1991  
  
I apologize that I don't make the name of my brokers public.  
What I would recommend is EURUSD down long term around 1.37/1.40, Target: 1.25 this year & a Long Term Carry Trade GBPTRY Sell ~2.565, Target: 2.345. Temporary trades? "Ger30mar11" are given a great desin at H1/H4 Level with CCI(14) Tops & Bottoms and supplementary with divergence trading here. Last one you can find at the Broker [Activtrades](/brokers/activtrades "View ActivTrades Broker Profile") <http://www.activtrades.co.uk/index.aspx>.  
  
Be aware that I don't trade without any stop loss, so it's absolutely equal for me if the price would run in the counterpart direction for a time. My trading concept allows me the waiting pending acceptance.  
  
Kindest regards  
FXcube

GBPCHF, Daily, 2011 January 30  
  
A Hidden Bullish Divergence might forces your decision for some enter longs ;-/  
  
Hidden bullish divergence happens when price is making a higher low (HL), but the oscillator is showing a lower low (LL).   
This can be seen when the pair is in an uptrend. Once price makes a higher low, look and see if the oscillator does the same. If it doesn't and makes a lower low, then we've got some hidden divergence in our hands.  
  
H1 & H4 make further out a strong case for trading it (see #[**1502**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4356097&postcount=1502), please).

Taking into consideration that Forex market spends up to 50% time in non-trending, sideways state, the knowledge of how to deal with range-bound markets becomes vital.  
  
What is the simplest thing we know about the range-bound market?  
  
...Its beginning is difficult to spot. Quite often by the time we realize that the market is ranging we’ve already made few errors and paid for it.  
  
We'll use the main rule: if the market is not trending, always treat it as a ranging market.

Yeap thats what i do. Besides, either way is fine by me, as long as they keep volume below 90/min, above that and im biting my nails, not able to reach the keyboard.  
  
Tuesdays have a strange rangyness to it, it looks to me like people are hawks on price at tuesdays, waiting for someone to do something so they can join in, more then usual on tuesdays. I think tuesdays has become the new monday, people dont trade much on mondays and instead do their main thing on tuesday, i think thats why it screws a bit with my calculations.   
  
By the way id like to pick your brain on economy of the world in general, the euro, the dollar what you think about world leaders going around talking about the end of the dollar and a one world currency. Will Germany eventually be fed up with dragging the heavy load of southern european countries debt? What is the view of the public in Zurich on the euro, will it survive? If you feel like it, come on down to the debate table and talk bout some of this stuff.  
  
Keep it up Cube, you the man!

Market Price has reached the DR1 at 1.3709  
  
Good time for making some pips in down.  
  
Trade M1/M5  
  
  
If the lines of M1/EMA50 & M5/EMA10 will be broken down I will go in with higher lots shorts.

see #[**1502**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4356097&postcount=1502), please.  
  
...and this could be an example for a H1 Result  
  
Profit: 1'307.05 $   
  
If you would have go in the longs at the January 28 (say Friday evening 19/20:00 GMT +1 after the divergence) might be you could have make even much more profit!

H4 is showing a divergence.   
  
I take the risk over with an enter short around 92.15  
  
It's a little risky because of vola.

Hi Yaed  
  
I apologize, I'm not the man for exchange views. It needs too much time, for discussing around the right crystall ball. I trade in my own reality which is here and now. I know there are a lot of intelligent economical conversations like WEF.  
  
I think generally that the market could be depend this year at more uncontrollable events done by assassinations, national deficits and one or two abrupt FX Market crashes & political upheavals like Egypt presently, (as a consequence the higher oil prices over hundreds of pips at one day),... like a premonition of what was to come. (So may be an EURUSD 1.40 - 1.15/0.95).  
  
Sorry!  
  
Best regards  
FXcube

Volatilities  
<http://www.mataf.net/en/tools/02-01-volatility>  
  
In [finance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance), **volatility** most frequently refers to the [standard deviation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) of the continuously compounded returns of a [financial instrument](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_instrument) within a specific time horizon. It is common for discussions to talk about the volatility of a security's price, even while it is the returns' volatility that is being measured. It is used to quantify the [risk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk) of the financial instrument over the specified time period. Volatility is normally expressed in annualized terms, and it may either be an absolute number (_$5_) or a fraction of the mean (_5%_).

5 Steps For Trading In Forex Market Volatility  
By [Richard Lee](http://www.tradingmarkets.com/authors/all/Richard_Lee)   
  
An increase in market volatility often leads traders to find a lot more trading opportunities. The huge market usually swings lots of potential for gain, but also for loss, especially if traders do not take the necessary precautions.   
During times of volatility, traders need to adjust their strategy to compensate for erratic market. [The FX Markets](http://www.thefxmarkets.com/fxvolatility/) also provides a great section on their site showing traders which currency pairs are experiencing the most and least volatility that day.  
  
**1\. Decrease in Leverage**   
During times of extreme volatility, losses may seem traumatic. With the average daily pip movement increased in volatile times, traders should be considering how their leverage will affect their trades. At a one percent or even a half percent margin, investors should be mindful of how much leverage, or even the size position being traded, can affect their portfolio.  
In normal market conditions, placing a 2 lot position is fine when you are looking to make about 50-100 pips. During a more volatile time, when the potential loss is 100-200 pips, it stops being an effective risk to reward ratio. To compensate, traders should look to taking on smaller trading positions, in this case only one lot as opposed to the average 2 lot position.  
  
  
**2\. Use Tighter Stops**   
Many traders are hesitant to use tighter stops in volatile markets because they see the large swings increases the likelihood that the position will be taken out. Having tighter stops can also provide great risk managers in times of extreme volatility. For example, on a EUR/USD trade, rather than setting an 80 pip stop to protect your position, consider placing a 50-60 pip stop. This will insure the protection of your currency position and if the stop is broken, there is a higher likelihood that the trend will continue lower and the stop took you out before you could potentially lose more money.  
The width of the stop being set does depend on the currency pair being traded, as some pairs have wider ranges. In a Yen cross like the GBP/JPY or AUD/JPY, traders may be more likely to have wider stops as their average daily range is 50% more than that of the EUR/USD. With that said, stops during volatile market conditions should not be as wide as before. Instead of a stop of 100 pips below entry, traders may consider a 25 pip reduction and have a 75 pip stop.  
  
  
Below is a chart showing the EUR/USD and the GBP/JPY on the same very volatile day in the forex market. The EUR/USD had an impressive range of nearly 600 pips! The GBP/JPY far dominated though with nearly a 2000 pip trading range.  
  
  
[http://images.tradingmarkets.com/200...o/1105Lee1.jpg](http://images.tradingmarkets.com/2008/HowTo/1105Lee1.jpg)  
  
**3\. Be Selective with Trades**   
In volatile market conditions, traders are often tempted to place an increase in trades as the market is going wild and they want to take advantage of all the trading opportunities. It is important to remember that in volatile times, losses are likely to be big. Before placing a trade, assess risk tolerance levels. How much risk is acceptable for the trader both psychologically and financially? It may be a good idea for a trader to shift their interest somewhere else until things settle down, instead of trading a violent pair.  
  
  
**4\. Increase Discipline When Trading**   
During all market conditions, traders should follow their predetermined trading strategy. During volatile market conditions, it is important to use that same level of restraint and self discipline. Any set stops, contingency plans or risk management benchmarks must be adhered to without hesitation. This will help in defining how much risk is taken and should price action be uncontrollable.   
  
  
  
**5\. Know Before You Go**  
It also helps a trader to know what is causing the current spate of volatility in the markets in order to be prepared for the unexpected. As such, an investor can accommodate their strategy to the market environment and not just the currency pair being traded. The first of these considerations is accounting for emotions in a market: is fear currently driving the market lower? Or is it buyer's mania that is keeping the bullish tone alive? Traders' overreaction and emotion tend to push markets to overextended targets. This fact alone creates volatility through simple supply and demand.  
Volatility can also, and more than likely will, be sparked by economic events. In this instance, market participants may interpret fundamental data differently and not as cut and dry as the more novice trader. A perfect example of this is usually monthly manufacturing reports that are released in pretty much all industrial economies.  
  
  
The classic scenario has the market honed in on a particular number for the month. However, traders young and old will sometimes wonder why the market sold off if manufacturing showed positive growth. The answer is simple. The market had a different interpretation and positions were violently reshaped and shifted. These tend to create great opportunities for some and horrible memories for others. Below is an hourly chart of the EUR/USD during ISM Manufacturing for October 1, 2008. Here we can see the huge price gap that occurred due to market volatility as well as the resulting trend.  
  
  
[http://images.tradingmarkets.com/200...o/1105Lee2.jpg](http://images.tradingmarkets.com/2008/HowTo/1105Lee2.jpg)  
  
  
Panic and erratic momentum can additionally be found in certain market environments. Not to be confused with fear or greed, panic selling and buying can create very choppy and relatively untraceable markets. These conditions will lead some to flip flop their positions while leaving others gaping at the fact that the position was right, only to be stopped out prematurely. These two common examples will create further panic and volatility as traders abandon their own individual strategy for the possibility of instant profits or stoppage revenge. As a result, a vicious cycle of volatility ensues until a definitive market direction can be established.  
The simple rules above, and a task of getting to know the current trading environment, can empower every trader through the ranks. Although some relate volatility with difficult and untouchable markets, opportunities continue to remain abound in these less than attractive conditions to those focused and fortunate.  
  
  
By following these five simple steps, trading in volatile market conditions should be a little simpler. Remember to adjust leverage based on volatility, stick to how much risk your trading plan already determines, use tight stops and don't jump into every trade that looks good.

**<http://forex-indicators.net/volatility-indicators>  
  
**Forex Volatility Indicators  
Volatility Indicators show the size and the magnitude of price fluctuations.  
In any market there are periods of high volatility (high intensity) and low volatility (low intensity).  
  
These periods come in waves: low volatility is replaced by increasing volatility, while after a period of high volatility there comes a period of low volatility and so on.  
  
Volatility indicators measure the intensity of price fluctuations, providing an insight into the market activity level.  
  
Volatility Indicators:  
[Average True Range (ATR)](http://forex-indicators.net/volatility-indicators/atr)   
[Bollinger Bands (BB)](http://forex-indicators.net/volatility-indicators/bollinger-bands)  
Bollinger Bands Width  
Chaikin Volatility (CHV)  
  
The methodology of using Volatility indicators  
Low volatility suggest a very little interest in the price, but at the same time it reminds that the market is resting before a new large move  
Low volatility periods are used to set up the breakout trades. For example, when the bands of the Bollinger bands indicator squeeze tight, Forex traders anticipate an explosive breakout way outside the bands limit.  
  
A rule of thumb is: a change in volatility leads to a change in price.  
  
Another thing to remember about volatility is that while a low volatility can hold for an extended period of time, high volatility is not that durable and often disappears much sooner.

Yes i understand your view. Now on the note of volatility, as you posted some info in that just now and as we are seeing a lot of that right now i am wondering if you know any website that tries to make predictions of volatility/volume based on scheduled news and things like that? To me there is no real difference between volatility and volume, and i really need a way of at least giving me some indication of what volumes to expect during the day.  
  
On another note i asked you a while ago if you used specific levels for CCI, watching if anything significant happens at these times. You told me you hadnt delved into that specifically. On that note i want to tell you that i use CCI 20, typical price with such levels at 190 and -190. Applied to E/U M1. So heres what it means to me: Beyond/above those levels price is strongly bought/sold, thats the basic interpretation. But thats not all: If this level is surpassed fast, often in one candle, then the re-entry is a key moment, the 190 is a decent reason to sell, the -190 is a decent reason to buy. Now i would not enter a trade based only on that, but watch it and you can see there is at least something to it. As you and i well know, you need more reasons then one to enter a trade, but it is a guideline i use as well as envelopes, moving averages, S/R and stochastic.  
  
By the way i sometimes enter a trade, it goes well and i close it and afterwards i realise it was a CCI divergence, and then i think of you.  
  
Anyway happy pipping meanwhile and ill check back with you in a while.  
  
P.S. I see brent crude has just touched 102 USD, oh how the yankies will whine and dine over their "expensive" gasoline, here its about 2 USD/litre (13+SEK) because of our high taxes on gas.

**Taking Advantage Of Central Bank Interventions**  
  
****by Richard Lee** ([Contact Author](http://www.investopedia.com/contact.aspx?ContentType=A&Subject=Investopedia%20Contact%20Form&ContentID=6185) | [Biography](http://www.investopedia.com/contributors/default.aspx?id=114))**  
It seems that every country's [central bank](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/centralbank.asp) these days is involved in some sort of capital control over their currency. Set aside from standard monetary and fiscal strategies, these policies are used to keep domestic denominations under control while keeping a country's growth stable. One of the most frequented strategies used by policy makers is direct market intervention. Japan's central [bank](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/11/taking-advantage-central-banks.asp?partner=fxweekly1#) has used the strategy on more than one occasion. By printing [Japanese yen](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jpy.asp) to sell, and buying back U.S. dollars, the Bank of Japan is controlling the value of its exchange rate against the American currency. (To learn more, see _[The U.S. Dollar And The Yen: An Interesting](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/09/japanese-yen-us-treasury-bonds.asp)_ _[Partnership](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/09/japanese-yen-us-treasury-bonds.asp)_.)  
  
But that's not the only method that is being used, and the Bank of Japan is certainly not the only one intervening in the [FX market](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/forex/f/forex-market.asp). So let's take a look at some other capital control strategies that are being used by global central [banks](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/11/taking-advantage-central-banks.asp?partner=fxweekly1#) and how to take advantage of such an opportunity.  
  
**Korea's Intervention**  
South Korea, with an export economy similar to Japan's, is a country that has also been known to intervene in the foreign exchange markets directly in order to control the rise and fall of its currency, the [South Korean won (KRW)](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/krw.asp). But things have changed, and South Korea's central bank is looking for additional means of control. An alternative to applying direct intervention in the markets, government officials and the Bank of Korea are beginning to audit banks and larger institutions handling currency market transactions.   
  
Aimed at curbing speculation, the regulations tighten requirements on the country's banks trading in large [currency derivatives](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/derivative.asp), potentially punishing those that are unprofessionally or improperly transacting in the market.  
Aiding in the reduction of currency speculation, the strategy increases government scrutiny over market positioning and would support higher requirements on currency positions for foreign currency speculators. All in all, the measure looks to gradually reduce interest in the South Korean won as it becomes more costly to trade currency in the country.  
Another way to curb interest and speculation in a country's currency is through higher foreign investment taxes.   
  
**Brazil's Tax Change**  
The Brazilian government implemented measures in order to curb its own currency's speculation – aside from directly selling [Brazilian reals](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/forex/a/brl-brazilian-real.asp) and buying U.S. dollars. One such measure is to increase the foreign tax rate on [fixed income](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixed-incomesecurity.asp) (or bond) [investments](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/11/taking-advantage-central-banks.asp?partner=fxweekly1#). The tax rate would affect foreign investors attempting to take advantage of a stronger BRL/USD exchange rate through large purchases of Brazilian bond investments. Originally at 2%, the tax rate increased to 6% as of October 2010.  
Increasing the country's foreign tax rate is going to make transacting in Brazil more costly for speculators in banks and larger [financial institutions](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/11/taking-advantage-central-banks.asp?partner=fxweekly1#) abroad – supporting a disinterest in the Brazilian currency and decreasing the amount of "hot money" flowing into the Brazilian economy. (To learn more, see _[The New World Of Emerging Market Currencies](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/07/emergingmarketcurrencies.asp)_.)  
  
**Using Central Bank Interventions to Your Advantage**  
Global central banks sometimes refer to strategies and tools that are already at their disposal. We all know that market speculation accelerates when central banks raise [interest rates](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp). During these times, investors look to capture any yield difference between their own currencies and higher yielding currencies. But, in times of massive market speculation, central banks may be forced to actually cut [interest rates](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/11/taking-advantage-central-banks.asp?partner=fxweekly1#) – hoping to deter any speculation on higher interest rates.  
  
Central banks lowering interest rates are hoping to narrow the yield differential with other economies – making it less attractive for currency speculators attempting to take advantage of a wider yield difference. But, how can one take advantage of these opportunities?  
It's simple. Although central banks apply [capital](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/11/taking-advantage-central-banks.asp?partner=fxweekly1#) controls on their domestic currencies, these policies tend to do little damage to the overall trend. In the short term, the announcement will temporarily shock markets. But, in the long run, the market ultimately reverts back to its original path. (Learn more in _[Interest Rates Matter For Forex Traders](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/08/interest-rates.asp)_.)   
  
**An Example of How to Profit**  
Announcements of intervention offer great opportunities to initiate positions in the same direction as the recent trend. Let's take a look at the direct intervention efforts of the Bank of Japan on September 15, 2010.   
In Figure 1, the USD/JPY exchange rate was moving lower since May 2010 on massive currency speculation. It was during this time that traders bought Japanese yen and sold U.S. dollars on the news that China was [investing](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/11/taking-advantage-central-banks.asp?partner=fxweekly1#) in Japanese bonds. The momentum helped the Japanese yen appreciate against the U.S. dollar from an exchange rate of about 95 per U.S. dollar to 84 in a matter of three months.  
  
  
  
[http://i.investopedia.com/inv/articl...ntralBank1.gif](http://i.investopedia.com/inv/articles/site/CentralBank1.gif) Figure 1   
  
As a result of the yen's quick appreciation, the Bank of Japan decided to intervene for the first time in six years. At 84, the USD/JPY exchange rate was becoming too much for exporters to handle. The stronger yen was making Japanese products uncompetitive overseas. The announcement caused the USD/JPY currency pair to jump almost 300 [pips](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pip.asp) overnight. In Figure 2, we can see the effects of intervention on our daily chart.  
  
  
  
[http://i.investopedia.com/inv/articl...ntralBank2.gif](http://i.investopedia.com/inv/articles/site/CentralBank2.gif) Figure 2   
Now, this is where it gets interesting. The intervention efforts by the Bank of Japan drove the currency to test projected resistance (red line) dating back to the currency's short-term top in May. Zooming in (Figure 3), we can see that the next two days produced two [dojis](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/doji.asp) just below support at 86.00 (red line). Dojis signify that momentum in the market following the intervention is exhausted – a sign of resistance failure.  
  
  
  
[http://i.investopedia.com/inv/articl...ntralBank3.gif](http://i.investopedia.com/inv/articles/site/CentralBank3.gif) Figure 3   
  
Attempting to enter into the current bearish trend, we place a short entry at 85.50. This is just enough to confirm a breakdown in the short-term price action while remaining just below the 86.00 support. A corresponding stop is placed about 100-125 pips above our entry price - just enough to keep us in the position.  
As expected, the overall bearish USD/JPY market trend continued with the pair dropping to support 80.25 before retracing a bit. This makes the USD/JPY short trade profitable by a maximum of 525 pips – maintaining a [risk to reward ratio](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskrewardratio.asp) of almost five to one.  
  
  
  
[http://i.investopedia.com/inv/articl...ntralBank4.gif](http://i.investopedia.com/inv/articles/site/CentralBank4.gif) Figure 4   
**Bottom Line**  
With increased speculation in the market, central banks will continue to apply capital controls in order to control their currency's exchange rates. These present great opportunities for retail [investors](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/11/taking-advantage-central-banks.asp?partner=fxweekly1#) and traders to seize entries into longer-term trends – as intervention scenarios rarely work for the policy makers.

Hi Yaed  
  
That's not correct. I have make many trials with the CCI at different levels, before I go public at FF with the CCI(14), ...before so also the CCI 20. My final results have get the option that the CCI14 is for my trading style with the multiple time frame analyzes the favored one.

> Yes i understand your view. Now on the note of volatility, as you posted some info in that just now and as we are seeing a lot of that right now i am wondering if you know any website that tries to make predictions of volatility/volume based on scheduled news and things like that? To me there is no real difference between volatility and volume, and i really need a way of at least giving me some indication of what volumes to expect during the day.

Hi yead  
  
Here're some Basics  
Volume is volume of trades. In exchange-based markets, discrete information about the quantity of trades over delta t is available. In forex, however, one relies on price ticks per delta t.  
  
Momentum is rather subjective. In my case, I view momentum as how the bullish moves compare to the bearish moves. If one side is bigger than the other, the momentum is "heavier" towards one side.   
  
Volatility is a measure of price displacement over delta t. I guess you can also call it speed, as volatility does not tell you exactly where price is going or if it is even going anywhere, for that matter. ATR is a good measure of volatility and you'll notice that it changes throughout the day as sessions begin and end.   
  
  
You can google all these by yourself. I'm not your secretary!  
  
e.g.  
google search: "volume volatility forex" (287'000 results 0.22 sec.)  
  
I won't waste time on it!  
  
  
Kindest regards

Think outside the Box  
  
Stop bothering me with the concepts of "2% stop loss" or the "reward-to-risk-ratio". I can't understand it! I have a bias towards other statistical parameters.  
  
<Non-Stop-Loss-Concept>  
See also p.20, #[**293**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3966109&postcount=293); p.44, #[**652**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4023441&postcount=652) ;  
  
_I have my own beliefs in intellectual property rights and the laws which govern the distribution of such, and will act accordingly. I will not try and convince anyone of my stance._  
  
The most part of my trades are without any stop loss. I don't like to trade with crutches but with the addition of negative on balance!  
  
Financial orientation - raw data  
Try to capitalize the bonanzas with 1:10, say if I make a daily profit around 15'000.-$ so the minus input has to capitalize with 150'000.-$ (another example see, #[**1552**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4372965&postcount=1552)) & the rest might be hedged.  
  
Financial orientation - raw data  
So often you could see open orders between -50'000.- and -180'000.-$ (negative on balance) at the account:  
[http://www.myfxbook.com/members/Fore...000--day/77119](http://www.myfxbook.com/members/Forexcube/1000--day/77119)  
  
Financial orientation - raw data  
The ratio "Open Trades" to "History" should be around 1:9. (The "History" shouldn't contain any loss orders)  
  
Instruction:  
1\. Step -Target: Double (triple, quadruple) your money and withdraw all negative open orders above at the finish.   
2\. Step: Close the account at the finish & open a new account & make the same procedure as before.  
3\. Step: Try to guide 7-15 accounts per year net into plus (net value: 700 x 1500%), say if 3 should completely wrecked, handle 10-18. (Maximum open accounts almost of the same time: by a factor of 2 to 5).  
  
Kindest regards

**Patience to Gain Knowledge through Study and Focus**  
  
Many new traders believe all you need to profitably trade foreign currencies are charts, technical indicators and a small bankroll. Most of them blow up (lose all their money) within a few weeks or months; some are initially successful and it takes as long as a year before they blow up. A tiny minority with good money management skills, patience, and a market niche go on to be successful traders. Armed with charts, technical indicators, and a small bankroll, the chance of succeeding is probably 500 to 1.  
  
To increase your chances of success to near certainty requires knowledge; acquiring knowledge takes hard work, study, dedication and focus. Compile your knowledge base without taking any shortcuts, thereby assuring a solid foundation to build upon.

Yes, Rufus, that's the way.  
  
Great design.   
  
It's the cream of the crop!  
  
Top-notch!  
  
...to be in, line with all points  
_(I have to solve this problem if I was a psychology major in those days - 20 years ago)._  
  
That's the right way how you have to develop your rational cognition, the subject of cognition if you intend to trade the forex more successfully.

See #[**1547**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4372553&postcount=1547)   
  
Think outside the Box  
  
Financial orientation - raw data  
Try to capitalize the bonanzas (daily win, daily profit) with 1:10, say if I make a daily profit around 9'000.-$ (Example 9'757.33$) so the minus input has to capitalize with 90'000.-$ (Example -77'734.22$) & the rest might be hedged.  
  
It's beneficial by compensate the -77'734.22$ with the "Equity" or "Free Margin" variable.  
  
So it's not necessary to think in aspects of drawdowns (may be 2% or 5% and close then your losses). No!, ...no!, ...no! Really the wrong way for my understanding of profit taking! Your daily profit is only a flipside, a reverse, a drawback of the risky trades of your losses, say the other side of a stastistical parameter of your probability calculation,...a fortiori (as much more) as 90% of all "2%-achievable-loss-trades" might be running in a win sooner or later, so you have to concentrate exclusively of the negligible quantity by 10%, say if you have 50 open trades you have to manage only 5 "more dangerous" trades a little longer. Think a little about it and make up your mind without indoctrinate me.

<http://www.weirdwarp.com/2009/08/paradox-or-not/>  
  
Paradox Or Not?  
  
Paradox is such a great looking word that I couldn’t resist it. I must be a little odd or should I say weird but I just love the X at the end and the way it sounds. Just don’t get me going about paradoxical! So what is a paradox?  
A paradox is a statement that contradicts itself. It is so much easier to give an example rather than a load of words. A classic is ” I always lie” if it is true then it must be false and is therefore a paradox. Also, which came first, the chicken  
  
[](http://www.weirdwarp.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Paradox-waterfall.jpg)[http://www.weirdwarp.com/wp-content/...ll-234x300.jpg](http://www.weirdwarp.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Paradox-waterfall-234x300.jpg)  
Waterfall Paradox  
  
or the egg? Space, time and the universe are full of paradoxes and just go to show how weird the place that we live in is.  
It has been said that there are no true paradoxes, only apparent ones. It is certainly the case that many paradoxes come about when language is badly applied to experience. These paradoxes show that our language must be looked at more carefully. Finding the “resolution” of a paradox means finding a way of talking about it so that it’s paradoxical nature vanishes.  
Here are a few paradoxes that I found particularly interesting.**  
**  
**Can Things Be Impossible For A God?**  
These paradoxes illustrate problems with omnipotence. Can God create an object too heavy for him to lift? Or, forgeting the physical problems entirely, can God ask a question too difficult for him to answer? And was that the question?  
This paradox treads on theological grounds, which brings in special problems of heresy and damnation. Either God cannot in fact do everything, or he can, but he chooses not to thus avoiding the problem.  
  
**Lets Make 2=5 Well Perhaps**  
Here is an example of a paradoxical mathematical proof. Several such proofs exist but all contain faults. The first line is taken as a given:

  1. A = B
  2. A+A = A+B (adding A to both sides)
  3. 2A = A+B (simplifying)
  4. 2A-2B = A+B-2B (subtracting 2B from both sides)
  5. 2A-2B = A-B (simplifying)
  6. 2(A-B) = 1(A-B) (factoring)
  7. 2 = 1 (cancelling)

Once it is established that 2=1, it is easy to prove that any other pair of numbers are equal simply by multiplying and adding appropriate numbers to both sides of the equation.’  
  
  
[](http://www.weirdwarp.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Square-Paradox.jpg)[http://www.weirdwarp.com/wp-content/...re-Paradox.jpg](http://www.weirdwarp.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Square-Paradox.jpg)  
Square Paradox  
  
Proofs’ like this always have a fallacy. The fallacy in this one is in the last step, when the (A-B) on both sides is cancelled. This is division by zero, which is illegal in mathematics. That’s a pity isn’t it I could have been a rich and famous man.  
  
**Zeno’s Paradoxes**  
[Zeno’s](http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Zeno_of_Elea.html) most popular paradox runs something like this, suppose you want to cross the room, first you have to walk halfway across, then you have to cross half the remaining distance, then half the remaining distance, and so on. There are, eventually an [infinite](http://www.answers.com/infinite) number of distances you have to cross to get across the room, and this is impossible to do in a finite time, therefore, all motion is impossible.  
  
The resolution of this paradox does not require calculus, It is only necessary to point out that Zeno has assumed that the distance across the room is infinitely divisible, but not infinitely extended. Therefore the time required to cross it must also be infinitely divisible, and it is not required that the time be infinitely extended. Whether space or time are actually infinitely divisible may be a problem in modern physics, but that’s way over Poor old Zeno’s head.  
  
**The Lying Cretin**  
This and the following several paradoxes rely on headache inducing phenomenon known as self-reference. The Lying [Cretin](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=cretin), like Zeno’s Paradoxes, comes to us from the Ancient Greeks. One version of the Lying Cretin paradox occurs in the Bible-  
“One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, slow bellies. This witness is true. Titus 1:12-13″  
  
  
[](http://www.weirdwarp.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Starbucks-paradox-.jpg)[http://www.weirdwarp.com/wp-content/...x--283x300.jpg](http://www.weirdwarp.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Starbucks-paradox--283x300.jpg)  
Starbucks paradox  
  
The prophet in question was Epimenides, who said “all Cretins are liars” when he was being interrogated by Athenians. The problem here is that if what he says is true, then he, a Cretin, is always a liar, so what he says is therefore false. There must, in fact, be at least one Cretin who is not a liar. This is not quite a paradox, it is just an odd way to lie. The writer’s claim that “this witness is true”, cannot be correct. Lying Cretans: 1 – the Apostle Paul: 0.  
  
**The Barber Paradox**  
In a certain town lives a barber who has a peculiar rule by which he operates. The barber cuts the hair of everyone who doesn’t cut their own hair, and he doesn’t cut the hair of anyone who does cut their own hair. Who cuts the barber’s hair?  
The resolution to this is that the barber is bald (Or he uses hair remover). Alternately, no barber can follow such a rule.  
  
**The Librarian Paradox**  
This one is a little tricky to follow; there is a chief librarian who is in charge of several libraries. He asks the librarians of each library to prepare for him, in book form, a catalogue of all of the books in their respective libraries. Each librarian is faced with a dilemma. Since the catalogue is a book, should it be included in the catalogue of books? Some decide yes, some decide no. When the chief librarian receives all of the catalogues, he divides them into two groups, those which list themselves, and those which don’t. There are many of each kind, and the chief librarian sets out to catalogue the catalogues.  
  
He prepares one catalogue which lists all catalogues which list themselves. Another lists all catalogues which do not list themselves. Where is this last catalogue to be listed? If it does not list itself, then it really should, but if it does, then it really shouldn’t.  
The resolution is simple; the librarian cannot make a catalogue according to the stated rule.  
  
**Newcomb’s Paradox**  
You are taking part in an experiment. In front of you on a table are two boxes, box A and box B. Box A is made of glass so you can see inside, and it contains £1000. Box B is opaque and contains either nothing or £1,000,000. You are  
  
  
[](http://www.weirdwarp.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Paradox-Sign.jpg)[http://www.weirdwarp.com/wp-content/...gn-300x180.jpg](http://www.weirdwarp.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Paradox-Sign-300x180.jpg)  
Paradox Sign  
  
allowed to take either box B alone, or both box A and box B.  
Here’s the catch, the people running the experiment claim to be able to predict with astounding accuracy which of the two options you will go for, and will have put the £1,000,000 in box B only if they predict that you will only take box B. If they think you will take both then they’ve left box B empty.  
In the previous thousand experiments like this, their predictions about what the subject will do have been correct… so, what do you do? No, don’t run away.  
  
One argument is that you’re just another subject, so if you take both boxes you get £1000, if you take just box B then you get £1,000,000. So take just box B.  
On the other hand, either the money is sitting there in box B or it’s not, so whatever is in box B, taking both means you get £1,000 more than if you take just box B.  
which box would you take?  
  
**Fermi’s Paradox**  
This Is a Very Well Known and common Paradox around the Internet and amongst alien conspiracists and organisations like [SETI.](http://www.seti.org/Page.aspx?pid=1345)  
Fermi realized that any civilization with a little rocket technology and a small amount of expansion ambition could rapidly colonize the entire Galaxy. Within ten million years, every star system could be colonised. Ten million years may sound long, but in fact it’s quite short compared with the age of the Galaxy, which is roughly ten thousand million years. This doesn’t seem to have happened.  
  
Fermi’s paradox asks, where are they?  
Drake’s equation shows that the galaxy should be colonised and makes us ask Fermi’s question once again. The equation is usually written:  
N = R* • fp • ne • fl • fi • fc • L  
Don’t let all those symbols confuse you, Drake’s equation is just a lot of different factors to do with the number of alien civilisations and the different things that would affect them multiplied together. These “things” are listed below.

  1. N = The number of civilisations in The Milky Way Galaxy whose electromagnetic emissions are detectable.
  2. R* =The rate of formation of stars suitable for the development of intelligent life.
  3. fp = The fraction of those stars with planetary systems.
  4. ne = The number of planets, per solar system, with an environment suitable for life.
  5. fl = The fraction of suitable planets on which life actually appears.
  6. fi = The fraction of life bearing planets on which intelligent life emerges.
  7. fc = The fraction of civilizations that develop a technology that releases detectable signs of their existence into space.
  8. L = The length of time such civilizations release detectable signals into space.

So Drake’s equation says there should be loads of aliens and Fermi’s paradox says well where are they Mr Drake??

**Olber’s Paradox**  
Why is the night sky dark? The universe is rather big, well, we could call it infinite which means, we will say, that there are infinite stars. All those stars and all that light produced by those stars should fill up the night sky with light. But It doesn’t, does it?  
  
  
[](http://www.weirdwarp.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/3d-Tic-Tac-Toe.jpg)[http://www.weirdwarp.com/wp-content/...oe-300x219.jpg](http://www.weirdwarp.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/3d-Tic-Tac-Toe-300x219.jpg)  
3d Tic Tac Toe  
  
This paradox has been around a long time and a few explanations have occurred. [De Chesaux ](http://en.allexperts.com/e/j/je/jean-philippe_de_cheseaux.htm)and [Lord Kelvin](http://www.todayinsci.com/K/Kelvin_Lord/Kelvin_Lord.htm) (who gave his name to the temperature scale) suggested that there might be dust in between us and many of the stars, blocking out the light that we receive from them. However, absorbing dust would eventually cause an equilibrium, and emit as much radiation as it absorbed. Even if it was at a different wavelength, we would still receive the same amount of light as before.  
Some astronomers thought that if the universe was expanding (as good old Hubble showed that it is) light from distant stars could be redshifted by the Doppler effect. While this effect provides a contribution, it doesn’t account for enough light to darken the entire sky, the left overs should still be detectable.  
  
[Benoit Mandelbrot](http://info.math.nankai.edu.cn/mirror/www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/Mathematicians/Mandelbrot.html) suggested that there is fractal distribution of galaxies. This would mean that there was a lot of empty spaces between stars, and galaxies, so the light coming from each direction would not add up to infinity.  
  
[The real explanation to Ober’s paradox](http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1989JBAA...99...10W&amp;data_type=PDF_HIGH&amp;whole_paper=YES&amp;type=PRINTER&amp;filetype=.pdf) is that light takes time to travel and therefore it hasn’t reached us yet and by the time all the light does reach us, the stars will have died and others will have been born so the light can never make the nights day.  
  
**EPR Paradox And Schrodinger Cat**  
I have covered these both before in a [quantum physics post](http://www.weirdwarp.com/2009/05/blow-up-your-brain-with-quantum-physics-or-perhaps-not/).  
  
The EPR Paradox is a paradox that was first suggested by Einstein who proposed a thought experiment that appeared to demonstrate quantum mechanics to be an incomplete theory.  
  
**Grandfather Paradox**  
Although a bit morbid, it demonstrates an interesting conundrum. If you had access to a time machine, what would happen if you traveled back in time and (let’s hope) accidentally killed Grandpa? What would happen to you? Your parents? Your kids?  
  
**Bilking Paradox**  
This violates causality all over the place, it is an assertion of free will which transcends the functionality of time travel. It is best explained by example, a man builds a time machine from plans he received from a mysterious person years before. The man realizes that the stranger was himself, using the time machine to travel back and give the plans to his younger self.  
A bilking paradox would occur if the man built the machine, tested its reliability, and then refused to give himself the plans.  
Interesting and mind bending, paradoxes keep us thinking. From [Catch-22](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0099477319?ie=UTF8&tag=techseller05-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0099477319)[http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t...2&a=0099477319](http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=techseller05-21&l=as2&o=2&a=0099477319) “a concern for one’s own safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind”.  
In this novel, this meant that an airman might be crazy and could be grounded, all he had to do was ask. But if he did ask, he was deemed sane and so had to keep flying. He might be crazy to fly more missions, and sane if he didn’t – but if he was sane, he had to fly them. I expect this will not be airmen one day but spacemen.

1\. I read your demo trading statement from 11.05th~11.12.2010, and that was beautiful, dude. With no more than 2 Vols per trade, the TCT sytem generated big profit and enabled you to catch 380 pips within 2 days!!. Awsome! This attracts me a lot.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)   
  
2\. May I ask a question that when you enter a position after the CCI or Bollinger bands sounds a signal, you enter when the candle(such as. H1,h4) is forming or wait the candle is closed?   
  
3\. Have you done some statistics about the winning percentage of the TCT? And Could you please share it for us? :-)  
  
I am stilling puzzling about where to entry. It's the biggest obstacle on my way to profiting with your wonderful trading system (Sorry for my awful English.)

Hi hotjoey  
  
I think in terms of probabilities, in likelihoods at most of my time when I make up a mind about the selection of currency-pairs (1st step). CCI(14) filtered out the best ones clearly, fast & effectively. CCI(14) gives a fast optical orientation when I will make the time-consuming currency MTF analyzes in the sequel.  
  
I-Fractals has been only used for an optical support (when the charts are published) in hindsight. It could be that it repaint the things at the chart. I wouldn't to attach too much importance on it. You can use just as well "Insert" > "Channels" > "Standard Deviation" in combination with the CCI(14) in order to obtain more powerful arguments for your trade decision.   
  
If I would explain now the impact of chaos theory in combination with the probability theory, the CCI(14) & MM's I think I need a day for explaining it in detail. It can't be possible that you will lodge this claim.  
  
Kindest regards  
FXcube

I try to take the risk with some enter shorts at 29.19 (4 positions)  
Target: 28.50 (S2 28.47 & crosspoint of EMA 50/100/200) / 27.00 (27.344 Murrey Math, "Pivot Reverse" [+2/8]) / Long Term: 24.25 (24.21 "Overshoot" [-1/8]), 23.25 (EMA50)  
  
Further upside movements should be hedged.

USDCHF, Monthly, 2011 February 07  
  
  
Odds are given that the EMA200 could be broken at H4 with regard to the weekly and monthly charts for getting a more global view and more powerful arguments by trading the CCI(14) Tops & Bottoms.  
  
Trade the M1(or with EURUSD see #[**1581**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4376938&postcount=1581))/M5/M15/M30 in the meantime and take the risk over with some enter longs at 0.9565 (see #[**1578**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4376832&postcount=1578), please)  
  
M30: Be aware of the first shooting star (Gravestone Doji) at M30 #[**1579**](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4376848&postcount=1579), so hedge several downs. (The second candle isn't fully formed because the time isn't up).

USDCHF, M30, 2011 February 07  
  
You could often see such a typicall market situation at smaller timeframes (here M30) if at higher charts (daily, weekly, monthly) could the market develop a breakout.  
  
May be we'll see that the market price could struggling around with little ups and little downs before will turning in a bigger trend (up or down). We don't know!  
  
I'll trade with TCT some longs up (long term) and short downs (short term) in the meantime before a bigger trend at the higher timeframes will shape.

TCT could be used with some time lag "hedge"-positions by using it in combination with the Pivotals and sometimes **with** the standard deviation (Insert > Channel > Standard Deviation) and with the Multiple Time Frame Analyses and most often without stop loss.  
  
May be I'll post some examples the next days or weeks. I don't know because it's time-consuming!

Forex Trading - Standard Deviation a Powerful Tool For Bigger Profits  
By [Sacha Tarkovsky](http://ezinearticles.com/?expert=Sacha_Tarkovsky)  
  
In Forex trading most new traders don't understand the concept of standard deviation. However if you understand it, you can gain greater insight into price movement and a huge edge in your quest for profits.Let's look at standard deviation in greater detail.  
Standard deviation may seem a bit confusing at first, but it's totally logical.  
Let's do the technical bit first and then look at why it is so important at the end of this article.  
  
  
What is it?  
Standard deviation is a statistical term that provides an indication of the volatility of any price and that includes forex prices. It measures how widely values (closing prices) are dispersed from the average. Dispersion is the difference between the actual value (closing price) and the average value (mean closing price). The larger the difference between the closing prices and the average price, the higher the standard deviation will be and therefore the volatility of the market. The closer the closing prices are to the average mean price, the lower the standard deviation and the volatility of the currency is. It is calculated by taking the square root of the variance, the average of the squared deviations from the mean.  
High Standard Deviation values occur when the data item being analyzed is changing dramatically. On the other hand, low Standard Deviation values occur when prices are more stable. Major tops and bottoms are accompanied by high volatility as investors reflect the psychology of euphoria, greed and fear.  
  
  
Why it is so useful?  
All short term price spikes in financial markets that move to far from the mean price are unsustainable and are a reflection of human psychology.  
The emotions of greed and fear are at work and eventually prices will move back toward the mean.  
  
  
Keep this equation in mind:  
Supply and demand fundamentals + investor psychology = Price movement.  
A big rise in volatility away from the mean is a spike normally driven by emotion.  
  
  
If you can spot this you have a tool to take profits if you are trading in the direction of the move or make a great contrary trade against the volatility.  
How to apply standard deviation easily.  
  
  
If you understand standard deviation you can use it to your advantage.  
  
  
A great way is to incorporate Bollinger bands in your trading and we will look at them in more detail in next article.

[http://www.forexrealm.com/technical-...deviation.html](http://www.forexrealm.com/technical-analysis/technical-indicators/standard-deviation.html)  
  
**Standard Deviation** measures volatility statistically. It shows the difference of the values from the average one. The volatility as well as the standard deviation gets higher if the closing prices and average closing prices differ considerably. If the difference is insignificant the standard deviation and the volatility are low.  
The reversals of trends such as bottoms or tops of the market are timed by high volatility levels. The new trends of prices growth after some recessive period are sometimes timed by low volatility levels.  
The square root taken from the variance which is the average from mean squared deviations forms the Standard Deviation calculation.  
The considerable change of the data under analysis, such as indicator or prices, gives High Standard Deviation values. Stable prices form low Standard Deviation values accordingly.  
The most considerable tops are thought to go along with the significant volatility that occurs due to processes of fear and euphoria of investors. Considerable lows don't give much profit expectations, that's why they generally pass calmer.

Two lines which are parallel to the Linear Regression Trendline correspond the **Standard Deviation Channel**. Their distance from LTR are x standard deviations.  
  
Prices movement from tops to bottoms is objective. New highs are created when the optimism of the market participants increases. New lows become the result of the market participants' pessimism accordingly.  
Markets are supposed to have the pricing point being equilibrium. The **Standard Deviation Channel** gives the sign of extremes falling in the same way as Linear Regression Trendline shows an equilibrium point.  
The position of the point on the graph which is one standard deviation above and below the LRT falls in 67% cases according to statistics. Two standard deviations increase gives the 95% possibility for the data do decrease between these lines.

The distance between the price of a security and Linear Regression Trendline gives the basis to measure **Standard Error**. The trend is as strong, as close the price is to the Linear Regression Trendline. The higher the distance is, the weaker and less reliable trend is due to the high standard error.  
High price volatility is indicated by high values of **Standard Error**. Trend modification is followed by an immediate standard error growth.  
The combination of this indicator and the R-Squared is widely used. R-Squared decrease along with Standard Error generally forecast trend changes. The unusual values trending to a converging are the sign of change.  
Still a downward movement from the top is not the only direction of the trend change as far as sideways fluctuations are supposed to be the change either.

[http://www.forexrealm.com/technical-...ror-bands.html](http://www.forexrealm.com/technical-analysis/technical-indicators/standard-error-bands.html)  
  
The basis of **Standard Error Bands** is standard error levels located higher or lower than Linear Regression Indicator. Standard Error Bands developed by Jon Anderson are the variation of envelope. That's why their outlook is close to Bollinger Bands though their calculation differs. The plotting of Bollinger Bands is made a standard deviation higher or lower than a moving average, whether the lines drawn below or above linear regression plot are Standard Error Bands.  
  
  
The recommendations of Andersen are following values: the number of periods is "21", smoothing at a 3-day simple moving average, standard errors: "2". Another note is that unreliable results are made by taking short time frames.  
  
  
[http://www.forexrealm.com/forex-imag...derr-bands.png](http://www.forexrealm.com/forex-images/technical-indicators/stderr-bands.png)   
  
Standard Error of the security gives the ground for **Standard Error Bands** spacing. That's why the reliable trend can be seen when the distance between the bands is very tight. Wide fluctuations and price volatility is expected when the distance is big. The increasing distance after being small is the sign of the trend losing its strength and a possible reversal.  
  
  
\- Strong trend is indicated by tight bands.  
\- Wide distance between prices gives the freedom for prices fluctuations.  
\- Increasing distance between bands can be the sign of trend weakening and possible reversal.  
\- Prices follow the direction of the bands reversed after the lost trend.  
\- Standard Error Bands makes a good combination with the r-squared indicator. A reliable trend existence is confirmed by high r-squared value along with low bands' distance. A combination of low r-squared value and wide bands' distance shows the trend weakening.  
  
  
Generally speaking, the trend and its volatility are attempted to be shown by Standard Error Bands. This indicator gets resulted in 3 plots. The linear regression line showing the 21-period ending value is the middle one.  
Two standard errors added to the regression line's ending value result in the upper standard error band (the upper plot).  
  
  
The subtraction of two standard errors from the linear regression line's end value creates the lower standard error band (the lower plot). Closing price may greatly influence the line values as well as error bands. That's why it's necessary to draw the three bar (period) simple moving average of the ending value of the regression line and the standard errors.  
  
  
Standard Error Bands have much in common with Bollinger bands, though their interpretation differs. Trend directions along with its volatility are represented by Standard Error Bands whether the indication of Bollinger bands is average plotted price volatility.  
  
  
One of the usage tactics of Standard Error Bands is monitoring the distance reduction at the moment of both upward and downward price movements. An easy price trend is supposed to occur in case this situation takes place. A strong trend keeps the bands at the close distance. The Linear Regression follows the increasing or decreasing trend direction. The price reduction is indicated by widening Bands. A trend completion may be signalized by the following Linear Regression decrease.

Standard Deviation - Why it's So Important for Forex Traders  
  
Standard deviation is a concept all Forex traders should understand as part of their Forex education. In fact if you don’t understand it and know how to factor it into your trading strategy you are unlikely to win long term. Let’s look at it. Standard deviation is logical, easy to understand and will help you time entries better and define targets for trades, as well as spotting important trend reversals.  
It’s a simple and powerful concept and all forex traders should know how it works and how to take advantage of it.  
The real problem that traders have to overcome when trading forex is overcoming volatile price moves that can stop them out to soon or with losses – if you learn how to deal with standard deviation, you will enter with better risk reward and get stopped out less often.  
What is standard deviation?  
  
Standard deviation is a statistical term that refers to and shows the volatility of price in any currency. In essence standard deviation measures how widely values are dispersed from the mean or average.  
  
Dispersion is effectively the difference between the actual closing value price and the average value or mean closing price.  
The larger the difference between the closing prices from the average price, the higher the standard deviation and volatility of the currency is. On the other hand - the closer the closing prices are to the average mean price, the lower the standard deviation or volatility of the currency is.  
  
Technical Calculation  
Here is the technical bit don’t worry if you find it a little complicated we will simplify things in a minute – here is the calculation:  
Standard deviation the square root of the variance, and the average of the squared deviations from the mean.  
High Standard Deviation is present when the price of the currency studied is changing volatile and has large daily ranges. On the other hand, low Standard Deviation values take places when currencies are range trading or in consolidation i.e. when prices are more stable and less volatile.  
  
Spotting Big Contrary trades  
Major tops and bottoms and important trend changes are accompanied by high volatility as prices reflect the psychology of the participants and greed and fear push prices away from the fundamentals.  
If you look at any forex chart you will see price spikes caused by human emotion and they are not sustainable and prices tend to return to more realistic levels after periods of high volatility – you will often here the term blow off top or bottom where prices make one last volatile surge and reverse.  
  
3 Important Ways to Use Standard Deviation  
So how can you incorporate standard deviation in your forex trading? The answer is it is useful for:  
1\. Picking important market tops or bottoms i.e look for highly volatile prices that have spiked to far from the mean.  
2\. Targeting entries within trends - if for example, prices spike away from the mean to far, they will fall back to the average eventually. If the trend is strong you can target entry at the mean price.  
3\. If prices are trading in a narrow range and suddenly high standard deviation pushes prices away from the mean, you can trade with the break.  
  
If you want an easy tool to apply to help you apply standard deviation in your trading - looking no further than the Bollinger band. Most major chart services plot it and its easy to use – we don’t have time to explain it all here so see our other articles.  
  
The Real Enemy for Traders  
Is not picking trend direction, it’s entering with the best risk reward and dealing with volatility if you have understanding of standard deviation you will be able to deal with the enemy of volatility, harness and control it, and use it to achieve currency trading success.

Hi yaed  
  
It's a great idea, but I don't think that some traders will give you the respect without due care for it.  
  
I have sent you a PM.  
  
Another great idea could be that several traders are open a private real account (everyone for himself) with a small deposit (so hackers shouldn't be interested in it) and publish the results at myfxbook.com.   
  
Otherwise you can count me in there, please.   
  
Kindest regards

Scalping Example   
M1-Trading  
EURUSD, M1, 2011 February 09  
  
The charts M1, M5, M15,M30 & H1 have signaling a CCI(14) Top in combination with a pivotal point (DR1 1.3686), which seems for me some powerful arguments of an acceptable likelihood to go in the market with some enter short (short term orders) for a few minutes with higher risk (lot sizes), ... and you have to go out like the clappers due to the fact that H4 & Daily chart candles could move further upwards.   
  
Profit: 3'500.-$ ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
Note: If you intend to trade the whole day long at M1 you'll loose all your money!

The same here as described the method before.  
  
The Market Price has moved further up till the next pivotal point mR2 1.3715.  
  
Enter some shorts at M1 and go out as soon as you can.

If the shooting star wil be broken further upwards then it could be better to exit (or hedge), but H4, Daily & Weekly gives more argument for a down.

Hello forexcube  
I looked on the GBPUSD on a more senior taymfrey and decided to set a conservative target at 1.6046 and at 0.50 opened a lot of that, however much it safe

Hi Gregory  
  
Really nice charts!  
  
Keep up the good work!  
  
The market price could go further up till 1.6870 since weekly CCI(14) isn't exactly at it's top. If so I'll trigger several M15 longs in the meantime.  
  
I wish you success & happiness!  
  
Best regards  
FXcube

****Welcome to John Bollinger's technical analysis and Bollinger Bands Forex website!****  
  
Bollinger Bands are a technical trading tool created by John Bollinger in the early 1980s. They arose from the need for adaptive trading bands and the observation that volatility was dynamic, not static as was widely believed at the time.   
  
The purpose of Bollinger Bands is to provide a relative definition of high and low. By definition prices are high at the upper band and low at the lower band. This definition can aid in rigorous pattern recognition and is useful in comparing price action to the action of indicators to arrive at systematic trading decisions.  
  
Over the past two decades, thousands of traders using technical analysis have come to view Bollinger Bands as a most reliable tool for assessing expected price action. Forex traders have been using Bollinger Bands for years, but this is the only website dedicated to providing Bollinger Band analytics for the forex market.  
  
For in depth understanding of Bollinger Bands and to get the most from this website we recommend you read John Bollinger's book "[Bollinger on Bollinger Bands](http://www.bollingerbands.com/products/?type=book)"

Basic Patterns  
  
  
This section will cover some **basic candlestick patterns** , but first you should become familiar with some basic candlestick terms.  
  
[http://www.forexrealm.com/forex-imag...c-patterns.gif](http://www.forexrealm.com/forex-images/candlesticks/basic-patterns.gif)  
  
A long candle is a very long body when compared to other most recent candles.  
A short candle is of course, just the opposite and usually indicates consolidation. It occurs when trading was confined to a narrow range during the period. The term white bodies refer to periods of extreme buying pressure.  
Black bodies refer to just the opposite, period of extreme selling pressures.  
  
**Long Days Pattern**  
  
Candlesticks in a **long days pattern** are shorter than the actual body. They indicate the large differences between the price at the time the market opened for the day and the price at which is closed.

**Short Days Pattern**  
  
Candlesticks in **short day patterns** will be short lines within a short body. These lines represent the minimal changes between prices at the time the market opened for the day and the price at closing.

Marubozu Pattern**  
  
A **Marubozu pattern** indicates that there are no shadows present in the bodies.  
A White Marubozu is represented by a long white body that doesn't contain any shadows. It's usually the first indication of a bullish trend, but can indicate the trend will continue or reverse.  
  
[http://www.forexrealm.com/forex-imag...e-marubozu.gif](http://www.forexrealm.com/forex-images/candlesticks/white-marubozu.gif)  
A Black Marubozu is represented with a long black body and generally indicates a bearish continuation period or reversal pattern.

**Spinning Tops Pattern  
  
**When the shadows are longer than the body itself, it's referred to as a **Spinning Tops pattern**. In this type of market pattern, the color of the body isn't actually important. The pattern is an indication that there is a lot of indecision between the bearish and bullish market trends.

Stars and Rain Drops Patterns**, along with reversal patterns are some of the more complicated patterns in the market.  
A **Star pattern** forms whenever a small body peaks above the long body of the previous market day.

Continuation Patterns  
  
In the candlestick theory, there are two main patterns that are **continuous** , the **Falling Three Methods** and the **Rising Three Methods**.  
**Falling Three Methods**  
  
A long black black day will occur in a downward trend and be followed by three days of small real bodies that create a short upward trend. However, by the fifth day, the bears will step in rather strongly and cause the market to close at a new low rate. This small upward trend that occurs between two long black days reflects the consistent behavior of the investors taking a small break. This downward trend will usually continue for a time. It denotes a bearish trend and has a high rate of reliability.  
  
[http://www.forexrealm.com/forex-imag...ee-methods.gif](http://www.forexrealm.com/forex-images/candlesticks/falling-three-methods.gif)  
  
1) The first day will be a long black day.  
2) The second, third, and fourth days that follow will have small real bodies. The rates will remain within the range of the beginning day and will follow a brief period of an upward trend.  
3) The fifth day is a long black day. When the market closes on this day, it will close at rates that are below the rates the market closed with on the first day.  
  
**Rising Three Methods**  
During an upward trend, a long white day will occur that is followed with three days in which small real bodies have fallen into a short downward trend. Again, this trend is indicative of the investors taking a small break. At the close of the fifth day, the market will close at a new high rate, this results when because the bulls have came in strong. This method also indicates a bullish trend and has a high reliability rate.  
  
[http://www.forexrealm.com/forex-imag...ee-methods.gif](http://www.forexrealm.com/forex-images/candlesticks/rising-three-methods.gif)   
  
1) The first day will be a long white day.  
2) The second, third, and fourth days that follow small real bodies. The rates reflect a brief downward trend, but still remain within the range that the market had on the first day.  
3) The fifth day is a long white day. At closing time on this day, the market will have rates that are above those on the first day of closing.

Reversal Patterns  
  
[http://www.forexrealm.com/technical-...tterns-01.html](http://www.forexrealm.com/technical-analysis/graphical-methods/candlestick-patterns/reversal-patterns-01.html)  
  
There are also several types of **reversal candlestick patterns** within Forex trading, as defined below.

  1. Dark Cloud Cover
  2. Engulfing
  3. Evening Star
  4. Harami
  5. Morning Star Doji
  6. Piercing Line
  7. Three Black Crows
  8. Three White Soldiers

**Dark Cloud Cover Pattern**  
  
During an upward trend in the market gaps will begin to open, but they are not stable and will lose ground falling below the midpoint of the market the previous day. This pattern indicates the opportunity for investors to capitalize at the opening of the market the next day. This is actually a warning sign for bullish investors. This candlestick pattern is the exact opposite of the Piercing Line pattern. This pattern indicates a bullish trend and has a high reliability rate.  
  
[http://www.forexrealm.com/forex-imag...loud-cover.gif](http://www.forexrealm.com/forex-images/candlesticks/dark-cloud-cover.gif)

  1. A white body followed by a black body.
  2. The black body passes the midpoint of the prior white body.
  3. This candlestick pattern occurs in an uptrend.

**Engulfing Pattern**  
  
This pattern occurs when a candle body of the days market completely engulfs the body of the previous day. There are also several engulfing patterns, white engulfing candles are bullish, black engulfing candles are bearish. A **bullish engulfing** commonly occurs when there are short term bottoms and a **bearish engulfing** will occur when the market is at the top. Many of the other candlesticks, such as Dojis, Hammers and Hanging Man, require the confirmation that a trend change has occurred that follows an engulfing pattern. This pattern indicates a bullish trend and has a high reliability rate.  
  
[http://www.forexrealm.com/forex-imag.../engulfing.gif](http://www.forexrealm.com/forex-images/candlesticks/engulfing.gif)   
  
When engulfing occurs in a downward trend, it indicates that the the trend has lost momentum and bullish investors may be getting stronger.  
  
[http://www.forexrealm.com/forex-imag...-engulfing.gif](http://www.forexrealm.com/forex-images/candlesticks/bullish-engulfing.gif)

  1. The first day's color indicates the trend of the trading day.
  2. The second real body should have the opposite color of the first real body.
  3. The second day's body should completely engulf the previous day's body.

When **engulfing** occurs during an upward trend, it indicates the market will open with a new high. This high will be followed by a high volume of sell-offs, that result in the day closing at or below that of the previous days opening. This indicates that the upward trend has suffered and became weak and the bearish investors may be gaining some strength in the market. This pattern indicates a bullish trend, but has only a moderate rate of reliability..  
  
[http://www.forexrealm.com/forex-imag...-engulfing.gif](http://www.forexrealm.com/forex-images/candlesticks/bearish-engulfing.gif)

  1. The first day's color indicates the trend of the trading day.
  2. The second real body should have the opposite color of the first real body.
  3. The second day's body should completely engulf the previous day's body.

Single Candle Patterns  
  
There are some types of **single candle patterns** in candlesticks' theory. They are the following: 

  1. Dragonfly Doji
  2. Gravestone Doji
  3. Hammers/ Hanging Man
  4. Hollow Red Candles
  5. Filled Black Candles

**Doji's**  
  
[http://www.forexrealm.com/forex-imag...ticks/doji.gif](http://www.forexrealm.com/forex-images/candlesticks/doji.gif)  
**Doji's** are reversal candlesticks that are formed when the market opens and closes at the same level. This pattern indicates there is a lot of indecision in the prices of stock. Depending on how long the shadows are and where they're located, Doji's can be divided into different formations such as Doji, long legged Doji, butterfly, gravestone and the 4 price Doji.  
Doji's become more significant to the market when they appear after and extended period of long bodied candles, whether they are bullish or bearish and is confirmed with an engulfing. They follow a bullish trend and only have a moderate rate of reliability.  
**Long-legged Doji**  
  
A **long legged Doji candlestick** forms when the stocks open and close prices remain the same. This Doji is much more powerful if it is preceded by small candles. It indicates a sudden burst of popularity in a stock that previously hasn't been very popular, thus can imply the beginning of a change in trend.  
**Dragonfly Doji**  
  
**Dragonfly Doji's** are Doji's that opened high in the market, experienced a notable decline, but received enough support to close at the same price at which it opened. They are often seen after there has been a moderate decline and when they are confirmed with a bullish engulfing, they are indicators of a bottom reversal. Dragonfly Doji's indicate a bullish trend that offers moderate reliability.  
  
The Dragonfly Doji has a higher reliability rate associated with it than the Hammer does.

  1. The long lower shadow is about two to three times the size of the real body.
  2. There is very little upper shadow, or none at all.
  3. The real body is at the upper end of the trading range.
  4. The color of the real body is not important.

**Gravestone Doji**  
  
**Gravestone Doji's** are the opposite of the Dragonfly Doji and when confirmed with a bearish engulfing, are the top indicators for a reversal. Appropriately named, they look like gravestone's and could forecast doom for the stock. When the stock opens and closes at the same level after Forex trading, it's referred to as 4 price Doji's. This very rarely occurs and is generally only evident with securities that are thinly traded. This is a bullish trend that provides investors with moderate reliability.  
  
  
[http://www.forexrealm.com/forex-imag...stone-dogi.gif](http://www.forexrealm.com/forex-images/candlesticks/gravestone-dogi.gif)

  1. Small real body at the upper end of the trading range.
  2. Upper shadow usually at least three times as long as the real body.
  3. Very little lower shadow or none at all.

**Whipsaw**  
  
[http://i.investopedia.com/inv/092009.../book_icon.jpg](http://i.investopedia.com/inv/092009/dictionary/book_icon.jpg)  
**What Does _Whipsaw_ Mean?**  
A condition where a security's price heads in one direction, but then is followed quickly by a movement in the opposite direction. The origins of term is derived from the push and pull action used by lumberjacks to cut wood with a type of saw with the same name.

**Investopedia explains _Whipsaw_**  
There are two types of whipsaw patterns. The first involves an upward movement in the share price, which is then followed by a drastic downward move, which causes the share's price to fall relative to its original position. The second type involves the share price to drop for a little while, and then suddenly, the price abruptly surges towards positive gains relative to the stock's original position.

[http://www.forexforays.com/2007/01/w...fake-outs.html](http://www.forexforays.com/2007/01/whipsaws-and-fake-outs.html)  
  
Whipsaws and Fake-outs    
  
Some of the most frustrating and costly market phenomena a trader is likely to see are whipsaws and fake-outs. Actually these are pretty much the same thing, with the difference that calling it a fake-out attributes a negative intention to the market, essentially accusing it of messing with your head. And a whipsaw or fake-out can indeed have a serious impact on your confidence in yourself and your trading system. If you spend your days looking for price break-outs and trends and instead you get a string of these nasty up-and-down spikes, you may wonder why you got into trading in the first place. The past couple weeks have been a vivid case-study in whipsaws and fake-outs, which is why they seemed like a good topic for today.  
  
So what is a whipsaw/fake-out, exactly? It's a point in the market where the price moves dramatically up or down, and in the early stages may look identical to the start of a new trend. Then, instead of continuing the trend or leveling off, it'll suddenly dive back down (or up, in the case of a downward spike) to a price close to where it started. If you've watched forex charts for any length of time, they've almost certainly crossed your path. But if you're new to the currency markets, or aren't sure exactly how to spot one, here are a couple from the past week's EUR/USD market.  
  
[](http://www.forexforays.com/uploaded_images/Whipsaw-EURUSD-UpDown-719489.JPG)[http://www.forexforays.com/uploaded_...own-717104.JPG](http://www.forexforays.com/uploaded_images/Whipsaw-EURUSD-UpDown-717104.JPG)  
[](http://www.forexforays.com/uploaded_images/Whipsaw-EURUSD-Down-755663.JPG)[http://www.forexforays.com/uploaded_...own-753234.JPG](http://www.forexforays.com/uploaded_images/Whipsaw-EURUSD-Down-753234.JPG)What causes them? Well, almost by definition they are points when there is insufficient momentum in a particular direction to sustain a trend. Because market sentiment is ambivalent, divided fairly evenly between longs and shorts, the price is unable to continue its break-out and falls back to where it started. If you've placed your limit/take-profit orders at an optimistic price point in anticipation of a strong trend, you're likely to find the whipsaw comes nowhere near them and lands you back within a few pips of your entry price, and a few pips poorer thanks to spread costs.  
  
The most dangerous whipsaws include price spikes in both directions, which after convincing you to place a trade in the direction of the first spike, then turn around and take out your stop-losses with the second spike.  
  
If we broaden the definition a little bit, [stop-hunting](http://www.forexforays.com/2006/05/so-whats-stop-hunting-exactly.html) could be considered a type of whipsaw that's staged by a broker within their own trading platform with the specific goal of hitting their clients' stop-loss orders. If you see a whipsaw on your broker's charts but not on anyone else's, chances are you got stop-hunted.  
  
That's not to say you can't make money on a garden-variety whipsaw or fake-out; I have no idea if it's [possible](http://www.forexforays.com/2006/11/can-traders-ever-profit-from-stop.html) during stop-hunting. If you're good at identifying markets in which they're likely to emerge (like the current one), you can adjust your trading strategy accordingly by placing your limit orders at levels closer to the entry price than you would in a trending market. You might also try combining these more modest limit orders with a tight trailing stop to help prevent all your profits evaporating when the price suddenly changes direction.  
  
Or, if you're like me and find whipsaws and fake-outs too nervewracking, unpredictable, and costly to play with, you can work on filtering them out of your trading by avoiding market conditions when they occur. In my experience these tend to be in range-bound markets with low volatility and little notable economic news to fuel a true break-out. I'm sure someone out there is getting rich off these things, but it's definitely not me!Labels: [Errors](http://www.forexforays.com/search/label/Errors), [Risks](http://www.forexforays.com/search/label/Risks), [Whipsaws](http://www.forexforays.com/search/label/Whipsaws)

**What is the best time of day to trade the EURO/USD**  
  
by admin on September 30, 2010  
  
**Q: What is the best time of day to trade the EURO/USD, and, are there other currency pairs best trading hours somewhat the same as the EURO/USD?**  
A: This all really depends on you. Do you want to trade UK, European & U.S.A Sessions? Or do you just want to trade UK or USA Trading sessions? Each session lasts approximately the same. Generally trading opens when the stock market opens in the US, but trading in the UK Starts at approximately 3AM EST (8AM GMT). European Sessions open 1 hour later, at 9AM GMT and close One Hour later after UK Session. UK closes around 5PM GMT. Some days earlier by an hour or two.  
Which hours / sessions do I trade? Well, to be honest, when ever I’m at the PC, some days I try to trade the UK Session as this session seems to be the fastest session out both the UK & US Session.  
As some of you may know, my hours are all messed up! Welcome to the world of trading Forex…lol  
I’ll find myself awake at 2am ready to trade the UK Session, and I may trade all the way through or at least keep my eyes peeled on previous trades that were open for a day or so, all the way into the late evening. Then you might find me saying “Hello, Morning all” on Skype, at 4pm cos I’ve just woke up…lol  
Now as in which currency pair is my preferred pair to trade?  
Well, what’s good for the Gander is not necessarily good for the Goose.  
However, I do recommend for the time being to just concentrate on the EUR/USD as this tends to move slower than GBP/USD and faster than USD/JPY and a fair amount of pips can be made on the EUR/USD and a perfect pair to practice on to get in early on a trade. Once you master how to get into the EUR/USD at the right time, you can be looking at around 120-200 pips for that day!  
This takes time to master. I’m finding that my Students get in at the right time, make a nice amount, ie, 40-60 pips, but jump out too soon. But hey, one has to learn to crawl before one walks, right? When you feel you want to spend less time analyzing the markets, practice on finding those longer pip gains. Set your take profits and stop losses appropriately, and sit back and let it rip!  
Study any reactions in the market, why, if at any time, your stop loss was triggered. Was it because you didn’t take all the aspects of Technical Analysis into consideration? Or did you set your Stop Loss too close to the opening price.  
Personally, I set my Stop losses to around 150 pips. This will cater for any fundamental news that can cause a Whip-Saw / Spike, a whip-saw is a huge move the other way of the general anticipation of it’s current direction your trade is going in; down or up.  
You can also try practicing using the Trailing stop too. I’d set this quite high, to around 650-750 points, which is equivalent to 65-75 pips. Once your trade is in profit by this amount, the stop loss will be raised for AUTOMATICALLY! So even if the trade did come down by approx 30 pips and hit your stop loss, there’s no worries cos it’s already booked in those 65-75 pips. [http://forexcourse.ultimategoldencro...icon_smile.gif](http://forexcourse.ultimategoldencross.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)   
Moving on. Have you noticed the AUD/USD? This is one of my favorite pairs…  
Why?  
Well, spend a day or so, just flipping back to your trading chart windows with the Aussie Dollar in action. Don’t worry about trading it. Just watch it. Watch as the EUR/USD & GBP/USD goes up, yup, the AUD/USD goes up with it, but this is not what I’m asking. Notice something?  
If you did notice this, then well done! Notice how the GBP/USD and EUR/USD goes up, or goes down and the AUD/USD follows it, but how there’s less sporadicity going on. When the AUD/USD goes up or goes down, it keeps going in that direction with hardly any pull back / retracement like you will see with other major currency pairs. It’s also a slow mover too, but once it goes in that direction by say, 50 pips from a previous low, or a previous high on its way back down… LOOK OUT! This puppy can pull in those dollars big time!

H4 & Daily are showing a CCI(14) Bottom with a daily divergence. Might be there're a good likelihood that the market price could pullback to the weekly's middle line of Bollinger Band.

Hi marx85  
  
I don't have read excellent money management books since today and I have read many of these but no one of these could reflect my kind of trading in a realistical way. What a pity? May be I will write a MM/RM Book once time for advanced level traders.  
  
Money Management  
Formula: Capitalize-the-risk-ratio  
A daily profit about +30'183.30$ needs a capitalize-to-risk-ratio around 1:10 without any kind of stop loss trading, instead of the risk-to-reward-ratio of 3:1 or 2:1 or so by trading the 2% stop loss rule. So I have to manage the "equity" or the "free margin" position around 300'000.-$ in plus (10 times more then the daily win). My personality and my trading concept (say all the corpus rationale of my fx-experience) allows to make a risk definition over the daily win positions. May be it sounds stupid in one form or another, for me it's an intelligent cognition, simple, efficient & profitable.   
  
It's very hard to use any form of Position Size Calculator (like <http://www.earnforex.com/position-size-calculator>), that lets you to calculate the size of the position in units and lots to accurately manage your risks, albeit it works with all major currency pairs and crosses & even though it requires the minimum input values, but allows you to tune it finely to your specific needs. I have predominantly to realign at the 1:10 ratio, due to the fact that I overcharge the trades in scalping times, where I generate some parts of my daily win from short-term trades as well as you know during longer-term trades are running on. I don't make comments which of these open trades (usually 10% by comparing with all closes trades at the History file) are short dated, medium term or long range or currency-cross-pairs, hedging pairs or so. A global formula is that I use smaller lot sizes at long-term pairs and high lotsizes at short-termed currency pairs. It depends a lot of times which probability factor I could match a trade. E.g. if Daily, H4, H1 are signaled a trend I tend to go in with a higher lotsize. A Bullish (Bearish) Counterattack Pattern hasn't for me the same power of argument by contrast with a Bullish Piercing Pattern (Dark Cloud Cover) or a Bullish (Bearish) Engulfing Pattern & higher time frames have for me general more power then PA's at smaller timeframes. I like more to think in dynamical procedures everything flows, so item the currency market. Determining the position size is more affected with the likelihood or a probability factor. When I think the market didn't show a clear trend, it's ranging I like to hedge some trades or select some overspeed crossing pairs in the range of smaller lot sizes.  
  
Deficit Management  
by trading without any stop loss  
I have to hedge (or double, triple, quadruple) the deficit or make with other currency pairs a counterbalance in money management. It's more a daily routine to compensate or equate the losses if there are no need of any stop-loss in the forex landscape. What you need is to develop your trading skills that you are able to do this if trades are running aginst you, but it's not a critical factor concerning the determinant of the daily wins. If the wins have a daily medium weight about 5'000.- you need only 20 trading days to counterbalance a 100'000.-$ deficit. The fewest currency traders think about it! Why? ...because they make more losses then wins, ...contrary it's really easy for an advanced level trader!  
  
May be you could follow the same procedure with a new opened Demo 25'000.-$ Account here at board the next four weeks in place of the 250'000.-$ Account described as example above.  
  
Kindest regards  
FXcube

Thanks for your explanation Forexcube.  
  
As I understand it, your hedging term refers to capital protection by maintaining a higher than 10:1 profit to loss ratio and not to hedge single trades on a loss. Or do you also incorporate the later on your trading?  
This concept seems interesting but the floating losses could get bigger than expected if your open orders are to be all in one side of the table.   
Example: 3 open shorts and 1 long, and then the market rallies up.  
The only way i see you controlling this kind of risk is by offsetting all the open shorts with matching longs, or one could say, hedging the open trades individually.  
  
Please take some more time to educate me. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
Thanks again.

Well it seems i have been misunderstood.  
I never wanted to criticize your trading style but to comprehend it. The fact that you reacted so severely to some of my affirmations, being accurate or not, proves me that your presence in this forum is to boast your own confidence by showing off with some demo results.  
I really wanted to learn more about your trading, but if that's the attitude one gets, i think i'll prefer to stay quiet from now on, and just let you do your thing.  
  
Thanks anyway.

I was shut until i asked for some help, yet the answer was not friendly.  
My reaction was quick and uncalled for, but as you can see the flow of the conversation has been changed by post editing.  
I know that my comeback response was incorrect of me.   
And for that i apologize.

I would not either post statements of my live trading account, thats just asking for trouble. And i probably would not even post demo statements if i was trading a very specific way and/or very specific settings.   
  
I have a friend hwo is not doing so good on his demos, he get to keep them forever, Alpari never close them. Mine usually are around for about a month and then i cant get access to them for some reason.

A short question that only experience can answer:  
  
  
To which Time Zone do your set your pivots? In PivotsD indicator one can choose different time zones for daily pivots. Which ones work best? I guess either GMT or EST. Which one would you recommed?  
  
And what time zone is the results of screens? For example the last screen for february 13?  
  
Danke Dir! 

I found a penny today. That's +100 pips for me.

wow just seen this thead for the first time and it looks GOLD.  
I gotta lot of reading to do to catch up.  
  
But quick question, the first pages of this thread shows MML they play an important role, and by the end of the thread I no longer see MML in any of the charts.  
  
Has MML been thrown out ?

well I have been doing lots of tests on a similar system using MML and I have found similar results in terms of win ratio. I am getting around 70% on the majors. Certain pairs do better than others. And I do have stops ( basically next murrey line or when pattern invalidates ) ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
The reason why I asked my question in the first place is that I found success with one particular MML and not the one being used here. I have found significant differences in performance based on which MML indicator is being used. The difference between 70% and 50% using MML on 4hr time frame is only a few trades.  
  
So I was wandering if the author of this thread has given up on MML ?

maybe you get a max of 20 trades per year for each pair
