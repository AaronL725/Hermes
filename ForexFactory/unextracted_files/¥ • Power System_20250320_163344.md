**Yen . Power System**  
  
Nothing about trading yen here. We will be measuring major currencies strength in terms of JPY units.

  1. Multiple methods of measuring (PC, RSI, HA, ATR ... etc).
  2. Multiple methods of trading
  3. Basket Management
  4. Multiple time frame effect (chain reaction)
  5. Manual and Auto Trading Modes

  
_**Draft Version (00)**_  
  
This is still a draft version to test out. The final system could be completely different. Your input and views will enrich the system as we go a long.  
  
_**Instructions for Manual Trading (Draft Version):**_  
**1\. Input Screen Settings:**

Max Orders is not implemented yet  
  
**2\. Using the mini Dashboard:**

  1. **Actionable buttons are only the time frame buttons (M1, M5 ... ALL), and the Close Button. Other buttons are not.**
  2. **To make a trade on a specific time frame or (ALL tfs), press the time frame button or (ALL button)**
  3. **The system will buy the strongest currency against the weakest currency under the pressed button**
  4. **The Close at Profit/Loss can be pressed to close all current orders.**

  
  
_**VERSION CONTROL:**_

I apologize for the delay ... got many distractions today  
  
However, I managed to build the base for the EA ...  
  
and Here is a snapshot of what's done so far:

The System can be traded :  
  
_**1 - Manually :**_

  1. via pushing Any Time Frame button, and the EA will buy the strongest currency against the weakest currency for that time frame.
  2. Lot Size, Stop Loss, Trailing Stop, and Target per time frame can be set via different methods
  3. Control on Maximum orders per pair, per tf can also be set

_**2 - Automatically :**_

  1. On selected time frames
  2. Same parameters as in Manual Mode can also be set

  
I don't think I will get the chance to finish today, but hopefully can be up and running before Monday. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f918.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

There is no certain method for telling the future. Its a probability issue. You just need more odds on your side. Jpy pairs (in principle) are correlated. If eurjpy goes up while usdjpy is going down, it means eur is stronger than usd at that moment. Will the situation continue ? I can't tell. But lets make use of it untill it changes. .... My simple mind.

hi sir abokwait, Is it okay to provide us or me (a newbie) another example just like the one below? Thank you!

  1. **EUR > USD**: if EURJPY goes up and USDJPY goes down

Since Frank Sinatra sings in his own way, my chart sing... I did it, my way

Of course it is not 'literally' as simple as that, and this is why its taking time to finish the first version of the system.  
  
For example, Percent Change measures the percentage change of each currency against JPY for each time frame, as follows:  
  
(Close of Current Bar - Close of Previous Bar) divided by Close of Previous bar.  
Then currencies are sorted based on their Percent Change in descending order,  
Strongest at the Top and Weakest at the Bottom.  
  
Later on on I might consider also dividing by average bar range (ATR) for each time frame and currency in order to reach more comparable values.  
  
Currencies (majors) and Time Frames (M1 ... D1) are select-able by the trader.  
  
Percentage change is one of the factors considered.  
Other factors might include some indicators like RSI, HA, MA, OB/OS .... etc.  
  
Stay Tuned ...

This is a sample back test on EUR/USD only (as I can't back test multiple pairs simultaneously). Period 2015.  
The EA was made to Buy/Sell EURUSD only when percent change sentiment on all selected frames indicated so.

Note : Complete development will take some time due to dashboard and other issues.  
I am out for some business and will hopefully post a testable version tomorrow.

When testing this make sure that you have all pairs available in market watch as per your selection.  
For example if you have AUDJPY and CHFJPY among JPY selected pairs, make sure you have AUDJPY, CHFJPY and AUDCHF in market watch.  
  
Also when you enter JPY pair names in input, include any suffix as it appear in pair names.  
For example on one of my accounts I have a "r" suffix so the standard EURJPY pair name appears as EURJPYr, so it should be entered as **EURJPYr** in the JPY pair list input.

Hi Khalil,  
Thanks for sharing your idea/EA with us ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
I am testing the EA. I realized that the profit it shows is without calculating the trade commission.

Correct Math. I will add commission and swap once I get back to the office. As I said this only a draft version.

This is an update that subtracts commission and adds swap to the current profit.

Brilliant Abokwaik. One key component of this is, Jpy is always 2nd currency in pairs, making it the easiest (Not that there is anything at all easy about what you have accomplished) to use for comparisons.

TP and SL are in Pips or Points depending on wither your broker supports 4 or 5 digits, mine was 5 digits , and so SL and TP were in Points not Pips (i.e. 300 Points = 30 pips).  
  
If you want SL to be 30 pips, and your broker supports 4 digits for EURUSD (and 2 digits for USDJPY), then set SL as 30.  
While if your broker supports 5 digits for EURUSD (and 3 digits for USDJPY), then set SL as 300.

You don't need to push the pair names buttons.  
Action Buttons are only : Time Frames, and Close at Profit/Loss.

One key component of this is, Jpy is always 2nd currency in pairs, making it the easiest (Not that there is anything at all easy about what you have accomplished) to use for comparisons. Congratulations... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f918.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

You got it ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
Plus, **JPY** is almost inactive - **neutral** (no related news) in London and NY sessions. So when a JPY pair moves, actually its because of the other currency not JPY.

There is an input parameter to show or hide the dashboard. Set it to true in order to show the dashboard.

Do you mean some orders were closed and some were not closed when you pressed the button ?

I hope you didn't change the Magic Number after opening the orders !

I tried it many times and its working just fine. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)  
  
1\. Try to set the Sleep Time to 1 instead of 0, although I tried it with zero and it was OK.  
If it doesn't work,   
2\. Remove the EA (either by closing the chart that has the EA, or by Right_Click --> Expert Advisors --> Remove),  
and apply it again, and try.  
  
Any one else having a similar issue ?

Hi  
  
looks like the amount showing in the dashboard (close at profit / close at loss) is a total different amount what the P/L is showing.​

Can you post a screen shot ?  
  
Maybe commission is not included, and you are using the first release. If so, an updated release with commission and swap included in current P/L can be found on [post # 42.](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=8570404#post8570404)

Then most probably you have some orders opened either manually or using another EA.  
  
Or maybe you have set the Sleep Time to a large value.

Make sure you are using the same settings on both brokers.  
There of course will be differences on H4 and on D1 due to to different broker time, and on M1 due to feed latency, or market makers pricing.  
But M15, M30 and H1 should show similar patterns.

im guesing we can use this dashboard to tell us which pairs to trade, then we use the information to scalp that pair using Udines method?

What exactly do you mean by not implemented ? If you mean AutoTrade is not implemented, I said "it will", which is not equal to "it does".

Doesn't work with [FXCM](/brokers/fxcm "View FXCM Broker Profile") but it worked with [Tickmill](/brokers/tickmill "View Tickmill Broker Profile")![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1). Both Broker doesn't have any pre/suffix. I used close_at_profit EA on FXCM for ATR Breakout EA. Looking at end of day today. Looks like it didn't work either

Mr. Abokwaik, I would like to suggest an alarm (pop up window or sound or both) to when a line would have an agreement of 3, 4, or 5 TFs. What do you think? I guess it would be a good help to look at the EA and try to find a good entry with a fine momentum.  
  
Thank you.

Abokwaik  
  
Thanks you for starting this thread. If you would like help coding or simply need an extra pair of eyes to go over the EA please let me know.   
  
I was also wondering if this could be used on other currencies like the AUD or EUR. Same principle different currency?

Hi,  
I installed EA showing dash board but its not working.  
I pressed one after one all buttons but no chance! Is there any activation required? if yes how? Please advise.

No activation is required.  
Its already working fine with many people.  
  
It seems that its not working with specific brokers or MT4 builds. !!!  
  
Kindly advise on who is your broker and which build, and I will try to install it and diagnose the issue.

Thanks for the suggestion.  
  
This was just a DRAFT version of the system, still too much to come.  
I just liked to share it with you guys while still in development, and I am sure that your input will inspire me.

There will be many more input parameters needed for the EA.  
The EA has so many input parameters for colors which would become useless after making your choices of pair colors.  
  
**So my suggestion and request for people with "Artistic Eye" to post their best settings for colors,**  
**so that I fix them in the code, and remove them from input screen.**

For Math People :  
  
Currently the "ALL" column is calculated simply by adding together the actual values representing currency power on each time frame.  
This is of course a naive method.  
And I am sure there are better methods to reach a collective currency power based on all time frames.  
  
One idea I can think of is to collect the currency rank (instead of actual percentage) and add them up on all time frames to get the collective currency power.

Every Trader should like the take profit Green Colour. For the alert bell, i will like it to ring as long as possible when all time frame is good to go or when we have 5/6 or 4/6. Thanks 

i have tried to start trades with a trend, now i prefer to follow the trend

> 
> Ignored

The back test was run to trade one pair only, and was using the "ALL" column only.  
  
Trading methods are still under study.  
  
It would be very nice if we can catch the move from the early beginning. This way will lead to many small losses due to false signals on lower time frames, but when it works out it can compensate all that plus a handsome profit.  
  
Using this way, we can start with a small position size on M5, if the move dies, we stop, if it continues to M15, we add a bigger size, if it dies, we stop, if it continues to M30, we add a bigger size ... and so on.

Besides the mathematical calculations, there is the Visual Effect, by looking enough at the "currency grid" :nerd:,  
you might start to recognize some patterns that can lead to profitable methods.

I think best way to weigh them would be based on respective time frames using following formula: 1/Sqrt( DayMinutes / timeframe)  
This could also be used on ranks (which might be better)  
  
example:  
  
1 minute weight= 1/Sqrt(1440/1)  
5 minute = 1/Sqrt(1440/5)  
15 minute = 1/Sqrt(1440/15) etc....  
  
1 Day = 1/Sqrt(1440/1440) (which is 1)  
  
Than the final becomes :  
Sum = (Minute 1 percent change x Minute 1 weight) + (Minute 5 percent change x Minute 5 weight) + (Minute 15 percent change x Minute 15 weight)  
Final weighted average = Sum / SumOfWeights

Please do. It is the statistical variance method for time based volatility. Other methods would be just guessing but this would give the correct weights. As for the scalpers, they could use individual columns instead of the "ALL" column.  
  
Even for the scalpers "ALL" column would give the trend of the day, to select their trading direction for the day.

I did. Actually the effect of time frames is already factored in because of the pip range of the time frame gets smaller as the time frame gets smaller.  
With your method were are even minimizing more the effect of smaller time frames, which could lead to more "Lagging" which I hate most of indicators for.  
  
I will apply it to the Ranks, I think it will be better.

The method that I have mentioned will only work for changes in percentages not changes in pips.

Yes. It is change in percentage, but compared to pair price not the bar range.  
For example, if we take USDJPY, with the following data of D1 and M15.  
  
_________D1 ___________M15  
_________=========== =========  
bar1close 120.74 ________120.61  
bar2close 120.56 ________120.59  
pip change +18 __________+3  
Percentage 18/120.56 _____3/120.59  
Normaized **15% ________2%**

This is the result with Weight offered by GoldTheHun applied to the Rank.  
  
Makes more sense to me.  
If all are Ok I am going to implement this for the next version.  
  
Any suggestions for the colors ? If you are fine with the defaults, I will fix them and remove them from the input screen, as it is too much crowded.

Thanks, I like to keep it under control for now.  
  
As for applying the same concept by choosing another currency as a reference, yes it is possible,   
  
I chose JPY because of what "diamonddbw" already noticed "One key component of this is, Jpy is always 2nd currency in pairs, making it the easiest to use for comparisons. "   
Plus, **JPY** is almost inactive - **neutral** (no related news) in London and NY sessions. So when a JPY pair moves, actually its because of the other currency not JPY.

Thanks for openess, Mr.Abokwaik. I think that looking at all inputs and keeping the EA on the right track, simple and with no futil or unecessary adds will make it a winner.  
  
I guess that one of the best things is to use one single range of colour to show strengh. So if we ar looking at JPY for example, it should have the same colour of all the other currencies. The one thing that must change is its tone, darker or lighter, i.e. darker more strengh, lighter less strengh. I believe that it will be the easiest way for our eyes to spot the best investments. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
Other thing I can think of is, either you do a scalper-oriented EA or swinger-oriented EA. If you mix it you might loose some efectiveness. You can always do two versions of the EA. One at the time I guess...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

A very interesting concept well presented. I have found in my early experimentation with the dashboard that it often obscures the current price action. Is it possible to have an option to relocate it say to top left rather than top right of the screen? Obviously there are work arounds but it might be a nice future enhancement. If I am missing something please advise.

Hi Abokwaik  
Just did a quick "scalp" with last uploaded EA on AUDUSD D1.  
Noticed the D1 button seems to to stay "stuck" and the  
"close at profit" and profit differs ?  
I opened AUDUSD D1 chart to see what happens and just changed to M1  
to see what happens there when I close trade and took snapshot.  
Colors seems ok to my old eyes.  
Perhaps you could consider opening chart of specific currency  
after trade opened by specifying template in settings?  
Anyhow - good work so far!  
Cheers

You can use Chart Shift to allow for more space for the dashboard. See image.

If you used the default settings for "Loop Back Bars" which is 3, the system will measure the percentage change for the 3 previous days.

This is the code used for closing positions:  
  

Inserted Code
    
    
    void close_current_orders()
    { int k=-1;
       bool x= false;
       for( j=0;j<100;j++) ord_arr[j]=0;
       
       int ot = OrdersTotal();
       for(j=0;j<ot;j++)
       {
          if(OrderSelect(j,SELECT_BY_POS,MODE_TRADES)==false) break;
          if( OrderMagicNumber()==Magic_Number && (OrderType()==OP_SELL || OrderType()==OP_BUY) )
          {  k = k + 1; 
             ord_arr[k]=OrderTicket();
          }
        }
        for(j=0;j<=k;j++)
        {  bool OrderClosed=false;
           tries=0;
           while(!OrderClosed && tries<oper_max_tries)
                {
                   x=OrderSelect(ord_arr[j],SELECT_BY_TICKET,MODE_TRADES);
                   if(OrderType()==OP_SELL && x) OrderClosed=OrderClose(ord_arr[j],OrderLots(),Ask,100,NULL);
                   if(OrderType()==OP_BUY && x) OrderClosed=OrderClose(ord_arr[j],OrderLots(),Bid,100,NULL);
                   tries=tries+1;
                }
        }
    }

  
Could it be because of using NULL instead of clrNone, I doubt.  
Anyway I gonna install FXCM and see.

Just plugged in your function in another EA to try with NULL with no luck. I am using MPTM and its closing all orders on fxcm. So i am comparing MPTM that function and yours to see what fxcm have different than other broker. MPTM link is here and yes its mq4 file <http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=89371> in case you can find something

Even i don't care much about pair colors if you really want to change it then i would go for this colors. Its from MADdash Thread. I find it more visual on Eye for some reason.

> Just plugged in your function in another EA to try with NULL with no luck. I am using MPTM and its closing all orders on fxcm. So i am comparing MPTM that function and yours to see what fxcm have different than other broker. MPTM link is here and yes its mq4 file <http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=89371> in case you can find something

Thanks AK.  
  
I figured out what was the issue, and it should even behaved the same way on other brokers, but I don't know how they accepted it.  
  
It was a stupid mistake from my side, and I am glad that it was not behaving correctly on some brokers, in order to be fixed.  
  
When working with multiple pairs in one EA, you should always refer to price (Open, Close, Ask, Bid ... etc) using the MarketInfo funtion in order to be able to pass the required symbol, because moist probably it will not be the same symbol you attached the EA to.  
  
This was implemented through the whole EA, EXCEPT, for the Close Function, which was added later on, and copied from another EA. " a Copy and Paste" mistake.  
  
BTW: This will also fix the close_at_profit EA , from ATR Break Out thread, which was not working correctly on some brokers.  
  
Thank you all for your input and All the best  
  
Attached is the Fixed EA.  
We are still on version 00 (the Draft Version).

> For Math People : Currently the "ALL" column is calculated simply by adding together the actual values representing currency power on each time frame. This is of course a naive method. And I am sure there are better methods to reach a collective currency power based on all time frames. One idea I can think of is to collect the currency rank (instead of actual percentage) and add them up on all time frames to get the collective currency power. But do we give similar weight to each time frame, or give higher weight to higher time frames ... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)...

maybe 'square' i.e. normalize/standardize or rank price and time first before multi timeframing...  
  
remember position is everything when comparing currencies to each other  
  
they cycle slosh around each other..... meaning one is high for a while then another and then another..... they keep changing positions..... it is vital to realize this when using comparison currency methods IMO  
  
the more one can compare apples to apples the better I would think  
  
2 cents  
  
hope it helps  
  
PS please make the mql available if possible

Well, volatility rule states that the raw percentage differences should be used with Sqrt(Time). So that is what I have suggested

one can get crazy with the math stuff...not my intent... just for logic's sake.... just some thoughts for what they are worth....  
  
  
.... heatmaps show WHERE not how.... they are positional....that is their greatest value..... apples to apples shows whats likely coming next in _position._..  
  
from what i've seen,,,many traditional heatmaps give 4 quadrants....  
  
so four categories price can fall into.....once price and time are standardized and currencies are standardized against each other  
  
  
negative and falling....negative and rising  
  
positive and falling...or finally positive and rising  
  
get it right with standardized data first and foremost and you have an awesome weapon...perhaps a moley quail even

Explained in previous post.  
  
**There is an input parameter to show or hide the dashboard. Set it to true in order to show the dashboard.**  
  
_I should have set this to true as default, but I was back testing so I had to disable it, and forgot it as false._

Nice touch IsabellaD ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
Actually (for the Auto Version) I was going to use different Magic Numbers for Orders Opened by signals from different time frames, so that they can be closed when signals change on those time frames.  
  
But for Manual Trading ... Your suggestion is Perfect.

This message is from the EA. And means that pair is not on your market watch.

It was a stupid mistake from my side, and I am glad that it was not behaving correctly on some brokers, in order to be fixed. When working with multiple pairs in one EA, you should always refer to price (Open, Close, Ask, Bid ... etc) using the MarketInfo funtion in order to be able to pass the required symbol, because moist probably it will not be the same symbol you attached the EA to. This was implemented...

your dashboard does not work yet . there are everywhere the same values ​​in the pairs . In EA you need to set the pairs just as with your broker . So EURUSDm ...

Thanks dingdong.  
  
You did an enormous contribution to the dashboard trading. So thank you for that on behalf of all dashboard lovers.   
Car makers measure car power in number of horses. And here we measure currency power in number of yens. Hence the thread name.   
Actually it was not intended to be a dashboard system, as I am in favor of auto trading. Dashboard came out as a by-product.  
  
All the best, Khalil

> For Math People : Currently the "ALL" column is calculated simply by adding together the actual values representing currency power on each time frame. This is of course a naive method. And I am sure there are better methods to reach a collective currency power based on all time frames. One idea I can think of is to collect the currency rank (instead of actual percentage) and add them up on all time frames to get the collective currency power. But do we give similar weight to each time frame, or give higher weight to higher time frames ... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)...

Hi abokwaik,  
  
Thank you for your efforts into this great EA. For the "ALL" column, how is the idea of dividing D1 change by 1440, H4 by 240, H1 by 60 and so on down to the M1, so that the changes will all be calculated on "per minute" basis. Just an idea...  
  
thanks again

Hi abokwaik... First off-- thanks for posting your new toy ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)... I like the concept of using the yen as a neutral currency to compare the others against..   
  
My question is on how to trade the ea in auto mode... When i look at[ this post](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=8572910#post8572910) i see there were different trades placed at different times... Yet the only way i seem to be able to get a trade to happen on my screen is-- i press one of the buttons-- it places a trade and then lets that trade go to a win or loss and then its done..If i click on two of the time buttons-- it will place 2 trades to win or loss... How can i get the ea to search for new trades and automatically take them like how they appear to be taken in [this link](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=8572910#post8572910) ?

Yet the only way i seem to be able to get a trade to happen on my screen is-- i press one of the buttons-- it places a trade and then lets that trade go to a win or loss and then...

hi mtbb,  
  
Auto Mode is not developed yet.  
  
When done, and run in auto mode, Dashboard will not appear at all.  
Trades will be taken automatically on one or multiple time frames based on system settings. 

No guts, no glory

Hi,  
I installed EA, see the clear Dash Board but EA is not taking any trades and there is no error in the expert log nor in journal log. Please advise how to make EA active.

that's the best thing I've seen lately , again many thanks . I use it as follows ( even manually ) Table of Yen_pairs - > which is excellent ( in this case USDJPY ) trade via other EA shortcut and by the way I collect the Pairs from your dashboard timeframe accordingly. Top marks from me : clear, concise , fast, secure  
thanks Khalil

> For Math People : Currently the "ALL" column is calculated simply by adding together the actual values representing currency power on each time frame. This is of course a naive method. And I am sure there are better methods to reach a collective currency power based on all time frames. One idea I can think of is to collect the currency rank (instead of actual percentage) and add them up on all time frames to get the collective currency power. But do we give similar weight to each time frame, or**give higher weight to higher time frames** ......

That is the answer !  
  
Additionally you can rank the methods used by weight.

If you can catch the result and understand its dependance on either TF or the method used, you can try to teach your system by means of Genetic Algorithms. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

I used a simpler version of what GoldTheHun had suggested for weighting time frames.  
The method used will give a weight of 7 to D1, 6 to H4, 5 to H1 ... 1 to M1.

Hi,  
  
Is it a good idea to add arrows which tell us if the percentage is growing yes or no with respect to the previous bar ??  
  
See example.

Hi,  
  
Did myself, i have not the intention to copy you, just some visual support.  
Ok i did the simple calculation like you wrote down in the beginning. Needed to make the arrows visible  
and to check if it works.  
Also was thinking about should lowest TF not be on the left, but that is more taste then really helpfull.  
I think that news info would be good to have. Will make sample later, for news i have an include file  
which is in my opinion very convenient in use.

Great job done.   
Can you please advise me why it shows invalid pair when I click on any time frame despite I entered exact symbol of currencies in the EA. My MT4 is from Robo forex. Also appreciate if you can advise how to trade manually using this dashboard.

hi radadiya,  
  
In reference to what Abokwaik said below...  
I think you don't have the currency pairs available on your Market Watch with your broker or verify if there's a prefix/suffix appear in your currency pair names.

> When testing this make sure that you have all pairs available in market watch as per your selection. For example if you have AUDJPY and CHFJPY among JPY selected pairs, make sure you have AUDJPY, CHFJPY and AUDCHF in market watch. Also when you enter JPY pair names in input, include any suffix as it appear in pair names. For example on one of my accounts I have a "r" suffix so the standard EURJPY pair name appears as EURJPYr, so it should be entered as EURJPYr in the JPY pair list input.

Hi v2vboni,  
I have all 7 JPY pairs currencies in market watch and the suffix (i.e. USDJPY.e,EURJPY.e,GBPJPY.e,AUDJPY.e,NZDJPY.e,CADJPY.e,CHFJPY.e) is also placed in the setting, despite that it shows either invalid currencies or Trades are not allowed whereas EA settings is made to allow live trades and auto trading also enabled. Its not taking manual trades by pressing any of the button in the panel. You can see from the attached screen shot.  
Every time I pressed button it shows following comments in the journal and no error in the expert log.  
  
2015.11.04 23:42:28.984 '896168': order sell 0.01 AUDCHF opening at 0.7094 sl: 1.0102 tp: 0.2094 failed [Trade is disabled]  
2015.11.04 23:42:28.781 '896168': order sell 0.01 AUDCHF opening at 0.7094 sl: 1.0102 tp: 0.2094 failed [Trade is disabled]  
  
2015.11.04 23:42:28.531 '896168': order sell 0.01 AUDCHF opening at 0.7094 sl: 1.0102 tp: 0.2094 failed [Trade is disabled]  
  
It seems to me there is some problem in coding of symbols having suffix. In my MT$ the trading is allowed for currencies shaving suffix .e and not allowed for currencies without suffix, wherein the panel has the symbols without suffix (i.e. as it seems .e setting is not linked to button) so it shows trades not allowed.  
  
Now I installed on pairs without any prefix and sufix of MT4 of [IC Markets](/brokers/ic-markets "View IC Markets Broker Profile") and kept all pairs in Market watch and it shows "In Valid Pair"  
  
I appreciate if any one advise me whats wrong here!

I believe the most important part of v2v's post was:  
  
For example if you have AUDJPY and CHFJPY among JPY selected pairs, make sure you have AUDJPY, CHFJPY and AUDCHF in market watch.

Hi,  
Yes, I placed AUDCHF also and its same situation prompting as "Invalid Pair"  
  
Now I placed all 28 pairs in market watch then it started placing orders. So in the instruction manual it may be mentioned that we need to have all major crosses ( all 28 pairs in the market watch). It opens trades other than JPY pairs.

Thank you for your big job ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f917.png?v=15.1) .  
Adding the filter on Spread maybe could be good for lower TF , or for lower SL  
( for my poor english ) i do an example :  
Limit spread 3pips  
The EA enter only if the spread for this cross in less than 3 pips.  
Regard , and thank you another time.

Thanks abokwaik for this great tool.  
  
I was wondering why it's not taking any trades when I click the TF. I have no error in the expert log or in the journal. I have added the suffix and have all 27 pairs (I'm using [Exness](/brokers/exness "View Exness Broker Profile") and they are missing the NZDCHF pair) in the market watch. Pls help.  
  
Thanks.

very good thread   
and very good effort   
thank you very much mr khalil  
  
i have 2 points about trading the concept of the strongest against the weakest   
  
1- if we gonna sell the the weakest and buy the strongest : let's say we work on h1 time frame and i put the expert and it give me that the euro is the strongest and the usd is the weakest so i will buy eur/usd but when i look to the chart i found that the pair was going up for 5 big green candles and then it will go down now for retracement the idea that i want to say that to get more profit i must enter at the first candle that give that the euro is strongest and usd is weakest so can you add an option to the expert that shows us for how long this pair ( x ) is the strongest and this is the pair ( y ) is the weakest for every time frame   
  
  
2- as we all know for the usd to become weakest and euro to be strongest this will be reflected on the chart as a big move upward   
and as we all know that all pairs move in a shape of big move then retracement   
so why we not use it in opposite way ??  
you can make an indicator similar in shape to the indicator ( ccfp ) but with your method of calculation and we can set some levels for extreme weakness and strength   
and when this level touched we enter against it ( we sell the extreme strong and buy the extreme weak )  
  
and thank you again for your big efforts mr khalil

> Ignored

  
according to my first point look to the picture   
  
look at the column of d1 : the 3 in that above mean that the aud is the strongest for the last three candles ( 3 days ) the idea is if i put the expert now and let's say i prefer to work on the d1 time frame   
if i see this i will not take any trades because i came late and the aud is strong for 3 days now and i prefer to catch it in the first day   
  
and the 2 below mean the nzd is weak for the last 2 days >>>>>> etc  
  
the conclusion is to buy the strongest and sell the weakest at the beginning of the movement not after they move a lot   
  
did you get my idea ??  
  
i hope this idea make the method stronger

Please not that the "tool" is **configurable as per your requirements,**  
So for example if you're interested in  
specific currencies, lets say USD, GBP and EUR only,  
and specific time frames D1, H4 and H1 only.  
  
The tool will look like this :

No need for all pairs to be available in Market Watch.  
You need only the crosses based on your JPY pair selection.  
So as per the example above, where JPY pairs are only USDJPY, EURJPY and GBPJPY  
you ONLY need the following pairs in the market watch: EURUSD, GBPUSD and EURGBP

Max Spread as Input is not applicable as we are dealing with multiple pairs that will have different [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide").  
The approach for this will be a bit complicated, where we use "Max Spread Deviation Percentage" as an Input parameter, we calculate average spread over a period for each pair and accept the transaction only if transaction spread is within acceptable spread deviation.  
  
This, in addition to max slippage and ECN support will be developed later on.  
  
My focus now is to evaluate the system concept and see if it really has and edge or not, specially after finishing the Auto Version of this EA.

Thanks for your input zelenko,  
  
The sensitivity of price action can be controlled by the "Loop Back Bars" and "Starting Bar" inputs.   
  
What is the "ccfp" indicator that you referred to in your post?

if you program an indicator like ccfp in shape but with your calculation   
  
we can visually back test the method and we can use the extremes way that i described earlier   
  
and here the article for the ccfp

This is a very good suggestion I also had in mind. To begin with, the "waves" can be made to plot the changes in the last "ALL" column of the indicator. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)

this picture illustrate very well the importance to see the GAP. in the corners marked those currencies are still strongest or weakest but LOOSING POWER (pullback!). In such a case it is not good entry.

if the line comes from down and is rising it doesn't (jet) mean it becomes strong. this happen when a currency was very weak/strong and go into consolidation, so don't take this (counter) signals as for sure to be a reversal! At least until it cross the middle line.

OK lets get this straight, once and for all...  
There is no AUTO trade yet, correct?  
Secondly the EA should or should not automatically trade for you if you click on a time frame button??? Because I have seen on this thread that this was an option.  
  
Can someone verify please.  
Is the EA able to trade for us when we click on a time frame button or do we have to trade fully manual?  
  
Thanks, Chris.

Yes Chris. It should open a trade when you press a time frame button. If it is not, then there is something wrong with your settings. This what I mean with manual trading. ... On the other hand, in Auto trading when developed, the dashboard will not be needed, and the robot should take care of everything based on trader settings.

I would think it would be better, if instead of placing the trade, it popped up a window identifing the strongest and weakest and asking if you want to trade it.

From my side, as I'm new in Forex trading... this kind of indicators helps a lot to have an informed decision or increase my logical probability if I should go for long or short. It doesn't mean I go for long if the dashboard indicates I should. There are times that you need to look to another instrument that affect such rise of one currency pair after another or in parallel. In automated trading just like this dashboard, it is still depends on how you configure it to do automated trading for you. But we all know that there's no 100% indicators or EA that can predict the future. If these would be able to produce a 75% reward, I would probably go for it.  
  
![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) In short... Now I pray less during my trading time and I just simply act on what I learned here at FF. Then by the end of the day, I just pray to be thankful in everything.  
  
  
Have a great trading week!

Hi abokwaik, there's no error in the experts log or journal. I'm just wondering whether it's the broker. I am using [Exness](/brokers/exness "View Exness Broker Profile") and they are missing the NZDCHF pair. Could this be the reason? Is anyone else using the dash with Exness?

Missing a pair is not an issue, the only thing is that you can not trade it.  
  
Can you see the Dashboard ? i  
Is the dashboard ALIVE (dancing) ?  
  
Is it an ECN account ?

Suffix is already handled. But it seems that you also have NZDUSD in market watch where trading is disabled. The EA looks for the first pair that starts with NZDUSD and takes the full pair name from market watch.

Hide NZDUSD from the market watch. From file menu choose Symbols and hide pairs that you don't need.

Yes I can see the DB and it is alive; changing positions as it should. Everything seems to be working as it should but it does not take any trades when I click on the TFs. BTW, it's not an ecn account.

Good Morning,  
  
This is a beta version of Y_Power_01 Auto Trading (no dashboard).  
Based on which time frame you attach to, it will open a new order according to Strongest/Weakest currency on each new candle.  
So if you attach to M15, it will open a new order every 15 minutes, Limited by Max Orders input.  
  
Exit at Profit Target (Money), or Loss Limit (Money) inputs.  
  
Note : I just put it into test, so bugs are expected to show up. Test only on demo accounts.  
Note2: Back Testing is not possible as it uses multiple pairs.

This is a completely auto version, it will not show the dashboard, it will work in the background, based on your settings.

Stop Loss and Take Profit is not in pips, its in money on all open positions, once either reached, EA will close all orders.

Hi  
It is very difficult to determine the total profit. Depends on the order quantity. But the determination of earnings per order is better. This is my opinion

It will trade all pairs except JPY pairs ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1), as JPY is used as a reference (unit of measurement).

Would be awesome if you posted the results regularly. As you said backtesting is not possible, this way it would give everybody an insight.

I would, but the problem is that I am moving a lot these days.  
  
This is the current status : I attached it to M30, SL=$200, TP=$200.  
  
None hit so far.

My notes so far:

  1. I think its better to control max orders per pair instead of per cycle. Maybe profit/loss also by trade/pair as [ahhamidz](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=8585507#post8585507) requested
  2. Reduce target/loss to 1% instead of 2% per cycle.
  3. I am using 3 bars loop back, starting from previous bar. May be this a bet late, specially when enabling D1 and H4.

Thanks, Its clear now.   
  
You need to include the **.** (dot) as a suffix at the end of each jpy pair. So your JPY pairs become USDJPY., EURJPY., GBPJPY. and so on.

Thanks a lot for new version![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
\- I would like too take each pair once per cycle (ahhamidz).  
\- It would be fine to determine in addition when to go into the market and when out. For instance 08:20)  
To simulate this manuel does not succeed because profit-/loss-count is interrupted in case of switch off automated trading.

All fine, but I didn't get your final note.  
  
However, there will be no switching of modes. Manual and Auto will always be different EAs.  
And my focus now is on the Auto trader.  
Manual was just to give you a taste of what's going on inside the EA.

Excuse me, what is meant by note?  
  
Both EA mix is not my objective.  
I had the intention not to add further positions after a time x cycle is running, but continue current cycle till tp/SL.  
  
Thanks for the extensive and very useful work.

Looks fine Emira7e,   
  
For a 100K balance you can set the lot size to 1 instead of 0.1 and profit target to 2000 instead of 200.

Trade Cycle Update  
  
Yesterday cycle was closed @ target profit Yesterday only 20 minutes after I left.  
I increased the profit target from 200 to 210 before I left to cover commissions.   
The closure was @ $216, however commissions were 25, so net profit was 190.

So far, the auto version is using :

  1. Only the "ALL" column, which contains the RANK summation of all selected time frames
  2. Only one strength method, namely "Percent Change"

Implementations other variations will hopefully come later on depending on my time.  
  
Give it a try, and enlighten me with your experience.  
  
All the best. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

The Time Frame where you attach the EA controls the opening of new trades. Example : If you attach it to M15, it will open a new trade every 15 minutes, (total of 4 trades per hour), and so on.  
  
Time Frame inputs in the settings screen (true/false) will control how power is calculated. So for a scalper for example, he can enable M5,M15 and M30.  
For a swing trader, he can enable M30,H4, D1.  
  
Sensitivity to recent price action can be controlled by Start Bar, and Loop Back Bars.

I would suggest testing the dashboard before running the auto version.  
It will give you a closer look and feel on how this thing is working.

Trading 0.1 lots, on M5 is unlikely to make you profits.   
Too many trades in a short time will experience high expenses (spread, commission) , and more false signals.  
The minimum I can think of is to attach the EA to M15, although still risky.  
  
Remember this is a multi-pair EA, depending on the balance you have and the expected number of trades (or max orders), setup your lot size, in order to limit the risk.  
  
It will help me better evaluate the EA if you post your losing results.   
  
Thanks for testing.

I noticed that most members are using all pairs.  
You know (as I explained in an earlier post) you can remove any unwanted currencies by removing the JPY pair for that currency from the JPY pairs list.  
  
For example you can remove all CHF pairs by deleting the CHFJPY from JPY pairs input.

The system is under evaluation. I wouldn't recommend trying it on a real account before completing at least a one-month on demo with consistent profits.

Hi,  
  
Can I put the EA on a 15M chart so it will open more trades quickly but restrict it to 1H and up? Will that work?  
Default settings, only changed the lot size to 0.01, tp to 10$ and SL to 20$, 3 baskets closed in loss so far.  
  
  
Thanks for this ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) I really love your ideas and EAs.

hi abokwaik  
  
It would be great if possible to add automatic reverse trading mode.

I also think for scalping 5 min chart, that EA need reverse mode, cuz every time hit retreat.

Maybe not always, but definitely in some hours is needed reverse mode.

I am sorry suneth, I had a bad experience sharing MQL files on this forum.  
Over 90% of my systems/robots/indicators are already open source.

Yes of course, Remasesa.  
  
You can attach the EA to M15.  
AND disable (set to false) M1, M5, M15 and M30, while enable (set to true) H1, H4 and D1.  
or whatever combination you like.  
  
There is no relation between the enabling/disabling time frames in the settings screen AND the chart you attach the EA to.  
Each is serving a different purpose.

I think the problem with most retail traders (like us) is that we are always looking for a system that makes a fortune from the first run, a system that never lose.  
So if we start a system and we see few losses, we go directly and change the rules.  
  
I've studied and tested different types of trading systems, and developed many, part of which I shared on this forum,  
and believe me when I say that till now , I couldn't build (or find for that matter) a mechanical system that CONSISTENTLY make a 10% per month.

Thanks Abokwaik for all your great work. It really is appreciated.  
  
But I was wondering if it would be possible to add a close at profit button on the Auto version.

Hi Abokwaik  
I think it would have to apply these three improvements for the Expert work well. The option to closed operations after each session.  
And to select the number of operation per pair. And limit the number of baskets both winners as losers.  
Scalping strategy short term  
So you can go well.

Hi,  
  
EA just ate up all my demo account ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
So, I would like to use 0.01 lot size, what would be the best TP and SL for it? I've set it to 10$ and 20$ but SL always seems to get hit.  
EA was placed on M15, M5 and 1H charts (not on the same time), with default settings at first and only 1H, 4H and 1D options allowed later on.  
All instances on those charts with defaults and changed settings showed the same behaviour of hitting SL without being in profit except one time this morning when the basket was showing 1$ profit for about 10 minutes and then went to -7$ in profit and to SL about two hours later.  
  
Still testing it and would like to know from others on what account size this EA had been activated and such, as I do not have 10K$ accounts, I try to be realistic when I open a demo account and try to match it as best possible to my ability to open a live account, which, as this time is only 1K$, which, as mentioned previously had been eaten up while others had reported good results with this EA.  
  
  
Thanks again for this EA, I've been following you and your work for quite some time, I love your work and your replies to threads you participate in are always good reading material for someone wishing to learn more.

If you are going to practice with this EA. It's no good picking a lot out of thin air.  
  
You need to know what's your brokers minimum lot is. There's not a lot of brokers who would allow a 0.01 lot size,  
As for account size? I started practising with this EA. Last week on my demo accounts which at the time add a balance of 5,186.00.  
In the first 8 days of practising and trying things out my balance went down to 3290.73. It was on Wednesday the 11th that everything clicked into place. I found that on the one minute chart I could do multiple trades on just one currency. Which is  
EU/USD. I am still getting some losing trades something like one losing trade to 10 wins. And tonight as I stop trading my balances 3863.58.  
That's 572.85 profit in the last 3 days.  
You say your stop losses always seems to get hit. I would not use the automated EA if I was you. I would use the one with the basket you can take your profit when you want with the take profit button. And manage your trades better.  
I have asked Abokkwaik if it would be possible to add a close at profit button on the Auto version. He said ok.  
  
  
Good luck.

Hi and thanks for your answer.  
  
All the brokers I've been with allowed 0.01 lot size for micro and mini account sizes, some also offered this lot size even for the VIP/regular/whatever higher stats accounts so 0.01 lot size isn't something weird to ask for ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) at least, in my experience.  
  
As for the choice of EA, I believe you are referring to the dashboard EA, right? I haven't tried it, I thought it wasn't automated and you needed to choose the TF for it to trade, no? Or I might be completely wrong here, I'll scroll back and search for it. If the wisdom is the same for the dashboard and the automated EA, if I click the 1H, 4H and 1D on the dashboard version, then having my SL set to 20$ would mean it would get hit again, no? Maybe I need a bigger SL? It's not less of a TP since I only got 1 TP hit and the rest, as I said nearly all went to SL without being at profit even once.  
  
  
Thanks again for replying, I do try to learn.

Thank you for your concern Isabella.  
I think you misunderstood redfan.  
He is talking about the same system.  
My appreciation to all members testing this system and report their observations.  
Thank you all and please keep it cool.  
Good night.

Yes. But not the "timer" version. It should be "tick" based. And you can back test it after I add the "tick" option.  
However, MT4 will allow you to test only one pair at a time (the single pair that you select to run the Strategy Tester against.).  
  
I might do an MT5 version for multi-pair back testing if I had the time and enthusiasm for it.

Abo i tested it on 5 min chart with max open orders 3 and 30 min chart in certain hours it shows good results so i set ЕА to trade only these hours. But still i think will need one improvment for my strategy if is possible. I trade with 0.01 lot so will be good when hit SL, EA to open next order with + 0.01 and when hit TP to reset to default. 

Don't change something that work!

Hi @all,  
  
first thank you abowaik to write this EA.  
  
But i have som problems with it until now. I am using a Demo Account at LCG with really bad Spread. Demo Demo Account is fast in the execution of trades and will close all Trades fast. Now i have tested this System for a week and make more loss than gain. I tried the first and the third version of the auto trade EA. In both directions, but the EA runs more in the SL than in the Take Profit Zone. First i used the standard Parameters. The result was bad. From a Demo Balance of 5000$ i have only 4300 left.  
I have tried different Timezones but the result is even bad in all. More lost than gain.  
  
So whats wrong here?  
  
This week i will try a different Broker (Hoteforex) with Demo, they have even low Spread at the most of the Pairs. I will try it in different Timezones to test if there are better results if it is because.  
  
So hope that anyone post his parameters to help for a positive result here for all .  
  
Thank you

Its M5. So only M1 is disabled. However this EA is inconsistent for me. Sometimes it does not open a trade after new candle appeared. Don´t know why.

Check Experts Tab for "Off Quotes" errors. The EA tries 5 times to open a trade. I can let it try more, or until the order is opened.  
Notice that Max Spread and Slippage are not included yet.

Sorry for question but when you write "5M" is mean that are you using entry for tf5 in experts proprieties (so m1, m15, m30......are "false") ?

Chk post 356. In reverse mode, EA will buy weakest currency and sell the strongest.

Hello Abokwaik , are fws days that i look this EA/indicator and i have an idea that i will test :  
I think when the price is in ranging (flat) is good to use the reverse mode , viceversa if the price is in trend could be good the normal mode and for see it i could use the GBP/JPY (to see if the is in tren or not).  
I'll test it ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f937-200d-2642-fe0f.png?v=15.1)  
Thank you very mutch , hope is always the last to die ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
EDIT : GBPY or (next time if it could be better) the basket 14core

Exactly. Normal mode is suitable for trending periods, while Reverse mode is suitable for ranging periods. The GOLDEN QUESTION is how to know if it's trending or ranging?

One way to get around this could be to enable reverse mode after a number of losses on normal mode and vice versa.

Another EA idea based on yen power is to trade Correlation Divergence on yen pairs, buy hedging a Buy on weakest yen pair with a Sell on strongest yen pair. More about this later.

yes it is the golden qestion but i think to do simple things : if the price breack the congestion area then i think to use normal mode , and viceversa.  
For to try this i need one graph that is good for all value , maybe it colud be GBP/JPY or the basket of 14 pair (<http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=446654> here is where i found the 14 pair core , very beutiful)

Hello the EA could not be installed on chart. The export log says its newer version not supported. My MT4 is 902 built. Is that newer version of MT4?

Thanks for suggestion. Most of people in FF use Gyazo captured link for better clarity. How you take picture of screen shot in JPG format? I can see word file very clear in my PC. You just enlarge and its very clear.

As we know markets range 70-75% of the time and trend 25-30% of the time.  
So why i bet on 70%.however I do not run reverse mode 24/5 If market strong trend i will turn off reverse mode. that's just my 2 cents.

Hi rad, The EA is working just fine at your end. However, reaching the profit target or even loss limit of $100 using 0.01 lot size on M30 time frame won't happen very soon.Either increase lot size or decrease time frame.All the best.

Hoi!  
  
I have a simple idea to measure the trend and sideways: ADX WildersDMI. Below 20 sideway abow 20 trend.  
I use it with bollinger bands in a simple strathegy,when ADX is below 20 and price is between the bands, mean sideways, simple rules.

Thank you abokwaik!  
Thank you so much for developing the EA. Yes , now basket is closed in loss today. I will test for three weeks same time frame and lot and see how it works then I will reduce time frame and lot size too.  
The Version 4 is **not** getting attached to the chart. Any resolution problem please!

I have just installed [FXCM](/brokers/fxcm "View FXCM Broker Profile") (as you're using it) but the build was 910.  
  
I think you need to update your MT4 by existing and starting again.

If you fear losing them, just copy them into a safe folder. And if you lost them, you can still copy them back. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Hi,  
Many thanks for prompt response. I am testing on broker [Pepperstone](/brokers/pepperstone "View Pepperstone Broker Profile"). Since it does not allow new version I am continuing with version 3 as Pepperstone has not updated MT4 version to 910.

Hi Abokwaik  
thanks for posting your new toy ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)... I like the concept of using the yen as a neutral currency to compare the others against..  
I m using it moore as an Indicator helping me with the strenght of the Pairs..  
Could you post the Dashboard as Indicator file (I dont like to have experts in my screen as a I trade only manually)?

Hi @all  
  
i have played with some timeframes and normal an reverse mode and some trading times. I have found a good variant to trade reverse mode when the market takes a breakout. After the breakout i will activate the EA on M5 timeframe with 3 trades per currency pair and max trades of 20.

Version 5  
  
Updates :  
  
Control on Loop Back Bars per Each Time Frame.  
  
For example you can set loop back bars to 10 for M5, 2 for H4, 1 for D1 and disable other time frames by setting loop back bars to 0.

Hi abokwaik,  
Is it possible to compile EA on MT4 built lower or 902 as many brokers still use built 902.

Hi abokwaik  
  
Is it possible to add option "do not open odder the same pairs after hit stop losses in the same session"?  
It would be help us to avoid big losses.

Hi adhipfx,  
I request abokwaik to provide sessional wise selection normal and reverse trading then we can make it autopilot! We appreciate if he develop code for this in the next revision. i.e. Each mode, Reverse and normal should have trading 4 sessions for setting trading time.

Hi Adhipfx,  
I tried to follow your advise of reverse and normal schedule today. My trades was running in reverse mode from Tokpyo+3 till NY open, While changing to normal mode there was floating loss 4% at opening of NY session. So in this case do we need to close all active trades in loss or allow it to run and open another chart with Normal trading

It was very weird.  
Today I start at 10:00 my local time. I won 2 baskets before NY open.  
After NY open I stay away from market because Prelim GDP q/q and CB Consumer Confidence.  
Maybe need more specific time and duration.  
My local time(GMT+7)  
10:10-20:00(reverse)  
20:15-23:30(Normal)  
23:45-03:00(reverse)  
  
My strategy if floating in loss before red news i will trade through red news if floating in profit i will close all trades

It has some slight differences, but is basically the same.

Hello Abokwaik,  
Thank for your amazing EA.  
Do you think it would be possible to see the max win and max loss occured during a session ?  
Have a nice day

this thread was the most intriguing idea of 2015. i still believe its all about apples to apples and oranges to apples, i.e. scaled in the same range.  
  
for example what would happen if we tried to use this indicator on all the usd pairs and only the usd pairs... then we would at least have a constant to compare to...albeit the changing value of the usd .... how can we make the value we compare everything to be permanent with a threshold absolute and not a moving currency value and have all the currencies line up in the same linear scale/range? possible? would that solve the problem of having the perfect indicator, that knows when a currency is truly weak or strong  
  
normalizing and/or standardizing each currencies data first before comparing them would be something to try.  
  
just some out of the box thoughts to hopefully inspire you guys help get us all closer to the truth  
  
thanks for listening

I've been testing this for about a week, (nothing extraordinary) but i thought i'd share my views so far  
  
All tests are using "Use Rank = True", 3 Loopback bars on everything with M1 disabled, (i also cut out CHFJPY as my broker doesn't support stuff like CADCHF)  
  
30min TF = I have found that this TF works quite well on normal mode. Reverse mode gives sketchy performance and shouldn't really be trusted  
  
15min TF = Doesn't work so well on Normal or Reverse it seems (for me anyway...)  
  
5min TF = Doesn't work at all on Normal mode, but shows promise on Reverse, however you will need to tweak the settings (max orders, and take profit and TP)  
  
i'm going to test 1 hour TF and 4 hour TF going forward, i believe i see what Khalil meant by not using a small TF, I think the puzzle would be to rely on normal mode and finding the right settings for this tool.  
The theory is thus:   
\- if you space out the trades enough, then you are buying the strongest currency against weakest, (still reactive trading), however, if you do this often enough you end up with a basket of different pairs that have at one point in time been the strong pair to buy or sell. but if you space it out too much then you will miss the breakouts., hence i will test 1 hour and 4 hour but not daily.  
\- if doing this on 5m - and normal mode, what happens is you are buy/sell strongest every 5min, but this might not be the case 1 hour later; which is why reverse tends to be a good option here  
\- 15m might still have potential  
  
\---------------------------  
  
Abowaik (Khalil) - if you are not too busy, would it be too difficult to add the time frame being used in the comment section? it makes testing a lot easier. right now it is either "ALL" or "ALL-R", if using 30min Chart, then comment could be "ALL 30" or "ALL-R 30"?   
because when doing multiple tests to check TF, it gets hard to distinguish between the winners and losers unless i specifically hover mouse over comments to show the magic number used...  
  
Thanks for the great EA btw

i wonder if taking uj out of the indicator/ea would improve the performance. The reason i think it may is because the other currencies are already partly made up of uj.... i.e ej = uj + eu gj = uj + gu etc. by eliminating uj you would perhaps then have pure yen power and much clearer picture... just a thought  
  
  
love to see if it works for ya  
  
kind regards

Hi Abokwaik,  
A wonderful thread. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
What are the best TFs and GMT times to trade using this EA including the reverse trade?  
I can see some have got good results using TF 5m and some are not. Some were successful in 15m, 30m and 1hr. The success comes along when trading in a correct market and in the correct time. Do you have specific markets and times for each of the pairs so I can change the parameters based on this?  
I am indeed thankful to you and all the contributors in this thread.  
Cheers.

Hi all,  
When I started trading this EA on my Demo (on 06.04.2016) it gave me a massive loss of 149.27 (based on TP100 SL 150 and all TFs were active). The next day loss went up to $194.00 on the same parameters. Then later on that day I changed the parameters to TP10 SL150 and only on M5 TF (please check the attachment) and left for overnight trading. The EA was so productive and made every basket of 10 pips closing on profits to the extent my previous loss of the day of $194 has recovered up to $56.06 loss (total profit of $137.94). Therefore rather than going for big profits with high risks it is best to go for 10 pips profit basket and continue on trading. hope this will help.

@[_abokwaik_ ](http://www.forexfactory.com/abokwaik) \- great EA you have here. I am already seeing great results from the tool.  
  
I just wanted to find out from your version; V05 - can you explain to us what optimal loop back bars for the 15min, 30min and 1 hour timelines.  
  
If you could also explain to us how this impacts the entry points for the EA.  
  
Thank you for your kind assistance.  
  
Keep up the good work.  
  
@All - you are welcome to jump and share your optimal settings that are seeing PIPs grow in your trading accounts.

I don't have the EA with me now, but from my memory, there is an input for Profit Target, once reached the EA will close the trades.  
There was also a closing time, regardless of profit/loss.

**This is version 6 of Y_Power EA, with the following updates:**

  1. Fixed a bug in SL/TP calculation (by reading Point using MarketInfo function on selected pair)
  2. Added an Initializing function to automatically retrieve sufficient history at the start.
  3. Added the used time frame to the trade comment.
