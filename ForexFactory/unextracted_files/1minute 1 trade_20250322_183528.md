This idea was only born 5 weeks ago  
  
It was inspired by my endless strive to have a system that just trades once a day   
  
My main system is doing well and this gives me the opportunity to fund other accounts  
  
I must stress that all my trades are placed with spread betting companies which I rotate in order ..I feel this gives me more shadows to hide in.  
  
  
The system uses a 1 min chart on EURUSD Ive not tried it on other swaps   
  
The basics are  

  1. We identify the trend Euro open to UK open with a mechanical process
  2. We then use 2 indicators to judge the best time to enter
  3. We always risk 5% of the account as a stop loss
  4. We always set our TP to 3 times our stop loss

Our risk reward is therefore 3:1  
  
We can have 4 losers 1 winner in any given week and be down only 5% on the account  
  
We can have 3 losers and 2 winners and be up 15% on the account  
  
Over the last 5 weeks I have placed 25 trades  
  
15 winners  
10 losers  
  
The winners gave me a gain of 225%  
The losers gave me a loss of 50%  
  
Overall gain without Money management gave me 175%  
  
My actual gain using my money management was 488%  
  
I will attempt to post rules and charts tomorrow PM..but please bear in mind I have only 5weeks of results

I'm sure there's a benefit to a 1 trade a day system. Less time, less stress, less is more. Waiting to see more.

Please dont forget only 25 days of data..this may well just blow up !!  
  
Ive always like the idea of taking just 1 trade and shutting down for the day, whats the points of getting financial freedom only to spend your life sting in front of a PC for 8 hours a day on your own  
  
Boredom kicks in, you start to gamble and play and suddenly the business plan is out the window money management is out the window risk control is out the window  
  
Pretty soon the PC is out the window!  
  
This system uses a very basic principle..Where’s the trend heading jump in on a retracement or rally. Very easy to say allot of traders try but when is the trend ending ? when technically has it started ? ..Hopefully we wont have to think about such things because that means analysing the market and speculation and that what im not into  
  
What im into is finding an edge, winning more on the winners than I lose on the losers  
Take every signal every day..  
  
**The system**  
  
  
****Step 1****  
  
  
Open EURUSD  
Set to 1min  
Remove all clutter inc grid lines  
We load …………Market_open_lines C  
We set to the correct times find a source that tells you what times the market opens in you part of the world and apply to this indicator  
  
We load a. …………Stochastic indicator 533 low/high simple  
Set 3 lines 20 ,50 and 80  
This will work with the MACD  
  
We load the ……..MACD _ 4Z   
The 4 colours help us enter  
Remove all horizontal lines  
  
****Step 2****  
  
  
Using your market open lines draw a line from EUR open to Euro close it hasn’t got to be super accurate it has to give the general bias of the market  
  
In this example the bias is up so we then draw a horizontal line on the low of the Euro session  
  
If this is broken before we get a signal we then look for a short.If its not broken then we continue looking for a long trade  
  
This is shown in Chart A  
  
****Step 3****  
  
  
We now need the MACD to go red this is going to help us find the best retracement  
Within the period the MACD is red we need the Stochastic to be below 20  
  
The vertical line in chart B shows this  
  
****Step 4****  
  
  
We now need the MACD bar to go from dark red to red as in chart C and we need the Stochastic to be below 50 at this point  
  
**Step 5**  
  
  
We set the TP and SL  
The SL is always 5% of the bank  
The TP is always 15% or 3 times the SL  
  
I do this calculation when we are 30seconds into the entry candle , its not exact as I like to enter on bar close some times Im risking 6% others 4% but the maths tends to level out over several trades and gives and average of 5%  
  
Also as Im using spread betting companies some times I cannot place my stop if its smaller than they allow so I have to watch and close manually. It’s the 1 draw back of 1 min trading  
  
We do not move our stop …we either win 15% or lose 5% if you start moving your stop and you start getting 5% win or 8% wins you remove the advantage you have with the risk reward  
  
This is shown in chart D  
  
The next chart will show the mechanics of taking a trade in opposite direction to the bias when the High or Low line is broken…… all the info will be on the chart  
  
My actual sequence results of the 25 days is as follows  
  
WWWWWLLLWLLWWWLWWLWLWWWLL  
  
Please do not get hung up on losing trades its why we use RR of 5% if you want risk 1% that side of things is up to you  
  
I started with £2,000 after 25 days I now have £9,773

Hi, Paulus. Would you mind posting your results in mt4 detailed statement? It would be easier to understand your system if we could compare your trades with indicator signals at a specific time. Thanks

There is only 1 hour's difference between the Frankfurt open and the London open.  
  
Your chart shows 2 hours difference.

Although its 5% of the account how do you determine the distance at which you place your sl? Is it just the swing low?

I think its like this: say you have 100 $ account. 5% of 100$ equals 5$. If you trade 0.1 lots, then your pip value is 1$ and your stop loss is 5 pips= 5$= 5%. If you trade 0.05 lots, then your pip value is 50 cents and your stop loss is 10 pips= 5$= 5%.

Good question. I think Paulus needs to revisit this. His times are wrong and there are no instructions on placing the stop.

Hi,   
I am a nubie in this trade and have blown away half my account. You know how agents hurry you into openning live accounts before you even know how to open/ close a trade. Your system here seems to be the simplest I have come across. My problem is with loading the MACD - 4Z. Is there a way I can re-set the existing one on my MT4 platform to give me the same results? Tried importing yours but instead everthing just disappeared.  
  
Thanks a lot!!

Look at Chart D. His stoploss is placed below the last swing low. That is how Paulus always does his systems. He is using a fib. tool to mark his initial stop loss position and then to indicate the equal step up/down until he hits his desired take profit area (3x in this case).  
Hope this helps.

That is correct my sl is always a couple pips above or below the swing low  
  
The distance from the swing lo or hi to my actual fill determines how much per point I can trade as long as I do not go over my 5%  
  
eg  
  
Account size £1000  
5% = £50  
  
Swing low to actual fill ( approx)= 12 pips  
Therfore I place a trade at £4 per pip  
  
If I lose I lose £48 if i win I win £48 x 3 ( 15%)

I cannot do that all my trades are placed with spread betting firms I use MT4 only for charts

Make sure you save it to C.prog files.MT4.experts.indicators   
  
Close then re open mt4

Doesn't would be simpler just to check the hourly candle of the Frankfurt session? If it's bullish, then buy bias, if it's bearish, then sell bias. The low of that candle would be the low of the session. So no drawing lines on 1 minute chart needed. Btw this method looks interesting, I will give it a try next week.

We surely can backtest this for longer data, however its alway a bit speculation in backtesting..for example : On my first test May 4 signal was short-win, on second short-loser :}} (Depending on entry candle I picked)

Hi Paulus,  
Thanks for the system - will be testing.   
  
This is a valid point made by billbss. Do you use an hour (7am GMT- 8am GMT) to determine bias or two hours? Because in your chart A you use two hours.  
  
It is my understanding that EURO open is 7am GMT and London Open is 8am GMT (only 1 hour).  
  
Just want to know so I can keep it consistently mechanical in testing.  
  
Many thanks

Based on the MM and R:R of 5%:15%, i see that lot size for each day may varies due to the different pip count for swing high or low.  
  
Maybe someone can code a script for Buy / Sell with auto lot size entry using last swing high or low based on the MM rules suggested?  
  
Hope i have expressed myself correctly...

Paulus,  
  
what are your average stop losses in terms of PIPS? just a ballpark would do the trick  
  
Seems like the stops are very tight... less than 15 pips (need very tight [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide")).  
  
only reason i ask is bc, US traders are only getting 50:1 buying power, so to risk 5% on 10ish pips, have to use almost 100% of our available BP. best thing to do is to create a sub-account, so that you can easily keep track and so your able to enter other positions.

Please correct me if I am wrong.  
  
Bias should be long given the open Frank and open London.  
  
Attached is a chart of the first long signal, which this time around did not work.  
  
Please comment Paulus if the set was right.  
  
Also, to anyone reading this, as Paulus suggested you will get losing trades, there is no holy grail, in this ocassion i was a loser.  
  
My question now is, if you didn't take the signal in the chart below, can we wait for a short signal if the low of the previous hour is broken.

Based on the rules, it should be a buy trade. However, i choose not to take it because H4 and Daily are showing downtrend, to me.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

You are one hour late....  
  
Check FF and you will see the opening time for all sessions in your local time.

Markets are considered "open" at 8 am local time. For London that is 7 GMT and 6 GMT for Frankfurt. However, today is a bank holiday in the UK.

Strictly according to the rules there was an entry before that one a couple of bars back. It was a loser as well. I marked it with the red vertical line in the chart below:

According to the rules there were 2 setups before the one you have shown. If we dont follow the rules strictly then the setups become subjective and the statistical win/lose ratio of the system is compromised.

I think the entry point for a shoth must be bellow the low between Frankfurt open and London open

Ignore the short on my chart - that is a different system. The LONG entry according to this system was marked with the red vertical line as I said.

my brief perusal of the rules:  
1] your only option at present is short (previous session bias is short)  
2] first short opportunity **729 GMT** @ **3006**  
3] SL @ 3035!?

I will be testing this system over the coming weeks/months according to the rules posted by Paulus on Page 1.  
  
Just wanted to say thank you to Paulus as well for his generosity to the trading community through this forum.  
  
I want to test 2 other pairs as well as E/U. These will be G/U and E/J. I will only take 1 trade per day on each pair and post all my results here with charts. Entry will always be at the close of the candle marked with a red vertical line. Stop loss marked with a purple horizontal line.   
  
Here are results for 7th May 2012:  
  
E/U - Loss 5% (chart already shown in previous post).  
  
G/U - Loss 5%

around 5-15 pips spread is added to calaculate the 15%  
  
I have mentioned about the sl in my opening page I do sometimes have problems putting one in the market  
  
ie sl 15 pips spread 3 pips = 18 TP x 3 = 54 pips

You cannot get spot on accurate entry on a 1min time frame using the last swing hi lo as a SL as the noise on the 1min is massive..hence the 3:1 RR  
  
Trade 3% risk gives you 33 losing days on the trot ..I will be looking at other MM systems which I will post today which might be better than the 5% or % rule

I wouldnt it 1trade per day ..and the 1st page syas take every signal if you miss the 1st trade you need to wait for the next day  
  
The results I have are only 25days long I have thrown this into the forum to perhaps improve and or help others ..even if one part of this system completes your own system then we have won and some one has moved forward

Thats fine just make sure you dont sit out for 10days because higher time frames remove 90% of the signals to take a 1min trade based on a 4 hour and daily chart is rather extreme..for me to use that I would need to be trading the 1hour chart  
  
I would rather use the 5min and 15min ..but I dont

Hi if I were to trade 2 I would pick 2 that moved opposite to one another not in symmetry..not too worried about spread as the actual TP is rather small really

Thanks. If you look at the E/J chart then the losing trade could have been missed if as a rule the red MACD bars had to go below a certain level before a signal was valid.  
  
This may be something to consider moving forward in the future but I want to give the system at least 50 trades (50 days) on each pair to get some kind of forward testing win/lose stats.

I get asked that allot..I cast many seeds only a few flowers grow lol..to be HONEST its about ideas ideas ideas..I never keep them to myself I would rather be shot down in flames AND WASTE NO MORE TIME ON IT THEN TRY TO USE A SYSTEM THAT JUST DOESNT WORK..  
  
iTS LIKE BRAINSTORMING i SUPPOSE.......... IF WE WERE ALL SITTING ROUND A LARGE CONFERENCE TABLE i WOULD BE THROWING ALL THIS STUFF INTO THE POT..SOME ONE MAY TAKE 3 PARTS OF 3 SEPARATE SYSTEMS AND USE IT TO MAKE A GREAT SYSTEM..

No. Your time zone settings are all wrong. You have London open time 3 hours too early.

sounds good to me..I sure many many good systm on this forum are given up for dead just because a draw down period is entered we have to try and not get sucked into the thought process of trying to acheive nice smooth equity flow we can try to control it but the beast will go where it wants we just need to make sure we the safety belts on

Yeah I agree, it's just these are the three pairs I like/know the best. Only E/U is live (small micro account) and the other two are demo anyway. If however the G/U (or E/J) gives better results than E/U after some testing then I would just switch to G/U live.  
  
I agree that trading multiple pairs which are correlated will just magnify losers (but conversely magnify winners!), however I would only trade this system live on one pair, whichever is performing the best according to current statistics.  
  
If anyone else wanted to forward test any other pairs then crack on!

Not that I Analise such things as normal procedure but often look at things more so in my past days really so Id stop beating myself up  
  
Today was a good looking entry...look at the other pull backs average on all 5 ...8 pips...our pull back was 10... it was a good setup just didnt work

Well said Jpr. So easy to pick out the good trades after the event but all you end up doing is fooling yourself when it comes to trading in the real world. Stick to the rules and look for ways to improve on the success ratio in real time. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/270c-fe0f.png?v=15.1)

It seems as if your open times are wrong, they should be 6 am and 8 am UK time (5 am and 7 am GMT)

There should be one hour (not two hours) difference between Euro open (Frankfurt open) and UK (London) open. Isn't it?

Paulus is using a 2 hour period before London open, please check his charts

Correct  
  
London open is always at 8am local time (currently 7am GMT)  
  
Frankfurt open is always at 8am local time (currently 7am in the UK and 6am GMT)  
  
Using a 2 hour gap between the European and UK open is incorrect

Yes he is, but that means that his opening price is also one hour before the Frankfurt open

Hi Paulus,  
  
Thanks for another wonderfull mechanical system.....  
  
Maybe we can increase the % wins if we enter only if the high/low of the signal candle is broken? Today we have a win, we need to test more.....  
  
Cheers

I know that Paulus likes to keep things as mechanical as possible and trendlines are usually very subjective,but we still might use them to filter some of the noise which we have a lot on the 1 minute timeframe.May be it's reasonably to take less signals and wait until the price touches the trend line.But that's just another thought.We still have to avoid the trap of over-optimisation.  
  
I also like the idea with breaking of candle's high.It's the best way to feel the momentum.  
  
Anyway,here's the screen.

perhaps tweak RR, 1:2, when SL is bigger

Hi Paulus  
  
Please clarify why you refer to the euro open as 6am uk time when it is 7am uk time. Is it just for the benefit of your chart set-up? I've noticed a few comments regarding this issue but no answer as to why.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f624.png?v=15.1)

buying Aussie on Monday (719GMT) was also a good trade  
  
buy @ 0149  
SL @ 0135 (3 pip drawdown)  
TP @ 0191 (+42)  
  
i think this meets Paulus' rules, except applied to Aus

I enter a small sell order for your system but it lose, however, I entered a larger buy order rightaway because I saw that base on One hour/one day RSI, It is low value which indicate market might bounce back, I guess that you might consider checking on higher time frame as well.  
  
Good job, hoping that someone write a order manager EA or script to enter order.

Id never go over 5min if trading 1min and you will always find an indy out there to confirm what ou want so be careful  
  
start mix and matching indys on different ime frame and each time frame will give you a differnt buy or sell

on euro there already 2 pullbacks and entry's and the price go back over the last swing high so that is a loss day!  
  
the system is same you also can toss a coin and you will because of the MM win! but only in the long time then you will have 50/50 win and loss, but your mm make the diff and you have tons of money!   
  
but thanks for the share of the sys Paulus, may that will change the win loss situation a little more to your side ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Hi Paulus,  
Thanks for sharing your system. Really interesting! I'm trying it now. Just opened a short at 3023 and put a SL at 3038 but not sure it's a correct SL calculation. I'm not sure how to calculate SL in this case, could anyone help please?

Looks like on that day, next trade would have been a winner...  
  
I find it very interesting to use the relation between Fra and London as a bias for long short.Never saw that before, marking the high low differential as a limit.  
I´m testing every signal, as per sytem, but every morning till I get that TP.  
Meaning more than 1 trade a day...as long as I don´t get bored.  
  
Thanks anyway Paulus..it´s fun..Your $ results are very attractive...as you can see, weré all drooling here in this forum...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f924.png?v=15.1)

That was right on London Open. Should have waited for next setup to happen. The next setup according to the rules was a loser anyway as well.

I will add my nine yards worth of rules..(Thanks Paulus)  
  
Trade in the morning as long as I have fun.  
Move stop to BE plus coffee money (2 pips), as soon as I´m way in profit,and comfortable, but not at TP yet...(that´s just for my peace of mind..and to maybe improve my bottom line)..  
From then on: either BE or TP...  
Fun Fun..![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f923.png?v=15.1)

this is the only trade so far for me, i'm short at 3023  
  
1:3 RR might be the rules, but it places TP just below support, perhaps 1:2.5 is more sensible  
  
........nevertheless, so far so good +15

Having your SL at 3045 is not where Paulus would place it though. He would place it behind the last swing high and would have been stopped out on that trade.

Hi Paulus,  
  
Great strategy, looks really promising.   
  
I have one question, how long should we wait for an entry signal before we consider not taking a trade for this particular day.   
  
For instance, if we're waiting for a breakout on the London open in one direction, and we don't get an entry signal before 10am, I imagine it would reduce the likelihood of making a winning trade if the entry criteria are first satisfied at 10:05am.  
  
Or is it the case, that over the 25 days you have tested the strategy, you find that the entry criteria are always satisfied within 1 hour of the London open?  
  
Cheers,  
L

according to the set-up rules, I believe there is now a short on Aussie @ 0134 (1001GMT)  
  
_* my preferred SL @ 0159 & TP @ 0059_  
_………..although perhaps not how Paulus positions SL?!_

Hi all.  
  
Thanks again to Paulus for another interesting system ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)  
  
Maybe I can shed some light on the confusion surrounding market openings.  
  
Up until the end of March Frankfurt open was 8:00am CET (Central Europeam Time) which was 7:00am GMT. London open was 8:00am GMT. 1 hour between openings.  
  
However then clocks changed for summertime. Here in the UK British summertime (BST) is GMT +1, but Europe advanced CET by 2 hours so now Frankfurt open is 8:00am CET or 5am GMT or 6am BST. London open is 8:am BST or 7:00am GMT or 10:00am CET. Hence the two hours between oprnings as shown on Paulus' charts.  
  
Hope this helps

Anyone know where Alpari UK get its timing from???  
  
Currenrtly 15:30 UK time

The MetaTrader clock on your platform will be switching from Central European Time (CET, currently GMT+2) to Eastern European Time (EET, currently GMT+3). The change will take effect at 0:00 EET Monday, April 2, 2012 (21:00 GMT, 22:00 BST Sunday).  
  
  
Hope it helps. UK office probably did the same.

I guess that it is not picky on 1 Hr before open or 2 Hr, I find that most of time, Market start moving 1.5 hr before London open.  
  
I might be wrong, I guess that his idea is that  
  
1). Trying to detect short term trend of London market before it move, That's why he uses 1 min chart to detect trend.  
  
2). Stoploss setting and profit taking setting are very tricky, I am very new, However, I still feel that 1:3 is to high, It should be adjust base on Dairy range, Recently day, It shrinks from 120 pips down to less than 90 pips.  
  
As what he say, He uses this system for only 5 weeks, it still need some tuning, Anyway, it is a very good idea, good job

Hi,  
I'm planning to backtest this strategy and will need confirmation that we always keep 2 hours difference between EU Open and London Open, during Standard and Daylight savings time. 

r u ready?

I dont get despondent about losers but many do ..get 2 -3 -4 losers on the trot and traders will close down and start looking again..If you have your risk reward in place this should not effect you  
  
Today was a loser but Im not concerned .. as you can see though the actual system is trying to pick rallies in a down trend

this system _may_ have an edge, but i need a large sample size before i can get enthusiastic about it.........as i'm sure is the same for you Paulus

this week i've found 4 set-ups (x2 euro + x2 aussie) Mon & Tues session:   
15% (+42), 15% (+60), -5% (-25), and 1 pending @ +29  
  
..........each using bigger SL (of 3 winners, max drawdown is 18 pips)  
  
in my view small stops is asking for trouble

The bias is calculated since two hours before London open to London open, so not broken the low.

Hi PeterE,  
  
Can I ask what criteria you are implementing to determine your SL levels? I assume from the figures you provide that Mon E/U SL was 16, Tues E/U was 20 and the Mon A/U was 25. I agree with you that the current method of SL setting is way too tight causing losing trades when winners are possible as your Mon/Tue results have proven.

Does Frankfurt open one hour before London? If so, then the low of the first hour WAS broken at the London open.

What makes you think I haven't read the whole thread? The rules for when to begin bias measurement is as clear as mud. My take is that the bias should be from when Europe starts trading to London open, not some confused discussion of "summer time".

If you want to do what Paulus does just use the two hours before London open.

Quote from post with the rules from page 1:  
  
"Using your market open lines draw a line from EUR open to Euro close it hasn’t got to be super accurate it has to give the general bias of the market"  
  
If EUR open means Frankfurt open, then that's 1 hour before London open. So Paulus was wrong in the definitions (or in the screenshots). Btw I haven't read clearly stated by him that you should use 2 hour before London open.

The reason he probably hasn't stated anything is because he knew his thread would be taken over by time zone/session discussions like nearly every other thread is.   
  
Why don't you just pick one for yourself and test it. Test it consistently for 20 days and post results. If it doesn't look good then try the other one for 20 days and see if it make a difference.

It doesn't matter which broker you use, Frankfurt and London start at the same time Monday to Friday. Check ( according to your local time):  
  
<http://www.forexfactory.com/> at the bottom of the page  
  
or  
  
<http://www.forexmarkethours.com/>  
  
If you cannot handle this by yourself, you should not be trading, period.

may I not write clear and all  
you totally right for the time, that was not my intention.  
but the price candle and was follow the price, the indicator will be diff. may your price break and other broker not and important also some will see a indicator above the 80 level but other not and so on.  
  
and this will by a sys what only trade 1 per day very funny, some make tons of $ and other blow the account ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

I've picked the Frankfurt open as reference and testing it since the begining of the week. 3 losing trades. Someone noticed that on one of Paulus's screenchot there was 2 hour time before London open - and so the guessing began. Only he could end this debate with stating clearly if the screenshot was bad or the "eur open" part in the rules is bad.   
  
Btw I've made a manual backtesting between the begining of April and 4th of May. There were 25 trades, 14 winner, 11 loser. The largest losing streak was 4 loss in a row. With the forward testing's 3 loss there is 50/50% win-loss based on 28 trades.

I agree. This discussion show up in most threads and tradingrooms over and over again. It never ends.  
Anyway, this link should make it clear when markets open and close (also Frankfurt) and then people can test if market open is the best or it is better to use two hours before London open. But the never ending discussion about timezones and market times should end now:

Zool, have you written an EA to back test this?  
  
Is it possible for you to back test over a longer time period?  
  
Cheers,

I have the template from Paulus and see at may 4, we have a loss of 5% because at was a long bias, but at your chart you have a win at a short trade.  
  
please can you check your backtest and tell us why  
  
cheers

No, I've done it manually. If I have some more free time I will backtest more months.   
  
I've used the following rules: check high-low 1 hour before London open. Stop loss is above/below recent swing high/low by 2 pips.

that said, this is meant to be mechanical.......not subject to discretion!!  
  
buy @ 2980  
SL @ 2960  
TP @ 3030 (1:2.5), & placing TP below potential resistance  
  
**confident it will be stopped** ,.......but let's see if we can keep discretion out of this

If the system remains at a 50/50 win loss ratio then it will be profitable because of the 1:3 risk reward ratio. Happy days.

I put the stop loss 2 pips above the swing high. The spread is 0.8 pips average, the stop loss was 1.31399 and the swing high after entry was 1.3139 so it was a close one but not a loss here. Maybe different broker/data feed can cause a difference in win/loss with such tight stop losses. I also thinking about that putting the stop loss more than 2 pips away from the swing high/low, about 4-5 pips seems ok to me. In the backtesting I saw, that there would be some trades that turned to winners instead of being losers.

It is dangerous when someone feels the need to post pips on this forum. If you want people to know how much you make that badly then set-up a trade explorer and let the results speak for themselves.  
  
All I want to do is give this system a good run using EXACTLY the same rules every trade in order to determine whether it has a statistical edge to use in my trading.  
  
With all respect - I don't care how many pips you make.

One of the main problems here is, that everybody sets another SL.  
There is no possibility to compare cause we have no fix SL size.  
  
  
  
just my 2 Pips

Plus he is still calling trading pairs "swaps." Newbies, watch out here, he is not trading interest rates paid by holding over nights, when he says "swaps" he just means pairs.

Hey Paulus,  
  
Everything is ok with your system style.  
  
Everybody who wants to trade this system has to find his own style, too.  
This is part of the game. Settings which are working for you, aren't working for everyone.  
Some people may put the SL 5 Pips over a Swing High - some people 2 pips. This can make sense - even in psych.  
  
I am testing your System with 1h between Euro and London open and i am feeling good this way. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Happy Pips!

This isn't a valid trade as per the rules, the stochastic was not below 20 and then it was slightly above 50 on the signal candle.  
  
Out of interest, did it reach your TP?  
  
Cheers,

See screen shot for entry. I'm taking the approach of a hard stop at 10 pips and take profit at 30 pips. Want to mix it up a little bit, since we have people testing a range of S/L and T/P combinations, some above the 5 min swing high/low others above the 1 min swing high/low.

Paulus & folks,  
  
I wonder if we could improve the profitability of this system by only taking trades in the direction of the main trend.  
  
For instance today looks like it could be a profitable trade, we will have to wait and see, but currently half way to my TP at +16 pips.  
  
We have gone short today and the overall trend on the 15 and 30 minute charts is down.  
  
Attachment shows down trend on 15 minute time frame.  
  
I would be interested to see how many of the losing trades you have had Paulus were against the main trend.  
  
Cheers,  
L

Moving forward I am going to just forward test E/U. It is too much pressure monitoring the three in the morning as the potential signals seem to come too close to one another.   
  
E/U is back to BE for the first 4 trades now anyway.

Interesting to see the vast array of results with this “system”.   
  
As far as I’m concerned Paulus’ “system” simply presents a “foundation for exploration”, just add your own personality; in my case tweak stops and TP.  
  
With that in mind, what if I just took **the first trade of the session only and on EU 1min** :  
Mon 15% (+60); Tues 15% (+55); Wed -5% (-20); Thurs 5% (+20) and pending  
  
………of course much bigger sample required

Stopped out at -10 pips, came really close to TP of +30, wondering whether using a hard TP of 30 pips is a bit ambitious on a 1 minute time frame.  
  
Currently working on an EA to back test this strategy, so will optimize the SL and TP values and post results here shortly.

Looks like the Stochastics may have gone above 50 when the MACD changed from dark red to red.

good to see you posted today's trade in real time .... answers any questions anyone should have.

Thanks for the system Paulus, like a lot of people, I am following closely.  
  
Also, the realtime post today is great. I have the same entry as Peter, so all looks ok and yes now we wait.

Hope this goes well and thanks for share Paulus.  
  
Find it interesting how if you draw the line from EU to UK open (sloping down right now) how well it acts as sup/res. Price has bounced off it 9 times right now.

I have been stopped -5%  
  
But for the week **+15%** ; with a tweak to SL, and just taking the first trade on Euro, each session.  
  
……..+15% each week, that would be enough!

Flimsy logic, 25 days of data and you are trading this daily! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f923.png?v=15.1)   
  
You really think 1 week of data means anything at all! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f923.png?v=15.1) This is just pure entertainment. You people need to wake-up and do the math.

Hi Paulus,  
Just noticed a little mistake in your results sequence. For the week just gone it was **LLLWL**. You sneaked in an extra loss on your sequence.

I am not knocking you and you have rightly warned people of the limited data which was the biggest hint you gave your followers to help you out imo. Your followers should be back testing this for at least 12 months. It's non-discretionary so a forward test day by day isn't going to tell you any more than a back test, which would be a lot quicker. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/270c-fe0f.png?v=15.1)  
  
You NEED this data. You need to find out its expectancy after several months. You need to know the max number of losses in a row in any number of successive months. You can then adjust your position size based on an average expected draw down. Or add to this data by looking at adjusting stops then gather the results. How does this affect overall expectancy.  
  
What about the logic? How does it consider for frankie hour fakeouts for example?

Ok then smart arse put knowledge to action and help the man out instread of providing daily results which are totally meaningless. I'd be very interested to know where the edge is. Good luck.

sorry porkpie your on ignore  
  
Ive had too many threads destroyed by such comments  
  
This is an experiment..the system will change if need be  
  
We do have an edge every one who attempts to trade with the trend has an edge because you will trading in the direction with many against those of the few  
  
Once we pick the trend we then pick the entry but done mechanically so we can be consistent.

Porkpie,  
  
Out of curiosity, what are the stats related to the Frankie hour fakeouts, I mean how often do they occur over a given period etc. Do you have figures?

As its sunday thi will be just a few ideas thrown in the original system will still be traded  
  
take a losing day last week  
  
take the hi lo of the previous session as always mark the direction as always.  
  
Now put a fib tool across those 2 points ..all very mechanical all very easy  
  
Our Golden Fib is 61.8  
  
As long as hi or lo not broken ... ( re look at other trend direction)  
  
then we wait until fib point hit use stoch to enter  
  
1st chart plot the fib  
2nd chart entry  
3rd cahrt another entry from this week   
  
I will try to check all previous signals but have loads of personal admin to do..

I am newbie few weeks for manual trading, For me, with my low manual trading skill level, no-way to win during USA session because price movement is so unpredictable, but I can win before London time as manual trading.  
  
I did test A free EA while ago which will do the same thing but trigger on opening time of USA, It will win big money before year 2009, After that , It doesn't work anymore.  
  
Since your have your manual system for Recently 6 weeks, I did quick visual test it manually from Last year   
  
\- Nov/11/2011 till Mar/14/2012 (16 weeks)  
\- It should win 45 times, Lose 36 times  
\- I use win 45 pip/lose 15pip method  
Or Win 2025 pip, Lose 540 pip,   
\- Therefore, Actual win 2025 - 540 = 1485 pips,   
\- However, I assume that each trade spread lose is about 2 pips in and 2 pips out, 81 trades = 324 pips spread  
\- Therefore, Winning = 1485 - 324 = 1161 pips,   
\- Since full 1 lot/ 10 pip = $100 profit, Player should win $11,610 in 4 months  
\- This Methods can be done by simple EA, However, I am not coder so I don't know how to do it.  
  
I hope that other people can see the value of this Idea, I understand that there are lots of waste your time systems around but you should do your test first, This system will not help you to Win big money in one day to Turn your $500 to 1 million, but you should win some money for long run without high skill level.

Did you adjust your times for non Daylight Saving Time, which would have been in effect during your test period.  
  
I know we are not supposed to discuss time, but I don't know how in hell it can be avoided for a system which is based on time. I don't know why it SHOULD be avoided.  
  
I have yet to figure that out.  
  
That's like discussing a zoo without ever mentioning the animals.

Good idea, It is a quick visual backtest, It is based on broker data which I assume that daylight saving time was done right.  
  
If it is a EA, you can fine tune it to sweet spot.

Most brokers make no attempt to adjust for time changes. They are based on a set GMT time. Alpari (I believe it is), adjusts.

Now add money management   
  
45 wins at 15% x 3 = 675%  
36 losers at 5% = 180%  
  
675 - 180 = 495% return on account  
  
starting with 2 k over 4 months  
  
2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = £32k now carry on for 12months .......£8M  
  
OR  
  
Add another swap now 2 trades a day !  
  
**Realisticaly** though you need to get the large trades in the market without major slippage for me thats using several spread betting companies as there is often a limit on the size you can go   
  
And I draw funds out to trade other systems rather than do back testing

It is my visual test, I based on broker time with free JF trading time indicator ( Easy for coder to add Daylightsaving) to show London opening time, It doesn't matter daylight saving or not, However, my visual backtest show that it should win.  
  
In Order to win, The (Homework) or key here are for player themself   
\- Find best winning sweet spot time visually  
\- Find best manual trading method (Base on their own style) for entry  
\- Find best Profit taking / stop loss setting ( for exit)  
  
Last week, I checked with free Signal posting from other forum as referenece with this method, I put order in @ london time, It turned 2 losing trades in winning.

I back tested this on E/U from 01-01-2011 to 06-30-2011 (6 months) and the results are very good: 47 winners, 81 losers (36.7% probability of winning). Expectancy=0.46, Standard Deviation=1.93, SQN=2.69, Profit Factor=1.7, MaxConsWin=5, MaxConsLos=10.  
With MM (SL=5%, TP=15%) would've made about 11 times return on initial account (aprox. 144/yr if extrapolated).  
I used 1 minute data from FXDD, adjusted for Summer Time. I tried my best to account for about 1 pip spread and to judge stoch under 50 rule, some of the trades are debatable though. Also sometimes the difference between the openings was few pipettes (1 pippete even, once), I stuck with the rules for this. Some SLs are 1 pip or even less. Too bad US traders can't use 5% SL (would've made only aprox. 40% per yr if 99% leverage used with 1:50). 

r u ready?

This was no setup to rules for me.  
U entered directly beyond London open, when the macd was darkgreen the candle before.   
According to the rules - how i understand them - u were one candle too late - so no trade.  
now looking for shorts.

we are all interpreting the rules differently, which is inevitable in the inital stages i suppose  
  
the close at 500GMT 2887 and the open at 700GMT 2889, indicates **no bias** for the session, which means no trade for this session  
  
.........for me at least  
.

4 pips wouldnt be a bias for me with this strategy  
  
and personally i'll be using experience to determine bias, i dont have a definitive rule to determine it at this point in time

no definitive bias at start of session, followed by clear break of the low (500GMT to 700GMT), set-up?......no harm in testing: short 2882, SL 2902, TP 2822

Equity £8618  
5% £430  
  
Result win £1,290  
Equity- £9,908  
  
  
Again I have to keep mechanical here I cannot look at bias and measure in pips  
  
  
I started looking for longs.......... 2nd bar of London open broke my lod of the previous session   
  
  
  
I then looked for short which means   
  
  
  
Macd Green stoch above 80  
This happened so then looked for change of green colour to denote down movement and check stoch at this point was still above the 50 level  
  
  
Trade was entered on spread bet and made its 3 x TP

My broker for the chart is Trading point <http://www.trading-point.com/>  
  
replicating trades will be difficult tomorrow you will have a signal I wont get..its swing and round about and comes even in the end  
  
I used to have a trading partner when we traded through a limited company .. we were trading Russell 2000 futures at the time and used interactive brokers on a 89tick chart  
  
Same broker same trading platform (IRT) but different houses differnt PC's we could never get our data the same  
  
I am puzzled at your stoch are you sure you have

thanks Paulus,  
  
yes you right can't really the same but nearly, because all datafeed also from the same broker will be diff to other people, it is not possible to send the same datafeed to all people, and there are also diff datacenter from the same broker, I here in asia have datafeed from the datacenter see belove the pic.  
  
but it is near better then from other broker.  
  
sure I have the same indicator value, see the pic, I show the data from yesterday, on the left side your tradingpoint broker.  
  
thanks and cheers

I understand there could be a little difference .... for me ([oanda](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile")) it was an entry and stopped out ..... lets wait for Paulus's official result and then we can update the result sequence.  
  
I really like this one trade a day philosophy, now that i think of it its something Joe Ross uses too and says it significantly improved his trading ..... one trade a day win or lose .....

where is your trend![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f923.png?v=15.1)  
  
you must take a TF and at nearly every TF the trend will be diff.  
  
the trend begin at the smallest chart the tickchart!  
  
but if you trade the TF M1 then look the trend there or at the next higher TF?  
  
have fun, I suggest make it easy have a KISS sys and you will be a winner.

Yes it does .... but all my threads show my evolution as a trader ..what I thought was important 12months ago doesnt rate so highly now as it did  
  
It has taken time but I now realise that good money management linked with risk control and risk reward on all the trades ....coupled with almost cold stone emotions makes for better trading

I also have other positions to manage and control  
  
For example toady I have closed out positions on   
  
EURUSD,AUDUSD, USDJPY, USDCAD, GBPUSD, USDCHF  
  
And still holding positions in   
  
EURGBP, GBPJPY, GBPCHF  
  
1hour time frames  
  
So I tend not to comment on positions intra day because mistakes that cost money can occur

mr. Paulus,

Hi, I am new and will try to follow this system as per rules. To give a little back to Paulus I'll post my trades however because of shift work I'll be unable to take trades every single day.

Just one question because I'm not 100% sure:  
  
Does the MACD have to go from dark red (green) do red (green) or from red (green) to dark red (green). Paulus wrote [here](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5640928#post5640928) that dark red to red is correct but it seems that it's the opposite in some trading examples.   
  
Have a great day,  
Mathias

For long --> macd goes from dark red to red.  
For short --> macd goes from green to dark green.  
  
A question for Paulus --> Why do you conside 2hrs (the time between the EURO open line to london open line). I'm asking because Form Frankfurth open to London open there is only 1hr?  
  
regards  
Alan

Hi Mathias,  
the red pullback mean in a long trend the MACD show weaker short candle, then the red will be from dark red to red at your trigger candle.  
opposite the green will be to dark green at the trigger candle.  
  
  
cheers

Hi lillelise,  
sure I see thanks :-)  
but I don't see it like you, if I trade M1, I give nothing on the higher TF trends.  
  
I make in M1 TF the most $$ in counter trend trades to the higher TF trend.  
  
and for this system I don't see some better results if you use the higher TF trend.  
  
for this system the easy rules are the best and the RR.  
  
cheers

I am newbie for few weeks, I checked both 1 min as reference as 30 min on RSI, Mcad, Etc, Those indicators are so confusing, It seems that 30min give me better results.  
  
Too bad, I can not stay up so late for london open, it is mid nite here, It is important hour to make money.

make a check - back test the last months what is going on at NY-open or after the Europe session close , there sometimes the Americans make some nice move.  
and if you find a good time to trade this system then follow it, that is like the breakout systems, first the start at Europe and later some one see also nice moves at NY or Nippon session.  
  
find your niche and make $$  
but it is not easy you need to spend some hours, weeks and sometimes more to find yours  
good luck! or change your lifestyle to work around midnight for you  
  
cheers, Im lucky in thailand now :-)

well, money/risk management goes without saying. that is the oonly key to success.  
  
but you should at least rerspond to the latest posts on your ''traffic lights'' thread regardless of whether you trade it or not. as people are expecting some sort of response in eagerness. i for one would like to see those questions clarified, otherwise what is the point of starting a thread then abandoning it.

Whatfx,  
  
Here I read your insistence that Paulus make a reply on a different thread. And yet you are guilty of the same thing. Below is an excerpt from a thread you started. And you have still not replied.

hi  
  
  
i havent forgotten. dont worry.  
  
  
problem is, there are way too many systems. to test each one takes a good length of time. i cannot list the systems until i have tested them fully and iam happy with the tests.  
  
otherwise i would just be misleading you guys.  
  
other problem iam finding is that once i have finshed testing the ones iam looking at, a whole load of new ones come out on forex factory. so i therefore need to test those ones as well, and that is what is taking up the time now.  
  
but i think i must call it a truce now, and just list the ones i have tested thus far, and just forget about the rest. otherwise iam never gonna finish this.  
  
  
so expect a list soon....  
  
  
thanks for your patience...

There are THREE PARTICULAR people in this thread you have to watch out for......, they are here for an agenda.   
  
You know who they are. You already got one of them kicked out, there are two remaining.!!!!!

Yes could well do perhaps enter on the 1min but pick 5 ir 15min swing for stop loss and then set 15% accordingly  
  
This was a very young project to start with

I can see a change coming on but would need to check all previous signals for it effect  
  
I like this idea its worth pursuing with your 3;1 RR you do not need a high strike rate

Hmmm  
  
Whats the point !!   
  
the point is to help if possible and share I hve started 50 threads if I was interactive on all of them I wouldnt get time to trade and I would be locked into my PC 8 hours a day..Im not a professional moderator   
  
When i start a thread I stay active if the threads dies down I pull back I am doing this for free lols

have i got the logic wrong here  
  
perhaps I should test EURGBP   
  
Euro is open thats what we are using for initial bias then if we trade the EURGBP as the banks open and market starts at 8am in UK  
  
perhaps using EURUSD is wrong I chose it purely for the low spread I can get on my SB accounts  
  
Perhaps if we set the bias between London Open and New York open as per normal with a single line and then trade EURUSD as the US banks and traders open  
  
So perhaps not 1 trade a day BUT 1 trade per day on 2 diff swaps at London open (EURGBP) and New Your open (EURUSD)  
  
Todays signal on EURUSD on start of NY session for example was a winner

following on this week  
  
EURGBP morning session trades 2 wins 2 losers  
  
Thats a gain of 20% on the account  
  
EURUSD afternoon session trade 3 wins 1 loser  
  
Thats a gain of 40% on the account

So as per your clarification London changed from GMT + 1 for summertime. So New Time is 9.00 AM GMT and Frankfurt not changing from 7:00 am GMT. so 9.00 AM GMT - 7.00 AM GMT 2 Hrs difference. Am I correct?

I hate to have to say this because I admire the effort you put into these threads and systems, but you know there's something wrong with your trading strategy when you start blaming it on the currency pair.  
  
And I would have thought tading the cross of EURGBP wouldn't yield much different results to GBPUSD or EURUSD over the long term.  
  
It might be more profitable this week, but I suspect, as with EURUSD, it will blow up over a period of time.  
  
As you said in your initial post, this system might blow up, I fear it has.

Thats not how it was meant to sound I was looking more of the Logic ..   
90% of systems blow up I have a profitable long term system that doesnt trade on gut feel or intuition or fundamental analysis  
  
This ststem has to be looked at and pulled apart a bad week doesnt blow a system but understand what your saying  
  
Trading 4 hours charts I agree the swap has no bearing but on a 1 min you need the bias and weight of the traders in that time zone on your side

Just my opinion but you are coming up with a system,it is being tested for a month or so,the results are good and yet you are already considering some changes.I dont mean to be negative but i dont think it is going to work this way.The combinations are unlimited.We can test 1 min,5 min, different stop losses,different R:R ratios,london opening,NY opening etc.The best way to find which one of these is best is by backtesting.Of course we would need ages to do that because we need a good sample and the combinations,as i said before,are unlimited.  
So,in order for this to work and in order that we dont change the rules every two weeks,an EA is needed.It will allow us to backtest any conditions we like in a matter of minutes.The system is purely mechanical and i dont think the EA will be too hard to create.Unfortunately, i dont have the technical expertise to work on this but,if anyone can, i would be glad to help.

Please please Im not the sort of trader that changes to suit market conditions perhaps I should of kept my thoughts to my self..I was thinking out loud  
  
The purpose of running any system in real time market conditions now is to see whats happening and how its happening  
  
I still have an open account with my sb companies regarding this system   
  
I had a loss today and it will be recorded as such

Mr Paulus,   
  
What is your opinion regarding this post. I think we could eliminate some fake entry. Today i tried with this. But it triggered my SL. Anyhow it is good.

yes I can see the logic of it..I would need to check all my existing trades  
  
and you would need rules to cover what if situations  
  
What if your looking for a short and the low of the signal candle doesnt get broken on that bar but does 2minutes later ?  
  
It requires some thought

This system is simple, but thread comments indicate it’s being over-thunk.  
  
Now I’m well aware the system is in test mode and _we need a much bigger sample_ , but following the system as initiated by Paulus, plus the simple tweaks below, my results for the past 9 sessions:  
  
Wk1 15%, Wk2 6.5% and 1 pending currently at 5%........plus, one session remaining for the week.  
  
For a mere 15min effort each session, I’d happily accept a weekly average of 15% on an account; my bank manager offers me a poultry 5% pa!  
  
Tweaks:  
\- I take the first trade "_that I see_ " in a session, and the first trade only, on the Euro  
\- I’ve increased my stops as previously detailed  
  
  
_* having said all that i'm well aware this system can fail, and i'm actually expecting it to_ ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Really? If it wins tomorrow, then won't it have been profitable over the last 2 weeks?

Herewith i attached screenshot of my 1st trade Yesterday. My 1st order was failed. I placed my order in 2nd dark green Macd bar which break 1st dark green signal. Again i entered the trade in 3rd dark green signal which again break 2nd dark signal low and i recovered my loss. I know rule is 1 trade per day. But i think we can retry untill 1st time MACD green bars going into downside.

In what way the process is mechanical we are not saying 'I think the EUR looks weaks so Im going to sell'..  
  
  
The process is mechanical all my trades are based on the same rules and nothing has changed what you see in the thread is a disussion on future possible changes ..isnt that what we do here..I did state in my 1st page this is a new born..not a tried and fully tested system

Since the system is sort of new then it is normal for the author to think how the system can perform better. So I would like to urge you to keep thinking loud and please continue to share your ideas here. If the way you are improving the system does not suit others so what, it is their problem not yours (dogs keep barking but the caravan keeps moving).

In London Open we have to test EURGBP where in NY Open we have to test EURUSD.

Paulus, I like the clear-headed thinking premise behind this thread. i.e non-discretionary, once a day, win/loss ratio, simple parameters (is-it-is or is-it-aint.) I recommend a reading of Mark Douglas - Trading in the Zone. It comfirms the logic of Paulus's approach.  
  
I also like it when you "think aloud." Why not? Thinking aloudn in now way implies a broken system, but it means we are seeking to improve. Otherwise there would be not purpose to the thread.  
  
So, here is my "vocal think":   
  
The addition of Stochastics and MACD color is elegant and simple.  
  
However, Stochastics is only accurate in ranging markets. Thus, how about using ADX < 25 (pointing downwards) as a final filter.  
  
I am surprised no one has back-tested the system manually for a few months. It should be easy enough. Just requires of that fleeting stuff called time.  
  
All constructive comments welcome.

Here i spotted the last signal (I didnt take, I started 5 min ago testing this system):  
  
[](http://www.subirimagenes.com/imagen-fgf-7705002.html)[http://s3.subirimagenes.com:81/image...7705002fgf.png](http://s3.subirimagenes.com:81/imagen/previo/thump_7705002fgf.png)  
  
Is a good signal at the moment, but notice that the next macd bounce is more deep and it results in a better signal because we can use a tigher stop loss and therebefore a tigher take profit. So i was wondering about putting a horizontal line in the 0,0003 and -0,0003 of MACD and only consider bounces which are higher than 0,0003 and lowers than -0,0003. Im gonna test both in two differents account and let's see how works.  
  
BTW, since we are using indicators, we can programme some alerts and not to be all day looking for entry. Maybe I find some macd with mail alert and connect my mail to the blackberry, so I only look the bias of the market and then wait to the messages to look. I have couple minutes to put the order if this happens.

This logic is good it will workout. It can help avoid bad signal. I am going to test with this.

Using ADX leads to loose many signals. Most of the time ADX is > 25 Can you expain in detail.

Brilliant!  
  
Before I go on rant, just wanted to thank you for sharing.  
  
After spending nearly 2 months of every waking hour (well, almost :nerd:blush: tracking the eurgbp, London session progress, I did notice that it is almost always most active during this session. I did come up with a one hour strategy that was quite profitable. The only problem was that I live in US and the strategy requires one to babysit the charts from LO 'til one hour prior to NY open. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f634.png?v=15.1) No can do.  
  
So I will be having a look at the eurgbp LO progress, and the eu NYO and keep you posted.  
  
Meanwhile, I'll be having a go at the audusd & audyen, somewhere between Tokyo open and Singapore open. They are traditionally the best movers during that time period, due to patriot trading times and aud & cny news releases.  
  
Thanks Again,  
Darryl

Hi Gurukrish:  
  
I am newbie, I am wondering that what is the meaning of 13 tradable pairs in London Session?, Also, Why it is a good idea to trade AUDCAD during that session? Both countries/brokers who interests in their currency not there.  
  
How are they relate to this "once a day trading system"?

Paulus has provided us with some very salient trade set up potentials. This could be a foundation for something very powerful. Thoughtful detail applied here, will serve us all well.  
  
I am currently exploring AudUsd set ups from Tokyo open, but more so shortly after Singapore open, which is 2 hours later. What I'm seeing so far is promising but much more testing is required here.   
  
@ GuruKrish:  
I'm looking at other pairs and market times as well. I do have some general ideas but testing takes time.   
  
Do you have any sort of record of W/L's for any of these pairs?  
Thanks,  
Darryl

I searched through web and filter it to 13 pairs which is active all the sessions. But every site suggestion is vary from each other. Do you have clear list of which pair most active on each session? which pair active on overlapped session?

Not even close. This type of research is slow and methodical. I've spent several hours on euro & eurgbp, only to find out that the template provided by Paulus was not in sync with my brokers time.   
  
However the time I spent was not a total waste. I did notice various patterns that occur, while watching for the proper "Paulus" set ups.   
  
Some of the key things I like about the indies Paulus in using, is the fact that with the MacD he uses only the bars. Also the settings (5,34,[5]) are the same ones that Bill Williams (Awesome Oscillator Guy) uses as a way to locate wave 3 for Elliott Wave analysis.  
  
The Stoch is also an indie I find useful. This is my first time using the 5,3,3, and I'm impressed with Paulus selection of it.  
  
I have been testing some modest variations of Paulus method. At this time it could, very well be, too confusing for me to add more variables into a simply straight forward method, so I will let that subject rest for now.

MT4 has it's own built in strategy tester. The only issue is it requires an EA (as far as I know) in order to properly test the parameters. Also, it's a Royal Pain to understand.  
  
Other than that you can try a product called forex tester. It is not free, and I have not used it. However people I respect recommend it.  
  
Other that that, I can tell you that you will learn **MUCH** more about this method by doing the grunt work necessary to observe what is really going on with the price action surrounding this methodology. Especially if you have less than a few thousand hours of face time with the charts.

The stop loss is too high!  
  
5%!?  
  
You should use a stop loss of just 1% of the balance, per trade!

I am newbie with 7 week of trading with poor English and I am hoping to find a good Forex MT4 simulator, I tried Forex tester but it is not 100% MT4 comptiable, It means that I can not use those really good MT4 indicators.  
  
I tried many free EA, 90+% of them are suicide blow your account EA, most of them worked well at once time but Since market was change, they are out, However, I managed to find one dead free EA after I backtest in visual mode to see those fail trades, I modify it and I use it as Semi-EA, it make so much money in demo account for just 1 week, however, It will not work that's well in live account due to broker server " Requotes" problem, MT4 is a very poor platform for EA, so limited in power almost impossible to put AI power in it. ( Well In Forex, Somebody have to be loser).  
  
I don't do well in manual demo trading during USA session because too many big boy with those choppy price movement and I end up as a loser but I do well in London session however, I work daytime and I can not stay up that late, I live in Canada.  
  
For Paulas System, I like it simple, in theory, Since Dairy range of EURUSA is about 100 pips, Basically, you can put either/or both buy or sell (or limit) order with profit of less than 50 pips, it has 50% or more chance to Win. by using MCAD to detect the short term price movement, It should have even more than 50% chance to win plus tight stoploss to limit your lose for blow up your account, it is quite safe.  
  
I might be wrong, Since this system, It supposes to detect price trend movement till USA session ( 5 Hours time), Beside using 1 min MCAD chart, I agree with other user that checking OB/OS 0.0003 value( sorry I am not good in MCAD but good for Stochastic), Also I will check for 15/30 min chart to double confirm OB/OS state, Since it is more accuracy in that longer length of time, If they don't agree, it will be higher change that market don't go longer trend and it will go sideway and It will trigger stoploss and end up losing money.

**This is not stuff from the precise rule book of Paulus "1M 1T".** This comes from my personal research and observation and is **My Opinion Only** ;  
  
\- In tracking price history on a few pairs (EU, EurGbp & AudUsd)   
  
• Losses are counterbalanced significantly when the stop loss is moved to BE once price has achieved 50% of target less the spread. In other words; If your spread is **2** pips, and your stop is **10** , then once price has moved **15** pips from your entry, stop is moved to BE. In my limited testing, this has impacted losses more than wins by a large factor.  
  
• Targets set at 2.5 times risk, have a greater likelihood of being realized.  
  
i.e. In tests I've been conducting on the AudUsd during the Asian Session, the results for 18 trades using 3X's or bust would have been 6W's & 12L's which equates to +180 and -120. Doing this ratio day in and day out is not bad at all, in fact better than at least 80-90% of all other traders, if you believe the figures on percentages we are told.   
  
So, for the very same AudUsd A/S trades;  
• 3:1 Totals ..........180 to 120  
• 2.5:1 Totals .......... 250 to 70*  
..* AudUsd A/S rule I used for SL is Most Recent Swing Point +or - 5 pips. In other words; if my entry is _short_ @**50** , and the swing is **53** , then my stop would be **58**(**3+5**). That would put my BE point at **1/2** of **20** (**2.5X's 8**) which would be when bid price reached **40**. Even though my profit target would need to reach **28** for this trade to be a winner if my spread =2.  
  
I have seen similar results on EU & EurGbp.   
  
**### Of course these results are limited sample sizes and By NO Means something that should just be followed Blindly. As with any method thorough observation and back and forward testing should be used.**

I did have a win today but must confess placed the SL 1 pip above the hi of the EU session this was only 2 pips higher than my normal swing hi stop position  
  
Mt entry may be a bit diff to you guys as I use a spread betting company to place the actual trades and they differ slightly  
n  
  
I was filled at 1.2775 with my SB  
MY stop loss was set at 1.2790  
  
Therefore my TP was 790-775 = 15 x 3 = 45 pips  
  
Or 1.2730

for me, the profitability of the original strategy hinges upon a tweak of the SL.......ie., bigger!

I am not coder but those EAs are really simple, Well, Just able to modify a old dump EA to test EURUSA for 6 month data, It seems that Paulus setting is right, For Stoploss, It is best near 16-17pip, while profit taking is near 45pip to 50 pip, best entry time is near 30 min to 1 hour after London time, However, It needs human to look at chart for best decision for bigger profit.  
  
However, With very limit data, AUDJPG is better than EURUSA, For 4 weeks data, best setting for stoploss is 18 pip while profits 52pip at AUD market open time, It might be good for your guy to enter order before sleep.  
  
EA is very limit in power, Human can do better for pattern reconnization while EA can do very fast ordering with many small tweak.

Am in the same timezone as u. I believe you hv to set it as per your MT4 time (your broker server time) not your local time.   
  
My broker server time is GMT+2.  
  
Current London timezone is GMT+1, London open at 8am London time.  
  
my setting : 7am to 9am (GMT+2)   
  
Started to test this strategy last Thursday so far WLW

I am not sure someone upload it here or not, I use this indicator, Put them in your MT4 Indicator folder and in MT4 indicator menu, Select them, it will show your Europe open time and London open time as well USA open time Etc.  
  
I guess that someone might mention here before, Although this method looks very simple and it is still working, However, it needs some skill on trend detection for London market open which a newbie might not be able to do it right. I checked in 2008, There was many simple methods worked, However, Might be people's Forex skill improved? many of them do not work anymore. ( This for other user)   
We are here to make/win more money, it is your job to find it, If this method work for you, keep on using it, If it doesn't, find another one but do not waste time to blame for whoever share it.

Punisher, if you were using the EUR/USD, I can not see how you lose money on May 23rd euro session.  
Direction is down.  
After London open, the price stayed around 1.2670, never went up 1.2680  
Using reading of MACD + Stock, there were many entries around the 1.2670 level.  
Went down 60 pips. Never hit the stop.  
Might be another currency then.

Interested to see how you determine the trend to be down during the two hours prior to LON open on EU! Strange.........VERY strange.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f612.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/231b.png?v=15.1)

Scarlet, the difference between the two opening prices was 2 pips on my platform. This is not a trend, this is really flat.   
So if the 1mn does not give me a direction, I look at the EUR/USD using higher time frames. The trend on higher time frames was not up.  
Nothing strange in my opinion, a 2 pip difference in 2 hours is not, in my opinion, a trend.   
If one decides to call this a trend, this is fine. I will not argue.  
But at the end of the day, somebody made money , somebody did not.   
One should, at least, ask the question why.

There was no trend direction over night irrespective of what time frame you were looking at. The net difference between Aus open and Lon open was only 9 pips. Not enough to warrant calling a trend direction either given the time scale. If you have some insight into how to help those that are having difficulty emulating the 'somebody' that is 'making money' please share it with all of us. Empty statements and making insinuations that others don't even know what pair they are trading is nothing short of ludicrous.

Here you are, I modified version 1.6 first which someone badly modified with mistake, So test results is slightly different, but Ver 1.3 is exactly what we need here.  
  
Sauron1.3 use 4H MA to detect trend plus MCAD, not as good as human eye and brain.  
  
For detail information on how to use it, Please read

It is exactly like the day before yesterday, Those Chart reading is tricky, Also, When you asked broker about chart reading for up and Down, If he is good as that, He should be Daytrader but not broker(I guess that it is stressful to hear angry customer yelling).  
  
I guess that martket change, Even I tested those EA robot, After May/15, few testing profitable EAs lose money.

Thanks Peter  
  
I couldn't post last week myself due to personal reasons ..  
  
It was a good week   
  
Its amazing how many traders give up .. they set up their 1% risk with 3 x reward TP and stop after 3 losing trades because they think some think is going wrong   
  
As Edison once said  
  
**_Discontent is the first necessity of progress._**

Let's forget the stupid mass and concentrate on the system.

Hi Paulus,  
  
Try use Moving Average 60 with default settings which is equal to MACD. Why you trade in the middle of MACD which maximum leads to fake entry leads to loss. when the bar open above the MA try buy and the bar open below MA try sell.

Hello Paulus,  
I've just started to test Your strategy and I have a loser today.  
I've done some research and made some conclusions.  
  
I try to make 2 trades a day.  
  
First, following Your strategy and second reversed.  
  
When Your strategy tells us BUY we wait for BUY signal from MACD and stoch.  
But when after 8:00 GMT we have a SELL signal only from MACD we take it too.  
  
This give us a two trades a day.  
Following Your MM we have 3 scenarios:  
  
(For both positions lot is calculating from the same start of the day deposit)  
  
1\. LOSS, LOSS - -10% (5% + 5%)  
2\. LOSS, WIN - +10% (15% - 5%)  
3\. WIN, WIN - +30% (15% + 15%)  
  
From my little research the second scenario has about 90%.  
  
This is for now. I write some more later.

Basically, more trades, more money, It is a good idea to place a 2nd order after London open, For first 1 min to 30 min, There are impulse buyer causing surge in price movement, after that, it should back to what they should be, The tricky part is that, what profit/lose setting will be for 2nd Order.  
  
I am newbie for 8 weeks in Demo training in my spare time and make mistakes and learning, I am on difference time zone so I can not play London market which is easier to play, I start with $5,000 demo money, Once it was up to $6,500 and down to $2,000 2 weeks ago, but now, it is at $18,000+ after 100+ winning trades. (I am not using Paulus system but more trades more money).

Looks promising, I would throw a Momentum indy with ADX into the mix! Give me a whos in charge and strength of the push. Works well with MACD.

I know it looks good on the chart I attached but I try that before and the results wasn't acceptable for me.  
But when we look at Macd and Stoch this may give very good results. Unless thats what I think. Maybe yes, maybe not. We see.  
  
I just wait for tommorow.

So, O_s_a your charts are GMT+2 and the start of the London session is shown by the vertical red line? Also, the arrows show the relevant SELL/BUY candle?  
  
Thanks

Sorry, but I think I'm losing the plot. Can you please clarify that on the 29/05 you say your long trade succeeded and your short trade failed?![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f624.png?v=15.1)

Just wondering why you bought on the second entry? It doesn't really meet any of the criteria as to how paulus states to enter a trade (ie no macd pullback into red for a buy)

You said "I am not using Paulus system but more trades more money." What system is that, or is it your version of expanding and testing Paulus System?

I think the entire idea of "1minute 1 trade" is to free yourself from sitting, staring at a screen, for only one trade. Adding more trades, I believe, changes the philosophy to many minutes, many trades. There are a lot of trading systems like that already. That's my 2 1/2 cents. The 1/2 cent is for "what do I know."

Hi,  
  
I have been trading for several years, but never downloaded and used a trading system.  
  
How do I load:  
  
Market_Open_Lines c.ex4   
MACD_4CZ.mq4  
  
I keep getting messages that want to find a program to open them.  
  
I am very computer literate but this has me stumped.  
  
Thanks,

Do I merely copy Market_Open_Lines c.ex4 and MACD_4CZ.mq4 into a folder.  
  
Will that folder be the name of my EA.  
  
I could really use more help.  
  
I have been using an MT-4 account for a couple of years. I understand using it. I just never loaded a trading system piece by piece.  
  
I would appreciate any help.

Worked like a charm. As you said, is also helped having MT-4 off, which I didn't,  
  
Thank you so much,

Under Step 2, When loading …………Market_open_lines C  
When I set to the correct times find a source to the market opens in my part of the world . . . . I see times  
ISidney Open 20, Tokyo 23, as defaults. Is that 20:00 and 23:00, in GMT?

I'm sorry PeterE, I don’t understand.  
  
Is that 500GMT Euro Open and 700GMT London Open?  
  
If so, what about the other opens and closings that the system calls for.  
  
I am confused and have been trying to use the system for a few days.  
  
Thanks,

rough calculation, you are at 600% in 10 trading weeks or 50 sessions

Just an observation  
  
here is a losing day this week when the EU session is don and the london opens and goes up...not allot you can do  
  
If you look at the Lower low ...Lower Hi counts ( definition of down trend ) it all looked good.  
  
Before our short signal came along we had just had a higher hi technicaly breaking the sequence of our down trend..although in any trend if course this will always happen.  
  
Perhaps this type of signal should be ignore untill the last lower low at 1 is broken again and our down trend resumes ...we then look for our short  
  
In this case it didnt and we take the next long..  
  
Just **a thought** not a rule change !

another perspective  
  
since you introduced this strategy at FF your account has grown 25% in 5 weeks from 9773 to 12262 (first 5wks = 489% growth, second 5wks = 124% growth....from original 2000 TC)  
  
indicating that the first 5 weeks, pre introducing your strategy to us, were more profitable than the most recent 5 weeks  
  
considering your 600%, i thought perhaps smaller SL and TP is more profitable, but having assessed the first 5 weeks against the second 5 weeks, as well as my own application of your strategy over the past 5 weeks or so (44%), not yet convinced about smaller stops  
  
that said, you provide me with the results for the tighter stop strategy, which is a handy comparison  
  
hope that's not too convoluted

you remind me of my old trading partner ..  
  
he was a record keeper I wasnt its my biggest flaw I just trade   
  
I understand your reasoning about the stops ..it could well be 100pips away from the actual fill we get as long as its 5% of our account and we book 15% then thats fine but that would require a 300pip move..  
  
Im thinking more along the lines of   
  
A - The initial entry is not accurate enough  
B - We need to look further at potential movemnet when London opens in relation to what Europe has done or indeed Asia and Europe has done  
  
For me it needs to be mechanical and logical   
  
Its a tough one   
  
But not complaining ..one thing though as the stakes get bigger 1 trade has to be split amongst 2 or 3 spread betting companies that makes my life hectic in that 1 min .. 5min is just to long I think as trading opportunities may pass its a pity we cant have a 3min chart I used nothing but when I trade index Futures but that was on a different plateform

i'm thinking if you (and me to!), can make 600% each 10 week period,.........just leave things as they are

Geoff, i have continued to use the 1:3 risk reward, but have changed the stop position, ie. a lot further away from current price action, above resistance if short, below support if buying. My stop position is subjective, no black/white rules.   
  
Other than that, all is the same.  
  
If you look at the trades i've listed here at this thread, you'll get the idea.

Just another thought not a rule change just my little grey cells working  
  
Peter.. Hope you dont mind me using you but as your post your entry etc Im just using you for this exampe hope you dont mind  
  
ATR average true range  
take the last 5 days ( 1 week ) divide by 5 we have the average move  
  
If the avarge for the day is 200 pips and we eneter a short when it has already moved down 180 pips from the days high irrespective what session that was done in and our target is 50 pips below the low of the average true range then the odds of us getting our TP must be reduced..after all the swap would have to perform or move more than its average over the past 5 days.  
  
here is the chart for Friday on a daily time frame  
  
Top line - hi of Asian that day  
  
Red - My Fill  
Green - Peter E Fill  
  
Black line this is the 5 day ATR - notice how the low of the day almost to the pip reaches it then stops  
  
Lower black Line - Peter E TP .. below the average true range  
  
I have seen an indicator on FF that will plot 2 horizontal lines on your chart showing the ATR for that day but for the life of me I cannot find it

I was looking at your chart, and the way it hits a low, retraces and hits almost the same low looks like a double bottom pattern. This could be the reason for that massive breakout. If I shorted it down there I may have shat myself.

Nice signal angled line represents the ADR that day Hi of day at A was 4 pips from the predicted movement

It was a clear downtrend but since the high of the trend was taken out I then waited for a long opportunity. It all ended in a loss. This is based on the rules.

I suggest people to trade only when the trend is clearly visible (trought this strategy trend identification method), and when are no doubts about the stochastic 50 level pass, and a clearly big MACD body.   
  
Don't throw yourself into all of trades only because the signal has appeared. Use your brain, and trade the signal only when you're sure that its a good signal.  
  
I saw a lot of false signal due to the tiny MACD body. Be patient and this will work.

just follow the rules, dont over think it,   
  
if you have to apply discrimination here-there-and-every-where, it's defeating the modus operandi of this largely mechanical method

Each to their own and no offence jonander50, but I agree with PeterE in this situation. At this stage without any solid evidence, I would say you run just as big a risk of missing the winners if you try to pick and choose.

With any mechanical system you are trying to do the following   
  
Eradicate emotional involvement with the trade  
The emotional involvement is the biggest cause of a trader losing  
  
With a mechanical system we have 2 choices we trade we dont trade ..  
  
The lights are green the lights are red  
  
Every signal has to be taken every day esp with a risk reward of 3;1  
  
If you miss a trade and that trade hits it 15% TP and the next trader doesnt one account will be wining the other losing  
  
Rule 1 should really of been Dont carry out any Analysis on the signal...if it qualifies then trade it if it doesn't then dont

I think this script would be useful

Just drag the script below current price to the place of your desired stoploss.  
It will open buy and put SL to the price you dragged to. The TP ratio is the prof parameter of the script.  
  
Opposite true for sell.

Strange. It works fine for me, maybe some setting in mt (allow import dll for example).  
Check the log tab, mine have such strings then script executed:

Trade yesterday went to around 10% in profit Im never tempted to close start closing at 13 or 14% instead of 15% and a month down the line your closing at 10% and your risk return is all screwed  
  
New traders will smaller account start with a 2% investment in each trade  
  
IE £500 bank x 2% = £10 risk  
  
Use Micro account then mini then main  
  
Trading at a lower % RR = relaxed emotional free trading  
  
I still believe that this system will make constant money and I still believe it can be improved on ..2 wins per week would give 60% growth per month without money management I think when you use MM you could double or treble that

Downtrend heading for confluence below. I'd feel more confident if the daily pivot is broken before a trade signal.  
  
Uptrend on 15 minute. 15 Min Trendline and daily pivot in confluence as well as a S/R flip pivot zone

Hello Paulus  
  
Thanks for all your work done. I guess this trading methode works.   
Nevertheless, can you explain today's situation on a chart? Is it a short setup?

I've been following this thread since it first started, so I'm wondering if you don't use MT4 can you setup the graphs up like Paulus mentioned.  
  
Trouble is i'm new to Forex and learning and i'm just using the standard java graphs that ETX Capital provide.  
  
Also thanks to Paulus for sharing this trading system.

hmm, 15% on that today and in reality probably just missed 15% using 5min yesterday, very close though, a couple of pips.  
  
...some testing to do.  
  
Edit: ..in fact the 5min short was a winner yesterday. Using 5min this week would have given 4 winners, 1 loser using 1:3 (risk/reward) and 66% gain with fixed fractional MM and 55% without money mngt. 100% winners at 1:2 but 5% less return than 1:3.

Todays SL was hit on the short.  
  
SL is a few pips above/below the swing high/low prior to or at the signal candle

I always do 3 x Sl to fill + spread  
  
ie   
  
SL to fill price = 12pips = 5%   
  
therefore 15% = 12 x 3 =36 plus 2 pips spread ( your paying 2 pips of spread not 6 )  
  
Not 12 x 3 + 2 spread x 3 = 42

Don't know if that would be a valid entry based on the original rules. Something about if the high or low of the pre london timeframe is broken we look for opposite directional trades. I might be wrong but again we're testing this and if it works otherwise so be it. Anyways good trade and good find.  
  
Thanks

Well, This is a simple system, I like simple system, I am no brainier.  
  
For my own opinion, We have difference background, you can use any method that you are good as to test.  
  
I am not using this System because I am on other side of world, I am using semi-EA to assit me.  
  
Hehe, If our Target is winning some extra money, I think that if you are really bad in looking at chart, you can cheat little bit by looking as some good post on EURUSA  
  
I find that in Babypips.com, There are one good guy James78, He posts almost 4 days a week to predict EURUSA just 1-2 hour before London open, his system is very close to Paulus, His post is like this  
  
====================================  
Daily Forex Predictions for June 15, 2012  
(update: 08.55am GMT+7)  
  
EUR/USD  
(last price: 1.2621)  
BUY first, entry = 1.2630, SL = 1.2590, TP = 1.2670 ( 40 pips stoploss 40 pips profit)  
if wrong, then SELL, entry = 1.2590, SL = 1.2630, TP = 1.2550

===========================================  
  
You can use his predication and use Paulus system   
  
Buy EURUSA 15-17Pips stoploss and 40-45pips profit.  
  
I find that his prediction is about 70%+ accurate which is pretty good and you will make some money.

It was valid, then the high from the londontimefrime was not broken.  
  
I found for me, i will check the actuell trend in m5, so i can filter wrong trades in m1, like yesterday.

Very interesting strategy. I've been looking for a non time consuming short term strategy to complement my position trading. I'll have to give this a try. Being in the US, I'll have to opt for the NY Open though, using the E/U.  
  
I'll also take a look at the Aussie & Tokyo open.  
  
So, Paulus (and others), following the original rules, it sounds like the only discretionary part to this is determining what is or isn't a trend in the time prior to your open. Starting from a completely flat market to the pip. (eg. Euro open to London open) how much of a rise/fall are you using to determine the trend. Is there ever a minimum boundary where you say, "No trend today, I won't take a trade?"  
  
Thanks all.

I did a quick backtest on the E/U using the New York open. Last month trading or 21 trades.  
  
14 losses  
7 wins  
  
1,000 account would end with a 1,350 balance.  
First 8 trades were losses so had an initial drawdown of 40% to 600.  
  
So a 35% increase in 1 month.

Ran Aud/Usd at the opening of Singapore (just not enough movement between Aus and Tokyo)..  
  
9 wins  
12 losses.  
  
Ending balance of 1,750  
  
Guess its time for some forward testing.

Exactly..plus spread  
  
  
  
Just thinking out loud again, as Paulus mentioned, MM is a big key.  
If we could let the winners run with a trailer we might get some big returns.  
  
I have a trade management EA I can slap on a pair. Moves s/l to BE + whatever pips you designate whenever you hit a set pip count.  
  
So I was wondering about moving the s/l to say +13 pips when the trade goes 15 pips in your favor (assuming a 5pip original s/l x 3).  
  
Then from that point the EA can trail conventional or you can set a jumping s/l every so many pips.

Absolutely,  
  
Twas written by Steve Hopwood, so all credit goes to him.  
I've included the manual as there are numerous settings (most you won't need for this strategy). Make sure you demo it until you're comfortable with the settings.

be very careful over the years I have found that having a fixed stop and fixed TP gets max gains the leverage here s the 3;1 RR and MM

I appreciate the thought and of course this is your strategy, just throwing ideas out there.  
  
Do you feel that based on a 3 to 1 fixed TP of 15 pips scenario, that it might be worth the risk of pulling your s/l to 13 pips (and risking the 2 pips) with the potential upside movement?

Hi Paulus   
  
Love your system, very impressive returns, as you have basically doubled your account every month and if you continue with that you will have over £8,000,000 by the end of the first year's trading.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)  
  
Not enough to live on of course but certainly a start in the right direction.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
  
But heres my question about MM on the quote above you say:  
  
_"I still believe that this system will make constant money and I still believe it can be improved on ..2 wins per week would give 60% growth per month without money management I think when you use MM you could double or treble that"_  
  
What do you mean by that? What MM system are you refering to?  
  
Thanks again for a great thread will follow with great interest.  
  
All the best Clive. 

Feel the Fear and do it anyway!!!

60% is indeed great but not double per month unless you are compounding profits to get you there.  
By compounding your profits into each trade, you gain a higher percentage per month. I think this is the MM he is speaking of.

Can you please tell me where you got your tick data from for your back testing. Testing on 1 min tick data means a heap of data when you back test on a few years of info.

yes sorry it is .. 5 % of the compounded bank  
  
Recovery is allot quicker using a fixed financial amount  
ie   
  
If I bet £20per pip and my stop is 10 pips then my TP is 30 pips  
  
I lose £200 or win £600  
  
Do this untill your bank has doubled then bet £40 per pip double again etc etc  
  
That particular MM needs to survive 20 losers like our 5%  
  
So if you had £1000 20 bets would be 20 bets of £50..you stick to £50 risk £150 win until the bank has double then go to £100 etc etc.  
  
the reason the recovery is quicker after losers is because each time after a loss your still betting £50 to loss £150 to win  
  
On my 5% method as you lose money your recovery bet gets smaller because 5% of you bank is smaller  
  
here is an example   
  
**_5% MM Starting with £1000 3 losers 2 wins_**  
  
1000 x 5% = £50  
Results £50 loss  
  
£950 x 5% = £47.50  
Results £47.50 loss  
  
£902.50 x 5% = £45.12   
Results £45.12 loss  
  
£857.38 x 5% = £42.86  
Results win = 15% = £128.60  
  
£985.98 x 5% = £49.29  
Result win = 15% = £147.89  
  
Bank after 3 losers 2 winners = **£1,133.87**  
  
**_Fixed value starting with £1000 3 losers 2wins_**  
  
  
£1000 / 20 losers = £50 risk  
  
1000 x 5% = £50  
Results £50 loss  
  
£950 fixed stake £50  
Results £50 loss  
  
£900 fixed stake £50   
Results £50 loss  
  
£850 fixed stake £50  
Results win = 15% = £150  
  
£1000 fixed stake £50  
Result win = 15% = £150  
  
Bank after 3 losers 2 winners = **£1,150**

I didnt post my Friday win as I was surprised to see others had failed  
  
My entry on my SB account was 1.2630  
My SL to fill was 3 pips x 3 (15%) plus my spread of 2 = 11 pips  
  
I needed 1.2619  
  
The swap went down to 1.2617 but I closed manually not auto when I hit the 15% I got 14% but on other days I have lost 4% not 5% so it tends to level out as my calculations cannot be exact due to the 1min time frame

Paulus,  
  
I have no experience whatsoever with a sb.  
So I was wondering....when you place your trade do you just pick the amount of your account that you want to risk and place and the sb automatically calculates the per pip value based on your risk and SL. Or do you have to calculate out the number of lots etc...  
  
Thanks in advance.

it seems that tighter stops continue to be more profitable; Paulus 72% since thread started, me 38% employing larger stops  
  
although, i havent traded every session and still need a bigger sample to be sure  
  
will run 2 positions simultaneously.........tigher stops and bigger  
  
Paulus, when you post your trades, could you please tell us your stop price?

We need an EA (or is it a script?) that will allow us to key these 3 variables:  
  
Stop price  
Risk %  
Reward %   
  
These 3 variables are easily keyed before the signal. Once the signal arrives, hit **OK**. And an at market order is sent.  
  
The EA uses your account balance, opening price, SL and risk/reward % to calculate the appropriate lot size.

Hi Peter -- Can you confirm that 1.2704 is the correct price to short from ? My platform has that particular bar as showing as light green on my macd and does not go dark green until the next bar even allowing for platform differences my xx.10 bar opens at 1.2705 and closes at 1.2698, that is still 6 points difference to you, quite a lot.  
  
Just confused, can you confirm 1.2704 was the correct price and that all conditions had been met to enter at that time ? I woulden't expect differences in platforms to be that much.  
  
Cheers ............  
  
Great system Paulus by the way and thanks very much for sharing.

There is a script available which does this. Search for 'EASY ORDER'. Allows you to predetermine your risk (%) of account, then drag your SL and TP lines to wherever you want to. Whenever you're ready you just press 'submit' and it calculates the lot size and places the order with your SL and TP.  
  
Check it out.

yup, different on Alpari (UK) too - signal candle at 08:11 (UK) with a low of 1.26968, swing high for stop 1.27057 + 1 pip + spread. 08:19 candle high reached 1.27064, so in theory just missed being stopped out.

I saw this trend in Europe up. The system said buy 1.2705. I wonder what kind of right action?

i've made a mistake there........for short the MACD signal should be light green to dark green  
  
that entry signal came at 712 GMT (after the 711 candle completed) from what i can tell, short at 1.2700

Yes I can see that you can recover quicker from your losses using a fixed lot size,which of course is great when you win but has a downside if you continue to lose as you quite rightly say you would wipe your account out after 20 straight losers.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f62d.png?v=15.1)  
  
I personally prefer to use 5% of the outstanding balance of my account all the time win or lose as this means after 20 losers in a row you would still have 36% of your account left. eg you are still in the game.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)   
  
In fact by using 5% of your outstanding balance for every trade , it is impossible to completely blow your account. You could lose every trade for the rest of your life and still have some money left, be it fairly small but of course one would hope that someone losing every trade might go back to the drawing board before that happened.:nerd:  
  
Of course using 5% still gives you the advantage when you win of the compound growth effect too so your account still grows exponentially. Hence Paulus has managed to double his account 4 times already in less than 3 months. Awesome trading Paulus!!!  
  
So basically the secret to good money management is very,very simple.  
  
Always trade with the same % risk of **__"The Outstanding Balance of Your Account"__**. That way you will never blow your account but at the same time your winners will grow your account at an amazing rate.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f911.png?v=15.1)  
  
Hope that might help anyone struggling to risk 5% per trade.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f630.png?v=15.1)

Feel the Fear and do it anyway!!!

Draw the trendline from European Open to London Open to determine which direction to trade. See Paulus post #6.

My mistake that I did not take into account the new bottom in the London session. So? And now, after that you have to look down?

tol  
  
I think you're settings might be off on your opening times. That's why you're reading an up trend when everyone else is seeing down. It's not the "session bottom" its the direction from eur open to lon open. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

This indi helps me a lot with lot sizing. I've modified it to calculate based on account balance. Just set the risk % and you can calculate based on s/l in pips or at a certain level.  
  
For this strategy set it to your desired level and then it will adjust as market moves to the appropriate lot size.

Hello @ all,  
  
Paulus,  
  
how much trades have you taken until now? I think a little bit more than 50?  
  
  
This is a very nice thread, thx Paulus for sharing this :-)  
  
  
Regards...  
  
Chriss

Make sure your open/close session indicator is drawing lines at the correct time for the european and London open - then draw your trendline between price at those two opening points...sloping downwards this morning.

Tol  
  
The London Open you show on your chart should be 1 hour later likewise with the European Open. However from what I can gather from this system you need to look at the slope of the price from 6am (1hr before the European Open) to 8am (London Open) current UK time.  
  
It would be helpful as there has been so much needless confusion about which times to look at if Paulus would once and for all make it clear that his system looks at the two hours prior to the London Open and has absolutely nothing to do with the Eurpopean Open whatsoever.  
  
So on your chart the start of you line is correct but the end of the line should carry on for another hour.  
  
Also where you say short I make it one peak earlier and you then almost get stopped out on the peak you have chosen.  
  
This system caught my eye as I trade a reasonably similar one that I designed myself.

I watched all of the pages. The answer is no. What GMT time will reveal London. What is the Europe. I looked at Paulus - the entrance to the market as I have. Ordered a certificate is just no time. Answer please.

The European Open line should be at 5am GMT and the London Open line at 7am GMT.

Looks like you're an hour early on your London open on your platform.

Hi Paulus, and Hi every one followowing this thread.   
  
I have followed your thread from the very first day. I only started using it thursday last week because I am very new in the trade and was practicing most of the time. But I am conviced it is a winner.It may not be what proffessionals would be looking for, but for us who are new here, it gives us a stepping stone.I have 2 losses and 1 winner but my acc is 4.3% up.  
  
Thanks Paulus

I set this up this morning on a micro account for trading here in US time zone.  
  
Decided to try E/U and G/U both.  
  
First trade on G/U was triggered 13 minutes after NY open at 1.5652  
S/L was hit at 1.5606 (just barely) If s/l would have been a pip higher trade would have been a win. Oh well.  
  
G/U - L -5%  
  
Watched E/U and it wasn't triggered until 1 hr. 14 minutes at 1.2602. S/L of 1.2610 was almost hit (ironically to within 1 pip) and then turned back down. Brought s/l to +20 pips when trade reached +22. Was almost immediately hit at 1.2582 for a win.  
  
E/U - W +12%  
  
Not quite sure why my win was only 12%. My s/l was 1.2610 (6 pips + 2 for spread). 6x3=18 plus 2 for spread is 20. Don't know if market jumped at last second so my lot size was off. Guess it could have gone the other way. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Hey quick question.  
  
Tough to watch screen every minute even for short time...nature calls, wife needs you, etc.  
  
If any of you miss the first tradeable entry are you just shutting down for the day or do you take the next entry that you see. Either way would be a mechanical system. Just interested to hear how you all think.

Thanks, that helped to understand. For almost 3 years, as I was looking for a similar algorithm. But I looked for 1 hour. Only now, it turned out gather all in one algorithm.

Also I can add if I may trade with the trend ..let the current direction of the market do the work for you  
  
This system is very simple but like all simple things can some times be frustrating and difficult to implement  
  
Find a trend enter on a re-tracement   
If all rules are met and you get a green light - enter the market

Hi  
  
thats good ,more than you make in a year with interest at the bank !  
  
Just follow the rules...Today has been a good start its Monday and we have a win and the followers of the thread has increased  
  
It human nature but if this was the 4th losing day we wouldn't have 1/10th of the followers  
  
If I can just reinforce the facts here ..you will get losers most probably 4 to 5 in a row but by risking 1% to 5% of your account with a risk reward of 1:3 you should win overall.  
  
This is a simple system and requires no trade maintenance one your in .. dont dabble .. dont move your stops ..this is 1min dont forget the time frame with most noise you need the breathing space   
  
You have a hectic minute when the trade sets up then just shut down and do some else you can influence the market no more it goes where it wants

As long as the TP or SL hasnt been hit thats fine .. I would put a limit order in for the actual signal entry that you missed at lest it gives you a chance of re entry.

How to put the risk of 5% in five points? This is the most difficult question - psychological moment. It will be taken, as a rule, but you need a few victories. We put a stop order on the local riding (bottom), which will fall in the histogram MACD? Is that right? And if the stop order will be determined by a small 3-5 points, it is going to take trades it is from such stop order? And put the profit in three times larger. Question, I'm doing right when I accept trades from such stop order?

Hi Spiderman:  
  
I am in North America like you, I work very early morning up at 5AM rushing to work, Basically, I can not play both London time and NY time market at all.  
  
I am low end laborer and I am very new practicing demo near 10 weeks, Sometime, I ask this question,_ Why this System work in London time? Why this system doesn't work other time?  
_  
Tested it with old EA " Sauron 1.4/1.3" and it indicated that During London time, market price is more " Trend" predictable, and also best stop-loss is between 14-17 pip, while profit is 35 to 45 pips.  
  
I might be wrong, I guess that when German market open which is one hour ahead, first few min to 30 min are impulse buyer/daytrader, Then market price back to what is suppose to be "Either" Up and Down trend" base on support and resist level.  
  
When London market open, Those impulse buyer/daytrader look at German market 1 hour price response then impulse buy/sell/trend for awhile, After 30 min, market price will be back to what is suppose to be " Trend" mode base on support and resist level  
  
3 and 4 hours after london market open, Some daytrader profit taking, London banker want to go for dinner/after dinner, Earlybird US buyer, those force come it and Market's price might start to change for different direction. ( not is trend mode).  
  
During NY time, Because both Europe buyer and US buyer, Both forces fight, market price is very un-preditable ( trend) and very volatile, If you are skillfull, you can take that big money.  
  
My point is that, Paulus system might not work that well for other market open.  
  
I saw that someone submit this system to coder "Funyoo", If we are lucky, we might be able to see An " EA" basic on this system, " Funyoo" codes normally has so many option, EX, Trailing profit, breakeven" Etc, lots of things to play with.

You stated that you started with £2.000, after 25 days you have £9.000 and now, two months later you end up with roughly £19.000. This system sure has some stunning results. You'll be a millionaire in no time if all keeps going well. I hope you manage to do so!

Hi Giraia  
  
This is exactly the same as Paulus trade shown earlier on post #583. His was a winner so I assume your stop must of got hit on the next spike up whereas Paulus's obviously didn't.  
  
Either stop placement error on your part or the difference between brokers, maybe your spread is bigger than his? Who knows? Either way it was very unlucky on your part, but thats all part of trading I'm afraid.  
  
This is only my opinion as can't see any other reasons why the same entry failed on one but not the other.  
  
Hope that helps. 

Feel the Fear and do it anyway!!!

the only thing we need to add to this **incredibly simple system** is more forward testing with real money...........does it perform well over an extended period of time???  
  
when the market goes bonkers/ gets volatile, which it does at times, this system will be cut to pieces with small stops  
  
but yes a 950% increase from £2.000 over a 10 or 12 week period is excellent (my bank offers me 5% p.a.)  
  
...........lets see if it can be sustained over time and under varying market conditions

Hi Paulus  
  
Yet another awesome trade today. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)  
  
However, I hope you don't mind me saying, I couldn't help but notice that after your TP, price carried on down another 50 pips before pulling back and dropping a further 50 pips.   
  
Now I know your method is to TP at 3:1 but it seems a shame to miss out on such a good move like todays. Have you any thoughts on trying different exit strategies to maximise returns when price moves so favourably in your direction?   
  
Maybe something like instead of closing at 3:1 use an expert adviser to trail the price by 10 pips until stopped out? Maybe if you started trailing at 2:1 then it might have 2 advantages   
  
1) To avoid some losses all together, when price whips back on you before reaching 3:1 target, and   
  
2) Increase some of your winners like todays could of gotten you another 30 pips practically doubling your profit to 30%.  
  
I suppose the only way to answer the question is to analyse your past winners and see how many, if any,went on further after your TP.  
  
Have you any thoughts on a particular exit method that might maximise returns from the really strong moving winners?  
  
Thanks again for such a great thread, keep up the good work.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Price went above last top for at least 1 pip. So his stop is 2, 3 pips above last top?

Yep he says on one of his earlier posts on page 2 I believe that his stop is a couple of pips above the last high for shorts and below the last low for longs.  
  
But I would say check your spread at time of trade and allow 2 pips plus your brokers spread so in my case with Vantage that would be 2+1.5 spread=3.5 total above high/below low.  
  
If your brokers spread is much higher than 2 pips I would suggest changing. I use Vantage and have found their [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") to be among the best in market plus they don't have a market maker they just trade straight through.  
  
Hope that helps.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

In response to the post attached, Jpr directed me to [this post](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=4420168#post4420168)  
  
Given for this strategy it is the relationship between SL, entry price and account balance that determines lot size, this is a bit of a hassle to calculate when trading the 1M and “at market” prices.  
  
The tool linked above allows you to position your SL price (which we can anticipate before/as our trade signal develops) and send an “at market” order the moment the system's signal is given.   
  
The tool simultaneously calculates your lot size based on risk selected (5%), your SL price as positioned and your account balance, and then opens your trade position for you.  
  
………pretty handy given time is of the essence once the signal completes.

I will in my spare time try to put some of this to code, MT4, VT Trader. I had a good one for GBP/USD 3 years back 5:00 AM Daily pick based on its 4 hour movement co-insiding with EUR/USD, you go with EUR/USD high or low for the day, close or Limit out before rollover. One guy won king for the month with stategy thru [FXCM](/brokers/fxcm "View FXCM Broker Profile"). Myself I couldn't get up that early.. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) I used to say) The Brits set themselves up all night to get cashed out by the Americans at 8:30........................If you can delv-in deap enough you will see it too.

Morning Peter and all. Firstly, thanks to Paulus for bringing this to us and his continued presence and help, first impressions are, well. impressive.  
  
After a few months away from trading I've been looking at this on my return and intend to run it alongside my normal MO. I normally trade from 1min charts so this had some immediate appeal, I have done a fairly strict backtest for the 4 week period to last Friday and the results were in common with what has been quoted, my own sample showed a profit of exactly 100% for the period. Now I know 4 weeks is nothing but I can't ignore what I have seen with my own eyes so most days I'll be trading this.  
  
Peter you are right about trading this with real money, the only way to check it out properly and I've never been one for demo trading (and by the way I have never blown any trading account) so I intend using one of my near redundant SB accounts with a nominal few hundred £'s on balance and will trade this as close to the rules as poss. However rules are for breaking as we all know, so I'll be using a bit of discretion here and there, especially on the SL.  
  
Giraia: I did the trade yesterday and this may help you. I used the previous high to calculate the SL however I never put my actual SL into a trade, I do my SL manually every time and on that occasion price on the charts I actually use for trading showed the SL being topped by 0.6 pip, I was watching very closely but didn't abandon the trade at that point. I would suggest others may have done likewise or they may have used the previous Hi.  
  
All the best to all with Paulus's method. strada.

Today I'm down. How to leave space for divergence? According to the rules of today minus. But somewhere near walks the correct answer. Always, when there is a divergence - there is a problem, as foresee it? Today I received the first" -". But, 1/2 portion of the volume worked 1риск :3 profit, after the divergence was in the work. But now I want to listen to others. And why is there - who's up and who's down?

As I understand it from the original instructions, it was a buy as although the trend between europe and london was down the high was broken shortly after london open making it a buy which was then triggered at 9.03 uk time.

but i wanted to stay faithful on how paulus did it.... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1) i think its a better filter even in my backtests and 8 days of forward test  
  
i placed a trailing stop on all positions. and got stopped out but everything in green.  
  
@tol. i think each currency travels in a relative strength of their own, but correlated up to a certain extent.  
  
diversifying to 4 pairs allows me better survival and win rate. if one hits stoploss, the rest won't.

I think it will be interesting what paulus has to say about todays trade. From what I can see today is a no trade day. I don't see a single entry as per my understanding of the rules.  
  
The 8GMT candle was lower that the 7, which was lower than the 6. We should be looking to go short, right? From then I see no stoch pass from 80 to 50 that might signal a short trade. There is one, but that is after the price went back above the 8 candle open.  
  
Someone please correct me if I'm wrong, this is my first day ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Broker variation will give different entries/results sometimes. Alpari (UK) Spreadbetting platform gave a valid long earlier, which was stopped out.

Hi Sidefx,  
I too read it like Wolfeman. Looking at your posted chart it looks like London open was indeed lower than EU open and therefore we were looking only for shorts?

this was adifficult one and not a situation Id really seen before so I tried to look at the market logically ...I marked the hi and lo and we did take out the hi but there was no long as the macd didnt turn red between A and B  
  
By the time I had a red macd we were and I was looking to long the price was 1.2 pips above the low of the EU session at C ..so how can I take this long .. Im at the bottom of the range of the EU session and so i reverted back to my down line on the EU session and looked for a short  
  
My 1st setup at D was not confirmed as the stoch at the point of the signal was below 50  
  
My entry was at E SL 1 pip above the hi I needed 3 x 5pips and my spread was 4 on my Sb today so I needed 19 pips

Before the short signal came, the range high had been breached, which according to the rules means we were then looking for a long entry...i see Paulus has now covered today's situation...

i see what you have done, but how to turn this into an objective rule for future application  
  
for your system, i'm trying to weed out discretion, hence i saw only a buy as posted earlier

Indeed today it was a tough one. I was looking for a short signal. The price had exceeded the European open by about 0.7 of a pip on my platform before the signal was obtained. I decided to stick to a sell. Due to requotes, I was about 6pips from the SHbefore the order was activated. But I had already calculated my sl to be 13pips (my spread is 3pips). Price came to within 0.4pips of my tp before turning on me.  
  
But there is always tomorrow!!

Yes but the high of the range was broken at 8:06 hence bias change is to long. Read Step 2 Post#6 Page 1

Paulus,  
  
Thanks for the comments on this trade! It was very insightful and helpful to see how you considered the movement of the market and then finally took the trade.  
Thanks.

It sounds like I am misinterpreting the entry rules but I'm not sure...   
  
  
6GMT price opens at 1.26066 (IBFX)  
7GMT price opens at 1.25938  
8GMT price opens at 1.25901  
  
To me this means we are looking to go short- correct? For a long entry we must see a breach of the "euro hour" high of 1.26198. In this case a long could not be considered until after 10GMT. At least that's what I'm seeing.  
  
A couple of people refer to a valid long entry. I can see why they say that; but the "euro hour low" does not determine the bias, rather it is the line between the open and close of the euro time...correct?   
  
The short by paulus then does make sense as the only valid entry was indeed short. I ignored that signal because it was above the London open price and that made me nervous. I now see that I should not have been nervous because we can look for a short in this case all the way up to 1.2698...correct?  
  
If paulus could clarify these points of mine it would really help my understanding of the rules.  
  
As it turned out, I sat out last night and I'm glad I did. Though paulus' trade was a winner, it seems to me he lucked out this time.   
  
Or, should I consider the time proven saying " the more I practice, the luckier I get".   
  
Please don't mistake me as a troll. I'm new to this thread and really want to get it down pat. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

European Open line should be set to 05:00GMT and the London Open line to 07:00GMT. The range high was broken at 07:05/06 GMT which signalled looking for a long setup. London is GMT+1 at the moment.

Hi Paulus  
Thanks for great, easy to grasp system which I have been using for a good few days now, my results so far have been positive but nowhere near the returns you are getting, and now you have really confused the hell out of me. Up till now anyone coming on to the thread with a suggestion that we should maybe look at some market analysis or take into account what the market is telling us has been advised by your goodself to stop over thinking, stop analysing the trade, keep it simple, if lights are green its go, lights are red dont go, just stick to the rules laid out in the thread and all will be well. Now this morning most of us took trade as per the rules and made a loss, no thinking or over analysing, just   
sticking to the rules as you say, then BINGO, all of a sudden you tell us you have a winner because you have used discretion and ignored the rules ,thought about what to do and made a winning trade. Could you tell us how much of your really wonderful positive gains with this method have been made with discretional trades.  
Anyway, no offence meant, as I say, really like this way of trading, at least before today I did![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
Kind Regards

I've adjusted my sessions indi to the correct time now.  
  
Still, I don't see the entry criteria as being met for those long trades today. Could be a broker issue. Could some of you guys that took the longs today post your charts so idiots like me can see your entries?  
  
The first one I see is at 7:34

This is from Alpari (UK) Spreadbetting feed. After the failed buy, there was a failed sell; reached 13% odd and retraced...so if going purely by the rules a -5% day (the sell setup wouldn't have been taken...1 trade per day).

Not correct  
  
The Euro-London high was taken out. At that point you should start looking for a long trade.

I tend to agree, but what we "think" is completely irrelevant to this strategy.  
  
The stats [limited though they are] show that this is a winning strategy overall.  
  
The instant you start to not take deals with a mechanical system because of this or because of that, you mess up the stats and you don't actually know what your strike rate is.  
  
In order to achieve the results, you have to take EVERY deal........

Yes, applying discretion (and experience) will change the traders results. And including them confounds our ability to accurately measure the “systems” profitability. Which defeats the purpose of the thread……….because we are not all measuring the same thing.  
  
To be fair, what Paulus has provided is a foundation. As such, perhaps it’s inevitable that each will need to add their own personality. A system in the true sense is unlikely unless a computer runs this for us.  
  
Nevertheless, it’s a good question that you ask.

hello,  
  
the long that i just did, is it correct as per rules? if in case this fails, ill take a 2nd shot at the next buying signal (unless it breaks the low, then ill take the sell signal). thank you for your interpretation.  
  
and the stoploss in really less than 10 pips???? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61f.png?v=15.1)

Hi Peter,  
I think the whole point is the risk/reward ratio. Apply discretion to the stop and that changes, unless you change your TP.   
Then maybe we can take volatility and ADR into account etc. THe "system then has changed.

Took this buy too.   
  
-5%  
  
In fact it was not -5%, i think it is impossible to use stops in the way Paulos is using. Probably i will try ADR or ATR to have a pre calculated stop.

I placed it 3pips below the low of the 2hr period used to generate the sessions bias; penetration of that low, according to the rules, is a reversal, ie. shorts.

Hi i think i can answer for Peter he put it under the low of the Europe open to Londen open. I also first got a close stop loss but then i see what he did and i close 0.2lots of my position when it was positive and then move my sl lower and take profit away. Time will tell if this works for today

Why the bias of direction is taken from 120 minutes period of time? All we know that it is only 60 minutes between Frankfurt and London open.

I think the entry was incorrect based on Paulus' rules. I believe the stochastic has to be crossing the 50 level when the macd changes to light red. So it would have come on the next one to the right.

Well I'm out but had a tight stop (I think this is a good thing). Good luck to Peter and all who are still in.   
I hope Paulus might pop in and tell us how he got on and if we are setting stops to his method. Also if our entries were actually correct.

Stochastic should be below the 50 for long and above the 50 for short. Not already crossing. If the 50 is breached the trade is not valid.

Paulus posted yesterday that he would be away for a few days and wouldn't be trading. The long signal was correct and if you look at his examples, he sets stops a couple/few pips beyond the nearest swing to entry.

Frankfurt opens at 8 local time.  
London opens at 8 local time.  
  
During summer:  
Frankfurt is GMT+2  
London is GMT+1  
  
  
  
So, it is only 1 hour between opens.

Today I have a+. but I put a stop to the bottom of the today is the day 1.2661. The risk of doing 2%. But he did, as he had planned to see this trade today. And so it happened. I think, if today's buy some more, then the profit will come again!

Hi, I'm new here, but have been trading solely on Gold. I saw this method and thought I'll give it a try, using what I've learnt in Gold trading to apply here.   
  
IMHO, the direction to trade should not be dependent on simply the breaking of the highs or lows between Euro and London open, what's most important is the underlying trend, which to me has been long for few days already, even today. London trade often reposition itself for better trades, ie, today is long, it very often drops lower for a better position to buy, it will most certainly break the lower line. If short trades are taken from breaking of lower limit as in today, I'm afraid next up will be your stoploss. This was the case in yesterday's trade as well. If the trend is up, then believe and stick to it, do not swing your bias up and down. Infact, by breaking the lower line today, it has improved the Risk Reward ratio, much to my welcome.  
  
I made yesterday and today based on this logic, I like this simple method, but I've tweaked the directional assessment and removed the breaking of lines rules, plus mm, I am green these two days.  
  
Just wanted to share and hope its been helpful.

If that's the case today's long trade would not be valid because the 1 hr Euro-London low was breached before the trade signal.  
  
Paulus can you chime in on this? Or anyone!

Regardless of all this confusion between the start times, I believe Paulus has been using the two hours prior to London. So his current results are based on that.

As I've said in the past on this thread this system has nothing to do with European Open time so ignore the Euro Open completely! It uses the 2 hours leading up to the London Open. I wish Paulus would update the rules as a lot of this thread is taken up with people understanding things incorrectly due to misleading rules.

So if direction of trade comes from 120 minutes period of time before London open (not between Frankfurt and London Opens) thats fully clear for me and i dont have any more questions in this matter.

The 2 hour spell prior to London encompasses japan end of day, middle east/russia started and most important mainland europeans (esp Germany/Swiss) at their desks even though primary markets not open but they are trading, and of course London desks filling up from around 7. So less to do with market opening times, more to do with actual activity. The 2 hour spell prior to london open is in this case a valid way to evaluate direction, BUT, london markets opening can change all that. Strada.

Determining trend that then offers a statistical edge is quite difficult to identify - so exactly how have you tweaked the directional assessment?

Hi Sonicboom  
  
Yes I think working out the direction to trade is the most important part of this strategy, then look for a quality entry in that direction, eg if long look for a good support level and watch for a turn signal. Paulus's signal is as good as any at the right level of course.  
  
Paulus has been using the 2hrs previous to London open as his direction but I think you have a very valid point that London very often kicks off in the reverse direction as you say to "position" themselves for entry.  
  
That being the case it would make perfect sense for us to do the same. After all it never hurts to follow the big boys!  
  
Question for you Paulus?   
  
Would you consider an alternative way to finding the trend direction to trade?   
  
Question for you sonicboom?  
  
How would you recommend finding the right direction in the morning?  
  
Hopefully if we all work together we can only improve what is already a very successful strategy.  
  
All the best Clive![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Hi Sidefx and Clivepackham  
  
I personally use the EMA 21 and 16 on H1/H4 (don't ask me about the mathematics, it works and if maths works 100%, we'll all be rich). I look at the high TF Weekly/Daily to visually see the move. If there is a trend, its easy to see it even without anything else but the eyes on these TF. I use these two EMAs on H4 and H1. Keeping it simple, I will not bring up other issues like PA and Supply/Demand zones, I use them to assist in being confident. Once the direction is determined, I now use Paulus' method for entry.  
  
Regarding flowing together with the London market when they are repositioning, I'm not so ready to do that. I would rather wait it out until its moved to that position for an entry in the direction of the trend, as we may not know for sure if the repositioning has enough pips room for profit.

To add further, even after determining the trend from higher TF, _for this strategy_ , I'd follow the H1 trend as highest priority.

Hi Dutchsignals,  
  
In line with the sentiments of Grumbo, which I fully agree, this system was designed by Paulus to be simple. My inputs were to prevent unnecessary losses, which equate to gains.  
  
Its just a simple EMA crossover so no need for a chart, sorry mate.

Any attempt to establish trend in order to trade post-london-market-open using 1 minute charts and with small SL's is a complete waste of time. You will get slaughtered trying to trade off 1 min using high t/f trends etc. May sound good in theory but is meaningless in reality.  
  
Paulus is using a simple method of finding early bias (probably a better description than direction) and combined it with a method and MM that in recent times has given a very good return. If every loss is going to create demand for change then this thread will collapse. By all means look for improvement but don't bring them to the table until there is firm evidence or obvious advantage.   
  
One thing that may be worth considering is price action immediately after a signal. There have been occasions on losing trades when price has not improved at all or by very little. In my own experience (several years trading off 1min charts) I always wait for some improvement in price before taking the trade on, in this instance I'd suggest 1 pip improvement (but calculation for SL and TP remain as per system ie based entirely on closing price of signal bar/candle).  
strada.

Two previous hourly candles define Up Trend.....at start of session.  
  
I wouldn't start to guess the market - trade what you see, not what you think. We can't be right all the time...

You said it.   
  
Are you going to rely on someone else's data and put your money behind it?

so a noob with a whopping 11 posts comes on the thread and calls a highly regarded member and idiot and a moron. Nice.  
  
Take a minute and look at paulus contributions here, then look at your posts and review yours. Lazy ass, wannbe spoonfed comes to mind- why not read the thread?

This is so uncalled for, Paulus did mention that he will be away, and no one owes you any answer just by those words.

Good trade Peter, well done I can see why you entered there but a bit confused as to how you chose your stop level at 1.2669?  
  
Very good SL as it must of come close to stopping out so how did you choose that level?

Clive thanks, yes the trade survived by just 1 pip.  
  
The SL position [is explained here](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5775775#post5775775).  
  
And SL application for me, with this system, is discretionary at present; although I maintain the 1:3 RR rule.

Well stated Wolfeman..  
  
It is sad to see those who want to trade operate in this manner. The inability to control one's emotions will destroy their account.  
  
To **stevewalker..** You should seriously consider another profession. You do not have the temperament for trading at this time.

yes! got an answer.  
  
first ; did not call anyone as "idiot" or "morone". have just used words in post.  
but yes I used those words to get reaction from experienced followers or creator.  
  
second; I had asked a very simple question. if this sysem has BT ed ot not.  
most of manual traders does not want to test their system with past data. they do not want to wake up, and live in the dream until things go wrong.  
  
third; I am not offensive. this sytem is not invented. there many systems uses US open UK open what ever. hope this works well for all of you. nuances important!  
  
fourth; again have you ever back tested it? yes/no // if no I will code it and test it. and if you can be polite I can share it with your lazy part.  
  
walker  
  
PS : this is you not me. "Lazy ass"

I am well experienced coder/programmer. can surly do it.   
but if some one did it before why waste time?  
  
also had shared many self codes for free. in many threads. I am new here.  
  
code is not data. code is code. and I can rely after I see it.

if you are talking about account attched to my profile is a test/demo account to test my mental barrier with 0.2 lot per 200usd initial balance.  
  
second that account achived   
%90 gain   
in 3 days   
with %10 DD   
with fix 8 pip SL   
  
then %90 DD in one day. that is the test.  
  
so you had not blow any demo/live account what a profession!!!  
so why you following a simple market open thread.   
  
walker  
  
PS: account did not blow. still keeps the initial deposit.

Would be great if you can code this. I will surely help in any way i can. I am not a professional like you in terms of MQL coding but i know a thing or two.   
  
I also believe a good backtest is worthwhile.

I believe it would be quicker to do a manual backtest.  
If you only take one trade a day (the first trade after LO), you should easily backtest one year in about 3-4 hours.  
  
To my experience you need about 1 minute to backtest 1 trade / day.  
  
Not said, that I will do this...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1), I like to forward test.

Bias is UP only due to french PMI figures, prior to news the bias was flat or down by less than a pip. I suppose we go with the chart as of 8.00. Looks like the news at 7.58 has already been digested though.

i have a break of "bias zone" low by a mere 1 pip 731GMT, (offsetting buy signal at 733GMT), combined with**not so good news** , plus overall market bias i think is **down** , (although our opinion does not matter with this strategy!)..........so when we can get a short signal, then TP has increased probability i would argue

As far as I can see there hasn't been a valid signal to take a trade yet - bias has also changed to short now and there hasn't been a short signal either. Correct me if i'm wrong.

But wasn't the initial bias a SELL bias???  
Why looking for buy?

Price went up slightly from the two hours before London to the London open hence bias was initially long. When it then broke the low of those two hours it then became short. No signal has yet been fired off in either direction as far as I can tell.

Hi fellow traders,  
  
Not to publish after the fact, I'm still learning this system, but just to share my trade today.  
  
As I've mentioned, my bias is through EMAs 16 and 21. As seen from first diagram , the 16EMA was below 21 EMA, thus giving me the bias as down. It was down 5 hours preceding the London market.   
  
As the bias was down, my signal was received at 0812GMT entry @ 1.2681. My SL was previous high using the 1M chart and I got 1.2693 as shown by the Red line. After 3:1 ratio, my target was 1.2645. The trade went up and I took another position with another short signal. Target was achieved.  
  
I knew there was German figures at that time, but I think we shouldn't let that affect the system. This system works also by the RR, so we must try to trade everyday. As in today's case, I was also lucky Germans were in red.

OK, I misunderstood Paulus.   
For me Europe Open is Frankfurt open, 1 hour before London.  
I won't make any change or suggestion to his method, that works fine.  
  
But I'll check signals based on 1h before London, not 2 hours previuosly.  
Just to make comparison. Today was OK.  
  
Have a nice trading day ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Hi, 0806GMT signal was invalidated by stochastic <50, if I understood the system to be correct.

At the risk of sounding like a stuck record... IGNORE the European Open, its has nothing to do with this system. You use the two hour period before the London Open for direction. European open just happens to be smack bang in the middle of this. I have asked numerous times for Paulus to amend the rules but he still hasn't which just results in confusion for many people and pointless time zone questions

I'll relook , I got mine at 46.89. Just to make sure we are singing the same tune, we look at the Main, not the signal of Stochastic, right? (genuine question)  
  
Well, if I'm wrong, I just missed one position of 3.

Ok, I've expanded that section, look at the vertical red line, that's what my Sto was reading.

Hello Everybody am new here i just saw the thread last night and i have been trading the 1mins chart with my personal method which have been great even till this morning but i wanted to trade Paulus Method and i was in a rush LOL and i drew the line from Euro Open to London Open and gush it was a BUY Signal i took the trade and behold i got a lost trade of -$29 but bet you am gonna make more than that using PAULUS method as i just checked with my personal method and behold it was a sell signal, the lost trade was my MISTAKE.  
  
Below is my how i set my TP on my personal method which i will be using to check the 3:1 of PAULUS METHOD which has been corresponding.  
  
Open a 4hrs chart calculate the last pivot points of the last 4hrs that will give you to exact level the price can go in the next 4hr check and see you will be amazed.  
  
Thanks  
Zawad

Correct. Must be due to broker feed variation. Which do you use?

...what made you select 1.2675 for the SL on this one?...can't see the logic at that level.

OK, thanks. It's not easy to pick out discretionary stop levels on the 1min that are relatively close to current price action and that also give the required edge.

PeterE,  
  
Are you doing the compounding that Paulus does? or just otherwise?  
  
Either way 58% for 25 trading days is a really good return on capital.

My friend, could you please post your trade with entry,exit etc. because following the method i think todays trade was a loss... and so were most of the trades from the past two weeks. Thanks

Would be interested to see what trade Paulus took today if any. Bias was flat to down and the first valid signal would have been a loser unless your stop was more than 1.5 pips. Second trade a winner..  
  
edit: Bias was up for the 2hrs before London open not 1hr as originally posted, revised trade below.

Hey Ozz, I have a question for you. As i see from the chart you posted, you are using the 1-hour window before the London open in order to determine direction you want to trade. But from what i read here, i thought the system uses 2-hour window before London, that is 5am to 7am GMT, am i correct? because that is the window that i use and in that case the direction was UP, not down.

Sorry I have not learnt how to attach these diagrams yet. But for todays trade I got my sell signal at 0713Gmt. my entry price was 1.2679; SL 1.2690 and take profit at 1.2649. Unless I got European and London Open wrong, todays trade was a sure winner if the Sl was not more than 10 pips above entry

Bias down today  
  
Jumping the gun a little, the zone high is also the daily high for me, so I'll be using that as SL 1.2564  
  
Zone low breached, another sign to short, just waiting for the greens

and and and....  
  
  
before we get our itchy hands on the short. i think it's reasonable to wait for a selling signal above the 50 or 38.2 retracement levels ( like 40%) coz we all know that LO most of the time reverses franky's only to move back to the same direction.  
  
just my 2 pips (although im really tempted right now)

Have been looking at some stats for this but only over last 4 weeeks until today, some interesting observations. Take what you will from it but it looks to me that the bias is something we might want to look at, it's a major criteria of the method but is it adding value to the method?? Yes I know only time will tell and all these stats could change dramatically but I don't think we should ignore them.  
  
Results for last 4 weeks to today (all times are GMT):  
using method as laid down ~ W 7; L 13.  
using 6 till 7 to establish bias ~ W7: L 13.  
using 5 till 6 for bias, trading from 6am ~ W 13; L 7.  
NO bias, take first signal buy or sell from 6am ~ W 13; L 7  
NO bias, take first signal buy or sell from 7am ~ W 11; L 9  
  
Some other observations:  
some of the losing trades using the original method went against well established moves with not much other evidence of a reversal.   
Sometimes TP was 1 or 2 pips away from target due to well established resistance lines and turned into losses.   
Several losing trades had price move against trade immediately after signal and never improved.   
London open is always likely to be a lot more volatile than the EU open.   
  
I believe the method and MM are in the main very sound but I do now see a question mark over the "bias" and it's effectiveness.   
  
Does any of this resonate with others?  
  
strada.

Absolutely, to me, bias is everything, the rest is to finetune an entry.

How can bias be everything, we're trading off a 1min chart after the open of one of the world's biggest trading markets, where does the bias from the previous 2 hours fit into that?

Great info Strada, as always perfect logical explanations.  
  
Due to the awful (on going!) confusion here over times (If only the first post had been corrected!!) can you   
  
confirm that:  
  
"using method as laid down ~ W 7; L 13." is the **2 hours before London Open**?  
  
So you are retaining only the Stoch plus Macd colours for entry.  
  
Anything looks better than the laid down bias method!   
Do you have any preferences for an alternative?  
  
I ran a shorter test than you and it too produced a lot fewer wins than losses.

Frankly, its hard not to bring in other considerations and get this complicated again. Within the trend the bias can be anywhere when its handed over to the London market, its not going to be the same most times, in fact, it can be quite random.   
  
Within a trend, the retracement can be quite huge depending on how much and fast the move was before the opening, like today its moved quite a bit very quickly, but I feel that London market is always being efficient, and will travel the distance to position for a better trade. As such, only mm and bigger SL placement will survive the trade. This however does not fit into a simplified strategy here. I won't be surprise in a stop out and subsequent hit of the target for this trade IMHO.

Hi Strada,  
very interesting stats. Especially the results with no bias. It may actually be that the market has not determined its daily bias and the early swings and "fakes" are the process by which it is decided. (order flow).  
  
On forextsd there used to be a guy who claimed to make a lot of money trading that phenomena.  
  
Also of course the markets have been choppy an news driven risk on/off etc.

here's a partial result based on what i have on my record. i also decided to walk the extra mile and check other "opens". i didnt bother with tokyo coz im sleeping by then.  
  
L= SL hit. i placed the average pips that could be made instead of targeting 15%. id rather take home some than let my SL be hit.   
  
if someone can give 1 year's worth of M1 data (June 14, 2012 backwards), pls post it here and i will crunch the numbers during the weekend. actually i can possibly post some before NY opens since the market is ranging.  
  
thanks.

No more backtesting for me Peter, forwards only, will test this from monday on a redundant $ account I still have open but will be using some discretion.   
I'll get back to you in 2 years with my results.

Hi Grumbo, interesting point you make about order flow, think that is major influence on london open.  
  
I've been trading off 1 min charts for several years, normally starting before 7am Uk time and the London opening invariably has an agenda all of its own, if it responds to anything in a meaningful way apart from overnight/early morning news or events it will be from the previous day, US close perhaps. Even the mainland EU activity prior to London open can very often have little impact on London opening but again especially on 1min t/f. Order flow as you've mentioned will also have some impact.  
  
1 min charts generally don't respond or relate to a lot of the parameters of high t/f's, they are a different animal and must be respected accordingly. While a 1 hour chart may be showing strong trend one way a 1min chart could be showing strong trend the other way. That is why the 1 min t/f has to be traded for exactly what we see because that is exactly what is happening this minute, literally.  
  
All the best, strada.

Hi,  
been a reader here since the beginning but didn't post so far  
Haven't traded this method yet but now coded an indy to play with  
And as always, the number of changeable parameters keeps growing to look what happens if you change this or that  
So what we've got:  
RangeStartTime/RangeEndTime:  
\- is your brokers time so you have to adjust to GMT yourself  
InvertBias:  
\- Bias is the difference between StartTime openprice and EndTime openprice ->positive/bullish,negative/bearish bias. This option allows to invert bull/bear.  
InvertSignal:  
\- show buy if rules say sell and vice versa. I implemented this just to see what happens, because gbpusd showed this behaviour several times  
IgnoreBias:  
\- do what the param says. In general you will see a buy signal and a sell signal (which ever comes first) according to the rules.  
  
IgnoreBias or not, if prior to the first valid signal the high or the low is taken out, the new bias will automatically be the direction of the break  
So you shouldn't see a long below the low and a short above the high  
The buy/sell arrow is shown after the candle that fits the rules has closed

**Step 2  
**Using your market open lines draw a line from EUR open to Euro close it hasn’t got to be super accurate it has to give the general bias of the market  
  
In this example the bias is up so we then draw a horizontal line on the low of the Euro session  
  
If this is broken before we get a signal we then look for a short.If its not broken then we continue looking for a long trade  
  
This is shown in Chart A

for a signal to occur stoch must be above/below 50 and macd changing from green->darkgreen or maroon->red  
while we are waiting for a signal to buy (because bias is up) price breaches the low of the 2 hour range. That makes the long bias invalid and changes it to short...so now we have to wait until a short signal

Oxford, England? Nice city, I'm jealous! Go for a curry, they're good in Oxford. Real ale too.

Take what you will from it but it looks to me that the bias is something we might want to look at, it's a major criteria of the method but is it adding value to the method??

Good work Strada. At last! Someone is prepared to do a little WORK on this!!  
  
I have done some testing of my own based on similar thinking - I.E. when London opens, they often reverse things completely OR they often do a fake move before continuing in the prevailing direction. Either way, I personally don't believe that using bias from 6:00am to 8:00am has any benefit on the M1 charts. And my findings seem to back this up.........  
  
Pips are ignored, as measuring pips is irrelevant.  
  
All tests are based on commencing trading at 8:00am UK time.  
  
Test data starts on 11 April 2012, so we have 52 deals - enough, in my opinion, to be statistically significant............  
  
R1, R2 etc refer to risk:reward. So, for example, R1 = 1:1, R3 = 1:3.  
  
All calculations are based on 5% risk per deal.  
  
The first table shows the original Paulus method.  
  
The second one shows the data from just taking the FIRST signal in either direction after London open.  
  
So, which one to trade? It would appear obvious initially, but could you REALLY live with a 30%+ drawdown on your account? Maybe you could when it's just $1000. But could you stomach a 30% drawdown on $500,000? Could you live with 7, 8 or 9 consecutive losses? Could you live with a strike rate well below 40%? These are all questions you must ask yourself - and ask yourself VERY seriously because this strategy gives some HUGE drawdowns!  
  
But hey! Don't take my word for it, test this out for yourself! I won't be posting any more test information as I don't want to take this thread away from Paulus's original method.  
  
Cheers,  
  
GT3RS

And not forgetting guys................  
  
This looks SIGNIFICANTLY different if you risk 2% per deal.  
  
The profit is nowhere near as high [although still very nice], but without the horrific drawdown..................

statisticly, if system poss of having > 3 consecutive loss, IMO better to trade with fix lot. no MM.

First off, thank you Paulus and everyone for contributing to what looks like a promising strategy. I have been following this thread since the beginning and this week I decided to code an EA for it. I have added several parameters to give some flexibility in how it trades and I allow for trading all 5 session opens. Here are descriptions for the parameters:  
  
// MT4 Server time of each session open (defaults are for EST)  
Sydney  
Tokyo  
Euro  
London  
NewYork  
  
// Which session to trade (use 1 to trade session, otherwise 0)  
// I used int instead of bool so that the parameters can be changed when  
// testing the EA using the strategy tester  
TradeSydney  
TradeTokyo  
TradeEuro  
TradeLondon  
TradeNewYork  
  
MaxSpread // maximum spread to open an order  
UseMoneyManagement // automatically set lot size based on MM if true  
RiskPercent // percent to risk on a trade  
FixedLotSize // lot size to use if MM is off  
Magic // magic number  
Slippage // maximum slippage allowed for trades  
MinTrendPips // minimum number of pips required to be considered a bias/trend before session open  
MinStopLoss // Minimum stop loss allowed in pips  
MinMacdRetrace // When MACD retraces, this is the minimum size of the bar at the signal  
ReverseStochBars // if greater than 0, look back the number of bars for the stoch to be above 80 for buy signal or below 20 for sell signal  
HoursForTrade // number of hours to look for trade after session open  
HoursForTrend // number of hours back from session open to determine bias / trend  
PipsBeyondPivot // number of pips to add/subract from latest high/low for stop loss  
TradeReverseDir // whether to trade in reverse direction of bias of price goes below / above low/high of bias area  
MoveStopLoss // whether to move the stop loss to break even + spread once the reward goes to 2x  
  
It still needs some more testing but feel free to try it out. Any feedback will be appreciated. I'm still a noob so I may have missed a few things.

the hell side of coding EA s. should be coded for different brokers.  
  
Kuma  
  
well done  
  
but you should check stop and limit levels with   
following   
  
if EA send values smaller then that EA should set broker min values  
  
MarketInfo(Symbol(),MODE_STOPLEVEL)  
  
walker  
  
PS: if you send mql I can fix the issues.  
better then to code all.

First, thanks for sharing.  
  
But why 8 gmt and not 7 (London open)?  
  
And in your backtest, did you consider 2 pips spread?

8am UK time, as per the rules., which is currently 8am British Summer Time (BST). I never mentioned GMT.   
  
London open is always 8am local time. Which is currently 8am BST.   
  
For everyone who is unable to work it out (god only knows how you expect to be successful in this business if you can't understand it), it is 8am UK TIME.   
  
Stops were 1 pip from high/low, plus spread.

strada, Paulus' signals are signals in relation to bias  
  
what constitutes a signal for you, without bias?

Hi iwjw,  
  
i'm still trying to learn paulus method.  
  
how did you manage to catch the short at 7:15?  
the mcad was so tiny can't even see on my chart, and if i'm not mistaken, the stoch is below the 50 level?  
i thought we should short when the stoch is below 80 but above 50?  
any comment is appreciated. thanks.

I got confused regading 1 minute 1 trade.  
  
1\. Is that from Europe open to London open?  
why people get th signal early? I just get it less than 1 hour ago.  
  
2\. shall be one day one trade?  
Some people got two different direction trades. Why?  
  
kindly ask somebody to explain.

I'm using my indicator, so I don't care whether it's tiny or not  
At the close of the 7:14 candle stoch was about 52 and macd had a darkgreen candle  
  
The short wouldn't have reached TP so far, but I think I would closes it as soon as macd gets positive values

1)don't care about the names  
the method is using a 2 hour timewindow that's currently starting at 5 GMT and ends at 7 GMT  
2)how would the system work if the trend during the 2 hours is ignored and you take the first trade signal. And without bias there would have been a long signal (that failed) 10 min prior to the short.  
So don't get confused it's only a looking at "what if"

In find this thread to be very interesting.  
  
It appears that mathematically this system cannot fail, considering it contains a 3:1 Reward to Risk ratio. The systems that seem to struggle carry a 1:1 RRR. Thanks for sharing your results, very inspiring!

Hi Kuma,  
  
Many thanks for sharing the EA! I have been following this thread and doing my own testing for a while and it is nice to have an EA to do more testing before going live.  
  
I have changed the settings for the SL to 5%, however, would you mind explaining where the TP/Reward can be adjusted?

Just wanted to say thanks for the Indy. I have just noticed that the Indy issued the sell signal at the same time as I manually entered the trade today (I had the indy on a different chart). So it looks very promising.

I've played around a lot with the size and position of the time window  
As far as I'm concerned, there is no best setting  
The only thing I can imagine is to use the transition from low liquidity to high liquidity. And that would be before LON open and maybe before NY open 10-12 GMT

I have added a parameter called TakeProfitMultiplier with a default setting of 3.

Many thanks! I have tried to run a backtest but I am getting zero results. Have you backtested it yourself? I have adjusted the broker time but left the remaining settings as they are for now.

I have done some back testing on [OANDA](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile") and MB and they both get results. What broker are you using? Do you get any error messages in the Experts or Journal tab? Do you also get the happy face next to the EA on the chart? Make sure you put it on the 1M chart.

I am based in Germany and am using a Flatex account (Demo at the moment). I have attached a screenshot of the Journal tab. Yes, I have the happy face on the chart but no trades were open automatically when I had it running earlier. Did you get better results in the London or the NY session?

when looking at the macd for a change open your data window and look at the actual figures the macd posts  
  
Even if it is a signal because of a 0.01 point of a move an EA will pick this up  
  
I had a signals at 08.14am at 1.2505  
  
My High of last swing was set at 1.2512  
  
My TP required for this trade was 2512 - 1505 = 7 pips x 3 = 21 pips  
  
Add on my 1 pip above Hi of last swing add on my spread in this case I got 3 pips   
  
Therefore 21 + 1+3 = 25pips which I got some 3 hours later

According to your rules on page 1 this would not have been a trade signal as the Macd was red when the stoch was over 80.   
At the point where the stoch was over 80 the macd should have been green then dark green for it it to be a signal.   
Have these rules changed?  
The first short signal post London open was at 9.03 which would have been a loss unless using Peter's preference for SL.  
Can you please clarify, thanks.

We now need the MACD to go red this is going to help us find the best retracement  
Within the period the MACD is red we need the Stochastic to be below 20"  
  
It would therefore follow that the same rules apply for a short signal but with colours green and dark green when stoch over 80.

I’ve been seeing a lot of thought about the bias. What is the consensus on that?  
It would be nice to think I wouldn’t have to get up at 1AM EST anymore. But then again, it would always be an advantage to trade during high volume trading times.  
  
Thanks,

Look Im not the guy who knows every thing here.. read post 1 again it does say this is only 25 days old..  
  
I genuinely am not trying to fool any one here  
  
I saw the stoch go over 80 I waited for the macd to go dark green the next bar it went light green and my stoch was above 50 I took the trade and will do so again if it presents itself  
  
Sorry for sounding jangly but that was the thought process in my head..  
  
This isn't a commercial forum Im not trying make any thing out of this system or any potential EA you guys do what you want with it..Ive not told people or traders here they cannot post 5min charts charts with different indicators on ...its about evolution we share we learn simple as that  
  
But I do feel sometimes that one slip and its good night vienna..  
  
But you said this you said that...the system is a guide thats all  
  
It was a minor minor breach that I honestly did not realise  
  
I really did not make the mental connection with the macd and Im sorry you lost your trade I really am..but you sound bitter about it I won you lost...its not about that.....Im trying to help every one who wants to read...  
  
Please trade with paper and pencil or trade small ...........I say that to every one here and I did not intentionally mislead any one to any thing

I resolved the issues with the EA on your broker so you can give it a try. I need to find some good quality data for doing better back testing as my data quality is only showing 25%.

Don't you worry about your data:  
  
<http://articles.mql4.com/93>  
  
"Reasoning from the same formula, the one-minute data modelled cannot be of quality exceeding 25% since data of a smaller period are not used for modelling of these data. For client terminal, there are simply no data of a smaller period, but there are tick data. However, tick data are not stored in the client terminal by standard means"

about data quality and backtesting... (MT4)  
You need at leat 99% modeling quality! to backtest a 1-min. system!  
so you have to use tickdata!  
  
just my 2cents..

I think that Paulus had a winner today with a long around 7:54  
the reason is that the short signal was only about 5 pips below the upper boundary with a vague bias  
Same thing as a few days back where he didn't take a long near the lower boundary but the next short that also turned into a winner

I am not always at my computer to enter the trade during the London session so I have been testing this strategy during the NY Session.  
  
I am using the original rules. The bias is determined from London Open to NY Open. I add the maximum spread of 1.7 pips plus/minus 1pip above/below last swing high/low as a stop loss. I have manually tested the last 10 days so far. Some of these trades were placed live on a Demo account. I am using EUR1,000 as a test starting balance.   
  
The time below is my local time. I am based in Germany. NY opens at 15.00, according to my local time.  
  
My results are as follows:  
  
  
**EURUSD, NY Session**  
**DateTimeProfit/LossAccount Balance**  

**Starting Balance: €1,000.00**  
12/06/1215.33-5.00%€950.00  
13/06/1215.16-5.00%€902.50

25/06/1215.0715.00%€1,556.35  
  
Just wanted to say thanks to Paulus for posting this strategy! I am planning to go live next week.

Today, Europe was looking a 1 PIP down. I was looking for where to sell. I remember last week. And this trade will again according to all the rules! I specifically left their settings. Here is the answer, why I don't sell before.

Yes, it's really easy picking the winners............................especially after the event and you've thrown the rules out the window.   
  
The indicators and MM of this method have shown their potential, we don't need to curve-fit trades to embellish the performance.

even EA's are fine tuned to current conditions because the markets change as well.  
  
matter of fact: in august, sept and november 2011, whatever bias started at at 3:00 GMT+3 carried on til 18:30, 11/22 business days  
  
then something happened in oct, dec 2011 and jan, feb 2012. there's always a reversal from london open to NY open 17/22 business days. making 17 days a loser. sometimes having a streak of 11 days.  
  
most of the time, they are losers coz the SL was hit although the PA resumed original bias by NY. the system needs fine tuning/ curve fitting, whatever you call it.

Yes. I have already thought about it. He will help and wrong, of premature entry into the market. This setting is simple. No need to enter the market on 1 or 2. Only after 3. And one needs to follow all the other rules of the system. I hope now% plus of the trades will be more stable.

I think the mechanical rules are only giving a heads-up where to open a trade. whether you take it or not is the discretionary part

I showed you my settings that would answer why it is here today I started trading. Here just add Simofor and view history - search trades by the rules. You can determine the ABC. I'm using this still is a very short period. I'll look at the statistics and tell me the result. Indicators all I got in this factory, my picture to show all the names. OK!

Ok, I have manually re-tested. The results are as follows:  
  
**EURUSD, NY Session  
DateTimeProfit/LossAccount Balance  
Starting Balance:€1,000.00**  
12/06/1214.1115.00%€1,150.00  
13/06/1214.1915.00%€1,322.50  
14/06/1214.1615.00%€1,520.88  
15/06/1214.34-5.00%€1,444.83  
18/06/1215.1315.00%€1,661.56  
19/06/1214.07-5.00%€1,578.48  
20/06/1214.12-5.00%€1,499.55  
21/06/1214.3815.00%€1,724.49  
22/06/1214.18-5.00%€1,638.26  
25/06/1214.04-5.00%€1,556.35  
  
The final balance is the same as in the previous test, however, there is often a profit when there was a loss in the last test and vice versa.   
  
I have also noticed that the winning trades could have reached over 15% in profit but some of these winning trades were almost stopped out in the very beginning and were only saved by the extra pips added due to the maximum spread (I add 1.7 for spread, however, it is only about 1.3-1.5 most of the time). I will be adding 2 pips for spread going forward and will make a note of the maximum profit reached.

ok  
I'm getting the same entries with my indicator except 06/15 where at your signal time stoch was 50.0 here and the short that I got after yours (12:44 GMT) was a winner  
But overall I'm not getting the system profitable over a few months period  
Maybe I'm still doing something wrong  
working on it....

Interesting. Perhaps using 2 hours prior to NY open as bias would help? I have not done any more backtesting yet. I am trying to get the EA to work to do more backtesting at the moment. Will post the results as soon as I have them.

Hi Kuma,  
  
I am still working on backtesting. For some reason I get a loss and the trades from the journal do not match my records (I think it must be due the settings), however, I had the EA switched on on EUR JPY this morning and it automatically executed two trades, one loss and one profit. I have manually tested these and it looks like the two executed trades are in accordance with the settings (rules) which is great!  
  
I have attached a screenshot to show the two trades. The Long trade was executed at 9.58 (I know this is not according to the rules since London opens at 9 a.m. Frankfurt time, however, the application was only launched around 9.45 so this was the first long trade after it was launched). I then changed the settings on the EA for London Open to 10 a.m. (just to test if the EA is working) and a short trade was executed at 10.18 (it was short this time because the bias was calculated from 8 to 10 a.m. Frankfurt time). Looks very promising! Will report once my backtest is successful. Where can I check the quality of the data?  
  
By the way, I did not see these trades in the Open Trades window. I only realised that there were two new trades in the Account History later on.

I have saved the Settings from the launched EA and loaded them in the Expert Properties. The results of the backtest are very profitable! Will test different sessions separately and will post the results once done.  
  
Thanks again for the EA, Kuma!

I'm doing my tests for this system with SIG ([Liteforex](/brokers/liteforex "View LiteForex Broker Profile"))  
btw. with the suggested NY session trade we would have had a short at 12:56 GMT that got stopped out  
but the priceaction before (consolidation over a longer period) was screaming not to take that short

Yes, I agree. I took that trade on a Demo account and it was a loss. By the way, did you see "almost a trade" at 14.05 (German) time? I was very tempted to take it but the MACD did not turn dark green. It would have been a winner! Paulus took a similar trade a few days ago which was discussed here and his was also a winner.

yep  
but green changed to maroon and that's why my indi didn't show it  
maybe one could widen the rules a little bit, because maroon is in the right direction (so skipping darkgreen)  
but just saw that stoch was way below 50 on that maroon bar

waiting for a double top to form or for price to reach the upper part of the down trend TL in M5, then will short once M1 signals short. looks like PA is the best filter for the signals.

Hi Paulus,  
  
why did you take the middle of the LO candle for bias and not the open?

I asked why such an inclination? If you look at the candle opening of Europe and London, then take the downward slope! Then the slope of the trend take approximately on the market?

Because it produced a winning trade for record purposes!!!   
Third time in last 6 trading days results have been manipulated, now getting beyond a joke, daily results quoted have no credibility.   
  
From page 1, paulus' own rules which clearly show bias down on his own chart-  
  
"Step 2  
  
Using your market open lines draw a line from EUR open to Euro close it hasn’t got to be super accurate it has to give the general bias of the market"

I dont know what planet your on..   
  
traders like you make me sick manipulating the signals...please have a day off  
  
Seems traders or so called traders here seem to want to pick my bones in minute detail...here is the line drawn again for your benefit Strada...oh 197 post on other peoples threads none statred you..cant take the critism...got no ideas ..to scared or insecure to post your self in front of the mob...Im not out to help people like you ..you want the holy grail of off other peoples backs   
  
From page 1   
  
_Using your market open lines draw a line from EUR open to Euro close it hasn’t got to be super accurate it has to give the general bias of the market_  
  
  
And for your info the EU open and London open times have been the same since the threads started in fact 5 weeks before the thread started..Im not interested in your arguments about what time EU actually open my lines have been consistant  
  
1at candle open to last candle close  
  
Which I take as the open of the 1st candle after the EU line  
And the close as the close of the last candle before the London open line   
  
Hmmm its going up  
  
Ok lets draw close of candle on the EU open dotted line to the close of the candle on the open london dotted line  
  
Hmmm its going up  
  
Im drawing lines _**on what I see**_ you may not have the same opening times as me due to time differences why dont you check that out 1st before you decide to slag a trader that has given shite loads back to this forum  
  
I really take offense to you views on me personally  
  
Your not on ignore strada .. I want to hear your views Im sure you will compose a long convoluted reply carefully thought out and written..oh you want to see my spread betting accounts my account number and my own personal bank statements..perhaps a brief run down on my family history or ...am I really a 49 year old guy who placed his 1st trade in the car park of the registration office of his baby daughter who is now 14 years old....or am In reality a scammer waiting to entice all the lost souls into my web of decit and manipulation.

You have not drawn your line from the "EUR open to Euro close" as per your very simple rules.   
This may be a lack of understanding of your own rules but a line drawn from EU open ie the OPEN of the 6am (5am GMT) to the EU close ie the CLOSE of the 7.59 (6.59 GMT) bar will clearly show a bias to the downside, which is what most people on here had this morning.  
  
The rest of your post I can afford to ignore, your reaction is wholly predictable in these circumstances.   
  
Once again I will thank you for bringing this combination of indicators and MM to the forum, I will certainly be using them, but obviously not in the same way you use them as I'll be trading live.

Paulus,  
I have no axe to grind here as I really like this way of trading having started out as an easy to understand stategy things seem to have got a little muddled. If you take todays open of euro session to todays close of euro session bias was down. If you take todays open of euro session to open of london bias was down, now you tell us you took close of open candle of euro sesssion to close of last candle euro session to give a long bias. It would seem that most people following this thread took the bias this morning to be short just about, so its no wonder we are just trying to get some clarification as to which candle we go from to which candle we go to, pehaps you could just say what that is and we will all be happy bunnies![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

\--------------------  
  
It makes no sense to say: draw a line from the EUR OPEN as the rule.... but NOW to tell us that HIS DEFINITION of the EUR OPEN is the actually open of the 2nd bar after the open as the OPEN.   
  
Here's WHY it's so obviously flawed.  
  
Let's suppose that we were trading 1 hour charts instead of 1 minute.  
  
If someone told you to trade the EUR OPEN then NO ONE would consider the open of the 2nd 1 hour bar to be the EUR OPEN.  
  
Now if the rules had of said: Trade the OPEN of the 2nd one minute bar after the OPEN, then everything would kosher.  
  
...But that's not what the rules say.  
  
Therein lies the bulk of the frustration from what I can see.

OK Paulus, I've double checked what you said in your last post and I concede that you have been consistent in that you have been using the close of the 6am bar/candle as your starting point. On that basis I was wrong to question your trade today. For that I apologise.  
  
The issue of where the bias line should be drawn will no doubt be discussed further with others now.  
  
The issue of the other 2 trades I questioned is something you may want to reconsider. On those days if trades had been taken according to the rules they would have been quite different from the results you quoted. You decided to use some discretion and entered different trades not in accordance with the rules. Don't you think it would be better in the interests of accuracy, fairness and transparency to show results only for those trades that were generated by the method according to the rules. We all know the results will still be impressive.   
Anyway, obviously it's up to you, your thread. I'll save you the trouble of putting me on "ignore", I've had my say, time for me to shut up, I'll stay out of the room now and wish you all good trading with this very good set of tools.  
Strada.

you might like to create your own definition of bias  
  
**my definition of bias:**  
1 min open at 500GMT, plus/minus 1 min open at 700GMT  
and i want the difference to be >=5 pips  
  
alternatively, you could just use Paulus' definition of bias.........his results are better than mine ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

This ea is for educational and analysis purposes only ...  
  
I like this system. Last weekend I wrote this EA. It is a work in progress. It started off as fully customizable (including indicator values) but i have trimmed down the cutomizable variables to a manageable number.   
  
The rule about doing a counter bias trade is not quite right (it is very close). The time values are all chart time (for ease of understanding). The default times work pretty well with a US East coast server.  
  
  
Mark  
  
Ps.  
  
  
_To install and run the EA ..._  
  
1\. Copy the ea to the _Installdirectory_ \experts folder of your MT4 installation  
  
2\. Restart Mt4  
  
3\. Ctrl-o should open the options window (or use tools -> options  
a. Check everything EXCEPT "Ask for Manual Confirmation"  
b. Click OK button  
  
4\. If you do not have the Navigator showing use Ctrl-N to open it.  
  
5\. Open a 1 minute chart that you will attach this EA to.  
  
6\. Expand Expert Advisors node  
  
7\. Double click on the EA (Marks1Min1TradeEA_v2)  
  
8\. Clicking OK button will load to the chart. A successful load will place a little smiley face in top right hand corner. A frowny face means the EA is attached but not running.  
  
  
_EA Settings_  
**ALL TIME SETTINGS ARE THE TIME LISTED ON THE CHART**  
  
Make Trade = true Allows the EA to make trades (a secondary off switch)  
  
zoneStartHour = the chart hour in which to begin calculating the Bias (set to Europe OPEN)  
  
oneStopHour = the chart hour in which to end calculating the Bias (set to London OPEN)  
  
useTradingTime = true enables trading only during hours listed  
  
StartTradingHour = the chart hour to begin looking for trading oportunities (set to London OPEN)  
  
StopTradingHour = the chart hour to stop looking for trading oportunities (set to London Close)  
  
AllowedNumberOfTrades = 1 the number of trades allowed in the Trading Session set above (set to 1)  
  
UseCounterBiasTrading = true When set to true uses the break of the Bias Session high and low to look for trades in the opposite direction *This rule is not 100 % and i am still trying to flush out some of the rules. There are a couple more exceptions I need to code into this  
  
StopLossMinimum = the number of Full Pips to use as a minimum StopLoss default set to 15 pips  
  
StopLossBuffer = the number of Full Pips to add to the StopLoss - used to help cover spread and tweak StopLoss default is set to 5  
  
BrokerUsesFractionalPips = true Set to true if your broker uses fractional pips. i.e. the Eur/Usd is 5 digits after the decimal 1.37624  
  
Lots = 0.01 the base size of the lot used if not wanting to use Money Management feature  
  
AutoMoneyManagement = true Set to true to use the money management feature  
  
RiskBasedOnStopLoss = true Sets the number of lots based on the StopLoss value, the value of the currency and the tradable amount in your account.  
  
PercentToRisk = 5.0 uses 5% of total tradable amount in account to calaculate trade size.  
  
AllowedSlippage = 3 the value of acceptable slippage. this is sent with the trade order and if Broker quote is outside of this setting the broker will not place the order.

I took my short this morning based on the rules on page one defining the bias and entry criteria. I was not the only one. It stopped out for a loss. No big deal. Then tonight I come back and read the proclamation by Paulus that his bias was up.......thankfully there was an outcry of "FOUL !!!" A heated debate ensued and then everybody tried to kiss and make up. I just smile and shake my head. So much BS. A potentially good mechanical system ruined by 20/20 hindsight. I'll continue to watch, but it might be just for entertainment value. Designate me as "disappointed".

Eat the chicken, spit the bones, its all up to individual readers.   
  
Too many trying to measure with micrometer, draw with chalk and cut with an axe, they soon forget the spirit of the design of this strategy, simplicity.  
  
I like this strategy, its taught me many things, but I also come with prior knowledge, so I combine and achieve the target, if I miss it, its only myself to blame. It takes a lot of energy to start and share in forums, I give credit to Paulus here, and for having to put up with these BS by pushovers who's better off absent.

Zawad, I'm using this and it works fine for me. Copy mq4 files into the script folder, and dll into the library folder within the expert folder of your broker file. To open, put the EasyOrder only into the chart and everything else is self explanatory. Hope it works for you.

short at 07:22 GMT stopped out  
even if we could argue about the bias (which was clear down today) the break of the low would have set it to short anyway  
Maybe if there isn't a clear high before the short signal just don't take the trade

For me today down ABC. And I used to 1/4 order to close after 10 pips. So that loss still did not come. (well, at least until I was close to a sequence, as Paulus)

How many times do you have to ask the same question??? And how many times do we have to keep answering it for you??? - I replied to this as did many other back in post 813 on page 55 just 2 posts after you asked it for the second time. Try reading following posts after asking a question.

Hi.. if i may give my humble input with all due respect to the OP and others.. i would recommend to extend the bias time. go quart or half an hour post London open... post london open is where the show starts for eu, during franky move are not as reliable.. post london open is where pa direction gets set if it intends to move that day.. so your either stay safe with no trade or get in on the real direction.  
..or on second recommendation, to use some sort of a STRENGTH measurement (other than what your currently using) for the original bias period to only take the clearly visible strong swings signals.  
for eg., todays downward move in bias period from top to bottom is only 15 pips, that's just not enough of a momentum move to account for a possible direction or follow up.. if for example it was a 25 pips or so then with good look at the londi open, would probably give a better insight.. (this was just a quick observation from a live situation)  
  
anyways, with this two or one or other your odds of success in my humble opinion will increase.  
  
trade well everyone.  
Dean

I had the same problem using a different strat. but it begs the question can any strategy be totally non discretional. Is that not why EA's rarely work (without unacceptable drawdowns/stop loss).  
  
Like many systems if the trend or bias is strongly in the direction of your trade and you have a good r/r then this will be more reliable. Even the we might expect a bounce off PP.  
  
Just my ramblings.

OK, so here is a little indicator I wrote this morning which takes care of drawing the lines every morning.  
  
Please set the PreSessionOpenTime and PreSessionCloseTime to the Frankfurt/EURO and London session times of your time zones. This can also be used for other sessions.  
  
It should reset 1 second after PreSessionCloseTime, if it doesn't just switch timeframes or reload the indicator.  
  
Obviously I didn't do a lot of testing yet, but this looks pretty good. I am going to extend this indicator, currently I am including the Daily Range indicator so you can see targets for your orders.  
  
Ideas/inspirations are welcome!

OK, I didn't see that one, thanks for pointing me to it.  
  
But, I'm trying to go somewhere else with my indi, I find it easier to weave my own code instead of working myself through somebody else's code.

@ iwjw  
Did you take the trade at 14.00? I know your indi did not show it as a signal but from my limited experience an early signal (once the market opens) is very strong even if Stochastic was over 80 before the Session opened (can we adjust the indi?) so I went for it (on Demo). I am at 5% profit at the moment.

i really think no indicator can make this a success except PA.  
  
PA today: after finding clear double tops and a clear rejection of 1.2500, entered and exited accordingly. today = +15%.   
  
forward testing: 4 losses and 7 wins

according to my chart both conditions didn't fit the rules  
close of 14:00 candle had stoch below 50 and darkgreen macd followed be 2 more darkgreen bars (previous green bar was before 14:00)  
I think that adjustable indi would lead to a different trading method. Once you allow to diverge from the rules it's getting something completly different

I say thanks to the Creator of this topic. I thought a lot and finish the work that will help me. Now I continue to test some time with the risk of 2%. Thank you all. I think that the last few days have given all the answers. Now the questions should not be! Time to work. Good luck!

Some contributors to this thread continue to baffle me.  
  
Paulus has posted incredible live forward testing results.  
  
And people are still saying it needs to be changed or tweaked or it's not working. What?  
  
In honesty I hope that the system goes through another run of 4-5 straight losses. Why? Because then all the people looking for the holy grail can jump to another thread.  
  
This thread is awesome in teaching two fundamental lessons: The need for good R:R, and the need to not over-trade.  
  
Thank you Paulus for all your input and your incredible patience.

Look at Peter Es posts as well. Live with SL and TP.   
  
So if SOMEONE ELSE posts live results FOR YOU then all doubt will be removed FOR YOU??  
  
The only way you will remove all doubt is if you TEST IT YOURSELF.

Paulus has an up bias for the 26th of June.  
  
however if you draw the line from the open of his chart at 8.00 GMT his line should start higher (not at the bottom of the candle)  
continue to the end of 9.59 GMT should be lower at the close of that candle.  
  
for those 2 hours should be a down bias or neutral  
  
unless Paulus has a different way of viewing the 2 hour period, like if price was mainly above the line during that period, we go long.

sorry guys........I see that Paulus always uses the close of the 8.00 and 10.00 GMT candles, so bias is up!

Hi! am confusing about timing,   
  
8.00 AM GMT and 10.00 AM GMT  
  
according to this web page [http://forex.timezoneconverter.com/?...=GMT&refresh=5](http://forex.timezoneconverter.com/?timezone=GMT&refresh=5)  
  
is that 1 Hour after London Opens (8.00 AM GMT)

Hi Kuma  
  
I've been giving your EA a run and had a short trade opened 22 mins (27 June) after London open @ price of 1.2491 (SL 1.2493 shown in comments). All this looked correct to me, but I'm no expert. However, the price went against the trade and should have been stopped out, but wasn't and is still open.  
  
Cheers  
  
Paul

agree with lillelise. a signature of a successful system is if **the results can be successfully replicated** not by a few but **by many independent testers.  
  
**paulus himself acknowledged that this is a work in progress. and we are all here out of our own accord to independently verify the results and hopefully incorporate what he has to offer to our trading styles.  
**  
to blindly follow anything, is recipe for disaster** in whatever career one has chosen. successful persons in their chosen professions are not mere followers, they are leaders of their own. and another shared characteristic of successful persons is not really creating something out of nothing. but **re-creating,** building from the efforts of their predecessors, **working smarter not harder.**

Paulus` charts are from TradingPoint, which is a GMT broker, so his 2 hour period is from 9.00-11.00 London time.

I start looking for a trade at 8am uk time..the time here is now 06.59am   
  
I run 2 systems totaling 10 charts  
  
I very rarely chat in the day as if Im not in a trade or a trade is not setting up then I leave the PC .. simple as that  
  
All the info for the system is within the thread and we can all make up our own minds on bias you have seen how I do it and the rules I follow  
  
You need a structure to your life I used to be co moderator of a trading forum and it tied me to the PC for around 12 hours a day...not any more  
  
Yest was a loss ..will update figures later

Hi, the confusion is not when markets open, but when Paulus use to determinate Bias.   
  
As I understood in his first graphics, Bias is 2 hours before London Open TO London Opens. (look char A in the first page.)  
  
He said Frankfurt (germany) Euro Opens To London Open, but in betwee there is only 1 hour and not 2 hours.  
  
This is the confusion i think, most people is having with the Bias.  
  
But now i dont know is when London Open and 2 hours after London Opens. GMT 7-9 Am  
London time 9-11 Am

So according to this.   
  
Bias is forming 2 hours before London to London Opens.   
  
Hopes this is correct.

Hi all and Thanks Paulus for your system  
  
For those looking for accurate market timings, attached indicator may help, I found it on the net, it calculate the timing to GMT/Broker according to your computer clock. It still have an option "Broker to GMT" but if you computer is connected to Net it calculates automatically.  
  
Hope it helps ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

I had a similar issue yesterday. I had the EA running on EURJPY and EURUSD at the same time. The EUR USD trade was executed and stopped out, as per the settings, however, my entry on EUR JPY was still open and when I checked the details there were no SL and TP set for that trade. This was on a Demo account.

I'll be looking at the M1 200 SMA  
At the low of the day we were about 90 pips below the ma and that's pretty much for M1. If price is rejected at 200 I'll be looking for a short with stoch and macd

the strategy is to blindly take the first trade no matter what price did before?  
Today the entry signal came very late and it was obvious that the short at 09:57 wouldn't survive

looks like the only reason for the spike was to kill all the shorties who got in at the 200

1-2-3 swing with fib extension, stopped exactly at FE200  
opened at FE61 break and exited at FE 161 for 26 pips,  
have to admit, little to do with original system...

Three trades? You do not take just the first trade after London opens? Would you mind posting an example of your filter on M5 for today's trades?

No, i trade when i sit on my pc and see a trade opportunity.  
  
i trade on real, and i feel me better when i can check it a time frame higher. also i look some times stoch on h1  
  
there 2 trades from today which i have taken.  
sure, you can other trades also, but we have not a christalglass and with stoch m5 i can reduce the looser, so, for me it works ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f4aa.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60f.png?v=15.1)

I like your style, this is the best way to make this strategy consistent.   
I was wondering what you mean with the sentence "i suspected positioning" why did you take this second position in this area ? and maybe if you can be so kind and post a chart of the first position you took, thanks alot. keep it coming. 

consistency wins

Thanks. So basically you only take the trade if Stochastic on a 5 minute chart is over 80 at the time of the signal on M1? What about your TP? Is it according to the original rules?

For short over 80 or is going down.  
  
TP is with the rules.

Hi Minako  
  
I like your interpretation of how to trade this method. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)  
  
I think you are absolutely right about waiting for a quality entry either double tops, 200sma or 25 levels are all good places to enter.  
  
This strategy is succesful because of the 3:1 RR and 1 trade per day. I too am not so keen on obeying strict rules of entry and in fact to be honest I think Paulus too sees them more as guidelines than hard and fast rules.  
  
The whole basis of this strategy is to choose a direction to trade, on whatever method siuts you then look for the best entry in that direction. If down look for some quality resistance to sell under and if buying look for solid support to buy off of.  
  
Once in the trade hold for a 3:1 return. Simple as that. Paulus has given us a first class entry method with his stoch and macd but also I might say only take these turns off of solid support or resistance.  
  
Another thing I like is to wait until the macd gives a deeper signal so ignore the smaller turns.   
  
Anyway I'm sure my post will cause upset amongst many of Paulus's disciples who like to have firm rules to follow. So let me apologise right upfront and say sorry but hey, why not keep an open mind and just trade the strategy as you see it and let other s trade it their way, after all its their money.  
  
But if this post upsets Paulus then I will quietly leave and as suggested by JPR go and start my own thread looking to work with like minded individuals who want to trade this strategy as best as they can.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/270c-fe0f.png?v=15.1)  
  
Lets hope we have a better day tomorrow.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f911.png?v=15.1)

Feel the Fear and do it anyway!!!

Ive looked at this some months aga and alot of signal I had taken in the past would of been ruled out ..  
  
All i did was to take the stoch we use 5,3,3 amd multyply by 5 ( 25,15,15 ) so that both the stochs were on the 1 min page

Thanks for this post I really appreciate it. I'm not against using the entry signal (MACD and STOCH) around areas of S/R. I think its as good as any other entry signal out there (MA Cross etc).  
  
It's just that this thread is for a particular strategy which is very mechanical and (at the moment) the results are very good without changing anything.  
  
I think it is great idea to work with like minded individuals on other ways to trade this, however it wouldn't be this method, it would be another method, albeit using the entry signal from this method.  
  
I myself am exploring taking the first signal either way (no bias) first thing after Frankfurt open, and then again first thing after London open. I decided to test this after Strada's excellent set of test a few pages back.  
  
However I'm doing this myself and not posting on this thread those results because at the moment the results from the original method are more than good enough to make a lot of money.  
  
I hope this makes sense and sorry if I came across as moody to anyone, it's just that I've seen so many threads just plummet into garbage and I really was hoping this one would stay pure to the original, simple method.  
  
Anyway thanks for input everyone.

As long as the founder of the thread isnt complaining we should all stay cool, and dont act like thread sherrifs. This thread has place for every one, and every thought that could make this strategy better or suitable for more persons.   
I for myself dont believe in a holy grail system where you just wait in the morning for a signal to take - without thinking and analyzing a little bit into it. Minako is not hurting anybody or spamming this thread. We should be much more concerned about the noobs that still after 70 sites come in and ask which 2 hours we are looking for to make a bias, this is what really is annoying. 

consistency wins

I had the same trade executed by the EA written by Kuma and it was also a loss. The good news is that the EA seems to work really good on EUR USD - M1.

you could be right, and i'm really not bothered about the direction this system goes, i'm just having fun with it, not taking it seriously

i meant no offense. and to paulus and everyone who are indulging me arigato gozaimasu. and just to emphasize, there's nothing arbitrary about PA. double/triple tops/bottoms, bounce off from whole numbers/ resistance/ support prices.... highly mechanical. having the right indis to support your entries (such as paulus') then it makes it a powerful combination  
  
  
  
PA has already moved more than 70 pips in AU. paulus' system said "short" on a bull market (dang!)  
  
a sell signal bounce off of R2, perfect short!  
  
knowing that it will be a counter trend trade, i trailed SL to +17, like any sane trader would do fighting a market trend.  
  
+8.1%, 9.5/14.5, 5 losses, 9.5 wins.  
  
by monday a new capital will be purely just made from profits. thanks again paulus, for introducing the system and the MM logic.

I have been watching this thread for sometime now. Yet I have noticed that many people are having problems with 1m chart. I for one use high leverage and high equity to place my trades. Due to the fact of my high leverage. My stop loss is that of 4.5 points of my entry. To me I think using bbands formations and fib extensions really help a lot.

I agree. Everyone wants 1 100% winner. Honestly to many indicators creates trading bias. Which is why a lot of 1m trader lose funds. If your enter a position, and go 5 points in red before 5 points in green. Your chances of closing at 10 points profit before 15 points in red is less then 5%. If we focus on a 5 point stop loss. Trust me 1m will be much different. Anyone can create a graph saying I entered here. Yet only the trade really proves it.  
Please look at my entry on the short. Along with when I took profit. That to me is a perfect entry.

Hi Forex_people  
  
I'm always interested in the trading techniques of successful 1 minute traders as I love the tight stops and the need for only a 20 to 30 pip move to return 3:1 plus winners.  
  
For instance if you are regularly using 4.5 pips as your stop, then a 20 pip move will give you a 4:1 return which means you can have 4 losers and 1 winner and break even for the week. Nice odds!! Also if using 5% risk, thats 20% growth per trade.  
  
Or even better with just 2 winners a week thats still 25% growth per week which would double your account every month. As Paulus is aptly demonstrating here.  
  
So for me this is the reason this strategy is working so well, the tighter the stops the smaller the TP target, so obviously its easier to hit 20 pip winners than 200 pip winners.   
  
I know, I know, its all been said before, but heres my piont, if we can perfect a tight stop entry method then thats half the battle so I am very intereted in your entry method. Can you elaborate more?  
  
Are you acheiving a 2 out of 5 hit rate?  
  
Are you using 4.5 pips as a fixed stop?  
  
Could you demonstrate with a chart how you are using Bbands and fib ratios to acheive such tight stops?  
  
Many thanks Clive. 

Feel the Fear and do it anyway!!!

definitely agree. that's why if you look at the bottom of my latest trade, one will see the details of the trade.  
  
5 pips maybe too tight esp for any indicator-lead-entry positions.

Since the banks in the U.S. are closed on the 4th of July, I guess that precludes trading EUR/USD that day. Am I correct?  
  
Also, do we expect to see a slow down in volume over the summer?  
  
Thanks,

I wouldn't expect the London Open to be too badly effected by the USA holiday especially as we are only looking for 30 or so pips but the afternoon session will probably be quiet.  
  
Just my opinion.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

What many people fail to see while trading in 1m is the science behind it all. You can avoid 99.3% of all your loses for a gain, if you simply bet against yourself. That's called what ladies and gents? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f647-200d-2642-fe0f.png?v=15.1)

Forget 30 points. 30 points is now 600% profit. Without reinvesting free margin which you gain during the run. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f647-200d-2642-fe0f.png?v=15.1)

Anyone regonize this formation on 1m chart. This is with Bbans set to CLOSE period 14 devi 2. That means the middle white line is the MA 14 ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f911.png?v=15.1) Look at the behavior on every recross. With the numbers telling you when a previous high was created. All BREAKOUTS start at the cross of MA 14. You can back test. You will notice on a recross a 4.5 stop loss is safe enough to take about 6 point on avg, usually when candle closes against the current trend. Breakouts leaves no tail. Its constant pressure. They always come with SIDEWAYS or SHARP reversal of middle band. The first 57 seconds of a 1m candle mean nothing. Why? Only because when you backtest your only back testing a every 60 second HIGH, LOW, OPEN, CLOSE, COLOR.   
I have an indicator which indicates when a high or low has been rebroken. You also see that on charts with you use 1, 2, 3 elliot wave indicator. Most imporant fib is 100.00 Thats the breaking of the Outer bands. That is where the massive pressure starts at. That is how you also ID FLAT trading.

I'm sure lots of people would be interested in your ideas but it is obviously different to what the OP is trying to get across so it would be good forum ettiquette to start your own thread and present your ideas there.

Kuma, first i want to thanks you for coding this EA.  
  
I have been doing some backtesting with your EA and have found some issues when the operation is a Sell. Find this example for 6/28.  
  
The EA triggered a buy when the market bias was (negative) for a sell.

From what I see the EA identifies correctly as a negative BIAS that your still trigger when macd > macdPrev and both negatives (dark red to red) and stoch is < 50\. However the rules for a sell are with macd values in green (macd < macdPrev and both positives) and stoch > 50.  
  
In Buys i have seen than in general worked OK.  
  
Thanks

Do that every week and you (and all the somewhat silent followers) would be happy... Great results still Paulus.

1 is it possible to trade with fixed stop loss? wich combination of settings i should use to have this (with 3:1 RR of course)?  
  
2 if i wish to trade without bias, should i use start zonestarthour and zonestophour as the same hour i will start to trade? sor for example: zoneStartHour 6, zoneStopHour 6 and StartTradingHour 6?  
  
3 and would be nice to use magic number, so we could use for example 2 instances to trade 2 sessions.  
  
thanks for the ea.

Here is the latest version of the EA with fixes to some of the money management and the EA taking the wrong side of the trade in a few situations.  
  
Let me know if you run into anything else that isn't working.  
  
Thanks.

For me it was long. The 2hr high was taken out 2 minutes before open meaning look for longs according to the rules.

Hi   
  
Great trade but can i ask how you chose AUDJPY? Do you always trade it? Or have you a system for choosing best pair to trade?  
  
Cheers Clive. 

Feel the Fear and do it anyway!!!

Here is an updated version of the EA to fix the issue where the order doesn't set the stop loss and take profit. I also added another parameter called TradeBias so you can turn off the bias and take the first buy / sell condition based on the rest of the rules.

yesterday was a loss UNDER THE ORIGINAL rules  
  
Will update figures later  
  
Im very close to closing the thread or banning certain members and deleting posts ,it has been hijacked developed into some thing I cant recognize  
  
The original system was mechanical and took no thought process or market anaylsis  
  
I dont mind the odd development,,ie dont look for bias EU to London open but take the 1st trade as suggested by another trader here..or increase stop size as suggested by Peter E  
  
Without sounding rude start your own thread on your own setup any one reading the thread from the start will no be totally and utterly confused.  
I dont want that  
  
I know the thread under its original format does not promote activity as its only 1 TRADE A DAY  
  
But the brief was   
  
1 trade a day  
Mechanical in its approach  
  
Im not willing to discuss the subject or argue merits of one against the other

I don't mind some modifying after all it's what we do but looking at price action using pivots and chart patterns was not the way I wanted to go its all about 1 trade per day with a winning trade 3 times the losing trade ...... True I may be looking for a better entry but more mechanical not subjective I was looking at the fib golden number for example ie we wait for the pull back to reach the golden ratio then enter with mcd colour change . The setting and placing of the fib is 100% mechanical so it will use the same points every day ie the hi and lo of EU session . ....this is what I mean by modification trading pivots chart patterns is a whole new subject

I added a parameter call IsBrokerECN which should take care of the issue of the SL and TP not being set. I tested it out on Sunbird and it works.

ok goodbye, i will trade without posting anymore, goodluck to all of you, but take care there is no mechanical system that will create profit for a long term without thinking, after all its possible to get a long series of losses. 

consistency wins

We know ! And you can identify a trend enter on a pull back or rally that's price action trading but anind is doing it for you if you would like to post all your trades for the last 4 month I'd be happy to look .... You also will get 5,6,7 losers in a row the secrete is risk return and the % game good luck to you and that's not a sarcastic good luck   
  
I too have traded off of price action in fact I day traded us stocks for some one else on thier account and although the strike rate was. Dry hi I found the pressure immense and when I was I'll or having problems at home or any kind of stress my judgement analysis suffered and so did my trading hence I only go for mech now

I like the 1minute 1trade system. I’ve been trying it for a while. I am working, for now, so I have to take a day or two off to trade it. I believe in the KISS rule. Also Albert Einstein’s quote: Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler. Also in this case, not more complex. (Unless it is truly needed). I have been seeing, daily, changes others have been making to your system. I say, if you want to change it, move somewhere else. Keep up the good work and thanks for your thoughts and help.

it oppened a trade at 6:13, that was coorect, as there was a signal 6:12, but the first signal was 6:01 and that should be the signal to take. Plus, ther was a signal 6:08. Do you know what could be the reason the EA recognized only the third trade?  
  
EDIT: same with the signal of london open, there was at least 2 signals before the signal at 7:30 (wich was the signal the EA took), 7:03 and 7:18 were valid signals for me. And 7:14 too (alttough it was a change from dark green to red, but paulus took a trade like this and this really makes sense because price was rede before this dark green).

Paulus, do you prefer we open a thread only for EA? I think as this system is mechanical, there is not much problem, but as it is your thread maybe you prefer this way.  
  
And thanks for sharing your ideas.

Kuma, it seems that automatic SL/TP determination is not working for me. It always uses the MinStopLoss parameter Setting.  
  
What would be the automatic SL value that the EA would be setting?

I can believe that would cause lots of pressure.   
  
Going for mechanical does make sense in this way, never looked at it that way. You would still need a firm believe in your system though.   
But i do like this one so far, and agree it should not be up for change.   
Thnx Paulus.

Good day everyone  
  
I see Up Bias.  
  
But I have a question, if this line (1.2586) is broken before a buy signal we have down bias ? am I right ?  
  
Best regards.  
  
EDIT: and it is broken ATM. So, DOWN BIAS .

Your arrow is after 8:06  
  
6 bars after London open is your signal bar and you STOCH was under 50 at that time  
  
right where your MACD turns bright red

Step 3  
  
  
We now need the MACD to go red this is going to help us find the best retracement  
Within the period the MACD is red we need the Stochastic to be below 20  
  
The vertical line in chart B shows this  
  
Step 4  
  
  
We now need the MACD bar to go from dark red to red as in chart C and we need the Stochastic to be below 50 at this point  
  
  
Dont know, maybe i misundertand something

Check your stoch settings.   
  
Remove the 'signal' line (set colour to 'none')

For a good signal in an up bias market Stochastic needed to swing below the 20 level, MACD if green needs to go to dark red then red. Once MACD gose from dark red to red wait for the bar to close. If bar closes with stochastic still below 50 and MACD red then take the trade.

Kuma, today again the EA did not take the first trade at 7:07, after the close of the signal bar at 7:06.   
  
  
It entered at 7:12, but at least in my MT4 the stoch was above 50 at this time.

What if the bar closes with stochastic under 20 when MACD is red. Does it mean it is a valid signal or it has to be above 20 but below 50 as it is appears to be on all sample charts?

It would be rare that the STOCK will still be under 20 when a good buy signal arrives. I like to see the STOCK rebounding from the 20 before entering and yes below 50.

Many thanks. I am trading the NY Session without bias. I had this situation on Tuesday at 14:14 when MACD turned red but Stoch was still under 20. I have attached a screenshot. Would you take this signal? I took it on the live account and it was a loss so I was wondering if it was a proper signal for future reference.

Yes I would have taken that trade.  
  
Wait a minute...no I would not have taken that. I trade with the bias and only 1 trade a day after the London open. What did the market look like prior to that signal?

The stock doesn't have to be above 20 and below 50, it just has to be below 50. If its still below 20 then it's still a valid signal.

it is only with me that this MACD bugs and start to show bars in both sides? I mean, red and green bars at the same time.  
  
i don't know if Kuma's EA use this indicator, so this could be he cause of wrong entries.

I have this problem generally when I look at the historical data. I re-load the template and MACD looks clean again.

I've added these lines directly below  
MACD=iMA(.....  
iMA(.....  
**green_buffer[i] = 0;**  
**DarkGreen_buffer[i] = 0;**  
**Maroon_buffer[i] = 0;**  
**red_buffer[i] = 0;**  
  
This resets all buffer and only the buffer that results from the calculation is filled/used

Sorry, i have to say i have just winner for the last 3 weeks. But i really really wait of the second stoch.  
For me, its important.  
  
I am done for this week, my trade today.  
  
oh, and i set my sl ever on the head/bottom from the semafor bubble.  
  
I say it again, the system is really good, also without the filter.  
  
On the last week, other people was done before me, but for me its ok to wait of the 2. stoch  
  
  
have a great weekend.

Hi There Paulus  
  
I'm watching your thread i'm still learning forex i'm missing discipline in trading, but that's another topic. I track you progress and i like what is see I have just one question about your MM.  
  
I've read a lot, and once upon I came across at topic that no matter how good edge you have that eventually you will get losing streak of 8 losses, the guy is speaking when we hit first loss on the next one to reduce the risk to half, then if again we hit loss the one more time reduce risk at half, and keep that risk until next win and than you can go back to your standard risk per position.  
  
In this case its 5 % > 2.5 % > 1.25 > 1.25 > 1.25 > 1.25 >1.25 >1.25 > approximately 13 % draw-down   
  
Did you consider something like this in your trades, you can make a simple spread sheet and see the calculation, that way you will preserve a lot's of capital, and when market is good again you hit win you go back to regular risk per trade.  
  
Because this week you hit 5 losses with 5 % but if we include MM reducing size of position that would be 18.6 %, if the trend continue and you get 3 more losses, you would be down 30 % to 16737.  
  
And if you try the above MM with reducing risk when on losing streak, you would be down to 20847 which is 13 %. Someone would be shaken after 8 losses and 30 % draw-down. The Psychology plays big role here.   
  
Maybe you don't have troubles you know you have edge, but novice traders would be shaken.

Keep in mind what happens when he gets loss loss win loss loss win which is more probable than what you are suggesting. Where are the profits then. You can go back over what Paulus has posted and give the results he would be at now had he done it your way you are suggesting. I know it is just a question and you are not telling what to do, but as I said, you could come up with your own answer if you liked.

You know I never watch these things but seeing it started out with a fellow Aussie and was posted by you I gave it a good watch, infact I watched it all.. I'm glad I did and thank you for it. I wish I had that info a few years back, it would have changed my perspective and more so my expectations and attitude. All new traders (and possibly some seasoned not so successfull ones) should watch this and see if they need to adjust anything in their game.

you need to present a full plan  
  
for your proposed MM, what if we have a win, loss, win, loss, win, loss, win, loss?  
  
and winning% and losing % will be:  
  
-5%, +7.5%, -5%, +7.5%, -5%, +7.5%, -5%, +7.5%,  
  
this is dramatically different from  
  
-5, 15%, -5, 15%, -5, 15%, -5, 15%, as it is supposed to be.

Thank you Paulus, for sharing your system and for the video. I agree with JuicyT... Wish i had been aware of the stats involving the number of losing trades in a row you should expect.... a few years ago... oh well ! Guess whats important is what happens from now!  
  
Anyway just wanted to say to anyone reading the thread that the video is a MUST watch.

Question for today's signal.  
  
initial signal at 8.10am had the stoch over 50 so not useable.   
  
the stoch then came back below 50 on the close of the 8.13 bar and MACd was still light red.  
  
For me this completes the signal within a reasonable time.  
  
How did others play this??

Hi Paulus, might need to tweak the rules in post #6. I think most wouldn't have taken a long yesterday because price didn't breach the EU session high before the long signal you've indicated. In the last chart of post #6, you show an EU range break south so looking for shorts, but then price returns to the EU range and you're still looking for a short, not a long as you've posted above.  
  
No way meant as a criticism, just keen for everyone to be completely clear on setups - it's a great system.

I took the short signal after the low of the EU was broken. So it was a loss for me. Had not seen the information in this system about price coming back into the range.

...depending on where you set the stoploss. 100% by the current rules might have knocked you out for -5%.

Hi Sidefx, the main problem I see with such a SL is that it created a TP of over 20 and the range for the previous few hours was only around 20 so now you need a breakout for your trade to perform, that's a big difference to trading a retracement which this method is based on. Paulus has always kept his stops fairly tight and this makes sense, this method works best on relatively quick trades, it's about retracement on 1 min charts, if the trade goes on for too long then it becomes something different. If you need your trade to do too much work in a confined range then you increase the chance of failure.

Agreed. It's a -5% day unless you used discretion on the stop, which Paulus has done in the past.

I use spreadbetting for execution but an MT4 chart for setups - so, you get the signal from your MT4 chart and modify your entry/SL and exit prices to fit your SB chart...is that right?

Just another thought, nothing fancy.  
  
Look to take your trade outside the band, its no holy grail, you'll miss some trade and most definitely lose some.

Hi Paulus,  
  
you seem to have profit and loss levels and % on one of you charts that look like fib levels, is this an idicator or did you draw them manually....or is this s feature on MT4 that i'm not aware of....?  
  
Regards  
Paul

Good day evry1!   
I am very new here, I av been taking my time to study this thread from beginning but at the moments I am still far behind around page 8 cos I want to av a very good understanding of the system b4 usage. So I decided to try it out today though I am not too sure if my settings were correct. The chart below shows the details of how I placed the trade. D challenge I had was how to detect the right price for SL and I only had to use 1:2 of MM hence I wasn’t to sure but I ended up a winner with +15pips target.   
Chart below for comments please..  
  
Green horizontal line for sl @ 1.22290  
red vertical and horizontal lines for entry @ 1.22213  
blue horizontal line for tp @ 1.22055  
  
  
I had wanted to enter from the first orange vertical line but I noticed the stoch was below 50 so I had to wait for the right one.  
  
  
Thanks

Thanks for this Mark but I've had it on a demo account and it hasn't taken a trade all week - am I missing something? No errors, nothing showing up in the logs. I have set Make Trade = true...

A small variation in broker feed makes a large difference to the win rate it seems.

After 10 losses you should only be down 40%

You can expect far more than 10 loosing trades in a row when trading a system with R/R 3:1 because the hitrate will normally be lower the higher the R/R is.  
I don't know what the hitrate on this system is. Probably nobody knows yet but i guess somewhere around 35%-40% at best.  
I don't know how many losers in a row to expect on a hitrate like that but far more than 10 i am sure. And then maybe you get a couple of winners and you can have many losers again. If you google you can find mathematical formulas to calculate things like that. Nothing is for sure of course but you can get a idea of what to expect.  
To have a lot of losers is not a bad thing. All systems with "low" hitrate and/or high R/R have "many" loosing trades. It can still be a very good system.  
But i don't understand why so many of you gamble with this VERY HIGH risk. With 5% risk you are doomed to fail... But that is just my opinion...

For now, since I am in the U.S., EST, I can only trade a day or two a week, when I take off from work. I plan in leaving work, for good, soon, and want to continue Forex trading.  
I have been seeing statements here like, 40% loss and not one win in 10 days.  
Is that how it is going with 1minute 1 trade lately, or are those just bad experiences.  
Thanks,

That is not "how it is going with 1minute 1 trade lately". That is just how trading and the markets works.   
If you just read the post before yours you will see that 40% loss in 10 days will happen regularly if you use 5% risk pr trade but that is not the worst. If you trade a 100% mechanical system with R/R 3:1 the hitrate will make you blow your acc if you use that huge risk. That is not something that can happen at worst case. It will happen. You do not need a lot of experience in trading to know that. Just look up some statistics and math formulas and you will see there is no way around it.  
  
Why not just trade the system with "normal" risk? Then you will probably make money. I have not tested or even studied the system but from what i can see in the first posts it seems logic so i will not be surprised if it is a winner. Maybe even a big winner..? Who knows...? If everybody trade it "kamikaze style" we will probably never know.

It's   
Obvious if you risk 5% per trade it can add up quickly, but a lot less damage than otherwise. I know 5% times 10 days is 50% possible loss. Of course the 3 times that or 15% take profit will, hopefully, recoup the losses. It’s just when you see others state it in black and white it is a little unsettling, but I understand. Thanks for your response, it helps me to focus.

You are welcome ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
I hope other people also understand that 10 losers in a row is very normal for a system like this.  
Earlier in this thread Paulus posted a video here: [http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...19#post5822519](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5822519#post5822519)  
Around 20 minutes in to that video you will find a formula how to calculate expected numbers of losers in a row if you know the hitrate and so on. Like i wrote in my last post we don't know the hitrate for this system but i guess we are not to far off if we say around 35%. Then that formula tell us that we will have a losing streak of 25 sooner or later.  
  
Here is a screenshot from that video:

It sounds like people keep forgetting that if you risk for example, 10% per trade and you get 10 lossers, you do not wipe out your account. With every trade after a loss, the lot sizes do decrease when you size your lots by %'s. With every trade after a winning trade, the lot sizes increase.   
  
Keep this in mind when you begin to worry about 10 or 15 losses in a row.

agree  
  
after 20 losers in a row a £1K account would sit at around £358, after 30 £214 and at 50 losers in a row £80.

I think that on the 1 min timeframe to achieve 3:1 you are going to need a spread of about 0.2 from your broker. Because most of the swings are only about 10 pips or so.   
You need to have a small stop to achieve that, on that time frame . Some of you people are having say 7 to 10 pip stops on the 1 min charts, trying to get 21 to 30 pips target. To me thats way to much, a lot can happen in that time frame and you could be open for a hour or so to try and acheive that.  
  
I would be looking for 10 pip swings and a 2:1 risk reward or maybe you need to go to the 5 min charts for the 3: 1 .

That is correct.   
And something else many traders also forget is that it will take far more time/trades to recover after a drawdown when you use % of the acc for lot size. (I am not saying % of the acc for lot size and MM is bad. I use it myself)  
For simplicity lets say you trade a system with R/R 1:1. And lets say you have a very bad period and after 20 losers in a row you are down 50% of your acc. You will not be back where you started after after 20 winning trades because you have to make 100% profit to get back.  
If you have several losing streaks with only a few winners here and there in between (that happens to all systems and all traders) it is very hard to get back.

Best observation in this thread by now. I said that in PVT to Strada too.   
  
Could i get an answer to that newbie question? There is any ECN broker wich will do the job to trade this strategy? [Oanda](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile") have 1 pip most of time or there are requotes and slippage that will make impossible to trade this?

..... Don't discount that statistically the same maths applies positively as well.  
  
As we're dealing with pure probability a starting bank of £1K would see £1.1m if you have 50 winners, those odds may appeal to some people.

Well.... the problem is that with a R/R of 3:1 mechanical system the hitrate will be to low for that to ever happen, but 20 losers in a row WILL happen...

Thanks everyone for the comments on losses. I was getting a little shaky about it, and it’s good to see different rationale to the reason and affect. The thing that concerns me is I have been using trading systems for about a year. Some robots. They all work for a while, and then, when the market conditions chage, they stop working. I always thought if the trading system didn’t change to allow for the market conditions, the system is doomed. It’s good to see people sticking with the system as it is and are still confident in it.  
Thank you all.  
  
Frank

That formula might be accurate for a coin-flip type of application (with very few variables), but for an environment like the EUR/USD forex market, there are literally 100s of different factors involved. Simply judging future probabilities on past hitrates is not necessarily going to be accurate. Given the very nature of the EUR/USD market and the timing of entries in this system (London session - generally very active), a break in the biased direction is going to happen often enough so that 25 losses in a row is nearly impossible (I'd like to say completely impossible, but my experience says that nothing is completely impossible). In fact, given the criteria from post #1, I'd say that even 10 losses in a row would be very rare.  
  
Something "very major" would have to happen in the EUR and/or USD economies to alter the volatility of EUR/USD to allow for 25 losses in a row. In this case, one would think that a smart trader would notice such an event and suspend the strategy before 25 losses.

What we have been talking about the last couple of pages here do not even have to be in the neighborhood of accurate. It is good enough for a discussion like this to know that many losers in a row is what can be expected regularly. But before people start trading the system live with real money it is of course important to have some accurate numbers and statistics for those trading it.

I have not been reading the whole thread and i have not tested or studied the system but as far as i can remember the reason i started posting here was because i see someone posting that he already had 10 losers in a row, and the testing of the system have just started. So it seems to me it is not at all rare. Maybe he was wrong or maybe he did not follow the rules? I don't know.  
Anyway i agree that 25 losers in a row do not sound like something that is very likely but to say something is impossible and can never happen is very dangerous when it comes to trading.

You can calculate the effect to your trading capital by these simple formulas:  
  
Loosing streak,  
  
(1 - % / 100) ^ streaklenght  
  
Winning streak,  
  
(1 + % / 100) ^ streaklenght  
  
For example the position risk 10% (huge) and you have a 10 trade streak:  
  
Loosing: (1 - 10 / 100) ^ 10 = 0,35 (35% still left)  
Winning: (1 + 10 / 100) ^ 10 = 2,59 (capital now 2,59 times the original)

It comes down to market volatility  
  
  
  
I agree with the 3;1 RR you may get longer losing runs but dont forget big dif here  
  
  
We are not setting a TP of 50 pips( risk) x 3 ( 15%) = 150 pips  
  
  
We are taking the risk ,some times 8 pips and aiming for 3 x that = 24 pips  
  
  
The ATR on EU atm over 20 days is around 100 - 120pips per day  
  
  
Its the entry thats critical for 3 x RR ..hit the right place wanting 30 pips with an ATR of 100 pips its very doable

Very true, this is what traders are forgeting. For Pualus' system to work for you, you have to committee 5% of your acc balance in each trade.If you calculate it well, you only need roughly 35% success rate to have a profit on your acc. Anything better than this success rate will give you decent returns. Besides, your acc will withstand 20 straight losses(it will be satanding at about 35%).

Hi Fame of Me  
  
I am very inerested in that filter of yours (stoch 55 15 15). I tried to set it up as you siad but it never looked any where close to yours(with the colouring at the bottom or top). Any where I can sown load it?

No  
  
Look at any trading method in the real world and you will see draw downs  
  
watch the video I posted  
  
Real traders have real draw downs as long as your MM is in place then whats to worry about you have calculated your risk  
  
If you dont like 5% trade at 1% its all down to your personal belief and emotional resilience to draw downs  
  
You may be after a great smooth equity curve but for that your going to need a system that gives you 90% strike rate  
  
There are loads of traders on this forum who boast 90& 80% strike rates taking 10 pips a time but look at thier stop loss 30 or 40 pips I dont want to trade that way  
  
Or traders that average down on trades and end up blowing the account on one trade that went wrong as they kept on buying in to get the average they needed to get out lower  
  
I know on each trade my max loss is 5% if I looked at all the stats out there I wouldnt do a thin in life  
  
Agreed in the stats there may well be a period of 50 losers in arow but that may not happen in my life ..may not happen for 5 years 1 years who knows  
  
So trade with money you can afford to lose take funds out of the account as you make money   
  
To sit back and do nothing because of what my happen is not the right approach  
  
I know if I jump out of a plane I have a 1 in 10,000 chance my chute wont open...it wouldnt stop me jumping because I have calculated my risk.

the sectetet on 1 trade per day is the entry  
  
we make a few calculaations based on what the market has done since EU opened  
  
Do we think the market will rise or fall based on our findings  
We then have to pick the entry to get the max gain  
  
We want the price to move just 3 times more in our direction than 1 times against our direction  
  
Look at the chart for Friday  
  
We picked the correct direction..we just needed to enter in any 1 of the 3 green boxes  
  
Unfortunately we entered at the arrow  
  
Crack that and we have a system that gives us 3 x rr once a day  
  
Dont forget  
  
1 win out of 5 gives us -5%  
2 win out of 5 gives us +15%  
3 win out of 5 gives us +35%  
4 win out of 5 gives us +55%  
5 wins out of 5 gives us + 75%  
  
For the week

I viewed the video. Like you and Paulus implied, we will have a losing streaks. It’s good to see they could be prolonged and are just a matter of statistics. Just use your system, sit back, and let it work for you. Losses are part of the process.

Use dynamic position sizing and you do not need to think this. Just know your pain limit and put the risk for that level.  
  
Example:  
  
If you risk 2%/position and you have a 10 trade loosing streak then if you want to get back your capital you have to have 10 trade 2% winning streak (or the aggregated result of +10R).  
  
Now if you rise your risk to for example huge 10% then it is the same. After having 10 trade loosing streak you will need 10 trade winning streak (or aggregated) to get it all back.  
  
This means that there is no difference is your risk bigger or smaller (of course if your trading capital goes too low you do not meet your margin requirements).

Ok. As long as people don't worry about it i guess all is good... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f644.png?v=15.1)  
  
Just remember it is very different to trade to trade a system like this (and most other systems) with the same lot size on every trade (like Paulus do in his examples) compared to % risk of the acc. It is two completely different MM that have dramatic different effect both when the losing streaks come and when you are trying to recover from the DD. It is VERY different. And the difference shows far more and faster the higher the risk you are using of course. If you are not aware this it can really hurt you.

Simply adjust your used risk to the required level. If there is a great probability to see longer streaks then take that into account if it pains too much.   
  
The message is that it will take the same quantity of success to earn it back if you use dynamic positions no matter the risk size (except margin requirements).  
  
The system itself does not have any influence to this the streak length is the key.  
  
Anyway the dynamic positions are worth to look.  
  
Just my opinion and definitely will not work for all as anything else either ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

I guess you are talking about is R/R 1:1 trades here right?   
Well.... if you risk 2% pr trade and you have 10 losing trades then you will not win back your lost capital after 10 winning trades. For that to happen you have to use the same size on all trades. And you call it dynamic positions.? I would call that static positions if i should give it a name. But the name does not matter. What matter is i don't get it..

And what are you saying here??  
The way i read it you make it sound like you can tell before it happens that there is a "great probability to see longer streaks" ?  
Losing streaks or winning streaks. Does not matter if it is one or the other but are you saying you know when they come?

Well.... if you risk 2% pr trade and you have 10 losing trades then you will not win back your lost capital after 10 winning trades. For that to happen you have to use the same size on all trades.  
  
Yes that is the point, originall 2% stays as postion size for the 10 trades.  
Say you risk 100$, next time another 100$, which is a bigger percent as you continue loosing...  
I´ts the only way of coming back straight with this idea...  
My problem is 35 % winners on a constant basis with this" idea..."  
Just that, constantly, should make you a billionare...above that...well...a big billionaire...

Thanks for this wonderful strategy, paulus..  
I have read this thread for a long time, and traded on a demo account as well.  
  
I began with $1000 on the demo account and now 1 month and 14 days later the account is up in the $2500.. I risked a maximum of 5% per trade and my take profit was on 15%..  
  
This strategy works really well, and I love that there's only 1 trade a day.  
Combining this strategy with the stoch indicator gives me a strike rate of 48%.. Which I believe is pretty good. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f4aa.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60f.png?v=15.1)  
  
The longest row of losses I have had is 3 in a row.. So an advice to the others following this strategy is to not worry very much about having a lot of loss trades in a row.  
  
Also, try to take the first signal when it comes. Waiting too long and trading long after London Open will not give that good results..  
  
Of course 1 month and 14 days is not enough time to say if this strategy is stable or not, but we'll never know if we don't test it!!  
  
Good luck with this strategy..  
I am sure everyone following the rules will get good results..

Yes that is a MM you can use if you want to get back from a DD with the same number of trades as you went in to the DD if you trade R/R 1:1 and it can also be used for this system of course. I have used that MM myself and some variations of it in the past.  
But that is not what people are talking about here. They say risk 5% pr trade. The MM you are talking about is risk some set % for every all time high on the equity curve, and for all other trades use the same position size as the previous trade.  
I guess that is what Prosentti calls "dynamic position sizing". Maybe that is the name of it. I don't know.  
Anyway it sounds like a gamble (that are doomed to fail) to me to use 5% pr trade on a "low" hitrate system with a MM like that, but that is just me. I guess for other people it is ok..?  
  
Early days yet so it is hard to say but so far the system itself look like it may be a winner. Thanks to Paulus for sharing it.

This is correct. It is all about the frequency. If you trade only once per year then you can use big risk percentages (5% or even more). But if you do 30 positions per day your should definitely use smaller values. Very often it takes for awhile until you understand the real resons for the things happened so you can adapt but if you have only few days to do this then it is too late. Also it is not wise to adapt after every small streak of losses. Loosing is a part of this as we all well know.  
  
It is so system dependent what % you should use.  
  
Let's say you trade 30 times per day. In a very bad day you can go all wrong and after the day you are in the -20R situation. So, how much do you stand the pain with your -20R ? If it was 2% risk then it means you are down 40%. Way toooo much. But if it was 0,1 % you are down 2%. This may be acceptable ? No right or wrong listen to yourself, know your system and use your common sense.  
  
btw. I do not know this system what this thread is all about so I cannot say the correct values. Even thought I know you allways have to take into account yourself. People are different. They perform differently the same trading rules etc.  
  
btw2. Yes I was talking about the DYNAMIC POSITION SIZING where you calculate your position again every time you are going to open your position. The size is a calculation of your pip risk and current trading capital. You adjusting your position size so that if you will meet the stoploss the end result will not exceed your risk % per trade. By this way if you for example lose 10 times in a row and then you have a 10 time winning you are back to the original situation. Put up some spreadsheet or take a calculator and check.  
  
_BUT if you do not know where you are going to get out of your position (=pip risk) then things will get little a bit tougher. Must be calculated another way._ I read this thread from the beginning (few pages from the start) and it seems this may be the case...  
  
Guys do not take this as an attack to this system or anything. Just an idea which can be very useful for someone.  
  
Be happy and trade well.

Today was a winner.  
First signal stoch was below 50 so no trade.  
Second signal stoch didn't go above 80 so no trade.  
First VALID signal marked by down arrow. SL and take profit shown.  
  
P.S - So glad we had five losers in a row and this thread has got back to the original method.

Thanx JPR - you have confirmed that my settings are correct! I have tried to edit the opening times on the Market_Open_Lines.ex4, but it doesn't let me - it keeps reverting the default so my opening lines are out: I need the times to be:  
  
Sydney_Open: 0  
Tokyo_Open: 3  
London_Open: 10   
London_Close: 19  
Frank_Open: 8  
NY-Open: 15  
  
Can anyone assist?

Dear Jpr,  
  
Would you mind taking a peek at my chart and tell me were I have gone wrong with my signals. According to my chart, I get a sell signal earlier than you. But being very new to this system I am sure it is me who are in the wrong. (It would still have been a winner though). Just need to get a why/why not on my chart.  
  
Thanks

Not sure if I'm missing somethig.   
People who are adhering to the rules exactly to the point had 10 loses in a row.  
Paulus had 6L 2W 2 L.  
In the same time Paulus is stressing to not add any other rules, just keep it simple and trading exactly according the rules without discretion.  
  
So what makes this huge difference? Is Paulus adding his discretion to the rules?

There can be multiple explanations for the discrepancies. The spread could differ, the reading of the chart, the difference there are between brokers and their price (you'd be surprised how much they actually differ from time to time), adding some arbitrary rules suggested by other traders and not Paulus, difference in the SL setting, so on and so forth. But it is actually quite easy to check up on, just plot in the lines for the last 10 trading days and see how they pan out. If you see a difference, I think Paulus would be more than willing to help you out on why his and your setup didn't match. Or some of the other traders here.

Is anyone using this EA today?  
Need some advise on my setting, I thought there is a valid signal when london open, but i didn't get any alert.  
Thanks.  
  
I'm in Asia GMT +8, so my Eur Open is 2 EST and London Open is 3 EST according to [Oanda](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile") server time zone.  
  
The other setting i left as default.  
Thanks in advance.

I can.  
  
Bias = Sell  
at 10.03 Stoch was above 80, getting ready for a signal  
at 10.07 MACD turned dark green and Stoch was above 50, took at short position at 1.2287, SL at 1.2296 (a couple of pips above swing high)  
at 10.24 I was stopped out  
  
Today was a fast loser. The times are from Alpari UK, so if you want them in LONDON time deduct 2 hours

Hello,  
  
May you share your setting of the EA with me?  
I'm not getting any trade alert.  
BTW, i'm using the EA named Marks1Minute1TradeEA_v2.mq4  
Hope it's the same one as you guys are using.  
Thanks.

The bias was short and the first valid signal came BEFORE the high was broken. They are the reasons.

You are right, not on your chart, the MACD bar which are dark green on our charts at :07 is light green on your chart. Good for you. The difference was 0.000001 on MACD, between minute :06 and :07. That's not much

On Alpari UK (Demo), I get the same result as Jpr, however on MB Trading (Live) I get the same as Fame of me. Just goes to show that results may vary (of course) from broker to broker.

For me I didn’t get the short signal before it just peeked above the Euro high, very slightly. So I took the long. Accurate or lucky guess here?

Your bias settings aren't default as per method, you are only using 1 hour prior to London opening, have you found this works better than 2 hours?

How are these EA (Expert Advisor) settings used. Aren't EA's robots? I thought 1minute 1 trade was a manual program.

Hi Frank, yes if you have set trading rules can can create an EA "robot" to trade the fixed rules over an over again. It takes a lot of emotion and second guessing out of trading. I only trade with EA's. You can only use them on the Meta Trader platform.

Do you measure to the minute bar of :59 or :00? Today, if measured to :59 the bias was sell, however, if measured to :00 the bias would be buy?

Euro only opens an hour before London. So based on that bias is UP. Looks as though yours Euro set to open 2 hours before London. Need clarity from Paulus as to which setting is correct.

I am measuring from what Paulus is doing and he is most definitely using two hours before London. I know this, because I have compared Paulus' charts and his linedrawings with my chart. So today, according to Paulus, the opening was 1.22877 (on Alpari UK). However, I am very much in doubt if the Euro Close was X:59 (1.22849) or X:00 (1.22913). Please see attached

If you look at Paulus chart from page 1, you can see he's measuring two hours: [http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...0&d=1336295942](http://www.forexfactory.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=956180&d=1336295942) and according to how he has drawn in that chart, the bias was up and the closing bar he's using is X:00, so the bias was up anyway from the get go

Both exchanges open at 08h00 local time and London is 1 hour behind Frankfurt. Am I missing something?

Use Market_open_lines c from [http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...28#post5640928](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5640928#post5640928)  
  
There you can see the difference is also two hours. Adjust the hours accordingly

I don't really care what opens when. All I know is that you're not following the rules Paulus laid out. Remember to adjust the times according to your metatrader server

You are right, my bad, the stoch was above 50. Oh well, I just have to see this pans out to my advantage. Am I right that the buy signal should have been X:59

Thank you so much for answering my question. I am fairly new here and had no idea you could set up EA’s. Actually, that’s how I found this site, looking for how to create EA’s, but this is the first I have heard of it here. As I said before, I have used them before and prefer them. I have no trouble pulling the trigger to start a trade, but have wimped out too soon and not made as much as I could. Now I can trade with them until I quit work. Then, continue with them after I do quit. (Shush, don’t tell my wife I can trade, and keep working too. Hahaha).  
  
This means a lot to me. Thanks again.  
  
Does anyone know Paulus’s view on using EA’s?

Do you just save the EA settings in a file? (maybe Scripts). If so, how do you execute it? Just drag the filename to the chart?  
  
Thanks,

Hmm... I am not sure if i understand you correct (or maybe you are just joking..?) but you make it sound like you think you can just download a new untested EA made for a system that is also new and almost untested and start trading it? If that is what you are thinking you have a lot to learn.  
Please don't take this in a bad way. I am just posting this so you do not go live with money with some EA you just found. I am sure not even the creator of the EA do that.  
But i probably misunderstand your post..

Think the !RobertSessionOpen EA only knows how to short - no long trades have been opened. (No trade opened yesterday or today)

Because the last 2 weeks have not been successful at all. And FYI to Fame of Me, he isn't following Paulus rules, so even though he had a winner today doesn't mean anything, really. If he did, he'd have stopped out as well

Why?  
It was long, i take long and get my tp 12 where is YOUR problem?  
And when you are not able to see a pivot, this is not my problem, and i think paulus is also able to see pivots and S/R line ;-) think about this

Sorry, she. Anyway. If you followed Paulus rules you would have entered at 11:39 Price: 1.22542 SL: 1.22425 TP: 1.22893  
  
The stoch signal came at 11:23. Anything else and you haven't followed Paulus rules. There is no other way.

You are NOT following his rules at all! First of all, there is a buy bias already when London opened. Second of all, the stoch signal did not come before 11:22, the buy signal happened at 11:39. Stoploss must be set to the lowest point between frankfurt open plus a couple of pips and TP must me set to 3 times the number of stoploss pips. Those are the rules and you are NOT following them at all.  
  
**Your problem is that you're not waiting for a STOCH signal below 20 and MACD in the red!**  
  
Now read what I wrote, before you answer. All you do is confuse, because you are not doing it correctly!

COMPLETELY WRONG! You must wait for a valid Stoch signal first! It must be below 20 and macd in red. TELL ME WHY DON'T YOU WAIT FOR THE STOCH SIGNAL???

Sorry Spaizkadet  
I think maybe4 you need to reed the rules from post1, the stop loss is the nearest swing low before the signal candle, nothing to do with low of franlfurt session, secondly Fame of Me was correct with his entry, exactly where I got in on my platform, you got in late on your platform, and yes Ihave been trading this from day one strickly as per Paulus Rules

Listen, your times must be way of, because everybody else including Paulus is using the times I am using. Why don't you use you pretty little eyes and look at my chart. You are the one who's in completely wrong here and you are not following the rules! But hey, I don't want to waste my time arguing with you any more. I feel sorry for all the others in this thread if they follow your noise!  
  
P.S. why don't you post your graphs completely with times showing and all, like I do.

Okay, I give up. Please show me the entire chart with times so I can see your entries and please take a look at my chart and tell me where my stoch signal should have been.  
  
So you're saying that this post [http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...98#post5641398](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5641398#post5641398) shouldn't be understood as the low point from Frankfurt open?

I would still argue, that even if my SL was wrong, you don't wait for a valid stoch signal. As I have understood it, stoch must first be below 80 with macd in red. Where is your stoch doing that?

It touch some candles before the 20 where is YOUR problem.  
  
When you are not able, to talk about sl right, then you are not able to trade this system right, sorry, this is what i think.

I agree, my stoploss is wrong and I apologise for that. Geoff set me straight. However. Show me your valid stoch signal! I don't think you can. Below 20 and red macd

spaizkadett isn't that wrong  
as described in step 3:  
"Within the period the MACD is red we need the Stochastic to be below 20"  
  
that wasn't the case here  
we had a cross above 50 before macd went below 0 for 2 bars  
but if I'm not totally wrong, Paulus would have seen this as a valid setup, because when macd changed from maroon to red the stoch was below 50  
  
even if you would ignore the "below 20" rule there will be for sure brokers where you didn't see the maroon->red transition because of the different datafeeds.

Hi Spaizkadett  
Your stoch and Macd seem to be in the correct place, but that is not what I was trying to say, your stop loss should have been at low of hammer candle 2 candles before your entry at1.2248-2pips(2246) this was the nearest swing low before youe entry, this would have meant your tp was less, however on my chart(alpari ok) my entry came at 11.28am , your entry was ten minuites later than mine or Fame Of Me`s. Hope this helps

I agree completely, my SL is wrong. I had interpreted Paulus wrong there and I apologise for my outburst. However, according to my chart (Alpari UK), my entry didn't come before 11.39, before that all macd candles was darkred. So as far as I can se, my entry was perfect, however my SL and therefore also my TP was way off. I wonder why my macd was 10 minutes later than yours and if I may say so, I think my entry would have been better since my entry price would have been lower than yours

Also, I wonder why you didn't get stopped out if you took the 11:28 entry. What candle did you use as swing low?  
  
And it seems to me that Fame of Me made the buy entry at 10.35 and not 11.28 like you say, if I can count the minutes of her chart correctly. But prior to that there hadn't been any macd/stoch signal, that is for sure. I wonder why she hasn't addressed this yet

I was indeed stopped out pretty much straight away.My entry was at 1.2263 and I took the swing low at 1.2260-2pips as my stop , when I entered trade stoch had been below 20 for a least 5 candles and had come up and was at about 30 or so on entry, macd had only posted one correct colour to go long at this time but as per rules I took the trade, tp was 18pips, but sl hit at-6

So wouldn't you agree with me that the entry of Fame of Me was wrong?

Having looked again at FOMs chart it does seem that his stoch had not gone below 20 so yes not by original rules, sorry my bad,

Worst part is, if I just had understood the SL correctly I would have had a winner today

Im quite happy with the growth of the account   
  
This now gives me 2 good mechanical systems  
  
The 1hour  
The 1 min  
  
Im now with drawing funds from this account to invest in my 3rd mechanical system  
  
This uses Renko and has been very successful for me so far  
If the system carries on the way it has I will start a new thread and post all the details

Iv had a few pvts about my post so let me clarify, I always funds new ventures from funds won it gives me an emotional edge. I'm funding this new ventures from funds won here   
  
I will still be trading this strategy and I will still be looking to improve the entry to gain a better strike rate. The exit has to remain the same to get 3:1 rr we need the TP to be 3 x the risk  
  
I will only post changes if they look viable

It's funny how charts and as a result indicators are a little bit different from broker to broker. Add to that the human element and we are all trading the same system but our own way.

I got 1.2102 with my SB company I entered as the bar on my MT closed which was an upbar .I got a good fill ...the next bar went up a couple pips then closed as a doji  
  
My SL was set to 1.2108  
  
TP was 1.2084  
  
Which was hit on my SB platform

Hi Paulus,  
  
Nice little system!   
  
How do you determine where to place the stop loss once the bias has flipped?   
Did you simply use the high of the pre-London open?   
  
If I'd traded this yesterday I would have used the "support" (if you can call it that on the M1 ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)) area at 1.2108. So I would have traded:  
  
Long @ 1.2118  
SL 1.2108  
TP 1.2151  
  
See attached image. Vertical red line signal, horizontal red lines bias change (high of the last hour) and stop loss. "Lime" lines are entry and TP. I appreciate this is probably the discretionary element of the system.

So Paulus,  
  
In this case how much pips your stop loss?  
it shows less than 3 pips so how you calculate your 5% risk?

Let me try:  
Assuming account size is $1000  
  
5% x $1000 = $50  
  
So 3 pips risked then we have $50/3 ~ $16 / pip   
  
1 Lot = $10/pip   
  
So position size is 1.6 Lots ($16/pip).

..why did you set the SL there? Should have been at last swing low before the signal, at 1.2138-9 ish. Losing trade today.

The chart was wrongly posted the correct one shown above I set the SL there because thats the lowest low between the Euro and London open

See Paulus' post 1412 above as an example of the correct SL placement....needs to be nearest swing low/high before the signal.

I took it short. It broke the low of the Frankfurt open (plus it had a good H1/H4 bias to back up going short also - based on my other trading methodology).   
  
Short @ 1.21486 (could have been higher but a little slow on the keyboard).  
SL: 1.21539 (previous swing high 1.21529)  
TP: 1.21327   
  
Risk: 5.3 pips  
Reward: 15.9 pips  
  
I didn't risk the recommend 5% ... but stuck to the 1:3 ratio.  
Back testing this is giving some great results.... will fit in nicely with my other trading strategy.

Good for you ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) Paulus uses a 2hr period to determine long or short, so today's signal was long.

He used Frankfurt Open to London Open for direction which is a 1hr difference, rather than the 2hr difference Paulus uses.

my low of FR session was 1.21378 at FRopen, thus low wasnt broken as signal occurs... 

I never lose - either I win or I learn...

I made a mistake and didn't have to pay ... Lucky ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
Still back testing of the 1 hours difference is still profitable. Will see what a 2 hour bias does to my (back-testing) results.

There are those here using the Frankfurt open - London open for bias, which gives a 1hr difference and the original rules from Paulus use a 2hr difference ie an hour before Frankfurt open - London open.  
  
I suggest you google FX session times to ensure you set your indie correctly and in line with your broker feed.

You are using Frankfurt open to London open which is a 1hr difference. You will see form Paulus' posts that he uses a 2hr difference ie an hr before Frankfurt open.

Without altering the basic strategy I think today's signal is also a lost trade on EUR/USD I did not take it though because I woke late. LOL, I would have entered at 1.2292 (the red vertical line) and I must have been stopped out by now

Hi folks,  
  
I know there is a bunch of tools out there to do this already but I knocked this out in last couple of minutes. R is a great free statistical analysis platform that is used in everything from astrophysics to social sciences - and finance.  
  
You can download R from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/) (<http://cran.r-project.org/>).   
I nicer interface than a rustic RGui is [RStudio](http://rstudio.org/) available from [here](http://rstudio.org/) (<http://rstudio.org/>)  
  
Once you've installed R or RStudio you can copy and paste the above code snippet into the console and call it like this:  
  

Inserted Code
    
    
    # long example
    tradeCalc(1.2510, 1.2505)
    
    # short example
    tradeCalc(1.2510, 1.2515)
    
    # an example with extra arguments... and today's signal
    tradeCalc(1.22953, 1.22891, 2000, 0.03)

  
The output for the last example above....  
  

Inserted Code
    
    
    Entry:  1.22953
    Stop:   1.22891 (6.2 pips)
    Target: 1.23139 (18.6 pips)
    Lot size by risk level:
              3.00%
              0.97

  
**EDIT:** If you find it useful let me know and if want to suggest some change please do so.  
  
Looks like it didn't work today ... next!  
The price action was against us today ... see then pin bar on the M30.

We must be ready to give the market something when it demand it from us such that we will get back from the market what we want too. Its a rule of give and take. The lovely thing about this is that its just a trade per day

Hi Paulus and all,  
  
This is my first attempt at this strategy.  
At the first vertical line I missed the long which would have been stopped out.  
1\. Would it have been a valid entry?

Then with the low broken, I went short (a bit late), so, 10 SL, TP set for +30. Almost hit, but still open.  
  
The thread title suggests 1 trade only.  
2\. so had I been stopped out on the first one, should I then quit this strategy for the day instead of taking the later entry?  
  
  
Comments, please.

Correct entry, you used a 1hr pre-London bias which gave the same signal as Paulus' 2hr pre-London bias. You pays your money, takes your choice.  
  
1 trade per day.

This system is not my king, i trade it just for fun 1 or 2 times a day.  
No matter with which filter 2. stoch or ma50 - with both a winner today.  
  
i stop to post in this thread someone ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1) was pissed that i talk over different ways to trade this system.  
  
Best luck to all.  
This is a nice little system standard or with one more filter.  
standard you get a fast entry, with filter you have to wait longer but less looser.  
  
Nice weekend

Hi all,  
  
I modified the indicator posted in the thread by **iwjw**. Very nice coding ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)!   
  
It now:

  1. tallies the number of past winners and losers.
  2. draw stop loss and take profit lines.
  3. shows the breakdown of short and long trades.
  4. also shows the breakdown of winners and losers in each direction.

  
The entry price is calculated as the median price of the entry bar - so not the most precise method but sufficient for this pseudo back-test.  
  
The text in the top left of the chart is:  
  
Total: N Shorts: (NS, SW, SL) Longs: (NL, LW, LL)  
  
Where:

  1. N is the total number of traders
  2. NS total number of shorts.
  3. SW number of shorts won.
  4. SL number of shorts lost.
  5. NL total number of longs.
  6. LW number of longs won.
  7. LL number of longs lost.

  
On my terminal it tallied the last 40 trades.  
It took 21 shorts and 19 longs.  
Won 5 shorts and lost 16  
Won 7 longs and lost 12  
  
12 Winners  
28 Losers  
  
So the using the 1:3 risk reward:

  1. Strike rate (based on this data) is 12/40 = 30%
  2. Expectancy is 12/40 * 3 - 28/40 * 1 = 36/40 - 28/40 = 8/40 = 1/5 = 0.2

  
So if the last 40 days are representative (probably not due to low volumes and a lot of choppy side ways movement) this method can make money in the long run (assuming my adjustments to the indicator are bug free). The later assumption being the massive caveat for this analysis.  
  
If some can do someone do some testing that would be great. I'll check it out a little more tomorrow.  
  
Coding to-do:

  1. make better SL options
  2. use symbol digits rather than hardcode.
  3. commenting etc.

  
Regards,

Hi to Paulus, fame of me, the ea creator here , ... (we dont have any return from him by the way since weeks)  
  
Well, i ve taken the time, as a forex searchor i am and also trade a 1M system with regular 50 pips a day profit, to real all from the begining and put in a**file all the diffrents important details after 10 hours of reading all the day. I beleive all people serius would have to make the effort to do the same before waiting some answers to questions already mentioned (which make loose the time of the active member who already took much of their time for a free volunteer action there)**  
  
  
SOme comments.  
  
The system is really nice for many reasons . and i am also a fan of edisson, even if he was probably more a leader of the project than the conceptor himself.   
i would prefer however a 3% risk personnaly in the approach .  
  
_Questions to Paulus:_  
  
As an experiences member here mentioned, to take the first trade after the london session, may be better than to wait the draw of a trend for the 2 last hours.  
So, why you choosen to take this trend, is it by feleing or have you experimented really the difference between a first trade without past trend and your actual tredn.  
  
About the H1 system project , is it the same rules? Have yo utested it before or is it brand new?  
_  
Question for Fame of me (and for all):_  
  
First time i have the stoch in m5 11 3 3  
But now i have the stoch in my m1 55 15 15  
  
Lets try to make a 30 full trades day by day with this different ones to see the better  
  
_  
QUestion General  
  
_It looks like we could use this sytem, for 2 or 3 times a dayn and not only one. (including just after the NY session). It may be surprising good results and boost the account.  
  
Do some poeple use that point in the EA for instance? _  
  
Question for the EA conceptor  
_Is it possible to develop the system for many hours runing up to the tokoy session for instance  
And can you give us the result of such a backtest?  
  
_Improvement idea_  
  
I would expeirence it with a fixed stop aroud 12, and with different Ratio, including the R4  
  
_General question for all traders_ _living in Germany_ (in addition) but please would be nice to have the answer  
  
What is the tax in % you have to pay for the benefits you earn from the forex market? Including 2 options, the 1st is a secundary activite less than 500 euros by month lets say, in average, the 2nd is a principal activite  
  
This question is very important for all traders, i guess. Countries legislation about the tax on the forex can be very different in %  
  
_In addition suggestion to meet real traders for the fun and information ... Could be nice -)_  
  
What about, just a real meeting for forex friendship" between experienced traders, and even newbies, all who have good results proven? Next month, i should publish a real small live account summary, with some of my personal technical, it would be nice to compare the maximum Drawdown with Paulus, the activate members here. If everythnig should be as i ve worked in since many time, i shold get a 30% monthy return or more but with a low DrawDown around 12. The low DrawDown is a beautifull challenge, even more exciting than the performance itself, at least for my reasonable sight.  
  
Who live in Germany, and maybe Berlin from good traders experienced here?  
I thought about Berlin a nice citie to live or to pass holidays. What plans may you suggest to spend the forex money into Berlin? ahah.   
  
  
Cheers to paulus, and all

do you use the ism adr market" on your charts published when we see these 2 lines  
  
or the "adr today" given by another menber?  
  
fixed on the M5 and M1, im pretty sure we can find improvement for geting more pips, for the london session if the trend is well followed under and over as it is in some cases  
  
cheers Paulus, you had a electric inspiration from above with your system in may 2012, im pretty sure ah ah !!

hi, it can help also many people i guess  
  
i ve used the xemarkets brooker, as Paulus mentioned it , if i am not wrong (it has been fusioned with the old recently)  
  
i ve london open at 7 am and frankfurt open at 5 an  
  
the 2 hours difference are correct on this plateforme, but  
  
is it the good time? if not, is it possible to make a change for one hour ahead or before?  
  
about the europe phases" indicator metioned on one of the post, i cant have any clue about something![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f615.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/2753.png?v=15.1)  
  
can some peple help?  
  
on this plateform, we have this 2 hours difference, its great to know for the people who only have 1 hour on some others. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60e.png?v=15.1)  
but, what time should we consider for the europe open ACCORDING to the clock of forexpeacearmy ? so we all can be fully agree!  
  
cheers

Hi Paulus,

The difference between Frankfurt open and London open is only 1 hour. You can refer to this site

I'm new to this strategy too, but looks okay so far.

Hi Rezky,  
Most of this thread has been about the opening times rather than actual entries.  
Simplest way to to think of it is to forget about Frankfurt and use 2 hours prior to London open.  
  
It would be great if Paulus would put that in an EDIT on the very first post.

Being new to this strategy I was tempted to move to break even when it went about +15. I would have been out for no profit.  
But, I stuck to the strategy and left it for a winner.

Would those people who don't get the bias period please read and understand page 1 of the thread where you will find the description of the bias period is quite clear. It is 2 hours prior to London open ie the euro session up to the london open.  
There is no mention in the rules about forexpeacearmy or frankfurt open, if you want to use different criteria go ahead but let's not have any further futile discussion about Paulus bias rules, you're cluttering the thread with useless rubbish.

Atlante, if you go into "EDIT" on your 'market open times' and add 4 hours to all your current time settings, you will be on the right times. Your market open times are currently 4 hours behind UK times

Atlanti, if you right click on your chart it should bring up "indicator list", your "market open time" should be on that list, from there you can edit.  
  
Your chart at present is 4 hours out of sync.  
  
I didn't have the same trade as Bill earlier, my stoch was over 50 when MACD went to dark green, my trade came at 8.57 signal.  
  
I have continued trading this but other variations, however in respect to Paulus results not posted here but on the other thread.   
  
Re, the EA, never used them, trade with real money, EA's total taboo for me, OK for students, demos and IT wannabees.  
  
If you want the stats, PM me, strada.

this is a system thread, we can talk over the system and not how i change any indicator or how to set.  
  
sorry, this thread go in a mess and i dont like this.  
  
let us talk about how we can tune a little bit this system with one or 2 indicator more, but i think this is enough

Oops. So, my entry was a bad one. I actually shorted on light green and MACD>50\. Proper entry was later at about the same level. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61e.png?v=15.1)

I know Paulus likes to leave it on win or lose, but I moved SL to break even just before Wall Street opened as I never keep a small TF trade open around then. Out for 0%.

Hi sepramfx,  
  
I only the figured out how to do this the other day (after 12 months of trading with MT4)!   
I used to place multiple orders for the one entry so I could scale out more easily - this is much less painful to manage.  
  
So here is what you do:

  1. Right click on the order you wish to close part of (in the 'Trade' tab in your terminal)
  2. Select close order (just like you would if you want to close out the entire position).
  3. Adjust the value in the "Volume" drop down box to represent how much you which so close out (e.g. if you've sold 2 contract and what to close have set the volume to 1).
  4. With the volume set, you'll notice the yellow "close" button will have changed something like "**Close #1234576892 sell 2.0 EURUSD by Market** " to "**Close #1234576892 sell 1.0 EURUSD by Market** ".
  5. Now simply press the button close button and you've close out part of you position!

  
Naturally it will say "sell" if you've gone long and "buy" if you are short. Also you will notice if you set the volume to more than the size of you position it will disable the yellow button and only allow you to buy or sell at market.  
  
To the best of my limited MT4 knowledge this doesn't allow the trader to set pending orders to close part of a position.   
  
Hope that helps!  
  
Regards,  
  
ninety47.

I agree with you Fame of Me. Most successful trading systems on FF never remain exactly as they started. Along the way a few changes/ additions are made. They give birth to new ones when traders realise there are ways they can improve on the orignal ones to suit them better ( already we have "2 minutes 2 trades").   
  
I have strong faith in Paulus' system and if time allows, I want to make it my main trading system. If there are ways we can improve on the strike rate as Fame of Me said, then we would have the next thing to the holly grail. Imagine a system where you would bounce from a 10 or 15 losing streak with less than half the number of winners.

Jackub,  
Yes, I'm trialling the strategy for both London and NY open. But, I won't hold through Wall Street open (9:30am NY time). Today is a good example. I would have lost had I not moved to break even. Same for major news.  
  
I'll pop in tomorrow if I have any trades.

Hello and thanks for the thread, I am junior member here,  
I have been trading FOREX unsuccessfully for about 3 years,  
I was wondering what charting system is available to allow the customizing of the MACD into 4 colors.ie what charting package is Paulus usuing?  
I am using think or swim and not able to do it there.  
I downloaded MetaTrader 5 but also seems to have bugs and am unable to customize the MACD to reflect Paulus original template  
Regards  
Anthm

I'm using 8-3-3 Stoch settings, thus Stoch wasnt above 80 at 8:06h signal..

I found out what was wrong with my entry, Stoch wasnt above 80 before I took my trade, so entry was not valid.  
It was my first approach to the system   
:-(

Look at this post [#1454](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5883087#post5883087).  
  
I modified an indicator posted by iwjw (a large number of post back). The original indicator tells you when you've got a signal. I added advisory stop loss and take profit lines (they aren't 100% accurate but help with decision making) based on Paulus rules.  
  
At the risk of getting flamed ... I don't think this system should be 100% automated yet (I know that some are trading it that way). The bias between long and short is almost 50:50 and when you look at higher time frame price action the bias is often counter to this. In my opinion this is why the failure rate is on the high side - pushing the long term expectancy down. Some evidence of this can be found in the afore mentioned post ([#1454](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=5883087#post5883087)), although I note the sample size is small). Before turning this into an automated system I think additional work needs to be done on bias selection (hence my concern about getting flamed given recent posts). So a PA rather than simple price based filter is probably the next step to improve the bias indication (in my opinion). The challenge here is PA is hard to boil down to a binary value (long/short) - it has a good element of discretion to it - plus the clock used by your broker affects PA interpretation.  
  
  
Just some thoughts.

hello again, sorry if I sound like a newbie, as I said earlier I have been trading live for three years, overall unsuccessfully, I have been using charting package of think or swim, I see most here use metatrader as I am trying to get a handle on it I have downloaded this platform as demo account. I have searched the rookie’s forums to the answer my question but no joy. My question is how do I get my stoch and MACD looking and operating like Paulus charts?  
I am frustrated and would greatly appreciate somebody’s help and time. (i can get the standard MACD and Stoch of course but i cant get single line simple stoch and i cant get 4 coloured MACD)  
Regards  
Anthony

Anthm, you'll find the MACD and market open times indies on page 1 and Paulus template on page 2, download those and use them, your charts will be right then.

Hi anthm,  
  
The information your looking for can be found in the Platform Tech forum. You can search there for the answer or post your own thread and ask the question. I'm sure the people over there will give you the best (most direct) answer.

Please confirm the session start time. Does the Frankfurt session start at 7am or 8am Frankfurt time? Does the London session start at 7am or 8am London time? More importantly, when you say the signal bar was 8:03 am are you referring to London time? Thank you.

Hi everyone  
Taa, I can answer your question - Frankfurt opens at 8.00am Frankfurt time (their clocks also went forward) which is 7.00am BST at the moment and London opens at 8.00am BST (at 8.00am this morning) In a couple of months they will both open an hour earlier when the clocks go back.  
  
This is a great system - I've been demo-ing it and really like it. - Well done!![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)

Go to Youtube (or Google) and search for something like "Install MT4 Indicators and Templates" or "Install indicators and templates Metatrader4" or something like that and you will find some good short video tutorials.

Thank you for your answer. I had to search this thread for "Frankfurt" because I thought I missed something on changing the bias.  
Argh.  
Thanks,

Loss today here as well.  
  
I know, only 1 trade a day. But thinking of it, Paulus mentioned at some stage in the thread that one could consider waiting for a retrace to the 61.8; checked that fleetingly only but seems to hit the nail to the pip sometimes...  
61.8 of yesterday hi/lo is at 2290.

OK...long trade at 1.2258/1.2253/1.2273 would have worked...but just testing that 

I never lose - either I win or I learn...

Why is that? same time, same pair, is this difference because of different brokers?

You are using Stoch Close/Close and Fame of me is using Low/high. Maybe that makes the difference?

Using partial of Paulus outlined strategy.  
Use the high/low of 2 hrs before London open – and only look for entry when these are broken i.e. if high broken, look for longs and opposite for shorts.   
  
Use same entry criteria and MM as suggested by Paulus.  
My limited manual backtesting shows good results. Anyone else notice this?

Hi  
  
Are you allowed to draw trend lines? I'm busy setting up the indicators, etc  
  
Today of course was unbelievably volatile which means that break-out trading (break of trend line trading) may be the only way to not get caught out??  
  
Otherwise the system is great  
  
Sorry just to add that the red line was the high of overnight  
Fig 1 early  
Fig 2 later on

Just trying to help for those times when lagging MACD might not be able to catch up with extremely volatile trading conditions!  
  
I saw the signal this morning - nice buying opportunity for a few pips.

Just a question - seeing as the price reached 12290 which is another 50 pips at least missed out on - can one rather have a trailing stop?

Question to Jackub and umpats:  
  
Agree: bias down. But where were your entries??? Had two areas of MACD in the green but everytime the signal was lightgreen, the stoch was under 50. So no valid entry according to the rules (although first entry would have worked with a small stop). Please post details of your trades. Thanks.

Hi guys! I've been following this thread, and am very interested in this method. I was thinking the entry should be where I have marked with the red arrow on this chart.  
  
The mt4 clock is out on this so ignore the time. I was using 8am (in Ireland) as the London open.  
  
Can someone please confirm this would have been the correct entry?  
  
Much appreciated ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

you are right, my Stoch was at 49.62 at signal bar 8.52h, thus strictly speaking it wasnt a valid signal...but I think that is splitting hairs...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)!

Hi  
  
I got a different signal at exactly 9.30am - sell at 2370 and TP at 2350  
  
I have also got the system up and running on GBPUSD and got 30 pips over there too! Very easy signal to read on cable because it's been a full scale down move this morning.

This system is mechanical a has a great potential for an EA, but looks like both progammers abandoned the thread.  
  
No one is willing to write a new EA?  
  
I think there are a two options that would be good to be tested:  
  
1 Option to choose a fixed stop loss and take profit  
  
2 Option to choose start time and end time with no limit of trades.

I was curious if anyone would enter on that.. I was going to but got cold feet because i didn't feel there was a great enough bias for the 2 hour period.  
  
Taking just the 1 hour before Ldn open, the bias was more clearly positive, so I was tempted to go for that instead.  
  
What is everyone else doing?  
  
edit: Looks like I also missed long entry on eur/gbp @08:09

I held out as it looked like it would break the high, as it now has. So I can start looking for valid long setups.

OK...that is benefit of hindsight, anyway the bias was down no matter whether strong or weak, just sticking to the rules will produce longterm success...IMHO!  
  
I ask everybody to post his trades **before** the fact!

Hi umpats  
  
I noticed that you were also trying out the "price_bounce_off_MA" expert advisor. Did you ever get it to work? I have tried it out on every setting but it never opens a trade!

Really, in my humble opinion (and backtested) you need to trade this system off the 5 min chart. One has to try to "see" the situation in order to make an informed decision - I really can't understand how anyone can see what's going on if you are using the 1 min. That's why the win/loss ratio on 1 min is quite poor. On 5 min chart in last 30 days, it shows 19 wins, 11 losses

you could be right...do you apply the same indicator settings and rules like 1min on the 5min?

> Yes I do. The basic system is excellent. The MACD_4CZ indicator idea is really clever. I just use Stoch settings (5,3,3) but I could be wrong with that. I use the p1m1t indicator set 1.00am to 7.00am GMT (to make sure I catch the Asian high/low). I also use the vegas 1 hr tunnel indicator (set at "0" risk level to get rid of all the fib lines) which I use as the "ultimate" dynamic support/resistance level for the day. I find the 62 EMA a useful MA to bounce trades off if one misses the first signal (often works out well).

jmtini thanks for sharing! I'll have a look at the 5 min in future and see how it works out ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Well it was a good morning with a nice signal at around 9.15am - 1.2380 which could have yielded nearly 50 pips. The big red arrow is a very nice idea especially when one can use one's other indicators to confirm it.  
  
Must say these indicators and system are the best I've found on FF - my grateful thanks to the guys who thought them up!

jmtini, would you mind posting your chart? I really didn't get it today.   
This might be a really stupid question...but what is the "big red arrow" you speak of?   
  
I have my fingers crossed it's an indi that says "50 pips here ^" ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
Also, I don't think anyone round here will think you're interfering. If anything I'd think Paulus would be happy to have ideas added. Just my opinion though.

Hi everyone  
  
I don't want to post conflicting charts on this thread. I do have my own thread (with another system) which I stopped posting to poor results. However this system really has got potential to deliver so I'm going to post my charts over on my own thread every day at 5.00pm and in the morning around 7.00am (with comments). Anyone is welcome to take a look after 5.00pm today (all times are GMT):

Those who want to continue with the 1 min chart can carry on posting here without me confusing anyone.

Good Morning  
Does anybody have the Mq4 file that Paulau used on his original posts on this thread, I have the template of his charts but i dont have the Mq4 file that shows the red fib type lines showing entry level then stop at -5% then 5, 10, 15 percent TP lines,  
Can someone please help me out by posting the file if they have it?  
Cheers

What did you use to develope this EA.  
  
I see one needs to use an MQL4 for most of this.  
  
Did you find an easier way to do this.

...i don't know the codes in general, I picked up the %$ tip from BoBokus' fib thread years ago. Google will probably be your best bet to find the list of codes.

Funny you should ask that, right at the time I was putting the trade on price shot up over the level I was going to place my stop. I ended up setting a pretty large stop (compared to other I have set with this system) and as it's worked out price has now traveled well above where I was stopped out.

I'm forward testing as follows:  
  
Long SL: last swing low minus 1 pip  
Short SL: last swing high plus 2 pips + spread (1 pip)

Hello boys & girls,  
  
1st time in the thread but following and back-testing a while this wonderful system.  
Today my stop was .83 and it went just half pip higher. A loss day.  
  
BUT. This fact also consists a high break of Eur-to-Lon open relatively early(session middle-b4 juicy part). For me is a bull trap and according a month's data if you find a nice retrace with same RR and day's high(or low for low break days) is inside reward envelope then there are pretty certain possibilities the day will be saved and not only.  
  
Though it's beyond this system with poor back-test data, and therefore a GAMBLE, today I'm going to take it just for the fun![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
  
Cheers to all and thank you Paulus. Keep up the good work.

yeah, the 1st long signal through my broker was invalid on the stoch as it was >50, but the 2nd signal @08:42 (London time) was legit. Different broker feeds give different signals sometimes.

Well that's up to you - it was a valid signal all the same at the close of the signal candle (08:42 (UK)).

Well I missed out on trading yesterday but made up for that just now. Had to use a bigger stop than normal thus the take profit was larger too... but none of that matted as it climbed up pretty quickly!

The entry point for this morning's trade was during the 8.16 bar, until that point price had reversed against the signal.  
  
Entering a trade whilst price is clearly moving against you is the surest way to lose money, don't understand why anyone does it.  
  
Bobinabottle, maybe not lucky, maybe just using basic trading skill.

Yes, don't dispute the time of the signal, but then what happened?  
  
Price immediately reversed against the signal, why would you enter a trade when price is clearly against you, that's suicide in this business.

Every trend from session open to London open has huge angle.  
Even if rules say about first signal it's irrational to take it and expecting a good long entrance near week's high.  
After all there must be room for Friday to go up. 

Don't Fight Forces, Use Them.

Since 15th on 8am bias trades I've had 4 wins, 3 losses using basic method/mm but probably different trading rules.

Paulus designed this strat to be purely mechanical and that's how most of us are forward testing this.

Hi Sidefx, using basic indies/mm as in page 1.  
Rules are geared to paulus's desire to capture retracements.  
On 1 minute on EU the SL/TP has to be relative. If they are too high the chances are that more than a retracement is needed to profit.  
So I use the tightest Sl's I can find (but not less than 2), no extensions apart from spread.  
More info elsewhere if you're interested, check in my profile.  
Strada.

I'm using Paulus' original rules including his 2hr directional bias. What's your '8am bias'?...a 1hr (7-8am) slot for the trade direction?...haven't been able to wade through all your posts to find it. Cheers.

On the 8am Bias trades use the 2 hours prior to London open.

Good day to all.  
  
The system looks and sounds interesting with some mixed results.Sounds to me that you guys are trying to fade the Frankfurt open also known as Frankie or the Frankie fake.Does anybody have any idea why the the person that started this thread abandon it?  
  
Does any body keep a trade record for these trades for the last 2months?  
  
The R:R ratio should be able to keep the system afloat for a while but seems like there has been some problems of late?  
  
Is anybody trading this system on there live accounts or are we still in the demo phase of it all?  
  
Hope someone will be able to provide some data for analysis so we can see if the system has some value.  
  
GOOD LUCK AND GREEN PIPS TO ALL INVOLVED

Hi Rooi,  
  
Look at   
Paulus Post 1144  
  
yesterday was a loss UNDER THE ORIGINAL rules  
  
Will update figures later  
  
Im very close to closing the thread or banning certain members and deleting posts ,it has been hijacked developed into some thing I cant recognize  
  
The original system was mechanical and took no thought process or market anaylsis  
  
I dont mind the odd development,,ie dont look for bias EU to London open but take the 1st trade as suggested by another trader here..or increase stop size as suggested by Peter E  
  
Without sounding rude start your own thread on your own setup any one reading the thread from the start will no be totally and utterly confused.  
I dont want that  
  
I know the thread under its original format does not promote activity as its only 1 TRADE A DAY  
  
But the brief was   
  
1 trade a day  
Mechanical in its approach  
  
Im not willing to discuss the subject or argue merits of one against the other  
  
P

FranksBiz you are a gentleman.Thanks for the reply!  
  
Do you trade this method live?  
  
I will be following from Monday.  
  
Do you by any chance have a record of your winning trades vs you losing ones.  
  
I myself do not trade with any indi's but do open my first trade at roughly the same time as you guys.  
  
Wish everybody great success!!!!![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

Hi,  
  
Yes I do trade live, but only one day a week. I work full time in New York and have to get up at 2:30 am EST that day so I don’t do it often while I am working. I hope to stop working soon and will trade daily then.  
  
I always compare my daily trade to the others posted here and I always match their plus or minus days. I want to try and keep my trading with this method as sharp as I can with only one trade a week.  
  
I use the system religiously without any changes.   
  
Paulis said he would make some changes to the system, but I think he abandoned it and did not.  
  
Good luck and happy trading.

Same thing with me -1R and +3R but it went much higher. Today will aim for short around 550-555 levels.  
  
Trade well.

Hallo everybody, great method for trading  
  
is this a valid entry, according to the rules (instead of london open, I use NY open)?  
  
the signal was on the first candle NY open (orange vertical line)

yesterday was a loss UNDER THE ORIGINAL rules  
  
Will update figures later  
  
Im very close to closing the thread or banning certain members and deleting posts ,it has been hijacked developed into some thing I cant recognize  
  
The original system was mechanical and took no thought process or market anaylsis  
  
I dont mind the odd development,,ie dont look for bias EU to London open but take the 1st trade as suggested by another trader here..or increase stop size as suggested by Peter E  
  
Without sounding rude start your own thread on your own setup any one reading the thread from the start will no be totally and utterly confused.  
I dont want that  
  
I know the thread under its original format does not promote activity as its only 1 TRADE A DAY  
  
But the brief was   
  
1 trade a day  
Mechanical in its approach  
  
Im not willing to discuss the subject or argue merits of one against the other  
  
P

Hi Paulus  
  
That's the reason why I insisted on people who wanted to trade your system on other time frames to rather come over to my thread. Just wanted to say that your indicators are great and they do work on the higher time frames. I find that the p1m1t indicator gives very reliable signals on the 30 min!  
Anyway thanks again.

Could you post your chart? I dont have a signal under the original rules.  
  
The signal must be after the London open i think.  
  
Thanks and good trading

Hi Frank, he may be gone but he left one of the best sets of trading tools around. Yes it needed some work done on it but this week using his original indies and RR on 1min EU I have net gain of 60.7% (75% compounded).   
  
You quote Einstein and I'm totally for that, this is simple and with the right trading strategy is consistently profitable.  
  
All the best, strada.

Hi,  
thanks for posting your chart.  
  
On your chart the Stochastik was under 20 before the London open. Is this ok with the original rules?  
  
Thanks

Something you may want to consider, if you get that close to your TP and decide not to take it then reset your SL to BE, nothing worse than seeing a good profit turn into a loss.  
  
My 8am bias trade today hit TP plus an extra 5.5 pips = 28.8%, Price was running so let it go until first sign of weakness.

Hey Strada..  
  
Could you or someone answer these couple of questions please..  
I got to the screen a bit late when I seen this trade so I thought it all looks good so I took it with profit but not sure of a few things..  
  
1\. Is there a time limit for hanging onto a trade as I entered this a bit late in the London opening session before it finally reached the target?  
  
2\. The distance between the Stochs being below the 20 before entry was a little way away, is that ok as a trade signal for entry or a no, no?  
  
Cheers,  
Adrian

Hi Ramjet, I haven't noticed much of a deterioration in the results of the later trades.  
If I'm looking at a trade entry sometime after the signal, I make sure I can get in at the original signal close price +/- half a pip.  
just my 2cents, strada.

Hi Ramjest, as far as I remember oryginal rules, Stoch have to be beelow 20 just before go up to produce valid signal, at your entry stoch wasn't beelow 20 and I am afraid it wasn,t valid buy signal

Hey Jackub,  
  
Thanks ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)..  
I was thinking that but I wasn't sure if there were some sort of allowances of some sort like so many bars after it was last below the 20 and it is still valid due to the Stochs being below the 50 at entry..  
  
Cheers,  
Adrian

Ramjet, nothing wrong with your interpretation of Paulus's original entry rules, he only specified that stox had to be below 20 whilst MACD was in the dark red zone, no mention of limits on the nimber of bars after that for a signal still to be valid.  
Good to see you using some discretion like this. The original concept is very good but the original trading rules were not profitable enough, they had to be adapted for decent profitability.  
regards, strada.

good point, Alex, we'll have to give Ramjet the benefit of the doubt and consider his trade as a "No Bias" trade. He made a profit, that's the main thing.

Hi Umpats, yes and no.   
If we're talking about the 8.27am signal, the TP was 6, it reached +5.2 (on the SNB news) then reversed so exit at BE.   
I didn't do this one today as I'd already done my two trades for the day earlier, 1 @ +15%, 1 @ BE (similar situation to above)

Strada, good morning  
  
You seem to have successfuly settled into this system?  
Which types of trades are you using: 7am/8am....bias /no bias and limited to two per day?  
  
Are you still running the spreadsheet please?  
  
Sadly it looks like Jpr has given up completely.

Hi Umpats, chart below for the 8.27am trade. Main difference is our SL/TP. I use the tightest SL i can get to keep the TP as low as possible. I don't go below 2 but the closer I can get to 2 the better. For me 4 and above I'll probably not take the trade. On a 1min chart for EU looking for a retracement a target of 12 is really a big ask in relation to recent price range.  
I've been trading this for several weeks now using this criteria and it's very profitable, and consistent.

Hi Rorieu, how are you, well I hope?  
Yes, it's going really well, I still monitor the 4 trades ie 7am Bias and NO Bias and same for 8am.   
I'm actually trading the first 2 of the day after 7am (7am No Bias, 7am Bias etc). last 15 trading days in profit. Now I'm heading for a fall, tomorrow's bound to be a loss!!!  
  
Yes spreadsheet kept up to date but some of it's getting a bit scary now, I've got your emailaddy, I'll beam a copy over to you.  
  
Shame about JPR's thread but he was trying to use the original entry rules which were making too many losses. This will only show profits with tight sl and low realistic tp's. I hope if JPR's around he might take another look at it and see that it can be profitable.

It's worth pointing out to look at these 2 points made by Strada as they are both very valid and important as I have noticed this in the short time I have been trading this..  
The trades after 7am definitely seem to be the most effective and reliable  
also..  
I've been getting to just over 1:2 return pretty easily and have realized thanks to Strada it is a big ask to expect a 1:3 return unless you can manage a tight stop which is doable as Strada has proven..  
  
Cheers,  
Adrian

I did not know that. I read this on the PDF of Steve EA and was going to ask about it. Thanks for the info Strada.

Strada  
  
I was puzzled at the "8:27" trade.   
My macd did not change until one bar later (8:28) by which time the Stoch had moved well below 50.   
  
The next available trade for me was at 8:37 and it worked out well - if left to   
run, a potential 1:4 win.   
I checked another broker, [FXPro](/brokers/fxpro "View FxPro Broker Profile") \- the same. You chart with ODL I see.  
Surprising the difference!  
  
One final Q, do you stop at two trades max or after a winner or.... what ?  
  
Thanks for the SS.  
  
What about our Andy!!!

Hi Rorieu, the different MT4 feeds do seem to do this, I've just checked one of my other MT4's and it's the same as yours. So as it happens your MT4 had a definite advantage this morning.  
  
I don't normally do "stop at a win" but sometimes it happens by default. I normally do 2 max but sometimes the trades can combine in such a way that only 1 trade is possible or if the first trade is late appearing and runs into the 8am trades again only 1 trade. The beauty of the 2 trades is that you have relatively few losing days compared to doing 1trade, likewise the "stop at Win" trades.  
Any queries on the spreadsheet, give me a shout.   
  
Fantastic about Andy, wee eck will want him to be King no doubt!!!  
  
regards, strada.

Many thanks for continuing to post your trades. It is extremely useful to see the actual entries / indicator settings.  
  
Its such a shame that Paulus seems to have left us as his system has so much in its favour and he put in so much hard work.   
  
Anyway just wanted to say "Thank you Strada for your sticking with it"

Hi Strada,  
  
I have been looking at your history in your profile to find your settings or entry requirements, its probably just me but I cant find them, could you point me in the right direction ?

Hi ya Eltax100..  
  
Strada is basically using the same settings as in the first post, I've attached the template for you to upload (make sure you change the Euro and London opening times to where you are)..  
  
The extra part of the plan Strada has come up with is that he get's his stop as tight as possible to get the high returns be it at the top/bottom of the signal bar, the bar he is trading or a tight reversal point..  
  
Cheers,  
Adrian

Hi strada,  
  
I very much like your take on this thread, can i ask about when you move to BE ?  
  
I am going to test with 2:1 ratio tight stop like you, would you recommend moving the stop to BE when we get to 1:1 ?   
  
any insights would be great

Hi Eltax, nothing wrong with trying 1:2 but not sure about going to BE at 1:1, think that would dilute the ratio so much that you'd struggle to get much more than BE most days.   
If you look at the results for last week which are fairly typical you'll see that most days on 2m2t you get a loss and a win, similarly on "stop at Win". Based on that your 1:2 and SL to BE at 1:1 might leave you treading water and not going very far.   
The results aiming for 1:3 are good, maybe you should try that, if you get to 1:2 and price is sticking a bit or up against any kind of barrier then take the 1:2.  
Anyway, whatever you're comfortable with, if you want the stats pm me your email address, the stats will give you a good idea of where the strength and weaknesses are, might help you to work out the best trading plan.  
strada.

Hi Strada. Did you take in consideration your personal rules in the results in the spreadsheet? Because in backtest i think is almost impossilbe to know if price went against you before the signal goes the right way.  
  
Can you give details about exactly what you did in consideration in that backtest?  
  
Many thanks again for share all this info.

Hi,  
  
first, thanks for keep up with this thread. i started to follow this thread at the beginning, but give up in august (holidays and trade are not good friends, at least for me).  
  
At the point i leave the thread, with the original rules, i had a 21% of profit (using demo), that is not much. Now i'm trying to catch up what's going on. I can't i find the spreadsheet mentioned above. Where is located? I would like to see a series of tests from anyone else, to check where my failures are (or maybe just get a different point of view).  
  
Thanks guys!! Keep it up!

Hi ya Pelota..  
  
You will have to PM Strada and ask kindly if he could send you the spreadsheet of his testing..  
If you just throw up some charts of where you had losses and your stops and entries we could all help to show you where the losses were from and how to correct..  
  
Cheers,

Hi ya Frank..  
  
Those are the original indicators from Paulus's post #6 so it sounds like you have them all ready so just drag the template onto a new chart window in MT4 and all indicators should show up on the template at once....   
If not add the indicators to your indicators file in MT4 and then bring up a new chart window and all indicators should show up automatically..  
  
Hope that helps ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Ok, now i see my problem , and why sometimes our entry points does not match: i'm using STO (8,3,3) instead of the (5,3,3) described in the initial page. Probably was confused by some post in between.   
  
Now i have to backtest ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1)

Yes, difficult to guarantee the accuracy in backtesting so could only go with the info from the chart. However I can't remember if I did adopt that part of the strategy to the backtesting periods. The info from 25th June is based on live trades and live testing and definitely employs that criteria.  
  
I couldn't get set up this morning, had internet problem, but looking at the charts yes there were two 7am trades this morning. The first one looks as though it got to 5+, close to target so may have closed at BE, difficult to say in hindsight, I'll log it as a loss anyway. The 2nd trade was the 7am Bias trade and was also a loss. the two 8am trades would have been in profit so a profitable day for the combos.

To save Strada a job, I will say that it is 5% and 15% of your account as per Paulus in the first post on this thread, HTH

Morning Umpats, Ozmacca correct, I aim for 5%/15% and work out SL/TP according to Paulus's as he outlined in post 527.  
Today's 7am was at 7.15am, it was the bias trade and also the 7am NO bias.

Strada,  
  
Where was your SL placed in this trade, was it above the signal bar or the swing high?   
  
Only reason I ask is if it was the swing high which is about 4pips from the entry and doesn't quite get that 3:1

Hi Strada,  
I'm still trading this in the background since we last chatted. But, not much success. Typically, I have 5 pip SL with 15 TP. That allows for setting SL behind last 1 min swing h/l. And if I can't get that, no trade.  
  
On your chart here it looks like you are entering with tight SL even if it's not behind swing h/l. Is that correct?

Hi of the signal bar which gave me a difference of 1.8 so made that up to 2.0 for the difference.   
It doesn't work out to 1:3 because I don't include spread in the calcs, which is why if there are extra pips available over TP I always take them.

so you use a max SL of around 2 pip or so and try to grab some extra pips after tp is met to take into account the spread?

Morning Bill, how are you, well I hope.  
When I did my initial backtesting this is what I found, the recent swing hi/Lo's were presenting sizeable differences from the signal bar close. And some like to add another couple of pips for good measure. Now that will create a relatively big TP.  
What I realised was that the wider SL's were not as productive as the tight SL's.  
I think the reason is simple. Paulus' indies are perfect for catching RETRACEMENTS.   
That was what he set out to do. We have to look at the basics of retracements here.   
Bearing in mind we're trading off a 1minute chart and on EU not the biggest mover normally.   
So our TP has to relate to that and this morning is a typical example. At 8am the overnight range is just over 30 pips, so if you're looking for say 15 pips or more, that is a big ask of a retracement trade.  
So my own take is that the TP has to be realistic in the conditions we're trading in.   
That's not to say the wider SL's always lose, Umpats is doing quite well with them.  
Just my personal view, not looking to cause waves here.   
8am No Bias lost, waiting for 8am Bias ( I know the hi was broken but as price came back into the range quickly I'll stick with the down bias)  
strada.  
  
Manai, not quite, 2 minimum but 4 and above I'll probably not do. strada.

ok cool thanks.  
  
I thought you already took the 7am bias trade earlier today, the one where you showed the screenshot. Or did you mean the 8am you're waiting on.

Umpats,  
  
Price moved down rapidly after breaking the high and gave a long signal, but I stayed out. Simply put, too volatile for our tight SL. Glad I did too.  
  
Strada,  
Thanks for the detailed (as ever) reply. That makes sense.

Yes I did take the 7am trade and then the 8am No Bias, I do 2 trades, the first 2 that appear out of the 4.  
Back on the subject of RR 1:3, today is a typical example. As I've said it doesn't always work out to 1:3 as 5/15%. By not including spread in the calcs the losses will normally be more than 5%. This doesn't concern me as the win rate is good enough to compensate and the extra pips on TP have in fact taken me over the 1:3 target in the last 2 weeks.  
Today's trades ~   
7.15am tp 6; exit +6.4 = 16%;   
8.27am SL 2 (+1 spread) = 3; exit -3 = -7.5%  
Net profit for the day 8.5%.

All the indies are from Paulus 1st page together with his template and all set as per his initial settings, stox at 5,3,3.   
However, i've just checked another MT4 which has exactly the same settings but the chart displayed the pricing from 8.12 quite differently and probably more like yours. There was a clear signal on the other MT4 at 8.12. And it would have been profitable. So I'll have to take a look at these different MT4 feeds, thanks for raising this.  
rgds, strada.

I saved the template to Meta Trader Folder, but whatever sub folder I save the template doesn’t show up on the chart under Navigator. I put the template into folders: Indicators, Expert Advisors, Custom Indicators, Scripts. Can’t see it. Is there some sort of unpacking or opening the file I have to do?  
  
Thanks,  
  
Frank

Hi ya Frank..  
  
Sorry about this!  
  
When you go into your C drive, program files, where you have your MT4 and open it up you should see a folder marked up Templates..just place the template in there..   
Alternatively I have a folder on my desktop with different Templates in it and I normally just right click in MT4 Template-Load Template- and then find the Template from that folder on my desktop to install..  
  
Hope that helps this time ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Cheers,  
Adrian

Hi Strada,  
  
In the set up do you require the stoch to be above/below 80/20 at the close of a bar or will you accept hitting 80/20 and retracing before bar close ?  
  
I attach an indi that has an alert which will pop up when the stoch hits 80/20, may be of assistance to others

Paludo, I don't use any kind of EA at any time. Calcs are done the old fashioned way, sometimes a bit of guesswork involved, if I'm in any doubt I'll base it on a difference of 2 and take it from there sometimes having to adapt during the trade.  
  
Ozmacca, I only use closed bars for the signals, but I remember Paulus did use that discretion on some of his trades.

Hi Umpats, post 1742 above explains.   
  
RR 1:3 5%/15% are targets for me, they're not set in stone, some weeks I do better than target, some less so. Had a double loss this morning, but after 14 days of profit, it was probably due.

Great job on the trades Strada.   
  
Since you only take the first two trades on a given day, I'm going to assume you never took the third trade that you showed in your screenshot.  
  
I've read time and time again that every winning strategy is a winning strategy based on a specific edge. More often that not most successful traders shoot for positive R:R and make that their winning edge. In this particular strategy I would say more or less the edge is in the RR and then obviously that coupled with the fact you take two trades based on the different criteria and that gives the right mix to be successful.  
  
Strada if you don't mind, what kind of compounded percentage return have you made on your capital over the last 14 days or since you started trading this live.  
  
Thanks

Brokers are going to effect each of us, my broker never got to 3058 even without allowing for spread in a TP, so no winner on [Go Markets](/brokers/go-markets "View GO Markets Broker Profile")

I used your second option, “right click in MT4 Template-Load Template.” The first option didn’t work.  
  
My MT-4 screen had a black background, and turned white. So I guess something happened. The Stoch and MACD kept working. The Paulus Market time indicators are working. The left top of the screen shows EURUSDpro, and four market pip prices. I don’t see anything to show the template is loaded. Is it? What happens now.  
  
This is an EA and it executes buys and sells, right? How do I change the time to my time in New York. I have the Paulus Market time indicators set to the correct times.  
Thanks,  
  
Frank

That sounds a bit off with the settings of some sort, it should like the chart in this picture...I'm not sure if your MT4 is corrupted and maybe a reinstall may help..if you want to put up a screen shot maybe I could see something of what could be wrong..

Sorry, I didn't realize you were expecting an EA..this isn't an EA as I'm not sure if an EA would work very well with this system as we are trading with tight stops with quick in and outs of the trades and I think a human would have to interact with this sytem for the best results.. To set the time lines you would do that as shown in the picture of just changing those 2 to be in line with the Euro and London open and you could set the other places to 0 unless you wanted to trade New York which I am not sure of the results..  
  
Sorry if I misinformed you that this was an EA..  
  
Cheers,  
Adrian

Hi strada,  
  
Thank you for sharing your chart.  
but one question why you not take a trade at 8.25 am which shows a valid signal with bias?  
  
another question. for your 7 am trade you take last one hour bias or last two hours?

Hi Umpats, I think you mean 8.35, if so then I didn't use it because there was no price improvement, price reversed away from signal. I use my trading platform prices for determining entry etc., not MT4.  
On the 7am trades, I do use the 5.59 close to 6.59 close for bias.  
cheers, strada.

Hi Strada,  
On my MT4 and spreadbetting platform, the price did not drive straight through my 2nd, 3rd or 4th signals, therefore I took the trades. Your chart shows the same. I'm scratching my head as to why you didn't take them? Same for my last trade.  
Trades were taken after signal bar closed with SL near the arrow.  
  
Analysis would be appreciated.

Hello Bill, I took the 2 signals as per the chart above. 1st signal was the 7am Bias (& No Bias) so next signal after 8am. Not sure what you mean about the other trades.

Hi Strada,  
In your post, #1760, you took 4 trades regardless of bias. ( I think)  
Then today, in my post, #1769, there are several such signals, that I took, but you didn't and I'm trying to figure out why? (Granted, I missed the 7am entry)  
  
There is probably something simple that I am overlooking. Your help is appreciated. Perhaps, you could analyse my chart and comment.

Hi Bill, I've been trading 2 a day for several weeks now and more recently I've been doing the first 2 of the day, if you check some of my previous posts you'll see this quoted often enough. The charts I've been posting of late are done to illustrate the 4 daily trades, ie 7am Bias & No Bias; 8am Bias & No Bias, but I'm not taking all these trades personally, as I say I do the first 2 that are signalled after 7am. As you'll know the 2m2t spreadsheet is all about the various combinations of 2 trades and how they perform so well compared to 1m1t. Hope this clarifies.  
  
With regard to your chart and today's trades, the 7am Bias trade (which as it was the 1st trade after 7am it was also the No Bias) was signalled on the 7am bar. That was it for 7am. Next trades were going to be after 8am and as it happens the 8am Bias trade was again the No Bias. For me these were the only valid trades today, both were done and both made profit.  
  
The trades you took after 7am were signalled but in terms of 2m2t I wouldn't have considered them as valid trades. No problem if you want to do the additional trades, personal choice, but you'll have to do some testing to see how profitable that will be.   
  
Your first trade was stopped out, no other way to play that one.  
2nd trade I wouldn't have entered as going by the chart there was an immediate reversal against the signal and didn't return for some time so no entry there.  
3rd & 4th trades were stopped out like the 1st one.  
5th trade was in fact the 8am Bias & No Bias trade and made profit.  
Last trade again like 1,3 &4.  
  
Bill, why don't you take another look at doing 2 trades, it works well and alot less stressful than doing what you did today, and a lot more profitable. I f you want the updated spreadsheet just let me know I've got your email address, I'll get it over to you.  
  
All the best, strada.

Strada  
  
if you wait to enter the trade after it goes in the signal direction then you have more pips (or fractions) against you. If for example you wait to enter the trade after 1,5 pips, then your stops is 0,5 pips from the close of the signal bar. That is correct? I am afraid this will not work... at least for me. Problably even the fact i am in Brasil (and there is not Forex brokers here) will afect my entries a lot since i need 1 or 0,5 pips to be successfull. Do you agree with it?

Hi GB, In thosa instances I wait for price to return to the signal close and a small improvement but not as much as 1.5 pips. Up to 0.5 pip MAX is all that is required and quite often when this situation arises price will be bouncing around in which case you get the slight improvement and price can jump back to the actual price or even behind again, in which case I'll enter anywhere in that area, and very often at the original signal price.  
Understand your concern about the reduced gap. If I enter at say signal price plus 0.5pip then I'll still keep the SL where it was intended to be. This means my SL has increased by 0.5 pip which means some extra exposure above the norm, that I just put down to an unexpected business expense.   
Over the period I've been trading this I would say that the savings from not entering non-performing trades far outweighs the odd occasion when I get stopped out with the extra half pip. So for me it is a business expense well worth paying.  
Not that I've done it but it might be worth looking at the number of trades that do reverse initially and compare the number of those which then return to signal price and entered for loss or profit with those that never return and would be an outright loss. If I get some time I'll take a look at that.  
What do you think, strada.

Thanks again, Strada.  
Just shows how two different traders with the same chart can have completely different results. I took way too many trades in the chart. Like I said, I got trigger happy. In fact I had been so cautious up to that that I had hardly taken any in the previous weeks. I'll settle back in and keep posting the results.  
  
I got the spreadsheet a few posts back, thanks. From the previous time we had chatted, it looked like 7am with bias and 8am without bias gave best results. While still close, 7am + 8am NB has taken the lead.  
  
One question, are you still observing the rule if the h/l of the hour prior to open is broken we then only look to trade in that direction?  
e.g. 6am-7am bias is up, we look for longs, but then 6am-7am low broken, we look for shorts?

More or less, yes and no!! If the hi/lo is broken but price comes back into the bias range fairly quickly then I'll stick with the original bias direction. If there is a signal immediately after the break and in the new direction then I'll probably use it. Does that make sense?

Yes it does. That is one of our original Paulus guidelines.

For me, market with emergency stop loss of 8 set. Then have ticket open at the ready to close at actual sl or tp.

This EA has been around since June, 2012. Have you updated it. Did it perform the way you expected it to. It appears to be a real EA that executes Buy and Sell orders. Am I correct.

Hey Frank..  
  
Don't want to be a party pooper but if you are going to use this EA please give it a seriously thorough work out as I feel an EA wouldn't be of much benefit with this system as I think you have to be quick on your feet with this system, altering stop losses all the time as 1 stop you could make a really tight stop with higher R:R then 10mins later you'll need a little wider stop.. also with experience you may be able to filter out the best trades to take giving you the higher returns rather than taking every trade the EA throws up..  
  
Try to be at the screen when you trade this system...at the end of the day the most you might only have to do is 1-2hours work for the day and get any where from 5-30% return for the day..Not sure about your schedule but I think it's worth spending that little time at the screen for those serious returns ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

You warned me about an EA here once before. Thanks for Jetting to my rescue again. It’s good to feel people like you help us traders in many ways. It’s good we help each other. I trade successfully with 1minute 1 trade. The problem is I am in New York. Getting up at 2:30 am EST to trade is difficult while I also have a full time job. I can only trade once or twice a week now. When I stop working, in a month or two, I will be able to burn the midnight oil and trade daily. Sometimes we, (especially me at times) reach for something that not only is out of our reach, but also nonexistent. I’m sure it’s smarter to keep doing it the way I do and stop looking for rainbows. Thank you so much.

Hey Frank..  
  
Yes, I can understand your frustration..  
I have the same problem as I try to catch NY closes for my other method but I'm a hopeless case in the mornings lol ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
  
Your doing a great job and having success which is great!, keep up the good work your doing and I'm sure you'll be grinning big time 6-12months from now saying "who needs an EA, I'm da Guru!" ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

Bias at 7am was up but only marginally and likewise at 8am.   
Although Lo was broken after IFO news at 9am it returned back into the range within 3/4 bars so used the long signal on original bias (wouldn't have been surprised to see decent retrace as the down move after news missed large chunks of price prints ie Gaps). Trade did get to +4.4 pips net so if I had been trading it, may have considered exit at BE. Did the first 2 trades.

Hi Strada,  
  
Just curious, on the 8.12 no bias trade what SL did you use ?  
  
I am using 4 pips as generic stop for these trades.

Trading using the tight stops and looking to enter at the closing price of the signal bar, I'm going to assume most of you use market orders.   
One thing I can't seem to wrap my head around is when the signal bar closes I know that some of you wait to enter at the closing price but when price goes the opposite way you'll look for price to come back.  
  
What I'm wondering is what do you guys do when price shoots into the direction of the signal without looking back, do you just click the market order and a get a entry a little ways away?

**Ozmacca,** the TP was 6.6; SL was 2.2 (+spread)  
  
**Mannai** , sometimes price does 'shoot off' from the signal and this requires some quick finger response, it may cost a little bit but very often that can be recouped at exit so the TP amount is maintained, alternatively it will cost you a bit extra at SL unless the SL distance is retained in relation to the entry price.  
  
There are times when price will move so far away that entry is missed altogether, and unless price comes back to the signal price it's a trade missed. On this note if price reaches target or close and then comes back to the signal price I wouldn't then consider entry.  
  
This unfortunately is the cost of this part of my trading strategy, it doesn't have to be used, up to every individual. All I will say is that it saves alot of unnecessary losses. Take a look at Bill's chart above, 2 of the 3 signals had immediate reversals and this isn't unusual.  
  
**Honest Bill** , on your chart yesterday on your 2nd trade you mentioned 'bias slightly up', did you mean at London open, think everyone else had bias down for 8am.  
  
7am No Bias stopped out.

Frankfurt open, definitely down.  
London open slightly up, almost flat.

Yes, I thought the strategy had settled on that. But, I am doing the same as you trading regardless of Bias. So, I guess it does not matter.  
Are you just recording the Bias for your spreadsheets results comparison?

Hi Bill, recording all 4 trades to keep track of all the combos, currently trading the first 2 after 7am.   
For 8am I'm still using Paulus original setting for this including 2 hour bias and 1 hour bias for the 7am start.  
All the best, strada.

If anyone could provide some insight into the following that would be great.  
  
Considering the fact that this strategy is on the 1 min chart with very tight SL's and the reliance on very fast order execution with little to no slippage after the order is put in, I was wondering if anyone could recommend a broker.  
  
I would use the broker I use for my intra-day trading but the commissions would no doubt eat away at the profit of this strategy and take away the benefit of the RR. I have been reading on some spread-betting brokers such as Capital [Spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") but am skeptical since I have read that since they are market makers your order executions begin to slow down once your deals exceed a couple ₤/pip  
  
Any insight would be greatly appreciated.  
  
Thanks.  
  
Nice trades today Strada,  
How far do you let a trade travel before you consider a possible exit at BE?  
  
Thanks

Hey Mannai70..  
  
Only from my experience I have used Capital Spreads for a few years now and they have always been brilliant and of the only 2 discrepancies I had in those years they replaced my money and corrected the issue with no hassles..quick execution and very reliable ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Cheers,

Hi Mannai, exiting at BE isn't a straightforward decision as it depends largely on current/recent PA, ie is price bouncing off a recent barrier or creating new double/triple top/bottoms etc or if news imminent, etc. Also, if an earlier trade has made profit the decision then is do you preserve the profit you have or rsik a potential further profit or loss and let the trade ride to a conclusion. Personally I veer towards consolidation/protection.  
  
Re the SB's I can't imagine CS or 1G or C1ty or any of the big firms would slow you down at a couple of ££'s per pip, a couple of hundred maybe but only if you were placing trades of this size regularly and seldom losing, you'd certainly get flagged up then. They wouldn't stop you from trading but likely put you on dealer referral so they can cover, which in a hugely liquid market like EU might not cause much delay at all. The other thing SB's don't like are short term trades as again it doesn't always give them time to cover if they want to. What they won't tolerate is outright scalping especially if being done in large numbers, I don't think we fall into that category.  
If you stick with the large companies they will have much higher limits before any intervention sets in. The other thing to consider is that CS have several white label companies, mostly using the same platform style and pricing, (it's all done by CS), so you could open up accounts with them as well as CS and split your trades between them, I do it regularly using 2 of them and it works well. Helps if you have a mouse for each hand, you don't need to be ambidextrous, just make sure your clicking both at the same time. One advantage CS has over the others is when you place a trade your order box reappears immediately so you're set for any quick actions, and with this that is essential sometimes.  
strada.

Mannai,  
  
IG spread on EU is normally 0.8. I have been using them for 5 years now without issue. I have traded up to €20/per pip with them.  
  
I have also tested pending orders too of greater than €400. Somewhere above that it told me "Waiting for dealer desk", but then got accepted quickly enough. Those orders got deleted by me just as quick though ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Fantastic thread! Thanks to Paulus and Lana and Bill and Strada and others pushing and testing and tweaking this idea.  
  
I have read the whole thing and backtested and forward tested and settled on a set of rules based on Paulus and Strada.  
  
I ignore the bias and take the 1st 2 signals according the rules (MACD and STOCH) after the 7am candle close on the 5m chart. I use no bias because I cannot see bias doing anything as just as frequently as it moves in the direction of the bias it can also bounce back. I use the 5m chart because I have large spreads of 2-3p and find both the MACD and STOCH perform better with a little noise removed. I add in the longer STOCH from Strada (although the signal line only needs to be above or below 50) and I also add the Fast Stoch. So if MACD signals with reduction in histogram (ie dark green to green or dark red to red) AND ALL 3 STOCHS agree, then I watch PA and if it moves a little in my direction I enter using normal SL and TP rules.  
  
Anyway love all the work and hope to contribute to this thread from now on.

1st trade taken at +50minutes (0750hrs) with SL of 10p and TP of 35p. TP hit at +3hrs 20mins (1020hrs)  
2nd trade taken at +5hrs 50minutes (1250hrs) with SL of 10p and it reached TP1 of equal to SL so SL moved to BE. BE reached at 1320hrs)  
  
+15% for the day.  
  
btw I am in Brisbane Australia which is why the times on my charts are different. 

Winners add to winning trades!

I've been changing (or bending) the rules on a daily basis. Account is down 50% in just one week. I'll have to re-access, tighten up the rules or time to throw in the towel on this one.  
Ignore the "LONG ONLY" label in chart.

Marshalmax -  
  
Will you please simplify these into a bullet format or something? I'm trying to learn and I need it as simple as possible. Thanks for all your work on this strategy. I started reading the whole thread myself. I'm on page 20 and my scroll wheel on my mouse has started fighting me back...

Rules are still the same really. But, some have varied the rules. Stick with the original until you are familiar with it.

I’ve been folling your posts. Very informative. Thanks for sharing them. When you meet your bias, and open a trade, or a second trade, how long do you follow them? If they don't stop out or take profit?

Hi Frank, I don't have any time frame in mind but I keep my bearings with PA.  
Quite often the signals come after a strong move and the timing of the signal takes you into that area of congestion (distribution/accumulation) and it's difficult to see how long it will last and what the next direction will be. Often the breakout from that congestion range whether false or real will be enough to reach target.  
This morning's second trade (7am Bias) was quite a good example.  
Price dropped in line with the trade but it was hovering around the half way mark between recent Hi/Lo and on 3 attempts got only as far as +3 for the trade.  
Bearing in mind we're trading retracements, getting over the Fib 50 can be asking too much so i keep an eye on that, I don't use fibs on the charts, too much clutter but you get a reasonable idea just looking at the chart.  
Further, in my first trade I got 17% and as mentioned before I tend to be protective of gains already in the bank.  
After the third attempt of price going down it then created a series of 4 bars with higher hi's and Lo's so decided all things considered try to get out at close to BE. Closed at -1 which cost me 2.5%.  
The 8am Bias trade got to +4, if I'd been trading this one I would have considered exiting BE.

Hi Frank,  
Personally I would be thinking of closing at break even if it was taking too long. In today's trade you'll see there was a sharp move down and I didn't get to do that.  
  
With such a tight sl and tp the trades don't normally last too long, though.  
  
But, strictly Paulus' rules are to leave it on until tp or sl hit.

Hi Strada. I see that in the 8 AM NB you entered long in a green bar. I tought that even without bias you were entering aways long with red bars and shorts with green bars... no? Do you really enter longs with green bars and shorts with red bars?  
  
thanks in advance.

Hi GB, I'm still using Paulus original criteria for entry. The trade you referred to above was, (I think the 8am No Bias at 8.09am??), a short trade with stox previously over 80, MACD changed from green to dark green. I wondered if perhaps you'd confused the signal bar line with the 'London Open', otherwise I'm not sure what you mean, please come back to me if still in doubt. Regards.  
  
@ Paludo, the signal you mention although closed slightly below stox 80 would have probably been taken but price reversed away form the signal so no entry for me at that time. Hope this clarifies.  
  
Similar situation this morning with the 7am Bias trade. Signal at 7.25am but price reversed then another signal at 7.29am (coincidentally at exactly the same close price).  
  
Chart for today's trades and spreadsheet attached below.

entry is uncorect it seems  
stack was over 50 at the begining ofthe 1m candle  
  
for me its ok if its even over but only at the very end od the candle, not begining  
  
and Stop loss a 2 means 3 wit hspread  
but TP better if you use better ratio, why you only take 6 pips and a ratio 2 here?

No, it wouldn't be. If I multiplied the SL+spread by 3 I'd be looking for TP 9pips, TP6 has a much higher success rate so overall I prefer to keep the spread out of the calcs, it works for me. +67% this week, I don't think I need to improve on that.

Hi Strada,  
  
thanks for the stats you post on the forum.   
  
I would love to add something like this, but it was almost impossible to trade (on demo) over the last week.  
  
One question: based on your spreadsheet, and on one comment you did in this thread, you trade the first two signals, am i right?  
  
Thanks and nice weekend to everyone.

**hi****strada,**  
  
I have seen that you use very small SL.  
  
*)  
Do you place them when you enter a trade or execute them manually.  
  
If you place them at entry time: did you ever had the feeling of SL-hunting of your broker....  
  
*)  
would you be so kind to share with which broker you trade (if you don't mind me asking)  
  
Thanks a lot

are trading this the way strada trades it?  
  
if so, then so far this week looking at my charts I see:  
monday 1W 1L  
tuesday 2L  
wed 2W  
  
the first short signal the next candle retraces and when macd goes dark green again the stox is too low, finally when the macd goes dark green again the stox is good and therefore the signal is good. Also, don't forget about the no bias long that shows a good signal.

hi,  
are you trying improving hte technique by catching more trades possible hte morning session?  
  
there is maybe a great work of research to do about that. when the market is calm . from 5 an to 8 am london time and from 10 pm to 1 am, the evening.  
  
if anyone will have courage to start work and statistics , or to share the work by diving the research results from different hours...  
  
i know that some professional traders use the retracement from stockastisque simply, on M1, with bollinger the night . and good results.  
  
good research , enjoy the work and proud to make your own research and improvment

if you use a Stop Loss hard, from 3 to 6. with a ratio 3, you will see lot of different results.  
  
what i can say to you is that in september i was negative with a SL 5  
  
i am working research to see how the retracement can be improved, and make a SL from 3 to 6 regarding the last highest level of the day  
  
there is something very good into that. THis style will make a much better result thant a code EA defined ! SO fantastic

Live. I use IG Index where I can get a 0.8 spread. They don't do demo.

Sorry to reply to all in a quick post, but, I'm not as nimble as strada with the typing.  
  
Mannai,  
A combination of Strada and Paulus. I manually backtested several months until my eyes were bleary and came up with the attached**. During the backtesting I did hit one run of 10 losses too. I broke the current loss run today and will post later.  
  
Atlante,  
I won't say I am trying to improve the strategy, but rather adding some rules for myself which keep me disciplined (and hopefully filter out a few false signals). Go back through the thread. Strada posted results in a spreadsheet.  
Also, I normally only use a few moving averages and sometimes the RSI. This strategy uses Stoch and MACD, So, I won't be adding any more and I never use EA's. All manual.  
  
I was using the last swing hi/lo for stop loss which meant 5 or more pips. So, now I try to get in like Strada for 3 sl and 6 tp. I know the ratio is only 1:2, but most times 1:3 or 9 pips never seems to be hit.  
  
  
**Note: While I am live trading I have not decided if this is a long term strategy for me yet, so perhaps stick to Paulus or Strada's rules. I am giving this until end October. So, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, don't ask lots of questions until then.

hi guys, I just joined the thread. I'm seeking for advice and opinion regarding placing the SL. I was trying with MT4 just now, and the 1.8pips spread is killing the ratio. I was trying with strada SL2 TP6. The spread hence turned it into SL3.8 TP7.8 (instead of 1:3, now its 1:2, risk reward ratio has been deteriorated).   
  
I just signed up for Capital Spread Betting. Here's the question.  
1) For those using MT4 trading, how do you place your trade? how many pips in actual for SL and TP?  
2) For those spreadbetting, did you enter the trade once the MT4 has hit the signal line?   
  
Thanks all. Its a great concept, hope can benefit from it. Enjoy ur weekend.

2) Yes. MT4 for charts only  
  
I had been using MT4 demo, but moved over to live spreadbetting for a tighter spread. Makes it real too.

Using 2 pips SL (1 pip spread + 1 pip TP) and taking the 2 first trades this week:  
  
Monday:  
  
6:13 Buy, NB. Probaly loss because price went at least -1 pip before +6  
6:48 bias. Loss. Price went -3.8  
  
Tuesday:  
  
6:29 Loss NB and bias(maybe the first trade was 6:00 wich was a loss too)  
07:00 NB loss  
  
Wednesday:  
  
6:04 NB loss. Maybe not using criteria of wait price to goes in trade direction  
6:33 price went bellow the line but came back quickly. Difficult to say because price went 1.3 pip before goes up. Most probably a loss.  
  
7:15 if 6:04 was not taken than maybe this one was a trade to take and it was a loss.  
  
Thursday:  
  
6:06 NB loss  
6:39 bias win  
  
Today  
  
6:04 bias: loss  
7:12 maybe a win, but price went 0.8 against the trade  
  
I am not trading this so i am not 100% sure

Just did a small backtest using LadyOfFame strategy (add a Stoch 55,15,15 to confirm the trade) and the results are good. Obviously, backtesting is not the same as trading and some trades were very late in the session but might worth to try:  
  
With RR 2:1  
LWWWWWWWWLW  
  
With 3:1  
LWWWWLWWWLL

What was your entry criteria when you backtested?

Hi,   
  
The entry criteria is the same described here (Paulus method) but adding the extra stoch. So it means, enter after London open, BIAS 2h previous london open.

Here below is mine from Friday: (you need the 28, 62, 200 EMA's)

unless you have consistent results on the 5min for a good few months then nothing doin iam afraid.
