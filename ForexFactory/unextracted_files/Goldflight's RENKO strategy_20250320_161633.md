Hello all,  
Here is another renko system i have been working on for a couple of weeks now. I have changed it a number of times till i came up with a simple system that seems to work very well. There is plenty of room for improvement, so any input would be appreciated.  
First of all, I dont remember where i got all of the indies and the ea for this, or who programed them. But i would like to thank them for there hard work.  
  
\------------------ NEW SET UP ON POST 351. FOLDER ON POST 356-----------------------------  
  
  
Here is what you need.  
5 block renko chart  
10 ema (blue)  
20 ema (red)  
PJ- Over rsi 7-50-50  
PJ- Over rsi 14-50-50  
Pivot points on 1 min chart  
FIBS on 1 min chart  
(Optional) trail stop EA  
  
Long- Block closes above 10 ema, 10 ema above 20 ema, PJ rsi 7 and 14 green.  
Short- Blocks closes below 10 ema, 10 ema below 20 ema, PJ rsi 7 and 14 red  
  
I have the trailing ea on the 1 min chart set at 15 pip s/l, 100 pip t/p, 15 pip trail stop, move to break even 15 pips, and 2 pip lock.  
  
I hope you see potential in this system as i do.  
  
Happy pipping.

Looks like a great little system, Do you use any higer renko blocks or any timeframe charts to confirm the trend or are you just scalping?  
  
  
looking forward to trying it.  
  
thanks

Myself i like the 5 pip block so i havent tried a higher block.  
I do look at a higher tf to get an idea of trend, and check on pp, and fibs.

Yes as with all systems, some days are good and some are not.  
Very important to watch PP's.

Did you use 5 pip box size for AUDJPY and EURJPY? Also what was your trailing stop? Thanks

_hi alelimian,  
  
I opened up AUDJPY, CADJPY, CHFJPY, GBPJPY and USDJPY with 5 pip renko box.  
  
I did not place the trade until all 5 pairs confirmed to due so.  
  
It's not perfect and it's still a work in progress

Trying something new. I removed the 10 and 20 ema's and replaced them with a 14 SMOOTHED high / low chanel. ( Golden chanel)   
I have found that most of the time when the blocks pass through the chanel, some pips can be gotten. NOT ALWAYS. But more times than not.  
I havent had much time to do much of a back test. So give it a try and see what you think.

Hi et,  
You have to put it on the one min chart then goto file, open offline chart, go too m2 of the pair you have chosen then open. you must keep 1 min chart running because it feeds m2 offline chart.

Thanks for the alert indicator i'll give it a try.  
  
I also found a way to help with watching a potential trade, you can use constant range bars along side the renko bars and that should help clarify the trade before you take it.

Nice uncomplicated setup.  
  
These days it is better to stay out of live trades with all the news coming up towards NFP Friday, so will experiment a bit with this setup.

Playing with some setups at the moment, but the market barely moves at this hour, so not much to test.

Hi Goldflight, sorry for my english...I'm going to try your system and I need more explanation please. I'd like to know where you enter exactly ( when the bar is formed in the golden channel or the previous bar, or...) and the SL   
It look like a great system with very low risk  
thank you in advance

open the chart, right click,open properties, in common choose candlesticks, in color the color in bar up and bar down same color of background...check if bill and bear bar have NOT the same color of background  
  
example   
background black  
bar up black  
bar down black  
bull candle lime  
bear candle red  
  
put the indicators and save the template like renko.tpl or what you want

Sorry to hear that.  
  
Getting older is one thing, but then the pills that need to be swallowed daily to keep blood pressure and other stuff on certain levels.

Goldflight.  
  
Please get in touch with me which ever way fits you.  
  
  
and to the other trader:  
RENKO and Range Bars are the same on my charts, the last one is marketed by a cheater that promises you the world, but NEVER pays his commissions.

Freddy, the reason why is that some trader that post forums post updated templates and indicators and change the rules from their original post. I saw post#35 but the rules are a little vague.  
That's why i am questioning just to make sure.

It did with the last one I loaded.  
You may have forgotten to load into the navigator-indicator folder, sometimes happens to me.   
Not sure why he has that on the chart, as it belongs to a completely different strategy that runs on M15, but let the man himself elaborate on that.  
  
Also to me the colors are not the nicest one to look at with my baby blue eyes, ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
  
That is anyhow not of the most importance, although you should stay aware the stress on the eyes and the right coloring does have an impact at the end of some hours watching charts.  
  
The FFCal indi that shows you the upcoming news could use a lighter color in the vertical version, without having any effect on the original strategy.

NP, amigo.  
If you loaded his last 2 TPL's you would have noticed the rules are printed in the top left corner of the chart automatically. They are 2 independent lines and the second one even has a little "mistake" in it.  
Wonder which keen observer did notice that. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/270c-fe0f.png?v=15.1)  
  
Only the part about the ADX rules does not get mentioned, but that is easy to add yourself to the text lines, if wanted/needed.  
  
I have a problem at times, guys.  
As a teacher and mentor I demand from my students that they have done the courses of their broker on how to manage their MT4 platform, otherwise I am not even willing to accept their tuition fee for my training.

Hi Goldflight,  
  
I use similar trading system as you have but with smaller value of Renko (2pips and 5 pips).   
  
I'd like to ask you if you could post some print screens where is clearly showed (e.g. by vertical lines) your entry.  
  
Thank you very much for your effort.

Doing the same in my setups.  
Guess his reason for choosing that brick size is to find safer entries.  
  
Matter is, you leave a lot of nice pips on the table.

Hi Goldflight,  
  
Since you're using 10 pip bars, if at the time of your trading start if you are already in a trend run, how do you re-enter it? Do you wait for a pullback, given that it could be a long wait!  
  
Also, do you find a 15 pip sl too tight, since a 10 pip renko will potentially move a max of nearly 30 pips to show a bar in the other direction.  
  
Thanks

Yes, wait for a pullback and see if indies are still giving signal to go.  
  
I use a s/l of 30 pips to allow for price movement.

Hello Goldflight,  
  
Thank you very much for posting your Renko strategy and variations here. I have been working around Heiken Ashi and Renko in recent times to tweak my style as I feel they offer very clear signals.  
  
I have been running the version you put up in post #35 (the one with the Heiken Ashi) and am up 375 pips so far this evening across a few of the major pairs. I am pretty pumped about this! The couple of extra indicators you added in addition to the Heiken Ashi and Renko have really made a difference.  
  
Just wanted to say THANKS and may many pips come your way! I plan to lurk in this thread and post my trades as I go. I hope others will join in and carry on working with what is a great system.  
  
Let's go snare some pips!

Hello Ezakimak.  
Thank you for your kind words. I am glad this is working for you. Here is my trades for today. I only traded GBPUSD today for a profit of +142. Tired now so i will be back tommorow.  
  
  
  
Good pipping to all.

Hi guys,  
  
Hope you had a good day wherever you are. Melbourne could not decide whether it wanted to rain or shine today!  
  
I have one eye on the AUDUSD 1H chart at the moment. Waiting for 7pm to roll around to see if we are gonna jump in. Looks good at the moment....

Okay, the set up I posted before was still looking good at 7pm so I kicked off a trade:  
  
AUDUSD  
  
Entry: 0.89988  
  
Currently 80 pips in the positive. Stop Loss has been moved to lock in a couple of pips so no matter what happens now, this will be a winner! Put on a Trailing Stop of 75 pips, lets see how we go!

Alrighty, AUDUSD trade update:  
  
AUDUSD  
  
Trade closed at 0.90001  
  
Profit: +14  
  
This was as high as 95 in profit, had it got to 100 probably would have stopped it manually there, but since I had a Trailing Stop, I thought I would let it run.  
  
Happy to snaffle 14 pips!  
  
Most of the other majors are showing promising signs....watch this space....

Hello team,  
  
Just closed a trade on USDCHF with this system with 34 pips profit. Am a bit gutted about this one, it went as far as 220 pips into profit, but my wife was using the laptop and my Trailing Stop didn't start for some reason, I only got small bite of the pie! Never mind, some pips is better than no pips!  
  
Up 48 pips for the night and now some good setups taking shape on EURUSD, USDJPY and even the USDCAD might be resuming the downtrend it has been in for a while.

Those three pairs I mentioned before all looked good at the turn of the hour so I have set off the trades as follows:  
  
USDCAD sold @ 1.02672  
EURUSD bought @ 1.28368  
USDJPY sold @ 85.568  
  
As I type this, they are all in the positive. Let's see how we go....

Hi Goldflight, have you thought about adding an alert to the ADX?  
I've searched the the FF threads and looked at a lot of ADX indicators that they added alerts to but none seem to work correctly.  
  
It would be nice to not have to watch the charts 24X5 waiting for a setup.  
  
thanks for all the great work

Seems you use a 5-digit-broker... So all in all your real proft is only 19,7 Pip???

Right, this 5 decimal stuff from these bucketshop brokers is only meant to sucker in more victims to believe forex is an easy goldmine.

That's right, I have a micro account with my broker with which you can trade with lots as small one cent if that is what you want to do. Great way to learn the ropes while not risking too much money.

If you are looking for an alert indi, you can put on this coral indi. It gives an alert when it crosses and it is about the same time as ADX 14 crosses.

1\. Yes i trade off the M3 chart.  
  
2.Yes, Looking at higher time frame will give you the direction of main trend. But my system will get you pips in counter trend.  
  
3\. TDI GREEN above RED look for buy when ADX GREEN above RED. TDI GREEN below RED look for sell when ADX RED ABOVE GREEN.  
  
4\. My stoploss is 30 pips.  
  
DISREGARD MAGENTA LINES IN MY SCREENSHOTS, THEY ARE FOR A DIFFERENT STRATEGY.

If you are using a 5 digit broker (i do), You must add a zero to box size on renko block indicator. ( Example, 10 pip block type in 100). For 4 digit broker just type in 10 for box size.

Hi guys,  
  
Friday night in Melbourne, and what am I doing? TRADING. Ha ha! Its too cold to be outside anyway...  
  
Set off a BUY on the USDCHF earlier on this evening, got in at 1.03611 and closed it with 150 pips profit. Put my trust in the system and traded $1 pips so a very nice way to finish the week. Decided to close as I am going to bed and don't want any trades open over the weekend.  
  
THANKS GOLDFLIGHT. I owe you an icy cold beer.

Hi guibernaua. Normaly i start my day at the British open. But i had a Dr appointment to have a bunch of tests, So i decided to sleep in and not trade Thursday. But you are right, GU and EU would have each been losers then big winners. EJ would have been bad day to trade. Here are two rules i personally follow.  
  
1\. When i have a losing trade, i double my lot size on the next trade.  
  
2.If i have 2 losing trades in a row, i stop trading that pair for the day.  
  
So you see, GU and EU would have worked out great, and EJ would have had 2 losers in a row and i would have stopped trading it.  
  
Remember this is not the holy grail. There is no holy grail. You are going to have good days and bad days.   
  
Happy pipping........

Hi Goldflight, I've been working on your system trying to get it just right for my strategy.  
I am using 13pip blocks and that seems to take the chop out, I removed traders sentiment and added an indicator that shows all the timeframes and the direction.  
  
I look for trades (adx cross and t/f all same direction)1 hour prior to US, London, Asia market open  
  
Last night was +119 on GBPJPY  
  
thanks again!!

Hi GoldFlight,  
  
I have been using the Heiken Ashi template you posted on a 1 hour chart as I was having real trouble getting the renko to work on a M2 / M3 chart. It was working with modest success as I have posted.  
  
Somehow last night I finally worked out how to get the Renko on the main screen and so tonight after work will give it a go with the Heiken Ashi template on a M3 screen and with the box size set with an extra zero (as I have a 5 digit broker).  
  
One question, with the Heiken Ashi strategy, what role does the Renko play? For a BUY, are you just looking for the Renko to be above the Heiken Ashi before confirming with the other indicators? Opposite for a SELL?  
  
Just wondering as it seems you could trade this without the Renko and just use the Heiken Ashi and other indicators. I love the way this works and provides a nice clear signal. I love the Golden Channel too. Nice and simple - like me!  
  
Thanks again! Have a great day.  
  
Ezakimak

Greetings all. This looks like a great system   
Got this all working on my charts except for the MACD MA1 and MA5. I just keep getting standard MACD without the two moving averages. Please let me know what I'm missing? 

Just trade the pullback you idiot!

I like the renko because it gives me a nice clean chart. I look for color change on HA. Then conformation on other indies.

Pull up navigator window, click on indicators (NOT CUSTOM INDICATORS),  
  
Left click and hold on moving averages and drag to MACD.  
  
enter 1EMA white, click on apply to, scroll down to FIRST INDICATOR DATA, click OK.  
  
Do same for 3 EMA red.

Goldflight, i also forgot to tell you that once the ADX cross happens and the timeframes line up i am placing a pending order 10 pips higher or lower to verify that the adx cross signals does what it is supposed to do.  
  
My method is still a workin progress.

that is clear to me, but i want to ask, is there is any rule you set your TP? like you watch the pivot lines, or you close the trade on the first opposite candle?  
And another question i have is this - when i look to your graphs, i see, that you enter the trady not on the end of the candle, how do you do this exactly?  
THX for this system

Sorry Hankeys, i misunderstood your question. I realy dont have a rule for exits. Sometimes i exit on reversal of opposite candle if it had a good long run, and somtimes i just wait to see if it will come back and hit trail stop. Most of the time i kind of go by what i feel. Sometimes i am right and sometimes i am wrong.  
  
On my charts the blue line is on the candle i took the trade (trade was taken at the opening of the candle with blue line). The close of the prior candle gave me the signal.   
  
I hope this helps.  
  
Happy pipping...........

Hello Goldflight,  
How's it going?  
As you know I'm an old renko scalper fan, thanks for starting your thread.  
I'm starting to test a similar setup to your post #1, along side a few indis borrowed from the RTFG thread. I'll let you all know how it goes.

Why not post something so interested people can pitch in?  
  
Meanwhile I have a question for you:  
So far I have only been able to setup one Renko size on a specific pair.  
Is there a way I can test another Renko brick setting on the same pair and on the same platform?

Hi Freddy, you might try playing the coral settings, i have been using coral with setting of 6 and adx setting of 8 and dmi setting of 13 plus i added a 197 exponential moving average to keep me on the right side of the trend.  
  
it helps a little but i still am struggling to get it right, someday i will get it hahahhaa

Hi Freddyfx,  
Guess your question was for me.  
I posted quite a few renko setups in the RTFG thread already, so I'm not really in a hurry to post something until I'm sure it works well. i.e. better than 50% winners.  
You can use one of the renko ea chart makers that was converted to an indi to make about as many offline renko charts as you like from a single one min chart.  
Here's a renko range bar version for example.

Guess I am still doing something wrong.  
  
So far I noticed that if I have 2 M2 charts of the same pair, one of the charts does not automatically update.  
I use the EA s-Renko bars to create the M1 chart.  
  
When I change the M1 chart setting to different brick size, the original one also changes.  
  
So far I have solved that problem by opening another acct. and have the different Renko brick size on that one.  
If there is an easier way, sure would like to learn.

Open a M1 Chart... attached Renko Script ( ie:Eur/Usd RenkoBox Size 10 ,RenkoTimeFrame 2) then open offline M2 chart.  
Open another M1 chart of EUR/USD, attached Renko Script with (for example) RenkBox Size 20, RenkTimeFrame 5, open offline M5 chart.

SUPERB, buddy.  
I changed the settings to yours and can only report that is looks like a better setup to take a trade decision on.  
**coral** **6** and **ADX 8** and **TDI 13**   
  
the **EMA197** is not really doing it for me, Goldflight's earlier setup using the **SMA14** levels give me a better indication.  
  
I will keep experimenting with this for now and await a more active EU market.  
  
Thanks for the input.

If you use the indi version, you can attach as many as 4 or 5 renko ind chart makers to the single one min chart, just have to give each on a different offlne chart number to use that isn't a default MT4 timefame.  
  
To make it easier to remember which is which, I sometimes open a 4 pip chart on 4M timeframe which MT4 doesn't use.  
Open a 8 pip renko chart on 8Min offline time frame...  
14 on 14 etc...  
Don't think I'd try to open any on 5Min since MT4 uses that one so it may actually overwrite your 5 min candles sticks, but if your not using the 5 min time frame guess it shouldn't hurt anything, but only time I'd do that if I was trying to generate renkobars in the backtester but is up to you.  
  
I don't like to script version for everyday use, because I think it will fall off the one min chart every-time you restart MT4.

Hi Goldflight, I experimented this morning with NFP trading I have to say i did pretty well.  
I used 4renko, 8renko, 8renko and a 1 minute chart.  
I added an ADX, DMI the coral indicator and a 197 exp. MA  
i took about 90 pips in less than 5 mintues once i saw it retrace i got a little shakey and took my profits early, I only gave up 10-15pips.  
  
I just with the renko bar was a true bar of 4 or 8 or 16 pips  
  
happy pips!  
  
sorry about not posting the picture but the size was too big, i attached it another way.

This may help you too, someone posted step-by-step instructions in the RTFG thread. Also contains very specific instructions for setting up Mihailo's soybean trading system, but you can skip these parts of it if you want to.

Thanks for the warm welcome Goldflight.  
I was testing some setups off 30 pip & higher renko range bars but they can be a challenge when market starts ranging for long periods of time, and since renko bars are all price movements as you know then the psychological advantage of using renko bars is lost on me. On Saturdays I usually test indicators or a variety of setups in a MT4 simulator, & usually have impressive results on timed candle sticks. The sim practice is carrying over well into my forward test results, but realistically I have to wonder how much money do you think someone really needs to day trade live FX etc to make a comfortable living in the US?  
Isn't capital gain tax 50%?  
So I'd probably need to double $100k to clear a $50K a year salary right?  
Compared to the cost of starting a small business in the US, that really isn't too bad.  
  
PS:  
Is that a standard ADX seen in your latest screen shots?

Hi all  
  
Just wondering if anybody is still trading this system and how its going? Ive been busy with this system the whole week and its been going OK. Trying to filter some trades but as always the market does what the markets want. Im convinced its better to just pay attention to support and resistance and if all seems ok to trade. Any advice will be appreciated.

Yes.  
  
Working fine, just stick to the rules.  
  
If the market is not showing a trade, then there is no trade.

Thanks Freddy! If you are still using it is must be worth it ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
I'm a big fan of renko charts-to me they just make sense! If you dont mind me asking do you trade every signal (like a scalpter with tight stops) or do you filter your trades? And if you do filter what do you use. My reason for asking: I cant decide to keep filtering and trying to save myself from losers and in the process missing a few profitable trades.   
  
Dank U!

Still here valpre. Like Freddy said, you must be patient. Also having knowledge of price action will help in making decisions.

Thanks Goldflight!  
  
How are you feeling?  
  
So you also filter your trades? I usually only buy or sell according to my interpretation of the longer term trend but as I said it also makes you miss a few good ones. So im wondering if its better to just scalp your system, in other words setting your stop to BE after a few pips. And taking a few BE but when the big ones come riding them all the way. I scalp THV on the M1 chart and using the above mentioned method works for me.   
  
What do you think?

Feeling better thank you.  
  
Yes i have been going with the trend and have been experimenting with 5 pip block. I find the 5 pip block works good for scalping in counter trends. (screen shots are 10 pip blocks)  
  
I use a trailing EA that i set too move to break even +1 pip after 20 pips. Then a 25 pip trail stop. ( EA is on 1st post)........

Glad you're feeling better!  
  
Im also finding the 5 pip blocks good for scalping with a trade manager managing the stops. Thanks for the advice.

Hallo Astom  
  
1- Open 1 Minute chart of the currency pair you wish to trade eg GBPUSD  
2- Attach RenkoLiveChart_v2.1 to it  
3- Go to FILE and select OPEN OFFLINE  
4- Select the M3 chart of the M1 chart you attached RenkoLiveChart_v2.1 to eg GBPUSD  
5- On the offline M3 chart right click and select Template and select Goldflights HA Smoothed  
6- Trade and make lots of pips  
  
_**Remember**_ that M1 chart you opened and attached RenkoLiveChart_v2.1 too must stay open for your offline chart to work.   
  
Hope that helps.

Goldflight,  
Congrats on your setup, although I still haven't forwarded tested it much yet, I think it is very good if not better than most other Renko setups I've seen thus far.  
Here's a short trade on ey this morning, wasn't home to keep an eye on it so set a tight 15 pts trailing stop loss on it but in retrospect I see it would have went all the way for 50+ pips tp that I originally set just above the woody pivot, stop loss wasn't quite 1:1 but I had set it just above the R1 line which it was in no danger of being hit in this trade.  
Thanks for sharing it...  
PS: These are 10 pip renko range bars, not your usual renko bars by the way.  
Goldflight, also check out this short signal on Gold this morning we missed...

Hi Goldflight,  
  
I have recently started using Renko and I have absolutely fallen in love with them!  
  
I have looked over your system using them and it seems as if you are on to something here.  
  
Now I am not a Renko afficianado or anything but I have done some research. And based on my findings I have come across a piece of information that I believe is worth looking into regarding exits.  
  
Renko charts are part of a family called Reversal Charts. In their purest form no indicators are used and signals for long/short are generated by what you see on the chart. Now I am not recommending removing indicators becuase I do believe there is some value in doing a little optimizing fo rentries to help reduce whipsaws. But this information points to exiting trades on the sign of a reverse signal.  
  
Have you done any eyeballing or actual investigation into using this type of an exit strategy with your system?  
  
I am still reading up on these types of sharts to learn more but believe there is true value in this charting method.  
  
Nice trades by the way ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
  
Cheers,  
Trader V

Hi TraderV,  
  
Good question. To be honest with you, exits are one of my downfalls. I always seem to exit too early or too late.   
  
As i have stated in an earlier post, i will exit either on first reversal block or let my trail stop hit. Lately i have been using a 25 pip t/s so im usualy stoped out on first reversal block anyway. Then i wait for next setup.

Agreed, exits are always the toughest to master. Your method of a trailing stop of 20 pips (sie you are using 10 pip RB) seems to be right in line with when a reversal bar would setup. The only problem I can see with this is that a TS of 20 could get taken out prematurely as the market moves lower but not quite low enough to form a reversal bar then heads higher and prints a new high.  
  
On my charts I have the renko print with wicks so I can see where price as gone. I like to see these things. Even though I am trading based on the close of the bar and sudsequently a formation which forms my trigger.  
  
I am still reading and discovering some infomation about these charts and how they were originally used. If I happen to come across some additional helpful information I iwll be glad to post it.  
  
I don't want to post up my charts just yet as they differfrom yours and don't want to confuse anyone following your stuff here.  
  
Cheers,  
Trader V

This was the results of 10 pip block. I was trying AC but was getting too many false signals.  
  
Here is what i am using,  
  
10 pip RENKO block chart  
  
MACD (12-26-9)  
  
1 EMA (white) on MACD  
  
3 EMA (red) on MACD  
  
AWESOME Indicator (Bill Williams)  
  
ADX 10 with 50 level line  
  
HA Smoothed Indicator  
  
RULES.  
  
HA green- 1 EMA crosses above 3 EMA- AO green- ADX +DI crosses above 50 level- BUY  
  
HA white- 1 EMA crosses below 3 EMA- AO red- ADX -DI crosses above 50 level- SELL  
  
I have removed the TDI indi and changed the ADX to 10. Also trying ADX cross alert. (red and blue dots on screen shot)

For now i am just looking at EURUSD - GBPUSD - USDCAD - EURJPY. I find it difficult to try and watch more right now. Been trying ADX cross alert indi to help me (hopefully) watch more pairs.

Ah the joy of having a computer, my charts crashed this morning, so i had to reinstall my MT4. now as you can see my charts go from July 19 to this morning. so there will be no trades today.   
  
So if anyone out there is trading using this system, please post your trades. I would like to see how everyone else is doing.  
  
Thank you all, and happy pipping....

Thanks mate!  
  
I got stopped out on this one (for profit so its all good) but if I had been able to stay in I would have snared much more as it has kept on falling.  
  
This is a nice sound strategy. I would recommend this for newbies starting out. If they can figure out how to set up the chart they will be on to a winner!  
  
Goldflight, which pair have you had the most success with? Are they all about the same or is there one that really stands out?

You are very welcome Ezakimak.  
  
I think the pairs i have had the best luck with has been EURUSD and GBPUSD. Neither really stand out, but there [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") are low and they move well.   
  
Happy pipping..................

What do you think of an ADX crossing indi (with alert)? Or did you already try one?

I tried the ADX crossing alert but found that it was not accurate. I dont know if it was because it was affected by the offline chart or not. So still looking.

Goldflight,  
  
Have you tried the 5 pip Renko box and if so, how where your results? Anyone else try this?  
  
Thanks,

Hi sdcindy,  
  
Yes i tried 5 pip, but seemed to get to many false signals so i try to stick with 10 pip. Seems to work the best.

Heres a little something for scalpers to try.  
  
3 pip renko chart  
  
HA Smoothed  
  
MACD (12-26-9)  
  
Awsome indi  
  
Pipholic SR indi  
  
1 EMA (white) on the MACD  
  
3 EMA (red) on MACD  
  
RULES--BUY  
  
1 EMA crosses above 3 EMA-- HA turns green--AO turns green-- 3 pip block closes above pipholic SR-- BUY...  
  
SELL  
  
1 EMA crosses below 3 EMA-- HA turns red-- AO turns red-- 3 pip block closes below pipholic SR-- SELL...  
  
As soon as you buy or sell, pull up your close window and close at first sign of reversal.

Hi Goldflight, I'm still working with your system but the market is so slow it's hard to test.  
  
GU has been killing me all week with it's whipsaws.  
  
I've been using 6,10,16 renko's and bouncing ideas off the wall.

I am using these indicators and scripts along with your ADX cross alert. When ADX alert comes, and other indicators is correct i put sell or buy STOP order, with these two scripts and put New Candle Alarm on the graph. When new candle appears i hear the alert and know, if the STOP order is hit, or the candle go to the other side.

I checked this system a few times and kept dismissing it..just on glance as not right for me. I have had success with a couple things on renko and crb so I added them and found your system really nice Goldflight. Very much appreciated.   
  
All the best

Hey Goldflight thanks for good system...  
i have one idea about eliminating bad signals...i put trend magic indicator and it looks much better...what do you think?  
buy with goldflight's trading rules and only when trend magic is blue and renko bar is above trend magic line...opposite for sell

Updated pic attached.  
  
Fansimple shows a series of MA's and where price is  
in relation to them on different time frames and also  
the angle of the MA"s if strong enough.  
  
Stochastic RSI is great.. especially on renko and crb...  
must be clearly above 80 for long or clearly below 20  
for a short.  
  
Delta from the Renko for Gamers thread....nice extra  
confirmation is separation in the direction of play  
  
Digistoch shows trend of stoch on different time frames  
  
GMACD shows guppy macd trend on multiple time frame  
  
Anything you want me to post I missed, let me know.  
  
To a great week trading!  
  
Brian

Brian,  
  
As a sidebar, I notice you have indicators from forex-trading-coaches. What did you think of them? I am considering trying their trade room.

Hi Golden, thanks for the indicators and the info, just to confirm you are using 16 renko? Also are their any special settings on indicators?

I use 10 renko for all pairs.. with this setup I feel there is plenty  
of filtering. If I could do 5 tic reliably I would, but I feel comfortable  
doing 10 with this.  
  
No not really, I use the standard settings in these indicators  
in general.. fansimple I select do not show fan and change the  
color of some settings as shown on my screen to match what  
my eye is looking for long/short.  
  
So basically just changing a couple of them for color  
support but they are otherwise great as is.  
  
Really important stochastic rsi fully above or below level  
along with adx above 50 when you enter and best (but not  
absolutely necessary) if delta is clearly agreeing with your trade direction at that time.  
  
All the best  
  
Brian

may i have a question? is there any EA which can move my SL every new candle appears about x pips.   
for example. i have set my SL to 22 (EURUSD - spread 2, renko 10). so i am telling that one opposite candle is my SL. and i want some EA, which can move this SL every new candle appears with 10 pips less - to -12  
so candle 1 - SL -22  
candle 2 - SL -12  
candle 3 - SL -2  
candle 4 - SL +8  
and so on  
so when opposite candle appears - end of trade.

Why make it easy to trade when you can make it a Xmas tree and make it more complicated?!

Trying something new. I put the 1 and 3 EMA's on the AO, and removed the MACD. Same rules.

Hello Goldflight -- hope you are well.   
  
In a humble attempt to repay you for your great system, I have put together the attached indicator that combines the various indicator signals that you use (plus one that I added) and produces a combined signal that can trigger an audible alert as well as an email alert. Here are some notes:  
  
1\. From the Parameters Input box, turn on each indicator one at a time and convince yourself that it is working properly.  
2\. Enable any combination of indicators by setting the desired ones to 'true'. The resulting signal is the logical union of the selected indicators. The following indicators can be enabled for signal:  
a. AO_Filter_Enable -- when AO is green, this signals long; when AO is red, it signals short.  
b. ADX_Filter_Enable -- I have added an 'DIthreshold' parameter. Set it to 50.0 to get your recommended minimum value for ADX. Personally, I have been experimenting with 40.0, which gets you in a bar earlier sometimes. For a long signal, +DI must be greater than +DI on the bar before, and +DI must be greater than 'DIthreshold'.  
c. HAsmoothed_Filter_Enable -- this is a simple Heiken Ashi Smoothed filter. If the smoothed HA candle is green, the signal is long. If the smoothed HA candle is white, the signal is short.  
d. MACD_Filter_Enable -- this is an MACD filter. If the current MACD bar is longer than the bar before it, the signal is long. If the current MACD bar is shorter than the bar before it, the signal is short.  
e. ITL_Filter_Enable -- I added an 'Instantaneous Trendline" filter. The indicator is attached. It is a good indicator out of John Ehlers book "Cybernetic Analysis for Stocks and Futures", and it filters out a few loosers. If the trigger is above the instantaneous, signal is long, below, short.  
f. AlertsEnable -- set this to true to get an audible alert.  
g. EmailAlert -- set this to true to get an email alert. Note that AlertsEnable must be true for this to work, and yyour must have your MT4 configured properly for email.  
3\. I was unable to include your 1 EMA and 3 EMA in the AO indicator box. You use the AO data to produce these EMA lines, and I am unable to figure out how to sense these values in the AO indicator box from MQl language. However, I do not think it matters must, since the EMA lines give the same signal as the AO.  
  
That is it. Hope this works for you, and allows you to trade more pairs.

Welcome Slack, I determined my S/L by what i am willing to lose. I have been experimenting with the amount , so at times you will see different size S/L on my chart. But i think 30 pip S/L is good.

Here are the rules,  
  
AO turns green--- 1 EMA (on AO) crosses above 3 EMA (on AO) --- ADX 10 green crosses above red--- BUY.  
  
AO turns orange--- 1 EMA (on AO) crosses below 3 EMA (on AO)--- ADX 10 red crosses above green--- SELL.  
  
These are what you want to watch for Higher highs/higher lows---Lower highs/lower lows--- Support and Resistance--- The 1 and 3 EMA's--- AO color--- ADX--- Trend--- news.  
  
I hope this helps. Happy pipping.............

Renko is an indicator, put it in indicator folder-- then put it on a 1 min chart (if you have a 5 digit broker you must add a zero to block size)-- go to file, open offline m2 of chosen pair-- I have also put a 1 min template in the zip folder. this will help.

Yes, Renko charts are offline charts. remember you haave to keep 1 min chart running also because it feeds offline chart. you can trade off the offline chart just like regular charts. Hope this helps?

Goldflight, hope things are going well for you. I do not see the trailing stop EA on your recent chart posts. How are you managing your trades these days? I have a trade management EA that I frequently use, but I cannot seem to get it to work on the Renko chart. Will EA's not work on Renko charts?  
  
Thanks for your continuing help.

I will keep having a play round see if I can figure it out im sure its something simple.

Hi Goldflight, thanks again, this is a great profitable trading system.  
  
But, one ask, Why do you changed your timeframe strategy, M3 to M2? I would like understand which more indicated? I'm using M3 and work well, but same without know why, i'll go change to M2 too. hehe.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

EAs most certainly work on offline charts. The indicator/script/EA that creates the offline chart needs a few extra lines of code to enable this functionality. Check with the author of your Renko script to enable this functionality.

Hi goldflight,  
  
thank you very much for sharing your new setup. How long do you trade it and how are your results overall?   
Maybe we can launch a chat for people who are trading your system (for discussing some trades or signals every day). That´s my first idea.   
And my second one: Is somebody able to create an Ea for that system? It would be interesting how an Ea would handle it, especially for trading more pairs.   
  
Best regards!

Hi astom, It actualy does not matter if its on m2 or m3. If you want you can put the renko indicator on the 1 min chart as many times as you want to make as many different size blocks as you want. Just remember you cant use m1 m5 m15 m30 as these are already used.  
  
The reason i changed was because of the new law, i had to look for a new broker and had to completely resetup every thing.

Hi pilotui, for this new setup i find that the 10 pip block is much better.

I have been trading this new setup for about 2 months now. because i have been experimenting with a number of different brokers lately i dont have a statement to show, just give it a try and see how you make out. But as with all systems, you are going to have good days as well as bad.  
  
A chat room would be a good idea. Thank you.   
  
As far as an EA, I dont know anything about programing, so i cant help you on that....  
  
Happy pipping..............................................

![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1) Yesterday, I maked about 70pips with new setup, that for my account means 5~7%.

Obs: I trade only in open australian market, when the major currency pair ae cold. Basically, I trade with aus/jpy and aus/usd. I tried with NZD, But The spread is very high(fxdd) gave up this currency. Other detail is that i work with 5pips on block, the trends have more variation, but is that my account support, hehe. Soon, I hope, trade with 10pips block.

Good job astom, I think you will find less false signals when you start using 10 pip blocks. that was my conclusion when i was trying 5 pip.

How do you handle the ranging periods Goldflight ???  
  
I mean if you could post some sharts with ranging periods and how you handle those.

Excellent job Maxwell-eqtn. Yes i put fractals on my chart and use trendlines to help me see my charts and what they are doing better.

Good job GF!  
  
Made my first renko trades today (demo). Was focusing on EU before work. Fell for the short headfake before the breakout and lost a quick 40. Put on a trade before going to work ended up +100. +60 for the day on EU (even with the mistake) was good.  
  
The stop management EA you posted earlier helped alot.   
  
What pairs do you usually follow? Which give you the most potential for trades/profit?  
  
Thanks again! Following your posts closely.

So GF, is there a specific indicator that you use to alert when a trade setup might be correct?  
  
Or is it a combination of analysis of all your indy's that lead you to know when a trade is setting up (although Renko can be tricky, and blow through 2 or 3 blocks in a 2 min time)  
  
I"m just trying to get a better grasp as to what the deciding factor is to triggering a buy/sell order.  
  
THanks

Here are the rules,  
  
AO turns green--- 1 EMA (on AO) crosses above 3 EMA (on AO) --- ADX 10 green crosses above red--- BUY.  
  
AO turns orange--- 1 EMA (on AO) crosses below 3 EMA (on AO)--- ADX 10 red crosses above green--- SELL.  
  
These are what you want to watch for Higher highs/higher lows---Lower highs/lower lows--- Support and Resistance--- The 1 and 3 EMA's--- AO color--- ADX--- Trend--- news.

Hello Goldflight. I have modified the GFsignals indicator to reflect your new thinking on the ADX cross. You will see a new boolean parameter in the input block called 'DIcross'. If set to 'true', the ADX signal will change when DI+ and DI- cross. If the signal is long, DI+ must be > DI- and > the previous DI+ bar. If the signal is short, DI- must be > than DI+ and > the previous DI- bar. If DIcross = false, then DIthreshold controls the signal level as before.  
I have added a new set of parameters to specify up to two signal time windows. If 'TimeWindowEnable' = 'true', you can enter one or two time windows as hourly start and hourly stop times. The Gfsignalv1.1 signals will only appear during these windows. The time windows are specified as "Server Time" in interger hours (no minutes). I have found this helpful to me during the night when I only want to monitor trades when something is happening. I live in US EST, and the London open is at 2am. When I was younger, I could stay up all night and still function. Now it has become a problem for me. So I set time windows one hour before the London open until aroung 7am EST, and a second time window for the NewYork open. I then set email alerts, and get up in the middle of the night if I get an alert on my cell phone.  
Good trading.

Thank you EasyRyder for the modifications to this indie. I will put it on my charts and test it .

Not such hard work, really. Once ones gets the framework stable, it becomes an easy matter to modify things. If there are changes that you would suggest, please don't be afraid to do so.

Good moring Goldflight,  
  
And a stunningly beautiful morning it is here in Brisbane this Sunday. My first ever post on FF (I just signed up), although I have been an observer for quite some time.   
  
I recently shifted to a new Broker and the MT4 platform (from GFT) so are not yet 100% familiar with scripts, indicators, experts, etc, etc and are going up the learning curve. I have traded before and have also traded Renko before, and love them.   
  
I have three uninformed questions about the AFX_Trailing file you have generously provided, and I apologise before hand if you have answered them already.  
  
1) Is it a script and therefore should be loaded in scripts folder?  
2) How do I change the parameters? I note it is set by default to a proportional lot size (0.1 I think). I trade full lots (and at times multiple full lots) so need to change the lot parameter and I would like to try different settings for different crosses.   
3) I am with a 5 digit broker. Therefore, do I need to add a zero to all pip values, when I work out how to change them?  
  
I currently have it in the scripts folder, but when I drag it onto a chart it does not give me any options to adjust the parameters.   
  
You have a great trading methodology going here and it is very generous of you to share it and support it in the way you are and have. As I said, this is my first post on FF (which is probably why its so wordy) although I am not new to trading. When I get a little more familiar with MT4, (plus get a few more posts on FF) I hope I can provide something of value back to you and the thread.   
  
Kind regards  
Neal

Welcome Neal, Happy you can join us and thank you for your kind words. MT4 does take a little time to get used to. Just ask when you have questions and someone will be happy to help.  
  
(1). AFX goes in your experts folder. **_To install as an EA :  
  
_**1\. Place the mq4 code in the Experts directory.  
  
2\. Make sure to check the "Allow DLL imports" and "Allow import of external experts" boxes (both of them) are checked. they are under the Saftey section of the Common tab  
  
3\. Also check the "Allow live trading" box in the Live Trading section of the Common tab. Also make sure the Expert Advisors button is depressed in the Gui. When everything is good a smiley face will appear in the upper right hand corner.  
  
(2) To change the settings, just double click on what you want to change, then type in new setting, then click on save, then OK.  
  
(3) Yes for 5 digit broker you must add a zero.  
  
I hope i was able to help. Happy Pipping

I have been using EasyRyders latest version. But it is still to much for me to try and keep up with so many pairs, so i have decided to stick with only 2 pairs. EURUSD and GBPUSD. These are the only pair i am going to trade for now.

Trying something new. I put on a 10 pip renko chart, a 21 EMA high / low channel. Also a MACD with settings of 5, 13, 1. with a zero line.   
  
When MACD crosses zero, and price breaks the channel, price will more times than not, move at least 10 pips.

Hello GoldFlight,  
  
I think the MACD (5, 13, 1) and the H/L moving averages are much better.  
I've been away again and trying to commit.  
  
Will back test this new version over the weekend.  
  
Thanks.

Morning Goldflight / all,  
  
Here is a MACD Alert indicator that may well help you. I found this indi on Mr Nims thread on TSD. It can be be adusted to whatever parameters you wish and when MACD line crosses the signal line an alert is generated.   
  
I hope it helps. I found the alert helps reduce time glued to the screen.  
  
Cheers  
Neal

I have a ton of email alerted indy's  
  
Here's one that alerts/emails the Histo Cross of zero, Signal lines crossing. (NOTE it is defaulted to false on every category)  
  
Hope it helps you.

You are correct. This alert is not triggered when the MACD crosses the zero line but when it crosses the signal line. If it set to 1 it will not trigger. I have been using 5,10,2... or for longer term trades 12,20,5. And the alert is audible/visual, not Email. I use it as that - an alert to attract my attention to then observe the Price Action.  
  
Sorry if I confused you. Hopefully, we can track a MACD that alerts when the histogram crosses the zerro line.  
  
Cheers  
Neal

Hi Goldflight,  
A few quick questions on your MACD/EMA idea:

  1. When you say "breaks thru" do you mean fully breaks thru the high/low channel from one side to the other or just retrace into the channel and then break back out?
  2. Are you waiting for a closed bar (price & histo) to enter?
  3. Does it need to be MACD first (breaking thru 0) followed by price bar? Or does the order not matter as long as they happen with in a bar or 2?
  4. How is this idea working for you in ranging conditions?

I've been playing with 34EMA HL for a while but looking back, 21 seems to give more consistent results. I'd just like to know exactly how you are thinking about it.  
Thanks!

Hi markb,  
  
1\. Both. When price breaks (and closes) outside of channel, by going thru or by retracement.  
  
2\. Yes closed bar.  
  
3\. Doesnt matter which is first, mostly you will see that they are at the same time.  
  
4\. Still early in testing, but ranging market may be a problem if you try to take more than 10 pips.  
  
I hope this helps.   
  
Also a big thank you to Neal and pilotui. I am going to try them both.  
  
Happy Pipping......... Goldflight......

Been researching MA's and think i have found what is needed to help filter some trades. 200 SMA, 55 SMA, and 21 EMA are the most popular. Put them on your charts and you will see how price reacts to them. ( Mine i made into channels. Just my preferance)  
  
200 SMA White  
  
55 SMA Lime  
  
21 EMA Dodger Blue

Sorry i havent posted this week. Been sick again and havent traded all week.   
  
OK, the MA'S im useing are 21 EMA, and 55 Simple MA. Im useing them as filters.   
  
21 above 55, LONG only.  
  
21 below 55 SHORT only.  
  
Watch for price to pull back to 21 or thru 21 to 55 then trade on the bounce.

I think the system is getting better and better. I will post some charts over the weekend on the trades I took. Since I like trading with 5-pip bricks, I have been trying to win 3 or 4 bricks with a stop loss of 3-bricks per trade. I trade only in the direction of the trend. The results are very good so far.

Hi, I trade 10 pip renkos and enter on a pullback to the 21ma too. Where would you place your stops? Sometimes the previous swing low/high can be too far away...

Can you post the afx ea when you have time? Maybe we can get a coded ea for this system after some more manual testing.

These are some pip making trades below. Red is for Sell; Green is for buy.  
I have my own exit rules and did not put them here as they are different at certain times.

Hi Goldflight,  
  
I'm glad I stumbled upon your RENKO thread, it really helps to stay in the trades as long as possible. (like yesterday for example )  
From what I understand you are not the programmer of the renko indicator, or are you? Do you think it would be possible to show Highs and Lows on the past Renko Bars too? I know it can be seen on the original one minute chart, but I thought it would be interesting to see the High and Low the price went to during one Renko bar. What do you think?  
  
I think from a programmers perspective this should be possible.  
  
Regards

There is actually something similar, but it's the other way around.  
I wanted the Highs and Lows on the Renko chart.

This is my final version. I have tried many different indies and always come back to this. So this setup is what i am going to stick to.  
  
8 PIP renko block.  
  
ADX 10. With 40 level line.  
  
Awsome indicator. (set colors to none.) 0 level line  
  
1 and 3 EMA on Awsome indie.  
  
FFCal indie ( to keep an eye on news time)  
  
Pipsometer ( just to track the days performance)  
  
AFX trailing EA on the 1 min chart set at 40 pip s/l, 30 pip trail, 25 pip to break even + 5 pips. ( take profit at your discretion)  
  
All of these indies can be found on the first post. Here is my latest template.  
  
Try it and let me know how you are doing.  
  
HAPPY PIPPING..........

Hi praondevou, Sorry im not the programer of the renko indie. But there are many top notch programers on FF that may be able to help you out. Glad you like what you see, and i hope you will stick around and let me know how you are doing.

Hi Nick,  
  
yes , this is what I meant, Renko charts with candle wicks, indicating price minimum and maximum for the renko candle period.  
The indicator "renko on chart" from my second post is actually doing it, but it shows min and max on the main chart....  
  
cheers

Nick,  
  
thanks for the offer, but as a junior member I can't e-mail you.  
  
Is it possible for you to post it here?  
  
Attached you find an example, I found this on another forum (not sure if I can post it here, it's called "Mr Nims renko ashi trading system 2", but it doesn't work, maybe because the market is closed now... So I have to wait until sunday.  
  
Cheers

RenkoLiveChart_v3.2 EA has an option to show the wicks. Use that instead of RenkoLiveChart_v2.1 if you want to see wicks.

thanks, I had this one, I had it downlaoded to my Expert folder, I attached it to the chart (ShowWicks = True), started the expert, opened the corresponding renko offline chart, but it doesn't show the wicks. I will do some research to see if someone else had this problem.

It works on my MT4 installations. If you are trying it out on the weekend, then it will not work as an EA because there are no ticks being received. You have to generate simulated ticks to get it to run. Here is a script that will do that:   
[http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...4&postcount=43](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4186754&postcount=43)  
or use this program to generate simulated ticks:   
<http://forum.mql4.com/27100>  
  
Other debugging alternatives:  
1\. Try deleting the history file generated if you have used the offline timeframe before.  
2\. Maybe your copy is defective. Try downloading another copy from the source:[ http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3151173](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3151173)

Xaphod,  
  
thanks a lot man, the tick simulator solved my problem. So now I understand why it didn't work on the weekend. No tick - no EA.  
  
This was EXACTLY what I was looking for. :-)

Hi Goldflight/All  
  
been reading through this thread for some time now and been trying out the methodology in a small live account.  
  
I have recently though added the ADX(10) main signal back to be shown.  
  
When this is also above 40 there is a good chance that the trend will hold, below it there seems to be ranging.  
  
Although conventional ADX thinking is over 25 and we are in a trending set-up for Renko it appears to be much higher.  
  
For me it is working well so I thought I would just share to see what anyone else has found.  
  
Regards  
John

Hi jmw1970,  
Yes you are right. On renko charts above 40 level line seems to work the best. Glad this is working for you. Keep posting your findings.

Has anyone tried the much simpler Renko system that crosses the gold channel posted on the first couple of pages? This system seems to want to add all the indicators included in MT4. That combined with some who want to drum up business for mentoring and this thread is tedious. Anyone trying the simpler Renko system?

Hi astom, Yes, for 5 digit broker you must add a zero.

Hi folks,  
  
I found an interesting indicator in another thread. It seems to work really great with renko. Change the inputs to 18 - 5 - 0 - 100 and have a look at it! In my opinion it produces great entries. (Buy or sell trade if the lines cross each other.)  
  
Best regards!

Yes i have tried many indies with this system. But i'm sure that is what FF is for, to try different things to make a system better. As stated in a previous post i have settled on 2 EMA's and 2 indies.   
  
As for this "some who want to drum up business for mentoring" If this was aimed at me, I take offense at this statement. I have never once tried to sell anything. I am only trying to make a profitable system and help others to make some money also.

To me, adding indicators to a renko chart is counterproductive. The whole purpose of renko is to simplify price action direction irrespective of time. Adding indicators, especially ones that are intendend for time based charts, may lead to confusion. It is my belief that renko charts are a tool that is best used without add ons.

Hi All,  
  
be careful with this indicator, the reason it looks so good on the chart is because it recalculates for All bars everytime (ie. a complete repaint),  
  
as the input for the bar is actually taken from the close of the bar afterwards in real time the current bar and last bar are not fixed.  
  
Also the code is not very clever, the last 2 inputs do absolutely nothing.  
  
If anyone wants to see, the source is on code base <http://codebase.mql4.com/source/6719>  
  
Regards  
John

trouble is the current bar in any renko generator on MT4 is bollocks, so for now its all we can do unless we are trading off the previous bar and not current action. as indicators are a painting this just adds to the madness.

Actually, I no matter which broker I use, I never have to add the zero in the end. So it is always 5 or 10 even with 5 digit broker.  
  
I hope he is now not looking at 80 pips blocks *g* 

I found a penny today. That's +100 pips for me.

Hello ReaM,  
Good to see you in this thread too. How long have been following Goldfight's thread & setup? Although I don't use it exclusively I do keep one of his template open on gold regular renko charts ea bricks set to 100.  
Have you did many side by-by-side comparative screen shots with setups from the RTFG threads etc?  
Signal wise are they pretty close or about the same signal?

Hi, 45FXguy  
  
No, I have not been using Goldflight's setup, I am always looking for improvements, reading about renko. I was developing a tactics which I called EMARSI and today I accidently stumbled upon MARSI when I was googling (I thought lol they even called it the same) It is an EMA applied to RSI. Signals are the same as Renko set up, basically, just less clear.  
  
I am still using pandora box with cloud and coral, I also added two pivot point indicators from Sonic thread with daily_or_fibpoints set to "2" :

Here the comparison, just installed Goldflight's renko:  
  
Yes, all signals are exactly the same, IF to ignore those moving averages, they are good for reentering when price bounces of them.  
  
Also the SR indicator that shows last high and low Goldflight has basically draws the pandora box.  
  
By the way the last red line, I just took that trade a minute ago, right after spread calmed down after news! On my 5 brick size, made me +2% on my account. (the screenshot is size 10)

Hi There,  
  
Just thought i would let you all know about an indicator i have added to my Renko set up. Its Pattern_RecognitionMaster_V3 and i have set everything to false apart from Shooting Star 4 and hammer 4. You can see from the pic how you can trade this. I have found 10 pip boxes the best. The wicks in the pic are the same colour as the background (as i like it). You can scalp 10 pips each time or let it run (use other indicators and sup and res).  
  
Let me know what you think.  
  
Cheers   
  
Rob

Hi There,  
  
Other indi's and general trend direction have to be used to minimise false entries but if you look back on a chart the wins far outweigh the losses.

Yes, on that chart it looks perfect, but I did backtest the indicator and when market is barely moving or reversing too often, it will be painful.   
  
It puts a sign on bottom and top, but I think I can see it with my eyes.  
  
I still need to test it live to see when exactly those words appear on chart, I am going to try it next week.

I put 0 in the end, and is better. Because, with 5 digits here, there are many oscillations. In 5 digits, ten pips means one "normal"pip. All right?!

Hi Goldflight  
  
Quick question, with the AFX trailing the trail does not start until Break Even, therefore until the order has made at least 25pips the Stop will still be at 40 pips from entry.   
  
Also the + 5pips, is that the lock?  
  
For orders that immediately go against you do you leave them to hit the Stop or close them out manually if for instance the indicators suggest it?  
  
Thanks in advance

hello jmw1970, Yes once price has moved +25 pips the stoploss will move to +5 pips and then will trail 30 pips. ( will have to move +35 pips before it starts to trail.)  
  
Yes if my trade goes against me and i get signal price is going in other direction, i manualy close trade. I have 40 pip S/L just in case it moves against me too fast to react or if im not at my computer.( old man has to go to the bathroom too much.)  
  
Happy Pipping...............GF. 

I AM WHAT I AM, AND THATS ALL THAT I AM

Thanks for making that comparison screen shot ReaM; I thought that the Fractal s/r indi might be drawing the pandora boxes but never really took the time to check it out as you did. Only version difference in the goldflight's template is I like to use the one with the "Instantaneous Trendline" and "GFsignals", minus the "DailyWoodPivot", but looking back there do seem to be some very significant moves where prices crosses the yellow DailyWoodPivot line on gold 100 point bricks, so I may should leave it on the chart for a while.  
  
Speaking to Goldfight, how important and how long have you used the "DailyWoodPivot", indi and on a scale of one to ten, ten being the highest, would you rate this indicator on your renko chart setup?

RenkoLiveChart 3.2 automatically calculates whether it is 4 or 5 digits, I am not sure about the older 2.1 that is posted here on first page.  
  
Happy pips either way^^ 

I found a penny today. That's +100 pips for me.

Hi All  
  
I quite like using Renko but it still bothers me that it is not possible to do accurate 0 (ie. current bar) analysis.  
  
Previously when I traded using standard time frames, I had a Multi Time frame indicator to guage what was going on at lower and higher time frames, unfortunately with Renko this is not possible unless you open multiple 1m charts with the EA attached and subsequently open all the offline charts, this can lead to a lot of open charts......  
  
Today I managed to code a Renko indicator that gave values for a different Renko brick size to the one that the indicator is attached too, ie. only one offline chart with my actual brick size (8pip) but the indicator shows values for 2pip.  
  
I will attach the indicator so you can see - but this is only at the moment for investigative purposes. (Parms for indi, Box size - pretty obvious - Sensitivity - moving average, rest pretty obvious - the indicator calculates as a percentage the last close against the moving average - ie. the same as having an additional chart open at 2 pip blocks with a 21 SMA)  
  
I am thinking about expanding it to be able to have multiple brick sizes as inputs and have various different standard indies to be displayed as either Bull or Bear.  
  
My current idea for the indies to be shown are 3 moving averages, ADX (Plus/Minus), RSI  
  
If anyone would like to give input, drop a note on this forum.  
  
Regards  
John

Hi All  
  
Well it was probably not such a good idea to write an indicator on a Friday night when I was supposed to be going out .... next thing I knew it was 3 o'Clock in the morning!!!!  
  
Anyway - here is the first version of the Multi Block Size / Multi Indicator for Renko, along with another indicator I wrote (more explanation later)  
  
Note:- This indicator requires the Wingdings 3 font, it is included in the zip folder for ease, this should be placed in the appropriate windows directory (usually WINDOWS/Fonts)  
  
These are Indicators not EA's - they should be placed in the Indicators folder (I know it sounds obvious but people do ask!)  
  
Multi Block Size / Multi Indicator - (!MBS MI Renko)  
Note: ALLWAYS works on the last closed bar - NOT the open one  
  
Parameters  
xi_BoxSize.1 - First boxsize you wish to calculate for  
xi_BoxSize.2 - Second boxsize you wish to calculate for  
xi_BoxSize.3 - Third boxsize you wish to calculate for  
NB. Boxsize is in PIPS, it will automatically adjust to points for 5/6 digit brokers.  
xi_MA.1 - First Moving average  
xi_MA.2 - Second Moving average  
xi_MA.3 - Third Moving average  
xi_MA.1.Method - Method to use on MA 1  
xi_MA.2.Method - Method to use on MA 2  
xi_MA.3.Method - Method to use on MA 3  
NB. To determine whether the trend is up or down it uses the last close and its position to the MA  
xi_ADX - Period for the ADX (Plus above Minus or vice versa)  
xi_RSI - Period for the RSI (RSI above/below 50)  
xb_Visualize - Switch on if you wish to see the bars from another box size  
xi_Vis.BoxSize.Idx - The box size index you wish to see (1,2 or 3)  
xi_Vis.Offset - How many bars in front of the current bar to display  
xi_Vis.Nbr.Bars - How many bars to display  
xi_Vis.Wick.Width - Width of the wick (1 matches standard MT4)  
xi_Vis.Body.Width - Width of the body (depends on the zoom level 3 and 5 are normal)  
xb_Vis.Show.Wicks - Show the wicks or not  
xc_Vis.Bull - Colour of a bull candle  
xc_Vis.Bear - Colour of a bear candle  
xc_Bull - Colour of a bull arrow  
xc_Bear - Colour of a bear arrow  
xc_Text - Colour of the text  
xc_Handle - Colour of the handle (if you wish to move the indicator around on the screen you select the handle and drag it to where you want the indicator to display)  
  
RSI With EMA (!JMW MA RSI)  
xi_RSI - RSI Period  
xi_MA - Moving average Period  
xi_MA.Method - method of the moving average (sma,ema etc.)  
xi_DeadZone - buffer above and below the 50 line which you determine untradeable

Regards  
John

holy moly,  
amazing^^  
  
As I understand it, it shows me the renko chart next to the normal 1M chart?  
  
I wish market was open, it looks very very interesting, thanks!!!  
  
  
Cann the bull bear indi be converted into oscillator? So it oscillates between 100%-100%. 

I found a penny today. That's +100 pips for me.

Hi  
  
not quite, if you have a Renko chart open (normal way 1m chart with EA) offline renko chart at say 8 pips, you can add this indicator to the renko chart and it will show you the indicator values for other renko box sizes as well as if you wish the last x boxes from another renko box size.  
  
You can use the scripts "SendOneTick" "SendFakeTicks" (available on earlier posts) if you wish to try it at the weekend.  
  
Regarding your oscillator question - how exactly do you mean, I have created a "quasi" oscillator on my first example indicator (a couple of posts ago) do you mean something like this??  
  
If so how would you suggest the formula be for certain indicator values (Moving averages I already have a formula, RSI I could probably come up with one) ADX - I have no idea how to turn this into a % - unless you determine a) some kind of threshold and b) something for the distance between +DI & -DI - then calculate that as a %???  
  
Also - any other ideas for indicators to be added (I like my indicators - gives me a nice warm feeling when I enter a trade and all my indicators point the same direction - may not allways end in profit but at least I am happy when I enter.....)  
  
Regards  
John

Hi  
  
Thankfully the weather is cold here in switzerland so nothing better to do than update my indicator.  
  
ReaM asked if the arrows could be switched to an oscillator and as I personally prefer oscillator's to plain arrows I obliged.  
  
However if you still like arrows you can still use this version, showing of the oscillators is default but can be switched off.  
  
I am only going to explain the new parameters added for oscillation, the rest remains the same. Oh and this version fixes the bug that wicks were allways displayed regardless of the option  
  
So - the additional parameters and their explanation:-  
  
xb_Use.Oscillator - switch on if you want values up to 100, off if you just want arrows  
xb_Osc.ADX.2Step - the calculation of the ADX oscillator has 2 steps to get to the final figure, if you only want the first step, switch this to false (explanation of the formula for ADX Oscillator is below)  
xb_Osc.ADX.Threshold - used in the second step of the ADX oscillator calculation  
xb_Osc.ADX.Percent - Percentage of 100 used in determining the ADX oscillator  
xb_Osc.RSI.Percent - Percentage of 100 used in determining the RSI  
  
Regarding the percents mentioned above, in both ADX and RSI even in the extremes they dont get to 100 on a renko chart, which is why there is the possibility to reduce the sensitivity.  
  
ADX Oscillator Calculation  
  
Difference between +DI & -DI = Diff  
Max = 100 / ADX.Percent * 100  
Oscillator = Diff / Max * 100  
  
If 2 step is not on - then this is the oscillator value, otherwise it continues  
  
Oscillator / 2  
Difference between +DI/-DI (whichever is highest) and Threshold  
Osc2 = (Diff / Threshold * 100) / 2  
  
Final Oscillator is Oscillator + Oscillator 2  
  
Hope this make sense.  
  
Regards  
John

Hi all  
  
In case anyone is suggesting changes, these are the changes in my development version which is going through testing at the moment:-  
  
Display of a fingerprint (optional) - will display a "fingerprint" of the last 20 bars on all the renko block sizes  
  
When using oscillator values a mark to indicate whether the value has gone up or down since the previous bar.  
  
If anyone has any other suggestions for improvement please advise - allways open for comments

John

Hi All,  
  
here is the latest and probably last version of the multi indicator for Renko, for simplicity I have included also the Moving Average RSI and Wingdings 3 font again in the zip file.  
  
Changes/Fixes in this version are:-  
  
Fix - Calculate start bar based on first bar in M1 not the renko chart  
Chg - New option for displaying of a "fingerprint". This details the last 20 candles Up or Down on the 4 block sizes being analyzed. The bars are displayed left to right (like a chart) with the most recent bar being on the far right.  
Chg - If the display oscillator values is selected, then a small dot will appear to the right of the value, this will be at the top of the number if the oscillator has moved up, at the bottom if the oscillator has moved down.  
  
Remember this indicator only deals with closed bars - the Zero (or current) bar is completely ignored (therefore on the oscillator example above it compares bar 1 to bar 2)  
  
Unless someone has something really special to add to this indicator the indicator will remain as is.  
  
I am currently working on a "Trade Pad" expert advisor, this will allow you to trail stops automatically, have hidden stops (for the more unscrupulous brokers out there), move SL,TP and in pending orders Entry Price by moving a line, as well as place Market & Pending orders by pushing a button on the chart (this is easy in MT5 - bit of a pain in MT4):- If anyone would be willing to help "beta" test this I would be most grateful.  
  
P.S. Today was not such a good day for trading GU, EU but after yesterday who cares????  
  
Regards  
John

Had a little trouble using that version of wingdings font on windows xp, it was messing up the display of some of my other indicators so had to go back to using my old one. Was wondering if anyone else had an issue with that font?  
Also think maybe you should rename the indicator John's Swiss Army knife, since it will probably server renko scalpers the most who like to see the smaller price moves on the lower size bricks, as they trade off larger ones. Your indi seems a lot like the one Forexflash started well over a year ago, but his seemed to be a bit buggy & he never fixed it, so far happy to say besides that minor font issue, your coding seems of swiss quality. Thanks again for your working on this and please continue, & looking forward to testing your ea when it's ready!

PS: It seems your latest version works perfectly now with my older windings font.

Hi 45Fx / All  
  
Thanks for the feedback, not sure what the problem was with the font, I use XP as well, maybe yours is a newer version of the font file. I included the file mainly for those who didn't already have the font installed.  
  
NOTE:- To anyone installing this indicator do not bother with the font UNLESS you do not already have it.  
  
Regarding the name, my original name did include swiss army knife, but on a search of forums I found a range of indicators already with this name so I didn't want to confuse people. Thats the problem with trying to name indicators, someone generally has already used the coolest names.  
  
Regards  
John

Hi Guys,  
  
I've been working on a strategy for a while which doesn't use indicators just basic technical analyses (tops,bottoms,break outs etc..). The logic is pretty complex so I'm not going to write it all down right now, but I'm interested in your opinion. Please check it out, if you find it promising I can open up a separated thread to discuss.  
  
Basics:  
  
**Trigger:** Opposite direction bar close / or break up/break down bar  
**Target:** Previous top/bottom / or some trailing when break out  
  
**Top/Bottom definition:** At least 4 bars in one direction than at lest 3 bars in the opposite direction  
  
Picture explanation:  
  
**Tops/Bottoms:** marked with purple boxes  
**Trade Opening:** Red arrow (up/down - LONG/SHORT)  
**Opening/Closing price:** Yellow dots  
**Stops:** Grey dots  
  
I always open trades at bar close. I use 3 bars for stop normally, 2 bars stop for break up/break down entries. I use trailing stop with a special logic (will explain later). I use tops/bottoms to analyze the trend, so I don't always open positions for both directions.  
  
I trade 2 strategies basically.  
  
1\. "Turn bar" - it happens when an opposite direction bar closes. Preferable at a previous top/bottom. I use the previous top/bottom for target and 3 bars stop.  
2\. "Break out" - when a break out occurs from a significant top/bottom (at least 2 tops/bottoms - marked purple boxes). I use trailing.  
  
In the given screenshot I marked the trades manually for illustration. There were 12 trades, 11 profitable 1 loss. I noted the profit/loss in pips. I used 10 pips renko bars.  
  
Regards,  
Balazs

Farkasb, that looks really promising, seems like a great strategy, I'll be sure to try it out.   
I would be happy if you would open a new thread so you can explain further. (remember to link to it here)

Thank you Balazs for your strategy and of course I would like to hear more about it. But have a question, see attached image, why you didn't open trades where I marked white vertical lines as far as I understand that was valid entries, right?  
  
Looking forward to hear from you.

Hi,  
  
At the first line, you are right, but I had to start the picture somewhere ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1). Anyway, it would't have made any difference, because it would't have hit the stop, so in fact we can consider that the position was opened there. It would have resulted the same.  
  
At the second, the trend was still short according my trend definition rules (however, it looks otherwise after that bounce). I check the last two tops and bottoms in pairs and their relative positions to each other. So for example if the second top (the latest) is lower than the prior one, than they suggest a down trend. Similarly consider the bottoms. In this case, the last two tops were down so were the last two bottoms (they are tricky a bit, because the closest bottom appear to be higher, but it wasn't a real bottom at that moment because it became a bottom only after the 3rd bar - see my top/bottom definition).  
  
Hope it explains.  
  
Balazs

Hi Farkasb,  
  
Fellow renko trader here. Looks like you have a nice strategy based on price action - the key to the market. It would be good to start a thread or a trading journal on it. This thread here is Goldflights place for testing his ideas, and I reckon the more renko threads we have, the better! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60e.png?v=15.1)  
  
Let us know when you start the thread and let's get some good strategies going!

Hi All  
  
For those of you using pivot points on Renko Charts beware of the following  
  
If you use daily wood pivots (as provided in template from Goldflight)  
a) The calculation of Pivot Point is wrong, it uses H+L+C+O/4, the official method is H+L+C/3;  
b) The way it determines whether a bar needs to be included in the calculation is based on its open time, on normal time based charts this is not a problem as all bars will open and close within one day, this is not the case on a Renko chart, a bar can open one day then close another.  
  
General warning, if your server is not GMT based then your pivot points will not match the official ones.  
  
The differences can be significant, yesterday on EU the Pivot Point was 16 PIPS higher (or in my case 2 blocks);  
  
Just for information if you use (as I do) Pivot points in your trading decisions.  
  
Regards  
John

Hi Guys,  
  
As I'm new to forexfactory I'm a Junior Member at the moment, therefore opening a new thread is not allowed to me yet. I'll do it once I got my membership upgraded. Do you know when does it supposed to happen? What should I do to be a member?  
  
..or alternatively, some of you may open it up and I'll post. We could name it for example "RENKO strategy for price action".

I would make a thread, but I'm junior as well (I think), and when I registered I belive it said it would take like 6 hours, which has passed quite a whila ago.  
Let's hope you get upgraded soon, can't wait to evolve and learn more about this strategy ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

Hello John,  
Could you please take a look at these two indis and tell me if what you think about them. Your work reminded me of them, & was wondering if you think the code & logic behind them is good or could be improved upon etc.  
PS:  
I added a screen shot so you might know what both these indis look like on the bottom of a chart. I reset the multyboxrenko indi Forexflash made but still shows two 16 pip bricks one says buy, other says sell, see what I mean about it being a bit buggy? Think you can fix?

Hi,  
  
Having looked at the code I have the following comments:-  
  
MultyBoxIndicator, this indicator effectively shows buy/sell dependant on whether the last box is over the second to last and the second to last is over the third to last. There is no coding for wait, therefore in the case of 1up / 1down it will show it will show the value of the last box.  
  
I couldnt replicate the problem you had (same boxsize different signal), although there is probably a typo somewhere, it replicates the code 5 times for each boxsize in a different routine instead of using the same one with parameters.  
  
Regarding the timer, I was expecting this to be based on how complete the box is as it is based on percentage (basic maxim for using a percent - you must know the maximum), it isn't - it uses time in seconds multpilied by the period, I for instance use period 82, other people use 2,3 4 etc.  
  
If you think about how a renko box is you would need a scale of -100 to 100, 0 being the close of the last bar, on a 10 pip block, each pip movement in the same direction of the current trend would equal 10% of the timer, each pip in the opposite direction would equal 5% (as a renko block requires twice the number of pips to reverse).  
  
Again not quite sure how this is helpful, you can see the formation of the block on the chart therefore can "guestimate" its completion.  
  
The possibility indicator, I found more useful, though I have the following comments, it measures the ticks as either bull or bear which is OK, however it does not measure the strength of the tick it simply adds it to bull/bear.  
  
This means you could receive 5 ticks Bear which result in for example 5 pips of movement down, and receive 20 ticks Bull which only results in 2 pips of movement (especially when using 5/6 digit brokers), the possibility indicator would show this as Bull whereas the correct value should be Bear.  
  
All in all, I believe the possibility meter could be modified to be more relevant, the multybox I have my reservations.  
  
On another note I see you still are having some problems with the fonts, those little yellow "z"'s are supposed to arrows!! But if you have no problem selecting them to move the panels around the screen - I see no issue - if I release a new version I think I will have the special codes available as parameters.  
  
Sorry I couldn't be more helpful.  
  
Regards  
John

Goldflight, in a previous post you said we could use a simulator on weekends.  
I installed it but I don't understand how to use it so there are Renko bars on the chart?

Goldflight, does it matter where the AO MAs cross over? E.g is the signal stronger near the 0 line or weaker etc  
  
  
Also, thank you Xaphod __for the link

Sorry for double post (in case anyone gives a shit)  
  
Goldflight, how do you know when a trade is going against you? How would you spot this? Or do you simply wait for it to hit SL?  
I'm using the final version of your system

A scalping method i have been working on.  
  
I have 4 charts. Top 2 are EURUSD / GBPUSD, M2, offline, 3 pip block Renko.  
  
Bottom 2 are EURUSD / GBPUSD, 4 Hr chart with all colors set to black. On them is the nonlagdot indie set at 25. And a clock indie.  
  
When dots are blue on 4 Hr chart, I am looking to LONG ONLY on the renko chart.  
  
When the dots are red, I am looking to SHORT ONLY.  
  
Here are the charts and todays trades.

Hi Goldflight  
  
good to see you back posting in your thread,  
  
ok - I understood how you get the direction (non-lag dot on 4hr) but what do you use to determine when to enter on the renko chart?  
  
also fixed TP or wait for reversal, SL - last swing low?  
  
I liked the previous method a lot - my problem was always entering as it got into rangebound mode.  
  
Regards  
John

Hi Goldflight glad to help, my method i'm using uses very few indicators which is what i like.  
I've been able to keep my drawdown between 3-7 pips for most pairs.  
  
I'll post everything i'm doing with as much rules detail as i can on sunday.

Hi jmw1970,  
  
Glad you are still here also. I enter on the first green candle (if 4 Hr is saying long, or red candle if 4 Hr is saying short. ) after a pullback. Sometimes i exit on first or second reversal candle, and sometimes i just let the trailstop hit. Just to see if the pullback is small and see if price will keep going in my favor.  
Good luck..................GF.

Hi Goldflight  
  
looking more carefully at your statement it looks as though you are opening multiple positions at different times in the trade direction  
  
for instance in the trades that were closed at about 17:08 your broker time there were 8 open trades of 0.5 lots for EURUSD.  
  
Is this part of the strategy - to continually add new positions, and if so at what point - because some of the later positions on the EU buy were opened at a lower price than the first one, ie. the price had not gone in your favor  
  
Regards  
John

Yes i had gotten very agresive and was opening new trades on every new green bar after a red bar as long as 4 Hr chart still had a blue nonlag dot. I would not recomend doing this all of the time. I am still looking to find a safer entrie point....................GF.

Hi Goldflight here is my 8 renko bar test results for the asian session today.  
I'm not really comfortable with 8 bar renko i think you get in too early but so far so good.  
_waited for each trade to be at the pivot line to get me a little more confirmation._  
more testing to come

Just as you did, I could as easily ask why 1 hour and not 4? There is no way to rationalize forex. If H4 works better than H1, then this is what you use.  
  
I don't know if it does in our case here, I have not and will not test it, but there is no reason to ask this question. The only way is to backtest the H1 and H4 and compare the results, which I assume he did.  
  
It took me two months of backtesting of a system and I tested basically every parameter you could. Example: if I intend to use EMA 100, because it seems to give good results, then I would also test EMA 95 and EMA 105 (and probably 90 and 110 and so on). Yet I must say, overadjustment is just as bad as jumping in without any adjustment, simply because one likes H1 better than H4. 

I found a penny today. That's +100 pips for me.

Not to be annoying but all versions of RenkoLiveChart prior to v3.2 are buggy and have been deprecated.  
  
Hop over to EllisEdi's Renko thread and grab a copy of v3.2 or 3.3 - still free (open source) and works great... 

Old Benjamin was right

try opening the strength meter on a M1 chart let it run for 5 minutes then hit M5 and it should show up.

Right click on your chart and then click on "save as picture" then select "active chart (as is)" then save it to your desired location on your computer.

For the strength meter.   
  
Right click on your curencies that are listed on the left where you see the bid/ask.  
  
So right click, and click on "show all".

The indies are the standard Awesome Oscilator with the colors set at none, with 1 and 3 ema on the AO, and the ADX set at 10. I also use AFX Trailing EA but it has to be on 1 min chart, it wont work on off line chart.

Could you please let me know where to put all those files you mentioned in Post# into the appropriate MTA folders. I am not getting certain things on my MT4 at the moment. Not sure which is EA, Scripts, Templates in Expert, Templates in root MT4 folder, or indicators. Would very much appreciate that. I am new to MT4.  
Cheers.

DrDre - no, have not seen a renko or range bar like that.  
Attached is RenkoRangeBar indicator for those who prefer the combination of renko and range. Illustration is 5 pip setting.

Can someone attach the EA for me? Thanks

How is your scalping strategy going? Do you still use the final version method?
