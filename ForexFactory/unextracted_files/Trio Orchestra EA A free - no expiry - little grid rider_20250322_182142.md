Hello,  
  
this is a thread dedicated to a Grid EA that I was following on another thread. Unfortunately thread owner , seems to be hiding its final intentions to keep it free  
for all here. There is always very short expiry dates (days) ...and with a grid , if you are catched in a pull-back while sleeping time , with no control on your trades ...well your account...just WAS.  
  
I could find the mq4 file that originated the Pipbeast EA ...so I could rename Orchestra ..well TrioOrchestra now V1.0 till we further/tweak this amazing scalper.  
  
I have still have to find a pal programmer to make some additions and mod´s such we can get full control of its behaviour ....adding settings , buttons , whatever  
the suggestions come by to make this tool OURS ..and free ..always.  
  
DISCLAIMER : PLEASE DO NOT USE THESE EA (here in the thread) ON REAL ACCOUNT TILL MAJOR CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE  
This is a Grid trader ,who likes ranging market, any consistent trend without retrace will  
kill your account even with only one pair.  
  
As per March 2nd,2018 I am only testing demo XBest V2.2 . But others more sofisticated Version havebeen published further in this thread.  
Our 2 coders are Yamil and Rodolfo and are doing their best to implement an hedge function , that will be activated when account starts to entering in large DD.  
  
I consider large DD on a grid somewhere @ 20/25% . I also recommend 50% equity protection ON. And only ONE trade per candle activated.  
And also, if you see DD building up on a pair on the recomended TF15 minutes , start thinking in switching your TF to 30 min.

Hi there, the famous Ilan EA. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f600.png?v=15.1) I had the idea to programme a Hedge recovery function into it. Just so it doesnt blow the account.

Hi BMC , welcome here ..this will be our EA , and yes , there is a lot of potential on this EA....so much to tweak. Start/Stop Hours , NEWS filter maybe to be added in future ...no more sell or buy when arriving at some S/R levels ... For me Forex all started in 2008 when viewing an add ...about a Night Scalper trading EURGBP, EURCHF and GPBCHF on Asian session ...I just jump on the train to get a Ferrari same as the guy that was offering us the good deal EA for 99$.... , then I spent month  
trying to take control on BLESSING ea ( "old" thread lurkers know this one) ...  
  
I have now just opened this thread and I will sure find some good hearted and skilled programmer ..( I know TWO here @ FF) ...

Well I wrote down some ideas on the hedge function, but would need some feedback and a programmer who would like to take the time to look at it. Will send it tomorrow.

Hi Hibra , yes. I agree with you ..I did backtested a few pairs ...even the AUDNZD ....I managed to find settings that do not blow the 3,000$ demo account...with a profit factor of 1,08 ...barely 10% annual return..lol. Are we here at Forex for 10% annually ? NO... We mostly are here to find eventually a revenue replacement if  
"shit happens" and to try to pay the bills , rent , scholarships , etc.... and playing ...gambling and make money . Whatever strategy to reach this aim is just fine.  
  
As the TrioOrchestra is right now ...it is for sure an account blower ...even one pair on 3k ...will blow our account eventually ...We all agree to this here ...let me share  
below my approach ...

I remember the name Fapturbo ( the 99$ bot I purchased) a night scalper...my 1st EA (paid) ...6 others have followed since then.  
  
This EA was to be traded during the Asian session ...from somewhere after NY close till 2-3 hours before Frankfurt or LO open.  
So, I though that maybe I could give a try to these pairs :  
  
USDCHF,GBPUSD,EURUSD,USDCAD,EURGBP,EURCHF,GBPCHF,EURCAD,CADCHF,GBPCAD ...which are all unlikely to suffer a big trend during Asian sessions  
since at this time the movers would likely be AUD NZD JPY .... with news release .....during Asian session ...almost no move , quite flat on pairs USD GBP  
CAD CHF EUR with al their crosses ....no speech , no news ...nothing.  
  
As an example here CADCHF ...42 pips during asian session ....perfectly ranging ...this is what we need to look deeper to make a grid succesfull ..IMO.

With 3 pairs ...I managed to make 90$ monopoly money ...with 0,01 starting lots...GBPCHF, EURGBP, GBPCAD.....maximum was 4 levels ....low DD 2,3%...  
Just my 1st night trying this strategy ...all red numbers in the report below are from another EA ...that I will soon drop.

![](/attachment/image/2665491?d=1517952277)

  
  
when starting to bite a little on Frankfurt open ...I stopped the EA ...and closed all the trades with very small loss... maybe 4/5 $ .... I was done for the night..lol.  
  
So, I invite you to share your results here ..if you decide to give a try to this strategy ..with the help of the Orchestra V.01.  
  
After this I left the EA running on USDJPY and EURGBP all day long ...just for fun or build up some equity.

When backtesting this weekend...I mistakenly pressed somewhere on the chart and suddenly these common indicators just appeared. So , my guess is that the Trio  
involve a combination of CCI with MACD onfirmation , STO + MACD confirmation , RSI + MACD ....but this is just a guess.As this is not a template I use.

Hi Stefdek,  
  
First of all, thanks for making the code for this available. I was testing Pipbeast's EA over the last couple of weeks because I had never experienced an EA before. It's nice to be able to see the code behind it, as I'm not a fan of 'black boxes.'  
  
I have some issue with getting the EA to take long positions though. Any idea why that might be? I tested it on 6 pairs but it will only take shorts. In the properties tab of the EA I selected both long & short trades, but it will only go to the short side.

Hi Al ,  
  
just to be sure ...are you talking about Pipbeast ea or the one shared here ??  
  
I am testing this EA on an Aussie broker which allow hedging ..with no issue.( take trades both buy and sell on the same pair ) ...US Brokers do not allow hedging , limit leverage to 1/50 ...and,US citizens, because of lobby in financial market are not allowed to open live account outside the US ...so foreign brokers can ´t accept them.  
  
Is this your case ??

As you can all see ..during Asian session, Bollinger Bands "squeeze" indicating a rather flat market ..the indi at the bottom is called bbsqueeze and obviously confirm this.Asian session has started ....

This .mq4 isn't the original source code. That's an illegal pirated/decompiled file.

I am testing this EA on an Aussie broker which allow hedging ..with no issue.( take trades both buy and sell on the same pair ) ...US Brokers do not allow hedging , limit leverage to 1/50 ...and,US citizens, because of lobby in financial market are not allowed to open live account outside the US ...so foreign brokers can ´t accept them.

Well, both actually. But the hedging makes sense. I'm in the U.S. so no hedging allowed here. Thanks for the speedy reply though.

ILAN is not a particularly good ideFour sets of indicators are used to filter, and if there is resonance, it will open the warehouse.   
Four sets of indicators are used to filter, and if there is resonance, it will open the warehouse. If it is a tendency K, it will be very difficult to appear.

Why is that EA _different_ than any other Grid EA?  
Can someone explain the _logic_ in few words?

Hi Stefdek,  
  
First of all thank you very much for the EA. I have loaded it yesterday on 3-different Australian Brokers and they are working fine. Second thing I have started EA with 5-mnts, 15-mnts and 1-hour on different brokers let see how it goes. Till now all of them showing positive results. The reason behind selecting all Australian brokers are very low on spread. Appreciate your help.

This is why we spent so much time and energy on pipbeasts thread.  
There were lots of suggestions: Let the EA only trade during ranging conditions,including trend filter (I posted there), or as member coder had the idea of measuring the currency strength, and when strength is down > trade, otherwise not.  
So we thought about diversified entries for currencies, that assume not to trend during the next days (weeks)...  
Then there was the talk about news filter, so news have no impact.  
Someone else had the idea of spike detection, when a spike comes, stop trading/selling positions...  
Then there was that idea of exit strgategy by hedge-system, whereas I don't know how that shall work...  
I think you can improve the EA, backtest results of pipbeasts EA showed us so.  
You only have to figur out when a currency is trending (strength), and when not.  
Actually that should be madeable ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Продолжайте торговать, после pipbeasts ЕА, но это Trio_dancer советник 3_1. Они имеют одну и ту же работу. Параметры часто меняются. Рад, что вы продолжили тему!

Hi Ramil,

help pipbeast make money of us here are my last results that i posted in his thread.  
This are my results for this week starting Sunday I started Sunday with $5922 because of the winnings from last week. I used 3 pairs Eur Gbp on 0.3 lots, eurjpy m15 with 0.3 lots and exp 1.3 pip 50.0 and usd jpy with 0.3 lots. I completely forgot about nonfarm on the usa. Ive been runing the EA nonstop since Sunday. Im running version 1.7 but towards the end of friday, i switch back to the first release version so I can continue the test. Thank you for the hard work pipbeastfx

Hi , for better understanding of this EA and logics you can drop it on a demo account. I am not the creator of the ea, originally it was a russian ( I think) , I do  
not fully understand deeply the logics behind entries , but entries are indicators based , so , this is the 1st detail that differs from several grid that open 1 buy 1 sell once ea loaded on chart. This one has 3 engines inside , so , sometimes ..NOT everytime it will open 3 positions ...sometimes at the very first bar/candle , sometimes not , positions can be 2 buys ..one sell ..or 3 sells ...etc... .  
  
2nd difference with others grid ..is the spacing ....it is dynamic...although standard settings are set to 30 pipettes ( 3 pips) ...do not be too afraid of this , it will only open another position on the next candle .... Which means ...Ex : 5 Min chart = 5 min candle .... imagine NEWS ...in 5 minutes price can move 40 pips ( often more) away from already opened positions ...the next position will then be opened on the 5M candle close ...only IF 30 pipetes rule (3 pips) has been "broken".  
  
This is mainly why I have a special interest in this grid EA ....quite different of others...

Quick question I know in the old one it we were suppose to start with a 5k account but I have put it to trade 3 pairs with 5k and it has done well. I was wondering what would be the less amount to start to trade with one pair and still be profitable. I also change the lot size to .03 on all of them.

Hi Lua, please be aware that ..as EA is actually ...it is an account blower ...whatever your starting lot might be ...0,01 ...it will eventually blow your account EVEN with one pair on 3k or 5k ....did you ever did backtests ?? . Please do not drop this ea on a live account till you fully undertand the mechanics of a grid or martingale ...in a trending market , you will sure (sorry for the expression) sh*** in your pants.  
  
You will also need leverage = or > than 1/200 ...and assuming your FF location is accurate ...US citizens are only allowed brokers with 1/50 leverage AND no hedging allowed...

I’ve been running this in a demo account for the past 3 weeks into it started expiring on people I stopped I let the trades just run by them self and you are right it did blow. I made the EA be more aggressive but as you can see in a week of trading it made me 4K which is not bad.

Hi, I renamed it ...with fancy name too ..lol just to mimmic Pipbeastfx behaviour ...but WITHOUT hiding inside engine running under the hood ...with the free source mq4 . So, you can rename it yourself editing the mq4 file with your MT4 . King Boxers EA : 3 strategies : Tyson,Ali , Foreman ...whatever you feel comfortable with . Could have been Pipbeast EA Uncovered V.3 too though .

It's good you started this thread my friend. Very excited. This EA is an account blower as you mentioned but it can be used as a money collector in a tight range market.  
  
So if you know what the market is doing before you make the robot work you, it's great.  
  
The Idea that took my attention in that scammer Pipbeast's thread was to put a hedge function on that Trio dancer. 

There are no weapons that will form against my financial prosperity.

Hi Rockit , I am not running this on live account , NO WAY till I get a coder that can do some mods to the code.  
  
Start hour , stop hour .... close all , close all on this pair , stop starting new cycles at GMT selected time , eventually news filter ..... But anyway you can still play  
doing all this manually ..... but till I found a good hearted coder to do needed tweaks ...this can't be backtested with success.  
  
As I said above , my idea is to run this ea ...on Asian session ...when market is flat ...on 4 or 5 pairs ..... no JPY crosses, no NZd or AUD envolved since there are news release on theses pairs during asian session.

Andrew , you are damn right here ...there might be another pipbeastfx ...birthing here @ FF with tweaks an EX4 expiry ...or license lock. If I can't find a free coder  
I will pay one ......and share the PAID mq4 here ... no more hostages ...I will pay the ransom.

The Idea that took my attention in that scammer Pipbeast's thread was to put a hedge function on that Trio dancer.

unveiled by Husky77 : pipbeast is asking for 199$ for un unlocked copy .... for me a scam is when you do not unveal your final intentions ..to sell the final product  
once all the one´s that helps to develop and backtests ..sharing settings are at a certain moment held in hostage , to pay for something that they thought was free share spirit. Pipbeastfx should have gone commercial ...from the early stage of this... I have NO problem with clear intentions to sell a product when this is defined from the early stages ...otherwise it is a scam . Renkotop ...agree ?

Once upon a time in Forex factory, there was a bad hearted witch named Pipbeastfx. This witch had opened a thread for improving per say "his own EA" named Pipbeast EA. That Ea was in fact the old Trio Dancer EA but the Black hearted witch was hiding that truth from his members and willing to maintain much interest from the good hearted members just to collect their money for his own benefit.  
  
When the emperor learned the intention of that witch, he sent his knight Stephan for saving the members of the witch's thread.  
Starting from that day, the thread started to be called as the scammer's thread and the good hearted members of the Scammer's thread moved to the new thread started by the knight Stephan.  
  
That's the tale. My friend. Some may tell it in a different way.  
  
Here is the ancient Scammer's thread.

just to be sure i launched pipbeast on [tickmill](/brokers/tickmill "View Tickmill Broker Profile") (left) and trio (right) on [pepperstone](/brokers/pepperstone "View Pepperstone Broker Profile")  
as you can see (for the sceptics) it is indeed the same EA strategy wise.

Money management and recovery strategy are key to the EA. The Hedge strategy mentioned is a good idea if implemented correctly. So is there a coder interested in helping out here?

If I'm not mistaken, it is based on three strategies. That would make them even disable and it is possible to find out which one is the most unprofitable

@ birpinar : The Version I found was 3.11 ...  
  
@luaciego EURUSD GBPUSD and trending pairs might also be tested at london open ...as suggested by SHUM ...with starting lot 0,1 instead of 0,01 to accomplish  
a 100$ profit quickly ..then close remaining open trades ...contact him ..he will explain his interesting strategy here ..I understand it ...but not testing this at the  
moment ...

pipbeastfx founded a group of 18 or somewhat traders, and in the early stage I was in.  
I just thought: "Why should I have a privilege, to be there and do my work, trade for some weeks for free, and others who just recently joined the thread will never again hear something about it?!" I quited the group. And now found out that pipbeast is asking for 199$, hahah.  
There are still some people in his group And here, I think they should decide whether to follow.  
And yes, there is an expiry date: 11.03  
Edit: I have controversial information for the expiration of the EA 1.9; I already said I think it expires first days in March, but another member who also received the EA from pipbeast was told it does not expire, another one quoted pipbeast saying each ea has an existing period of 1 month. Who knows, just be careful at the beginning of next month. 

Check page 1 for all infos...

Hi stefdek,  
I think you will be very lucky if any coders here will work on any of these ea's. It looks to me like they are all decompiled code. Anyway, good luck with your thread.

Info from the forum (translated from Russian)  
Tradindg pairs: all majors and gold and silver. Overall 30 pairs. TF: H1  
Starting depo 100k. Fixed lot 0.1 per trading pair.  
_Торгуемые пары: все мажоры + золото и серебро. Всего 30 пар. ТФ: H1.  
Стартовый депо 100к. Поставил фикс лот: 0.1 на каждую пару._  
  
I think 30 pairs is too much and lot can be 0.01 with 10k account.  
  
Anyway this all must be cheked and optimized - take a look - demo acc on mfxbook monitor was burnt. Martingale is martingale...

Hi to all. I will not speak about what happened in another thread, and why author did what he did. God see all of us, and all of us will be payd for what we did in the past, with the same valute.  
  
I have this Ea, i speaked with somebody to put some new parametres, but that person steel didnt respons to me. Almost a week i wait.  
I dont know what version of trio dancer is in this thread, i have 3.1 version.  
I think its need 4 buttons on the chart, and one parameter, daily target in money.  
4 click buttons  
Start- starting Ea to take trades  
Stop - stop Ea to take any new trades  
Close all - close all positions on the pair with Ea( not all trades from other pairs)  
Restart- this button is need just for restart Ea to trade after daily target is reached. If no, then Ea dont take any new trade after tg riched in that day.  
For the moment thats it.  
How to trade with all this, i will say next time, after this parametres will apear on EA.

Can this Ea consistently make profits for you? - diffenitly yes.   
No 100% automatic trading, no trading in the night  
Quiq tp, human decide when start new series of trades.   
Look on TMS system H4 , for market direction and trends. Trade 1-3 pairs at all with this Ea, no more than 2 pairs in the same time.  
Make a plan for the month, what tp need for the day, week, month. What time to trade, what pair. For ex today no any trade on EG, coz soon bank cash rate gbp.   
So plan your work. This is not hobby, this must be work.

i dont know, meaby i am not right about daily target, and you dont need it.. But i am a scalper trader at the moment, and know for sure that low tp its a key of succes for me.. i even can trade intraday system like TMS H4, but i don whant..i feel comfortable with scalp systems..this is why i found this ea, that can be a good tool for scalping some money from the market, not pips!..money! with this ea you can be minus in pips and in profit in money.  
I will show you exemples from my EA, (january trades)...what i developed one year ago, it have 5 pips tp..  
this is for show to you, what is more easy to earn..100 pips or 5 pips..? 1k dol or 100 dol quiq  
ps, there is just one loss, but is a tehnical loss, i close this trade buy myself, accidentally, it wasnt rule of the system..  
anyway some trades a close manualy before that trades go to tp.

Wow all i got to say is Pipbeast is a scum bag after people helped him make it what it is he goes around and charges people. I didn’t get invited because I was one of the first ones to say something about the expiry. I also bet he is around lurking reading this thread.

Thank you for "reanimating" the good discussion done in the prior thread.  
Hopefully we can find and develop the old status.  
  
I followed the other thread, but unfortunaly I don´t have the skills to take part  
in programming. But - like other silent Viewers - I can test the results of your work.

I was said 11.3, someone told me he thinks it is forever and another one quoted a post of pipbeast saying that 'each' EA he offers someone to use has an existing date of 1 month. (This is how he keeps his members together, as long as they follow him he will feed them each month with updates, ... hehe)

Hi maahome , yes it is decompiled code of an old ea ....which has been renamed several times ..by differents scammers , most showing how succesfull they were with the ea just dropping it on a chart and activating the smiley, they SELL/sold this .....hit and run style . We all know this will never work as is ..as SHUM mencioned you have to use it as a tool at a defined moment .....set and forget EA .btw , do "they" exist ?..will never be this "Trio" as it is now  
  
I am more looking as this ea as a tool , just crossing my mind now as an example trading H4 signals Zig Zag (example) and entering an excessive DD ( not planned) ... you can apply "the close the looser asap...let winner ride" philosophy or maybe give a chance to Trio/illian/PBFX taking care of this magic numbered position.  
  
Coder: is NEVER obliged to reveal his name , nor leave its stamp.Job can be done free or paid. It might be for sure unethical ..I agree Ferru , but original coder already have screwed a bunch with this one set and forget ( is he still alive?) ..russian´s sharing free code....so , why not us ?? . Of course if there is any kind of legitimate property claim WITH PROOFS , thread will be shut down.

Now , look at the picture below ...did you ever saw a grid martingale behave like this one ? If yes ..please share here.

This is a dynamic grid ..really amazing ...GBPCHF on Asian 5min chart ...I knew there were red news for GBP ahead ...so (demo) I switched TF to 15 min chart before going to sleep...ea kept taking care of my opened pos in DD...took others on TF15 ..and withstanded a 234 pips move DOWN ... .

stefdek thanks for sharing.i run it on demo right now on EURJPY,with lot size 0.01.account size 200 eur,EA make right now 214 eur with 8 eur drawdown.My idea is this - we can set this way if profit reaches 10 eur we stop,if loss reach 10 eur we stop too,Need to test many times if this EA makes more 10 eur profits then loses then we found succeful EA.But I still cant belife that it can be true![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f62c.png?v=15.1)By the way watching how EA does trades is funyer than whatch any movie![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f642.png?v=15.1)

Welcome here Fitchi , yes totally agree with you real fun to see this ea surfing the waves ...when backtesting in visual mode this is a "show" .  
  
I am still looking for a coder (paid or free) to develop the needed tweaks here and there ...so we can have our own tool ..and not buying or paying ransom on this one.  
This weekend I will have time to dedicate to this ..( I have a day job...family , kids , etc..)

for the daily target, is there a way to merge two EA into one?  
like merging trio with an EA that manage daily target?  
or it would be easier to code a function in trio?

I am no coder - ZERO - but this function has to be built inside ea ...to STOP taking trades when defined profit reached.  
  
the only external EA that could do something externally would be close all open trades when profit/equity % and shut MT4 platform ... is there any here @ FF ??

Yes I agree ... Only those who are respectfull of others' work care about this.  
  
If the file was decompiled (no code available), that means the original coder _was not willing to share the code_. That must be respected.

I am no expert to explain in details what is exactly all about this Volatility meter or ratio , although it is quite self explained , but what I can tell you is that  
when @ GMT 3:15 to GMT 4:45 on EURGBP...this number always stayed in red ( minus) ......pipping up 2 pips ....pipping down 3 pips ...FLAT ...with a grid we  
need some volatility ...so we can close the basket. Now , on the other side of "the good side" ( lol) ..when this Ratio Value is green ...and getting higher and higher by the minute ...watch your 5 min chart ...something is happening on ur EUR or GBP or JPY pair ...time to push the "brakepad" ...and switch your Time Frame to TF15  
or even TF30 ..I am watching this , just like a speedmeter ....red ..will not drive you nowhere ...green on the road again ...beware speed limit.

if we change TF then we also need change parametres in EA because distance of candle changes,I am right?

In my opinion, the best function to be added to Trio dancer EA is a total profit target.(Since I do not beleive that this robot will work without blowing an account if you let it run days and weeks and monhts...)  
  
I want to set the EA run without giving attention to weekends or news with a target of specific amount of dollars. Either it blows the 500 or doubles it.  
  
_This is different than the daily target function._ In this function, I am aiming to set the EA run with initial capital e.g. 500 dollars and tell the robot stop trading and close all orders reaching just after 500 dollars profit. Then I can wait another good time for running the EA again.  
  
In this way, I am planning to pass minimum amount of time in the market; May be 2 days, or 3 then leave after doubling my account for withdrawing my initial capital.  
  
Then I set the robot again for another 500 dollars. This is a Blow or double strategy.  
  
By doing that with the information of the robot is successfull 80% or 90 percent of the times, If I win 500 dollars 8 times and lose my all capital 2 times in 10 Robot runs:  
  
500 x 8= 4500 Dollars win  
500 x 2= 1000 Dollars loss (Of course, you will not lose that much if you put only 500 dollars in your account; Probably you will be stopped out after losing 80% of your capital)  
  
= 3500 dollars of profit after 10 runs of the robot. If things go bad, then you can get probably 2500 dollars in 10 runs. 

There are no weapons that will form against my financial prosperity.

Exactly.  
The problem with this EA always was the exit (not regarding amount target or daily target)!  
It always has lots of positions open, in floating drawdown, and when you want to close them you have to wait... that means you need much time before you are out of the market.  
Birpinars idea is good, since you can manually select market conditions; it would be an advantage to switch between total amount and daily target (or combine).  
i think (the person no ones name speaks loud) had the intention to add a hedging function for the exit, though I don't know how that shall work.  
But for sure there must be a solution for it, not letting a big floating drawdown appear at some wrong time.

You are correct about the floating drawdown but my backtests shows that if you enter a market after an account blows up, then it'll double your account the next.(equity=balance)  
  
You can wait an account blow up in your demo to enter with real money. This is good timing for running the EA.  
  
With that information you have given, we need a total profit target with an if Equity= Balance.  
if equity=balance and given target profit reached, then close all orders immediately. 

There are no weapons that will form against my financial prosperity.

I understand that we need ranging market for EA to be succeful,not trending without pullbacks.I am right?maybe need some volatility dasboard to chose pairs,and need avoid news,however dasbord will show only history not future

Which lotsize would you suggest for a 500 dollar account? I just backtested your theory with a 500 dollar account and 0.5 lots. You need atleast 0.5 lots to get close to doubling your account within a week if trading with 1 pair.   
  
The result is more like 8 weeks blowup and 2 weeks double.   
  
Did you test this?

Volatility, yes, it is just the past, not the future, but <https://www.myfxbook.com/forex-market/volatility> is quite helpful.  
Integrating such a dashboard into mt4 and even connecting it with EAwould be an advantage

Good question, I only know the one stefdek submitted and pipbeastfx 1.9 until now.  
Of course I would suggest to use the one from stefdek, since 1.9 will expire later or sooner, and we do not have the settings it has adopted already.  
But I have not looked at the other ones, so maybe there is a more preferable version in the thread (?) 

Check page 1 for all infos...

According to my experiences, we should not let the ea run when the market is around 58 period moving average on 1H. Because that moving average acts like a decision point in the market, So if market suddenly leaves 58 period and leave you you with a short around 58 moving average and moves up quickly then the Ea continues to short to secure its previous trades and the result is a huge drawdown. But when the market is far away from that moving average (120 or more pips), you have higher chance to win since the 58 period will be acting as a center of gravity and make the market move up and down for a long time and even if it goes a little more up, it still has a chance to come down again to secure your trade and vice versa if it goes down.  
Every pair has its own structure but distance of the market from 58 moving average for each pair will give you idea about where to run the Ea more securely. Market tries to keep distance between the highs & lows and 58 Period Moving average.  
  
I personally use  
58 moving average smoothed and applied to Typical Price HLC/3 on 1H. Waiting for the market go far away from that line 120-130 pips and run EA. That gave me better results.

I use this one and the settings.  
Looking forward to seeing your results.  
  
Attention: This is the setting for 500 dollar Blow or double test.  
  
and they are not the settings when I run ea far away from 58 moving average. When I run with 58 moving average I chose minimum risk settings. Please adjust them personally.

hi to everyone, i recoded the ea into more friendly code, also i isolate the engines and set my custom engine (the code keep the original conditions commented), just only basic conditions, maybe will be better change the conditions to more advanced signals, also added added max drawdown option, this is the results with the standard parameters 2017-12-01 - 2018-01-31, initial balance 1000$ to almost 4000$ in two months and 50% max drawdown, i think if withdraw a percent of balance every period like days or weeks, the risk will be minimized because this blow the account for sure in any moment, if anyone can help me to get profit with initial balance of 100$ i will be happy, i hope this will help us and thanks in advance, excuse me my english.

Wow, this is so cool! I have a very specific hedge function that could be added. I have it from another member on FF. He said its ok to forward. He wanted to make some additional adjustments, but I think its fine. Do you think you could code a hedge into it?

I liked the option of chosing a lotsize though. Now its in percentage.   
  
Other options I thought were helpful are trading time with (true/false)   
The hedge function  
Stop trading with certain amount of profit a day  
  
The hedge function is complicated, but genius!

> Can this Ea consistently make profits for you? - diffenitly yes. No 100% automatic trading, no trading in the night Quiq tp, human decide when start new series of trades. Look on TMS system H4 , for market direction and trends. Trade 1-3 pairs at all with this Ea, no more than 2 pairs in the same time. Make a plan for the month, what tp need for the day, week, month. What time to trade, what pair. For ex today no any trade on EG, coz soon bank cash rate gbp. So plan your work. This is not hobby, this must be work.

Here I will discuss the idea for hedging.  
Many ideas have been discussed before. Example, when DD for the pair hits $-100, open opposite pair equal to the total amount of lots of previous trades.  
This idea is no good because if the market begins to turn, you will be in worse position than before.  
The idea I will discuss is called Damage Recovery.  
Take a look at the above chart. GBPUSD is currently in 200 pip downtrend. I started with 0.01 lots with 1.1 exponent.  
When we hit a down trend, we shouldn’t panic and try to open a buy order that will be equal to the total amount of previous trades. If you open a 1 lot buy order, this is a big risk because of what I mentioned before.

In the image above, I have circled the biggest problem for us now in the downtrend. The trades which are furthest away from the current market price. These are causing the biggest problem because they are so many pips away from the market and most difficult to recover. These trades are the ones we must target.  
So the idea is that when the EA triggers recovery mode, for example, $-100, the EA begins to hedge and first targets the first 5 trades. So the EA opens a hedge trade which is 3x the amount of the first 5 trades. So if the first 5 trades total 0.05, then the initial hedge trade will be 0.15. So in the above chart, we will have a 0.15 SELL trade open when the recovery mode is activated.  
HOWEVER, this is the most important part, the EA MUST CONTINUE opening BUY trades as normal in the downtrend. Otherwise we will have a big gap of no trades and just be in a big loss waiting for market to turn. No matter what happens, the market will eventually turn so we need to have trades close to that turn.  
If we can get rid of the first 5 trades, then look at the chart now:

Now there is less distance for the market to recover for us. We have removed a good amount of DD as well now.  
The next step is when we have removed the first 5 trades, if the market continues in downtrend and makes a new lower low, we open another SELL order targeting the next 5 trades at the top of the trend. So this time the total lots of these 5 trades is 0.1, so we open 3x this amount, so we basically open 0.3 Sell order.

By opening hedge trades in this way, we are safe even if the market turns and begins to recover because the normal martingale trades will cover the hedge trades.  
If the next 5 trades are recovered, then again we are keeping the distance to recovery in check. Chart will look like this now:

Last post.   
  
My idea is to also add a hedge option that is more than the original hedge size. Say 3 steps of the hedge above and then if the price keeps falling a major hedge bigger than the original orders.   
  
There are different ways to hedge. Here is 1 example. Dont really know if these are good ideas and how to integrate them into this EA though.  
  
1.  
1 lot buy order, drawdown 50 pips  
At 50 pips drawdown execute a 1.2 lot sell order  
diff is now 0.2 sell lots  
This stops further drawdowns and slowly recovers losses if market keeps falling.  
  
You can wait for the market to fall further and the hedge sell will equal the buy order.  
  
2.  
Say you are -50 pips. Hedge the position like above. If position moves back direction profit, close the hedge at say -30 pips of the original hedge position.   
Don't know if that is clear?

An idea for hedging.  
  
Hedge the hedged order with the lots proportional to the pip difference to the first hedge order and with partial closing.  
  
For example; There are 5 buy orders(0.1lots) that is not closed and market goes down.6. buy order will be openning with 0.6 lot sell order.Then market goes up for example 20 pips,new hedge of hedge order will be openning with 1.2 multiply factor (0.72 lot) buy order with partial closing   
function.And if we predict minumum target profit also so loosing will be hard.  
  
İ hope ı could tell what ı mean.

So if after the first hedge the price moves back up the buy hedge will take profit for the 20 pips recovery zone. Is that what you mean? And why partial closing?  
  
Also what if the market turns down again? When to exit the second hedge? Why not just exit the first hedge and open a buy order of 0,2 instead.   
  
If someone could elaborate?

On options we shall predict like that;hedge after for example 0.5 lot so opened 0.6 lot sell hedge order.After back up EA will open normal sell orders ok.On that time it will take the profits of partial closed hedge order.And when the difference of buy and sell orders lots becomes over 0.5 lot it willopen new hedge order.EA will close all orders when total profit ofthe chart ( total with closed orders) comes to predicted value.This value must not be too much.So loosing will be hard.

Ok, this sounds like a very interesting hedge strategy and I really want to get it. Thanks for trying to make me understand!   
  
So hedge after 0.5 lot. 0.6 sell hedge is open. Price moves up 20 pips and now ?   
  
can you give an example?

0.72 lot buy hedge lot will be opened by the EA.And if prices go up again.İf we set partial closing pips for hedge orders as 10 pips for example after 10 pips going up 0.36 lot of buy hedge order will be closing ok.Then on chart there will be 0.6 lot first hedge sell order + new openning EA's order(total 0.7 lot sell order) and 0.36lot buy order+0.5 lot previosly openned buy orders.When prices goes up again EA will open sell orders and closing buy orders ok.And on that occassion if sell order number passes 0.5 lot new hedge order will be openned as 0.6 lot buy order.On inverse condition if prices go down new hedge orders will be openned so the loss will be restricted.And if we aim little profit for the chart considering closed orders profit also we can success to get profit with little risk and with more possibility.

Yes, this is o good approach which is also smart money management with any grid or martingale... . Good share my friend. Discipline will be the problem here.  
If I run 3 or 4 round successfull..."my weak humanity" lol ...will be tempted to double initial lots ...going for more ( greed ) ...thus maybe loosing 2 or 3 times in a row ..altering the plan . Then , the "revenge" against the market ...it happened 3 times in a row...thne can´t happened a fourth time right ...so , let´s start with 0.05 ...ad you are done. So, YES , 100% with you , a plan , discipline . And Trio is a winner ...

Hi Bulli ,  
  
any version here is good to be backtested...they are just the same with different fancy names ... test on demo USDJPY 5Min Time Frame first ...watch the EA surfing ...when you are fine ...add EURGBP or EURCHF...so , you are not to much exposed on a currency ... like in a selection of USDJPY / GBPJPY or EURGBP EURJPY....

Thank you for sharing this open EA.  
Just a couple queries. How should i adjust the lot size in percentage (eg. if I want to add 0.10 would it be 10% of the original lot size 0.01?)  
I reckon you mentioned about change condition to more advance signal. May I request to add the daily target option as I think it is quite important to control our trade appetite without over trading?  
  
Thanking in advance for your support & contribution.

Hi Falanca , thanks for landing here. To "hedge the hedge" is a nice concept , since we are working together here on a grid/martingale , everyone should know that this is a marvel when pair is ranging . Now , when this pair starts trending without small pullbacks , this is an account killer ...Bmcgow suggested to hedge when at early stage ( not too early though) ...problem is: hedge is an account killer in a ranging market. So the idea of hedging the hedge is very interesting.  
  
Bmcgowra: I know what you mean , the 2 or 3 farest pairs with 0.01 0.01 0.02 .... are really ...huge amount of pips away from actual market price , and I remember  
that when demo trading another grid few weeks ago , I had to intervene manually to closes theses big pips loosers , which means using the heaviest position in profit  
to close the loosers... ( Ex: 1st step 0.01 @-7$, 2nd step 0.01 @-5.80$ 3rd step 0.02 @-8$ ...and using your winning 0.11 level @ +21$ to close those 3 loosers ..all this manually with hours of monitoring sometimes 3/4pairs at the same time .....this is extremely time & nerves consuming. Hedge,ok ...Hedge the Hedge,better.  
  
Falanca, can you "picture/draw" your idea ?

No Pete ..this is an EA I found on the web ...I renamed it with fancy names ... Could ave been RINGMASTER EA : 3 strategies a) Tyson b) Ali c) Foreman .  
Pipbeast unfortunately was not clear from the beginning of his test for obvious reasons. He wanted to hook-up posters there ,asking for suggestions , asking for backtests , special needs , etc... picking up ideas from posters to make a final PRODUCT ( for sale). Version here is free ...with editable mq4 , no expiry , but still  
lacks the tweaks made on pipbeastfx V1.9 that were all demo users request. Final product is good , tailor fitted. Problem is : the seller in not trustable anymore.  
  
He can still sell you a never expiry version ...with an expiry hidden inside its code. Or selling you v1.9 for 199$ ...and v2.0 with example Hedge version for another  
additional 299$ , and ...V2.1 ...etc. Here we are trying to get slowly our own TrioX ea ..mq4

If you could add this hedge function? We could experiment and see what works. If you have time you could try the other hedge functions as well and see what works?   
  
1.  
Total Draw down is for example 1 lot buy order, drawdown is -10% of account.  
At that point execute equal hedge sell order of 1 lot and an additional sell order of 0.2 lots.  
diff is now 0.2 sell lots. This stops further drawdowns and slowly recovers losses if market keeps falling.  
  
You can wait for the market to fall further and the hedge sell will equal the buy order.  
  
2.  
If price turns back up close both hedges if DD is at -8% of account. Now lost 2%. Open an additional buy order to equal the lost 2%. Close at same point of last TP target of the sequence.

> In my opinion, the best function to be added to Trio dancer EA is a total profit target.(Since I do not beleive that this robot will work without blowing an account if you let it run days and weeks and monhts...) I want to set the EA run without giving attention to weekends or news with a target of specific amount of dollars. Either it blows the 500 or doubles it. This is different than the daily target function. In this function, I am aiming to set the EA run with initial capital e.g. 500 dollars and tell the robot stop trading and close all orders...

I reckon you mentioned about change condition to more advance signal. May I request to add the daily target option as I think it is quite important to control our trade appetite without over trading? Thanking in advance for your support & contribution.

> Ignored

the lot size means for example if you have a balance of 1000$ and set this parameter to 10 the ea init the cycle with the 10% of your balance in lots, the increment lot means for example if you set this to 30 is equal to set 1.3, 20 is equal to 1.2, in the trio ea, i just only dont like double in parameters.  
  
this have the daily target profit included, close all position when target is hit, only open new orders in the next day.

Hi xjhamil,  
  
Thank you so much for your help. I will try testing it next week onwards and share my result to you all later.  
  
Keep up the good job.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f64f.png?v=15.1)

Yeah, i get what you mean stefdek, which is why I'm thankful you open this thread sharing with others. I did approach to pipbeast initially when I realised he has abandoned his thread. He gives me the new activated EA but is in v1.7 instead.  
  
Again he never mentioned if this has any new expiry so I can only continue test in demo with more aggressive by leverage up to 0.10 lot size but set daily target of $100 only. It was working fine in the beginning but somehow the daily target seem not working resulting my account over trading despite already hit target $100. I ended up loosing $1000+ in just one day (as refer to chart).  
  
I bet he is expecting me to approach him again for a better version of his EA...with some cost incurred of course. He could have been more straightforward earlier and perhaps some might willing to pay somehow

hi, i coded the hedge function into the ea, also i added the hour filter, i removed trailing stop, expire filter because seems irrelevant.  
to configure the hegde function just only set after what level the hedging will begin, for example to activate the hedging after the third loss order just only set this parameter to 3 and 0 to disable. in the optimizer the results are better without hedging. but this need to be test, the increment factor for hedging is the same as lot increment, for now i will continue testing.

These are the parameters:  
**Step Size in Pips** => This is the grid size, for example, if is set to 3 it will open a trade at every 3 pips  
**Take Profit in Pips** => The ea calculate a global take profit in pips based on this parameter  
**Lot Percent** => The base lot size at init of cycle, if its set to 0 mean the minimum lot, if not calculate the percent of balance specified.  
**Lot Increment Percent** => This is the exponent factor, this control the lot size increment, also control the hedging lot increment,  
for example if you set to 30 is equal to set 1.3 in the trio or pipbeast ea, i just only dont like double in parameters.  
**Daily Target in Money** => When its 0 is disabled, this control the daily profit, when hit all orders are closed until the next day.  
**Hedge After Level** => This will init the hedging after this especified level, for example it its set to 3, it will init hedging after the third loser order.  
**Ini Hour** and **End Hour** => Time Filtering only open orders at specified range of time, to disable set to 0 both parameters,   
for example if you need to trade 10:00 - 14:00, set ini=10 and end=13, or if you need to trade 22:00 - 04:00, set ini=22 and end=3.  
  
Hope this helps.

> hi, i coded the hedge function into the ea, also i added the hour filter, i removed trailing stop, expire filter because seems irrelevant. to configure the hegde function just only set after what level the hedging will begin, for example to activate the hedging after the third loss order just only set this parameter to 3 and 0 to disable. in the optimizer the results are better without hedging. but this need to be test, the increment factor for hedging is the same as lot increment, for now i will continue testing. here the mql file {file}

Hi Yamil , thank you again for being with us here...Your grid builder is amazing ...and I can see you are quite quick to build modification/addition requested here to your  
XBest.Well this thread is about Trio-Something but it is also about Grid ..I will backtest your EA with tick data ...with some levels of equity protection though.

Hi stefdek, thanks and i very grateful for you sharing the ea, but mine is the same trio ea i just only change the engine conditions.  
  
**From this:**  
### First Engine ###  
if(iHigh(NULL,0,1)>iLow(NULL,0,2)&&iRSI(NULL,PERIOD_H1,14,PRICE_CLOSE,1)>30.0) long_condition=true;  
if(iHigh(NULL,0,1)<iLow(NULL,0,2)&&iRSI(NULL,PERIOD_H1,14,PRICE_CLOSE,1)<70.0) short_condition=true;  
### Second Engine ###  
if(iClose(NULL,0,1)>iClose(NULL,0,2)) long_condition=true;  
if(iClose(NULL,0,1)<iClose(NULL,0,2)) short_condition=true;  
### Third Engine ###  
if(iClose(NULL,0,1)>iClose(NULL,0,2)&&iRSI(NULL,PERIOD_H1,14,PRICE_CLOSE,1)>30.0) long_condition=true;  
if(iClose(NULL,0,1)<iClose(NULL,0,2)&&iRSI(NULL,PERIOD_H1,14,PRICE_CLOSE,1)<70.0) short_condition=true;  
**To This:**  
if (iOpen(NULL,0,0)>iMA(NULL,0,3,0,MODE_EMA,PRICE_OPEN,0)) long_condition=true;  
if (iOpen(NULL,0,0)<iMA(NULL,0,3,0,MODE_EMA,PRICE_OPEN,0)) short_condition=true;  
  
Also i dont use 3 engines at the same time, just only one instance.  
anyone can change the conditions engine, i see that conditions engine are very very basic,  
maybe is better to change to some advanced conditions and filtering.  
the heart of ea are the grid algorithm that is the same as recoded.

Hi Yamil ,  
  
These are the parameters:  
  
**Daily Target in Money** => When its 0 is disabled, this control the daily profit, when hit all orders are closed until the next day.  
Is this the daily target of that pair where EA is attached to ?? What if I run 2 or 3 pairs ...my daily target of let say 50$ is reached but I have  
one pair with 35$ in negative ...does this function close all ??  
  
  
**Ini Hour** and **End Hour** => Time Filtering only open orders at specified range of time, to disable set to 0 both parameters,  
for example if you need to trade 10:00 - 14:00, set ini=10 and end=13, or if you need to trade 22:00 - 04:00, set ini=22 and end=3.  
ok. EA will start trading 10:00 ( GMT? , broker time , local time ?) EA will stop trading 14:00 means , will NOT take anymore new entries ? or will  
not taking anymore level steps if position is in DD ? Please confim that at least EA is still monitoring open trades and opning new levels.  
  
Thank you Pal.

Hi stefdek.  
  
The daily target is calculated and filtered per symbol (pair or currency) and magic number, it means if you run in 2 or 3 pairs it calculate the profit separately,  
even if you have another ea in the same symbol, it calculate separately because are not the same MagicNumber.  
  
The time filter is calculated based on broker time, its only allow or deny open a new cycle. if its in already cycle the ea continue monitoring and  
opening new levels or hedging until the cycle is closed. i not close inmediately because some orders can be losers. maybe here need more tuning.

I would recommend everyone to first go through a period of testing for a couple of months. Learn money management, strategy and most important how to deal with your own mind before going live. But then its your money! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f913.png?v=15.1)

I just wanted my USA buddies to know there is an option for you to hedge and get leverage as high as 1000 to 1

Out of curiosity I have put this thing onto a chart (demo), and lo and behold, after some time it made like 3%. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1) However, as I watched it doing its thing it became obvious that it does not trade with the trend, at least not with the trend on the chart, which is not good because it got too much into trouble all along.

Hi Pipster , thank you for offering this to us here , you are welcome here to share your ideas ... Maybe you should contact Yamil. Now, with a Grid or Marti , trend is NOT  
really our friend ...this kind of strategy works better in ranging markets....and if a trend exists ..then we are looking for a small pullback to close the basket.  
  
By the way , I think it would be easy to add a BE ( Breakeven) setting to your Xbest ...  
  
Look to close basket @ BE after level X reached , can you do this mod quickly ?  
  
Another great mod would be an user defined lot size ,no percentage , no zero...just plain 0,01 or whatever user decides to risk. This is because as equity/balance is building up ...XBest will increase 1st entry position by percentage of balance , so instead of risk fading with a bigger account , we just stay as exposed as when starting. Example : With a 5,000$ demo account When set to ZER , it will take 0,01 ...when set to 1%...it will start with 0,05 lots ...which I do not want.

Hi Rockit , yes ...maybe a 200 MA looking to Daily chart would filter buy or sell starting cycle.

Xbest is not mine...I know what hedging and trending are...I've seen many traders try and fail with grid and martingale systems. Unless you monitor them... it's kind of like chasing the Holy Grail

Ok, so why were you looking @ Pipbeast thread ea , if you are more a trend trader ? Just curious.  
  
I may tell you that myself I do not trust (so much) Grid´s or Marti. With theses, it is quite hard to find "sleep good night" level . I am more looking at this  
as a tool ...at some point to reverse a DD ...when a signal is still valid but in DD ... this is just a thought.

Thanks a lot for such detailed response. Much appreciated. I changed Minimum Lot from 0 to 1 and then 10. Thats why, no transaction opened. Now its fine.

An idea again.  
  
On Xbest EA can we add a new cycle after some pips on hedge triggered.By the way we ll go on take profits and also first cycles will have possibity to get more profit.

this is because the grid algorithm, for example if cycle begin with uptrend open a buy order and set the take profit, if take is hit it will close and init a new cycle.  
but if its goes countertrend(downtrend in this case) open another buy order and set a new global take profit, its happen at every step until the global take profit hit.  
this grid algorithm not set stoploss because at every step in oposite direction open a new order in the same direction as the previous order.  
  
just as curiosity, you can set a take profit even with loses not only gains, but only in special cases, if you see your chart the take profit for the bottom sell orders have losses thats will be covered by gains of your top sell orders.

hi friends, i will continue the ea development, i separate the config for lot size, now you can choose the lot size mode between fixed lot and percent lot,  
also you can set your custom magic number.  
  
now you can set the signal for init a new signal with a custom moving average, which you can set the timeframe, period, mode, applied price and shift.  
i fixed the bug when no trades are open when you use in two charts or more.  
  
here the the ea. hope this helps and enjoy!

Hi rodolfolm,  
  
Thank you for your contribution to this thread. But I think you have missed the latest version from xjhamil whereby he too has added some new features (page 10).  
  
Could you please incorporate your features into his latest version?   
  
This should be interesting, now that we have 2 coders working side by side.

a) BUTTONS : - Start Sell / Start Buy / Close all - This will allow you to start your grid whatever strategy/system or indicator you want to follow , close all applied only  
on specified magic# , so you close your grid when you think this is enough WIN , BE , or DD  
b) ONE TRADE PER CANDLE : so, your grid will be different if EA applied on TF5 TF15 TFH1 ...and EA "looking" at chart TF  
  
c) GRID with pending orders : This one will need pictures or drawings .. Will try here to describe with words ; Grid/Martingale likes ranging markets when price consolidates , Marti´s do not like trending markets.To make explanation as clear as possible I will suppose our grid started SELLING ...while we already bagged few pips today with the ups and the downs ...suddenly ...while SELLING at level 4 ( selectable) we have 0,01/0,01/0,02/0,03 expecting a few 7 or pips DOWN to close the  
grid and rince and repeat ...an UPTREND is forming ...strong...We say Sh**t ...we know that this strong UPtrend will quickly reach next sell positions 0,05 / 0,08 / 0,11 ...etc.... . So , instead of having a full loaded and heavy basket with all those 0,01 ...0,03 ...0,11....heading to the sky with DD increasing by the minute without  
knowing where UPTREND is going to stop ... I suggest that from user definable level Ex : level 5 ...will open only a SELL STOP ...5 pips ( selectable) BELOW current price ...so the next one level 6 : 0.08 SELL STOP 5 pips below the actual price ...and so on.  
  
We will then have only 0,01 / 0,01/ 0,02 / 0,03 in DD far away from actual price ....with 2 SELL STOPs ready to be triggered when price is coming back "home" ...personally I can stand 7 levels feeling relax ..but , as price is keeping moving away from the 1st position and reaching the 8th pos...I need to look at the chart  
every 15 min..load indicators ...and throwing some TAROT cards or VooDoo bones on the table ( lol ) to know what kind of death skull we might soon face.  
  
So, with the SELL STOPS in place ( one or 2 might be triggered before trend continues ) ...this will NOT be the whole basket driving the HELL´S BELLS highway.  
( thank you AC/DC).  
  
When trend stops , and the expected pullback or retrace is coming and starting to move DOWN ( in the example above we are SELLING in an uptrend) ...it will be QUITE easy to close the Basket with the most heavylot size , let´s say 0,84 positive 114$ ...while our thiny first 3 or 4 positions ALLTOGETHER have only minus 32$.  
  
As of myself , when basket is at level 7 or 8 ...all I want is to get out at BE.  
  
I will try to draw this -out of the box- concept "on paper" tomorow ...  
  
Have to sleep now.

Thanks. You do have a point with the Taro card thing! Lol  
I like your suggestion, but what if the sell stops get activated and the market again turns up?  
  
This is why I suggested the hedge of the entire basket, with a recovery zone.  
  
Say the basket is at -50 pips DD from 1st entry. At that point hedge all and set hedge SL at -40 pip DD of first entry of basket. Add the -10 pips to new position of basket to be recovered at exit of entire sequence.

Hello rodolfolm, Thanks for your revised version. Can you please check about panel color? I am unable to change it or remove it, because of this color, I cannot see on the left sides of open positions, either these are buy or sell.  
  
Thanks in advance

You got a point but hedging is also setting difficult target to achieve in this EA. Check TP level which EA needs to close all positions.   
  
Martingale with hedging can be possible but we are here to find the best way and two awesome coders we have to help us.

That will be great if we have emergency buttons on the chart to close entire basket or close all trades of that particular pair.

In my opinion, this can be dangerous because every candle has different length and gaps will be so big and GAP between each trade and will be difficult to get global profit. Kindly disregard if I could not grasp your idea :-)

When market coming back in our home direction, it is not guaranteed that it will retrace enough to hit our target. As bmcqowra mentioned, it an hit 2-3 sell stops and move back to opposite side leaving us in trouble. What will be our backup plan?

In my humble opinion, the best way to protect your equity, we should use professional EA. Like Equity Sentry   
[https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...2#post10511892](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=10511892#post10511892)  
  
We can simply attach this EA to any chart and can trade other EA's fear-free without adding these equity stop and draw down code in every single EA. :-)  
That's just my suggestion, you are free to disagree and my apology for the same :-)

very good suggestions, stefdek, of course they need to be tested first...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)!  
  
Especially I like the feature "**ONE** **TRADE PER CANDLE"** which makes the EA more flexible, allows using different grids in other timeframes and protects EA from taking too many (bad) positions during Red News spikes!  
  
Happy trading, jdva 

I never lose - either I win or I learn...

yes it really shuts down MT4 platform to save our balance. :-) You know, some people run MT4 on VPS and copy trades from others, this is useful for those. While sleeping, they can set a maximum loss they can afford.

I never back tested this but running on my live account since 6 months without issues. Anyhow, I dont think its difficult for coder to add this feature in every single EA unless it create issues with other features.

> Thanks. You do have a point with the Taro card thing! Lol I like your suggestion, but what if the sell stops get activated and the market again turns up? This is why I suggested the hedge of the entire basket, with a recovery zone. Say the basket is at -50 pips DD from 1st entry. At that point hedge all and set hedge SL at -40 pip DD of first entry of basket. Add the -10 pips to new position of basket to be recovered at exit of entire sequence.

Hi BMC, I apreciate that you liked my Tarot cards and Voodoo bones throwing thing...hope we will not have to go for the Virgins of Antic Greece or sacrifice any animals in the "guessing" .  
  
This said , I am quite null/nada/zero with the hedge stuff you are familiar with and hammering from the beginning. Thank you for this , nail is now in the wood and present in new EA version .This is basicly the spirit of this thread , adding features to have OUR grid system open source and custom fitted with our trading style.  
  
To understand the Hedge stuff I need to see it running on a chart. I did not tested YET any of the new XBest ea with Hedge function ON.  
  
Now we will all apreciate here if you can share screenshots of your MT4 with Hedge activated ...and final results of a cycle that includes this Hedge feature ...is this possible ?  
  
Thank you

Hi Kashif Same here .  
  
@ Rodolfo : can you allow your GUI to be shifted corner 1,2,3, or 4 option ?  
  
on my MT4 build 1090 when selecting "cor de fundo" to no color ..there is still a grey backgroung color showing and masking buy/sell positions.

Martingale, grid, hedge are functions that help us correct wrong entries.  
  
I therefore think we should also focus on the entry of trades. Higher time frames seem more reliable and maybe some good indicators as well.  
  
If the EA looks at the higher time frames like 1H and 4H as well.

Hi Bmcgowra,  
  
Thank you for EA and help you provided here. I have loaded the EA with FFCAL indicator and DLL is on but it is not picking up any order. Do i have to change the magic# every time or it is ok to have same # on different currencies. Can you provide the time on which we have to load it? I have loaded on GA, EU, EJ,EG and AU all are on 5mnts chart. Please provide set file. Thank you.

Try to increase Maximum Spread from 10 (1pip ) to 25 (2.5 pips)  
  
Mostly brokers have spread between 1 to 2 pips

ok. This function could of course be optional - TRUE/FALSE . But I will show you below what happened with Trioxxx/Pbeast/Orchestra these days with the USDJPY.  
130 pips ...with no significant retracement...TrioOrchestra ...14 levels.... as this ea has 3 buid-in strategies ..I had 2 buy cycle running DOWN the hill... max DD was  
86%..on demo ...uuff. lol. Now , if you look at the xBest EA which I started testing recently on EURGBP only and unless YAMIL can explain better the "engine" he is using ...I could only see it is a _simple grid normal pip distance_ staging and with Xbest on this USDJPY ...@ 5 pips distance , factor 1.5 and 130 pips ...would have made my demo account flat dead today with 26 levels.

YEEESSSS , correct wrong entries ....using as a tool ...this is why I asked for the "buttons" ...you can even trade the ZigZag ...which repaints ... as case in picture  
below ...you can go Short ...pressing the XBest EA button SELL and this will start our sell grid ... ( ...just check others indi´s before ..) lol.  
  
You can apply this grid to almost ANY manual strategy when you´r entering your position ...

Maybe we could create a list of the best none repainting indicators?  
  
Like trade with Indicator  
1 (true/false)  
2 (true/false)  
3 (true/false)  
4 (true/false)  
5 (true/false)  
6 (true/false)  
  
All just ideas. Up to the programmers of course. If you select 2 of the 6 the trade only executes if both are in alignment.

If you select 2 of the 6 the trade only executes if both are in alignment.

Well , this is very difficult to find a reliable one almost all indi´s repaint (or lag) ...what TF for the indi ? Just as an example a simple stochastic on a TF5min will show you an overbought while on H1 is barely going out of an oversold , and in my humble opinion , if indi´s or confirmation are accurate we should never need to grid.  
There is always this uncertainity 50/50 ...50% chance this is correct , 50% chance market has other another idea ... in the entry specifics ...I would look at other thread like the ones I am following :  
Simple Trend reversal Strategy by MRDFX : <https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=713593> or  
Volatility bt Metastock : <https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=721812>  
  
These are systems that I would use to enter with OUR Grid in backup ...but there is plenty other systems here where you could use the grid as a protection tool.

Thank you for posting this bug AND the picture ...with this picture I can explain better the Sell Stop ( or Buy Stop) function that I would like to be added in future mods.

Filters are important for martingale protection.  
In this case the filter protected from the great oscillation that had in the price. When the spread returns to normal the EA will continue the grid with fewer levels than it would have if it were off.

thanks very useful, was wondering if keep the hedge on after 5 levels and spread filter comes to act , then ive potentially 5 losing orders unhedged..(better than a lot of losing ones ,I agree ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1) )

The EquityStopFilter filter does not close all orders. When it has "EquityStopFilter ON" status it stops working on the day and if it continues ON it only opens one order a day until it leaves the drawdown.

Hi rodolfolm,  
  
As it is completely hedging, should we set a value for Hedge level? will it start double hedging?

A magicnumber1 acts on the purchase grid the other magicnumber2 acts on the sales grid in xBest V3 Hedge. It's two grids

In this peculiar case, ONE SELL per candle would have only taken 2 positions and/or selectable would have left PENDING ORDERS ...5 pips below market price...  
  
Grid Marty are potential account killers , so we have to think OUT OF THE BOX..and test new approaches.

i will separate the exponent factor for the grid and tfor the hedging, remember more exponent factor, more lots increasing and more near global take profit.

if i have time will analize the sentry ea, thats is better than actual equity filter of trio orchestra or pipbeast?  
  
i will say already this is the same trio or pipbeast ea, the grid algorithm is the same, trio or pipbeast use 3 instances with different conditions to init a cycle,  
but i only use one instance with my custom condition, the condition does not impact too much in the ea maybe is better to randomize the entries or even better manual cycle init with buttons or another advanced signaling.  
  
thanks to rodolfolm to improve the ea, we need to work together on this to improve and get more profit and less drawdown.  
i run the ea with standar settings in 3 pairs in 3 days it has made more than 2000$ of profit with base lot size of 0.01

when i have time i will code these features, just patience friends.

this will init the hedging after the especified losser orders, if you set to 3 this will init hedging after the third losser order in this case the 4 level.  
the lot size of hedging increase with the lot increment factor (exponent factor), the global take profit is the optimized level of weighted sum of orders and lots  
plus the pips from take profit parameter.

yes, but same as grid, the hedging one day can blow the account in a range market. but this is the case of my hedging implementation,  
here the ea need improvements.

Maybe exit after level 5 and initiate a recovery loss strategy.

Another sequence optoin beside Martingale is as an option to trade with would be nice as well.   
Fibonacci: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89   
Or 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10

[quote = rodolfolm; 10778011]我做了一个完整的对冲版本，但需要改进...... {file} {file} [/ quote]  
  
Hello, rodolfolm. Thank you for your great sharing.  
  
I tested your EA, and there are several Suggestions for improvement about adding warehouse .  
  
1\. With regard to the way of adding warehouse, I think it is possible to monitor the fluctuation rate of K line and choose not to add positions regularly.  
2.The way in which a fixed position is added can lead to a lack of control in the face of big trends.  
3.As shown in the figure, the position of 1-4 does not need to be added. When the K line volatility is relatively small, add the warehouse.This can filter out a lot of invalid additions and reduce the risk.  
  
Thanks again for your great contribution.

This depends on the size of the recovery zone. Also I think at a certain point we must accept a loss and close all trade. The loss for this shouldnt be too high.

Here the instructions of the loss recovery EA I bought. If we try to implement this strategy explained in the instructions manual, I do think the loss recovery strategy is risky as we have to recover big loss. But we might be able to adjust it somehow?

Hello 12345 , thank you for posting your ideas.I do hope they might be usefull.But we might have here a language problem. I think no one understand you.  
This is maybe the reason why no one has answered you or commented your suggestions.  
  
although you are using english words ..all put together it does not make sense.Maybe you should use another translator or swap dictionnary.  
  
Your profile : Trading from USA ...chinese email just fine. A warehouse is a BIG building to store stuff. Please try to explain in other words.  
  
Don´t take me bad. I am trying to understand.  
  
"and if there is resonance, it will open the warehouse. If it is a tendency K, it will be very difficult to appear" ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1) ..maybe Steve Howking can answer you.

the idea here is only ONE position per candle IF pipdistance has been reached ...if we set pip distance let say 7 pips ...if candle close ...4 or 6 pips away from 1st ( or 2ndo , third, etccc) the EA will not open a new position. New position opened will have to be at least 7 pips away from last position and will be opened at NEXT candle  
opening. When backtesting this prior to release ...you will see that results will be VERY different acording to Time Frame tested . In a "normal" grid fixed spacing or ATR  
ADR based ...results are equal on TF5 TF15 TFH1 .....his will be amazingly different.

> {quote} Here I will discuss the idea for hedging. Many ideas have been discussed before. Example, when DD for the pair hits $-100, open opposite pair equal to the total amount of lots of previous trades. This idea is no good because if the market begins to turn, you will be in worse position than before. The idea I will discuss is called Damage Recovery. Take a look at the above chart. GBPUSD is currently in 200 pip downtrend. I started with 0.01 lots with 1.1 exponent. When we hit a down trend, we shouldn’t panic and try to open a buy order that...

@rodolfolm: There are very interesting comments from bmcgowra see Posts 114- 119, how to avoid big drawdowns. Do you see a possiblity to integrate his ideas into your ea. Would be fine if you would let us know. Thans and best regards, renkotop

I think its best to have a function that closes all trades if certain DD is reached. Either in percent, money or pips.

Thanks for sharing but somehow I cannot get it to take orders. Does it start only when certain conditions are met? I already checked import dll. Placed the ffcal file in the indicator folder. I managed to get xjhamil's version to work quite easily.

Hi,  
Since I am quite new and I am a bit confused, could you please explain:  
xBest - is it a modified version with hedging feature of TrioDancer ?  
  
I have downloaded both EAs.  
TrioDancer_4.4.5 and xBest_V3.2  
  
Please clarify the above matter.  
Thanks and regards,  
Najmat

Can you explain a little how your hedging work? I notice when hedging comes into place, it is taking more lots in the opposite direction than the current orders. Also if the trend reverse in the opposite direction of the hedge, then the loss will be more significant.

Hello Rodolfolm,  
  
xBest - is it a modified version of TrioDancer ? Or is it totally different programs ?  
Appreciate very much your clarification.  
  
Thanks and regards,

Hi Guys,  
  
Does anyone tested that Daily Target option? I'm not sure if is really functioning as I leverage up my lot size and lower my target profit to $60 only hoping to achieve my target sooner.   
Today I have a trade that profited $128 but the EA still continue trading. I do not think these are earlier open pending trades coz the time of those trades taken were quite fresh about 5 mins gap only.  
Can anyone kindly advise on this feature, will it close all open trades when daily target has achieved? I'm using the xbest V2.1, btw.  
Rodolfolm or Xjhamil?

The broker has rules. SL can not be less than X TK can not be less than X etc ... that influences the opening of orders.  
Checks if you are giving logbook error.

I tried another EA and YES it also happens on the activtrade broker, they put a SL so that I can not see it without reducing to see well above or below the current price

And you add Hedge after level 5. this adds SL in the orders. Try to clear this parameter.

Hi All, Thanks for EA.  
My understanding about xBest 2.2, it open the order only one direction (buy or sell) then using martingale.  
After that, the opposite order will be open when reaching the level set in variable "hedge" for recovery. is that correct?  
  
However, in xBest 3.2 that I have just done the backtest for USDJPY from 1/11/2017-13/02/2018 using hedging, it open both direction.  
Don't know how the hedging concept is. May you explain the concept of full hedge for this version?   
  
Attached is the result I did the backtest of xBest 3.2.

Greetings to all! I just subscribed to this thread a week ago, and have seen some interesting comments/ideas shared by many of you.  
  
I downloaded the Pipbeast 1.9 EA from Post #28 (by AndrewBa-), and decided to put it on a Demo trading account, running on 28 pairs with $100K starting capital, I started the test at 2am GMT on 15 Feb, and now it's 34 hours later, the account has a 67% profit (after deducting floating drawdown), which is quite an impressive feat!   
  
Check [https://www.forexfactory.com/windcha....43-tab.report](https://www.forexfactory.com/windchaser#acct.43-tab.report)  
  
I will let it run for another week or two, to find out has the best performance, will share the results and settings in this thread, in due time.  
  
For those respected members here, to help the new readers, can someone list down the feature/logic differences between these EAs?  
1\. Pipbeast 1.9  
2\. TrioDancer 4.4.5  
3\. xBest 3.2  
  
Thank you all who contributed, we are all here for the same reason, let's help one another to achieve greater financial growth! 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

However, in xBest 3.2 that I have just done the backtest for USDJPY from 1/11/2017-13/02/2018 using hedging, it open both direction. Don't know how the hedging concept is. May you explain the concept of full hedge for this version? Attached is the result I did the backtest of xBest 3.2. {image}

Version xBest 3.2 uses two engines. One only for purchase and another only for sale. These engines exchange information among themselves for shield and attack in the price war.

Thanks Rodolfolm. As your explanation that 2 engines exchanges information for shield and attack, does it mean I don't need to set the Hedge level?

Yes! the EquityCaution parameter is the trigger for exchanging information for Shield and Attack  
  
if an engine enters the equitycaution it informs the other engine the size of the last batch and thus the other engine operates the reverse with the amount of lots of the first acting in favor of the trend. and vise versa.  
  
If both motors go into equitycaution they cancel and re-operate.  
  
I'm going to implement a trailing stop to get bigger gains. but may increase the size of the takeprofit for this already in this release.

Wow, your account still live in backtest for 8 years.  
I tested version 2.2 in backtest for USDJPY from 2016/2018 with hedge and no hedge, my $5000 blow up after 7 or 8 months.   
Still looking the result in which situation that hedge cannot save the account.

Thanks Rodolfolm, I have tested your ver 3 on vps with good results. Now I have replaced that with this new version. Just one question, with default setting, (except news filter off) can it survive sudden move of 150 to 200 pips without any retracement?  
  
Some EA love ranging and some love volatility. Obviously everyone looking for the EA which can survive in both. :-)

Hi Everyone,  
I was part of the Pipbeastfx thread. I loaded Xbest _ v3  
But it is not opening any trade, maybe I am missing a setting. I am back-testing it and still it is not opening any trade. I will like to Backtest it over the weekend. Any  
help is welcome.

V.3.2.  
Another backtest for USDJPY with $8000 and default setting from 1/2016, still blow out after 1 month and 8 days.  
Maybe hedging in EA not work for this pair ???

From the above testing, the EURGBP was a far better pair to trade than the USDJPY. Also remember I suddenly stop testing on Thursday the 15th. By doing this I force the EA to close ongoing trades which I believe can be winning trades if I left it to run the next day which is today Friday. Or I simply leave it open for the next week.  
Just my observation, I leave it for brighter heads to figure out.

After hedging starts, what will happen if the price starts to reverse towards the earlier orders since all earlier orders have no more T/P targets?

Here is a simple version, with the idea to close the orders when reaching the recovery zone - so maybe you could reduce the number of lots.

Tnaks for sharing these graph results here ....especially those with a reasonable 500$ starting balance , as we know that testing 1 pair with 10k is quite useless.  
What is the Time Period tested in those graphs ?? 1 week , 1 month ?

Hello friend , the only tester that can do this is here : please do a search in google as I can´t post a link.

Please note that i was looking for this tool for basket trading ...and when digging deeper I just realized that it has limitations ...as an example you can´t drop an  
EA and testing it simultaneously on 2 or more pairs ...you have to request programmers in the blog to recode your ea into an API that fits the software. Not sure  
what you are looking for ...but might be interesting to dig in. Take care.

Thank you for your midified version. But how does it work exacty? If the trade exits recovery zone then it will instantly close?

Yes.  
  
In the second picture from post # 357 ([https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...8#post10789008](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=10789008#post10789008)) I wrote the idea:  
  
_For every Buy/Sell trade:_  
  
_SL = Zone Recovery Pips_  
_TP = Zone Exit Pips + Profit Pips_  
  
You can also see that in the sheet formulas.  
  
The original system retains all orders until the finish, there is only one active trade, and the unnecessary losses are skipped.  
  
I should get a fee from the author if he takes this idea, then his system will be more efficient and he can ask for more money...  
But, I just want to try to reduce the losses _here in forum_ , if that was done by the programmer like the original one.  
  
_(I just analyzed the code, and it's actually like the original one._  
_In the excel sheet you can easily see that the lots can be reduced, and a recovery can longer survive!)_

Thank you for the explanation.  
Say a trade opens. It wil move 5 pip into recovery zone and trade closes. ? In that case SL is 5 pip? Recovery zone is 5 pip? I dont get it. Could you give an example?  
  
Looks more like the recovery zone is 5 pips on your example. ?

Hi rodolfolm, Many thanks for your EA xBest V3.3  
  
I tried to do a backtest on GBPUSD M5 using default settings but had no trades placed. I then incresed Spread to 50 and still no trades placed. Then I increased Step Size to 10 and still no trades. Any idea why this would be? All previous xBest EAs have worked fine.  
  
Thank you for any assistance

Thank you rodolfolm, Spread in backtester was set to 2. I simply closed MT4 and reopened it again. After that backtester worked. Will do forward test this week.

Thank you for the new 3.3 version!  
  
I compiled the file and corrected the cause of many warnings ("implicit conversion from 'number' to 'string' etc.")  
  
Two problems for me:  
  
\- I renamed the global variable m_spread in m_spreadX, because warning "declaration of 'm_spread' hides global declaration..."  
  
\- In the xBest function, in the "Hedging" sequence, you calculate "m_spread= Spread * m_pip"  
But this is a fix value "Spread=2.0" and not "Spread=MarketInfo(Symbol(), MODE_SPREAD)" like in the Informacoes() function.  
(In live trading we have variable [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide")).  
In the xBest function I have made no change, maybe I miss something.

Hi fellows , I made some testings on EURGBP and runned optimizations , of course thoses test who were over a ridiculous 70% DD where filtered out. I only looked  
at the ones with less then 50% ...and focused on settings with less than 35% dd with the best reward. Tested from early May 2017 to early days Feb 2018.(eight months) I could see 6 or 7 "shaky" events for the EG ...2 in May , 1 in July , 1 in August , 1 September , 1 November ... . I renamed EA Rv3.2 ( R standing for Rodolfo) so we might soon have a EA Y V3.5 ( Y for Yamil) . These tests were made with Dukascopy Tick database , extracted with Tick story lite , exported to my GP ( AUS ) Broker. I tested the EA as if on a 5min TF and on a 15 min TF ..DD were much less on TF15 in terms of R:R. Beside this , I also wanted to have a confirmation of the ONLY ONE TRADE per candle feature . By setting this ON , you have a kind of "Price Action" grid , much more adaptive to real market condition then spacing using Fixed spacing , ATR or ADR . I think that this feature also make the News filter useless ( it is useless anyway if you are already in a cycle started well before ) , with the ONE trade per candle on a TF15 ...a 90 pips move will be less aggressive with this feature ON , than with "normal" spacing approach.  
  
Testing was made on 5,000$ initial deposit ( that I would NEVER play with) ...I will soon give a go with 5,000 cents....  
  
Your comments welcome.

It's the same with 2.2 account blown... maybe because my backtest has data quality at 99% or what?

maybe you should use maxspread =5. Since your broker give 10, if it doesn't take trade, then it is your high spread that is responsible

Yes , I think that spread migth be an issue... These tests we done with a max spread of 2 pips ( quite fair on EurGbp) ...usually I get 0.9 to 1.4 from my ECN Broker.  
  
I am not using the ticks of my broker ...and market is closed , I am not an expert , but his could also affect testing data and spreads ...(maybe)..

Hi Renko , RV3.3 has just been released ...with few mods. I did not tested yet ....our Rodolfo coder is spitting new releases every 2 or 3 days and is faster than us.

Really I'd like to think that problem is spread .. (in anu case spread 0.2 for EUR/GBP is really hard to have in real trading ) bit I'm afraid tjatth difference is in data quality..   
Anybpdu here to try same setting to see differences ?

Ahh , ok ....will check this on my side later tonight ....I am running another optimization now that I can´t stop, still 2 hours to go ... you then say that if I introduce  
2 pips in my tester I should put 20 "pipettes" ... right ?. R.V3.2 working with 4 pips grid spacing , 3 pips tp and max spread 10 pips backtester engine with 20 pipettes  
I will make a re-do.

Hi, in my opinion, the xBest v2.2 is the best so far, I've tested all of them, except the v3.3, it didn't work for me, neither the v3.3.1!  
Here's my test for the xBest v2.2 on GBP/JPY (most volatile pair) with 1,000$ account (default settings), from 1st JAN to 1st FEB 2018. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f911.png?v=15.1)

I still couldn't get this EA to work in my demo account. Already disabled news filter and equity stop setting. How do I disable the spread filter?

Ficci My Fault : This test was performed with XBest V3.2 ...(carefull it is trading BOTH SIDES) .  
  
I must admit that Cescof pointed out the "spread" stuff on Strategy tester ...AND he is damn right my fault ...I will have to re-do all my optimizations , spent all weekend on this EURGBP USDJPY EURCHF GBPCHF...lol. ( anyway it was raining all these days here) . Will empty the trashbin and start all over.  
First on V2.2 which trade ONE SIDE and one position per candle ( which I need for the out of the box stuff thinking) ...then on R V3.2 ( R= Rodolfo coder).

Not sure if it's the bug in xBest_3.3 or not.  
  
I am doing backtest the version 3.3 for USDJPY from 2016-2018 but not finished yet.  
While running to Feb 2016, there is one sell order open without TP setting   
  
Looking at Journal, found error "Order Delete Error..." (attached : xBest_error.jpg)  
  
Please advise me if I may do something wrong with setting or any.

As per Error during backtest, I tried to run again and still same error, then I just stop the test.  
I tried to find out what happened. Checked the result tab for transactions which screen is attached below.  
From the result, what I am guessing that EA tried to close all pending orders.  
However, unfortunately, one pending order (sell stop #1978") suddenly open (order type become "SELL").  
  
Is it possible if it is the cause of error "**_OrderDelete error 4108_** " I encountered.?

Shame on me... My mistake.  
You are right. I forgot to change EA to test and another EA has quite similar name to xBest V3.3 (other EA like "XXX_V3.3"  
Sorry for making trouble.  
  
Now I'm testing exact EA name "xBest V.3.3". Will post the result when test completed.  
Thanks again Rodolfolm for great EA and your effort.

Just an update. I managed to get it started. It suddenly works.. Guess it is not as instant as I would expect.

Here the result testing with V.3.3, default setting, $3000 and USDJPY from 2016-2018. The test was closed when running around mid of April 2016.  
Result is similar to V.3.2. This is when EA open buy, price drop, open another buy, price drop, open another buy until margin call.  
  
For the last set of buy before closed at stop, the first buy was open at 117.542 (lot 0.01) and the last buy at 111.878 (lot 5.43). The number of buy orders in this set is 25 and TP at 112.154. They all were closed at stop at 111.141.   
  
With version 3.3, I will do more test with more money and let's see how much I can survive to year 2018.  
Seems hard to find the recovery logic for this EA but hopefully we can find it.

Hi Swingman, I still try to understand the logic here. To exit the trade at entry level means there is no recovery zone. But on your excel sheet it says the recovery zone is 50 pips? Could you explain a little more. I really would like to understand.

Thanks for sharing the result! Probably will need $10000 to survive it.  
  
Also perhaps can you try a lesser volatile pair like EURGBP?

Pnithi ..it is a grid martingale , very few settings can survive 2 years backtest ...and especially with 3,000$ on such a volatile pair.Look at your settings a Grid of 1 pip ?  
  
Start your test with fixed lot 0,01 ...do not play with the trailing function or hedge stuff till you master or have a clue on grid spacing and the daily movement of this peculiar pair on a normal day ... . I saw in your settings you did not actived 1 trade per candle Time Frame 15 minutes. And backtesting such a long period without having better settings ...will kill your account in no time.  
look here recently USDJPY - down ...almost 200 pips with no retracement . Try first from January 15 to January 30 (2 weeks) ...maybe with Grid spacing 8 pips take profit 3 pips ...factor 1.3 ... 1 trade per candle activated ...this is just a hint ..I have not tested (yet).

Thanks Stephan, I had downloaded Forex tester before and found difficult to adapt myself to it ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) I think it may take long time to do that.  
  
TRIAD PAIRS  
  
I wonder what will happen when triad pairs tested togather. Because triad pairs have equality in between.  
  
e.g  
  
eurjpy x usdjpy=eurusd  
  
and/or  
  
eurgbp x gbpusd = eurusd  
  
If we can choose first 3 or second 3 or trade all 6 togather, This may give better results I beleive.  
  
And probably will not blow in low risk settings? Since I can not test multiple pairs togather, Can somebody please test it?  
  
I started testing on a demo account but it will take long long time. So, I believe the backtesting is the way to go for now. 

There are no weapons that will form against my financial prosperity.

Thanks Stefdek for your advice.  
I know that very few setting or no any setting of martingale can survive that long period. Only one martingale trade can kill us even the first run on live account. I was killed at the first day in the forex battle field and many times after. However, still in love the martingale.   
  
If there's way to recover loss of martingale, then it would be very good for us and hoping we could find it "holygrail" here some day. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1) That's tough to do.  
  
I will continue the test with the setting you advised. Again, thanks to our coders and all here. Let make it happen!!!!

Falcon, $10000 is quite BIG....  
I will try EURGBP to see if better result than USDJPY. Thanks for advice.

You can close all trades by setting the InpCloseAllEquityLoss parameter to true  
  
I'll implement it equity stop loss in money for $  
  
Closing everyone for me is panic and a good trader has to have cold blood and discipline to get out successfully. To close all is to deliver money to the market.

Maybe you can list out all the bugs you found so as to help the coders check and fix them.

Hi guys ...here we go. Some interesting settings for EURGBP only. Tested with 15 points spread ( 1.5 pips) ...which are normal with an ECN broker ( you pay comission per lot traded to have low [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide")). If your broker is NOT ecn ...you have to backtest theses settings shared below with 35 points ( 3.5 pips spread) ...results will be VERY different. Test performed from first days of may 2017 to early days February 2018. Ticks are from Tickstory Lite.Version of the EA is RV2.2.  
( the 1st one with one trade per candle) . Time frame to drop the EA on is 15 minutes. Do NOT launch this EA on an account balance less than 5,000 cents with minimal lots 0,01 ....or if your broker has nanolots 0,001 ...you can run it with 500$ ...but are they ecn with low spreads ?

forgot to add those pictures ...so you understand the RISKS on both settings above ...and another picture with the results of the optimization where playing with  
GRID SPACING , GRID TP , GRID FACTOR appear in first 3 column on right side ....no news filter applied , no hedge , no timing , and ONE TRADE PER CANDLE (TF15).  
Remember RV2.2 trades only ONE side .....results with RV3.x ...might differ ...for better or worse results ...Will start now with testings on RV3.x ...Always EURGBP till  
I dig out better and safer settings. Then , only then I will look for another pair.

Testing V3.3 from 2016-2018 for USDJPY with $5000 and setting changed only PipStep=3, PipProfit=3 and OneCandle=true. Unbelievable, I survive.  
Even though it's not in good profit, but it's the good sign   
Thanks Rodolfolm for good EA and also thanks to stefdek for advice on setting. Anyway, I will continue study this EA to find good setting.   
  
For this**LUCKY** result, the big drawdown happened after balance up from $5000 to around $7xxx. If it happened earlier, wipe out.

Thanks for pointing out. I have already tried with $5000 and completed the run from 2016 to 2018.  
The result was posted earlier.

Agreed 90% DD is not good with 100% return in 2 years.   
As per date of DD event, 1st was around 15/2/2016 and the other was around 3/6/2016

Hi Rodolfo, thank you for these continuous updates ...you are amazing. Can you briefly explain what this Version Ilan Tarasov do ? and what are the main differences  
with your/our EA ?? . This development of your/our own EA based on strategies/ideas from Pipbeast/Ilan/TrioDancer are a great step ahead in terms of Ethics (as FerruxFx mentioned) . So, I wil ask you to not go to far from our sentry here and will ask you to gently remove the link to your paypal ( you could be banned here in no time) : "Donations welcome" is more appropriated and leave the same powerful message.  
  
Let´s first test your latest versions , found & report any bug inthere . Donations will overflow your "inbox" in no time , so we will have you here forever...lol.

> Hi guys ...here we go. Some interesting settings for EURGBP only. Tested with 15 points spread ( 1.5 pips) ...which are normal with an ECN broker ( you pay comission per lot traded to have low spreads). If your broker is NOT ecn ...you have to backtest theses settings shared below with 35 points ( 3.5 pips spread) ...results will be VERY different. Test performed from first days of may 2017 to early days February 2018. Ticks are from Tickstory Lite.Version of the EA is RV2.2. ( the 1st one with one trade per candle) . Time frame to drop the EA on...

Thats fine Cescof ...my setfile are now tested on 15 points [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") ..( 1.5 pips) ....can you run an optimization for last 9 months with 10 points spreads and share results here ? Will be helpfull to comprare ...  
  
Otimization I did returned a lot of possibilities : can you run the eight first settings with your 99% , same 10 points spread ? So , we might found EA crossing ..lol , thus our entry point if I may say like this ...

Of course i can test it .. i've good data and Vps to run test... In my opinion spread is not the problem... your result is totally different from mine with same setting.  
I'm using [activtrades](/brokers/activtrades "View ActivTrades Broker Profile") broker with 0.8-1.0 average spread so my result with your setting must be better, so i think your n/a data quality make the difference.  
Back to test, i've seen for ex there was a period in wich EUR/GBP was selled just before trend changed and from 0.71 reached 0.80 without a decent retrace so no way to survive...  
Please tell me how can help development in testing...

Tickstory / Dukascopy ticks ...should return >90% quality testing .....EG , I have ECN broker ..usually around 0.6 / 0.9 / 1.1 ...during Asian sessions it goes up to 1.6  
sometimes ..spreads fluctuates ...maybe we should consider a fixed spread broker for this strategy ...Optimize with its spreads... As the idea is to have cents account

Hi stefdek,  
I don't want to advertise any broker, but rakuten securities for example have fixed spreads fro 95% of the time (as they say); 5% when spread fluctuates is not in main trading sessions... So switching max. spread on causes disabled EA in only max. 5% of the time.  
I think xtb & [fxpro](/brokers/fxpro "View FxPro Broker Profile") also offer fixed spreads. 

Check page 1 for all infos...

I'm forward testing RV4.2 on M15 TF (thanks guys for your BT's and efforts) since yesterday evening on 11 pairs allocating about 5k/pair. Grid steps are ATR in pips-based (M15, period 3000=about 30 days), hence 8-12 pips and TP 3-6 pips. Lot multiplier = 2. One order per candle, no hedge, no trailing, no news, no time, running24/5. Earlier results are from Trio EA partly with daily targets. Max DD so far 0.87%/0.5K.

Thank you jdva , nice results ...50,000 cents would be ok.... if I would ever trade multipairs , I would never trade same currency twice something like EURGBP,AUDNZD,  
USDCAD CHFJPY ..or once a pair is engaged I would look at correlation stuff or to buy only a currency on a pair and sell on the other one Ex : BUY GBPUSD SELL GBPJPY ...if GBP is very strong for a week ...we have a potential acc blower.  
  
Take care .

@stefdek, @all: I made a lot of backtests and foreward tests and I always ran in huge DD and my account blowed up. That means to me, that the EAs in this thread are not surviving longer trends...  
  
I got now from _**bgntrs**_ the attached concept to hopefully reduce DD and hopefully the account will not blow up.  
  
I would like you to have a look about this concept and maybe xjhamil or rodolfolm could do the coding.  
  
I' m sure, that this concept works. So give him a try.....

Hedging and martingale strategies are never profitable in the long run.

Our expectation for hedging is not to profit more,but only to strict the loss and on V3-2 it does this.After some order, hedging is useful for this purpose.İ think if we can develop it with some other options ,it will be better. Perhaps we can do it by putting trail stop on hedge order.

İ will try to explain.  
For example hedge order trigered after 5 order later.İts lot amount will be calculated as to stop on some amount pips to reach some profit(This profit amount will be calculated as total pip profit with other orders).And also hedge order will have another stop order as recovery on some pips later.By the way if prices go on the right of hedge order,then orders will be closed on some pips later when planned total pip profit came.And also if prices turns inverse to the hedge order ,the new hedge of hedge order will be openned and will be closed on that planned total pip profit.On pip profit option there may be some loosses but when hedge order triggered some looses must be considered.  
  
Eitherly We can arrange hedge order to close when come back to the openning price also.

Hedging is pure maths and complex formula. So, excellent idea to implement BUT hard to code ( I guess) . An easy add-on to any of the shared EA here would be look for Breakeven when grid reach level = x .... I personnally began to be worried when I see **a level 7** being opened ..and _all I want at this time_ is to close the grid @ BE or even an acceptable 2 or 3 pips in the RED instead of "asking" this f** candle to go a little more down or up ...lol.  
  
I am using this Indicator ( attached) : in picture below this is the thick greenline , if trading both side you will have two lines red and green ...BE for the buys BE for the sells. Screenshot is not from my ECN broker , nor is related to XBest or Il* ,Trio* ...thus just illustrative.

I am also testing this grid on a different way ...as a night scalper on the Asian session ...on pairs where NO news release , speech, etc. might affect the ranging  
behaviour. So, on the Asian I will avoid JPY NZD and AUD crosses. GBPCHF , GBPUSD , GBPCAD, CADCHF, USDCAD,USDCHF,EURCHF, etc....are worth testing.  
Getting in half an hour after NY close and not starting new grid at maybe GMT 5:00 or 6:00 . Be sure I am not over with this. In pending coding task , I still need  
"my" buttons Start Buy , Start Sell , Close all (on this chart/magic) , another button needed ?? Start Hedge ?  
  
Usefull tool is the BBSqueeze indi ( attached) ...when Bollingers Bands widen we are for sure in a trend ...when they squeeze creating a kind of up/down "channel"  
we are in a ranging market ...a special momentum for our grid. This phenomenon mostly occurs during Asian sessions on pairs mentioned above.  
  
So , XBest Night scalper Settings are ALSO interesting to be tested ..thank you to those who would like to embrace this concept and test with me. For night scalping maybe a 1 MN TF or 5Min TF will be more adapted ( IMO) ..while at LO ...a TF of 30 minutes could be a total discovery anyone tested ? So, do not throw the towel too soon , lot of work/testing has still to be done.

Use number of cycles: True-False  
Number of Cycles to trade: 1-2-3..  
  
  
Cycle:  
EA open positions over position and after many positions taken then at some point EA manages to take all profits or BE's and starts to wait for appropriate next entries.  
  
If we call this 1 cycle for EA, is it possible to add an option for giving the number of cycles to trade? If I want it run just for 1 or 2 cycles and stop trading, then I will choose Number of cycles to trade option so EA makes the given number of cycles then stays flat without taking further positions till next manual run.  
  
The aim is minimizing the risk by reducing the time passed in the market and staying flat after making some profit in a user predifined "safe market condition"  
  
That will be very useful if we can subjectively identify a ranging area in the market for some period of time. Then we set it for running just 1 or 2 cycles depending on the predicted ranging duration. 

There are no weapons that will form against my financial prosperity.

İ think there is the best hedging option on Xbest v3-2.İt can be modified to make it better.Becouse as seen on the screen ı sent it is seen that its DD may be high when hedge order openned.So we can arrange the EA like that;When EA opens hedge order,we can arrange the hedge order's lot in order to come to for example 20 total pips.  
  
And also on Mach 3 trailig stop function not works or ı missed sth

Can someone here answer me one question - with the hedge built into a martingale type system, buying and selling, why not just net out what your total position should be and reduce/reopen rather than paying all these [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide")?   
  
Example would be if your net long 1.0 and you get a hedge trigger to short 0.5, why initiated the hedge trade when you can simply reduce your long position? This would apply more for US based accounts where hedging is not an option but even if it were, wouldn't it make more sense to just reduce instead of open and pay spreads?

Thank you for your great work rodolfolm. Is it possible you can look into my EA proposal based from the custom indicators as per attached using the same grid/hedging martingale approach?   
The general trading rule is simple as stated in the chart, however I'm not sure we can apply this into Grid Martingale & Hedging approach.  
Another point need to emphasize is that this indicator seem working better on higher timeframe to reduce volatility (noise). Please feel free to add comments/ ideas

Hi rodolfolm, can you please add an option to MACH3v1.3, like stop EA permanently when xxx of $ was reached, many times he turns winner trade to loser, we need this option to lock in profit, it's quite different than the daily target.  
Thank you man, the MACH3 IS MASTERPIECE. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

İ couldnt understand the logic of hedging on last version.Why recovery not goes on and blows up the account.İ think the best hedging way ;hedge order must be going on till the original orders will be closed on their target.There might be some loss when hedging occured but will be more safe.

And the second question: which indi should trigger the order? If you want, check "MBFX Timing, and let me pnow.  
  
Best regards, renko

Hello Renko,  
Thanks for your reply.  
Regarding hedging, since I have no knowledge about different hedging tactics, I am helpless to answer that question. You may please choose good one from your knowledge. Regarding 'trigger the order', both buy and sell orders are to be triggered when a new candle open (any time frame). No indicators are considered.  
Again, thank you very much for your support.  
Regards,  
Mavilakandy

Hi guys ,  
  
just wanted to share what I think would be usefull to change in the original (out of the box) settings MA 58 applied to close on H4 TF .  
  
This was hardly suggested by my friend Birpinar at the very beginning of this thread ...and it makes the difference . The Version I use is still XBest V2.2.

High DD yes , it has always be with grid/marti . For me max DD is 50% ...with max profit . There is a lot of settings that only have 15 to 25 % dd , but they produce poorly. If ever going live with this EA , Equity protection would be set to 50% ..and after 30/35% dd sometimes after level 6 or 7 I would look to manual intervention using all I know about manual trading to close at BE. Or another technique that I will explain further. That if implemented in this EA would be the first Grid ea to do this.  
  
Cescof did you came along with settings for a 9 to 12 months period that are satisfactory ?  
  
No optimization ?  
  
Anyone tried this EA on RENKO charts ??

Hi rayeesdar , yes your are then using Trio Orchestra ( trio dancer , ilan , same stuff different name ) . To stop this , you need to change ea to Xbest V2.2 or later versions that you will found here in the thread.

Hi Stephen, Thanks for mentioning the moving average idea. In fact the idea was to trade when market is above 100+ pips from the given moving averages but since you are trying something new, I wanted to give the exact settings for the levels I mentioned.  
  
  
1H: 58 period smoothed and HLC/3  
4H: 36 period smoothed HLC/3  
  
These levels have high importance in market.  
  
The Picture below shows an envelope band with these settings on 1H and with a deviation of 0.7%. Center line is the moving average with settings I have given.  
I believe this can help to understand the idea. If you start the EA above or below 100+ pips from the center line (close to upper or lower band) we will have a high chance for closing all trades without getting caught to a trend for a long period of time. Because it'll test the center line again. even if it goes to the center line, it'll go up again or range in the center line and if it goes higher, then it'll come back to where it started again which will give the EA enough chance to make good profit without getting caught to a trend for a long period of time. but of course that can be done only for a limited time since it still can go lower low or higher high if we get caught to a trend.  
  
The idea was to catch a fish for the dinner with less risk and stop trading.  
  
Regards.

Thank you my friend for passing by here and leave us so wonderfull tips. At this moment unfortunately there is still no interface (GUI) that allow us to to Start Buy, Start Sell , Close all , to trade a manual strategy like the one you described above. My family is big...so , I will look for several fish or a big one.

Thanks rodolfolm! however I tested the new hedge function but it seems not working.  
Can you please add the same to xBest_RV3.4 in order to compare the performance with and without the hedge.  
Thanks in advance!

Hi stefdek,  
  
thank you for your continuous efforts to improve the EA. In your above test you are using a grid increment factor of 10...right? That means you are trading 10 lots already on grid level 4 and even 100 lots on level 5? Please correct me if wrong. Moreover the term "**GridIncrementFactor"** is unclearly if not wrong because it is really a LotIncrementFactor!  
I dont understand the 58MA concept of entries in your test because it makes only sense for me if starting the EA 100+ pips away from this MA according to birpinar's findings.  
  
I continue to focusing on multipairs basket trading on M15 and RV3.4 (max. lot limit!) which gave me about 1000€ this week in forward test with low DD and I do consider to go live by middle of next month. I got the best results when TP is set about half of grid step size.  
  
Happy weekend, jdva 

I never lose - either I win or I learn...

With so many ea in this tread, I have lost track in which one everyone is using? I was also wondering if it can go back to original settings i know that the tread is trying a way to fight the drawdown?

Moreover the term "GridIncrementFactor" is unclearly if not wrong because it is really a LotIncrementFactor!

Hi jdva , thank you for your input here. To answer your questions - yes 0,01 : 0.10 : 1.00 : 10.0 : 100.0 I agree this is absurd ...I would never trade like this.It is like  
holding a snake by the tail..."he" will bite you in anytime. Now about the 58 MA concept , again , I agree that by time of testing I did not catched the whole picture that Birpinar explained later , damn interesting ; although I do not know how to set this concept in the EA variables. ( any clue?) .  
So, EA would have to be started manually , do its job and get out quickly , done for the day. Multipair trading with conservative settings is a good way to go. Although I would pick pairs where I am not too exposed on a single currency ...something like GBPCHF EURUSD CADJPY AUDNZD in which you have all currencies BUT never 2 pairs exposed to a single currency like EUR _GBP GBP_ JPY ....etc. _"TP is set about half of grid step size"_ excellent TIP here ..thank you for this .  
  
Keep on bringing ideas here to share.

Hi luaciego , yes , many EA´s many versions trying to fit personal views on how to trade a grid/marti.Most of them have not even been tested , or if have been tested , results are not shared here. A lot of download´s with no reports ...normal FF stuff , maybe ea´s here are deceptives or do not produce what is the downloader looking for... . So, YES , we are trying to find among all theses EA , the best one with the best settings for a relatively steady grow with no blowup. You are welcome here to share your insight , ideas , test results ...Just like Cescof , Jdva and others did few posts above...

Thanks stefdek for the setting.  
However, tested with your setting file, it is quite different to your result.  
Not sure what was wrong.

Note: Spread makes a lot of difference in result. I put the spread filter for this!!  
  
Leverage also does!  
  
Brokerage rules too. (Min pips StopLoss Min Pips Take Profit etc)

thanks rodolfolm for your constant efforts to "tame the monster"...indeed a very difficult undertanking...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)! Actually, your profit factors are very well but unfortunately the DDs are too high. Please try to get a max. drawdown below 30% because I think nobody is able to trade higher DDs than those in real account.  
  
Happy trading. jdva

thanks stefdek for your suggestion to trade those 4 pairs in a basket...! I is very worthy to do a test with them. But..as we all know sometimes just **one** pair is enough to blow an account. Basically, I guess and also hope that more pairs (about 10) should be able to do mutually balance out, of course a very well funded account is needed.  
  
Stay tuned...

so I realized the high DD in the latest version is due to trade from Friday to Monday.

Hi pnithi , yes I know , backtest differs a lot according to broker history data. Can you try to get more trustable dataon your side , modeling quality on your backtest  
is only 55% ...thus for a grid looking to take 3 pips ( or 7 pips) data accuracy is very important. I think that Birt´s data suite is the most trustable ( ggogle it) , I am  
using free ticks data from Tickstory , this little software download the ticks for me while I am doing other things , and install/convert them in the right directory.  
Please test also the 2 settings I pinpoint below. If it blows , try with 7,500$ starting balance ..then with 10,000K ...you will find settings that might need 50,000 $ cents  
but with a low DD of 20% ...who knows ? On my side I am testing EURGBP only with settings I published here ...these settings will blow my account when backtesting  
them on Brexit votation time , can we expect another Brexit or a BREXIN ( UK back to EU) ...well Brexit votation have been announced several months before. So it  
was non-sense to trade the GBP at this time...just stay out till market consolidate...and activate the ea thereafter.

Hi friend , yes , I think also it could be good if testing 8 or 10 pairs altogether ...as an example you can play with the ea settings ONLY BUY or ONLY SELL , so if your  
basket includes GBPUSD & GBPJPY ...you can buy the GU and sell GY ...if Pound is getting very strong ...you will bank $$$ at each 3 or 10 pips tp level ...while the other pair will start to build its grid..this is just an idea.

sorry mate, I dont understand..your backtest started on a Tuesday (2017.02.07) and went on for about one year till Friday, 2018.02.23! Can you please explain what you are meaning or want to tell us?

Yep, good idea..my friend.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)..provided that the EA goes along with that setting...perhaps rodolfolm may confirm...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60b.png?v=15.1)

Thank you for your great effort to take this monster. I can imagine the number of hours you spent on working this EA. I see you added some more features and indicators to the latest version. I am BT your latest version, the default settings I think are not suitable for scalping.   
  
(1) The target price is 1800 on default setting, which is 180 PIPs, 180 pips target take days to get there, huge draw down is expected, the timeframe should be DAY for price target 180 pips. Maybe you mean 18 or 180 pips?   
  
(2) Many errors when it tried to modify orders.

Many EAs failed USDJPY and EURJPY in last 10 days because of their one way big move, many accounts blow out as well. I've tested the latest EA with some change in the settings, mainly changed the target from 1800 to default 30, disabled trailing stop. It did survive with 5 minutes time frame.

Hi all, I got some interesting result from backtesting xBest v2.2 on 1k account, Pair: GBPJPY, TF: M5, Period: from 1/1/2017 to 2/23/18.  
Those nasty spikes you will see in the graph, it's the hedge's interventions, saved my assh many times. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f605.png?v=15.1)  
Do you think we will get a margin call on one of these spikes.

Hi all, thanks stefdek and laharjaya, sure thing, I will keep backtesting and backtesting and backtesting and backtesting and backtesting...   
Regarding my last post, I want to discuss something about the hedge function.  
There's a little flow in the hedge function, sometimes the price hit the HFTP* quickly with sudden move, and other times it doesn't because the HFTP is too wide, so the price keep ranging in the area below the HFTP in case of uptrend, which for sure it will test anybody patience if that happens to him in live account, because the range movement take month or so... the good thing is that your account won't blow up.  
The solution is to narrow somehow that wide distance between the HFTP and the last position, and that will be rodolfolm's job.  
Regards,  
  
*Hedge Function Target Profit.

Guys, i really appreciate your effort and enthusiasm on developing a attractive and secure grid - but it will not happen. I am not hating, just sharing my view based on my experience. You are not reinventing the wheel here, many others already tried to "develop" a grid safe enough to use by using hedging, different martingale approaches and filters. I even own many of them. The math is pretty simple, every time you are entering a trade market can move to the wrong side.   
  
In the end you will be running in cycles. Sooner or later DD will occur, that is larger than the accumulated gain. You can be lucky and grow your account for some time before it happens. Selecting "special" pairs or timeframes is not the key, as filtering means reducing risk AND gains simultanesly. Trending moves will occur on every pair sooner or later.  
  
Do not take me wrong - it is fine to use grids as long as you are aware of the risk, which you will not get rid of no matter what you are trying here. The recent versions are already optimized to the max, every change will simply transfer the risk to other market situations.

1) Running a grid EA full time will result in the dd you mention some day; but still many of us think, that we can manage to start it in sideway markets, and stop it before trending markets begin/ avoid trending markets.  
2) There is a grid EA on mql5 markets, whose developer has made a backtest to 2003... and each year he had gain.  
<https://www.mql5.com/en/market/product/20937>  
Lots of satisfied achievements, and he does not even has to stop his EA for a/some while... (btw it has a news filter)  
Until now it is running, it also has live results <https://www.mql5.com/en/users/daveng/seller>  
Why can't we make it to this ?! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
But sure, you are right. Just a worse case scenario, you think it'll come back, and it never comes back...  
I think if you have so many grid EAs, your contribution is at a high worth ;

Btw: The EA I mentioned does not hedge.  
Developer has some sort of filter, which lets the EA only start, when conditions have been met.  
This is what he says: "Just a reminder that Grid Hero doesn't necesarily trade every day, hence you will need some patience while waiting for trades. Grid Hero will only enter the market when there is a reason to." - Maybe this is the reason, maybe he has an indicator which accurately detects whether there is a range coming up or not. [He calls it 'Built-in pips averaging mathematical algrorithm (P.A.M.A.)' - so pip in/decrease must give signals.] Thought it might be helpful.  
_Edit:_ Don't want to pollute, but somehow I found out what the key elements of the EA are  
-only post this because I think it could give some new interesting ideas in our development.  
  
Below is a summary of the EAs market entry criteria - its reasons to trade. Otherwise it will stay out of market.  
  
Market Trending Entry:  
\-----------------------------  
\- Multiple time frames trending confluences  
\- No overbought or oversold conditions  
\- Optimized time filtering  
\- Low volatility condition  
  
Price Action Entry:  
\------------------------  
\- The Hammer,- The Shooting Star,- Dragon Fly Doji,- Gravestone Doji,- Bullish Engulfing,- Bearish Engulfing,- Bullish Full Engulfing,- Bearish Full Engulfing,- White Marubozu,- Black Marubozu,- Standard Bullish Doji,- Standard Bearish Doji,- Long Legged Bullish Doji,- Long Legged Bearish Doji,- The Morning Star  
\- The Evening Star,- Bullish Gap Up,- Bearish Gap Down,- The Rising Sun,- The Dark Cloud Cover,- Bullish Spinning Top,- Bearish Spinning Top  
  
Artificial Instinct Entry:  
\------------------------------  
\- Keltner signal  
\- DMI signal  
\- RSI signal  
\- CCI signal  
\- Stochastic signal  
\- Parabolic Sar signal  
\- Bollinger signal  
\- Envelopes signal

By "declaring" sideway markets you are predicting the market, and I really encourage you to avoid this by all means. Noone is able to do so. There are dozens of events in the past, where extraordinary movements occured during asia session for example (just have a look at the black monday in 2015 to pick one). Furthermore backtests are useless in terms of checking reliability, the same way as demotrading is by the way.  
  
I may repeat, it is possible to succeed using grids (look at one of my live accounts as proof for example), but it is very unlikely with the "typical" grids that are utilizing general market movements the way Trio Orchestra does. I even shared some of the famous ones with several thread contributors who contacted me via pm. But as these EA's will only waste your time sharing them in public does not make any sense. Ignore everything that distracts you on your road to success. Just google for the famous ones like Ilan trio, Autoprofit or Grider if you like.   
  
As grid trading requires large accounts many use them as their main trading approach, which is extremely risky. Grids could be part of a portfolio, but should never be the main trading concept. Do not focus on them too much.

perhaps it is a stupid idea, but I think that if we integrate EA ( Voldemar ) into the existing pipbeast EA we get a great and excelent EA   
as you can see, he tries to close the trade which is the furthest away.  
IMHO you can reduce the risk a lot when you tade like that  
  
Let me know if you think this can work

Thanks Erwin , there is very little info on valdemar227 behaviour , and what exactly it does . I have seen it also on another "hot" thread Lost sock Evolution here @FF.  
  
Now , the concept to kill the early trades ( the one´s that has 0,01 or even 0,03 trades with high PIPS DD) using the latest position ( let say 0,48) when in profit is GREAT , this can be done manually..( I am doing this sometimes) .... . Difficult to explain without a drawing , but if your latest bigger position is ranging 15 pips up ...15 pips down without any direction ...you can close it when 0,01 is -4$ ; 0,03 -8$ ...and 0,48 position is +12$ ...so you "kill" the biggest DD pips trades with the few pips made by the biggest position. This will NOT affect the Breakeven line. Two scenario price continues in YOUR way and grid is closed , or price then continue AGAINST your grid , position 0,48 is re-opened ...BUT very far "little 0,01" positions have been closed .   
  
Coding instructions would be something like this :  
  
\- When level reach x position , try to "kill" first y trades ( first two or first 3 ...) .  
  
I am not a coder nor have an idea to implement this ....  
  
Always think outside the box ...suggestions welcome.

[quote=stefdek;10816234]{quote} Thanks Erwin , there is very little info on valdemar227 behaviour ,   
  
Maybe you can watch this thread, in this thread Voldemar designed more ea like this one and theres also the logic explains behind this ea  
<https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=583322>  
  
I`m also not a coder :-(   
But i was thinking something like this L  
\- when the latest trades are in profit more then let we say € 5,00 exucute the trades in profit and the one who is the farrest away.   
Then ( i think he has te recalculate the take profit factor in pips.   
  
Hope you`ll understand ?

ok...this is the concept , although in this picture taken from the other thread mentioned above where it is a GRID ..with fixed 0,01 lot ( no marti) . In Xbest R  
this is a marti , so higher position will "weight" much more than the "far away" position :

Can you try to get more trustable dataon your side , modeling quality on your backtest is only 55% ...thus for a grid looking to take 3 pips ( or 7 pips) data accuracy is very important. I think that Birt´s data suite is the most trustable ( ggogle it) , I am using free ticks data from Tickstory , this little software download the ticks for me while I am doing other things , and install/convert them in the right directory.

Thanks stefdek for good advice always. Will test those 2 settings and share the result. But maybe 2 weeks later after I clear up my thing here first.  
For the backtest, I downloaded the data from MT4/history center and no idea if I could get the data from other places. I will google what you suggest.   
I tried not to trade EUR and GBP since it blew my account many times. Yes, stay out till market consolidate as you said.

Hi all, some back-testing with xBest v2.2 on 1k account, Pair: USDJPY, TF: M5, Period: from 4/3/2017 to 2/23/2018 (I wanted to test a whole year, but this is the farthest historical data provided in 5-minutes).

To answer your questions - yes 0,01 : 0.10 : 1.00 : 10.0 : 100.0 I agree this is absurd ...I would never trade like this.It is like holding a snake by the tail..."he" will bite you in anytime. Now about the 58 MA concept , again , I agree that by time of testing I did not catched the whole picture that Birpinar explained later , damn interesting ; although I do not know how to set this concept in the EA variables. ( any clue?) . So, EA would have to be started manually , do its job and get out quickly...

Stefdek, there is a thread on FF discussing **MovingAveragesDistance** with an indicator:  
  
<https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=545718>  
  
Perhaps a coder can incorporate this function into the EA...unfortunately a price, not pips distance but maybe usefull nevertheless... 

I never lose - either I win or I learn...

Much much better,  
GBPJPY: same TF, same period, same settings, different EA, better results.  
I'll be playing with the settings some more.

Thank you Sol4live for sharing... what does your/ rodolfo exactly do ? So, we all know and maybe we can share testing here ..if you want.

For the SOL4LIVE EA to work, you must open NonLagMA 7.1 on your chart  
  
the EA open trades in the direction of the trend. it continue to open one trade per candle for as long as the colour remains the same.  
  
Here is NonLagMA in case you don't have one

Could you remove the following:  
1\. global Takeprofit  
2\. stoploss  
3\. when opposite trade is opened, previous trades should not close  
  
thank you for your effort

Hi jdva, I'm still doing backtests with the new EA.  
Here is the reports of the two results, you will see the net profit of the new EA is much better.

Hi Falanca , we have capable coders yes ..we have seen hem here trying to help , doing their best. Problem is ; if no one report a bug or problem using their EA , how can they have a clue on what is not working ? . If you refer to have a highly skilled top of the top coder ( which much also be a trader ) , think about preparing _at least_ a couple of hundreds $$$. Think also, that if we were "capable" traders we might not need an EA to trade this market.So , don´t be too tough with "our" guys here , they are doing a good job , and need feedback till they finally produce the gem.

Thanks Rodolfolm, Great work   
But what i really meant was the following:  
the latest trades should kill the trade who is the farrest away   
  
so lets say we have 6 open trades :  
1: Buy 0.01 loss -€5,00  
2: Buy 0.02 Loss -€3,50  
4: Buy 0.03 Loss -€ 0,50  
5: Buy 0..4 win €2,50  
6: Buy 0.05 Win €5,00   
  
Minimall profit to close lets say € 2,50   
then should trade 1, 5 and 6 closed and so on and on.   
  
Hope you`ll understand what i meant ?  
  
But great work and keap up with it please   
  
Erwin

1-Does trailing stop function works on EAs  
2-Only on Xbeast 2-2,hedging function works properly.  
3-The logic of pipbeast and other EA s seems very different.Why not coders use same logic.  
4-Stop loss function for hedge orders works on some versions tough there is no such opton on the table  
  
So ı think coders plays on the same EA , becouse its noneless to code so much versions.  
İ dont want to be tough but we are trying all of them hopelessly

Hi Falanca ,  
  
well , to be sincere I have never tested nor trailing or Hedge functions (yet) . So, more testing needed here. The only point of four you mention that I can attempt to answer is the "logic" of Pipbeast/trio dancer/ilan . Well , I never understood completely the logic behind the 3 "animals" inside pipbeast/trio ...3 sells or buy , or 2 sell , 1 buy , entry logic. Opening 3 starting positions with even thinny lots 0,01 might seriously drive you toward huge DD then needing a higher starting balance. i could NEVER find long haul ( 2 years at least) Live trading positive results with these EA. If hedge is implemented in Yamil/Rodolfo EA , how could this be present in a "trio" of grids ( seems very complicated to me ) . The only thing that I found VERY interesting in the Trio was the ONE TRADE PER CANDLE stuff , totally different of any grid out-there ( they use fixed grid spacing). I personnally feel more comfortable with 0,01 starting lot , one trade per candle , and it is working for me. During Asian session I am using 5 Min tf , when asian session is about to finish , I switch to TF15 min , and go to sleep. No news filter. Grid spacing 6 , tp 4 , multiplier 2.2 , one trade per candle at this moment MA 58 smoothed applied to close.

Hi Zack , yes , indeed , this one seems really a Holygrail. I must say wooaw.This fxpipone is a real beast. Only few problems. Is not for sale. 5,000$ minimum investment , ea creator takes 1/3 of your profit.While does not say anything about high watermark. If you have a loosing month ( or 2) , there is NO "refund" , so you risk your full account balance to spoon mouth feeding the guy...each month. & You are alone if total balance is gone.Not fair deal for a black box thing and an absurd minimum 5k account opening. On the website , there is too few live account still traded , most have stopped updating @ myfxbook ( reason ?) . Or Yamil or Rodolfo could make maybe a reverse engineering just looking how it does trade...tuff work.  
  
I have downloaded the EXPIRED version of this EA ....available on website.  
  
Zack , you should create a youtube channel...lol.

I would never aquire anything when it is not a verified account at myfxbook.com (or mql5.com). It just makes no sense for the publisher himself, to not open and show the results.  
But right now am far away form aquiring anything on marketplace.  
  
Guys,  
since we are posting youtube videos, I need to share this with you... 2 very interesting approaches for turning loosing trades into win trades  
(from min 3:00 gets interesting)  

Inserted Video

Hi Falanca, I have to clarify something, you said the trailing stop is not working, here what you have to do; put the EA on the strategy tester and select your favorite pair, chart template, time-frame... slow the tester to 29, play your favorite playlist songs, chill-out and enjoy the beautiful sight of the EA dealing with the market, from time to time steal a glance at P/L info, it is always in negative numbers because the EA closes the winning trades and keeping the losing ones till they turn positive, sometimes the P/L appears in positive numbers but the EA is not closing them, instead he letting them run till the trend ends and the price retraces. If that happens you know the trailing stop works, and believe me I've seen it many times.  
The hedging function is not perfect, still need a lot of works but hey... look how much progress we made so far.  
Our objectives here is to analyze and find the weaknesses of the EA and to try to make him smarter so he can survive the market without the need of a big fat account. We are fortunate that we find coders who are willing to the job without commission.  
Peace.

Hello ZackAZAAL,  
Different brokers are giving totally different results when EAs are back tested. I have tested with same parameters of your back test. But I got different result from from different brokers. See attached screenshots. I have seen several of similar examples. So, my question is, how far we can rely these back tests ?

If you're not achieving a modelling quality of at least 90% then you're simply wasting your time as the back test is pretty much invalid.  
  
You need better quality data to test on. In fact, anything less than 99% quality is not indicative of the performance of an EA - it is entirely possible to show an EA having huge success using just 90% quality, but then have that same EA fail miserably when presented with 99% quality data.  
  
If you're really invested in trying to make this (or any) EA work, then you should get a copy of Tick Data Suite and use the data provided by it. Anything less is not trustworthy.  
  
All that said, you're right: different brokers can produce wildly differing results. EAs have to be optimised for each broker you run them on - in most cases, you cannot simply take the .set files provided by someone else and expect to get the same results.

Hi Mavil , _your backtests_ are totally irrelevant with ANY broker if you have 36% or even 65% modeling quality. Waste of time. Furthermore spread.Your backtest are  
made with a spread (current) of ZERO ...or even 5 points which is 0,5 pips ..also irrelevant. Before backtesting download history ticks for the period you want to test.  
This is not going to your metatrader history center . going to USDJPY , click 5 min chart and download ...then test . WRONG.  
  
Search google for Tickstory ... or learn to convert Dukascopy tick data to your Mt4 ... then redo your tests ... then critics are welcome.

Hello Stefdek and PaulDV,  
Thanks for your comments. I have done several back tests, none of them was matching with the one reported here. So, I just kept quite.  
Further, without knowing all those points, I have traded in live account and already bankrupted.  
I need your support to get valid tick data as I am not an expert in these things. Appreciate very much if you please provide me a link of such data.

Hi,  
  
Have tested on GBPJPY, knowing that this is one of the most volatile pair as per attached result and then I realised you guys mentioning about the modelling quality which I only have 90%. Can you advise how should I get the 99.9% quality before i proceed backtest?

Hi Rodolfolm,  
  
Would you consider replacing NonLagMA with this custom non-repaint indicator using the same approach to sol4live EA?  
  
Also please see attached video that gives some idea on new hedging martingale strategy (consist of 3 part videos). Can this actually works or do any of your custom EA already using such concept?

Hi mavilakandy, The purpose of my backtests is to show that the EA can -with the right settings- survive with 1k account, even though it's not recommended to trade with such margin and the EA is still under development.  
Bear in mind, the market changes, correlations changes and every pair has its own characteristics, what worked in the past might not work in the future, that's what the market teached us and still teaching us many things every time.  
I'm so sorry I should have motioned this before.

Hi all, after many backtests I notice that trailing stop is disabling the work of the hedge function, I made an amateur video ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f631.png?v=15.1) tried to explain that.  
(JEEZ, my editing skills sucks)

I have been running the new version of xbest 3.4 with a 3k account for the past 2 days since the update came out and I changed the staring pip to .03 lots made it a little bit more aggressive.I traded with four different pairs eurd usd, gpbjpy, eurjpy,and usd jpy .I did notice a couple things like it would close trades without using the take profit I feel like that messed it up and then close it early it would be a .91 lot for 11.50 dollars, in my opinion, I don't think it is worth closing it like that when you leverage that high to which is own. In 2 days that it ran it was able to make 1000 dollars in profit. Second is there any way to change the setting so we can have it like one of the first ones like pipbeaast or trio dancer i know they were risky and they will blow your account but if you want to make money take it out and let it blow your account and repeat I think they were awesome again everyone has there personal choice. Great job to the coders I think you guys are making it into a great EA there is hardly any drawdown and the drawdown that happen is because I made it trade more aggressively. Again this all depends on your trading style if you want to make quick money and leave and come back or you want to play it safe. I for one would like to make at least 1500 a week out of a 3000 account and from there just withdraw and make money.I know greed.Thank you again for all the hard work.

Hi luaciego,  
  
May I ask what is your settings on xbest 3.4 to get such result? Did you set for Daily Target since you mentioned about you want to get quick money and leave before coming back again?

Hello,  
this is my first post on this thread. I am using Xbest V2.2 on pair EURJPY TF M5, on real account, initial deposit is $147 on 21 Februari and now growth as you see on my attached file.  
I had withdrawn $100. No filter news, filter one order by candle is false and all setting is default.  
  
thank you all   
  
so here is my result

Guys,  
I think we have lost a little the overview over all appraoches and ideas...  
There is that hedging function bgntrs mentioned, then we had the idea of birpinar with the pip distance to moving averages (58) and the suggestion of petewong to incooperate a custom indicator into another EA... I think I have also read something about renko bars.  
Does someone know what else is missing... / I think we should always concentrate on the two main EAs we have in this thread and improve them/ or select 1  
  
We should sum it up clear so that none of the coders has to read through last 5-10 pages...  
Btw: Is any of the coders still here?! 

Check page 1 for all infos...

ZackAZAAL, I do fully agree with you. With some luck it is very easy even with default settings to make some money in short term on these EAs, but I think we want to be successfull in the long run...right?  
For instance, I got 4k in two weeks demo, but lost them all this night just on one pair AUDNZD (even not considered as a volatile one) on its drop without sufficient retracement... using a lot multiplier of 2 on M15 TF/ no hedge. I was testing 12 pairs, the other 11 pairs made 0,3k profit on that day but what possible use is that!?  
Actually, I'm not a friend of hedging but in the meanwhile I believe that without it those sort of EAs are not going to be profitable in the middle/long run if at all. Also regular money withdrawing should not really help because of the time problem.  
I know Rodolfo has already created a hedge function but to be honest I don't know how it works and how to setup and I don't remember anybody is using it successful.  
BTW, the **Hedging Plan of bgntrs** looks very interesting to me and deserves further testing if coded...many thanks already in advance to the coder...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60b.png?v=15.1)!  
  
Happy trading, jdva

[quote=AndrewBa-;10833744]Guys, I think we have lost a little the overview over all appraoches and ideas...   
  
I Hope that Rodolfolm create the EA i mentioned in post 586.   
So that de latetst trades kill the trade who is the farrest away.  
  
By the way i don`t think you can found a settings what would survive all times.  
I think you should increase your pips by news ore maybe better to shut it down and come back later again.   
When you let the ea run and you don`t do nothing at all you`ll will be blown out ( I think )

I just saw this indicator on mql5. Would be cool if we could integrate it. But then we would have to buy it.

Thanks for sharing the idea. I'm looking for the hedging for martingale for very long times and very interested in your idea.   
But after reading your idea many times, I still cannot imagine what would be the result at the end of hedging. My stupid....  
So, please let me ask the question. With this kind of hedging, if it's very strong downtrend (say another 200-300 pips) away from last position before hedging starts and we need to continue opening BUY trade with bigger lot size until not enough money to open trade anymore, then what we can do is waiting for the reversal or account wipe out from margin call, right?

Hi stefdek,  
  
thanks for updating Page 1...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)!  
  
I especially like your proposal to switch to higher timeframes, f. i. M15>M30,H1 when in big DD given one trade per candle is activated (true in settings). Do you have tested this whether the EAv3.4 or v2.2 does recognize and manage that timeframe switching accordingly and does open a new trade only on a new candle? Or is it just an idea from you?  
  
Thx, jdva

I think that just means that when everyone of us pays a small amout of $ rodolfolm will have it easier to concentrate on the EA, without hiding the mql4 (and therefore won't sell it)

probably not...but he possibly wants to gain recognition for his efforts which is actually a natural course of action. Thus you may follow my example and donate a small amount too...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60f.png?v=15.1)!

This was my losing AN trade from this night (other PC), very likely a hedging mode or just timeframe switching would have helped to survive (Max. lot was 5 thus no margin issue):

If you're using conservative lot exponent, you can survive EVEN without hedging. For example 1.1 lot exponent, you can survive most moves, even 300 pips. So long you start with balance of about 5k  
  
The hedge system is to reduce the DD to allow us to sleep more comfortable. The system is there to make the distance to recovery easier.

ea is free to always and opensource. I'm just leaving a link to donations. for those who want to donate. I spend a lot of time coding as ideas that are many. I do not have much time to encode  
I am here to help. could very well develop an EA just for me and quit selling but I do not want it. I want to share my creations and help all .

M15>M30,H1 when in big DD given one trade per candle is activated (true in settings). Do you have tested this whether the EAv3.4 or v2.2 does recognize and manage that timeframe switching accordingly and does open a new trade only on a new candle? Or is it just an idea from you?

Hi pal , I am trading demo ONE pair only EURGBP...so I focus only on this one at this time .. My approach is dynamic and can ( at this time ) only be traded manually.  
While in London and overlapping NY sessions the EA is on TF15 min ...if things complicate ..somewhere at 4 or 5 levels ...I switch to TF30.... if any cycle is closed near  
NY close hour ..then I switch to TF5minutes for the night ( Asian Session) till one hour before Frankfurt open where I switch back o TF15.  
  
So, during Asian Session the EA acts like a night scalper ..I even switch settings Grid size 3 TP 3 and same 1.5 factor ....maximizing profits during Asian ....  
  
All this manually tweaking ...definitely NOT a set and forget stuff ...greedy fools will go with a G3/TP3 5 min right into LO ...  
  
At this moment we are still n NY sessions for a while , thus my TF is 15 min and grid is 6 to 3 ...MA selected will only admit BUY trades and we are in an uptrend.

Also , I am now looking to close ALL trade at BE before NY close ...so , I have no open trade for the weekend. Monday starting hour will be GMT : 8:00 all set at TF15  
and G6/TP3 ....

An ex4 is a black box and nobody likes it. I will share the mql4.  
At the moment I am working on the idea of dutchmen "kill oldest loosing positions with newest winning positions".  
But I'm also working on a version with pending orders. I'll post here when mature.

> 
> Ignored

The settings im using to get these results is .3 lots and open trade candle by order false. Grid increment of 1.3. I do feel like 1.5 will get you in trouble.I'm thinking if I ever decide to run this live with 3,000 accounts on Fridays make me minimum money so i can withdraw all the profits. Currently, i change currencies pairs based on what big news that is going on. I like stefdek idea of changing the settings to make it make more money during the asian market.I noticed that the asain market is where it makes its least amount of money.Could also be the pairs i have running .Im going to be running this set up for another month or 2 and see how it does if im avering more than 2000 a week on profit i am more than willing to give it a try. Again i dont let this trade all my it self i do mmonitor this daily and see what it is doing. Great work to the coders i have noticed no huge drawdown like the original versions. The most lowest drawdown with a 3000k accout and running three pairs with .3 lots has been 300 or 400 dollars which in my opinion is awesome. Im going to try to post how it did this week.

This is a NEWS filter. If there is big financial news coming ..the EA will not take any trade for the CURRENCY concerned.  
There will be NO trades for theses currencies monday ( specific hour) if filter is activated . Do you have an idea how news can impact on the behaviour of a currency ?  
FFcall is a NEWS indicator.

Live account? Why not demo for a couple of months to see what to expect. Did you backtest this EA?

Which version?  
  
Remembering all versions are still in development. None yet completed. so do not add to real account without first analyzing the demo and backtest tests  
  
Once completed I will add the full description of the parameters and user manual.

What a great result of your Fx2 , nice settings , especially the 20 pips distance and exponent 1,2 are quite safe settings ...theses 3 pairs have a daily range between 60  
and 90 pips.So, ONE of theses pairs can still start trending for 2 or 3 days and still being alive . If I were your , since you have more than doubled your account I would  
stop trading one of the EURO pairs , not to expose yourself to EURxxx too much.  
  
Keep one Fx2 , nice share.

With 175% monthly gain and a 21% DD .....I would just setup an equity protection to 75%, I mean when DD is 25% of balance ..just close all. Have lunch and rince and repeat ...all loss should be back within a week or less.  
  
If I was Fx2 I would not withdraw 1k ...just the initial investment... so , I have some more balance to withstand any coming DD... With such results , temptation is big to increase starting lot size ...and this is where most grid fails ... GREED.

Thanks. Yes it's safe settings you can see USDJPY was trending about 500 pips down and it didn't blowup the account  
I think EURGBP and EURCHF not correlated? cause sometimes I see 1 going up and the other going down

Robot could well use trend awareness, i.e. the _slope_ of i.e. ema(20). As it often buys highs, sells lows..  
->1.identify trend (-> slope of ma)  
->2.if trend contrary to previous trend -> trend changed -> trade according to trend (->keep hedging counter positions?)

Hi Rodolfom,  
  
Back-testing your new verion Xbest with FxCore, I like it so far. However, I have a question, where to change the lot size on FxCore? It starts with 0.50 lot, that's huge lot to start, can I change it to 0.1, 0.2, or 0.3?   
  
Thank you very much for your efforts! If I make $ with your EA in real account, I will definitely donate $ to you.

ok. Higher timeframe will incurs in less grid levels when entering DD ..( building up your grid).  
  
This is already explained at the beginning of this thread. But fine.  
  
Imagine you are trading USDJPY whether asian or NY session . your are buying, your grid spacing is 10 pips....Ea set on 5 min TF and ONE TRADE per candle ...so, EACH 5 minutes , EA look at the price , if latest position is 8 pips away ea will not open new position..it will wait till next 5min candle and look again.5 min later 10 pips distance has been broken and ea open another position. Now, let say "rocketman" just launch a missile that hits Hawai and USDJPY starts plummeting 200 pips within an hour ( one hour candle) ...  
  
If your settings are on 5 min TF ...there will be 12 (twelve) positions opened against you , if your EA is set on ONE TRADE ONLY PER 15min Candle you will have only 4 levels buy positions opened against you.  
  
Luaciego, I tried to describe with words what is CRISTAL CLEAR when you look at the EA while trading , you can do a Backtest in Visual Mode to "see" it by yourself or  
on a DEMO account set 2 pips distance TP1 on a 1 minute time frame ...when you have 2 levels opened switch to 5 min TF , 15 tf , 30 min TF ..difference are so obvious.

Re: FxCore v1 - Developer Beta ...  
  
it sounds a great idea. both trio dancer and corefx are pretty nice profitable eas while own short comings though. the fxcore v1 can be a correct way to overcome the shorts if any. i'll try to run it and see any result.  
  
actually, the idea on post 591 should be more focused on, it's really sth new.

I am using ICmarket for backtesting, see screenshots on my test for USDJPY for this Friday. I lost a lot of real money this Friday on USDJPY's big drop because EAs I used kept buying starting from 106.75 (to 105.5 until blow out the account at 5:00 AM with 15 lots buy), trying to find some way to beat the loss.  
  
On this test below, I choose SHORT ONLY and the return is very good, just wondering if running two separate instances - one short and one long would help the return and reduce big DD.  
  
Would be good if the EA can limit the max # of lots can buy like BEAST EA.

Hi luaciego,  
  
In your EA settings, there is this option for "Daily Target in Money"profit. Did you set any target for that option (eg. USD100, USD200, etc)?  
The reason i ask is because I suspect this option may not be functioning.

Hi Andrew,  
  
I been downloading the historical data from History Center as per your advise.  
However when downloaded the data it shows at the top left side “Database 65000 / 120188 records” and upon running the strategy tester, my modelling quality is always at 90% only as opposed to others who can get 99.9%? Would you kindly advise what did I miss anything?

Thanks for EA version.  
I did the backtest for XBest with FxCore with default setting, Looked at the result tab in testing strategy, seems it open 2 series of lot size (e.g., 2 sell trade, one is 0.45 and the other 0.01 at the same time). Could you kindly explain what the purpose of of combining those 2 version? Have attached screen and put arrow to those 2 sell for reference.

No, you didn't miss anything. Anyone of use has 90% of modeling quality. For 99% you need to buy a subscription, for example from tick data suite. They can provide you with 99% tick quality. (However, I think 2 weeks test period are for free.)

I lost a lot of real money this Friday on USDJPY's big drop because EAs I used kept buying starting from 106.75 (to 105.5 until blow out the account at 5:00 AM with 15 lots buy), trying to find some way to beat the loss.

Guys, I am just saying that this EA is still a blowup EA. We still havent found a way to reduce the DD risk. I wish it wasnt a blowup EA!  
  
I mean what if you are in DD and a week later when news comes you are still in DD of 30%? Bumm! Margin call![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f525.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f412.png?v=15.1)!

Hi bmcgowra,  
in an earlier post you mentioned the pipfinite trend pro indicator, and that it would be an advantage if we could incooperate it into our EAs.  
Which way you think it would be an advantage, can you explain it?! Since the indicator is only showing the direction of movement... so our grid EAs would only open positions into the trading direction. But isn't that opposite to the idea of grid EAs?! Once the movement changes, we haven't opened any positions in that (new) direction yet, and cannot cover any losses that were made before...  
  
Since I was building an EA for this indi, I thought about it. 

Check page 1 for all infos...

Of course, a hedging feature should reduce DDs but performance too...I guess everybody knows and would accept that!  
  
Moreover, if using EAs running 24/5... I always recommend to close them on weekends, f. i. especially on this weekend with german SPD GROKO decision and Italian election...!

All I want to say is that we should be careful before going live. As we didnt solve the DD issue yet. We had several hedging ideas. The other idea was to force close all trades after throwing bones and Tarrot cards. Are there other ideas? The problem with hedge is the exit strategy.

But didn't Fx2 trade EURCHF, EURGBP and USDJPY - didn't see mention of EURUSD. Also hard to simulate what he did with the pipstep changes per sessions and red new patrol..... However I do get your point on the parallels of live trading this sort of bot.

Buddy...we should keep thinking positive and appreciate the work of the Threadstarter, our coders and traders who show us results and setfiles of their real EA trades. We have to accept that there is no Holy Grail in Forex or otherwise and probably no profitable set-and-forget EA over the long run in the financial markets.  
  
We must acknowledge... that from time to time manual intervention is needed because the markets are changing permanently what we have to take into account as well. If you are interested in the opinion of a generally recognized expert regarding automated systems, please look here:

In my personal option and from my own experience i think you should change currency pairs during the week to avoid blowing your account. I traded usdjpy and it blew my account twice in one week so I have decided to stay away from that pair. Again i don't think this is an EA that you could just leave it on and forget about it you need to monitor tweak the settings up a little and adapt it.

Take note that settings are not equal for each pair , a quick backtest with so much mismatch errors is mostly useless ...especially if you test these settings with a spread of 0.2 pips --( 2 points selected in your backtest) . Try to get free tick data from Birt data suite ( free 15 days trial period - Thanks Andrew) or get Tickstory Lite  
free always . Then redo the test and share here but with a normal spread on EURUSD something like 5 or 8 points ( 0.8 pips) ..this will be more valuable , than to add  
more "bricks" to the wall , discouraging guys coming here that might have some positive ideas to share and could add amazing forward DEMO testing.  
  
There will always be "nee"ers.

you are looking for 21/23 % monthly return...as there is no trading on Weekend. Of course 20-23% per month is possible ...how much do you want to risk ? your full  
1k ?. The more you want in return , the more you risk . Keep this as a poster on your wall. Maybe you should look for signals zulutrade ??

Galera I am restructured a new EA to make me more professional.  
The idea is to couple modules and ideas faster to test various techniques and ideas in a single EA project.  
I'll post the code on GitHub to focus on single-point all versions without having to be looking post-post.

Hi, thanks to all who are putting in work in this EA. Just wondering if functionality was needed to not trade on red news days, I recently found FFCal indicator that can be used to provide an input for when red news will hit. Will attach it below, all credits go to the original author.

Hi guys.   
  
I realised my hedge document wasn't clear in terms of what I want from the hedge system.  
  
I've now edited the document with a step by step section at the end and example scenarios. Hopefully this make more sense for our coders.  
  
Thanks

Receipt for dummy crash test ...it was a dummy test right ?  
  
EURJPY(dangerous) starting lot 0,03( very dangerous) with a 400$ balance _is insane_. More over with 3 pips grid/tp ...no 1 candle only filtering.....

Ok , looks nicer, although undercapitalized for ANY pair , 3g/tp3 settings are great for a hit and run strategy ...double the account withdraw , double or triple withdraw.  
Another approach to treat with grid/marty. Just not my style.

I started from 0.01 lots and if my margin level below 500%. I was stoped this EA.  
All setting is default. Filter max spread 20 because spread pair EURJPY on my broker is 12.

you need more than 400 dollars to try this ea you are over going to over leverage your account with just 400. We have agreed as a community that the best way to start is with 5000k and trading with one pair.

hi stefdek,  
Would you explain the difference between 3 grid size & 3 tp? Shouldn't they always be the same or how does it work otherwise?

example when EA trade level 8 or higher so this EA stop trading.

As my understandings, 3 grid size means EA open an order if distance to latest order is equal or more than 3 pips. 3 tp mean EA will set TP price to BE + 3pips.  
If I was wrong, please other people correct it.

That's easier said than done, my friend...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60f.png?v=15.1)!  
  
There is no "best" setting for everyone and at all events...you have to do your homework (f. i. back/forward testing) to find the settings which fit to your account size, trading style, risk assessment, broker etc...successful trading is no easy game, it is a very hard job! 

I never lose - either I win or I learn...

Hi,  
I think you have understood something wrong here, my friend.  
We are not here to give you best settings, but to make suggestions on How to improve the EA.  
It is a grid EA, you can loose as much as you can win.  
You have already asked - not one time.  
Members here have already shared their live results and suitable settings, please stop asking greedy questions.  
[You said you have lost already 400$?! your behaviour is best example on how not to do it.] 

Check page 1 for all infos...

What is your point of putting such comment here? Are you saying that all the EA in this thread are junk? Have you even tested them before you pass such judgement? Or perhaps you have a better EA to share with us else just don't.....!!!

sorry my friend don't get hurt..what i am trying to say is that most of the time EA's don't really works usually it will fail unless you do semi-automated..

I'm currently forward testing the "old" Trio Orchestra (thx stefdek) since yesterday Asia session, first 6 hs on M5 and then switching to M15 TF. The main differences to the xBest EAs are the entries with up to 3 trades and for me most importantly the exits. As you may see on the open positions... many have longs and shorts simultaneously...thus virtually an EA internal hedging. That means to get the possibility to make money on both sides of markets and moreover reduces the DDs strongly. You may recognize that on the green net pips and the low margin of 160€. Hence trading gets somehow more comfortable.  
  
Of course, I also know ...a 2 day test is not very convincing but nevertheless gives on the other hand some clues...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60f.png?v=15.1)!

What if you guys used partition close on the trades to close early trades. Maybe is better then using hard tp to close the trades. it will give more air to the hole basket and could give room for opening more trades if it goes the wrong way.

This is my goal. Perform EA tests such as letting an engine act on purchase (Trend Major Time) and another on sale to override the DD (Less Time Trend).  
  
While the motor that follows by the moving average of greater time with its high lots the sale engine makes grid of the opposite side until the quantity of lots are equal to the other motor  
  
Another idea is to make grid Hedge in triangular pairs. So one pair protects the other (theoretically)  
EXAMPLE  
// EURUSD BID - USDJPY ASK - EURJPY ASK  
// EURUSD ASK - USDJPY BID - EURJPY BID

We should consider to add SL on trade. Because i hit myself to ea and close this one big loss. Then ea continue without touching. Or hedge position, but keep in mind with margin.

The original trio dancer is based on three classic Ilan motors but with different input signals.  
A Hi / Low or other RSI use of H1 and the other Candles Lock in same position.  
  
The Ea I'm building will follow the same concept but with different engines and strategies as well. all modular to test the most diverse combinations so that one completes the other.

Will these be a different ea compared to the one I’m running. I’m running the lastest xbest. I’ve noticed that it’s a little bit safer but it’s slow at making the pips. Sometimes it takes at least an a coupe hours just to make pips but once it’s started it gets started I do like xbest and I’ve even though about doing it live with 3k.

I preferred the original entries of trio dancer as well. Can we not have an option of choosing one of the two entry methods? Lot of work to code in. Thank you for all your effort Rodolfolm..

Mate, what does consolidation mean? Markets are moving in swings (Elliott Waves). We definitely need this volatility to be profitable on these EAs. We can measure that volatility by ADR/ATR. Without some volatility it is difficult to make money in any market.  
Hence...we have to adjust our EA settings to the volatility of the respective currency pair. Doing that we may trade any pair. The more pairs we are trading in a basket the more they should balance out among themselves...IMHO.  
For instance, I'm using ATR-based settings on pip step and TP differently for every currency pair, f. i. 200% ATR in pips on M15 TF periods 3000 and a quarter or half of that pip value for TP. You may adjust those values to your risk tolerance and capacity for suffering drawdowns...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60f.png?v=15.1).  
  
Happy trading, jdva

first of all, i am very thankful to orchestra team, who have made such efforts to make this winning EA, i checked both orchestra and xbest ea, but i feel orchestra is better than xbest, and i am getting only one problem in orchestra that it is opening 3 orders at one price

Great job rodolfolm on the weekly updates you have been great to the community. I'm wondering what is different between xBest 2.22 and xBest 3.4 ?? I've been running 3.4 for the whole week and it is great just wondering what is the difference between both? which one is best to use.

3.4 I implemented the idea of Hedge with two xBest engines but it is not 100%.  
v3.4 : you can enable xBest 1 [buy only] or xBest 2 [Sell only]  
or both or if disabled works the same as xBest 2.21 (default)  
I just added the functionality in xBest 2.22 because the consequence of many engines in a single EA I am working on the MindStorm project

@rodofolm Mindstorm is really really really interesting idea, I am currently looking through your code to see how to test it. "In theory", there should be very very very little "drawdown" if it does what it suppose to do.  
  
Best Regard,

well guys just using default setting keeping lot size to 0.01 and using lot percent  
time frame is 15 minutes,currently using it on eurusd usdjpy gbpusd audusd usdcad eurgbp eurjpy  
make sure you have a unique magic number for each pair and also for both engine sell and buy shoud have a unique magic number  
am using [pepperstone](/brokers/pepperstone "View Pepperstone Broker Profile") broker by the way  
that all guys will keep you guys updated

It is a numerical ID that can be "stuck" to an order for the purpose of identification. This way a robot can distinguish its orders from other orders in the system (i.e. another robot or human) and coexist..

Hi Shnopse,  
  
Thanks for sharing the details but I still have few questions for you:-  
  
1) You said you used defaulted settings apart from the engine A sell and engine B buy being enable. How does it work, are they running parallel at the sametime? Do you not require to set your hedging level and the spread?  
  
2) How do you define those unique magic numbers ? Honestly I do not know how these magic number works hence i do not mess with them unless i can understand.   
  
Thanking in advance for answering my queries. Cheers.

yes when you set a different magic number for both sell and buy it works and open orders in both ways..that's how it manage to make profit  
yes they run at the same time...nop i didn't set any hedging level,the robot does what it suppose to do by it self....  
for magic number its just so that robot don't get confused that way a unique number is required  
for example sell magic number is random 111 for buy 112   
that's all as long as u keep your lot size to 0.01 i think this robot will be profitable in a long term  
most important don't interfere with the robot or change anything except for what i have said..and also make sure use a vps for that or turn your pc 24/5 a week   
avoid closing and opining it as this might affect the robot  
all the best   
cheers

Mate..very well done ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)!  
  
You are the first and only one who is providing us with an exact information about a proper setup on EA RV3.4 for using it on the two incorporated engines as well...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60b.png?v=15.1).  
Profit factor and DD are excellent and much better than my results getting on the simple Trio EA using it on a basket with pairs almost similar than yours.  
  
Stay tuned and have a nice weekend, jdva

I was running xbest 2.2 with relative drawdown - and it kicked me out because that was the max. dd. I set in the settings - and so much hoped that someone is trying xbest 3.4, since it is already in the thread for a month... good to have such a result! thumbs up...

Hello expert coders,  
Please see attached ex4 file (mql4 is not available) of an EA that I got from another forum.  
When I made several backtests, all of them were making profits. No big drawdown.  
But it seems that it has some bugs since it is not opening any positions in a live account, as per the entleman who placed the EA in other forum.  
Please, our expert coders have a look into it. Probably you could convert it to a promising EA.  
Thanks and regards,

One possibility to reduce max drawdown, is to get rid of those positions that fall short of the reach of takeprofit (they will not yield profit anyway). This will of course reduce profit. For some sort of compensation, the takeprofit can be extended. Not sure how this would pan out in the (thick) end though. Unless I'm mistaken.

In that case there is no difference (in the trading logic) to any prior versions. Likely not taking account of occuring commissions either. Kind of pointless. MT4 tester is so bogus.  
  
I use my own tester, which does it right. With real ticks that I collect from my broker.  
Though I use a modified entry system, tests suggest that a higher RR ratio (i.e. lower grid size and higher takeprofit), and with lower multiplier, will yield good results with reduced risk. TF M5.

I understand that. Yet the data knows no commissions and slippage. Strategies that hunt for only few pips at a time (like the one we are talking here) are extremely sensitive to cost of trading (commission, slippage, spread). Therefore real life results will differ greatly to those of testing, especially from bad testers, like MT4 tester (even with tick data - albeit ticks are of course much better).

Your test doesn't contain January 2017, if you open your test file, it started from August 1st 2017 (see below screenshot captured from your test results). Please try to test January and June 2017 again. Most Martingale type EAs failed in these two months.

I see, I did test from 01-08.  
  
Any i see your point. It could also be a good noticeable addition to this strategy.  
  
What I have noticed from Jan 2017, EU is on BUY Trend on Weekly chart.  
  
BUY engine of this EA survived very well. But Sell option is counter trend, and Martingale died Opening position in Feb and it kept the positions open until May and died.  
  
Where as BUY engine, it did very well, when it worked in Trend.  
  
I guess, we need to look an option to check which trend the market is and only use that option.  
  
I need to do a bit more detailed analysis of the results, to see if can we use Daily Chart trend.  
  
For Weekly Chart Trend- it is ZZ Indicator or simple trend line would give that.

The idea of 3.4 is good, If you look at my comments in above section..  
  
If BUY or SELL option is used based on Bigger time frame Trend, then we can getting good results using only 1 Engine instead of 2.   
  
And we switch modes, when the trend changes. IT would yield far better results with relatively low drawdown compared to using both options.

Disable RSI check- change it to false, also change MA Signal check from Current 3 to 4HR 17, you shall see a big difference. This part has been largely ignored. When it's trending up, RSI remains above 70 for very long period of time.

UJ Nov - Sell Engine - on from Nov through to March.  
  
Testing GU - Jan 2017 it is BUY trend. It should give better results.  
  
@gem.stocks, I will do as you suggested. It is important element. Martingale in a trend is a good friend. Counter-trend, it wouldnt be.  
  
4hr do you think would be a good one. MA would be unreliable for trend identification.

3.4 i dont see RSI Check option to make it false.  
  
And Are you refering to right now Moving average is based on Current Timeframe. - so we test it on 4hr and then MA period should 17 instead of 34.  
  
Is there a reason for 17 instead of 34.?  
  
Trend in Daily is far better than 4hr. But, I think change should be which engine to run based on the trend.   
  
I still do not agree with MA being trend identifier. It changes too slow.

And Are you refering to right now Moving average is based on Current Timeframe. - so we test it on 4hr and then MA period should 17 instead of 34. Is there a reason for 17 instead of 34.? Trend in Daily is far better than 4hr. But, I think change should be which engine to run based on the trend. I still do not agree with MA being trend identifier. It changes too slow. {image}

No RSI for this version, I was talking about the xBest 2.2 version.  
  
For this version 3.4, Using default setting single engine with $1K would blow out the account for Jan 2018 on 15M EURUSD quickly. With default settings, enable Buy and Sell engines, the account also blow out after several more days Jan. However, after changed to the following settings, using 4H 17 MA and step size to 10 and take profit to 7, the draw down dropped to a very small amount and it generated a profit and a good PF. Do a test and compare the result.

The truth is, it is easy to look back and say the trend was up or down, can you tell UJ or GU trend will be up or down from today toward next month or more? :-)

Bad, BAD idea!  
  
NEVER take a bonus from a broker!  
  
Read their terms and conditions - you will need to trade a multiple of the bonus (usually something like 10,000 times) in volume before they will let you withdraw your funds. E.g. if the multiplier is 10,000, for a $147 bonus, you will need to trade over $1,470,000 before they will let you withdraw any profits.

gem.stocks, thanks for your parameter settings.  
This is good example to prove right settings of parameters is the key for a successful EA.  
Also I got similar result when I did a back test.  
Do we have anywhere written the definition of each parameters of this EA ?

Thank you very much for taking the time explaining. I see that the default option is number 2. What are the options for this parameter? Example if I choose 0, 1, or 2?  
  
Lastly this maybe a silly question but what is qtd?

Hi,  
if you want a truly good MA as trend id, then please search for Jurik Filter (JMA).  
This is a real good one.

I do not have any optimized parameters yet. For now I am focused on implementing several functionalities (Modules) in the MindStorm project, yes, with N possibilities of Grid, Filters, Signals and etc. I will run the optimization. =)

Would it be possible to have a total profit option added to 3.41. In the display I can see that you are already counting it in Profit/Loss for A and B combined. Many times you can see that the total is in profit and I would like to be able to close at that point preventing the other one generating more losses if the price continues to move to the other direction. Thank you.

GU, it does manage the risk well. But Drawdown is still around 30-40%.  
  
I see all of these engines still doing only BUY. There is not sell positions or Short positions.  
  
Thanks for the MACH3 & MACH2 Differences.

Hey Stefdek,  
  
I was working with it too, I have multiple versions of the EA if you need me to post them, however they all contain the same issue.  
  
Also, the originator of the EA basically used everyone to modify and then disappeared...??   
  
Pipster59 was actually working with the person directly on adding news to the EA, he also has an EA that we wanted to combine with Pipbeast to improve the issue with DD, because as you clearly stated, if you use this EA wrong it will wipe you out! Happened to me on my first DEMO Account!   
  
All I get is some weird code when I try to modify, and I am not familair with the programming console aspect of MT4/5... So...  
  
Great to see someone took the initiative to restart this, it has so much potential if we can just work out a few issues!  
  
Best regards

MACH3 default settiings.  
  
Still only BUY.  
  
@rodolfolm Can you tell me any reason on BUY only vs SELL as well. Or is it something to do with Bigger Trend.

Yes...Mach2 took only longs too... although MA filter disabled, TP value seems to be in points not pips!?  
  
Edit: just got one sell on EJ...

In backtesting the 3.41 does not close all trades from both A and B engines when TP is hit. However, in live trading it seems to be working as intended.

Today I did a littel bit of a robot shoot-out, forward test (time: ~0700-2000 CET): xBest RV3.41 (both engines on, all else @default) vs Ilan 1.8 (posted in this thread) vs my own beast: xBest did not perform very well (cannot recommend); Ilan is far better; and my own the best (and there is room for improvement!).  
Here the result, all net negative pips attributable to xBest. Without xBest, net profit would have been at least 50% higher. It is not really surprising, xBest's decision logic is very primitive. TF was M1. BTW, account is like 30% up, despite heavy robot testing. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

Trade explorer added. Gprime ECN on VPS. At this moment only 2 pairs. And XBest V2.2.  
  
AUDJPY : will dance mostly during Asian session  
GBPCHF : same during London session  
WTI USOIL : to be added anytime theses hours.  
  
Theorically: non correlated pairs ( to avoid account OVERexposure to a specific currency) and a commodity ..so, not all eggs in a same basket.  
Settings ( will share here in next posts) , should provide a 10-15% monthly with an average DD each of MAX 35%.So,I agree this DD might be higher then  
the one year 28 Feb 2017 to 7 Feb 2018 tested with tick data suite (Birt´s). Backtests did not took under consideration , slippage , comissions , swaps.  
Starting balance is 5,000 ( $cents) DEMO.According to what I saw in my backtests ...these pairs are not trending at the same time during past year and do not  
have the same momentum.I guess ( or pray...lol) that both trending at the same time will not occurs ...till I have doubled the balance to withstand this.  
No news filter, one trade per candle, MA 58 direction , max spread filter on , grid spacing > 20 pips.

These are the settings I am using on DEMO in the TRADE EXPLORER ( TE) attached to this thread .....  
  
BEWARE : theses settings are NOT perfect , they were found backtesting and optimizing on my Broker which name is on my TE. This is an ECN broker and MIGHT NOT  
work very well with your broker...  
Try to use Birt data suite ( tick history) ...there is a 15 days demo free period there where you can download all historic tick data for whatever pair,cfd,commodity you want to test. ( Thanks for the tip Andrew-) .  
  
Once you have downloaded the data suite...restart your MT4 platform ....open strategy tester and you will have a new dropdown button here :  

Attached Image

![](/attachment/image/2714236?d=1520913255)

  
You will then have more accurate results in both backtesting and optimization than using mt4 history buid-in tools.  
  
When testing do NOT forget to look at your spread for each pair tested. Strategy tester spread is in POINTS ( not pips ..thanks Cescof) , so make your calculations  
accordingly ...add few points for slippage ... AUDJPY backtested with 10 points (1 pip) while my ECN broker has ( 0,5 pips/points) ...the spread meter is provided  
into your MT4 platform indi´s ..and it is just to confuse you a little more ....I will try to find here at FF a better spread indi ..wether in pips or point.

Mach2 mindstorms is really fantastic.But ı can critisize it on some perspectives.  
  
1-There is no need more filtrations.According to me it louds options table.Hi- lo critere is enough.There is no need equity coution and other filtrations(time volality news spread filtrations are useless according to me).  
2-İf we can see hi lo or moving avarage on the graph it would be better.  
  
Rodolpho thanks for your efforts for this EA.İ will evaluate it much by working on it timely.

You can always disable those filters if you don't want them. I only the otherhand would appreciate those options during forward testing. You nver know when the market sentiment spike whenever there's news impact. So is better to stay away from trading for that moment.

İ have an idea for Mach2 mindstorms EA;Can we add such an option; Open Hedge order when drawdown passes X(For example 100) loss with the half of absolute value of the difference lot of orders(buy and sell orders).This hedge order will work on seperate engine and will be closed when DD comes to Y(50).İf DD goes 200 then another Hedge order will be openned with same principles and first one will be closed.This will limit the losses and perhaps will develop profits also.

Hi Rodolfo,  
  
are you actually still working on that hedge option quoted and if yes, could you make any progress? I expressly appreciate your working on new EAs but.. IMHO I think we should first try to improve the older ones, otherwise we may lose track of the entire project.  
I have forward tested RV3.4 (BTW I like the max. lotsize feature which I'm missing in RV2.2) with the two engines activated but was not very successful. Those two engines seem to operate not very smart as you have already said yourself. Hence I believe a good hedging function like above from **dutchmen** and/or from **bgntrs** would help very much to reduce the DD and allow the EA to survive a longer time!  
BTW...I like the TE and backtests of stefdek...because they provide some important clues for us.  
  
Stay tuned and good luck for your demanding work...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60b.png?v=15.1) jdva

These filters are just parts to mount the EA. I'm creating the parts (Signals, Filters, Motors) and then I define whether or not I use EA similar a Lego.

Sure.  
I will be carefully.  
So can you add parameter stop trade when reach level (example when trade level 10 etc so that EA stop trading)?  
Can you correction about take profit in xbest v2.25,.when trade level 1 is TP 3 but when trade level above 1, space take profit is wider than old EA

An equity profit target closing all trades when target has been reached would be quite useful as it could be used to substantially lower dd when there is a strong trend.

A very effective protection against GAP contingencies, is keeping the take profit very large and working with trailing stop with both BUY and SEL orders at the same time. If there is a GAP in the price the take of the favored position will not be reached and the other will make the basket to win. Think about it.

I sure hope its not real money that you put in. By looking at your statement, I know you don't really understand what "xbest" is about. I put xbest 2.21 on five different demo account at the same time for three weeks and I haven't understand it all. If its real money, cut the loss and do more research and test it on demo before you put actual put hard dollars into play.

I really hate it just hand it out to someone that don't do the work and asking everything without putting in effort (not you BTW). I was ex-coder, so I know the kind of effort that @rodolfolm put in, so please ask me in private.   
  
**BE aware,** it's more risky than default setting. If I have to rank it from 1 to 10 for the risk 1 is smallest risk and 10 is biggest risk. The default setting is like 2 my setting is like 6 and the other one I have is like 8. Just want to clarify

@rodolfolm I am trying not to step on your toes here, because you are doing most of the leg work here, but I am going to recommend the following.   
  
Instead of release the feature as often as you can, try have a list of features and a set of milestone. You have to decide which feature is going to be on which release cycle. Because this is a money making EA, so people need time to back test and forward test the EA once you release it. If you release it too often, we are not finishing testing a version of EA and the new one came out in between. This is a way to ensure the quality of the EA and save time for everyone. You should not use the coding mentality for ex. website to use it on EA. It's ok to have an error in the website(not where it involve money), but not for the EA. People need to test the EA extensively before they can put actual money into it. If its all good, when they start making money, they can start give donation to you for your work.   
  
For example, I am still testing 2.21 and I already saw bunch of other modify version came out. It takes at least a month or so to fully forward test the EA and understand how it reacts in different market condition for the non coder or for coder for that matter. So I guess it would be good idea for you to set something like a monthly release cycle, if that works for your schedule.   
  
Best Regard,

Hi wkendwr...in most points I agree with you!  
  
We should going forward step-by-step to improve an existing EA and not 2 steps at once...IMHO. New features/functions are fine once we have first got the former ones.  
Honestly, I feel somewhat overtaxed with new features as long as I do get no detailed explanation how they work and how to setup them. Perhaps for a coder much is natural but unfortunately not for a dumb trader like me...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60f.png?v=15.1)!  
I think we absolutely need a working hedge function but so far I don't have got an answer on my inquiry in my **post #834**...but there's still hope...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60b.png?v=15.1)!

Hi guys - A bit of analysis for your thoughts...  
  
I've been using 3.4 for the past month on a small live account with fairly tight parameters, but have let the grids build by themselves while I simply monitor them.  
  
===========================  
Parameters: All defaults except:  
**Moving Average Period** :34  
**Percent Lot** : 1  
**Grid Increment Factor** : 1.1  
**Daily Target in Money** : 50  
===========================  
Took 341GBP to 533GBP (56.3% gain) in 12 days, then lost 97GBP (18.2%) on 13th day (today)  
  
I have tried not to let my psychology get the better of me (it's real money after all!), but have now closed two grids manually due to me losing faith that they were going to recover. In both cases, the grids went over 7 trades deep and ran for in excess of 12 hours.  
  
I have also resisted using the Equity Stop function for now, instead trying to build up a view of how far I should let a grid run before it starts to run into trouble, or becomes counter-productive to let continue.  
  
Today I closed my latest grid, which had gone to 10 trades before I closed it, for an 18% loss (that's not as bad as it sounds, as I am still up over 18% for the month anyway), and have now gone back over my trades and performed some analysis on the grid sizes, and what I have found is:  
  
128 Grids in total, consisting of:  
  
1 trade: 76 (59.4%)  
2 trades: 31 (24.2%)  
3 trades: 12 (9.4%)  
4 trades: 7 (5.5%)  
7 trades: 1 (0.8%)  
9 trades: 1 (0.8%) - 18% loss due to closing manually  
  
Based on the above, I now feel confident that limiting the grids to just 4 trades in total (close on 5th open) should be far more profitable (not to mention less nerve-wracking) than letting them run, as those that exceed this number either take an exceedingly long time to close in profit (time which could be used to place single profitable trades) or signify that the trend has changed and the grid is now on the wrong side of the market, and may have to be closed manually for a large loss.  
  
I'd appreciate any feedback on this line of thinking.

Next release I will implement.  
I just added the buttons to test the strategies faster on the backtest and also because it was a stefdek request.  
I'm evolving these EA's just to see what's really possible.  
Afterwards everything will be evolved into the MindStorm Project where anyone can create their EA just by assembling the pieces: adding Engines (xBest, Ilan, TrendFolow, NewsFolow, PendentGrid), Sensors (News Sensor, Volatilidad Sensor, Time Sensor, Sensor Signals, Risk Sensor, Speed Sensor) and remote control (Buttons)

Rodolfolm ı had suggested a hedge plan for Mindstorms EA v1.İ think if we make it succesfully it would be more fantastic.Hedge orders may be like buy or sell stop orders with the last openned normal order 's lot and with its stop loss.İt will be closed by its profit on the time new normal order openned.And new hedge stop order will be placed to some pip far from that openned order.There may be some losses perhaps but it would be more secure.  
We can use other type of hedge order also.İts up to you but İ think hedging will be very well to that EA

This is one of the reasons I really don't like to disclose the setting I test on in public. Seriously, if you don't contribute, than leave.

This has been my first week using the EA and the truth is that I am very happy. I have made some modifications, intervening manually, and the results have been very good. I started with an account that had something over $ 1000.

you will lose,, today or tomorrow but you gonna lose following something like this except if you know when the snake moves up or down  
but if you know that you wont need robots or even ff forums  
if you know that you just open your chart and make one million or something like that daily ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
  
we try robots and any kind of tools, charts etc... because we don't know when the snake move up or move down, that's why you never see a successful trader on forums, they don't need forums, i think they don't even know what is a forum ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

You sounded like you are a successful trader...or not? Can you just stop insulting other people's hard work and go find something better to do?

ok.Thanks for sharing your mood.Although not very usefull to understand what happened to have 3 accounts blow in a week. Do you agree you are doing something wrong ? Or you think it is bad luck ?. Maybe you should create a trade explorer here, so we can have a look and try to correct you.  
There is nice settings here for EURUSD , ONE trade per 15 min candle , shared by cdsaa :

This is around 22% monthly, starting with 1,000$ (cents) ..made 1,586$ gain in 7 months ( 158% / 7 = 22% average) , beware almost 50% DD but no account blowing.

Well in my past posts I have shared my settings where I'm using .03 lots with 3k account and trade candle false.I think the EA was on the wrong side of the dollar rally all three times it was blown it was by the dollar going up and it wasn't able to recover from being over margin. This week I'm thinking about using more conservative settings and letting it run with different pairs. I'm also going to see how it does with a 1.5k account and being conservative.Second, i have tried most of the setting here so its all about figuring out the right one. I'm still trying to figure out the difference between xbeast 2.2 and xbeast 3.4 to my understanding 3.4 has the option to let it have a buy and sell engine on at the same time? I just don't understand the setting about taking profit after 10 which it closes the trade before hitting the take profit but I feel like it over margin the account that way. Any help would be deeply appreciated. Thank you. and thank you, coders, for your hard work

Rodolfolm, your hard work and attitude of sharing is really inspiring, though I am not able to contribute anything here, as I am not qualified in these subjects. Pray that you keep up your good work.

This is an equity protection feature. Set it to 50% .... if by any chance Drawdown reachs 50% ..all trades will be closed to preserve your account to be totally  
blowed.  
  
Ex: trading a balance of 1,000 $ ...when equity is touching a thinny 500$ left to trade..all position are closed.  
Now , don´t ask me about caution daily or weekly , I did not understood this , not using , never explained by Rodolfo.

caution daily or weekly slow EA action. In cases of DD that reach this value the EA brakes and starts to execute only one operation per candle defined in this parameter. The price usually comes back in bigger times but sometimes it does not. Usually every graphic time has a zigzag  
  
Brokerage firms along with banks usually make sudden or high drops looking to break accounts of those who have little margin or who use martingale but usually these manipulations are only for a period because the price tends to follow an average by arbitrage between the other currencies correlated.  
  
It's like walking down a street with lots of holes. if you do not brake and go slow it will break your car.

Hello Abusaad412,  
The EA is not opening any positions.  
It's name is 'cm manual grid'. So, do we have to make any manual entries ? Please explain.  
Thanks

Hi Rodolfo,  
  
I'm on RV3.4 with 2 engines A and B activated on EG M15. Pips step is 12. Although there was a drop of more than 40 pips since last buy no new buys has been opened...instead however another sell!? Any idea why no buy? Margin lvel about 7000%! One trade per candle on, Caution/Equity stop filter false...

The A motor only acts when the signal is purchased and the B motor only acts when the signal is on sale. Motor A will only buy when the market presents the bullish signal. In the meantime he's only going to be selling.  
  
The idea is to prevent the martingale from creating many entries in the opposite sign.

Yes, this EA did very well. It was NOT opening any positions when price moved very fast in one direction (whereas another EA was making several trades).  
Actually that is what many of us were looking for.

you have active percent lot and no "Fixed Lot"... then the EA "takes" 0.31% of your account, it is 0.01 lots...  
you must to change to fixed lot, but I think is very high with 1000$.

To my understanding, when the EA is starting to only trade at one direction is because there was a fail trade which left open at the opposite direction.   
For instance when a buy trade was not able to close at TP level before market is trending down leaving a huge gap and large DD. The EA was smart enough to execute sale trades according to the market trend but unfortunately it does not able to offset to the initial buy trade that contributed large DD.   
However the EA does prevent executing anymore buy trades in a way to control the DD gap which is why at times the EA only trade at one direction and stop trading whenever the market is reverse as long as the DD still exist until the price level has recover back it's formal level.  
This is the only flaw i can see so far, if the price gap is too large to recover hence we may have to manually close the lost trade in order to get the EA run as normal unless we can suggest how to hedge the fail trade and auto close them when they have breakeven.  
  
I hope you can understand my explanation.

Due to the FOMC meeting tomorrow I closed my xBest v3.4 forward demo test starting last week monday prematurely. Both engines A+B activated, max DD 1,5%, max. margin used about 1200€ on a 50k account with 12 pairs on M15...running very stressfree 24/5 without manual intervention. I know not much profit in percent...I like more the money ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1).

Hi Rodolfolm,  
  
Looks quite sophisticating, keep up the great job.   
  
About the EA 3.46 version, could you kindly explain what is that HILO config means? Also, I realised the default settings for take profit in pips is 3000, is this by purposed/accident?  
  
Looking forward for your prompt feedback.  
  
Cheers.  
pete

HILO enabled case adds the HILO filter to the Signal beyond the moving average.  
  
Hilo uses two moving averages one in price PRICE_LOW and one in price PRICE_HIGH. If the Bid price is greater than the MM PRICE_HIGH Buying signal if the Bid price is less than PRICE_LOW Selling Sign.  
Understood?  
  
There are some calculations of indicators used as a sign that it is difficult to explain the complete formula in words.  
  
Yes, TrailingStop works better than takeprofit to my liking. but it is of taste.

Rodolform, thanks for your reply.  
If **TrailingStart** is TrailingStop, probably **Size Trailing Stop** is the step (increment factor) of it.  
Appreciate if you please confirm it.  
Thanks

Rodolform, thanks for your reply. But it seems there are some mistakes. Please see the screenshots of parameters and S/L of trade result.  
The step (increment) is happening in one (1) point (not in pip) whereas the set up for trailing stop was for 10 pips.  
  
Also, I think, the buttons of 'TrialingStart' and 'Size Trailing Stop' need to be interchanged.  
Please check.  
Thanks

MA58 means - Moving Average over last 58 candles.  
  
It is not crossing/intersection of MA 5 & MA8.

> {quote} HILO enabled case adds the HILO filter to the Signal beyond the moving average. Hilo uses two moving averages one in price PRICE_LOW and one in price PRICE_HIGH. If the Bid price is greater than the MM PRICE_HIGH Buying signal if the Bid price is less than PRICE_LOW Selling Sign. Understood? There are some calculations of indicators used as a sign that it is difficult to explain the complete formula in words. Yes, TrailingStop works better than takeprofit to my liking. but it is of taste.

Rodolfo...please can you check:  
  
If HILO is enabled=true and the Invert filter=true too...EA RV3.46 seems to open positions only with these options and NOT with the normal 34 EMA. After one hour starting just half of possible trades has been opened.  
  
Edit: If Invert filter is set to false...everything seems OK!

This configuration has just canceled the signal from each other. MA and Hilo ... So it will never have an input signal.

It looks promising. See the attached screenshots.  
It gives good performance for these pairs: EURUSD, USDJPY and GBPUSD even for a small account $500.  
It also gives the same performance for $1000, $2000 accounts. Of-course, the % of draw-down will vary accordingly.

I don't you will profit well on this.  
As your spread is 0. Means you are using ECN account. Have to minus off the commission.   
Some times commission is one of the issue. since the EA is not scalping, you may use normal standard account

See the result when the spread is taken as 10 points (1 pip) for EURUSD. There is no commission involved.  
But for EURGBP it is showing a loss due to heavy draw down.

You already have EquitySTOP so EquityTP would be the opposite of it. A Basket TP which closes all buy and sell trades would also be as good.

Hi Mavi ,  
  
if you keep keyboard CTRL key pressed while pressing Minus ( -) one or several times ....we will be able to see the whole picture of your tests. I do not know if test results are forr what version of EA ..and what pair tested ....  
  
As an example better to have ALWAYS the whole picture :

İ have an idea For the last version of the mindstorm EA.İ want to explain with an explanation.  
  
For example if sell orders come to X(for example 0.04 lot) then close the first openned 0.01 lot buy order with its profit then it would open new 0.04 lot buy order while its line comes to its near.İf prices goes up and new orders will be openned and when 0.08 lot(After another 0.04 lot) sell order openned then other 0.04 lot buy order will be closed with its profit and new 0.08 lot buy order openned and line will come to its near.  
  
İ hope ı could tell what ı ment.

I'm not sure if my copy of xBest RV3.46 is working correctly, or if I've got a setting wrong...  
  
I have grid size set to 3 with TP set to 3, but it seem to leave a gap of between 5 and 7 pips between the first and second orders. Also, when the second order is placed, the TP is only pulled back by 1.5 pips, and when the third order is placed (usually around 4 pips from the second) the TP is only pulled back about another 0.5 pips.  
  
Any ideas what I should be looking at to maybe change to make it stick to the 3x3 setting?

Hello Stefdek, Thanks for the info. I didn't about that. I will do that next time when I post a test result.  
  
See attached screenshot of live trades of last few hours of MACH2_MindStorms.  
Also see attached Excel spread sheet which is a statement of closed trades, which are not bad. All of them were with SL, so well protected.  
The problem-ones are, among open positions, there are trades without SL. It would be wonderful if this issue is managed.

"TP in percentage of capital" may have some issues when there are multiple EAs running in one account.  
However, we can always make a trial-run and see the result. If possible, you can make option to choose - "TP in pips" or 'TP in percentage of capital"

Hi Mavi , you are welcome. if CTRL hold pressed & \+ ( plus) ..this will ampliate , enlarge your html page ( very usefull for very small characters) .  
OK, your trading test is DEMO , I am happy with this , since you are no crazy guy to jump into the friying pan. One observation though ,   
you are over exposed on the behaviour of the USD ( GBP _USD_ ,EUR _USD_ , _USD_ JPY) and with 900$ balance this is very risky....  
USDJPY , EURGBP , ( AUDNZD or CADCHF ?) would maybe stand as a better choice ...again , thanks for sharing.

more a preview..  
  
Sorry guys as requested by Thread starter I had to remove most of my mq4 files ( and few ex4 too) and from now on I will only be sharing ex4 with a 30 days trial period, so I can collect test results. Those sharing results or having a trade explorer running my EA´s will ask for an up to date version by PM...

Hi,  
See attached test reports of R3PTAR_MindStorms for GBPUSD, $1000 and $3000 accounts.  
It looks good, though the draw-down is a bit high. Still it survived well in a $1000 account.

Yes...RV3.46 don't work for me correctly either, considering to going back to RV3.4...but don't just know what that correction should mean:  
  
**Correction of the calculation of Pip in Spread in Grid due to correction of v3.43**  
**Correction of the calculation of Pip in Spread in Grid due to correction of v2.24**  
  
**On stefdek's TE v2.2...everything seems to work very well...without this correction...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60b.png?v=15.1)!**

It is stuck because it is a developing EA without its due tests.

Many people are downloading EA's but few are helping (backtest, Testing Demo, finding bugs, commenting, donating) I'm going to start distributing EA's just to those who are contributing to the project in some way.  
  
It is easy download and use and does not help at all. While others work to help.

Dear rodolfolm,  
  
I would like to test your EA with DAX (Ger30).  
  
Could you explain better each parameter ?

Rodolfo , I already told you , to stop sharing your mq4 files here . Only Ex4 with a 30 days expiry ...the one´s that share results can always ask for another 30 days  
period by PM´ing you. Without this you will only have lurkers , downloaders ...who just don´t share nothing .

good day everyone, my finding after tested on these EAs:   
  
Xbest2.2, just a purely martingale type scalper which can be very dangerous in trending market and eventually big drawdown will kill your account. If we expecting small drawdown in return we get a small return which becomes no more attractive.   
  
Xbest3.4, with added 2 engines buy & Sell, it does help in reducing drawdown, personally I like below setting where until today still in good profit but small drawdown:   
  
Micro account:   
Equity = 2000  
Lot = 0.02   
Exp = 2  
Pips = 6  
TP = 6   
Minimal profit closed = 1 (I reduced it from 10 to 1 as I assumed this will only work correctly for a micro account)  
Trailing stop = Off (it doesn't work correctly in the micro account, by right it should start to trail after reaching certain profit level, ex: trailing start 50, size 10, the Ea should start to trailing once the opened trade reaching 50 pips profit. But the EA now immediately put a stop loss at 10 pips to my opened trade even it still not reaching profit 50pips)  
  
MA  
34 Exponential & closed   
  
Hilo  
20 Exponential & closed with Inverter On. (with Inverter on, the EA will opened lesser trades but most of them are quality trades)   
  
Yet test on MACH, but I think Xbest 3.46 is good enough for me. I applied the EA to 6 pairs (live account) and now still enjoying average 0.6 - 1% return on daily basis.   
  
Thanks to Rodolfo for the hard works, appreciate!

It doesn't help much and instead will only dampen the spirit of open-source. Lurkers and downloaders do not slow or stop the progress of this project. We just need more people to come in and contribute, not only testers but also developers. Making it open-source allows other developers to look into the codes and fix bugs or propose ideas and hopefully can contribute back to the main project.   
  
I have proposed to Rodolfolm to create a separate thread in which the first post can be constantly updated with the latest files and information. As of now, one has to scan through the entire thread to find important information on how to correctly use this EA or any existing known issues. Also for what he has done thus far, it deserves a thread on its own, rather than within this "Trio Orchestra EA".  
  
I will try to contribute more from now onwards with my testing since my account finally allow me to post without sending to the moderation queue.

It's no use downloading with bugs and no tests. The higher the contribution the better the quality of EA. Unless you are downloading mt4 ,fixing errors and not sharing.

What version and name of EA will you test? Have to see if it works on Dax. Depending on the pair's digits it changes the calculations of the pips. I already made some corrections appeared other bugs already corrected. but it's cool to test.

Falcon, understand your point.Although you have to admit that there not much "share" here.  
Your "moderation limitation" has been lifted for more than a month now -after 10 posts- . Did you found bugs ? Did you test some of the EA here ? Results settings ?  
  
I browsed all your post here, just to be sure what kind of share spirit you have. Could not find ANY contribution ...except Thumb up ..or oohh that´s cool.  
  
Looking into the code to found bugs will always be available @Github where ( if you are a coder) Rodolfo will have a pleasure to answer your questions and you will be debating with him a few lines of "buggy" code.  
  
What I want here in the thread is maybe just a one share a week , maybe with sets files that could have a good R:R ...scanning the thread is good , so at least people  
takes time to read.  
  
In your posts you said you will be testing this and that and share results....but no results to display , not even one good or bad.  
  
About Rodolfo opening his own thread ..this is fine to me , and of course it would be natural as he is now far ahead of original TrioacctFk...r , but anyway this is still a grid rider , and Rodolfo might not have the time to attend his thread.  
  
Maybe you should open YOUR own thread and hire "my Rodolfo" ....lol . I will subscribe for sure and test/share if you do not ´ignore´me .  
  
Want to do something usefull for everyone here ? Just send some 100 bucks to his PP like (too) few of us already done here.

Hi Stefdek,   
  
I am not sure when the moderation limit was lifted but just a couple of days ago, my post is still being sent to the moderation queue. Sorry, my posting here is not as professional as yours since I am still new to trading but if my posting history is just showing "thumbs up", then something might be wrong. I guess my previous post might have "pissed" you off in some ways so I shall not elaborate any further as it adds nothing but fuel to the fire. Let's just let this thread continues its original purpose.  
  
Thanks.

I am in the demo account, version 2.2, for USD-JPY, time 3.14--3.25.Profit % 50.One currency pair.I will share my happiness.

I manually draw the slope of the higher time frame on MT5 with parallel direction.If you're going in a parallel direction, you're going to have a finite range of oscillations, and if you're going to have a slope, the force is always going to go in the direction of the slope.

Hi,  
Please see attached excel file for the live test result (from a demo account)(I am not sure if this is called forward test).  
R3PTAR_MindStorms_v1 (around 22 hours), for EURUSD.  
MACH2_MindStorms_v1 (more than a day), for 3 currency pairs EURUSD, USDJPY and GBPUSD.  
  
**In my opinion, R3PTAR_MindStorms_v1 performs better than MACH2.**

As a programmer, you should have a high degree.I have seen a picture before, I look for it, I don't know whether the graph can refer to the range and energy of the level.I'll find it.

I am running a forward test now on EURGBP, M15. Just a quick question, does the timeframe matters in the EA?  
  
Also would like to propose a trivial suggestion. Can you add the expiry date label onto the chart as well? Just to warn those who did not read that there is a expiry on this EA and use it on LIVE account till after the expiry.

I eagerly followed all posts, but didnt have time to donate, as I am very busy. I will have more time from the 1st of april though.   
  
The main points were the huge DD that I hoped we could solve. Tarot cards and throwing bones was a suggestion, but we couldnt really find a solution for it and I ran out of ideas. I thought of the loss recovery strategy, which swingman simplified. But it seems difficult to implement.   
  
Also, I loved the original trio dancer trade entry sequence, which I hoped you would add to the EA.   
  
will you share mq4 files with us?

What I do: I close positions that fall ouside the (newely set) take-profit level (a.k.a. "cut losers short"). They will not produce profit anyway and by doing so, there is never more than like 2 positions open.  
That way DD is reduced by like 50%. Needless to say that profits also melt, however, if take-profit level is set to be higher than grid size(i.e. 5 vs 3) and with a multiplier like 1.5 there is still enough profit, if one is not greedy. Also I open new "hedge" only on a new candle open, if by that the grid size is surpassed.  
Some other considerations: To make such a robot work in real terms (real money) I would not post the take-profit level to the market (a.k.a. stealth TP) and also jitter about the grid size. Ideally one would use it with MT5 (with its ability to send orders asynchronously) or any other netting platform.

> good day everyone, my finding after tested on these EAs: Xbest2.2, just a purely martingale type scalper which can be very dangerous in trending market and eventually big drawdown will kill your account. If we expecting small drawdown in return we get a small return which becomes no more attractive. Xbest3.4, with added 2 engines buy & Sell, it does help in reducing drawdown, personally I like below setting where until today still in good profit but small drawdown: Micro account: Equity = 2000 Lot = 0.02 Exp = 2 Pips = 6 TP = 6 Minimal profit closed...

Hi chuask86,  
Just a quick query about your settings on 3.46v do you set "true" for open by one candle as well, since you mentioned that setting with "Inverter on" would reduce number of open trades?  
I am currently still running backtest on this EA with mainly default settings except lot size is 0.10 mainly to test it's durability. So far it looks fine but the DD is getting higher in long run. Will post my result soon when my backtest finished.

I found the picture I said, I'm not a programmer, I can't describe it in programming language.Probably means the magnitude of the energy, and the level of energy.  
The future is unpredictable, and since I can't defeat it, I have a selective evacuation.  
I may not have the means and ability to make such a model.  
But I think it should exist, my thirst for knowledge.

Hi Pete,   
  
I am working on time frame M1, so the difference between True or False for open by one candle is not really significant.   
  
if you one using Lot size 0.10 it could be dangerous if you are working on the small capital standard account. I noticed there are sometimes where a big lot is opened after meeting certain trading conditions and the trade is to cover all the losses and make a huge profit, and here is where the big DD comes in.  
  
I am running the Xbest3.46 on micro account with equity around 1700usd, 6 pairs with initial lost 0.20, so far the profitability is okay and I am having average DD at around 30 - 40usd (2.3%). You may think I should increase the lot size so that I can have better profitability even with higher but reasonable DD, in my opinion, I will rather lowering down the size but having more pairs trading at the same time, as I believe not every pair will having high DD at the same time. I still running the forward test, hopefully, my account can survive with consistent profitability. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

I'm just new but here is an idea... What if you run the strategy knowing that your account will blow up?. I mean. You start, you have some profit and start to retire your gains. Always with a small account that you can replace. Just an idea...

Yes, I have close set to true.  
  
Yes, if I had left the trades running it would have eventually pulled back into profit (I'm running on EURGBP not EURJPY though), but that wasn't my point. My point was that I'd chosen a particular strategy (namely to close all grids that end up needing to open 5 trades or more - less than 2% of grids) and RV3.46 didn't work as I expected. The reason for my strategy (rather than just leave the trades to run) is because I've used grid traders and martingales quite a few times before, and have blown accounts, even on what was supposed to be very safe settings. I did have equity stop set on RV3.4 to 20% and that did stop (twice! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)), but 20% is too large for my strategy.  
  
I've been looking at the circumstances around this failure, and it looks like the large drawdown happened during the news filter being on. This would explain why it didn't open any more trades as the price dropped, but I still would have expected the equity stop to trigger, no matter what.  
  
I have reverted to RV3.4 and this is now opening trades with the requested grid size and TP. It seems to suffer from the same non-closure at equity stop during news or out of hours, but I can manage that manually, no problem.

I am currently still running backtest on this EA with mainly default settings except lot size is 0.10 mainly to test it's durability. So far it looks fine but the DD is getting higher in long run. Will post my result soon when my backtest finished.

I did try on default setting but found that the profitability is not there mainly due to grid increment factor = 1.1, the highest the increment factor the easiest the newly opened trade to cover the loss of previous trade and close all trades in profit.   
  
I am still not sure what is the purpose of "If true Invert Filter", but with series of BT on USDJPY since last year, month by month, with invert filter On, opened trades reduced, most of them are quality trades (mean need not to open more trades to cover the losses), and with lower DD. That's why I decided to make it On and see what happened on other pairs during the forward test.

> good day everyone, my finding after tested on these EAs: Xbest2.2, just a purely martingale type scalper which can be very dangerous in trending market and eventually big drawdown will kill your account. If we expecting small drawdown in return we get a small return which becomes no more attractive. Xbest3.4, with added 2 engines buy & Sell, it does help in reducing drawdown, personally I like below setting where until today still in good profit but small drawdown: Micro account: Equity = 2000 Lot = 0.02 Exp = 2 Pips = 6 TP = 6 Minimal profit closed...

I guess you know...if HILO inverter is on, you don't get any signal from the MA, pl. look at post #952. BTW...in my tests the original 3MA does work better than the 34MA and also without the HILO entry option I get better results. Unfortunately, although fixed lot=0.02 set...EA RV3.44 motors/engines A and B open only each 0.01 lot. Perhaps Rodolfo may help. Hence DD is very low but profit as well, you may recognize that on the very high green net pips:

Yes, I do agreed with you 3MA does work better than the 34MA as more trades were opened but other words its subjected to a higher risk, especially when you applied it on GBPJPY, spike and big DD do come anytime. I prefer to have a lesser but profitable trades so that I need no to worry too much when my account will be blown out ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f606.png?v=15.1)  
  
Yes, I am wondering too, why there is a trade with 0.01 lot? where these 0.01 trades don't contribute in averaging the loss or profit making.

With the Mach2_MindStorms_v2 there has got to be a way to drop all the trades that are left after a pair breaks a trend. You have the equity stop that will close all the trades after a % drawdown is hit but it stops trading. It should wait for say 10 mins then resume trading. trader should be able to change wait time 

Happy Hunting!!!

Running Mach2 set equity stop at .10%. it drops the losing shorts keeps the winning longs but waits an hour to resume trading. Trader should be able to shorten or lengthen this wait time.

this is a backtest run. Working on eliminating the drawdown. I was wrong about the time it waits. It was 6 hours before it started up again. the second chart, after it hit the equity stop the second time it totally stop trading. not getting any errors in the journal it just keeps saying close all to stop out? Sorry if im posting to much just trying to help out. Test result graph posted with these setting in have.

I have to admit , that this is happening even in the earliest versions of Xbest ( v2.2) ...I sometimes have to "kick-ass" the ea to trade ...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60e.png?v=15.1). I look at my TE or Myfxbook ..and if there is GBPCHF XTIUSD or AUDJPY pair missing ( I mean in a trade) ...I go o my pc ( when possible) , look at the chart and switch time frame  
and a trade open within the next 10-15 seconds ... for me this is a minor bug.I only trade 3 pairs with the settings I found ( and shared) that will produce 25-40% monthly with a max DD of 35%.If AUDJPY just stops for a while this is no big deal , it eventually get back few hours after. Maybe when Rodolfo have time he will have  
a look on this topic as it seems that it affects all the Xbest and Storms series ( not tested by me...yet).

Hi Stefdek & Rodolfolm,  
  
  
Why do we need so many tests on the same, because for the sake of posting something, ppl are now going to post something or other to please you. Do you need it.  
  
Out of 100, if there 10 or 15 who are quality users, who want to use your EA, we will provide and add comments to improve on it. Or else we will get more junk, and quality will go down on comments and questions.   
  
At the end of the day, it is your work & thread.   
  
I am seeing a good interaction on some of the points going towards a good solution. Don't worry about lurkers, they wont make much difference.

Update...it is a pity...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61f.png?v=15.1)! Green net pips are about 10 times the profit but I cannot gain more of it because the engines A+B are opening only 0.01 lot each, fixed lot=0.02 already set, might percent lot setting help? Margin used never went above 50€ and max DD 120€...hence only a low account size should be needed!  
  
**Please...can anyone tell me how to increase the lotsize of the engines?**

@rodolfolm @stefdek   
  
I totally support the effort to give it only to someone that is willing to contribute, I think 30 days is a pretty good period for testing a EA, if there's a special request to test the EA over the "Red Days", ask the author to make a change.  
  
BTW, my 1200 dollars on three pairs on EURUSD, USDJPY GBPUSD, a mid level risky setting that will return your money within a week, was doing well for two weeks, and it blow the account during the Red Day Week(19 to 23) when the English pound shoot up unexpectedly and EUR went on different direction.  
  
However, my 1200 account on EURUSD only on another DEMO account with HIGH-RISK setting, survive the week and give the give your money back within one week period. So, what I am trying to say is trying different setting and let it run through different market scenario, you will know the strength of the EA. It's all on xbest 2.21. Like I said in the past, it takes time to test.  
  
@rodolfolm I am going to try the compile your source from github, is there any way to drop a message to you, like a skype or whatsapp, if there is, please pm me,

@rodolfolm   
  
Please do listen to my advice, focus on few EA and maintains on few EA, improve feature on only few EA, I have been looking through your code @ github( I am ex-coder, so I am still learning MT4 syntax and libraries), there are too many small changes and project between github and here. I am willing to do the test work, so shoot me a message if test needs to be done.

Or else we will get more junk, and quality will go down on comments and questions. At the end of the day, it is your work & thread. I am seeing a good interaction on some of the points going towards a good solution. Don't worry about lurkers,...

It seems you have a point. I love the spirit of sharing, but as rodolfolm points out sharing should come from others as well.   
  
I do think that those who share are really interested in the EA and others who download it once, try it and just leave it in some folder and forget about it.  
  
I shared in the beginning of the thread and now I just dont have anything constructive that I could share. Should I clutter the thread with a desperate attempt to receive the EA. I dont think this helps at all.   
  
Who of you decides who is a good contributer? I am feeling a little dissapointed with this development. Even though I understand where you guys are comming from.  
  
Just not sure how to do it in a good way?? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f62d.png?v=15.1)

Yes, I do think quality contributors are hard to come by, there's saying in the developer world, one bad ass coder can do 10's works.

Hi Rodolfol, may I have your favour to my below queries :   
  
1\. I noticed that after few trades opened but the price goes against my direction, later when the price come back to my direction, a big lot was opened ex: 25, although its good to have this big lot to my direction and cover all the previous trades in the loss and closed them with good profit, what comes to my concern is what if the price continues against my direction, then I will be in deep trouble with big DD. Just want to further understand what circumstances the EA will open the big lot.   
  
2\. As mentioned by jdva, somehow there are small lots opened (0.01lot), though the initial lot set higher than this. Is it a bug?   
  
Thanks!

Hi Guys,  
  
As promised attached herewith my latest backtesting result for 3.46v. Unfortunately I just come to realise that my modelling quality is very low after taken days to complete the testing on 5m chart. Can anyone advise how should I obtain free quality data for testing as I'm not an expert on this backtesting?  
  
Anyway here are my findings so far:-  
  
EA seem work well trading according to MA trendline (or bollinger bands?) with a minor flaw that it still can incurred a left out open trade when market is going opposite direction resulting large DD despite trailing stop was applied as default settings.  
The pros is that it wont allow trades on opposite market direction when there's a DD incurred so as to minimize the DD level. The cons is that it does not know how to hedge/ contra off the lost trade with trades that were on the right market direction (bmcgowra idea seem not implemented successfully yet)  
  
Another interesting findings when i run this on forward testing as well, I can still get lost trades even though EA is trading on the right direction. I believe this is something to do with the trailing stop default settings?  
Currently in my forward testing, I got caught up between both buy & sell trade left open with moderate DD. As a result no further new trades been taken by the EA at this point which is gonna be slow turn over.  
  
My backtesting seem given much promising result than my forward testing but still it has huge DD towards the end (But then my quality modelling is low hence result is not too reliable)  
The only point I quite convinced is that this new EA wont easily blow your account away given the fact that I was begin with 0.10 lot size with high volatility pair and it still managed to complete my backtest period for 8 months in 5m chart regardless of the quality data.  
  
Here are some of my queries I need to get clarity:-  
  
The current version shows 2 separate fields for spread. I'm not sure how should i set for the max spread config now since both display at different decimal point.  
  
Must this EA applies with trailing stop so as to minimize number of open trades or can I set false to trailing stop ?  
  
Does the hedge option still working because I was told that trailing stop and hedge function does not work well together on previous version?  
  
Hope rodolfolm or anyone of u guys can help address my queries soonest possible and appreciate for the support given.

Sorry for the delay in answering. yes the open order in hedge decreasing the risk and controlling the DD. this when DD goes into caution equity.  
  
can be bug. I'm testing here to see if I can simulate.

Well sorry for the late answers. But let's go:  
  
The Spread I'm correcting. TrailingStop is more advisable for an unpredictable market. the initial Hedge done by xJhamil I do not know if it works, I did not test it. Between engine A and engine B works.

For tickdata please see <https://tickstory.com/product/tickstory-lite/>. I personally use Tick Data Suite from eareview.net. It is not free but worthwhile if you do a lot of backtesting.  
  
Based on my back testing, I can confirm that the 3.46 version leaves trades hanging sometimes. I will continue backtesting the new versions and report my findings.

Hello Petewong052,  
I have made only minor changes to the default settings.  
See attached screenshot where you can see the changes. All other parameters remain same.

@Mavilakandy  
  
Your settings for the R3PTAR_MindStorms v1.0 are good.  
  
I think Robolfolm has mentioned to use TP as bigger number and use trail. EU held up very well in 2017 right through the April/May/June period.   
  
But  
@robolfolm, R3Ptar_mindstorms v1.0 and R3ptar_mindstormsv1.01 seems to be totally different, settings there is no grid control on steps or tp.

My point was that I'd chosen a particular strategy (namely to close all grids that end up needing to open 5 trades or more - less than 2% of grids) and RV3.46 didn't work as I expected. The reason for my strategy (rather than just leave the trades to run) is because I've used grid traders and martingales quite a few times before, and have blown accounts,...

I have made a small amendment to 3.4, which is to move the EquityStop processing to the top of the OnTick event, before any of the filter checks. The reason for this is that the filters are to stop the EA from opening any new orders, and if any of the filters are triggered, the EA was not getting to the equity checks.  
  
This way, it will check the equity regardless of the filters in play, and exit on or near the requested equity stop.

Thank you for your prompt feedback. I will try to tweet on the trailing stop settings as the current default settings has contributed some losses even when EA traded according to MA trend.  
Hope you can continue to serve your noble cause.  
  
Cheers

these settings are same as what mavilakandy has tried out on the demo.  
  
Version is R3PTAR_Mindstormsv1  
  
It was slow on strategy tester, I didnt wait for full 1 year. Ofcourse though the quality is good, I didnt consider commission & Variable spread.

Thanks Rodolfolm, may we request that the FFcal news filter should also be fixed on version V2.25 and/or RV3.46 because the news event is 9 hrs in advance from broker time of GMT+2( The EA sense that there's a news so it wont trade but in reality the news event will happen 9 hours after). Hope that that this will not be a big burden on your part. Thanks in advance.

R3PTAR_Mindstormsv1 has definitely aggressive settings with a grid of 2.0. Account size will probably need to be more substantial to survive this. We shall see. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

I'm sorry that the picture doesn't come up. I'm going to talk about it.I hung up two platforms.The time of [EXNESS](/brokers/exness "View Exness Broker Profile") is synchronous and the IC MARKET time is out of sync.I'm still on the test.

The two test accounts in IC MARKET have different time.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f605.png?v=15.1)  
EXNESS time is synchronous. Two IC MARKET share the same computer, the time is different.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f631.png?v=15.1)

@rodolfolm Nice job on R3PTAR_Mind_Storm_V1.01  
  
Here is a perfect example that number doesn't really tell the whole story.  
  
This one is my risky setting from 2.21, the number looks really good, but it just doesn't tell the whole story, just because it has a good day doesn't tell the risk.

This one is from R3PTAR, just by keeping track of how it runs over the day, I can tell that this strategy on default setting is a lot less risky than the one above

Hello ....  
See attached three back test results of xBest_RV3.47. All are having big draw-downs.  
Those are good in analyzing the reports - please go through the reports to find reason for big draw-down, so that the EA could be modified by Rodolfolm.  
  
"Open one order by candle = false" - is it one of the reason ? Please check.

The relevant news does not open new orders. If the order arrives at the stop, whether it is TP, or wait for the news to end, to reach the stop line TP again?

Just a personal tip. When your margin falls below 1500% it enters the potential list in your brokerage firms to crush. so keep margin always above 1500%

Yes, 'last save first' was true in the back test.

Rodolfolm, do you have this changes incorporated in the latest version posted by you few minutes back ?  
I do not see any difference in parameters settings or in the back test result. See attached back test result for GBPJPY.

Some of members are asking for this R3PTAR_mindstorms.v1  
  
Guys it is in old posts by Rodolfolm. please look for files for all old versions. Anyway attaching it again.  
  
Though grid multiplier is aggressive at 2, drawdown wasnt so scary, as entry conditions seem to be good.  
But i would like us to test it a bit more with checking on few of those entries, we can try and filter to check few negatives.  
  
@rodolfolm are you using some of those new indicators, you were developing in this R3PTAR v1.

Hello...  
See attached result of live test, from the beginning till now, on R3PTAR.  
Yesterday there were only a small gain of $0.51 on closed trades. (a couple of hours the trading platform was in daily chart by mistake. Was it the reason?)  
It has floating P/L $25. But, why these open positions are not closing ? Maybe, rodolfolm can answer that question.  
Good news is that it did not make any damage when EURUSD moved up 115 pips.

The demo I post was on M5, it perform pretty well, but I haven't test it for long, so, try it at your own risk.

Few months BT on USDJPY with below setting:  
  
_Trial Stop off_  
Step pips = 6  
TP = 6  
Exp = 3  
Trial Stop = Off  
  
MA = 100, exponential, closed  
Hilo = 50, exponential, closed, invert filter On  
  
Average Profit % = 13 - 15% with DD ~10%  
  
_Trial Stop On_  
Step pips = 6  
TP = 60  
Exp = 2  
Trial Stop = On, Start = 6, Size = 1  
  
MA = 100, exponential, closed  
Hilo = 50, exponential, closed, invert filter On  
  
Profitability very good but with big DD. Personally, I don't like this set.

But that is always easier said than done...IMHO!  
  
How to react in this case...hedging, closing, pumping additional cash into account? I've often experienced that markets just at that moment turn their directions when you just have lost the control over your emotions...meaning being unable to also suffer a margin drop below 1500%!  
  
Nevertheless...happy trading, jdva 

I never lose - either I win or I learn...

@kaczucha11's test is not accurate at all, it's only 25% of ticks, I don't like your 86%, but it does more of a representation than kaczucha11's  
  
if I am not correct, than please correct me

Sorry...a BT on **M1** with just 25% modeling data qualitiy is completely useless...even just for checking EA's functionality... and moreover confusing...please do forward tests!

Recently, Europe and the United States have been very volatile, other currencies are diverging, difficult to test the effect, I am testing the X2.2 trend is good, concussion market is very uncomfortable.But in the volatile market, TRIO_DANCER, and RECHANGED are slightly better.

H4 trend, 15 minutes a candle, 240/15=16.  
58x15=870, is that a trend greater than 12H?  
At the top of the bottom trend reversal, multi - air power struggle, concussion of discomfort.Schrodinger's cat, don't look at it.  
I'm going to continue with different cycles, different parameters, tests.Adjust a good working state.

Rodolfolm, you are correct. It is making good profit in 5M time frame.  
But profit is reduced very much in 15M chart and it is making a loss in 1H chart.  
See attached screenshots.

that is what am doing. it is still running.  
  
I think, we need to filter to avoid those particular incidents. not many as such. that initial trade start we address with a filter it would do good. I will try and find a pattern.

I only start the R3PTAR for two days and face the 1.x percentage drop in GBPUSD, it in turn affect the EURUSD. I still think its a good EA, I think you are heading toward the right direction. I will still going to trying it on demo to see how it does until the end of the week.

Have a look at this. I tweak it somehow. backtest it and compare the result with the original one

give a slightly different version number like 3.474 or something like that.  
  
@rodolfolm on that 3.472 I noticed, that it is not closing some positions when grid is on. It opened 0.02 lot size while initial lot is 0.01, that one mismatch has killed the account, as it was managing more than 1 with same magic number.  
  
sol4live, your correction seems to have addressed that point. IT seems to be running in right direction. It has gone past that issue.

Much better now. Seems to be closing all trades and the equity TP is also working. It still has the bug which makes it start to open suddenly multiple same lotsize trades on every bar as you can see from the image.

Is there a way to get Mach2 MindStorm to keep trading after an equity stop has happened. When the equity stop hits and closes the losing trades it just plan stops trading. i have to close the mt4 platform and open it again to get it to trade again. And is there a way to hide the tp on R3PTAR. i feel if on a live account, it will pose a problem 

Happy Hunting!!!

After doing some more backtesting I came to the conclusion that the Take EquityStop is not working properly. Some trades are being closed prematurely as you can see from the image. I have set the TP to 50000 pips so that cannot be the cause for trades being closed.  
Hopefully no one is using this on a live account because the bugs can wipe out your trading account very fast.

Hello sol4live,  
After your changes, the EA improved a lot for EURUSD and USDCHF.  
But other pairs like USDJPY, GBPUSD, EURJPY, GBPJPY has lot of draw downs.  
It would be very good if this issue is addressed.  
  
The lot size is increasing very much.  
It is okay if this increase happens after few days of profitable trades.  
But if it happens in the beginning, the account will not survive.

Hi sol4live,  
  
Thank you so much for supporting with rodolfolm on the coding issue. Can you clarify which EA version you have taken to adjust the coding as my initial testing shown opposite trading direction and I begin to concern about that post from rodolfolm at #Post 1,092. If that was indeed the earlier version can you help rectify that issue as well because I have no experience on coding at all?  
  
Thanking in advance for your help.

House, please note that I am not a coder. I am only fortunate to achieve that because I like tweaking. Rodolfolm can testify to it because he is the one who has helped me with coding since he came to this platform.  
  
Thank you.

If you ask about opinion  
  
Based on the Morning Star which formed yesterday morning, it would be a downhill.  
  
But holidays hitting now, it could be relaxation of BULLs for a little while.  
  
Regarding your trade - good TP setting.  
  
But SL is too close.

Good work.  
  
With the right settings and the right risk appetite, you may actually double your account in 3 months.

Hello, because my news time is out of sync, I choose to close the news.If I choose to close the job before the red data is released, when the red news is over, I will open it again. Can the hedging function recompute the size and increment of the open position?Thank you for your help.

It is the HedgeLevel setting causing trades being constantly opened on each bar. I had set it to 12 and increasing the value to a much higher number got rid of that issue. One issue with the Hedging function is that it sometimes opens the hedges as 0.01 lots and sometimes as the Max Lot.

I did not forward test it. So, I might not known what you encounter. But I advise that you forward test to see if it resolved it.

rodolfolm,  
  
Would you be willing to do a modification of the R3PTAR to get it to trade counter trend. I am very happy with the forward progress of it with the settings that i have changed. was just interested to see how it did trading opposite the trend. maybe just put a line in the code to make it a option. Many props for the progress of these EAs. when the time comes in the near future i would like to use R3PTAR on a live account. If anyone would like to know what settings i have, let me know willing to share them. Right now its trading 90% win ratio on long trades and 81% on shorts. I have already said this but, it would be better if the tp was hidden. 

Happy Hunting!!!

I would like to know the setting you are using for r3ptar. Like what is your starting balance?? And is the reason why you want to hide TP is it from the broker?? I hear that brokers dont like it when EA are winning.

Me too have the same problem yesterday. My account got blown.  
Hopefully, a small modification will help to improve the EA: R3PTAR. Only Rodolfolm can do something here.

Here are my settings for R3PTAR. started with 50k balance only because the leverage for FXChoice is 200:1. These setting have been fantastic so far. I have it on GBPJPY pair.

I can't do that either. I have to synchronize my computer time with New York time.At present, I solve the FFCAL no synchronization problem.It's not a good idea, but it can only be so far.

Are you only using one pair??? With 50k i think any EA will do good it has enough money to survive a huge surge. I'm also using FXchoice. I think I'm going to try running 3 pairs with 3k and see what happens. I love and hate GBPJPY and i see what they call it the dragon.

Not sure If I get you right. If time before/after news showing on chart not sync to your VPS timezone, maybe you try add argument when calling FFCAL  
If your timezone is GMT+8, then try to put 2.

Hello Rodolfolm,  
  
Please see the screenshot of XAUUSD, 1H.  
I have no idea about the indicator you are using for R3PTAR. It was making SELL trades when the price was going up and down.  
  
On 27-March, price was going up.  
On 28-March, price started to go down.  
  
Both days, R3PTAR was making only SELL trades.  
  
On 27-March, the EA is made BIG loss.  
On 28-March, the EA is made BIG profit.  
  
Just for a try, could you please replace/change the indicator to **50 period MA exponential** in R3PTAR.   
The EA should BUY when the price is above 50-period-exponential and SELL when the price is below.  
  
Hope you will find time to do the above.  
Thanks,

Hello people,  
if someone is interested, I have made a MT5 version of basically xBest (initial).  
However this one will trade both ways simultaneously.  
Basically it will buy when bid is above 3 ema and sell if bid is below. And repeat buying (and/or selling) on the next bar open if position(s) challenged.  
Operating hours (as local time, look for entry) can be changed in the code and are currently set to 1 (1 am) - 19 (7 pm) for I am in the CET time zone.  
I have tested it in a JFD broker's MT5 demo terminal. It works there (i.e. E/U).  
**Disclaimer: For demo purposes only. Otherwise at the sole risk of the user.**

As I have stated, it is basically the same as xBest. And higher versions of xBest can run both ways simultaneously (two engines), so use that.

Ok I forgot to make a button to stop the mad one from opening new trades (but will manage existing), and also to retrieve positions in case of deinit/init.  
So here the version with button. And yesterday's performance with history quality = 100%.

Thank you.  
  
Max lots, Max number of trades to each direction and a hedging function should make the ea much safer. The hedging could for example start after xx trades and have it's own multiplier. Hedging could also be indicator based. In the image you can see a trend reversal which kills the ea. IMHO it doesn't make any sense to continue opening unlimited mg trades against the trend.

You are right, it does not make sense. These types of algos are suitable only for ranging markets. If such a thingy gets caught in a trend, one can only pray that the trend will not last long enough to kill the account. Another possibility is to put it to work on higher time frames, as the algo will open new positions only at next bar open. And/or have wider distance between positions. Re: trend: If it were easy to spot a trend, and to know its duration etc., trading would be easy, even a kid could do. Because if a trader or algo starts to hedge at some point and soon thereafter the trend disappears, then nothing is gained.  
Basically this guy has it summed up about how to handle the situation: [https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...72#post9018872](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=9018872#post9018872)  
Now, I do not intend to develop the algo to no end, it is just a translation in style of the basic concept discussed in here, to another platform.

I would rather have an ea handle the same trending situation like this:

Hello...  
This is regarding R3PTAR, the EA is not behaving as per the set parameters. See attached screenshots.  
The parameter was set for BUY trade only. But the EA is making both BUY and SELL trades.  
Another example, the parameter was set for OPEN ONE ORDER BY CANDLE = TRUE. But it open several traders per candle.  
  
Without knowing exact behavior of each parameters we cannot make any winning set up.  
I sincerely wish, these things will be addressed by our expert coders. Otherwise we will not make any improvement.  
Please help................

The R3PTAR engine is the sell side and the xbest would be acting as the hedge engine. it will be entering the buy trades when the pair that it is attached to starts to sell off

Daily Target in Money on the R3XFX engine would be quite useful and/or equity profit target for the whole ea as well. The ea seems to have high potential.

In FFCall, the sixth extern "OffsetHours". The default is 0 but you can assign the value from EA to it.  
You go to EA (.mq4 file) and look at the statement that call FFCAL then add one more argument (at sixth position) with value (ex. 1, 2, 3) which will be passed to FFCall. I use the value "1" and get the correct time. if your timezone is GMT+8, then try with 2. if still not correct, try other number.  
  
Original Code  
int impactOfPrevEvent= (int)iCustom(NULL,0,"FFCal",true,true,false,true,true,2,0);  
  
Add new argument   
int impactOfPrevEvent= (int)iCustom(NULL,0,"FFCal",true,true,false,true,true, **1** , 2,0);  
  
Hope this would help to resolve your issue.

@WGChina, if your broker is ICmarket ( GMT + 3 now ) use my attachment file, and you will get correct time and dont need change anything from xbest or VPS time. and if your broker is GMT +1 so you need change OffsetHours to 1, if GMT + 9 is OffsetHours to 9. . Easy !

I have asked Rodolfo not to release new versions of same EA each 4 or 5 days , maybe some news end of this week.  
  
I am starting recently to build up settings for RV3.4 ....2 or 3 pairs no more for my style.  
  
V.Storm , all settings I have tried all the weekend ( optimization) have blow the 3.000$ demo account ..already tested 4 pairs on 1 year time span.Still have 24 to test.  
( takes more than 18 hours each, with tick data , on my i7 12gb ram laptop).  
  
News soon when I feel ready.

My demo ( as per Trade Explorer) is now in a ´little´ DD , since begining of experiment with Xbest V2.2 ,it stayed around less than 5% , now it has reached 15%. So  
what I did is :  
  
a) deactivated EA that is on GBPCHF and AUDJPY ( un-ticking allow live trading).  
b) Closed gbpchf and audjpy with a small tiny loss of 4 or 5 pips ...few cents loss.  
c) XTI which moved (down) 210 pips in few hours , seems now to have stabilized , which does NOT mean that it can´t go down further. XTI ea is trading on M30  
candle with allow 1 trade per candle to TRUE. I have changed this to 1 trade per each ONE hour (H1) candle.  
  
So, I have now more free margin for a sixth or seventh level ...let see how it goes later today or tomorrow.

Hello   
Please add xBest_V2.2 Trailing Stop  
  
I did some copy and paste and watched a few YouTube videos but the result was unsuccessful.

Stephan...I think you have managed the sharp drop in XTI Oil very well so far in your TE...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)! In any case it gives us hope for the entire system!  
  
I also have tried some other instruments like DAX, Gold, Silver on that EAs but without success, hence we should stay on currencies They do provide us with the best risk/reward possibilities...IMHO. Oil may be very volatil sometimes after the release of new API stock reports and CAD as well. However a 3% daily price change on currencies in comparison is very rarely.  
Sometimes it seems that the EA has to build up some pressure with the DDs in order to gain further profits afterwards...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)!  
  
Currently I'm testing RV3.44 on M15 on my basket with engines A+B (lotsize bug?) and filters disabled with good success...

Hey guys,  
  
I'm not sure if this would be helpful for anyone, but I give this same piece of advice to anyone who would listen.  
I come from a background of investments in equity, bonds and ETFs.   
I have only started dealing with forex algorithms about 2.5 years ago, with decent success.  
My view on investments has never changed throughout the years - I firmly believe in the power of a diversified portfolio.  
  
Currencies are no different from other forms of financial instruments - they can be diversified.   
I think this is especially important for martingale-based strategies like this one. For anyone who is genuinely interested in taking this live, I would highly recommend that you experiment this with a diversified set of currencies, preferably non-correlated.  
  
When shit hits the fan - the worst case scenario is that you bite the bullet and close the worst performing trades while letting the profits run for the better performing trades.  
  
Of course, every good strategy comes with a consideration of the worst case scenario - which is the black swan event all your currency pairs performing terribly at the exact same period. But think about it - what are the odds of 28 pairs (or 30, if you love gold and silver like I do), performing terribly all at one go? Highly unlikely.   
  
Give this a try guys, it worked for me, I'm sure it will work for you too. Happy to discuss this further for any interested parties.  
  
All the best guys!

To expand on carddard's post. There is real potential here if you hedge your grids. The EA becomes almost ATM'esque which I would say is the holy grail of forex trading. The difficult part is not the grid steps but finding out the perfect time to hedge and detecting breakouts in order to overcome negative grids.  
  
Holds true for Xbest and Mindstorms. You will also want a high leverage trading environment on multiple pairs.

Yes, agree. This is the reason I trade GBPCHF, AUDJPY and XTIUSD ( crude oil) only ..till I build equity to be able to add XAUUSD ....GC and AJ have relatively small ADR too.  
Anyway , nice tip. Thank you.

Not so bad for one week...RV3.4 on M15 forward test, one trade per candle, engines A+B and filters disabled, max DD 5,7%, max. margin used 1300€.  
But you need patience and perseverance...should be no problem with a well-funded account no matter whether demo or live, a precondition for martingale based EAs!

I have been spending quite a bit of time analyzing and testing the various versions of this.  
Most of the versions have immense potential. And I mean **immense** potential.  
My struggle is, like all grid-based EAs, a significant enough move has the ability to wipe out all of your gains.  
Test it long enough and you will know what I mean.  
I believe there are 2 ways to mitigate this - ways that I am sure would drastically improve capital protection.  
The 1st way is to trade this algorithm in a basket of currencies. The 2nd way is adding an additional method of closing your trades - which would reduce profitability but increase stability.  
I went about modifying the code and I will show you guys what I'm alluding to soon.. It's late here now. Imma crash.  
  
Later guys! Trade well!

> I have been spending quite a bit of time analyzing and testing the various versions of this. Most of the versions have immense potential. And I mean immense potential. My struggle is, like all grid-based EAs, a significant enough move has the ability to wipe out all of your gains. Test it long enough and you will know what I mean. I believe there are 2 ways to mitigate this - ways that I am sure would drastically improve capital protection. The 1st way is to trade this algorithm in a basket of currencies. The 2nd way is adding an additional method...

Yes, agreed with you carddard.  
These EAs are making good profit on a daily basis for several days, but all of a sudden if a big move happens, all profits that we have gained for last several days is wiped out. That is what we have to avoid, by doing a proper modification of the EA. Hoping that you will come up with a good solution.

@rodolfolm,  
  
That is a good one. To check the trend on a bigger timeframe for confirmation to enter and exit(cut losses).  
  
But lets keep the M30 to be congifurable - means you can change it in settings. That way, we can change it to H1, H4 or M30 itself.   
  
And MA period also to be flexible. - so we can try 200, 90, or other so that we can test... multiple periods to see which one works better.

Since many weeks, I am silently following this thread and anxiously waiting for final product from Mr. Rodolfolm. I have tried some versions shared in this thread on demo and in volatility, they resulted in loss.   
  
Sorry to go off the topic, anyone tried EA shared here? <https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=716049>  
  
I have backtested this ea with 2 years data and also did demo forward testing. I have tested first time an EA which can survive all kind of market conditions (ranging / choppy / Sideways). I have tested hundreds of martingale / grid EA's so far, none of them survived, especially the months of May and June 2017 on EURUSD because there was spikes of 150+ pips in these 2 months.  
  
This EA survived due to its unique signal feature and SL maybe.   
  
sorry again for going off the topic. Just shared here maybe this EA will give some idea to perfect little grid rider.

Problem is intentions of the developer are unknown. The EA has expiry date. So it is no point taking it on and you are left in middle.

I have asked the coder. He clearly mentioned that he will put final product for sale. He don't have hidden intentions like other coders.

Hi guys, the EA I'm developing will be 100% Free. I have no intention of selling. I do it for hobie only and I like to help people.  
My goal after completing this EA is to leave it on a real account and the money earned in the profit be converted into donations to institutions dealing with disabled children.

Hi Rodolfolm,  
  
You misunderstood my post. It was about another coder, not you. You have clearly mentioned your intentions in this thread many times. Cheers ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f642.png?v=15.1)

That's the bug I reported earlier. Insert the EA a second time on the chart and it should load without the error.  
  
It's a good EA and it would be nice to see it updated with the latest version of xBest engine including the Equity TP function.

Don't want to bust your hope but backtesting gives you False results on that EA you mentioned because that EA trades on PERFECT market conditions with no slippery, but in REAL Account trading, I and many others had lost big money using that EA. I was on VPS with 2 ms ECN at ICMarket. I tweaked various parameters based on many suggestions on that thread and the discussions at soehoe site. Quick counter-trend trading can make you lose a lot of money esp on EUR and GBP with breakout news.  
  
I traded that EA live for two weeks and lost money on many trades continously, I stopped using, stopped testing, and stopped watching that EA thread. That thread in your link was dead, the thread at Soehoe is DEAD too as all lost money on trading in live accounts, no new posts in weeks.  
  
If you backtest BREXIT night on GBPJPY or GBPUSD, $700 turns to $70 millions with that EA, of course it's wrong.

I am in EXCESS and IC, and at the same time VPS 2 clients, open and open positions are different.There is no way to see who is trading with.Over-the-counter trading, buying and selling prices, floor trading and economic trading.I'm still fuzzy.

Point of correction sir,  
I doubt if there is any EA that will survive on BREXIT on GBP because of spread volatility and related factors.

There are plenty of MA cross EAs available, where you can check and test.  
  
Those MA 21 and 62 crossings are not so great.

Here's any idea.. Apply this same grid-based strategy as a BAU..  
And when shit hits the fan, apply a zone recovery.  
Why hasn't anyone thought of that?  
  
It may not be the most elegant of solutions but it works and you can sleep in peace at night.  
Tell me someone has already done it!

when trend returns backup when you just applied zone recovery, thats the main problem.  
  
We have to come up with formula, when to apply. that has been the real challenge to come up.   
  
i was discussing about the same just now.

Please explain what BAU is.  
  
About recovery zone (or hedge) , well I think that most grid traders have already dreamed about that functionality that if efficient in 100% of the cases would turn ANY grid /marty in an holy grail. Imagine so much gain per month , almost risking nothing ...like you said if s...hit the fan ,well all trades are closed at breakeven ( or with insignificant loss).  
  
Coding this into any EA (or AI code) would be a goldmine for any programmer. Unfortunately , hedge´s masters are skilled & experienced manual traders but have poor coding skills. Vice-versa for coders (no offense to anyone here).

BAU = Business As Usual, meaning you use whichever grid strategy that does well in range times. In our case let's take xBest as an example.  
  
I plug a grid strategy into XAUUSD.  
During range times, I profit with my BAU strategy (grid) - note that BAU can be either grid or trend, depending on how you want to play this.  
When s*** hits the fan - you define what *** is - in my case, I set it as: when DD >= 5% of account balance  
  
As a proof on concept, look at this image i have attached. The black dots are periods where s*** has hit the fan.  
  
Of course, the success metrics of this strategy hinges largely on your lot size and also your definition of when s*** hits the fan.

Hi guys and coder,  
i follow this treath now for awhile and found the EA xBest RV3.47 very interesting and qiute impressive. Are you still working on it?  
In this case, i do also some test and change the signal (signal = -1 will open sell and signal = 1 will open buy) just to see what´s happen. The result i got was fine for me. I have some basic knowlegde about mt4 but not enough to programm a EA like this.  
Therefor i would like to assist with idea but coding will not be possible.  
regards  
Ehonk

This sounds to me like a partial hedge, that eats away your losses bit by bit. Logically speaking it can be done till you get least a breakeven position. I think it might be worth taking a look at.

@carddard: exactly it should cut the losses bit by bit. Would be great if you have a look at this proposal!  
Are you able to do the coding?

I think they crux of this is not so much about closing the closest, or furthest trades. The partial hedges could be done with any of the opposite trades logically speaking. I think the biggest question is if this strategy would survive an expanding range.

Is implied volatility ok?Cannot adjust the spacing dynamically, adjust the spacing manually.?

This is what I mean by.. would it survive an expanding range (See image - black dots represent expanding range with above average volatility).  
  
The question remains - if you let the original grid strategy run by itself, how long can it withstand an expanding range? And swap is another problem.

The price fluctuates up and down Beyond the average premium will return, but no premium, prices tend towards a direction to move forward, this time is our explosion, I can't find such a tool, but the options market implied volatility can push premium formula.But I can't find it.

The test account I feel is always profitable, the real account is hard to say.Their explanation is "network", "setting", "server", and so on.So 3--4 points, it's easy to steal.

Forward-testing is better than back-testing, and live-testing is better than forward-testing

Thanks for sharing this graph. I have no clue on the time span it represents, but for sure it is +/-20% return with a DD +/- 10% , so , a "boner" for grid traders as  
R:R is 1:2 . Trading 2 or 3 selected pairs or commodities ( or even Indexes) diversifying would sure be the way to go. Subscribed to you.

I think it was for about a month or less. But please don't be deceived - over a longer term I'm sure we could expect more ripples. My view on this is that gold is hell of a monster. So a strategy that doesn't survive gold is not much of a strategy for me. I agree with you on diversification. That will be my next focus once I have fully conceptualized this piece.

Question for all..  
When s*** hits the fan.. Do you think it is better to hedge and continue running the usual engines, until breakeven is hit, or hedge while shutting down the usual engines?

You can include multiple pairs like this EA?

I think no broker would love when we win from both sides, they are not there to get us rich. or Richy Rich ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
  
btw im testint R3ptar v1 is that the latest ver ?  
  
rodolfolm i found a forum where traders trade on one direction and that is buy order only and go for short take profit levels like 10 to 20 pips or mostly 15 pips. pair are mostly usdjpy Eurjpy .. what ea could be that.. and they are winning since last 2 years. !  
  
any guess

Hi Rodolfolm  
  
First thank you for the great work. I appreciate it very much. I think the best way to prevent big drawdowns is to take a Moving Average (for example 21/1H Chart corresponding 252 MA on 5M). If the price is above the MA then only buy with Take profit and martingale only on retracements until you reach the MA. If MA is reached and price goes under MA then stop the buy martingaling and sell only with TP (let the buy positions open) . If the price reverses over MA then martingale again the buys until TP. For sell vice versa.  
  
What do you think about?

It has been a crazy 2 days.  
I started with meddling around with 4 exit filters.  
  
It has evolved.. so much - and now I believe for this to be fulfilled to it's fullest potential, there could be up to 12-15 ways of managing risk and closing out your trades at a profit. I know I sound cryptic.. It's hard to explain to you my excitement on this discovery in words. Let me show you some graphical representation of what I'm talking about soon..

@[rodolfolm](https://www.forexfactory.com/rodolfolm)   
  
Your R3ptar is working perfect, Im live testing it on current market as and watching this Ea behavior, It never miss behave even I close my pc for whole night. Im running it on different major pairs, on min 15... It just make profit and the open positions are always lower then the profit it books. Hope to get some good at the month end.   
  
This EA is perfect even not using on VPS.

Not everyone will agree with this, but it has worked for me and it is one of the ways I use to make money in this challenging world of forex.  
  
Through my tests, I have discovered that there are 2 ways to craft your exits:  
  
1) Managing your current open positions and future positions with existing risk parameters (This would vary according to your entry strategy)  
  
2) Netting/offsetting/hedging your current open positions and future positions  
  
Nobody knows for sure, but I believe in my tests and my proofs of concept that without either exit strategy, a low risk, high profit strategy is near to impossible.  
  
I can pull off a low risk, low return strategy while utilizing #1 on its own, or #2 on its own. But who's here for a low return strategy? Not me.

my final words on testing different EA codded by [rodolfolm ](https://www.forexfactory.com/rodolfolm)  
  
xBest_RV3.472.exe is working best on min5 time frame. ( Default )  
then R3ptar.   
  
waiting for the final releases by rodolfolm, If his EA make profit as it is (with minimum DD) then we surly must donate 10% atleast from the earning we use to earn from his work.

Hello Rodolfo,  
Please see attached screenshot and kindly consider this point in your MACH3.  
This is to bring your attention for the need of two different groups of trades at a time if the price moves fast above and below of 100ema.  
Trade trigger parameter could also be a different strategy.  
Thanks,

So i have been making bunch of tests, figuring how to hedge the risk of long trending trades, which we never know until too late,  
We could never know how far the trend goes and how long , so we need a plan to exit our trade,  
1\. The grid close when the market reversal  
2\. If the market didnt reverse enough to close , we may continue trending, in some cases, Bust account.  
  
i read a Pdf in this tread about a way to hedge the 5 initial trades, with 3x the lot sum. BUT it doesn't tell you what to do when trend continues, where to exit.  
  
MANUAL Hedge Plan :  
lets say we set a hedge at step 7 of grid (which can be any step according your own preference)  
Outcome A- The grid reverses and closes itself up. leaving Hedge open. We need to average and close the hedge out.  
  
Outcome B - The grid continues to trend , opening up more positions with increased lot. We close the Hedge when the profit is enough to close the first 5 Trades of grid. Reducing Exposure, Rinse and Repeat if needed.  
  
[@rodolfolm](https://www.forexfactory.com/rodolfolm), can this auto rescue function be coded in your EA xbest 2.25? at least a new column to key in lot to hedge as a start and option to Allow continue to Grid after hedged   
This allow more flexibility and control on risk. thank you again for your awesome work here ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

I'm implementing. it is whatever be a grid solution  
and easier than all the hedge plans proposed here to contain the drawndown  
  
Link the Grid orders to the parent order they are trying to retrieve by order comment.  
Set a minimum profit for when the grid is greater than 2 levels.  
When the sum of the grid profit linked to the parent order (minimum profit orders) is greater than the Drawdown of open orders closes all open orders (Grid in profit )  
The Rex that I published here works in a similar way but it works with pending orders and fixed grid with martingale that if a hit saves the whole grid and closes all open. With minimal profit in dynamic grid this would save all open orders and significantly decrease the DrawDown in moments of strong tendency

It seems to be complicated for understanding ppl like us who dont know much about that calculation, just a small input please make sure that if EA get disconnected for any reason then the EA must not behave like a mad one it must understand the was from where id get dc and just behave what it should be, and must continue the disconnected functions without any problems.

This account is a demo run of first the R3PTAR then switched to MACH 1.3. absolutely love MACH 1.3. i have been controlling the draw down with some manual intervention. Currently running 9 pairs on that demo account. Will be looking forward to some draw down improvements in the coming updates.

Hi rodolfolm,  
  
R3PTAR_MINDSTORM V1 EA is closing even with negative profit, noticed this when there's a strong move, any solution or recommendation is very much appreciated. Thanks.

There seems to be a major bug in the lot sizing as they suddenly jump from 0.19 to 2.66. Using Equity lots but this happens with all lot configurations. It might be so that one of the engines has the lot sizes incorrectly configured in the code. EA is not respecting the max lot setting either. Using version MACH3v1.3

No, I am not able to do back test. The EA is not opening, or not able to drag to MT4 chart.

EURUSD from 010917-to date. Crash is caused by many sell trades left hanging open for a long time. This is why we need basket TP and equity TP in order to close all orders when the markets start to trend. The earliest trades left open were from 110717 and the ea crashed 011518.

Copy it into the presets folder for live or the tester folder for backtests (or both).

Thanks Maahome.  
Back test is working now.  
For a forward test or live trading, I have to drag the EA to the chart and then usually set up window will popup.  
But here, when I drag the EA to the chart the set up window is not popping up or nothing is happening.  
Please suggest if there is any alternative ways.  
Thanks,

Very nice results on M5.   
  
Pretty much all EU/UJ with set 3.  
  
not just good, **Too Good**. Initial drawdown- absolute dd is low. And we can live with 20-30 drawdown, as 2 engines are working together.

Is there a way to increase the start lot? It seems to be always 0.01. I would like to test with a higher initial lot and lower martingale multiplier.  
  
It would be important to be able to cap the max lot size. Now you can see the ea opening big lots and if you start from 0.01 and use for example 2.47, it is too risky.

Use M5 and test it. H1 & H4 crash.

The platform is floating point difference, or fixed point difference.Sometimes when I look at TP, the point difference expands, and sometimes I can't get TP,  
Will the fixed point difference be better?

You had an OnStart-function at the start of the code, which is used for scripts, not EAs. Perhaps an artifact left behind..

This EA loads on chart, but did not work on BT with this settings...EA on post#1353 did not load, but gives very good results on BT with MACHset...very strange! 

I never lose - either I win or I learn...

One issue with the EA is the huge number of 0.01 trades which are being closed at 0.10 profit. In real trading these close very often in a small loss, even on a demo account. I have been trying to find a setting which would allow to increase the TP for those trades but have not found it. Anyone?

Rodolfo,  
Both EAs are loading to the chart now. I have put them in 3 pairs each for forward test. Let us see the result.  
By the way, do I have to put different magic numbers for the same EA to different charts ? Please let me know.  
Thanks

You dont need to put different Magic numbers for different Symbols.  
  
EA will identify the Symbol (EU/UJ/GU/...)   
  
Magic number differentiates, if you are using 2 EAs on same Symbol. One EU chart MACH & Other EU another EA.

I believe that it has managed to stabilize the DD of the grid technique. The sum of all the profit obtained by the last profit min profit is greater than the sum of the Drawdown of the open orders closing the whole Grid and stabilizing the EA.  
I will send the EA to all those who contributed.

Please check the 1 pip TP because it is too small in real trading. You need to take at least 2-3 pips but 5 would be better.

That is right. The forward test report is not showing big draw down.  
After running the EA for few days, and also after doing some optimization process, the result can be improved.  
Rodolfo, appreciate if you can do something to reflect actual EA name and engine number in the 'Comment' column, so that each trades can be reconciled.  
Now all of them are showing only MACH for both MKM_MindStorms and MACH_Mindstorms.  
Thanks,

Hi everyone,  
  
I'm shock suddenly to see so much progress in this thread for the past couple days where I thought it has been stagnant for awhile. While I was patiently waited for updates in this thread I was running forward test on the EA xbest 3.47 for 3 weeks by now and it has produce me with great result.  
  
Please note that the valley in this graph was not contributed by this EA but it was cause by another EA tested in between. That EA was a total bummer hence I have removed it after couple days and fortunately the 3.47v had managed to recover the losses. If it wasnt the losses from the other EA, it would have generated even higher profit margin.  
  
However my BT result on 3.47v with the same settings does not provide as good result as FT, infact it was quite the opposite hence which is why I been foward test for so long. I actually plan to FT for a month before posting it but since you guys are seem heading for different direction so I have to post it now.  
  
And now I have to catch up with this new EA from rodolfolm (MKM_MindStorms and MACH_Mindstorms) which looks quite complex for me as a novice on EAs. Hope you guys can give me some pointers should I encounter any roadblocks which I pretty sure I will on this new promising EA?   
And hopefully my FT result will give you all some constructive ideas about the 3.47v

Good work rodolfolm. I forward tested it just for kicks for a week over a basket of uncorrelated pairs. My thoughts are that you need to increase your TP levels after anything more than 3 trades, and I'll never run this on it's own. Always in a basket. Diversification will help to reduce drawdown even further for this. Looking forward to updated versions!

I find the 1 pip take profit level also to be quite problematic. As you can see a huge number of trades are being closed at $0.10 or so and in live trading 1 pip TP is not feasible. Totally agree about the basket as this would also get rid of the 1 pip TP issue. The EA also still have a lot of bugs which you can see when you start to change the settings. Some good progress has been made though.

1 pip take profit? My settings are via traillingstop. I could not find this error. try to test for peppertone. brokers have rules that make it difficult to profit  
  
Do you say add some take profit pips for each open order?

When I change the trailing stop values, it does not change the TP. I get many trades closed at around 1 pip. Maybe trailing stop is not working on all 3 engines.

That looks like it is being set by the HARD TP setting, not the trail setting - check that the hard TP is set to greater than 10.0.

This was the set you gave a bit earlier. Not bad, it improved on default settings.  
MKM1.set file  
Spread- variable  
Slippage considered  
Tick Data Suite - Full edition.  
0 mismatch errors.  
  
\- I have noticed. Order Modify errors.  
  
MACH.jdva.set - didnt not survive long - from August to October 2018 - not good.

Haven't changed them from your set files. Only modified the trailing stop to show that the values make no change.

I did not load anything. Just paste the setfile. You don't have to load it.

So I finally figure out how to BT on one of this EA.  
Check this out, using MKV2 set2 on MKM Mindstorm1. The result is freaking amazing.  
I sure hope the same can be produce on FT later.  
Meantime I still not giving up on 3.47v.  
Will continue BT on with the rest of the sets.  
Thanks to rodolfolm.

Hi All,  
  
Can someone recommend which EA to work with please. There seems to be many different versions. Are they the same logic with different additions? Any clues on where to start would be appreciated.  
  
Thank you

gratz rodolfolm i think you created something close to the EA you wanted.  
  
EURGBP for Year 2004 with MKM  
Data obtained with Tickstory lite  
set file from rodolfolm "MKV6 small.set"  
  
Pretty resilient EA which clawed back it way from close to 60% DD and still finished with a 50% increase ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Hi,  
Pls see attached forward test result for around 38 hours, MKM_MindStorms $ MACH_MindStorms together, for EU, GU and UJ, 5M charts, default settings.  
It looks safe, though it is small in numbers.

Sorry I do not know what you are asking. Your original question was about a preset file? What do you mean when you drag the EA to the chart window - what window?

yes, unfortunately, it is really impossible to understand  
i have only ideas about rsi  
if you'll activate RSi just using it  
similar to other process like xbest  
very difficult to understand other settings.  
  
\---------------------  
moving avarage 200  
rsi 14- 15- 85  
if the price is below 200 days moving average only short pozitions with using rsi  
  
price below 200 ma  
RSI closes under 85  
short position  
and use take profits following the first pozitions   
if the price goes up  
Use martingale or sum calculation  
same as xbest v2.2

Hi Rodolfolm,  
  
Apologies for the delay respond, been busy lately. Have tested the v26042018.set you given but the result isn't as good as i hope. But then i realized you have also attached the EA mindstorm together which I reinstall to mt4 on . It provides a slight improvement as you can see on v26042018.set_Mindstorms_new.  
  
Meantime, I have also tested on jvda set as well which gives a tremendous profit margin but also with higher DD risk  
  
Rodolfolm, can i ask you to rename the EA version if you have made any EA modification so as to prevent any confusion going forward? Cheers for your great contribution.

the first order that originated the grid to recover is the parent of all.  
Profit obtained by breakevem, profit of minimum profit and orders closed in the profit manually count to close all orders of the grid when the profit of the orders closed in the historico is greater than the current drawdown.

Unfortunately, result is not so encouraging...but I must admit that the data quality was not reported/available, thus it may not be very reliable...please take it with caution and just as a functionality test...we have to do more tests maybe with other settungs as well

It's a lot of money that mt4 does not even know how to calculate. Must exceed the precision of the double variable

this EA has HFT (High Frequency) algorithm. For it to work as in the backtest would have to have a super fast connection with the broker and an instant execution with normal [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") in a period of high volatility. Maybe it will work for brokerages. but it does not cost to test on a demo account. if you can make a profit post here myfx to collaborate.

Taking the leap for the team. I have adjusted the MM setting, the max open trades and the trailing stop. I don't have a lot of faith in back test so i will be the test dummy here. I will use a 1% risk on 4 pairs with 8 trades max a pair. 5.0 trail stop. Lets see this baby run. 

Happy Hunting!!!

Hi Rodolfolm,  
Have loaded it into chart for demo testing but EA does not trade. Used default settings except USeMM to false. Can this EA be demoed or for BT only?  
  
Thanks,

For it to work as in the backtest would have to have a super fast connection with the broker and an instant execution with normal [spreads](https://www.forexfactory.com/brokers.php#spreads) in a period of high volatility.

Yes only in higth Volatilidad definid in filter. usually a broker modifies the spread to not take the loss with these types of EA. This similar arbitragem

simple. volatiliade larger than filter and price breaking thread send order buystop or sellstop with breakout space. in times of volatility the bulls and bears fight and the price goes back and forth due to arbitrage as well. but few get low [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") in these operations that end up hogging the profit from the operation.

Hi Rodolfolm,  
  
Quite a while I didn't touch FX as some reason but still follow this thread.  
I would like to say it's very good work for this EA. It comes quite far from first version in this thread,  
  
As free day today, with default setting and spread of 10, it's quite insane looking at profit in BT. However, it seems to work with very low spread.  
When I tried with spread more than 10 with bigger capital, it always blow out the account. Not sure if there's to do with setting for spread issue.  
  
Wish you find holy grail some day soon.

It'll be interesting to see how this pans out if someone has the VPS space to run this on a forward test.  
  
Anyone?

do not rely on the backtest even with 99%. backtest does not simulate the actual market conditions just the basics. this EA is to show that we should not rely 100% on a backtest test.

There is no holy grail in the market. In the market the money goes from one person to another or for one to win one has to lose. If one person wins with the valuation another loses with the devaluation the money just circulates. Banks are the great players who have great strength in this game.  
  
  
see how banks manipulate the price by liquidating all purchases to make the market a sharp drop. as soon as they stop loss a good amount of orders they return with the price to their previous level

the market is a psychological war where those with little capital lose easily.

I think there's a potential on the way.  
  
At the same time do we have to change the magic number to run eu gu uj?  
  
I know this kind of Expert  
I reset the account once   
back tests always win but to be very different in the real account  
  
this is the ugly expert I mentioned

It also works with volatility filter that in the backtest is one thing and in real life is another completely different.

Each broker has its rules to make your life difficult. (They say it's to ensure their safety) Min SL / TK distance from the opening price, Max Orders Opens etc ... test in [pepperstone](/brokers/pepperstone "View Pepperstone Broker Profile") or other ecn

But fast connections are literally not possible usually.   
  
11sec is still not good. few of the trades which show profit in backtest will be loss makers.

It does not open any order on [XM](/brokers/xm "View XM Broker Profile")'s cent account while other EAs work fine.  
  
I have checked logs but there is no error msg...

ok brian thank a lot!  
my BT was with a modeling quality of 90%, now on a M1 BT with 25% quality my results are impressive to say the least, but irrevelant i guess with such a low quality.  
  
Is the low quality model bother you or like rodolfolm says we don t have to take in consideration the BT?

Open the new order window and see what your broker has for a minimum distance from market price and change the setting in the EA. See attachments.

perhaps in an account with commission on the spread the EA comes out better.

@rodofolm does this mean that I can adjust the size of the trailing   
  
BTW, the EA did really well with fed red day, it triples the demo account, if I can adjust the trailing, and put the EA in the VPS, I think it will do even better. If you want the trade record to see how it did, just PM me.

It looks like brokers that do not charge commission don't allow GoodJob to run on their platform

1 - If I change the set nothing changes everything remains as if there were defoult settings.  
  
2- After changes to the set the first pending orders place the SL above / below the current price.  
  
That is, if BuyStop the SL is placed above the current price  
if Sellstop the SL is placed below the current price.  
  
It is not a problem of wrong settings, also because nothing changes as I said before in condition 1, even if I change only one parameter, condition 2 occurs.  
  
Thank you

Hello,  
I am talking about running an EA in a **real cent account** and **forward test** in a live market. Same broker and same leverage.  
Do we get same result in both case?

I tested [EXNESS](/brokers/exness "View Exness Broker Profile").The results are different.Real account purchase prices are different from analog accounts.The simulated account order has been closed, and the real account has not been leveled off, leading to the increase of DD.

Hello,  
Thanks for your reply.  
If the practice account and real account prices are different, what is the point in doing back tests and forward tests ?  
That means, if an EA is proved working good in practice account, that may not be the case in real account. As such, aren't we simply wasting our time to do lot of tests here ?

You have to back test and test to make sure EA will make money and find out the weakness of the EA and the setting you use, so maybe you can have another EA to hedge and cover the weakness. So, this is a long process.

It does tells us to pay more attention to live testing than backtesting.

Hi Rodolfolm,  
  
Why am I not getting similar result like yours for EURUSD 1H using default settings? Was it due to the modelling quality or am I missing something? Kindly advise, thanks.

spread 24 . this EA works with [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") below 10.  
  
and does not work as in the backtest because in the backtest is not simulated the spread variation in times of volatility. in real account the brokerage house when you see your stoploss goes there and increases the spread just to get it.

@rodolfolm   
  
Ideas for goodjob2, instead of using volatility as an input for trade, you could try using range of H1, ex, BB band with custom range, if it break out that range, make the trade, then it might possible to get EURUSD trade from 4/19 to now. This is for range breakout.   
  
I was a lit bit busy, so I didn't have time to do custom setting for the EA, but use 4 different EA on VR Smart grid for FF, Goodjob mindstorm v1, MKM mind storm, and R3PTAR on DEMO, by just using default setting on M5, it has good result due to the volatility of the market, however, Good job on M5 is dangerous, it should only be use as design on H1, it only make money in certain trading conditions.

Martinyan, sorry to hear about that. Thought it will not help you, I can tell you that it is not only you.There are lot of bloodshed around.

Hello,  
  
It is interesting. GBPUSD is a hard pair sometimes. Could You share a demo account report as well?  
I am really sorry that this EA blow up your account. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1)  
  
What kind of settings are U use for? Is it possible to share? We will learn from it.

is still under development and testing. In addition, unreliable brokerage firms manipulate the price of the asset to keep their money. (Liquidators) They identify the strategy your EA is using and start working against it, so it's good to always choose a good broker. In the follow-up of the tests and backtest was done in pairs little volateis by EA present this risk in high volatility. In addition, you have put the EA to run in pairs all related to the USD (Your exposure was higth to USD which is very volatile)  
  
Always see that mt4 tab to check your exposure to risk. and always keep a margin above 1500. If you reach that margin do not open more orders and try to close the open ones. margins below this are easy targets for brokers.  
Remembering that forex trading is just a gamble. those who drive book prices and everything else are just the banks that usually partner with these fraudulent brokerages.

Was this your first post on this topic? had no doubt about EA and was already putting it into real account? did a 99% backtest with your broker's data before actual account?

Dear Traders,  
  
There is profit possibility, but no one is interested to fine-tune the strategy. I have been telling this for last several week.  
  
The strategy is simple. It is good for a trending market. In a ranging market we have to wait until the price started to move to close the trades.  
When the indicator (I use 5ema crosses 20ema in 15M and D charts) started to show downward/upward trend, buy and sell simultaneously.  
10 or 12 consecutive trades with 5 pips gap, and increase each trade's lot size. It will be showing one side profit and other side loss (loss is slightly more than profit). After 40 or 50 pips move in one direction, close all profitable trades and wait for the loss side to retrace the price. (same tactics of grid system).  
  
See attached statement to see the profitability on GBPUSD pair yesterday.  
This profit was made by using a semi-auto EA (made by me using EA-builder) and my manual involvement. See attached EA.  
  
There are two EAs to be attached in two different price chart, same ccy pair. Turn on the auto-trader when we see indication of a trend. EA does buy and sell simultaneously, 10 or 12 consecutive trades with a gap of 5 pips, increase each trade's lot size. No TP or SL is fixed at this level. Manual involvement is needed after this stage. When we see the price is moved 40 or 50 pips in one direction, manually close all profitable trades. Then calculate the average cost, with or without some profit, of loosing trades and fix this price as TP of loosing trades, and wait for the market to retrace.  
  
In majority of the cases, price will retrace after 50-60 pips move in one direction. _There is a risk if the price don't come back, say for another 100 pips._  
  
**I request your help to get the EA modified to avoid manual work, because it is not easy to calculate the cost and fix TP manually.**  
**TP should be fixed only after price moved 40-50 pips in one direction. So, automatic calculation of cost (for the loosing side) and fixing TP is needed in the attached EA.**  
  
I hope, I have explained within my capacity. Please ask if you need any clarifications required.  
Thanks for your patience and expecting your support.  
Regards,

I realised. The original code has potential but it needs to be refined with a few risk controls and hedging mechanisms.

Hello carddard,  
See attached two screenshots, from live trade today. One chart is for the price moving up and the other one is for the price moving down.  
Closing the trades are done manually in a hurry-burry situation when the price is moving fast. That process need to be automated.  
The initial lot size is 0.01, then increased to 0.02, 0.03, 0.04 etc.  
Pls let me know if you need any further clarification.

The EA was made by me using the site 'EA Builder'. Probably, it won't allow to share the EAs made by their software.

Thanks for the developers and supporters of XBest EA! I am using version 4.7 on live account and so far it's good. Been using for just a week on eurusd. Maybe I 'll add another pair if needed.

Standard broker history does not cover large timeframes for cross and exotic pairs like AUDCAD. Either choose a more recent date to start from or invest some time and money in tickdata.

You are just being lazy... I will advise that you take time out to read through the thread, grasp underlying principles behind each of those EAs. it is only then you will be able to apply any of them correctly.  
  
I am 100% sure that Stefdek cannot help you with comprehending the principles even if he offers to explain them briefly to you.  
  
Just my advise..... Sorry if it sounds horrible to your ears, eyes, and mind.

The accuracy of ATR is higher than that of MA. When the ATR and MA change, I can only switch to manual driving.

Hi Kpip , you are not clear about which(who´s) TE you are looking. But if you refer to mine, have a look at FIRST post of this thread. There is a link to a post I made  
with the EA version I am using + the settings for 3 pairs I initially used at the start of this TE. I quickly understood that WTI ( USOIL) was the "mad cow" in the ranch.  
since it produced a sudden 35% DD ...for barely adding 6-7% to the account each month. Bad R/R.  
  
I then stopped trading this "pair/commodity".  
  
Now that I reached >50% , small mod..I just added **+1pip** to the basket Take Profit. GBPCHF being now TP=7 and AUDJPY being TP=16. When I reach 10k , I will be back to TP 6/15 , but will increase starting lot size to 0,02 on **ONLY ONE** of those pairs ...till I reach 15k.  
  
My comfort zone is around 15% DD ...when this one getting greater than this ...I switch ONE TRADE PER CANDLE from 15 min to M30 or H1 ..even H4 or more if needed.

hi stefdek,  
  
thank you for your kind explaination on setting.  
can i ask what is the maximum drawdown on the TE ? i see return DD was 0% in TE tab, can i ask the maximum DD u experienced in this TE?  
and what capital you believe can start with your setting safely

Yes , DD was very low ....no more then 5% ...even with this latest largest 2.56 lot position ....they were 150 pips between 1st trade and the latest ..with a max level of 5 ( 5 levels) .... a small retracement of 25 pips was enough t close the whole basket .... . This is why I selected these specific pairs ....  
AUDJPY will make 70/80% of their ADR during Asian session ( asian pairs) ...and GBPCHF will do the same during London session ( mostly)...and unlikely to move like crazy both pairs (uncorrelated) at the same time.... . so , if you look at TE ..AUDJPY closed "gently" after NY Open ...

Did you asked XM online support about this ?? or are you just expecting an XM user to answer you while passing by ?  
  
If you trust XM as per real account. Then stay with them ..you can still run your EA on Tickmill demo ....and use a trade copier ( FREE) - look at the applets @ FXBLUE.  
  
You have an excellent one (i used it) that copy trades from one broker to another but your 2 MT4 instances have to be on the same VPS ( I.P.) , response to trade opening /closure is almost instant...

Thanks for reply , good idea ...i think [XM](/brokers/xm "View XM Broker Profile") not allowed this EA because banned the GRID EA , but is possible put inside the code something for a stealth mode ??

Hello rodolfolm, can you write a version of XBEST2.2 of MT5? I believe its work will become more flexible under the multi-choice high time frame!

Does anyone else know why I would be getting negative pips, but profit?  
Look at the 4th June.  
-97 pips, yet £103 in profit? Is this solely down to lot management?  
I know there's a heavy emphasis on 'pips is all that counts' mentality. However in reality, it's profit that counts surely?

It is a martingale so latest trade is highest lot size and to get out it uses dollar profit target not pips.

In my own martingale EA I use Ehler's Instantaneous Trendline on H4 as confirmation for buy / sell signals. I have run this both on demo and live with no crash for 1.5 years.  
  
Also I was thinking of using the Market Profile indicator calculation ("S-KG") for further confirmation, however I haven't tried it in backtest yet.  
  
Maybe you can use this in your EAs.

No, it doesn't close the open trade. I have tried that in backtest but it doesn't seem to give good results.  
  
I have an option to not add more trades if the trend changes and that seems to work for USDJPY and CHFJPY - meaning it gives smaller drawdown.  
  
For your information, the EA closes all trades when equity reaches 101% and also for each symbol when they reach +1% in profit. The cleaning up of all trades I think contributes to its survival.  
  
I normally backtest 2007-2012 and then run 2007-2018 to see if it survives with no crash as a way to select the right preset.  
  
Let me think about posting the ex4.

Probably cause the EA opened higher lot size and profit at lower pip count.

Hello Zoolander , your English is so bad that this is quite difficult to undertand the meaning of your post. If you want us to look at your TE (live) , ok I did . 100% in a month with a Martingale Lot multiplicator 1,38 ...on several pairs. If the EA is from one of our coder , please tell us which EA and share the settings to everyone here. If the EA is from other thread or from other origin ( other creator) ..Share EA with expiry date , so everyone can test few setfiles/pairs .....  
  
IF you just want to show us,how good is your ea AND how smart you are ......please knock at next door / thread ...

Hello there,  
  
are there any suggestions for the settings for xBest R3.48? On the timeframe of 15 min in my demo i started with  
  
EURUSD  
USDJPY (following stefdek with moving average Time 4h, Stepsize 10, TP 7)  
GBPUSD  
  
AUDUSD  
USDCAD  
EURGBP  
  
EURJPY  
GBPCHF (following stefdek with Takeproft 7)  
AUDJPY (following stefdek with Takeprofit 16)  
  
How to sort these pairs according to the "vulnerability" of my account?  
  
Perhaps starting with $200 only with EURUSD, following the hopefully risen equity from $400 with added added USDJPY and so on up to $1800 with all of the above pairs?  
  
We will see how it works with real money starting with risky $70 now, only with EURUSD  
[https://www.myfxbook.com/members/Pit...t-r348/2558073](https://www.myfxbook.com/members/PitDE/hf-500-5-xbest-r348/2558073)  
  
Here with the above (full) set of pairs as a demo  
[https://www.myfxbook.com/members/Pit...8-full/2560309](https://www.myfxbook.com/members/PitDE/hf-500-xbest-r348-full/2560309)  
  
Thanks in advance for any help!  
Later, Pit  
  
P.S.: arrrgh, catching a screenshot via CTRL+ALT+PULS seems not to work from my VPS.  
  
Most interesting for me it that DD in the realaccount with only EURUSD is max 20% and on the demo with "full" pairs is 30%.

So far so good, however there is a fair amount of lost pips with this EA. I need to try and focus on what variables will prevent such losses.

i tried all versions and found Xbest_V3 suits my nature, the only thing i feel may improve this EA is max lot feature addition, means when that level reached by EA then EA will not increase size of grid but fix the size of next lots opened....you have already placed this feature in other EA`s like mindstorm etc  
  
please add this feature in this EA, advance thanks to you

4 continous days of strong downtrend on BOTH pairs traded on my demo, have terminated with the DEMO account.This is unlikely to happen at the very same time in the year that JPY and CHF remains on top of the charts for so much time without a little retracement , while their "challengers" GBP and AUD remains for the same period of time at the bottom Strength charts AND most amazing that they did this AT THE SAME TIME.  
  
RIP AUDJPY - GBPCHF

I know its not my demo to post but i have to say i have been keeping a close eye on FX2 demo that he posted online [https://www.myfxbook.com/members/FXT...-rv347/2536983](https://www.myfxbook.com/members/FXTMS/xbest-rv347/2536983) and it has been performing well it has been having a very small drawdown and its only been making a small amount of money on these slow days but it has survived.   
  
I have been using my own demo with 3000 and trading four pairs but I think the drawdown has been killing my account. It still alive and even though I took some profit manually not to lose over marginalized my account.   
<https://www.myfxbook.com/portfolio/xbest-347/2567310>  
  
Im wondering if there is any way to change the take profit in 3.47 I feel like it takes a while for it to take the profit or maybe its just me???. Also wondering what pairs would be good to trade now since JPY and Euro went to shit. Thank you for all your work

I also use xbest 2.2 for about 3 weeks now on live account. Currently in some DD on USDCAD and AUDUSD and waiting for retracement about 50 pips to get in profit.   
I'm trading 8 pairs.

Hi,  
  
xbest 3.48 is working fantastic. Mostly it doubles the account in one day. On the third day difference of equity and balance becomes greater and greater. Suddenly the DD becomes too great - i have to cut the losstrades than with very bad results.  
  
If we could find a way to avoid this (perhaps: How great are the losses? Do they reach more than 10$ per trade? Why not using a money management proven stoploss for that?) this Hedging EA is one of the best i have ever seen.  
  
Even with the statistic of 2000 trades on an $5000 dem account here [https://www.myfxbook.com/members/Pit...8-full/2560309](https://www.myfxbook.com/members/PitDE/hf-500-xbest-r348-full/2560309) i couldn't find exactly the (to be avoided) point after that this scissor between equity and balance becomes to great (with margin call at his end).  
Don't laugh at me: If we could separate this "Scissor-Factor" a bit more xBest would be perfect in my opinion. Due to this "Scissor-Effect of Balance and Equity" the margin-eating pairs with GBP are terrible.  
  
Later, Pit

Need big account, small account life is limited.

Hi.  
  
I have some troubles with both 2.25 and 3.43.  
  
It seems that I cannot change the lotsize? No matter if I use procent or fixed lot, the lotsize stays the same. Always 1.0 lot, no matter what I put?

It's really a shame. Thank you for starting this thread and kickstarting the discussion. You have helped and inspired many traders.  
  
The demise of the account is expected, very much like other martingale/DCA/grid-based algorithms because of the nature of the system - i.e. linear profits with quadratic losses. This could be mitigated with large account sizes (to a certain extent) - but over a long enough period the expectancy of the account drops.  
  
Drawing some inspiration from anti-martingale systems - is there a way for achieve expected losses and exponential quadratic gains?  
  
Maybe this is the direction we should steer towards.

I know everyone in here says they are using the default setting for x.best 3.47 but ive noticed a problem with it that when it gets to 2.56 lots it closes the lot and it just loses money. To me its not worth it opening a lot that big just to lose money. Ive also noticed that its on the wrong side of the trade a lot of times.

MA mean line, my understanding, the trend has concussion to go up, concussion to go down.Up + down we can work with MA averages, shock need a fulcrum, upward departure from the fulcrum need to stop order or switch time, downward departure from the need to stop order or switch big time.It's like a zero axis value relationship with MACD.

My friend, if you could do a post-mortem analysis, what do you think could be improved?  
Is it the initial starting capital? The lot multiplier?

Xbeast, I had a strange problem with my account today. After 5 minutes of GBPJPY BUY order from 0.01 to 1.70, I suddenly took a short Sell of 6.8 positions  
My account died  
What's going on here? After a sudden 6.8 position,  
The previous BUY order TP becomes stop loss  
It also issued 6.8 empty orders  
  
I use 2.2. How can I correct this error or what happened? Please tell me to correct or give up?

In my humble opinion, I think the key is to choose the pairs where to use the EA.Low ATR pairs and that are normally in a range. as for example these:  
  
EURCHF, EURGBP, AUDNZD, GBPCHF ...

Rodolpho hi.My Question is about the last version of MACH2 Mindstorm EA.Can we change the the lot amount of the buy or sell orders by hand optionally.Or can we add option like that;Open the hedge order of the last openned inverse order after some lot amount;true(For example when openning 0.4 lot buy orders,ı want to add hedging order merely with the last openned order with some lot,and there would be tp and sl of those 2 orders merely.System will go on with its rules eitherly also.)  
Last lot amount of inverse order to open hedge order;  
Lot amount increment of hedging order;  
TP of last openned inverse order and the hedging order;  
SL of last openned inverse order and the hedging order;  
  
İ hope ı could tell what ı mean

Rodolfo, tested it on live demo for R3ptar and result is great. Low DD. Will monitor further. I'm currently running XBest 2.2 real acc on just EU and looking at about 20% return a month with 1k and 0. 01 lot.

quick question guys :  
  
i am testing xBest v3.48 but all trades are being closed after just 1 Pip . How do i increase that to 2 or 3 pips or ideally 4 pips. Anything less than 4 pips you won't be able to trade on regulated brokers in US and Canada.  
  
What settings do i have to update to set it so that any trade is closed after 4 pips and not 1 pip ?

I do believe fx2 said that he was running the stock settings.   
Ive been running xbest 3.47 with very similar results too and running three pairs. As of today I am running 4 pairs with a 5000 account.

IMO,  
  
Any Grid EA with Martingale or any method never works due to Drawdowns. The Grid strategy is mathematically flawed because it assumes a lot of risk by accumulating risk and hoping for the best . Its the management of risk that makes you money in trading. There have been a million types of GRID EAs but all of them suffers from same problem ( RISK or DRAWDOWNS ) which usually blows up your account .  
  
If DRAWDOWNS can be solved then you can actually trade the GRID profitably .

I think the only way to be profitable using a grid or martingale strategy is to find one that doubles account more often than it causes it to margin call and take prfits regularly. I'm toying with the idea of putting it on a $10k account with 4 pairs and close all equity protection at 20% drawdown. I'm my tests i have doubled a $1k account 4 times, with 2 margin calls so theoretically made $2k in 6 weeks. I'll test the $10k strategy and keep everyone posted

Yes correct every Grid Ea suffer of DD huge in some situation, but if the coder include in Ea a different mode for open trade and also fixed an equity cut loss in % then they are problems that can be solved... For example Xbest EA have only a setting of EMA for decide when open the trade and it's not enought obviously!...But if the EA open a position using key level for example level min. and max. or pivot and open position at breakout or pullback with a good criteria , therefore the entrance is more accurate , i am not a coder but i think the people programming EA can do something different for filtered better the GRID ...

@Mike,  
  
IMO  
In trading whether using an EA , Manual Strategy or whatever it might be . It does matter if the mathematics behind it is flawed, Doubling your risk and hoping that you are going to recover your losses is a flawed assumption. if you have an infinite account of Billions of Dollars then probably you might be able to work out a way to average your trades out with a small loss. But most of us have small to medium accounts i.e US$ 1000 to 500,000 . I have never seen a GRID for the past 10 years that does not blow up an account even with filtering to reduce Drawdowns.  
  
Also note mathematically , The GRID profits are always equal or less than the DRAWDOWN at any moment .

quick question guys : i am testing xBest v3.48 but all trades are being closed after just 1 Pip . How do i increase that to 2 or 3 pips or ideally 4 pips. Anything less than 4 pips you won't be able to trade on regulated brokers in US and Canada. What settings do i have to update to set it so that any trade is closed after 4 pips and not 1 pip ?  
  
i have tried changing the following but none of them is able to adjust the profitable pips per trade   
  
input int InpTakeProfit = 200; // Take Profit in Pips  
  
input double MinProfit = 100.0; // Minimal Profit Close /Protect Grid   
input int QtdTradesMinProfit = 10; // Qtd Trades to Minimal Profit Close/ Protect Grid  
  
Every trade is opened and closed within 1 pip no matter what i change . Is there a setting to adjust so that every trade will be opened and closed after 4 pips profit   
  
Any help? FYI -- i have gone through the entire Topic and there is no where listing or explaining how to adjust that .

Yes , this is the way to go. Look at Fx2 account shared at Myfxbook ....from 1k to 4 k in less than 60 days....  
  
4k ( 1+1+1+1)  
  
1k "in the trade arena"  
1k in the bank  
1k in the bank  
1k in the "safe" ready to drop back when account blows happen.  
  
with 3/4 blow per year we are ok ...  
  
Money management.

I do agree money management is the way to go. I do believe you might need a bigger account to survive the huge drawbacks. I’ve also noticed that grid ea always get in huge trouble and I believe it’s because they trade against the trend.

Sir, is not really true , or not for force...i don't want spam or advertise any product but in mql5 market have one famouse GRID ea survive for 13 years of backtest stricktly...with a small DD , because use a lot of filter before enter in a market also use a pattern recognition, and many algorithm for have a profit without take a big risk....is a grid set and forget...i mean it's possible but not so easy for create like that...

I am not talking any EA down but, isn't it simpler to learn to trade rather than teaching a computer to do it for you? To teach a computer to trade means the coder of EA knows how to trade (true?). Some people spend years working on the programs, to no sustained success, why no just trade yourself? " famouse GRID ea survive for 13 years of backtest stricktly " That's great but did it make money going forward?   
I am all for progress and success, making money, etc. But one has to ask after seeing some ppl joined FF 5-8 years ago and still searching for the magic formula.  
Unless this is a side hobby which it completely fine!

Each broker has rules for SL / TP that prevent certain values from returning error in the definition of these positions.

quick question guys : i am testing both xBest v3.47 and xBest v3.48 but all trades are being closed after just 1 Pip . How do i increase that to 4 pips profit per trade. Anything less than 4 pips you won't be able to trade on regulated brokers in US and Canada. What settings do i have to update to set it so that any trade is closed after 4 pips and not 1 pip ?  
  
i have tried changing the following but none of them is able to adjust the profitable pips per trade  
  
input int InpTakeProfit = 200; // Take Profit in Pips  
  
input double MinProfit = 100.0; // Minimal Profit Close /Protect Grid  
input int QtdTradesMinProfit = 10; // Qtd Trades to Minimal Profit Close/ Protect Grid  
  
Every trade is opened and closed within 1 pip no matter what i change . Is there a setting to adjust so that every trade will be opened and closed after 4 pips profit  
  
Any help? FYI -- i have gone through the entire Topic and there is no where listing or explaining how to adjust that  
  
DOES ANYONE ON THIS FORUM KNOW HOW TO CHANGE THAT ?

ok. I see that it is your 2nd request in very few time to SOLVE a problem , like I mentioned A BUG in an EA that nobody here except his creator rodolfom could solve.  
  
The way to go is to PM rodolfom , he will also be glad to share his mq4 ( so he did at github) and , as you seems to have programming skills , you could solve the problem yourself.  
  
Just asking you to STOP hammering here.

Hello bro  
It was very good profit but USDJPY ruined it so we should stick with EURGBP only

I think one option is to take losses, once surpassed level 9 of martingale (2.56 lots) it costs to assume the costs of operations, I think one option is to take about 300e of losses that in your account would come to be 10% of the account, in 3 days this loss has already been recovered.

"trade context busy" is typical of broker requote game ...definitely not an EA problem .... . I could see a lot of "busy" when I was playing with Instafx ...one of the worse

As all currencies are related to USD, a large movement in USD could end the account. I think a variety in currencies would be interesting. for example: usdjpy, audnzd, eurgbp, cadchf

Thanks a lot, it looks like you fix the sizing issue, I am testing it, its great so far, its better than 3.48 with 3 diff currency. Its making money on day one(pocket profit minus opening trade) on demo. I will put it to test for another week to see how it does.

I’m having the hardest time setting up my fx book and there tech support sucks. A couple things I’ve noticed about using 3.47 is that when it gets up there in the lots like up to 5.16 it just closes the at a lost which in my opinion is not worth it if it’s going to get up there to 5.16 is there any way to change that ? Thank you so much

16 to 18 from $1275 to $1607 with (-91) balance on book at the moment  
  
I start with 0.01 then slowly adjust it to 0.1 and change max lot to 2 after it make some money, I think the 0.1 is too aggressive, so I might adjust it back to 0.08

My setting still blew the account, but it's complete me, it was an experimental setting, where I use 6 times the 1000 to 0.01 lot ratio, I am trying to find the best ratio in terms of profit. I guess 1000 to 0.03 should be fine.

No, it's actually on EURUSD, but its still trader's fault. When I saw it can survive a 500 pips drop on EURUSD on ratio 1000:0.01, I slowly increase it to 5 times that, and in the process, I change the setting in the Asia trading time( my time), which does not have volume, so nothing is happening except the EA set a new but buy limit using the new 0.05 base lot times the cycle its in, (@rodolfolm this is nothing wrong with code on this part, I think) but the program haven't clear the current cycle its in. So, that new big sell stop order got take place after it dropped another 500 more pips. This is one of the reason that it blew.   
  
A second reason, is because i didn't change the corresponding max lot from 1 to 3.   
  
PS don't try too may pairs on demo, because its a demanding EA on trading server, I got a warning from IC because I try to test 6 pairs at the same time.

I'm also testing this EA v3.48 but having same problem. I also read ALL through the post but haven't seen any remedy yet... Have you figured it out yet? And do you mind sharing it? I'm a newbie here. I just stumbled on this thread 2 weeks ago and since then I just couldn't wait to finish to the last page and that day was today. Thank you to all the members that has put so much efforts in this amazing journey of making to be a great EA especially Rodolfolm, xJhamil, stefdek and everyone (too many to mentioned). Thank you

sorry for my missing I had some problems to solve and I could not continuo the project going.  
  
  
I'm implementing the filter below which I believe will help in demotion by running into multiple pairs.  
  
Currency Filter:  
Stop opening currency deals if there are already trades on this direction. Filter forbids opening trades on the same currency at the same time. If Currency Filter = 0 – filter Off. Currency Filter value mean delay to open orders after signal the appearance in seconds For example, you open on EURUSD to BUY, that means that you freeze deals opening on EUR to BUY, and on USD to SELL. So USDCAD to BUY will open, and GBPUSD to BUY will not (only SELL). But a new deal on EURUSD to BUY will open. (The delay is necessary to avoid the entrance at the same currencies when signal appeared in one tick for several pairs).  
  
other possible soluction:  
MaxDD Release Percent:  
Drawdown that, when reached, removes block forbidding to trade.

I have the mindstorm project to create an EA with several sensors and strategies to act intelligently against the obstacles of asset price movement  
  
for this I am initially creating several sensors and engines to add everything in one future and as the market takes action it adapts.

Hello everybody  
We all know grid is good for ranging and bad for trend.  
So, how do you protecting from blowing the accounts?  
Is there any security feature in the EA that after xxxDD will stop opening trades?  
Is there an entry condition to target just ranging markets?  
I'm using a grid system manually. When the grid level are more that 10 usually the DD is too high for me and I'm forced to accept the loss and move on.  
Thanks

The best way is to hedge orders one by one after some lot or some DD with their own partial tp and SL range .And perhaps it can also be considered to restrict the pip distance of new open orders,means EA dont open any extra order before pip distance between the last openned order,comes to some value.

Could you please expand your idea.  
Let say I open a sell at 0.01lot and call this order Sell0.  
Price goes against me by let say 20 pips.  
If now I hedge this Sell0 opening a Buy1 at 0.01lot I still suffering a floating DD and that DD soon or layer will be a loss.  
I understood correctly your idea?

When orders are openned with for example 0.04 lot EA will open %80 hedge of that order.This hedge order will have its own partial TP and SL.İt wont open hedge orders till 0.04 lot seen(when on step lot option).So we shall limit looses on long trend by the way.Or we can make this hedging according to DD also.Aim will be the limitting the looses .İf we make compact hedging then the account profit will be locked on inverse movements.Eitherly it will be better to limit the number of orders by adding pip distance filtration perhaps.As a summary on my hedging model,hedge orders wont effect other orders closing rules that predicted on options.  
İt was just an idea,and hoping that Rodolpho will consider about this idea.He knows better.

Let me give a different point of view.  
Till now I didn't found any safe grid strategy.  
Soon or later you will face a big trend and account will blow.  
  
What about accepting that danger fact.  
  
Use what ever grid strategy you have and withdraw regularly the profit.  
If withdrawn money are more the initial balance no fear of blowing account because you already made money.  
If withdrawn is less than initial balance and you blown the account than you just lost money.  
It's just a probability game overall. Isn't it?

Yes its a probability game but as you know there are oversold or over bought levels.So we must protect accounts till those points.We will have loss on those strategies that are trading against trend.So if we limit looses with such ways like hedging we can protect our account till trend turns.But hedging mustnt be so rigid becouse we dont know when trend will turn.We can name this as light hedging.Aim is to limit the accounts loss by profitting from hedge orders.And when trend turns loose not much from hedging orders.

I agree with you.  
The problem is just account size and draw-down.  
On USDCAD my first order was Buy0 and price went against me.  
To rescue the loosing trade I use a manual grid.  
After 10 pips I opened Buy1+Sell1.  
After 10 pips I opened Buy2+Sell2 but I took profit from Sell1.  
After 10 pips I opend Buy3+Sell3 but I took profit from Sell2.  
etc...  
After a bit a increased the grid size to 2o pips, 25 pips and 30 pips.  
  
Price just continued to fall with a small pullback not enough to come out at BE.  
  
At certain point my DD reached 10% of account balance and that was too much for me to resist and I was already at 12 or 13 grid level.  
Never reached grid levels so high before.   
  
continue to fight the trend or cut the loss?  
I cut the loss taking around 10% loss.  
  
and that was my experience

I was looking into the code of the xbest v2.2 and I was trying to figure out what this lines mean  
  
m_symbol = Symbol(); //for example we are trading EURUSD, so m_symbol=EURUSD  
m_pip1 = 1.0 / MathPow(10, Digits - 1); //this equation is the secret to set the appropriate number to "step size in pips" and "take profit in pips"  
m_size1 = InpGridSize * m_pip1; // InpGridSize = 3 with the default settings  
m_take1 = InpTakeProfit * m_pip1; /// InpTakeProfit = 3 with the default settings  
  
  
Anyone have an understand what is this equation? What the hell is m_pip1

Hi Rodolfolm!It's a pity you can't continue to develop the great EA, could you kindly share the code, I am a developer from China, I want to continue develop the EA based on your gread work.

The comment at the code line is a bit weird, and in my opinion the equation for m_pip1 is wrong.  
The variable is supposed to hold the value for one pip. Meaning, for a 4/5 digit instrument, it is 0.0001; for a 2/3 digit instrument it is 0.01.

Rodolfo, estou testando a R3ptar 1.4 e gostando muito. Mas como alguém já postou anteriormente ela tem um problema onde algumas vezes abre uma ordem duplicada. Tem como corrigir isto? Estou testando em Time Frame M15 EurxUsd e UsdxJpy. Utilizando saldo de 3k e lote 0.01 em cada par. Alterei o martingale para 1.2. Também você comentou a respeito de colocar um filtro para evitar que continue abrindo ordens no mesmo sentido em caso de uma não reversão do mercado. Como está indo nesta questão? Gostaria de poder colaborar com teu projeto.

Is the equity caution in xBest 2.2 working? Does it close all position if it hit loss of say 20% of trading equity?

Hi Rodolfo, are you able to tweak the xBest 2.2 to close order at loss if it reaches % in equity? At the moment the equity caution at 20% does not function. The max spread also does not have any effect on actual spread. Meaning it will open orders even if the spread is higher then the standard max spread of 10

Hi rodolfolm,  
I've been testing your R3ptar v1.4 both in demo and using Tick Data Suite. In the backtest, the account doubles to 20k in one month using 10k starting size which is impressive, but my backtests are running extremely slowly. Would that be because of the separate mqh files? Do you have any tips to speed up backtests?  
Thanks.

What did you find the best time frame to use the R3ptar v1.4 default settings with if I may ask?

I haven't run enough backtests yet but it looks good on M1 and M5 at the moment. I'm running the tests on the full year 2017 on different pairs but my backtests are only up to March so far. No busted accounts yet but I do use a starting account size of 10k (USDJPY came close to busting).  
  
I'll post the backtests when they finish.

I've tested R3ptar v1.4 on EURUSD M1, AUDUSD M5 and EURCHF M5 in 2017 using tick data with 10k and default settings and they all blew the account by the end of the year. The backtests took about 3 days to finish so unless something's wrong with my PC it's not possible to optimise the settings - it would take too long. I'm going to start testing one of the other grid EA's in this thread.

yes, this is a high frequency HFT. works fine only when run with very fast connections. the real market is thus the one who arrives first in an arbitration takes the money and the others are left with the different of a simulation in which there is no negotiation at all.

What's the latest TRIO version anyone can give me? There was something in the configuration of it that I'll find in another profitable BOT, maybe that's what's missing. They are very similar.

Sorry for the late reply.  
m_pip1 is a pip-to-price-distance conversion.  
  
i also took a look at the code. i don't really agree with this conversion as it does not consider 5 digits and 3 digits brokers.  
  
Personally, i use this:  
pipsToPriceAdjustment = ((MarketInfo(Symbol(), MODE_DIGITS)== 5 || MarketInfo(Symbol(), MODE_DIGITS) == 3) ? 10 : 1) * MarketInfo(Symbol(), MODE_POINT);  
  
Usage:  
double TP_distance_in_pip = 5; // 5 pips take profit  
double curr_price = Bid; // using bid price as close price  
double open_price = OrderOpenPrice();  
if (open_price + TP_distance_in_pip * pipsToPriceAdjustment < curr_price) OrderClose( blah... );

Yesterday I downloaded and instaled TrioOrchestra on my real accounts, and I´m having some results.  
Some pairs not work good on it like GBPJPY and GBPUSD, and others are doing good.  
I´d like to know wich is the parameter to the TrioOrchestra close the open trades when it reach a higher value  
cause it works better just if I close bymyself the trades, cause if not it closes in a lower price  
Could someone give me the direction?!  
And about the IILAN 1.8? I couldn´t find here on forexfactory  
or some other place on google search.

I have a request: I think it would be great if put an **"conclusion of all discussion"** , **"all EA versions with their abilities"** and **"setfiles for all kind of accounts"** in first post of the topic. it will decrease **"repetitious question"** , **"repetitious requests"** and **"spam posts"**

Maybe your broker does not allow you to trade 0. 01 lot. Some only only allow you to trade 0.1 starting lot.

most mt4 brokers allow us using ea. the question is the smallest lot size allowed by them. some allow 0.01lot, some allow 0.1lot as smallest. check you ea setting, try change lot size from 0.01 to 0.1.

I'm using FIBO broker. i asked them about EA and they told me i'm allowed to use it. also i use 0.01 lot on demo and it works.  
/  
By the way i have a question: i use 3 or 4 EA on demo account. for last two week days all of them are negative and in lose! it's ok or it means something about EA or their parameters are wrong?

could be due to the setting, but most probably the trading strategy of the ea is not good. if you try an ea, try to run on 1 pair 1st. and you can learn faster by focusing on 1 pair. avoid gbp pair until brexit is done.

sorry i didn't and wouldn't test any of those ea you stated. i am more familiar with ilan ea. so , if you want to test, that's the best ea to test on demo, with multiplier = 1.0 and try tf h1 on ej.

i took a look at the ilan1.6 code.  
  
the grid/martingale mechanism is very similar to xbest2.2  
  
ilan1.6 entries are based on  
SELL: close_of_bar2 > close_of_bar1 AND RSI_of_bar1 > 30  
BUY: close_of_bar2 <= close_of_bar1 AND RSI_of_bar1 < 70  
  
when committed to a direction, ilan1.6 do not open a opposing position until all the positions are closed.  
  
the grid is used to average down the TP.  
  
there is not averaging of SL.  
  
there is a hard SL based on account equity.  
  
let me know if you want to tweak on these. i am more than happy to help you with this.

> {quote} i took a look at the ilan1.6 code. the grid/martingale mechanism is very similar to xbest2.2 ilan1.6 entries are based on SELL: close_of_bar2 > close_of_bar1 AND RSI_of_bar1 > 30 BUY: close_of_bar2 <= close_of_bar1 AND RSI_of_bar1 < 70 when committed to a direction, ilan1.6 do not open a opposing position until all the positions are closed. the grid is used to average down the TP. there is not averaging of SL. there is a hard SL based on account equity. let me know if you want to tweak on these. i am more than happy to help you with this....

Hi all,  
I have tried the R3PTAR_MindStorms.v1.4 on IC market demo account, and I've got the warning message: Account may be disabled due to HyperActivity.  
Is there any way to solve this? And which broker you guys are using for this ea? Thanks.

Hopefully the account I use is not a problem just because it doesn't use the FFCall indicator.

Hi woodyc, The pipstep setting is the spacing between trades that the ea must open new orders. For example if pipstep is 20 then the ea will open trades every 20 pips

Thanks fxwealth. So the takeprofit setting is measured in points and the pipstep setting is in pips?

You welcome. To me points and pips are the same. If you are trading with a four digit broker (not sure if they still exist) then 10 points or pips would be input as value of 10. If youre trading with a five digit broker then 10 would be input as 100. Hope Im making sense. Takeprofit and Pipstep settings can be different.

Hello everybody  
I'm using XBest 3.47 and I'm trying to do a backtest. But that doesn't work. The test runs, but no information or diagram is shown. What do I have to do?

Set FFCal to False. Do not use this on live and on small capital. It will blow your account. You can play around with step size in pips.

What do you mean ?  
In real account we should NOT put FFCal to False ?? we have to keep it true in real account ??

Hello Traders,   
  
Is the Original Trio Dancer EA able to control the previously opened positions by itself after a restart of MT4? Or does it lose control after a restart so an electric cut may kill your overall trades.  
  
I know we need to use a VPS but if it can control the previously opened positions after a fresh restart of MT4 session, then I beleive I can tolerate a few hours of electric cuts in higher time frames and won’t need a VPS; That’s why I ask. I’ll appreciate if someone enlightens me.  
  
Cheers. 

There are no weapons that will form against my financial prosperity.

Hopefully you have the answer, but what I know is that EA will continue and take into account all trade that is currently open.

Grid hedge are so risky in trend condition.   
So we need to filter for range condition only.  
Does forum has similar range Grid EA?

The distinguishing feature of a Trio Dancer includes using three strategies and using the averages in case of loss.One can evaluate the predictability through real trading.

would you kindly develop your 3 engine robot mach 3 or fx mach 3 or exbest again but a little bit change and that change is each engine opens trade according to its signal taken from its own moving average so all of three engines have their own moving average and open trade based on only moving averages not RSI OR HL OR any other indicator, for example engine one is set to trade on 5 daily ma , engine two is trading based on the 10 daily ma and engine three 15 daily houry or weekly as selected from menu. thanks

Here is what was requested.  
I also added the Maximum Drawdown achieved in real time which I borrowed from a compatriot, Trader55.  
Have fun. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f642.png?v=15.1)

Hello akkus45  
The problem must be that you are using a micro account.  
Try this modified version (I removed the MaxDrawdown function which could be the cause and which is only a non-essential option)  
Tell me if your problem is resolved.  
Have a good day.

Hello anantlee,  
Do you have the "Long & short" mode positions at the top left in "Common"?  
Otherwise, you may be on a fairly long time frame like H4 and as long as the trend has not reversed you will still be selling or buying.  
Try with a unit of time like M5 to see...  
Otherwise I take this opportunity to post a version that also displays the maximum margin used during the session, it can be useful...  
Have a good day.

Hello,  
Normally yes but I did a backtest on a platform where it was not there and it still works but with slightly worse results (- 25% difference on GBPUSD in M5 since January 3, 2022.)  
You can download it here:

Hello @transmat  
Thanks a lot for your wonderful works :-D  
I have just 3 questions:  
1\. I should Put this [Supertrend Plus Free.ex4](https://www.forexfactory.com/attachment.php/4124518?attachmentid=4124518&d=1642465766) in the indicator folder is correct? (What settings should i put here?)  
2\. Do you have a .set file with your best setings?  
3\. There are some warnings when compiling, is normal?  
  
Also when i try to run the code i have this error:  
  
  
I think it's related to this part o the code probably(I have used the Revb):  
  
I have seen that start again bypass the first error.  
Thanks again a lot  
Best Regards  
Stefano

Hello Stefano,  
Thank you for your compliments but I must specify that I am not the author of this EA unlike xJhamil, rodolfo.leonardo and maybe others...  
My participation was limited to the integration of the Super Trend indicator as requested in post N°1904.  
I also included the display of the maximum DrawDown which I did not code either but borrowed this part taken from another Expert Advisor which dates from 2013 or 2014, i.e. at a time when the mql4 language was a bit different than now and so it results in warnings when compiling but doesn't prevent it from working.  
On version 3_53 I added the maximum profit and the maximum margin used but which is declined from the maximum DrawDown so with the same warnings...  
To answer your questions:  
It is on version 3_53 that you have to place the "Supertrend Plus Free.ex4"  
in the "indicator" folder.  
In version 3_51 it is the "Supertrend Plus" but this one due to expire on March 1, 2022 I replaced it from version 3_53 by its successor the "Supertrend Plus Free" which by definition is also free.  
(see on the author's website on the header of the indicator)  
No, I don't have any particular parameters, these are the basic ones...  
For your error message, maybe you are using a penny account and in this case you must use version 3.51_b but you will no longer have the MaxDrawDown function (see posts N° 1908 and 1909)  
I put here a 3_51_c version with the "Supertrend Plus Free" indicator for penny account..  
Let me know if that works...  
Good evening. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Thanks again a lot @transmat and also thanks to @xJhamil and @rodolfo for all your work.  
Unfortunately i have tested this EA but in one day blow up my demo wallet 500€..  
I don't know why and if is a settings problem, did you know some alternative EA with less DD and also less Gain?

Hello Stefano,  
We must not forget that it remains a martingale and that with 500 € you have no chance, especially at this time.  
€50,000 would be more adequate to start at 0.01 lot and for a single pair...  
With a penny account, and with 500 € you will therefore have 50,000 cents displayed on your platform and starting at 0.01 lot, with a little luck to pass between the drops if you make 25,000 cents in profit over a year , that will be very good.  
50% profit for a risk of around 50% of the account if you are taken out by the market. (with a leverage of 30 which is the maximum in the European Union except to declare yourself as a professional)  
Don't be too greedy. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)

Thanks again a lot my friend :-D  
Do you have some suggestion for a good EA also with just 5€ per day or something else?  
Thanks a lot

Hello Stefano  
This one can do it with the adequate capital and especially between two liquidation accounts ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f62a.png?v=15.1)  
You put yourself on a demo account with 200,000 $ or €, on GBPUSD, EURUSD and Gold (or XAUUSD) for example with different MagicNumber A and B for each and starting at 0.01 lot.  
You mentally divide all the numbers you get by hundred which will give you the results in $ or € with 2000 $ or € on a penny account and you see what happens over several weeks or months.  
You will already have an idea of whether it is worth taking the risk in real life.  
Upload version 3_53 to post N° 1914 which will tell you the Maximum DrawDown as well as the maximum margin requested in the most critical moments.  
Here you will understand that I can only talk about this EA.  
Good continuation.

Hello anantlee,  
I suggest you delete the EA in your expert folder (the .mq4 file as well as the .ex4) and you close this one.  
Then you download the EA again, you restart your mt4 platform and you don't change any settings.  
Do a backtest in M5 on gbpusd for example over several days and see if it takes purchases and sales.  
Tell me if there are Sell and Buy.  
As for my great works, my contribution is minor for this EA (see post N°1918) ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
Best regard.

How can we reduce drawdown, can you share any good set file for minimal profits.

Here is what was obtained from January 3 until today February 7 in backtest with €100,000 and a low leverage of 30 on GBPUSD in M5 with the following set.

Congratulations but can you tell me what leverage was used for this account and what was the maximum margin requested (available on the chart) as well as the result in tick by tick mode?  
For me, it was just a quick test in M5 since January 3, 2022 and not since January 3, 2020... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Here's another test result. I modified the ea to use a different indicator so you won't be able to get the same result as I did.

Well done, very good overall result.  
I couldn't do better for the moment and I doubt that I can do it except perhaps by pushing the optimization to the extreme.  
And on other currencies do you have similar results over this same period?  
Looking forward to reading you.

Sorry but no I can not share the changed I made. It took me a very long time testing to get the result.

So far I have only tested with gbpusd but I plans to test other currencies soon.

Hello Toopi,  
How are you ?   
This EA was designe d to work entirely automatically and I have no idea if by adding a manual button, what should be done to make it work.  
I'm sorry but I can't help you with that.  
If anyone comes here and knows how to solve this problem, thank you for helping you.  
Have a great weekend. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Hello qasimranapk,  
I don't understand why it doesn't open any transactions.  
I think you checked Auto Trading correctly.  
Have you changed the basic settings?  
Choose an M5 chart for example and see if it takes positions after a while.  
Does another EA work on another chart? (to find out if the problem comes from the platform or from the EA)  
Have you placed the "Supertrend Plus Free.ex4" indicator (on post 1916) in the indicator folder?  
Otherwise, delete the EA in the "expert" folder (mq4 and ex4 files) turn off your platform and redownload the EA and do not change the basic parameters and see if it works this time on M5 or M1...  
Let me know.  
Have a nice week end.

Here is a script that will do the same job as your inactive button.  
For the first, just select the pair concerned (disable the others), the size of the lot and enter the MagicNumber...  
For the second the rapidFire, I set it for a single pair (modifiable in MétaEditor)  
For buy=true, sell=false.

I forward testing 2 weeks with all majors and minors. I use "xBest_MA_SuperTrend_Rv3_51_c" with M15. I have Equity Sentry v1.4c to control all trades. So when 1% profit all trades close and then it restarts for the new basket.

Nice result Toppi,  
You must be on 28 pairs.  
This is an account with what leverage?  
100% in 2 weeks... hope the account holds... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f603.png?v=15.1)  
With exit at 1% at each basket, it should avoid getting caught up in too big lots.  
Good continuation.

Lev 1:500. Yes, from start I use 0.01 lot/1000 dollars. Hard sometimes to come to 1% so I change to 0.01 lot/500 dollars and come faster to 1%. Now I test 0.5% target and also 0.2% on other accounts. Let's see what happens. Well. I don't really understand this gridEA. It takes only SELL order what I can see. I have to try different settings but don't get BUY order.

I saw that you had very little buy compared to sells, weird...  
Here is what I got since 19 11 2021 i.e. 3 months:  
Leverage 30, 100,000 cents on the account and only on Gold, eurusd and gbpusd and start at 0.01 lot.  
So the results are in cents...  
And I turn off the computer at night, which sometimes gives a very good result in the morning, which is visible on the graph.

Here are my settings for the gbpusd as well as the eurusd.  
But it is especially on Gold that it is very active.  
I already pass these tables and then the Gold.

In fact, the settings on the Gold are the same as on the gbpusd and eurusd, only the MagicNumbers are different. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f600.png?v=15.1)  
But there will be many more transactions on this one with often less than a point difference... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61d.png?v=15.1)

Hi transmat,  
Thank you for your contribution towards this EA. I have been running a couple of back-tests now and I was wondering if there is away to have this EA trade in one direction at a time (no hedging). For some reason, even when the hedge level is set to 0 - the EA opens trades in both directions rather than in the direction of trend/indicator. Is it possible to add an option to indicate if trades should open up in one direction vs both directions?   
  
Thank you again everyone for your help

I believe I figured it out. I just disabled both Engines (A&B) and that did the trick. As a side note, adding RSI to this EA might be beneficial.

Hi transmat,  
  
I have been playing around with the supertrend version of xBest and I was wondering if you (or anyone on this thread) can answers some of my questions:  
Note: I have both engines disabled and testing this EA while its trading in one direction at a time (no hedging)  
  
1) When I disable the MA, Supertrend and HILO signals, the EA still opens up trades. What is it opening these trades based on?  
2) When I disable the MA & Supertrend signals, and have the HILO enabled, the EA only opens up long positions. Is there a reason for this? (Also Invert Filter option for the HILO doesn't change anything-seems pointless)  
3) Is it possible to have an inversion filter option for the supertrend (trade with the supertrend rather than against it)? This would to deliver better results in my opinion  
4) Maybe even have an option for the entire EA to trade with the trend rather than against it (all indicators) - and close any open positions (as a safety measure) once the trend changes direction (supertrend changes...below/above MA)  
  
I guess some are suggestions rather than questions. I appreciate everyone's help with this matter.

Hello DavidRol2o,  
I remind you that it was not me who coded this EA (see post 1918).  
There are lots of things that escape me in coding because my level in this area is average.  
So why does he take positions even when everything seems closed? I do not know; I tried to go through the 2000 lines of code but after a while knots formed in my brain! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f975.png?v=15.1) You should ask the authors...  
However I added the possibility to choose the use of the MA and the supertrend in trend or against trend as well as the RSI as you requested.  
A quick BackTest allowed me to see that being in trend, the profits are down about 10% but the DrawDown is also about minus 25% as well as the requested margin, so overall it would be beneficial. It's up to everyone to try...  
Here is what I am able to do and I hope it will satisfy you.  
Good luck for the future.

Hi Transmat,  
  
Thank you for your wonderful contribution with the EA, I would like to ask if you can code the max buy trade level and max sell trade level and with stop loss to this ea [xBest_MA_RSI_Rv3_56.mq4](https://www.forexfactory.com/attachment.php/4172867?attachmentid=4172867&d=1648396542) version, so that if there is a drawdown it will not open many position.  
  
Thanks and more power to you.

Hi eric99,  
I spent several hours on it to try to limit the number of levels but there is nothing to do, I can't do it.  
I'm unfamiliar with this coding and everything I've tried gives no effect.  
If someone more competent than me comes through here and is able to show us the solution, we will gladly applaud it.  
However, you can intervene on the batch limitation which is already present either before launching the EA, or during work by bringing it back to zero manually when you judge that your limit has been reached. ( see if it can work...)  
Good luck at you.

Hi eric99  
Here's how to work around the problem:  
Here you set the maximum batch size you want:  
InpMaxLot = 1;  
for example 1 lot.  
You set this to false:  
similar_batches_hereafter = false;  
Here you display the following lot sizes:  
reduced_batch_size = 0.01;  
here 0.01 which is the smallest acceptable value and which will have little impact on the account.  
Hoping you will enjoy it...  
  
Sorry, I did the opposite of what I thought;  
Here is the correct version which corresponds to what I was saying for  
"similar batches hereafter".  
Once again, excuse me.

Hello amrhamdi,  
I'm sorry because the explanation only appeared with the code that had to be opened in MetaEditor to see it:  
similar lots hereafter  
If true = All subsequent batches are identical to the defined maximum  
If false = All subsequent batches are reduced to a value defined below.  
(the batches defined as following are those of recovery.)  
Here is version 3 57 c where the explanation appears in the table of parameters.  
Have fun.

Hello over here, Is this EA still updated or the devs and contributors have definitely abandoned the project?  
  
It is by far the most complete and optimized of those that I have been able to test, how sad ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1)  
  
Unless the devs have decided to release something even better?  
  
Thanks ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)
