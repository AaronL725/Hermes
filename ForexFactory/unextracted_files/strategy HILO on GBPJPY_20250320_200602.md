You need :  
on chart £Y UT240 :   
EMA8,  
SMA21 HIGH,  
SMA21 LOW,  
ADX 14,( gray),+DI (green), -DI (red)  
  
Strategy :  
  
Long : EM8 cross SMA21H at open next candle if ADX going up and +DI>-DI>15  
  
Short : EM8 cross SMA21L at open next candle if ADX going up and -DI>+DI>15

hi   
Long : i put my stop 10 pips under SMA21 LOW reverse if short ...  
I haven't a target ... I stay in the trade as long as em8 is out off sma21 HI LO ( it's very hard if you haven't a strong psy ... because £Y has a big volatity ) and the signal is to exit is when adx begin to go down or the cross +DI and -DI or price cross ema8  
  
regards

hi   
  
thank you for your quick response. But i have one more question ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61e.png?v=15.1)   
when you write > 15 is it the ADX line or the DI line   
  
Thanks again,  
  
Simon

for almeezan, adx14 1is too late ... you can use adx8 , i think , it's ok too ...  
  
for senbanda line15 AND 20 when +DI ans -DI are under this is a ragne period ans it will be better to be flat .  
  
About adx (gray line ) i m flat when it go down under line 40 ... and i tahe a trade when it go up !

Now , i give you others informations about my stratégy ...   
To mesure the volatility , i use Standard deviation 13 with levels 0,003 and 0,0015 for gbp/chf ut240 ( i determine the level with my feeling )  
To mesure the trend , i use sma55 ...

Hi BZH  
  
What pairs do you trade with this strategy? So far I have seen GBPJPY and GBPCHF which are the most volatile pairs, are these what you trade?

hi Howard !  
  
I trade £$, £Y,£F,$Y,$F ans sometimes €$,€F,€Y...only on UT 4H .  
  
I think my strategy is ok with alls pairs ...  
  
about volatilty , my favorite is £Y !!! ...  
  
but i must repeat ( it's very hard if you haven't a strong psy ... because £Y has a big volatity) you must have a strict money management !

On the first chart you posted it shows in the upper right corner that the chart has a EA attached to it. Is that EA this system? or something else

Thanx for the system, seems very promising.  
However (as anybody brings his own ideas), I backtested it for one month and found some good trades that could have been taken when ADX was lower than 14, actually flat and very low.   
  
I noticed that u take trades only when ADX is above 40, but if you look at the last few days, when ADX was above 40 level, the GY pair was flat, topping. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f615.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/2753.png?v=15.1)  
  
Also, I will try to see how it works on 1h chart, because I cant deal with such big stops - on 4h chart u need at least 200 pips stop if u place them under 21 SMAs. I cant handle more than 50 pips for a stop ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1)

According to BZH the ADX should be rising as an entry condition, no matter from what level; one of the exit rules is when ADX falls below 40 level.  
  
I find the system very simple and profitable if adhered to and with proper MM.  
  
Thanks BZH.

Hi  
  
The chart which you posted is for GBPCHF.  
How do you use Standard Dev for your trades?

Is it because 8ema has not yet crossed the lower channel?  
  
Your 4hr bar closes at 13 GMT, could you tell me which broker are you using and in what time zone are you located, my 4hr bar closes at 14GMT, so it will close in about 30 minutes.

Hi  
  
Are these 900 or more pips per month related to 2 pairs only : GBP/JPY and GBP/CHF and for 1 lot traded on each?

In my humble opinion, I think u dont need much education to understand what is GY or UF. The Forex slang is much more complicated than this, so I suppose every1 can figure himself the meanings of these abbreviations like I did.

I didn't take it because difference btwn +DI & -DI is less than 15... I'll wait..  
  
**breizhfx**  
  
What is the rule for a long?  
+DI > -DI and +DI > 15 ? or  
+DI > -DI and +DI - (-DI) > 15 ?  
  
I have backtested the last one (by sight) and it seems like it prevents from entering on false signals ...

Hello,   
this strategy is damn good. At least for strong trending times, like these days.   
The sad part is that I missed the last signal and Im missing all this wonderful upside action.   
  
You are right, with a strong MM, u can do very well with this strategy alone in the long term.  
  
Keep up the good work.

Hi am am new to this thread but so far it looks like an incredible system what about when the market ranges have you still had success when there is no trend and the market is moving sideways?  
  
  
Thanks,

So your saying that we should wait until it breaks through the 50 sma before making the trade that we are sure that the trend is changing to down?  
  
  
Thanks,

So are you saying that you reccommend using the 55 sma to determine trend and as long as the 4hr chart remains above 55 sma the trend is up?  
  
  
  
Here is my 1 hr chart...

Hi, about the trend , i look only UT240, but if you want to scalp ! you can use [UT30](http://bzh-forextrade.blogspot.com/)... I think this ut is good for to scalp GBP/JPY ...  
But becareful, scalp only with the trend UT240 ...

Bonjour, bzh, and thanks for sharing a very effective, simple approach.  
  
Are you including the 20 DMI level to give yourself a little more flexibility, or are you fairly strict about the 15 level, please ?

you said that you can scalp on the 30 min chart. But you also said to only trade with the trend. So are you using the sma 55 from the 30 min chart to determine the trend or are you using the sma 55 from the 4hr chart to dertermine trend trading with the 30 min chart.

Ok now let me ask you another thing what is the best way to filter out the ranges with this system?  
  
and  
  
  
What about the news do you still take the trades if the cross gives the signal even if there is news coming out?  
  
Thanks,

When you say ADX must go up do you mean it has to go up above 20 or above 40?

Also I watch the EUR/JPY also and I see that a cross just formed on the 4hr chart do think that this is a good signal to trade?  
  
Here is my chart...

Well I guess we got a good trade on Eur Jpy today. I bought at 161.75, ADX just jumped above 20 level. Im up 80 pips already.   
  
For GY no trades as ADX is still down and its dangerous.

when you say adx must be going up when we get the cross do you mean ADX must be above 20, 30 when the new candle open?

Dear trader,  
  
I think the creator of this strategy states clearly enough how he uses the ADX in the first page. Please look and read carefully again, because your continous questions about how to use ADX are becoming annoying and prevent us from improving this strategy more.  
  
Thank you for understanding.

Hi ,I like this system it's great(almost) just what i looking for ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1) . I noticed that cross on +DI and -DI makes good early confirming signal for exit or possible entry,very early signal which is really great(it means BEWARE - something is going on).I hope it helps someone .I use only 4H thats ok with me.  
  
  
  
P.S - Sorry for my bad english

Yes...it is good to have a bit of a warning ...sometimes you get too busy watching other signals to be aware of the +Di and -DI and what they are showing. Good point.

Yeah, you are so right, thats why I suggested it in the first place ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
I think we might have a sell trigger soon on both GBP/JPY and Eur/Jpy.

Did you guys take the short signal around 238.50? I guess the setup is perfect this time, ADX and DI- look very strong, so I really hope it will go down for a while.   
  
Cheers.

nope, i didn't take that short signal coz when i see on Daily charts , there's a strong support at 238.33. so does on 4H charts, there's a strong resistance at 238.80. so the price now beetween them. i just wait whether it's break up or break down. then i'll take the trade.   
  
hmm ... maybe yes, maybe no..

Can you tell me what helps us StdDev and can you define StdDev levels for others currency pairs .(I like this system a lot ,but for now i don't use this indicator. ADX tells me almost everything EARLY ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) \- almost , but i think the system needs something else too for times when price just bouncing up and down over 55SMA).

Thx to Breizhfx for the great system and thx for the people who always help the others in this thread, just wanna say thank you very much . And here's my last trade on friday ...  
  
Long AUD CAD @ 0.9212. The Reason for Long are :  
1\. Major Trend Up ..  
2\. 8 EMA (Yellow) Crossed High 21 SMA (BLue) (30M)  
3\. Std Dev 13 Up (30M)..  
4\. Adx 8 Up (30M)..  
5\. + di above 15 (30M)..  
6\. Above 55 SMA (Pink)  
  
SL = Low 21 SMA (Red) (30M) @ 0.9180  
TP 1 = 0.9232 ----> closed. +20 pips.  
TP 2 = 0.9264 ----> closed. +52 pips.  
  
total for my last trade +72 pips from Aud Cad ...  
Love this system ...

Hey breizhfx,  
  
I would like to test the EA on 4H GBPJPY, but as I see it, the EA for

Could you please clarify the settings or post this EA also,  
  
thanks in advance,

When u used sma5 close & sma6 open, did u still use sma21 high & 21sma low as entry ? or just sma5 close & sma6 open to determine u'r entry ...  
  
thx ... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

actually i've got some question to ask....  
  
since you put out 8EMA and replace it w/ sma5 & 6  
do we enter the trade if both sma5 & 6 cross sma21 H/L ??  
  
and btw u said you have a new version  
is it still the same strategy w/ improvement or it will be different ??  
  
i'm still trying to test this on demo acct

Nothing more to say the system is perfect. you may put 5SMA 6SMA and 8EMA and as you see 5SMA and 8EMA have almost same behavior at entry point. you can use cross between 5SMA and 6SMA as exit(or possible re-entry) confirmation and ,when DI+ and DI- has cross too the signal is very strong.

hi, myxi, my trade isn't closed yet. I see you are entering at the signal ! Good  
ium happy for you ! beautiful trade !!!  
  
About StdDev, this indicator is like Bollinger bands, but i prefere it to detect volatility and confirm the trend with adx ! this is the reason that my position was taken late than yours , because i have waited the levelcross and the confirm of the breakout of the resistance ...  
  
About EA, i use it in semiauto ... I prefere for this time ...

Ok I think I got it now...  
  
so you say the best time to have entered this trade was when standard deviation crossed the 0.3 level at the break of support?  
  
or do you also reccommend entering a trade if just ADX give us the signal?

Look at my chart !  
  
at the second vertical line dimgray ,+di cross -di very soon but adx go down. On this candle , ma5 has just beginning to cross sma21h ... And the best entry is the open of the next candle , because , +di crossed -di, sdt >0.3, adx & adx is going up !...

so your saying that we should not use EMA 8 anymore and even if we have the crossover signal if adx has not gone up yet we should wait until it does then enter the trade?

For the Standard Deviation, what Method (Simple, Exponential, Smoothed, etc) do you use in the settings, and what do you "Apply to (Open, High, Lo, Close, etc.)?"

IS this a long? This would have turned into a losing trade. Any suggestions?

should the best signal be when ADX is above 40 and when std cross over .3?  
  
  
Thanks,

Hello BZH,  
  
I have and followed this with interest - I did a search for ADX and came up with your thread, which sounds brilliant!   
I am new to using EA's, and had loaded it up on the MT4 platform on my memory stick. I opened it up yesterday to do some study at work on the set up , only to realize at the end of the day when my broker sent me a statement that I was entered into a position in my live account! Well, it entered long - on the top of the same leg you entered at 241.22. It went up a bit, then sank, getting to within 1 pip of my stop! I see there is a 100 pip stop and 300 pip target. I decided to leave it on and watch it - use it as a learning experience. Right now, I'm just below breakeven, so I am glad of the 100 pip stop (I trade the GBPJPY, so know you need that large a stop) I am just amazed that it held!  
What I would appreciate (and many others following this thread) is some guidance on the use of the EA. I did see any of the bars and data that is on the right side of your last chart - I think I was expecting to see that - is that not a part of the EA? It looks like a radar shot of what is happening across the timeframes, and a good visual to evaluate a position. I take it the daily average is the ATR? What period do you use? Your explanations would go a long way to helping me and others embrace this strategy and your EA. You say you use it on semi- auto; which bits do you do manually and where do you allow the EA to take over or start?  
Many thanks for this brilliant strategy![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Hi again, BZH  
  
I thought you would be flat - since you trade in the direction of the 240 min trend, as determined by the 55 SMA, which is currently below price, indicating it is still in an uptrend, but you entered into a short position on the 30 min chart. I see that the 5 SMA had crossed the 21 L on the 240 chart, but the short trend had not been fully established. Are you using another set of rules? A tighter stop and limit perhaps?  
  
Thanks,

Hi BZH,  
  
Thanks for the charts. Looking at the 30 min chart, you seem to have posted your entries (red dotted vertical lines) once the 56sma have crossed correctly, but it still had not crossed the 21 low sma. Is this an adjustment for the scalp trade, but using the original rules for the main 240 trade? It might help to give us your 30 min scalp rules - I thought it was about the same as the 240 min one, but it may not be.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f615.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/2753.png?v=15.1)

>  Thanks for the charts. Looking at the 30 min chart, you seem to have posted your entries (red dotted vertical lines) once the 56sma have crossed correctly, but it still had not crossed the 21 low sma. Is this an adjustment for the scalp trade, but using the original rules for the main 240 trade? It might help to give us your 30 min scalp rules - I thought it was about the same as the 240 min one, but it may not be.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f615.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/2753.png?v=15.1)

Heriyadi -   
  
the way I understand it, we don't have a long entry till the 55 SMA - white on your chart- is BELOW price action. The 5sma needs to have crossed ABOVE the 21H, and the other factors (rising ADX, SD >0.3 etc) It looks like BZH may use the 30 min to scalp, but I still am not sure of his criteria, since he says to follow the 240 trend (as defined by the 55 sma), which was still short as of your chart, and seems to be satisfied with the 5/5 sma cross, not waiting for it to cross the 21 H/L. Perhaps he will elaborate? Some recent charts he posted were not strictly following his original rules as I read them - there are daily charts now in the mix. There seems to be some 'early' entries, before all the original criteria are satisfied, esp the trend part, so I think that one must be aware that it may not be a strong entry, might even reverse, and manage it accordingly.  
Hope that helps,

Hi traders !  
I must sayt to you some things about the rules !  
  
I ALWAYS trade with the trend ! but i have two technical : trade with 4H chart or scalping in 30mn chart.  
  
when i trade on 4H chart , i take a trade in the same direction of daily and weekly and PRICE with MM55 ( above long , under short) on 4H chart !!!  
  
when i trade 30 mn , i take a trade in the same direction of 4H and daily and PRICE with MM55 ( above long , under short)   
  
For founding the trend , i use the cross of DI ... look at the chart !

I must be missing somethig about the various entry criteria: I thought trend was determined solely by the position of price in relation the the 55 SMA. I'm not sure how the DI plays into it, by which I assume you mean the DI+ and DI- crosses (components of the ADX)   
  
Looking at the daily chart, there is the beginnings of a cross of the 5 sma above the 6 today, but it has not crossed the 21 H. The 55 SMA is below price, so is that indicating an updtrend?   
  
The 4 hr chart shows the 5/6 SMA cross had occured 11 June, but the 5 sma did not cross the 21 H till 21 June at 8 am EST, BUT, price is still below the 55 SMA! At which point would you have entered a long position for the 4 hr trade? Will you wait for price to rise above the 55 SMA on the 4 hr chart or not, thus using the long price position from the daily? and would you wait for the 5 sma to cross the 21 H or not (or should that be a cross of the 21 L)?  
  
For the 30 min scalps, if we traded in the direction of the daily, that would be long for quite a while back. If we use the 4 hr trend, it was mainly short from 7 June till early today if I am still using the 55 sma as the trend guide. I suppose my question is, if you have the correct 5/5 sma cross, and adx is rising, you can enter a scalp trade on the 30 min without waiting for crosses of the 21 H/L?  
  
Love this trade idea, but seem to be getting confused on the various entry criteria lately. Please help!

i don't know if breizhfx invented this system or copied it from somewhere else, but making it public attracts my gratitude!  
i made my own ea based on his system and i'm testing it for about a week and i say it is **very very** promising! i'll test it for a while, and if everything's ok, i'll go live and from first profit i'll donate breizhfx a good portion of it!  
and then i'll begin managing accounts ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1) , but that's another business....  
again, thanks for the system and you will hear from me in the near future!

Hi MM,  
  
Mind telling us what your parameters are? I think I understand them, them something turns up and I am left wondering. I would like to know what seems to work out in your testing - I'm assuming you use both the 4 hr and 30min (to scalp) timeframes?  
Any chance we could access your EA?![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

Hi,  
thks marketMaker !  
I invented this system. It is the consequence of long searches(researches). i ' gave this system because I consider that everybody has to have a part of this magnificent cake on this market of the FOREX... Other thing, EA is not perfect !. I made it by means of a site of assistance for the programmation .because I am not a programmer mq4. If somebody nice could help me to make this automatic system more perfect it would be superl!  
  
excuse me about my english , im french !

Hi, cliff, scuse me , if you short , you haven't understood my system ... the best entry was about 241 , 00 . If you haven't taken this trade you are late about 400 pips !!! now it' s too late to take a long position on 4H chart . The only possibility is to try to catch the trend on 30 mn chart !!!!

Thanks so when you took that trade at 241.00 long on the 4 hr chart you just waited for the 55 ma to be on the long side and adx to be up?  
  
Also on the 30 min you are waiting until adx goes above 40 and ma 55 above market?  
  
  
Thanks.

Yes ! ipost my futur entries !  
  
hi traders ,  
  
Somethings about standard deviation indicator ...  
The chances of success of the trade are very good when standard deviation indicator is >0.5 or more . i' ve determined that 0.3 is good , but look at the chart ! when it's >0.5 ... [marvellous !!!](http://breizh-forex-trading.over-blog.fr/)  
  
Other things, I decided to delete the ma55 and to take trades in the direction of the weekly and daily , always when ma5 cross the hilo.I considere that the entris are much bette !

Do you think that the eur/jpy could be a possible buy soon if standard deviation rises above 3 and adx goes back up above to 40?

hi, mando , i tell you , don't trade €$ !!! ...  
If you compare [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") between €$ and £Y, the advantage is in the eurodolllars, but on the potential of earnings pips, it is the pound/yen !!!!!!!

today the second week of testing is ending. i tested the method on three accounts with different pairs on each account, with 1/5 of equity used on each trade, thus compounding with every rise in equity. does anybody guess how well those accounts went??  
  
  
  
  
  
one _5 times_ starting balance, one _6 times_ and last one _3 times_!!!!!! and that in just 2 weeks!  
  
don't you believe me? look at them. in account history they have "adx" or "adx trend" comment.  
i use my own ea based on this system, and at the beggining of testing, not knowing exactly when to allow live trading, there were a few unjustified loosing trades, but after that all went well.  
anyway, next week i go live, and as i promised, i'll donate breizfx a portion of first profits as father of this system...  
here are the accounts and investor passwords to check the last 2 weeks trades. thanks for reading and i wait for your comments.

here is a question because I wasn't sure about this if the market is above the high low on the 4hr chart for gbp/jpy and adx is going down and then the market remains above the high low and then adx rises back up again do you think we should take that trade?  
  
  
Thanks,

This is very similar to Joe Ross's Camelback technique. About the only difference is he uses different period MAs, only one MA outside the High/Low channel, and no other indicators.

_Hi breizhfx let me ask you when you are trading this system on a 4hr chart and you get the signal and then you enter with confirmation on a 30 min chart what is the best way to try and catch the big moves. Should you keep the position open until the 4 hour moving averages 5,6 cross?

hi traders,   
  
if somebody like woodies CCI , i give another system : the name wood hilo system ...  
You need chart 1 hour with :  
ma 5 soma55  
hilo 21  
first woodies 13.5.5 & ma 5 weighted on first Indicatortor's data  
second woodies 65.25.25 & ma 25 weighted on first Indicatortor's data.  
  
the rules :  
price are above the hilo , you look for a long trade  
  
price are the hilo , you look for a short trade  
  
i put two examples :  
  
if you don't know woodies , [you can learn here ...](http://www.trading-naked.com/woodie1ccisystem.htm)

HI CLIFF , diamani is an Indicator to measure the volatility. With my first test , i think that it is better than standard deviation ...Especially in the beginning of the crossing of the green and white line ... but there is a red line , and i don't know, for the moment, the meaning ..

The red line is NO TRADE zone when green line is below white line, you can see the NO TRADE wording on the indicator as well

I was demo trading this strategy I thought the best entry is when we have a long cross 21ma signal on the 4 hr chart adx is going up 40. Then I thought we are supposed to enter at the open of the next 4 hr candle as long as adx is rising.  
  
So what then does the 30 min have to do if we are trading off the 4 hr?  
  
maybe Im confused...  
  
Thanks,

Sorry , cliff, i don't often use the 30 chart ;I use it sometimes , only if I missed the signal of 4 hours . The cross of hilo is the good signal .  
Yesterday , the signal was very good post #189 (155 pips in the pocket !! , very cool )

Hi bzh  
  
nice trade I was not up for this one what is the best way to alert yourself when the gpy/jpy breaks important support or resistance levels becuase I was looking at 249 as a break of resistance.  
  
Also how is the damini indicator going?  
  
  
Thanks,

hi cliff , i explain , the yellow dot line of left to right :  
  
the 1 st line shows a hook of adx line, it 's riskly to take a position in this bullish move on 4 hours chart , but it's possible to take it on 30 mn or 1h charts because we are in the trend of weekly .  
  
the 2nd line shows diamani says not trade and you can confirm with the standard deviation which less than 0.3.  
  
the 3rd line shows the cross of ma5 & ma6 , adx going up std is going to cross 0.3 , and diamani says trade ! and you buy at the open of the candle which is after the third line ..

Thanks for the great explaination at the top of page. Now I think I get it so then you are now going to add damini to the system permanent or are you still testing?  
  
  
Thanks,

trend is up price & hilo above smm55  
  
trend is down price & hilo under smm55  
  
buy if : ema 5 cross smm21 high & and adx >20 & going up( better if adx cross 40) & sdt cross 0.3 or >0.3 ( better if sdt cross 0.5)  
  
sell if : ema 5 cross smm21 low & and adx >20 & going up( better if adx cross 40) & sdt cross 0.3 or >0.3 ( better if sdt cross 0.5)

Hi BZH,  
  
I was under the impression that the 21ma's were simple, but it appears that's incorrect, and it should be smoothed? Plotting it like that, my 55SMA now falls in between the 21h and 21l (currently touching the 21l)   
Please confirm that is correct.  
  
Thanks again,

Thats incredible for one day of trading! Quick question though I understand why you took the buy but why did you take the sell isn't that against the trend?

Hi all!  
  
I am quite new to the MT4 software, only has a demo account for it (interbank), and I am using it to try and get a feel for BZH's system.  
  
So, I applied the experts he posted to the relevant 4H charts. GBPCHF recently fired off a buy order, and I am rather puzzled. I mean of course the pair is in an uptrend, but using the default setup described here (with 5MA and 6MA instead of the 8MA), I cant see any cross for the fresh 4H bar.  
  
Anyone got the alert too, or I am doing something seriously wrong?

I would never have enough guts to let a script handle my real money, so like you, I intend to use these EAs as signal-alert only. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
But I am afraid my French has failed me: could someone please provide me a link to the part of the blog where I can find the new settings? Thank you!

hi traders ,  
here your have perhaps a signal at the next candle ...  
sdt is ok , but ema5 are in the hilo & adx is going down , you must be flat !!!  
  
about diamani , after more check, i dont use diamani on 4 hours chart, i use it only on 15 30 or 1 h ...  
  
ps ; becarefull price are near 248.40 , a breakdown perhaps !!!

hi , again ...  
  
look at the daily chart since the beginning of the year , today this the fourth red candle ! perhaps a presignal of a big bearish move ...  
  
for me long is not possible today because weekly and daily are bearish ... i m looking only for a short trade .... and i tell you my entry ...

hi ,   
  
Now that you are used to read adx & sdt, it is possible to put them on the same window. and with this configuration , the level of standard deviation is 20... look the chart ....

MN to 15 mn , but the management of the trade is very different with the low time frame , but i prefer 4h to 30 mn sometimes 15 mn compressed , not 5n & 1 mn ...

Hello BZH,  
  
Great work tweaking this - and great trading!   
Could you just clarify a point here - you mentioned that the trend of both the daily and 4 hrs was the direction of your trade ie short. When I pulled up my daily chart with your new settings, the price was still firmly above the smma89, but was below on the 4 hour. Are you really still using that smma89 to determine trend, or something else (maybe the signal bar indicator on your chart?)

Hi BZH,  
  
Do you use the default settings, or use some other settings for this indicator, such as for the Sto and MACD. If you do, the settings you use would be appreciated.

Your right! by the way when you trade you say that you use a trailing stop how many pips do you reccommend trailing stop for gbp/jpy?

hi, now we cant use mahilo system 4 hours, we must wait price in the hilo ( the hilo is at 200 pips of the price ). but it's possible to use 1h chart or 30 mn with a breakout of highest or lowest ...

Hi BZH,  
  
Your system rocks![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f911.png?v=15.1) \- I'm still trying to pinpoint entries, and think you use a combination of 4hr 1hr and 30min charts.   
I see that if you are awaiting a trade on the 4 hr, you can switch down to lower time frames to see if it has 'fired'. My question is - do you use all the criteria for the lower timeframes, or just the correct 5/6 ema cross? I think that, if you are close to satisfying all the conditions on the 4 hr, all you need is the 5/6 cross. Or should I also make sure the hilo, adx and sd conditions are met?  
  
Next question - I think you have an ea (or someone does) out there, and would like to use it as an alert, not to place the trade. I did download one in the past, but it entered me into a trade, which I did not want. How do I just get the alerts and not activate the EA?  
  
Last question - how to connect to your demo a/c. I think I need to download the demo too?  
  
Thanks again,  
  
mac18

BZH Nice trade yesterday on gbp/jpy got in short for also 100 pip. By the way last night it broke daily support which was 238.26 and created a new low at 237.50 so do you think now the downtrend is still intact or maybe a reversal?

Well no of us our perfect however I think that you are a very good trader with very high percentage of winning ratio we all take a loss now and then but your system works but like you said no one can predict perfect.  
  
YOu think now gbp/jpy go up?

hi ,  
about my new settings ( 8 ==> 34) of adx .  
  
Remember :  
  
**Go long when +DI is above -DI and either:**

  1. ADX rises while +DI and ADX are above -DI; small arrow (good signal)
  2. ADX turns up from below +DI and -DI. big arrow ( strong signal )

Exit when +DI crosses below -DI.  
  
**Go short when -DI is above +DI and either:**

  1. ADX rises while -DI and ADX are above +DI; small arrow (good signal)
  2. ADX turns up from below +DI and -DI. big arrow (strong signal )

Exit when -DI crosses below +DI.  
  
look at the [chart

hi i wanted to take the long trade yesterday but didnt cause of the BOE inflation report. Apparently, I should have ignored the news except that i thought the news will go against me. Do you trade upon every signal or will watch out for upcoming news...

Hi BZH it seems your system has gone through a lot of adjustments but it is a great system. I'm a little confused as to the best settings to follow now with all the updates. So Could you post the new updated system settings please...  
  
Thanks again,

I have tried to seek for financial help to fund but did not work,so i have decided to give this system out to the world to use make money,if this is how i will help humanity,then i have contribution  
  
system introduction  
  
this trade strategy uses smooth ma, r.s.i and platform scale measurement.it trades maximum of 5-6 a month ,its same setting for 1 and 4 hr chart .  
  
Strategy entry parameters   
  
1 10 smoothed ma   
2 4 smoothed ma shift -1  
3 rsi 14 mark 55 and 45  
4 vertical scale line f-f ( friday to friday)  
  
working operation  
when the 4 ma crosses over 10 ma then wait for rsi to move either below 45 to 43 to the sell. Then sell;.at a valid scale  
  
when that also happens to the buy and rsi above 55 to 57 then buy at a valid scale  
  
  
valid scale  
the f-f( friday to friday ) scale is said to be valid when distance between the swing low of previous scale to the point where the ma made the cross over is up to 400 pips,or distance between the last swing low to point of ma cross over is up to 500 pips,then all parameters are valid to place a sell order.vice versa for a buy scale measurement.  
  
  
This strategy has what i call a neutralize order whereby a lost turns back ur money if the trade turns against u. If this happens u just leave the trade for a longer time max 10 days to trade itself in  
  
  
the main order setting  
tp=200 pip  
sl=450 pip  
  
neutralizer  
tp= 450  
tp= 450  
  
i have to simplify this by attaching a recent platform page,make the money and remember this fellow ,thank u peace.
