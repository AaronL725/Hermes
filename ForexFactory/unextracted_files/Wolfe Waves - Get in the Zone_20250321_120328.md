**Hello traders and welcome to the wonderful world of Wolfe waves!**  
  
This thread is meant to be a place where newbies and/or experienced professionals can come together to share, learn, and encourage.   
  
_**The rules are simple:**_ Be respectful and professional. Anything less won't be tolerated.  
  
Before we get started, I would like to acknowledge Bill Wolfe, the founder of Wolfe wave analysis. I am grateful to have stumbled upon his work. A quick overview can be found here:

If you're a struggling trader, frustrated and ready to give up, or just an all out system hopping, account blowing, psychotic indicator junkie, then this strategy just might be the perfect antidote for your trading endeavors. Or, if you are a seasoned professional, this strategy might simply be a nice addition to your trading tool box. In either case, Wolfe wave analysis provides a mechanically simplistic method to enter a trade in the so called "sweet zone". These trades have a high probability of success. In addition, the very nature of the Wolfe wave structure allows you to mitigate your risk through very well defined stop loss areas.  
  
Just to clarify up front, I don't claim to be a Wolfe wave guru. Most of what I have learned has come from pouring over 1000's of charts for the past 6 months. There are a few free online resources, but other than regurgitating the basic wave structure along with a fleeting mention of the sweet zone, I haven't seen any real discussion as to how you locate the best price to enter into the trade. Do you enter at the trend line break, half way into the sweet zone, at the bottom of the sweet zone, or do you wait for a clear reversal with some sort of confirmation tool? This is the paramount question that we are trying to answer.  
  
  
**For ease of discussion the following acronyms will be used:**  
  
**WW = WOLFE WAVE**  
**CWW = CLASSIC WOLFE WAVE**  
**HWW = HORIZONTAL WOLFE WAVE**  
  
I think it's best to fully delve into the CWW structure first before discussing the HWW.  
I put this diagram together as a quick reference as to what constitutes a valid CWW.  
  
**Note:** I use **XABCD** to describe the wave instead of the normal **12345**. The reason being is that most traders are likely very familiar with the **AB=CD** concept and it is an important tool used here in determining the entry price for our trades.  
  
**HERE IS THE CLASSIC WOLFE WAVE STRUCTURE**

**The Sweet Zone**  
  
In my opinion, the sweet zone is the most important part of the Wolfe Wave trading strategy. It baffles me that traders rarely discuss this topic. Understanding the parameters of the sweet zone is paramount to getting the best possible entry price. Sweet zones can be anywhere from 3 to 300 pips depending on the steepness of the wave and/or the time frame being traded. So the question is, where do I enter the trade? What criteria should I use? What tools should I use? And where should my stop loss be placed? I'm glad you asked. These questions and more will be discussed in detail as we progress forward in our study.  
  
Let me make an analogy that I find pertinent to this discussion. Hopefully most traders here are familiar with Major League Baseball. In my opinion, trading in the sweet zone is very similar to a major league hitter when he gets into the batter's box. If you talk to a professional baseball player about hitting, they will tell you that their main objective is to hit the ball hard. It doesn't matter where the ball ends up or if they make an out, their goal is to hit the ball hard? How do you hit the ball hard. Well, you make sure you make contact on the "sweet" spot of the baseball bat. How do you do that?   
  
**Preparation and patience** \- Make sure your cleats are clean. Make sure your bat isn't cracked. Make sure your gloves are in good condition. Make sure you know as much about the opposing pitcher as possible in advance. What kind of pitches does he throw? What's his "go-to" pitch? What kind of release angle does he have? Side arm? Over the top? How has he pitched you in the past? What stage of the game are we in? Are there runners on base? Is he showing signs of exhaustion? Having considered all of those things, the hitter will try and "wait" for "his" pitch. By being prepared, patient and cognizant of all of the pertinent information around him, he is then in a good position to try and force the pitcher to throw a pitch that is right in his sweet zone. And when that happens, the odds will be stacked in his favor. You get the point I'm sure.  
  
Do your due diligence and be patient. Let the price come into your sweet zone. Make sure your working area is prepared. Make sure your mind is prepared. Make sure you have mapped out all of your potential trades in advance. A hitter stepping into the batter's box is the same as a trader who is monitoring price action as it approaches the sweet zone. If he isn't prepared, he might not hit the ball very hard. In fact, he might even strike out. If we as traders aren't prepared we may miss the sweet zone or worse yet, strike out altogether.  
  
If a hitter makes contact with the sweet spot on the bat and makes an out, he may be disappointed, but he knows that he has done his job. Maybe he smacked a one hop sizzler only to see the second baseman make a spectacular diving play. Or maybe he hit a line drive right on the sweet spot that went directly towards the left fielder for and easy out. It doesn't matter, he did his job, he hit the ball hard right on the sweet spot. He may be frustrated at that moment, but a true professional knows that eventually, the hits will come, the runs score, the production will increase.  
  
In the same way, a trader's only objective is to "hit" the trade right on the sweet spot. Maybe the trade failed because of a surprise news event, or a low liquidity stop loss run. Maybe the trade failed for reasons we can't explain. So be it, we can analyze what may have gone wrong and add that knowledge to our mental toolbox for the next time we step into the batter's box. As long as we poured every bit of due diligence and discipline into entering that trade at the best possible price within the sweet zone, then we have done our job. We know that over time the winners will come, the pips will pile up, the accounts will grow.   
  
**EXIT STRATEGY**  
  
Every good entry needs a good exit. Below is my mechanical exit strategy ( I like to divide my positions up into 3 equal parts). I use the X, C, and A points as my reference points for exit. It is likely that there will be an increase in price action at these points just based on the nature of S/R. I would actually be setting my TP levels 5-20 pips below these three levels based on the time frame. I am generally very conservative with my TP's. I don't want to set my TP right at the level only to see price reverse significantly without banking some pips.  
  
**Note:** When price reaches TP #1 just shy of level X, then the SL's for the two remaining positions are moved to BE.

**THE WOLFE WAVE INDICATOR SET**  
  
Below is the best set of Wolfe wave indicators ever produced (in my humble opinion). There are actually 3 with instructions for each. Member "Parviz1953" has worked extremely hard on developing, modifying, and improving this indicator. A big thank you to him for his generous gift to this thread. I will post the most recent version when a new modification is made.  
  
**1)version 8.5:** Is a manual one, you click the button and select which depth and either complete or potential CWW is what you want.

**2)version 9.7.2:** Is automated one, it looks for all possible combination and when it finds them draw a button for each so that you may select which one you are interested in, and it shows you its characteristics. In this version when the indicator find all the possible patterns, it stops and does look for them only once, if you want to see the latest ones press "**Search Again** " button (indicator does not repaint) **New feature:** FIB projection values. This feature is useful when for example in potential CWW you want to know how much more CD has projected beyond AB=CD

**3)version 9.6.1** : Basically is the same as 9.7.1, except that, it does not stop searching after finding CWW, and always look for new ones as they are developing and thus "Repaint", if you want to halt the program, by clicking button for any pattern, program stop searching and so you can examine the selected pattern as long as you want, without losing it, if it find a new pattern. By clicking "**Search Again** " button,you may restart the indicator again.(this version uses a lot of the CPU time,since it is always running and doing a lot of calculations

**Note:** There is no short cut to becoming proficient in trading Wolfe waves or trading any other method for that matter. I believe it's imperative that traders take the time to learn how to draw Wolfe waves manually. Having a working knowledge of the structure and the ability to spot them on your own will go a long way towards improving your results. Having said that, this indicator is simply fantastic. It's so versatile and user friendly. As you read through the thread (and I hope you do), you will see how many modifications and improvements have been made. This will give you a strong skill set in knowing how to use this indicator to your advantage. Please understand that this indicator will find many many WWs. You will find waves with excellent symmetry and some with horrible symmetry. Some waves will be very steep angled and others will be nearly horizontal. It's your job to sift through these waves and find those that offer the best potential. Well structured waves with several layers of confluence are the diamonds in the rough and offer the highest probability for success.  
  
**FILTERING YOUR TRADES: POST #1286**  
  
  
Please feel free to post your charts with any questions. I am here to learn just as much as you are. Maybe you have some good filters to share with us or different parameters when entering a trade. We are all in this together. My hope is that "iron will sharpen iron" and that the end result will be a growing group of seasoned Wolfe wave gurus.  
  
**FINAL THOUGHTS**  
  
WWs work on all pairs, time frames, and instruments. WWs are often the endpoints of other larger more complex harmonic structures. I have noticed that pairs and the market in general tend to go through harmonic phases. Set ups seem to be developing everywhere. Other times, price action looks like a gazelle running away from a cheetah.   
  
Be especially careful when trading volatile pairs on smaller time frames. Trying to trade the GBP/NZD on a 5 minute time frame during low liquidity with a 5 pip spread isn't very prudent. There are many set ups every day so there is no need to force a trade during these high risk scenarios.  
  
Be mindful of news events. Active trades on smaller time frames are very susceptible to spikes and widening [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide").  
  
When monitoring your active trade, be cognizant of any smaller WWs that are developing inside the bigger wave. These smaller waves could give you a clue that it is time to bag the pips and manually end your trade.  
  
But most of all, make sure you are enjoying the chase. Trading is hard work and can be frustrating at times. For me, the best feeling in the world is stalking, executing, and then winning the trade. Trading is my job and I absolutely love to go to work!!  
  
**PERSONAL NOTE**  
  
My name is Kurt. I am a 50 year single parent of a beautiful 5 year old girl. I'm generally pressed for time but will do my best to respond to any questions, comments, or concerns. I spend a lot of time mentoring and volunteering at my daughter's kindergarten class. I'm also very much involved in ministry and the community at large. Trading has been a hard journey but a rewarding one. It was never about the money, it was always about the freedom. Trading has truly been a blessing in my life. Good luck to all who have the dream and thank you for participating in this thread.  
  
**"A problem is merely an opportunity to find a solution"**  
  
What follows are a couple of initial examples of CWW's with accompanying explanations as to how I determined what would be the most prudent sweet zone entry price.

Pictured below is a CWW that exhibits near perfect symmetry. What I mean by that is that AB and CD are nearly the same length in pips. In addition, both legs took exactly 12 candles to complete. That's all fine and dandy, but the problem still remains; where do we enter our trade?  
  
If you look at where the trend line is broken compared to where the bottom of the sweet zone is, well, that's about 100 pips. Even though this is a 4H TF, that's still looks like a lot of potential risk. If we enter at the trend line our SL would have to be upwards of 150 pips which is completely unacceptable. So what do we do?  
  
The first thing I do is map out the wave. After some chart time, the developing waves will jump off the screen at you. When you see a wave entering the D leg, map it out. In that way, you will already know in advance exactly where you are going to scale in, provided the structure is still valid when and if price reaches that zone.   
  
**MAPPING OUT THE WAVE**  
  
1)Draw the red trend line, the green target line, the yellow trend line and the other yellow parallel extension line. Use the diagram in post 1 for a reference.  
  
2)Put the XABCD points on the chart in the appropriate spots. It may seem silly to do this as you already know where those spots are, but for me its about due diligence and complete visual clarity, especially when teaching, discussing, or learning from others  
  
3)Using the zigzag indicator, find and mark the AB=CD completion level.   
  
4)Put the BC fib extension on your chart. You'll be surprised how many times the AB=CD completion level matches up perfectly with one of the fib levels.  
  
5)Given the TF that you're in, look back an appropriate distance in time to locate any previous zones of critical S/R and mark them as rectangular zones  
  
6)I don't use them but some people like to have a look at the Bollinger bands.  
  
**Not always, but as a general rule, you will notice these repeating patterns:**  
  
1) WWs with flatter angles tend to reverse at the 113 or 127 fib extensions  
2) WWs with moderate angles tend to reverse at the 141 or 161 fib extensions  
3) WWs with extremely steep angles tend to reverse at the 200 to 261 fib extensions  
  
Obviously there is going to be some subjectivity in determining exactly where the entry price is going to be, but with more and more chart time you will become extremely confident in your entry point.  
  
In the example below, I didn't find any previous S/R that lined up with the sweet zone but the fact that AB=CD landed right on the 161 fib made it a no brainer. Either scale in with very small positions starting at the 141 fib down to the 161 fib, or wait until price is much closer to the 161 fib and scale in with fewer larger sized positions. In both cases the SL is going to be at least half way to the 200 fib (depending on risk parameters, SL could also be below the 200 fib).   
  
**Bottom line:** By doing our homework in advance, we have mitigated our risk substantially. Of course this example is a cherry picked winner, but ultimately it was a 400 pip move to the target line with a SL as little as 50-100 pips depending on the risk management parameters.  
  
**Note:** Bill Wolfe was trading stocks and equities when he founded his wave theory and as such had access to true market volume. He noted that volume should spike up at the point of reversal. This makes sense as most reversal areas are basically a battle between bulls and bears. Unfortunately, forex broker volume isn't necessarily indicative of true market volume. Still, on occasion I will have a look at the MFI (Bill Wiiliams market facilitation index) just to see what's going on in the retail world

Zooming in to the hourly chart illustrates the challenge we face in deciding where to enter the trade. If you notice on the way down to the ultimate reversal point, there are two price bounces of about 50 pips each. If we had entered at the original trend line break, then where would our stop be placed? Likewise, if we entered at the second bounce, where would our SL be? Also, check out the TDI indicator at the bottom. It's very choppy as price is heading down to the true reversal price. Point being, the AB=CD makes this problem go away. We might miss the trade if price never reaches that point, but we have mitigated our risk substantially.  
  
This also brings up another point, and that is, why don't we just wait for a TDI cross and then enter the trade. A Valid point and there is nothing wrong with doing that. The only difference is your SL will be greater, especially on the higher time frames.

This example doesn't exhibit the same symmetry. Price ultimately reversed about 46 pips before AB=CD completion. That's not really too much considering this is on the daily TF.  
  
Anyways, we go ahead and map it out. As is often the case the AB=CD ended right about at the 161 fib. Again, we have the same problem. We have about 140 pips from the TL break to the bottom of the sweet zone to contend with. Do we jump in at the 127 fib? Maybe we scale in at the 141? Well, before making that decision I zoomed out and noticed some very distinct previous S/R. Take a look at the second chart to see what I mean. Problem solved. I either scale in from the 127 fib or wait until price gets near the 141 fib and scale in with fewer larger positions. SL below the 161 fib. Only a 50-80 pip SL for a move that eventually ended up being about 500 pips. Of course, all in hindsight and likely would have taken some profits off the table on the way up, but a pretty good RR nonetheless.

I will be updating the first post later tonight to discuss profit taking strategies. In the meantime feel free to post any set ups or ask any questions that you might have. No question is too infantile, we are all hear to learn from each other.

Great stuff Expo, looking forward to it!   
  
In order to give people a taste of what's to come, here is a pattern I caught and traded today, gained almost 5x my risk! Not a 100% perfect one due to the many bounces at the 4th point, but still very trade-able in my opinion.   
  
Sorry if the chart looks clogged up with lines, they are all important as you will soon learn from Expo.  
  
Take care.

Nicely spotted mate!  
  
I see the ABCD completion landed right on the 161fib. A SL just below the 200 fib of 10-12 pips would have been more than sufficient, especially on the 15min TF . Bagged 80 pips, now thats a nice RR!!!

Haha thanks buddy, it was quite a trade! Wasn't as brave as you would have been tho, used a 16 pip stoploss. But just look at that reversal, almost on the pip!! Love Wolfe Waves a lot at the moment ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
Thinking about always closing my position at 1:4RR, that seems to have worked well in the past... Looking forward to hear about your TP strategies ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Remember, we aren't trying to move mountains here, or predict some great shift in sentiment, or predict what some OPEC mouthpiece is going to say or do. All we are doing is preparing the playing field in advance so that when the time comes, we will be ready to take action. Not only will we be ready to take action, we'll know exactly where to take the action. So go ahead and **MAP IT OUT!!**

This chart is self explanatory. All of our levels are right in front of our eyes. Previous S/R tells us that there is likely going to be a battle in the sweet zone. We can see the whole field now. All we have to do now is monitor price action and wait for the moment to strike. Price may never actually make it to the sweet zone, or the wave structure might become invalid. In either case, so be it. We just scrap the plan and look to map out other developing waves.   
  
The above set up is very simple. Risking 12-15 pips to conservatively bag about 40 pips.

I wouldn't say definitively that WWs are better, but they are certainly less complex. I am a true believer in all harmonic patterns. I just gravitated towards the WWs because of the simplicity. I got tired of being "mediocre" at many things and started to focus on being very good at one thing.  
  
I'd say 80% of my trades are WWs. I always have about 20% set aside for long term trades (3-12 months) based on some fundamental scenario.

Hi Expo33, thank you for sharing and to let me discover the Wolfe Waves ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
found below your previous chart as sample, i would like to know how did you choose your exact entry until you got some reaction on your predict reversal point, engulfing, break of a previous S/R ? you could also found on my UJ sample an idea for entry with the break of a TL above CD.  
Please also found a sample on 5m chart on UJ, do you this analyse correct ? one more time i just discover your thread and the wolfe waves ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)

If I understand your first question correctly, I will enter the trade without waiting to see if there is any reversal. I'm assuming in advance, based on the WW structure, AB=CD completion, and the previous S/R that there WILL be a reaction at the price I have marked.  
  
I know most traders would rather wait to see a reversal get started. Many times price will bounce off the preset level then retest that level. If I wait for price to bounce 10 pips now my SL will have to be 20 pips. If price eventually break through and continues higher, I have basically doubled my loss. I'd rather enter first with the 10 pip SL rather than wait for any confirmation. In essence, for me, the conformation IS the Wolfe wave itself coupled with all of the other layers of confluence.  
  
Im not sure if that answers your question.  
  
The UJ set up is not a valid WW because line XB does not converge with line AC (refer to the diagram posted on page one). Even if it was, I would rather stay away from that potential set up anyways. Terrible symmetry, large re trace before leg D completes, just doesn't fit any of the valid WW structure  
  
Anyways, thanks for the post.  
  
A little friendly advice. That PVSRA chart and system is a work of art. I have read thru a lot of Cigarguy's posts, excellent trader with a great system. But for our purposes here, it is best to start with a naked chart. The only thing on my chart initially is the price and the zigzag. Then just map it out. After enough practice you'll see right away that a certain pattern doesn't fit the WW structure

Thank you for answer, ok i understand your entry now, to catch better RR with tight stop loss which sound good as for a scalper !  
Arf i missed the point of XB and AC have to converge read to quickly, my bad. For pvsra i effectively just scalping CigarGuy system and i'm still looking to improve with other compatible system that wave wolfe seems to be, i will follow your advice and open a second naked chart with just the zigzag on higher TF,probably m15, to try to learn wave wolfe, thank you for advice, subscribed ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

For pvsra i effectively just scalping CigarGuy system and i'm still looking to improve with other compatible system that wave wolfe seems to be, i will follow your advice and open a second naked chart with just the zigzag on higher TF,probably m15, to try to learn wave wolfe, thank you for advice, subscribed ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Expo or anybody. Help me pls. Since I am new and haven't read yet the full description of WW. Here is 4 hrs GBPNZD chart.  
  
1\. Is this Bullish or Bearish Wave?  
2\. Do I long or short?  
3\. Where is my point of entry?  
4\. Where is my TP and SL.?  
  
Thank you.

In order to get better at understanding of what works, it's important to look at what doesn't work.  
  
**Three reasons NOT to take this trade**  
  
**1) No symmetry at all**  
**2) No previous S/R confluence**  
**3) AB=CD completion with no FIB confluence**  
  
Right off the bat you can see AB moves 124 pips in 2 candles while CD just plods along actually bouncing off the trend line for like 50 candles to make it's 124 pips to completion. When it reaches completion, you see a little congestion, then ultimately price breaks thru 50 pips higher, far to much for a SL on 30 minutes.  
  
In addition, just look at how the zig zag is moving. Its all over the place. There is nothing harmonic about the price action on the entire chart.

It would be helpful if you at least point an "X" on your chart to show where the wave starts.  
  
The first GN chart is not a valid WW. I'm not even sure what is going on there.  
  
The second EU chart was valid to start but price never reached the XB trend line or sweet zone so point D never happened. As it stands, it ended up being a double bottom. Also, you didn't draw XB properly. You cant draw your trend line form X and cut thru price at B. It is imperative that you are diligent and draw your lines from low point to low point exactly.  
  
With all due respect, I would suggest you go back and look at the Classic Wolfe wave diagram on post #1 and then look at all of the valid examples here that have been posted. You'll need to train your mind to see the patterns and then draw them correctly. Trading is hard my friend. We can't teach you to run if you aren't willing to walk

It seems WW is used to expect a reversal bid. A lot of price patterns, wave patterns are used for reversal trade.   
  
What is successful rate for WW set up?   
  
Is this WW a similar to 3 drive pattern?

hi, good thread. thought may add 10c worth... as i have been using the classic 1-6 pattern for a couple of years now as part of the toolkit. They are very powerful, and WW help ascertain which swing you are trading, which is of upmost importance. Just take your time if your new, make sure you dont imagine things, found them to be never really textbook perfect, double, triple, tops and bottoms, timeframes etc... sometimes you might not see them until after the fact.. experience !

I don't think the two videos you uploaded are covering the same WWs as we are looking to trade here, most of the ones in the videos doesn't have symmetry between AB and CD nor do they have converging trendlines.

If you want to be profitable with these patterns you need to map it out and read the first post in order to understand how they work. The pattern you uploaded is not a valid one as the 1-3 trendline doesn't touch the tip of point 3.

It is a good setup, unfortunately price didn't quite reach the "sweet zone" and by that we didn't get an entry. The sweet zone is where I have marked the green square on my chart. It is the area where the fibonacci extension, 2-4 trendline and ABCD pattern come together.  
  
Still, nice work, and welcome to the forum! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Hi Wayfarer. That is not an indicator, it is just a drawingtool that is available at tradingview.com. It's basically just 2 squares (one red and one green) that makes you visualize the stop and tp ratio.

Hallo Krossaren96  
Thanks. You are right, the wave didn’t make a sweet zone. On the next two charts which I sent, the sweet zones are clear.

Hi Jack.  
  
I couldn't really give you a success rate as that really depends on the person and their ability to find the best set ups. What I can say is that the WW strategy gives the "edge" that we need to be successful in this business.  
  
The 3 drive pattern is a different animal in my opinion mainly because their are no trend line breaks. It's more like trading channels. The WW pattern theory is based on the fact that the "physics" of the wave is out of balance at the trend line break and that their will be an equal an opposite reaction to re-balance the larger wave or system if you will.

This is a great trade and one that I made as well.  
  
One thing I will mention. I haven't taken Bill Wolfe's course but when I read his basic pdf overview, he states that he doesn't always use the "estimated time of arrival". And that makes sense because many of the waves have very flat angles so the convergence point could be 3 months away. Still, it is a nice spot to have marked out  
  
Thanks for your charts, looking good, keep up the good work!

I see the sweet zone you have drawn and it looks good but price didn't quite reach it. If it had we would have gotten an entry. Good job! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Thanks. I have seen some flat waves from historical charts. I am new trader and have problem to spot them in real chart. Even I am not sure how to put my target in these situations. At a moment, I am exercising my eyes to spot wolf waves with triangular shapes in real forex market. My knowledge regarding Wolf-Wave is a peanut. Just I have read the 46-page PDF document. This what I could find to read in the internet unfortunately. I am pretty surprise why this trading method hat less attention by experienced traders, even wolf doesn’t write any textbook for the novice traders. Thus far, this forum is the only forum I have discovered in internet, that is what I joined you to learn more.

It's important to remember that the AB=CD doesn't have to necessarily complete to validate an entry. I map it out just to know where it is, and to see if it is going to show confluence with the structure as a whole. In fact, It may be in Bill Wolfe's course but he never mentioned it in the pdf overview. Also, I have never seen anyone else mention the AB=CD as an entry requirement, it was just something I added as a potential filter.  
  
If you look at that daily CHF/JPY set up it shows very nice symmetry. AB = 7 CANDLES CD = 6 CANDLES.  
For price to have reached the completion on candle 7, 8 or even 9, it would have had to entirely break through the bottom extension line XB of the sweet zone, which to my mind would invalidate the structure. Like I said, this is still a work in progress and these are excellent talking points. Also, this IS the daily so it is reasonable to expect that the AB=CD won't be exact. This trade is very similar to the NU daily I posted (post#3).  
  
On the flip side, this is a good scenario for our earlier discussion about entering after the reversal. In hindsight of course, but entering after the reversal on the TDI cross would have worked out well. Again, the AB=CD was put in place to try and mitigate risk. In this case, based on the price hitting XB, in would be acceptable to scale in at the 161FIB (which happens to be near the testing of the 200EMA). A quick look at Bollinger bands shows price had pierced the bottom level as well. We certainly dont want to force any trade but in this instance there may have been other factors to consider other than ABCD.  
  
Just my rant, off to the movies, back tonight

Hi Expo33  
  
A big thank you for starting this thread.  
  
Do you ever use the fib ratios for AB=CD completion? For example, if AB retraces 61.8 then completion is 161 extension etc.....also I don't recall any time or pip distance being mentioned in Scott carney's material on AB=CD, maybe you can elaborate on this and also on what has to happen for the structure to invalidate. You posted a developing GbpJpy 1hr chart last week somewhere but it kinda fizzled out i think, maybe use that as example to show if still valid or not.  
  
Once again thanks for all your efforts.

Great response, I love how much effort you put into explaining every little detail. So basically the structure, meaning that the AB=CD in terms of time, is more important than price hitting to the exact pip?  
  
I thought that we wanted all of those details - 1-4 line extension, fib and AB=CD to line up in order to take a trade? But we are okay only if two of them line up? Or it's a matter of "feeling" that us WW beginners haven't quite gotten the hang of yet? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Hi. Manually. Using 2 Triangles and 1 line. First, I study the form of WW. Then practice by drawing on paper. Then I look into charts and find them.  
  
Once you can identify a WW on charts. Then the rest is easy and fun.  
  
I find my first WW after 24 hours of study.

> Hi Expo33 A big thank you for starting this thread. Do you ever use the fib ratios for AB=CD completion? For example, if AB retraces 61.8 then completion is 161 extension etc.....also I don't recall any time or pip distance being mentioned in Scott carney's material on AB=CD, maybe you can elaborate on this and also on what has to happen for the structure to invalidate. You posted a developing GbpJpy 1hr chart last week somewhere but it kinda fizzled out i think, maybe use that as example to show if still valid or not. Once again thanks for all...

You're welcome Omi.  
  
To your first question, no I haven't actively considered anything like that, but like I have said, this is still a work in progress. The possibilities are only limited by our imagination. One of the reasons I fell in love with WWs is their simplicity, so for now I am focused on honing my WW skills. However, I am huge fan of Scott Carney's work and have looked at more harmonic structures than my brain can handle.   
  
The GPY/JPY you mentioned totally broke down be fore D. No problem, we just scrub that chart and look for more developing D legs. Map it out, monitor price action, be prepared to strike. Rinse and repeat.  
  
Here is the chart you were talking about. Price breaks down badly. BUT, if you redraw the AC trend line as it stands now, the structure is still technically a valid WW. However, the symmetry is a complete train wreck and not something I would look to trade even if price made it to D  
  
GPY/JPY HOURLY

So basically the structure, meaning that the AB=CD in terms of time, is more important than price hitting to the exact pip? I thought that we wanted all of those details - 1-4 line extension, fib and AB=CD to line up in order to take a trade? But we are okay only if two of them line up? Or it's a matter of "feeling" that us WW beginners haven't quite gotten the hang of yet? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1) Take care and enjoy the movie!

Not really a feeling, more of a mechanics thing.  
  
The definitive characteristic of this wave is how flat it is. Notice XB is almost horizontal and given that AB was a swift and smooth 7 candle move it negates any possibility of CD completing with symmetry inside the sweet zone. The only way CD can complete is to slowly ride down the extension line, in which case there could be no symmetry with AB.  
  
Basically we are on the verge of the a parallel Wolfe wave (PWW), which I intentionally left out for now just because it brings in a whole other set of entry strategies. Honestly, I am still studying the PWWs. Hopefully later on that is something we can get into, but for now just trying to master the classic wave.  
  
Remember, mechanically speaking the sweet zone is anywhere from the XB trend line to the AC parallel extension line. Entry strategies are subjective and vary greatly form one trader to the next.

Great example, although I think you have drawn the fibonacci extension wrong. It seems as if you have put the "100" level above point 3(B)? It should be like this. Still the same pattern, good job! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

If you look at the entry (first) post it says:  
  
  
**EXIT STRATEGY**  
  
Every good entry needs a good exit. Below is my mechanical exit strategy ( I like to divide my positions up into 3 equal parts). I use the X, C, and A points as my reference points for exit. It is likely that there will be an increase in price action at these points just based on the nature of S/R. I would actually be setting my TP levels 5-20 pips below these three levels based on the time frame. I am generally very conservative with my TP's. I don't want to set my TP right at the level only to see price reverse significantly without bagging some pips.  
  
**Note:** When price reaches TP #1 just shy of level X, then the SL's for the two remaining positions are moved to BE.  
  
In regards to your specific pattern I would most likely take the final profit at around 1:6RR as the 1-4 line is _very_ steep ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

I usually stick with 15 minutes and up but will do 5 minutes depending on the pair and the time of day. I don't want to get into a trade on the 5 minute TF during low liquidity, especially with some of the more exotic pairs with bigger [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide")

nice if you catch some pips ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1) but are you seeing ab=cd ?! or any symetrie or xb ac convergence ? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)  
We probably need to focus more on the op rules as we are beginners with WW imho.

AB=CD is not 100% necessary for entry. It is always good to know where that level is, especially for waves that have steep angles.  
  
If you are unsure about entry, the completion level is potentially a good spot, especially if there is confluence with previous S/R, fibos, 200EMA, etc  
  
Also, it is important to note that most traders that trade reversal patterns of any kind tend to wait for confirmation and don't enter until a reversal candle has completed. Perfectly acceptable. Entries are subjective and will vary from trader to trader based on their risk tolerance, personality, and trading style.  
  
The one thing that's generally ALWAYS true is that entry takes place inside the "sweet" zone.

You're welcome.  
  
Just refer to the diagram in post #1 and keep practicing, posting., and asking asking questions. Eventually you will recognize the wave with ease. Then you're only challenge will be entry, exit, and of course risk management

I don't see WW in any charts. You should see the rules again. Some rules are important.

Waves #2 and #5 that you posted don't fit any wave we will be studying here.  
  
Waves #1 and #3 do not fit the requirements of a Classic Wolfe wave (CWW), because lines XB and AC don't converge.  
  
Ironically, #1 and #3 are what I call an "Anti" Wolfe wave (AWW) that I kind of made up during my study period. In my first post I mentioned that we might discuss this type of wave after getting a good grasp on the classic wave. I just didn't want traders to get confused. I would of actually traded your set up as a valid Anti Wolfe wave (AWW).  
  
Three differences that the Anti Wolfe wave exhibit:  
  
1) Lines XB and AC do NOT converge  
2) Price rarely gets to far into the "anti" sweet zone, if you will, just because of the "expanding" nature of the wave.  
3) Because of difference 2, the entry generally takes place very near the AB=CD completion and very near to the parallel extension line.  
  
Wave #4 is actually a Parallel Wolfe wave (PWW) which we haven't discussed yet either. Line XB is horizontal which is what defines the parallel wave  
  
By the way, THANK YOU for using the template and for marking out the points so clearly. It makes the discussion so much easier for everyone involved, especially me.  
  
Cheers  
  
Here is an Anti wave example that I had saved for a discussion at a later date. Note how is looks almost exactly like yours. it also shows a classic wave developing near the TP zone as a good indicator for exit

I'm just not seeing it mate.  
  
I'm glad your banking pips but I just can't see the wave you're trading. Could you at least mark the starting point with an "X"

I redraw it. Here it is. That's the setup I use. I don't know if it's a classic WW or not. But it works ok for me. Yeah, not all pips, but 40 pips TP.  
  
I will extend my TP when I develop confident in WW. Thanks.

XB AND AC don't converge so not a CWW  
  
With all due respect, it would be helpful and less confusing for all who are involved if you would please stick to the CWW. We are trying to master the CWW structure first and foremost.

Not much on the radar yet for this week but i am tracking this one. Pretty flat structure but decent symmetry so far. Myabe London can get this completed for an entry. If not, throw it in the scrap pile and look for others possibilities.

Hi Classy.  
  
I am not sure if you were asking me or "heispark" about the MACD but whatever works as a filter is great. The TDI can be used as a divergence tool as well but whatever traders feel comfortable with.

Hi folks,  
Street Smarts is a book that outlines this patttern, although the authors don't go into the finer points of this strat from the point of view of this thread. I don't trade this pattern because it would usually be something else like a wedge top or bottom for example. However, I saw this and thought I'd post it for you - apologies for the non-conformity to the general template. USDCHF H4

Unfortunately price had broken out of the lower trendline (see my picture), hence no trade. Other than that it was a good setup, good job ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Hi Sailingboat.  
  
Please read the first post of the thread and mark out the sweetzone on your charts using the projected A-C line, the fibonacci expansion and the ABCD pattern, thanks!

Well spotted!  
  
I have the same trade. I actually was looking at the weekly and waited over 6 weeks for it to hit the sweet zone!! Patience paying off nicely though

I wouldn't worry too much about the ETA. In fact, Bill Wolfe himself stated that he doesn't base his exits on the ETA. AS you say, sometimes the wave angle makes the ETA a little unrealistic

First let me preface by stating that I took Bill Wolfe's course,  
was trained by him in the methodology, and have corresponded  
with him regarding setups. I do not mean to rain on anyone's   
parade, but many of the charts being offered here as Wolfe Waves  
are the farthest thing from them. If the "Street Smarts" book, or  
a knock-off website is your only exposure to this setup, then it is  
very unlikely that you are trading Wolfe Waves properly. And over   
the long haul, your results will bear this out.

I think we have alerted any posters that have posted charts that don't meet the requirements of the basic Wolfe wave structure. This is a thread for anyone, so stands to reason there will be a lot of confusion for anyone new to WWs

what about the previous wolfe wave here? Was it a good setup? The only problem is where do we enter? On the touch of 1.41 or 1.61? Or wait for tdi cross, wait for reversal bars confirmation?

So, in the interests of open discussion and education, what would you say are the problems with the Wolf Waves being shown here and the real deal? I'm sure everyone viewing this thread would be most interested in whatever constructive input you can provide.

Conventional wisdom says wait for the TDI cross then put your stop above the original price spike. I do that sometimes, but usually I am entering as price hits my predetermined zone.  
  
I am trying to get more bang for my buck out of the entry (closer to the ultimate spike). In this case price only advanced 11 pips past the AB=CD level, not bad for an hourly set up. Waiting for the TDI cross is fine, you'll just have to decide if you want your SL to be above the last printed candle or much higher above the original price spike, which in the is case over 20 pips.  
  
Once you get more confidence in the structure and set up, you will start to get more comfortable with the entry. A lot depends on your risk management profile. Either way, its important to know what SL level is going to give your trade reasonable breathing room without exposing yourself to too much risk.

True. Right now, i am just using 1:1 for my wolfe wave entries. I found out that the EPA is not always accurate like the one audcad 1hour setup. It was good for when the AC trendline touches back but not until the EPA. Anyway, i'm satisfied if every setup can get the price go to AC or line 24.

In my opinion, you're using the wrong starting point for "X"  
  
Refer to the chart below. A very nice set up with excellent symmetry. Trade would have been triggered with an 8 pip bounce down from entry. That is exactly what we are looking for. This gives us the option of moving the SL to BE for a free trade. Either nothing or 20-25 pips in the green. I like that option. Of course, you can always leave the initial SL in place and ride it out.

I don't use the EPA. I don't think many traders do.  
  
On smaller time frames I am trying to get my TP at least back to level C. That will give me at least 2:1 RR. On higher time frames I tend to scale out along the way as the diagram shows in post #1.  
  
Working a demo acct on this is a great way to see what works. You just have to be diligent in sticking to a risk management profile to make it a better simulation to real money trades. Of course, nothing can simulate the emotions of live trading

it's actually quite a nice setup. My original stoploss was 12 pips but i got impatient and got out at +11. Good luck guys for those who are still in.

that's nice. What was your original stoploss for this trade? Around 200 maybe? How many pips for stoploss? I saw you entered at 1.41. Did you wait for reversals or you just put a limit order there?

Stop loss was a few pips above the 200, then moved down a few pips above the spike level after the trade was going in my favor.  
  
Smaller time frames I almost never wait for the reversal candle. I entered right at the AB=CD 141FIB

Thanks brother.  
  
That UJ trade was 24 pips green at level C and I didn't micro manage, now back in the red. Remember what we were talking about. Now I want to break my computer screen but I can't because my daughter is sleeping, lol  
  
Point being I was at 2:1 at the 24 pip level so that should be enough. At least take half off and move SL to BE. Feels like a wasted set up now. Gotta be on your A game in this biz

Haha Yeah I know. I closed it at BE actually. I just feel that if we micromanage we won't get very much per trade mate! But you should really do what you feel is best for you, I might test it as well.  
  
Did the USDCHF hit SL for you too?

Explosive pair, nice! Really moving now!

For us who use TDI as entry, moving stoploss to BE at B is too soon, do you have other micromanaging levels that work good? Or we should only use the C and A?

Yes it did, same thing. I didn't take anything off the table as it was green but not that green yet. Still, for me if I'm green 10-15 pips on a smaller time frame, it is best to take some profit, move SL to BE.  
  
Remember, smaller time frames, these aren't some monumental shift in fundamentals, just a re-balancing of the physics of price, for the lack of a better term

On the image you posted there isn't really an X-leg. Remember that the X must be located on the lower trendline!

I think that will vary from trader to trader. For me, a lot depends on the pair and the time frame. As an example, on that EUR/NZD trade point B is already about 30 pips whereas on less volatile pairs point B may only be 10 pips. Plus, the angle of the structure dictates how many pips each level will be

I see, I will most likely just divide the area from X to entry in 3 equal parts and put some profit at each one of them, see picture (green lines) ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Sorry, I was lazy and didn't mark it out. Yes it is, but still the B leg is above the X.

Yup, that's a work of art right there, beautiful. As I stated in the beginning, Wolfe waves are often the end points of larger harmonic structures.

No I haven't. On bigger time frames the trade could be back to BE by the time the cross happens anyways. Just look at my AUD/CAD trade as it reverses here for a bit. trade might even be in the red when TDI crosses back

Using this strategy must be great in a trend. Look at the chart below. The blue lines show an outzoomed wolfe wave. Look at the big bearish trend continuing right when the pattern hits the sweet zone. Thinking about only trading them in line with the higher timeframe's trend... That way we can aim for a much higher RR.  
  
Update: Added the second chart as one more example. USDJPY trade from last friday. We would already be in about 1:5 (and that is when using the TDI cross when entering!), aiming for about 1:8 due to previous structure.  
  
Update 2: One more. The EURNZD chart I uploaded a couple of hours ago. Will move my stops to BE after 1:2 RR has been hit and then let the whole position run. I think we get more than enough setups to filter them using trend. Just 1 trade per day is more than enough.

Absolutely. The possibilities are only limited by our imaginations.  
  
You can also use the TDI green as a divergence tool. Notice the hidden divergence on that GBP/USD set up. Would have been a nice filter for some extra confidence for the entry.

Great input! Yeah that would have given us some confluence on the higher timeframe as well which is always good. Also, trading with the trend is a great situation to take partial profits in.  
  
Loving this thread, keep up the good work everyone!  
  
There was TDI confluence on my EURNZD trade as well! Also big pinbar only 1.5 hours from printing, good days.  
  
Edit: Can we only use the green TDI line for divergence? If so, why?

Hi,  
  
Great thread. Keep on alive.  
  
Just a question. Do you use standard setting for the ZIGZAGPIPS indicator? I put your template on GBPJPY daily chart and doesn't appears the last wave lines...  
  
  
thank you

Thank you Toni.  
  
You can change the input setting on the "Extdepth" to show smaller waves. Sometimes you can't get the exact waves. In that case I just draw them manually and calculate the ABCD manually as well.  
  
I had "Extdepth" on 3 for that chart  
  
Cheers

As I understand it, the TDI green is basically the same as the RSI on setting 13. See chart below for comparison

Awesome thread guys. I have been following for a couple of days, but just signed up to participate.  
  
I have a question though. Do price have to enter the sweet zone in order to present an entry? What if price bounces on the top of the sweet zone?  
  
For instance in the setup attached below. Btw, please do tell if the setup is off.

Expo33,  
  
Would you give me a synopsis of the process you go through finding you WW setups.  
Do you have multiple charts open on you MT4? Do you start with one time frame  
and move to a larger or smaller time frame based on what you observe? How many  
pairs do you concentrate on? Periodically do you open up each chart to observe the  
potential WW formation? I know I have asked alot. I am just trying to get an  
understanding how to find the setups. Thank you.

Edit: Sorry, I missed that you wanted Expo's way of finding them. Feel free to read mine below!  
  
Sure. If using the uploaded ZigZag indicator, the first step is to look for channel-like structures with converging trendlines (looking like the drawn images in the first post). If you find them, see if they fit the rules in the first post (for instance for a bearish setup the lower trendline needs to be steeper). Then map out the b-c line, fibonacci extension and the ABCD pattern to find the sweetzone. It's all in the first post.  
  
The timeframe doesn't matter, we are only learning the pattern here. When finding the pattern we do not need to have multiple charts open either. I have two lists of pairs that I get lower spread on from my broker, and so they are better when trading 5-15 min patterns. For 30-min plus I scan almost all pairs (with all I mean the major crosses, it's about 20). I do this when I have time, about 2-4 times a day. It only takes a couple of minutes.  
  
When we have found the setups we can start look at other things to filter them. We can look at different timeframes, RSI, divergence, trend, pretty much anything that gives us better confidence in the setup. Google "Forex Confluence" if you are not sure what I am talking about.  
  
When I have found a proper setup I set an alarm just above the sweetzone so that I don't have to watch the pair every minute.  
  
That's about it, good luck ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Edit: The way we want to trade the Wolfe Wave here is that the trade is not valid until we hit the Sweet zone. Just the Wolfe Wave is valid as long as the D breaks outside of the X-B trendline.  
  
A WW is not really valid until we hit the sweet zone. If this zone is hit, it can only invalidate by moving too far from the wave (channel), hitting the stoploss (This means that it was more of a breakout than a fakeout).  
  
If you mean before the sweetzone is hit, anything that invalidates the structure is invalidating the wave, for instance if price takes too long from wave A to B, or from C to D (meaning that there is no symmetry in the AB=CD pattern), if price is generally whipsawing so no clear wave can be seen (remember to not force the setups) or if it breaks any of the trendlines (an example is in the picture below.)  
  
Take care!

Do you mean that the WW ist not valid till the price reaches the sweet zone? What about if the price touches the BD-Line somewhere without reaching the sweet zone?

Hi Dublo,  
  
If price bounces before entering the sweet zone it is still a valid Wolfe wave. You could enter on the TDI cross.  
  
You're set up is perfect with nice symmetry too!

Hell Expo33, just referring your first post WWs with extremely steep angles tend to reverse at the 200 to 261 fib extensions  
This one looks like very steep. What do you think? Is it wise to wait till the price reachs fib200?

Any pair and any time frame from 5 minutes to weekly.  
  
Every day I start fresh. The only charts I leave up from the previous day are those that are still valid Wolfe waves that are still developing in the D leg.  
  
I start with the majors and work my way through the list. A quick glance at the higher time frames and on down through the lower time frames. Since I do this every day I usually can skip many of the higher time frames because I already know there isn't any potential set up.   
  
Generally speaking throughout the day you will be looking for hourly, 30 minute, 15 minute, and 5 minute set ups. The 4H and up set ups take so much longer you just need to map it once and monitor t for days or possibly weeks.  
  
A good exercise is to pull up any pair and scroll thru a lower time frame as far back as you can and look for WWs and map them out. Just to see where the reversal happened and what the final result was.  
  
Feel free to post any set ups you think are valid and we would be happy to check them out for you.  
  
Cheers

Nice chart mate.  
  
Actually the wave doesn't have to enter the sweet zone to be valid. Here is a chart from Bill Wolfe's web site showing CWW that doesn't actually enter the sweet. straight from the founder himself![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

The AB=CD is right there at 79.26 I would either be in now with SL below the 200FIB, or since liquidity is very low this time of day you could monitor and wait for a TDI cross on the 30 minute time frame.  
  
My spread on [Oanda](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile") at the moment is 10 pips. Every day at around 2pm PST in the US [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") on minor pairs is pretty big for 30 minutes or so. I don't know how it is with your broker, but something to consider.

Thanks, Expor33. I enjoy this forum. Things start to bee clear slowly. Especially combing WW with Fib. I appreciate your great effort to make this tread very active. I would like also to thank **Krossaren96** for his excellent Kontribution.

I stand corrected, I added this line to my post: Edit: The way we want to trade the Wolfe Wave here is that the trade is not valid until we hit the Sweet zone. Just the Wolfe Wave is valid as long as the D breaks outside of the X-B trendline.  
  
So future readers don't get confused.

A setup looking good: The 30-min NZDUSD chart that was shared by CrocodileRex, having nice trendline confluence, divergence and uptrend on the daily. I'm Long if the TDI crosses up on the 30-min!

He sometimes changes the settings to fit the waves better. Try changing the ExtDepth setting to different values and see if you find the correct one. If that doesn't work I am sure he will answer as soon as he comes back online.

Hi Mate.  
  
Maybe your "extdepth" is set at 3 or 6. Mine is set at 12. I change that setting around to see if I can get it to line up with the waves I am mapping. Sometimes though, you can't get it to match perfectly so I just draw the waves manually and figure out the pip movement manually as well to find the AB=CD completion level.  
  
For my chart this is what it is set at. Hope that helps

You can play around with that setting. Try 3,6,12,18,24 and see how the waves change just to get a feel for it

Non WW related, I actually have a long term position from .6690-50 based on this important level and some other fundamentals.....and the infamous Quasimodo pattern (seriously, forex traders can't make up enough patterns!)  
  
Hope we get a recovery here, a break below could get ugly! A break here would open up the door back down to .6680-60 area

Hello friend and thank you for using the template.  
  
I'm sorry I must have missed your post. For that chart under "inputs" I had the "exdepth" setting on 6. I think the default is set at 12 so it isn't showing the smaller waves. I change that setting to try and fit the zigzag to the waves I am mapping, like 3,6,12,18,24   
  
Hope that helps  
  
Cheers

Not a WW mate  
  
B has to be lower than X, and C would be lower than A. This would be a bullish set up so the wave would have to be descending, lower lows, lower highs  
  
Keep referring to the diagram in post #1 and keep practicing, eventually it will be like riding a bike, you'll know it instinctively

Expo33 could you have a look on this example - GY M30, what do you think you will do, will you buy D @161,80 % fibo outside the sweet zone or @ 200% fibo on a previous Support look left, or both or none ?!!  
Could also found a tdi divergence @ both 16.8 and 200% fibo

This is almost a parallel wave, XB is nearly horizontal. Difficult to trade especially with this volatile pair. Hard to say in hindsight if I would have traded this, but if I did I would have been in from 127 to 141 and would have been stopped out.

It has already happened but I want to make sure I understood it correctly. Also where do you place your SL, and is the TP a bit too steap in my chart?

Looks perfect. I would put the SL maybe 10 pips above the 161FIB. Considering you are targeting what looks like nearly 100 pips, a SL of 20 pips would be plenty of breathing room for this trade and a very nice RR. Always can scale out a little if things change as price moves down.  
  
The wave itself looks a bit rough with the price chop but what I like is the symmetry of time and length. For example, XA and BC similar length and time, also AB and CD very similar length and time.  
  
Thanks for posting, looks like your right on target here. Also thank you for using the template and marking everything out. Also showing the time frame, date, and price is awesome so I can find the wave on my platform easier.  
  
Cheers

my nzd/usd took profit for half position and the other half stopped out at b/e. Still don't know how to manage the positions here.  
  
Am in at aud/chf also but didn't look so good. Stoploss was almost reached. We'll see.  
  
u/cad was nice expo33. I didn't manage to catch it. Please post next time if you see any setup yeah?

Good move on the Kiwi trade. I did the same. These trades sometimes are like scalps. A nice 20 pip bounce, take some profit, move SL to BE and then hope for the home run to the target line.  
  
Same deal on AUD/CHF. Weathered the initial momentum past the AB=CD level. Just looking for that 20 pip bounce then micro management.  
  
Yea I had the UCAD all mapped out but got tied up on the phone. Then my 5 year old woke up and needed daddy time so I never got it posted before it triggered.  
  
Anyways, I think you're managing very well, kind of the same thought process I have. Very conservative. We don't need a home run every time to make this business become very lucrative. For me 30 pips a day is more than enough.

Missed this eur/nzd trade. To the pip short at 1.27. Good for 35-40 pips. I found out that taking the first retrace at 1.27 or 1.41 is usually best. Like the u/cad trade right now. Would not short anymore since the pair moved more than 10pips already.  
  
It's easier to see in hindsight though.

That one is closer to an AWW (anti Wolfe wave) which we haven't really gotten into yet. Looks like XB and AC are a degree or 2 from converging so a slightly expanding wave, still works well though.  
  
Same principle but the sweet zone in reverse sort of speak. Entry is usually right at the parallel extension line or a little bit past it and it usually falls on the 113 or 127 just because the nature of the expanding wave structure

so, anti wolfe wave is basically XB and AC converging in a very small degree? I mean, if you drag it out to monthly timeframe, they do converge eventually. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
I see not much difference there as long as X is in the middle of B and C, i think it's a go? I am actually more focused on the fibo ratio of 1.27 ti 1.61.

Then my 5 year old woke up and needed daddy time so I never got it posted before it triggered. Anyways, I think you're managing very well, kind of the same...

Not completely agree with this, will try to explain with my poor English, drawing complex tool like ab=cd to catch 10-20% of the move is a little bit pity imho, that also mean that your 30 pips profit are with larger lot (with or without leverage) but it require perfect entries that is difficult with the sweet zone, also with this kind of strategy your R:R is becoming in the best case at 1:1 and will loose the benefit of ab=cd, you will in this case found better scalping system that will give you 30 pips /day stress free.  
  
But may be we could have the best of the 2 world ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60d.png?v=15.1) as crocodileRex mentioned previously a difficult part is to manage the trade, since we enter short at for example 161.80% we already know that first support we will found are xb line, later B horizontal line X level etc....  
My idea is when i enter on fibo % i already prepare to tp may be 80% +be at xb line if price reacted as reversal what about using a sell stop 2 pips below this new Low ? the stop loss will be also differents than the 1st trade because we have new Lower High. This could be repeat to the next support level B, hope i was clear, will join a charts with description if you are interested, just my 2cents. 

There is no way to happiness , happiness is the way.

I mean, if you drag it out to monthly timeframe, they do converge eventually. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) I see not much difference there as long as X is in the middle of B and C, i think it's a go?

Same structure as far as higher highs, higher lows as in the examples I posted except on the Anti Wolfe wave XB and AC NEVER converge. Look at the examples I posted, XB is the red line at the top

All we are doing is taking partial profits and moving SL to BE for the rest of the positions. Over time averaging in trades that make the target line the risk reward is much higher than 1:1  
  
TP strategy and RR scenarios vary from trader to trader depending on your risk profile, acct size, etc etc  
  
In that Kiwi trade we take 20 pips on 1/3 to 1/2 of our position. If we didn't, we incur the full loss of all positions as the trade reversed and moved below our initial SLs.  
  
If finding stress free scalp systems that made 30 pips easy a day then we'd all be able to start with a 2k acct and be millionaires in a couple of years  
  
But hey, you have to do what works for you

Perfect! I like your SL and target too.  
  
Just a thought. The AB=CD completion is about 5 pips short of the 161FIB. Higher time frames especially, I would break my total risk amount up and scale in with 3 positions starting at the 141FIB and ending at the 161FIB, kind of like dollar cost averaging. There is about 20 pips between those two levels so every 6 or 7 pips another position. Gives you a better total buy in price and lessens your risk. The down side is price may reverse before the 161FIB and your total position would be smaller. If the trade ended up a winner, then you'd make less

Shorted this 1-min wolfe wave a couple of minutes ago, currently at 1:1 RR. Stoploss is on the chart and reward is at 1:10RR. The trend on the GBPUSD is very bearish, hence the big RR. 5 pips stoploss, 50 tp, let's hope it works ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1) The 1-min is not my favorite timeframe but as hitting a 1:10RR on a 30-min chart or higher will take days or even weeks I am looking to get more familiar with the lowest timeframes.  
  
I would love it if you guys could upload any wolfe waves (that haven't completed yet) that you find on the 1-15 min chart as I am going to do some statistics on these patterns on the low timeframes and it will be faster if I get some help. Thanks!

It's good except for the part that the trendlines need to be going in the same direction. So the lower trendline should face downwards! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

XB line being flat is the parallel Wolfe wave (PWW) from post #1 that we haven't discussed yet. I have been studying these working on entry strategies.

Here is a basic overview of the TDI

![File Type: pdf](https://assets.faireconomy.media/images/attach/pdf.gif) [The TDI indicator - overview and settings.fxdaytrader.pdf](/attachment/file/2220335?d=1489018218) 68 KB | 878 downloads 

  
Here is a little more in depth explanation of each element. Starts on page 32  
[http://www.forexmt4.com/_MT4_Systems...mics/TDI_1.pdf](http://www.forexmt4.com/_MT4_Systems/Traders%20Dynamics/TDI_1.pdf)  
  
For the TDI anglelator on the bottom right, it basically tells you the trend for each tine frame as well as the RSI conditions and a little bit more. I suggest you take a look at the inputs, it is somewhat self explanatory. For example, why the different colors for each number. It relates to how oversold or overbought price is on that particular time frame. Just scroll through the inputs and it will become clearer.  
  
Hope that helps

You're welcome. I should probably update post #1 with this info.   
  
Also the second line with the different dot colors is related to the TDI separation strength

was tracking this one also but didn't manage to short it. Was good for 15-25 pips. I was thinking of starting a group chat for wolfe wave discussion so that i won't miss future setups like this. Already pmed you regarding this expo.  
  
Anyone interested in communicating via whatspp? It's faster and real time.

Yea I moved my SL to BE and got stopped out.  
  
I need to find some bigger time frame set ups where I can just set and let it go for awhile.

I have been looking at most setups here during these few days and noticed that they were mostly good for 10-20 pips depending on currency volatility.  
  
What i do now is to set a fixed stoploss for certain pairs. E.G, eur/usd i would set a fixed 10 pips stoploss and take profit. For more volatile pairs like eur/jpy, i would maybe set a 11-12 pips stoploss depending on the fibs.  
  
I think this is much better than targeting the EPA line.  
  
Just my 2 cents.  
  
here's one setup forming for aud/cad. 11 pips sl and tp.

Completely agree.  
  
The smaller time frames especially are more like scalps. I am happy to make 30 pips a day.

Too bad it turned at 1.41. Again, good for 20 pips if you entered at 1.41. Did you manage to get in?

Ugh, no it missed the first filled position by 3 pips, now it's already headed 30 pips south. A days work missed  
  
My fault, I had a feeling it wouldn't make it all the way there, almost scaled in earlier. Oh well, took some pips from NCAD. Long oil now on my regular trading account so don't want to trade against myself

Any current EWCharts for USD/CAD ? A previous chart was invalidated with the break higher. ADP Employment figures out of the US on Wednesday were highly suspicious to me. I see a big revision coming to this number , wouldn't be the first time.

Glad you only lost 20 pips. Just curious why you'd be down 80 pips on a 15 time frame. My SL was 15 pips or so.  
  
Also, that trade initially was 20 pips in the green. For such a small time frame, I usually move my SLs to BE and take the free trade looking for the home run. Price rarely just blows through the sweet zone without looking back. There is almost always resistance and more often then not a reaction in the zone.   
  
Anyways, I post the trades I'm getting into just as an illustration of how I go about trading the WWs. I hope everyone does their due diligence and develops a strategy that fits their personality and risk profile.  
  
Cheers

I'm assuming you mean Elliot waves? I don't have the knowledge to plot EWs, only Wolfe waves. At the moment, no Wolfe waves in development for UCAD.

Great trade mate! That is the home run trade we dream about. Big time frame, big pips!

Hi, thanks I did try to point it out when I saw the good trade, but my posts get directed to 'manual moderation' to ensure they are fit for consumption! Maybe one has to have x posts (?) before one is trusted...

I let it run. It's ok 20 pips. I have other trades in GU and EU that are profit. In the end, I still end up in green.

USDJPY 15 min, not the best setup due to symmetry but it bounced perfectly off of the 161.8 fib so I'm in when the TDI crosses.

Not sure what your point is, maybe just showing a failed Wolfe wave?  
  
Anyways, we can learn a lot by looking at failed WWs. For instance on this particular WW note:  
  
1) The AB=CD completion level is 13 pips above the previous 2 month high, so taking this trade is potentially trading against a significant breakout level.  
  
2) After the ABCD level was barely hit, if you look at the lower time frame, price initially bounced back down, as it so often does, to about 17 pips in the green. That's why I like to take at least 1/3 of my position off the table in profit and move the SLs to BE for the remaining 2/3's. Gives you a guaranteed small win with the potential for a home run. Otherwise, as was the case here, price reversed back up and blew out the original SLs and you incur the full value loss of the initial trade.  
  
3) From a fundamental perspective, a different animal altogether, commodity prices, especially oil, have been selling off recently so going against that trend (i.e. shorting UCAD) is risky business

Waiting for the TDI cross is a good thing here for sure. Still, you're potentially fighting against the current. Zoom out to the 1HOUR and look at what's going on at 114.94, a significant breakout area. Look where that line is on your 15 minute chart. Bulls will be looking to get long on retest of 114.94, bears getting short on a break below that level. 115.36 the next significant high

I don't really expect this to get filled but nonetheless I wanted to share it. Also, I will scale in a bit early as it is likely there will be major supply as we get into 140.46 area, if we even make it that far  
  
This a really good example of trying to short into the major resistance instead of trying to short after a break of major resistance.

**  
  
I stripped the same chart of everything but the AB=CD completion line and zoomed out on the hourly to show what I meant in my recent posts about major resistance. If the AB=CD completion line is above the major resistance and we are trying to short, then we are really playing with fire. Instead our AB=CD is exactly THE major resistance, so I am scaling in bit early. Also, we know where our SL will be. Clearly as the charts shows, if 140.46 breaks then 140.73 is pretty likely, so we can go smaller position size and bigger SL above 140.73, or what I will do is scale in early and SL will be 140.60 area.  
  
Hopefully the chart illustrates a little better what I'm trying t say

i don't really like this formation here because i think the BC is too steep/short. Good luck anyway. Also, if i were you, i would enter at 1.618 instead of 2.0 there.

Thanks. Yea, the symmetry isn't that pleasant.  
  
This trade is more about the previous S/R. This is the dragon, an explosive pair, so don't want to enter to early. My thinking was scale in 10 pips shy of the AB=CD. Bulls will be targeting 140.73. My soldiers are lined up from 140.36 to completion at 140.46 and are ready to do battle!  
  
All 3 positions are now filled. As the young kids say these days, I say to the dragon....."come at me bro"

Nice. As we say around here, we are only constrained by our imagination. If the tick chart works for you, then have at it and trade safe

Certainly on smaller time frames that is true.  
  
However if we have a 4h or daily set up on leg D, the NFP might just be the catalyst that gets our positions filled. But true also is having no position also a position.

UKX H4 - a setup to stalk. The premise would be a strong rejection of the all time high at a confluence of measured move targets based on higher time frame charts. Indeed, if the move ensues then it could be the start of something much, much bigger....

Looks like it has potential.  
  
Just as a housekeeping detail, this wave doesn't converge so not a "classic" Wolfe wave but fits what I call the "anti" Wolfe wave, fancy way of saying lines XB and AC don't converge.  
  
Thanks for posting, will track this.

Without any comments or explanation, I don't understand your entry strategy. Clearly both are far beyond the AB=CD level. Care to let us in on your strategy?

Here's a nice one i took earlier. Sorry i didn't post the setup earlier. 10 pips to the pip.  
  
This might be a anti wolfe wave as you called it or a very parallel one but well, i gues i am fine with whatever makes me the dough.  
  
Also, for those who are still having a hard time to find the wolfe waves formation, i recommend this pacman setup with two open mouths like the picture. It's easier to spot like this. Draw the remaining lines after.

USDCHF H4 - Maybe. I'm not totally convinced, but then again I detest trading Swissy. What #I would say is that on Thursday 16th, the bears had a sell the close bear trend and the market has not been back to test the close of the bar around 9970 so that would be a magnet in my view and, therefore, ammunition for the case for a bear move at some point....

> Here's a nice one i took earlier. Sorry i didn't post the setup earlier. 10 pips to the pip. This might be a anti wolfe wave as you called it or a very parallel one but well, i gues i am fine with whatever makes me the dough. Also, for those who are still having a hard time to find the wolfe waves formation, i recommend this pacman setup with two open mouths like the picture. It's easier to spot like this. Draw the remaining lines after. {image}

Interesting way of thinking about it! Another way, without having to draw lines is to visualise a stairs type pattern. These patterns generally occur after the strong phase of a trend; when a 'broad channel' has established - it will all depend on your time frame as to what 'broad' means. At any rate, it would be a weaker stage of a trend. So for a weak bull trend / broad bull channel after every high, the bears are shorting and able to make money by taking the market back down below the prior major high. As the bulls get weaker and the bears get stronger, the pullbacks get deeper and that is the harbinger of a bear move as eventually the bulls will run out of steam. So I see that as the driver for the change in trend. The Wolffe wave pattern, for me, is interesting, but I don't actually trade it - it's fun to find the patterns though! The other factors (bull / bear pressure) are what I feel are more important to get a grasp of.

Also, I will scale in a bit early as it is likely there will be major supply as we get into 140.46 area, if we even make it that far This a really good example of trying to short into the major resistance instead of trying to short after a break of major resistance.

After a lackluster week, I finally got the home rune type trade.  
  
I didn't notice it when I posted it, but my this 15 minute GJ WW also had a larger WW on the hourly, both completing nearly to the pip at 140.46. As stated initially, major previous S/R at that level. Loaded up 5 positions total and have taken 80 pips each from the first 3 and will let the last 2 run into next week.  
  
Interesting to note: On the GBP?JPY thread the experts for this pair were focused on the 140.7 as the next resistance but the power of the Wolfe strikes again!

To all of the traders that have stopped by this thread: Thanks for all of the posts this week!  
  
I am going to start a demo on my FxChoice account where all of the trades are exclusively Wolfe wave set ups. Even though only a demo, it would be a good way to track the potential of this strategy, and a good way to build some confidence without risking any real money.  
  
Anyone else interested, maybe give it a try if you want. Demo super hero bragging rights on the line. I'll set one up with 10,000 using 1% max risk per trade (meaning that's the total for all positions for each particular set up) with 200:1 leverage. A good broker to do it with too. They use the New York closing candles and have unlimited demo time.  
  
Have a great weekend everyone!

For instance on this particular WW note: 1) The AB=CD completion level is 13 pips above the previous 2 month high, so taking this trade is potentially trading against a significant breakout level. 2) After the ABCD level was barely hit, if you look at the lower time frame, price initially bounced back down, as it so often does, to about 17 pips in the green. That's why I like to take at least 1/3...

Yes, we can learn if we have a good teacher. Non AB=CD wolfe waves

Yes, AB=CD is not a requirement for WW or for entry. My point was, I didn't see any explanation for your entry point and was curious as to how you decide when you are going to enter the trade. After all, the D leg can go on indefintely

Hope everyone had a nice weekend.  
  
**Just some thoughts going forward:**  
  
1) **Patience** \- It may be cliche, but let the trade come to you. Considering all of the pairs, not to mention all of the smaller time frames, we could easily find 100 WWs in a week. **BUT,** we only need a couple of good trades a week to make consistent pips.  
  
2) **Dangerous trades -** Big news, small time frames, low liquidity. We just have to pass on these WWs  
  
3) **Filters -** When we were kids we knew the guy smoking the non filter Camel cigarette was a rebel. Why? Because we knew it was more dangerous to his health. Same in trading. If we don't have confluence with filters, then we don't have the necessary edge.  
  
Speaking of filters, I spent my extra time this weekend going over about 100 completed WWs. I slapped a pitchfork on the last swing up to the D leg and found this to have great potential as another filter for entry. Especially for steep waves and higher time frames where entry can be difficult. Coupled with our other filters, this could be very powerful.  
  
Cherry picked of course but just to show the idea:

Sorry been away all day. I don't have GOLD/EURO on my platform but what I can say is that XB and AC don't converge so not a classic Wolfe wave. Fits my definition of an anti Wolfe wave (AWW). Looks like it has corrected over 6 months but I can'treally make any reasonable comment other than that.

Sorry out all day. Water under the bridge at this point but not a Wolfe wave as C is not lower than X. Please refer to the diagram on post #1

I think your platform is metatrader, you may register a demo account with any broker([FXPRO](/brokers/fxpro "View FxPro Broker Profile") has the symbol for sure) and see the Gold vs Euro chart. And you may also check it very easily on [www.tradingview.com](http://www.tradingview.com) . it would be do kind of you if you give me some more info.

not an expert here but i think your X is wrong. The X should be at 1400 there making this an invalid wolfe wave.

Just for giggles, here's a possible monthly setup for EURUSD. Suppose it depends on your own view of this currency pair as to whether you think this is likely or not.....maybe just a H&S flag which may lead to continuation

UJ 5min has a few pips left so a pullback may provide a decent entry for some

The A/N wasn't nice actually. If i had pay more attention, i would not entered that trade. There was not enough harmonic pattern on it. Also, i shoulda entered at 2.0 there instead of 1.618.

That's what was bothering me, it was a bit rough around the edges. My gut said do it do it do it, but I decided stick to my plan and not rationalize. There are always other opportunities.

Looks nice. I didn't notice this setup also. Maybe i'm more focusing on the smaller swings. Didnt really zoom out for the big picture.  
  
I noticed you have a higher risk:reward. As you know, i have a 1:1 ratio and for me, this usd/jpy is considered tested as it turned from the sweat zone for about 10-15 pips. I see that you are aiming for around 25 pips profit?  
  
if this hits all your take profit, what is your ratio?

I actually tend to manually manage the trades. I only set the TPs around the standard 2:1 ratio so I don't miss any major spikes when I am away from the screen for longer periods of time (of course I can manage from my phone too but have been really busy lately)  
  
For smaller time frames like this trade, if the trade moves to 1:1 like 15 pips or so, I will take profit on a few positions and let the other 2 run with trailing stop or just move SL to BE. I am definitely conservative on my TPs as a rule. Actually trying to train myself to let the winners run, one of my many weaknesses. But on the flip side as I've mentioned before, these set ups aren't meant to be major reversals, just short term price bounces or as I like to say, temporary price attitude re-adjustments

yea i get what you mean totally. For myself, i can't really seem to be fond of the idea of having many small open positions and let them run. Might be i am very paranoid and can't sleep at night aiming for the long run.  
  
I guess a trader has to find what suits them the best. I am kinda a scalper, fast in, fast out. Better for health too i think. Well, the adrenalin rush during the trade is really something though especially when your stoploss is too small and the spread is sometimes killing you.  
  
Was eating hypertension pills since few years back. Forex must have done alot to my poor body. Too late to get out now though.  
  
oh guys, do meditation. It really helps me to release some stress. it really works.  
  
Also, another thing good about this wolfe wave system is you really can map it out like expo33 said (thanks once again for this thread!). Draw the lines, wait for the price to hit and let it go. It takes patience for a trade to form and i think this system is really changing my habit to a better one. With all other free times, i can use to spend on watching some good movies. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Hi Expo, I was having a look at your setup and I have identified something that may be worth watching out for, but I am no expert - just learning.  
Looking at the higher time frame charts there are various spikes and channels in operation and one such channel started on the 10th. A retrace to the start of that channel would see a move to the higher rectangle shown on the inserted chart. Apologies for all of the other dotted levels, but I have many S&R levels on my H1 charts. The move between 6 and 8am this morning was quite strong (and was also a move from the bottom of a 15min channel to the top) and broke above a prior swing high / pivot at around 11498 and there is still a gap, which could be a measuring gap. The leg leading up to that was 11498-11454=44 points so if that measuring gap stays open (or if there is obvious future support created by that gap), projecting up 44 points from 11498 would give a target of 11542 which is in the region of the channel retrace I referred to earlier. Just my 2 penny worth and something to watch if your Wolfe Wave move doesn't get going. I'm not saying it won't, but just something to bear in mind.

Thanks for the kind words. For me too, I like the mapping and waiting for price to come into the spiders web. Plus this fits my contrarian nature

yes, but i considered that wave gone because price already retraced so much towards the EPA. I consider this as a successful wolfe wave already.  
  
If i were to enter, it would be at 1200.40 but price never made it there so too bad.

Currently looking at back-testing a system for FTSE 100 stocks when I get chance and I came across this, which is possibly relevant for those who can trade UK shares. Apologies if this is not wanted in the thread. If too 'off-topic' just shout.

I took profits before the target line but this one ended up being a text book CWW. AB=CD to the pip, FIB confluence and nice symmetry between AB and CD and also between XA and BC

i was in this one but i chickened out at +6. Because i was heavily leveraged on nzd/usd on a bad trade on another system. I coulda gotten +10 on aud/usd though. I was too drunk and not in a good condition to trade anymore for tonight. Gotta stop now.  
  
I'm telling you expo, this wolfe wave thing is really something here but maybe it is too early to tell. I'll gather more datas as this thread progresses.

Hey Croc a win is a win, good for you. I grabbed it at top because it was moving up pretty fast. Not sure on the pip total, does this total 121 or 12 pips.   
I mostly trade futures, it seems theres many more opportunities in forex.

Nicely done!  
  
I love the bounce factor because it gives you the option to take some profit off the table and/or move the SLs to BE for a free run at the home run target line

Agree, the WW has unlimited potential. I am still studying past and present charts to find some additional filters.  
  
So far I haven't anytime for the screen today so no trades as of yet  
  
Probably won't do anything with US pairs until after the Fed tomorrow.

In my opinion, you did not miss this setup as this is not a valid one.  
  
Notice how AB is not equal to CD. For a good wolfe wave to complete, CD has to be equal or bigger/stronger than AB. Also, the perfect one is to enter somewhere when BD touched or price "pierced" through BD.  
  
The second leg in this example is clearly shorter than AB.  
  
Someone correct me if i am wrong. At least that's my definition of a good harmonic wolfe wave pattern. Still learning here also.

Hard to say without having taken Bill Wolfe's course. In all of the free online resources that I looked at, I never saw any mention of it as a necessary element to entry. The charts I saw just said that price more often than not pierces into the sweet zone. The AB=CD was just something that I thought would act as another layer of confluence, especially since the sweet zone on higher time frames can be 100-300 pips. This was my main question as I tried to learn on my own. Where exactly do you enter inside the sweet zone?  
  
As we have discussed a few times here already, other filters are surely needed for confluence and conformation. Right now I am looking at pitchforks, especially for flatter waves. Also, I think that Gann angles could be a very powerful tool in conjunction with WWs. I am trying to find a good free online study guide to learn more about Gann angles and fans. Creativity is only limited by our preconceptions of how it supposed to be done.  
  
That's why wanted this thread to be learning journey for pros and newbies alike. Surely, anyone at anytime could come up with a brilliant new way of thinking. So far I am very pleased and encouraged by all of participation here.  
  
The old saying, "United we stand, divided we fall" is very appropriate here at FF. I see way to many threads where ego trumps ego where people are too busy tearing each other down. The purpose here is to lift each other up.

Good example here on yet another USD/JPY 15 minute set up ( this pair has been acting in a very harmonic way lately). Was away from home and missed this one.  
  
Reversal starts just barely as price pierces the sweet zone, 3 pips short of AB=CD completion. Not a big deal even on this smaller time frame. Certainly no reason not to scale in from 141-161 FIB with a 10-15 pip SL above the 200FIB. A nice little 20+ pip bounce scalp if you will. In hindsight of course, but still always a lesson to be learned.  
  
Notice the pitchfork acts as a nice filter as price perfectly touches the median line right on the trend line.  
  
Sorry if this chart is a little "busy" on the eyes, just wanted to show the pitchfork

Hi Expo33, first compliments for what you're doing here. I'm not a fan of counter trend trades, but I like your attitude and the way you presented yourself so I'm following your interesting thread, trying lo learn as much as I can.  
  
I must say that I'm quite ready to do my first WW attempt on higher TF (mostly due to lack of time).  
  
Have you ever considered to use fib pivots as another layer? I found them useful, more than the traditional pivots, and are in line with harmonic structure you usually look for. I attach the indi I use, a friend of mine passed me some time ago and it's very flexible.

Hi L.m, welcome and thanks for the kind words.  
  
Yes I have looked at many pivot indicators, Murray math levels, etc etc. They each have their merit. I love the simplicity of WWs, but also love the flexibility in how one can go about filtering and confirming trade entries.   
  
Thanks for posting friend, look forward to any higher time frame set ups you find.

Hi dodeena. I traded the AUDCHF setup last week and it is still going on the direction of my wish.  
I was happy how the prediction works.   
I attached setup from my previous post 184, for reference.

Good morning Expo, what about a new try with tick volume . Bill Wolf put more emphasis on the volume. Accordioning to the PDF it is released, he would even reluctant to trade unless formation of point 5 is supported by heavy volume. Point 5 is wave D in our situation.

Dear Expo :  
I was reading this excellent thread all the way from the first page , and i hoped that you would discuss and teach us more about what was mentioned in the first post eg:  
  
**PWW = PARALLEL WOLFE WAVE**  
**AWW = ANTI WOLFE WAVE**  
that would be great if you write a little bit on these items too.  
are there other variant of ww that can be traded??  
As far as i got till now ,ww is part of a very larger group of Harmoinc patterns ,am i right ??  
do you trade other harmonics ??

I don't trade the chfs. As for aud and nzd, i don't see any good ones coming up. Especially after the fomc decision yesterday. I think it's wise to wait for the majors to form their own structures for a while. Maybe tomorrow might be good.  
  
Meanwhile, i am focusing on crosses today. Not much setups so far.

Yes I know he did. The problem is he didn't trade forex, he traded securities where true volume is known. In forex we don't have a centralized market to know the true volume.  
  
I do however look at the MFI (Bill Williams Market Facilitation Index)

> Dear Expo : I was reading this excellent thread all the way from the first page , and i hoped that you would discuss and teach us more about what was mentioned in the first post eg: PWW = PARALLEL WOLFE WAVE AWW = ANTI WOLFE WAVE that would be great if you write a little bit on these items too. are there other variant of ww that can be traded?? As far as i got till now ,ww is part of a very larger group of Harmoinc patterns ,am i right ?? do you trade other harmonics ??

Hi Parviz, sorry been super busy all day just sat down to look at some charts and read new posts.  
  
Yes, I think WWs in many instances are part of larger harmonic structures. And yes I have studied many harmonic structures over the years. I just like the simplicity of the WW and so I decided to focus on this one simple structure. I decided to try and be really good at one thing instead of being mediocre at many things.  
  
I never got around to putting up a diagram for the AWW and PWW because the intent was to focus on the classic WW first. The anti wave was just something I noticed when studying 1000s of charts. I just gave it that generic name. I'm not sure but I believe Bill Wolfe traded parallel waves. I haven't taken his course so can't say for sure. However, I have seen others traders talk about it in other threads.  
  
Here is an example of the AWW and PPW that I had saved on my computer. Not much different than the classic WW  
  
**AWW >> only difference** is that line XB and AC are diverging, not converging, and because of this, the sweet zone is rarely penetrated as much as it is in the CWW. The AB=CD completion level tends to take place at the 113 or 127 FIB.  
  
**PWW >> only difference** is that line XB is horizontal  
  
When I get time I will try to update the first post with a diagram for each. Hope this helps for now.

I hesitated waiting for a better entry and missed this nice little bounce. Sometimes waiting for a few extra pips on entry can cost you a nice trade. Oh well, moving right along

Per my own rules, my scale in zone would be from 107.60 - 107.90. My gut says it won't reach that price. If it does I will enter, if it doesn't I will pass and look for another set up.

Expo, thanks for your chart.  
I actually placed a buy entry @ 1.001 in asian session. Targeting 1.020. Then it just dropped to 0.990 in a minute. Then it dropped again to .985. I exited there, thinking it would drop to 0.960.  
  
15 pips loss.

May i share an opinion. Technically the chart looks bearish, since there is a leg hanging there without support. But market makers may think it should go up more.  
  
Or maybe it just smoke screen for bear. A camouflage.

Hey Expo   
  
thanks for all your hard work, I was just about to ask you if the sideways price action invalidated the USDCAD setup and you beat me to the punch.   
  
I notice that you have a lot of uncommon levels in the fib tool, in your experience are these all equally valid? Or are the regular levels more powerful?  
  
Thanks again

You're welcome and thanks for posting.  
  
Yes, the USD/CAD CD leg just started meandering too much and now has totally broken down below the AC trend line.   
  
At one time or another I have read about all of the FIB levels that I use. I guess it all depends on who you talk to. Nothing beats good old trial and error. I think all of those levels are useful in a given situation. For me, the wave angle has a lot to do with it. If you can find 1000 valid WWs and then put the FIB extension on each one, you begin to see the same pattern repeating.  
  
Here is a generic "cheat sheet" for some popular harmonic patterns. Notice every level I use is in there somewhere. Even the little used 141 level is in there (my personal favorite). If you google FIB levels, forex, etc you'll find some very good discussions on FIB levels  
  
Hope that helps, time for some rest here. Cheers

Missed this one while I was sleeping but a good example of how the AB=CD can help with entry on steep angled waves. Takes the guess work out of the equation. Good for 40 pips, not bad for a 15 minute time frame. Also AB and CD legs show great symmetry.

Interesting situation and one that comes up quite often on bigger time frames.  
  
My NZD/CHF 30MIN bullish PWW trade is still active, however, a bearish CWW developed on the 15MIN time frame. What to do? If it were at or near the target line or TP area then it would be a no brainer. End the trade manually and take the profits.  
  
But in this case, my original trade is kind of still in its infancy. Also, if the smaller bearish wave were to complete to the target line, it still wouldn't hit the SL for the original trade. So, I will let the trade run its course for now.  
  
All in all, I think this scenario is a good illustration and something that WW traders should always be watching out for. Waves are constantly in motion. They should be respected and monitored with due diligence.

Just scrolled back to find that wave, a little rough a round the edges but played out perfectly. Well done,I hope you traded it!

Hi Croc.  
  
I certainly don't have all the answers but just a couple of points in hindsight of course.  
  
That was tough one. So much momentum in the D leg from such a volatile pair. Imho the symmetry was a bit off. It took 11 candles for the AB leg to complete. Then the AB=CD completion level was basically reached in 3 candles on the CD leg.  
  
Also, not by much, but shorting above the nearest S/R instead of shorting "into" the S/R

A little update. Got 5 positions filled on this one. Hopefully we can get some more downward momentum heading into the New York session. One home run WW on a higher time frame can make for a big month. I would love to get down to level B by market close today and move all positions to BE. That would put a good taste in my mouth for the weekend!

I'm not sure what your first question is. If you are asking if the wave that fantom posted is a parallel Wolfe wave (PWW), then the answer is no. It's a classic Wolfe wave (CWW) because it's converging.  
  
I don't understand what your asking or whats going on in your first chart  
  
I posted a diagram in post #1 of how I take profit, especially for higher time frames where I have scaled in with multiple positions. It is a generic guideline. I think take profit strategy is personal to every trader and is based on their risk profile. I see you have weekly pivots, works fine as well. Imo, there is no right or wrong way.  
  
Not sure if this helps

just my opinion, if you want to use heiken, thats fine, but adding the multiple MA/vegas tunnel? will only cloud your judgement more.  
  
And yes, that looks like a CWW.  
  
Also, what broker are you with? a 2point spread on usd/.jpy? Seems a bit too much aint it?

For those who have not yet entered and are still looking for a decent point to enter the EURUSD WW that Expo has outlined, here is a 5 min channel that may still be operating so maybe look for a decent show of bear strength for the start of a move down. There has already been a strong bear break below the nested channel hugging the channel line so that is a decent show by the bears. Now a failed BO above the high or the top of the channel could herald the start of a decent move down, at least to the bottom of the channel. Maybe....

It's never easy it seems. I'm willing to hold this one as long as it takes though. Either I get stopped out or I get some substantial pips

Missed this one. Not really a CWW or AWW as the trend lines basically form a perfect channel. A quick 20+ pips to the target line

Sometimes tough on the smaller time frames, not much of a scale in zone. I tend to enter a few pips before the completion level. On higher time frames love to scale in early with smaller positions.  
  
Anyways, plenty of other opportunities as you said

Wrapping up a very good week. Looking forward to clearing the charts and getting a fresh look for next week. I find Friday is a good time for reflection; to think about some errors we have made and how we will inject a new positive way of thinking and doing for the week ahead.   
  
**Less is often more**  
  
If you are struggling or on a string of losers, trade less. When we are looking for something, it's human nature to sometimes see something that really isn't there. The nature of this strategy is to find and trade Wolfe waves and I think sometimes it's natural to force price into the pattern we want to see. Price does what it does. It's our job to make sure price action fits the Wolfe wave parameters with the best possible structure.   
  
A shiny car with a crappy engine isn't going to cut it in the long run. The old adage, "you can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig" is very true here as well. We can draw lines and make all kinds of fancy diagrams and doll up our charts in every imaginable way, but if the nuts and bolts of our wave structure are faulty, then the chance for success is limited.  
  
Demand quality from yourself and from your Wolfe waves. Always quality over quantity. There are 100+ valid waves each week, but you only need 2 or 3 to make your account grow consistently and significantly.  
  
Confluence is king. Beware if it's not there.  
  
Have a great weekend everyone and thanks for all of the posts this week. I am really pleased with how much work we have all done so far.

This thread is really interesting  
Timing, for me, could not be better as I'm investigating a kind of wave recently which allows the market to balance itself by causing some pain to the crowd.  
The wolfe wave is really similar to this.  
Do you ever thought about why they appear and tend to work more often than not?  
Of course, many know that the market follows harmonics but there's also a big psychological component to it.  
In my opinion, the market is designed to allow only a few to succeed and as soon as the crowd moves out of balance to a favored direction (short/long) the market has to rebalance itself in the interest of the few successful and smart traders.  
So a wolfe wave is in essence a confirmed trend segment and we all know the story about HH HL (uptrend) - LL LH (downtrend) and what is written in the many trading books about how to trade a trend. Now, Bill Wolfe was genius to notice this and he even called it market balance when price moves from the sweet zone to the target EPA line which involves a break of structure in opposite direction with a wash out (stop hunt).

Since the market is fractal in its nature, it makes sense to check the HTF waves and cycles in progress to make sure to not go against them.  
Bill Wolfe wrote in his book that if price misses the EPA line often then he suggests to change the time frame because the dominant wave is probably on a different time frame:

Thanks Expo33 for the great and absolutely clear explanations and examples.  
Learning about the sweet zone and your addition of using harmonics for confluence is a real insight.  
Also nice results too, keep going ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Hi Juri.  
  
Thank you for the kind words and thank you also for your amazing post! This is a gem in the rough and exactly why I wanted to start this thread. Best post we've had so far, and one I think every trader here should read. Thanks for taking the time to clearly explain your point. Very well presented and a great perspective for all of us to consider. Hope you stick around and help us along our journey.  
  
I believe the market player's behavior is mapped out in a harmonic nature. The underlying truth is hidden within the price action from this harmonic nature and I think that very few can see that hidden truth. To me, the market is a living organism that moves in relation to the collective behavior of it's participants, the humans.

Yes it is one, with a retracement / retest, but the setup was there and if the wolfe wave unfolded then it was a trend continuation pattern which might be a good confidence boost to get in, anyway I would have.

As someone said in the thread, wolfe waves are part of bigger harmonic pattern, yes it is, very correlated, to elliot waves, the differents ab=cd patterns like flat, triangles, abc, impulsive wave, corrective wave, 2d wave, 4th wave, etc...

Dear Expo:  
Here i would like to dedicate this small modification I tried to do on Wolfewave indicator , it now tries to detect wolfe wave better and according to it rule , if it can not find a good setting it does not draw any thing, the waves are numbered in digits and alphabet , the number beside Point (C) is amount of its fibo Retracement ,and that on point (D) its fibo extention comparred to AB line ,I hope it will be bug free, and every body use and enjoy as I am.

Hello Niaz, welcome to forex factory.  
  
Thanks for using the template and for clearly marking everything out. It helps me a lot as my eyes are very sensitive.  
  
I never want to dissuade someone from taking or not taking a trade as I certainly don't have all the answers but there are a couple of things I see with this trade that may present a problem.  
  
First off, when I mapped this out it shows that XB is actually a bit less than parallel, so structurally this wave isn't technically valid. Not a deal breaker but certainly something to be aware of.  
  
More importantly, there is a subsequent new wave developing here. Notice right now price is at a minor resistance, and then notice that the major resistance falls exactly where this new wave completes at the AB=CD level. I tried to make it clear on the chart. Also interesting is the spot where price reversed on your initial wave, exactly at point C of the new wave. Probably not a coincidence.

**  
  
I'll preface this next chart by saying I am in my infancy in studying Gann angles. One thing I do know is they supposedly work better on higher time frames. Gann angles are unique in that they map out price AND time. I put a Gann angle on our chart and it seems to paint an interesting picture.  
  
Gann theory says that when price breaks through one angle it is likely to continue to the next angle. In our scenario the 1x1 (45 degree) angle has been broken and price is heading towards the 1x2 angle. Interesting to note on our new wave that the 1x3 Gann angle crosses very near the ETA (Estimated Time of Arrival), which just happens to be near the 200FIB AND AB=CD completion level. Is price heading down to that point of confluence? I don't know but if it breaks through the 1x2 Gann angle, it could be.  
  
Here is the same chart as above but with the Gann angles shown

Anyways ,that's my analysis for the chart you posted. I hope it helps in some way. Thanks again for posting and good trading to you. Please feel free to post any charts that you have questions about or anything else you want to share with us.

Hi Parviz.  
  
Thanks for sharing this indicator. A couple of questions for you  
  
1) Are you at liberty to share the code source as I would love to modify the line thickness and color, etc  
  
2) Does the indicator only show the wave after completion? I'm wondering at what point the indicator decides the wave is complete? The reason I ask is because I draw all my waves free hand and tend to scale into my positions as price is heading towards the completion level. So I like to be prepared to execute before the wave actually completes. I know many others wait for a candle reversal or TDI cross for confirmation so this indicator would be very useful to them. Of course, I think it's important for traders to be able to map out the waves free hand as it is a good point for learning the structure.  
  
3) When I tested it on some charts it only shows the wave that has presently completed? Is that true?  
  
Looking forward to you thoughts. Thanks again for sharing with us. Certainly the best functioning WW indicator I have ever tried

Well according to WW theory the actual wave would have been complete long before where the indicator shows point D. That's why I asked in my previous post how the indicator decides where the wave is complete because in this example the D point doesn't remotely line up with the sweet zone theory.

Certainly harmonic in nature but not a Wolfe wave. With all due respect, I'm trying to keep the focus here on WWs. There a couple of really good threads on FF that focus on the more complex harmonic patterns  
  
Ironically, I had been tracking a very nice CWW on the NZD/CAD weekly but the structure, although still valid, started to break down over the last month.  
  
**NOTE:** The confluence between the AB=CD completion level and the 161FIB is pretty amazing, especially for a weekly chart!

My apology. I am that expert in WW. Maybe you don't intend this forum to be WW beginners. If that's the case, just point it out. I will be glad to WO from this discussion.

Hi Frx, I hope you weren't offended  
  
This thread is for anyone interested in WWs, beginner or expert. Maybe I misunderstood your post. I was just trying to say that what you posted wasn't a Wolfe wave. I wasn't sure if you knew that or if you were just posting a different harmonic structure for discussion.  
  
I just want the focus to be on WWs and not on the other more complex harmonic patterns. I just think it may confuse new traders that aren't well versed in this area.  
  
Please feel free to post anything that you think may be a WW and we are all happy to disucss

Thanks brother.  
  
Well, we made it over 400 posts before our first awkward moment. I think maybe something was lost in the translation. Onward we go!  
  
By the way, I will be flying to Florida for vacation on the 23rd and getting on a Royal Caribbean cruise ship with my 5 year old daughter. I am meeting some family that winters down in Florida. I will be totally off line during the cruise from the 25th to the 30th. The rest of the time I will only be able to view this thread from my phone as I promised the family I wouldn't bring my laptop with me. Back home on April 2nd.  
  
Bottom line, I hope the thread stays at least somewhat active. I trust you'll step up your game![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60e.png?v=15.1)  
  
This thread has blessed me tremendously. I think I have learned more since I started this thread than I have in the past 3 months

Consider this a failed example? Or stoploss not wide enough?  
  
Edit: I just found out that if the start of C leg is robust or very volatile, it's usually bad for the CD leg or it may extend longer  
  
CD LEG VARIATIONS  
These CD leg phenomena can be described in four ways:  
1.  
If after point C has occurred a gap exists in the direction of point D,  
this usually indicates that the CD leg will be much greater than the AB  
leg—1.272, 1.618, or more.  
2.  
A wide range bar (twice normal size) at point C is another indication  
that the CD leg could become extended.  
3.  
Ideally, AB  
=  
CD moves are symmetrical in price and time. For exam-  
ple, if the AB leg is six bars up, then the CD leg will be six bars up.

A lot of different view points I'm sure.  
  
1) Original bounce lower from AB=CD = 1.4032 was about 15 pips, so there would have been the opportunity to move SL to BE.  
  
2) Very volatile pair. In hindsight a 30 SL would have covered it. That's not really that big of a SL considering a minimum move back to the X level was about 60 pips. Smaller position sizes needed for sure.  
  
3) Big 2 candle D leg power move up automatically makes the candle symmetry very bad so a warning signal right from the start. Zooming out to the hourly and waiting for a TDI cross takes away the uncertainty of that whole volatile sweet zone.  
  
4) Plenty of other opportunities. I think just the act of passing is a very good mental exercise in patience and is a building block to becoming a ninja type Wolfe wave stalker!  
  
**With due diligence we can always attempt to find a solution to our problem: Where do we enter the trade?**  
  
All in hindsight but this is how we can train ourselves to look at our problem from multiple angles (no pun intended)  
  
Zooming out to the hourly, I built the Gann angles using the Fib fan and look what it shows. The AB=CD completion level is still in "no mans" land. Price had broken north through the previous Gann angle, had a little re trace at the AB=CD level then continued north for one last surge EXACTLY to the next Gann angle before heading down 100 pips!!

If using 30 pips as a stoploss, then this previous wolfe wave might as well ended up a breakeven also because price never reached there, not to mention the EPA. If i based my stoploss of this chart at the 2 fibo line there, it would be around 30 to 37pips depend on whether you entered on 1.27 or 1.41.  
  
That is why i am currently starting to feel a little headache about position management. Should i use larger stops? Or lesser stops and quickly get out of the position?  
  
Keep in mind that wolfe wave is basically an anti trend thing. We are selling at the highest point of a strong move up and vice versa. Most of my losses trades are being taken out quite fast. No hovering near my stops for a long time.  
  
Would welcome any suggestions on position management.

> {quote} Hi Parviz. Thanks for sharing this indicator. A couple of questions for you 1) Are you at liberty to share the code source as I would love to modify the line thickness and color, etc 2) Does the indicator only show the wave after completion? I'm wondering at what point the indicator decides the wave is complete? The reason I ask is because I draw all my waves free hand and tend to scale into my positions as price is heading towards the completion level. So I like to be prepared to execute before the wave actually completes. I know many others...

Thanks a lot for testing and approving the indicator :you know i am not a professional programer and i do it just as a hobby  
1.sure i will ,i'll send you the source if i may have your email .  
2\. yes it wait till the D wave is touching or above the trend line .As i learned many wait for entry till not only for breaking out of trend line but even for the wave to finish its retracement and retouch of trend line . so with this type of trading this indicator would tell you ahead of time when there is a good WW.  
3\. my suggestion is to use this indicator for a very fast scanning of different securities pairs and Time frames, then you may come back and reexamine each manually.  
4 . the indicator works on zigzag indicator , so it wait till the D wave is formed (reversal happens) , then it will have the necessary 5 waves for proper analysis .  
  
ps: By the way I believe I may change the code so that it can even shows the potential ww waves , if we do not have complete D wave ,then a potential CWW can only be predicted if XB and AC line are converging. Am i right ?, if this is all that is necessary then it can be applied.

That's why I asked in my previous post how the indicator decides where the wave is complete because in this example the D point doesn't remotely line up with the sweet zone theory.

hi expo :  
there is another very important factor in detection of ww by this indicator , and that is the setting of ExtDepth input ,here i will show two picture of the same pair and time frame ,one with ExtDepth set to 6 and the other to 12 , as you noticed the 6 one detect earlier CWW:

Hey Kurt,  
  
Great thread you started here! I'm still trying to catch up with older posts, but I wanted to know if if your intent is to keep this discussion specific to forex instruments only?  
  
Right now 100% of my focus is day trading the ES on a very short time frame. I mostly just trade the first two hours of the session primarily off a 1min chart. But I do keep an eye out on wolf waves and really like that pattern.  
  
If I were to start all over again, I think I would have initially focused my energy on swing trading higher time frames first then working on intra-day trading which I think is much harder.  
  
Anyways, wanted to say congrats and thanks for the effort you put into this thread. It's got me thinking of picking up a forex pair I could swing trade through futures at a different time of day so it wouldn't compete with my attention so much during ES open. Do you think USD/JPY would be good for that? I admittedly don't know much about forex I havent' spent much time trading it.  
  
Also what is that stat that follows your post about being up 9.3% this month, I've never seen that on anyone else's posts, how does that work, are you running a fund or something?  
  
Thanks,  
RH

If i based my stoploss of this chart at the 2 fibo line there, it would be around 30 to 37pips depend on whether you entered on 1.27 or 1.41.

Separate waves, this is the first wave.  
  
If you zoom out you can see that the most recent important S/R is right at the ABCD completion level. The only problem I see here is the round number so you know there should be supply heading towards 140. Turns out there was and price bounce 30 pips back down. Scaling in early with smaller positions lessens the total risk, plus if price reverses early you wont miss the bounce. Excellent symmetry length and time too.  
  
Also, the TMS angulator shows all time frames are either down or moving sideways, so really shorting here is not going against the general trends.

That makes good sense. I'm always fiddling with extdepth on my zig zag to try and get the legs to fit the wave I'm analyzing

Thanks RH.  
  
WW theory works on all time frame and all instruments. Feel free to post any instrument you are trading. Bill Wolfe didn't trade forex he traded securities, indexes, etc. Volume spikes around reversals were an important part of his analysis, unfortunately in forex we don't have access to true volume.  
  
The 9.3% is how much my Demo account has gained since I started it 8 days ago. I'm not trading anyone else's money although I did have someone message me and offer me a chance to trade a PAMM account for a new brokerage provided my tracked trading live explorer met their specifications. If you click on the link it will take you to my profile and at the bottom has all of the particulars of the trade explorer. In the settings a trader can have the explorer show at the bottom of their posts as mine does. I use it as a tool to monitor my risk management and also to show that the system works. Obviously, you don't have the same emotions as real money but it's still a great way to test new systems. I would encourage everyone to demo test WWs first until you have proven to yourself that you can execute the strategy successfully.  
  
Look forward to your posts and best of trading to you

Dear expo:  
This is another example of the difference between 6 and 12 setting on same pair and same TF . Is this what you were asking , and looking for..?  
the smallest the ExtDepth the more recent waves are shown , though less than 3 is not working reliably.

Hi Dude,  
  
as very often, a trend continuation wolfe wave will form just after the neck line break of an head and shoulder..., so yes this a failed wolfe wave but what a wonderful head and shoulders, that is why a wolf wave as a trend continuation pattern would have been worth the risk, because of a failed head and shoulders.  
  
Risk vs reward is the key among consistancy.  
  
It is also my preferred wolf wave because it lines up with the corrective wave of elliot wave theory (ABC) that is a trend continuation pattern ready to ride the next impulsive wave, be it the 3rd or the 5th wave.  
  
I am sure Expo33 will be very interested, it is a nice filter instead of some creepy indicators.

I never want to dissuade someone from taking or not taking a trade as I certainly don't have all the answers but there are a couple of things I see with this trade that may present a problem. First off, when I mapped this out it shows that XB is actually a bit less than parallel, so structurally this wave isn't technically valid. Not a deal breaker but certainly something to be aware...

Hi Expo33 and all,  
  
the first problem on the wolf waves is the fractal off it, when unfolding in another and another and another and also the counter trend nature of it, in a strong trend you will have a lot of wolfe waves anticipation that you will trade but are just an ABC trend continuation pattern (ABC being 123 or XAB by expo33) and I do mean a lot, so beware the drawdown therefore money / risk management.  
  
For ABC patterns just look at elliot waves theory.

That is a nice Gartley pattern but definitively not a Wolfe wave.

Hi Parviz,  
  
the D on your screenshot was way too far, it should have been close to the 1-3 trend line and not much more than a AB=CD pattern, like a "zone" your D point was a what, like 500% expansion and 800% extension ? where is the AB=CD in this ?  
  
The key on this pattern is symmetry on the XY basis.  
  
Thanks for posting anyway.

Also I wanted to contribute to the great work of Expo33 by adding this elliot wave formation that is a wolf wave reversal pattern being a 5th elliot wave (ending diagonal), confluence is the key to filter out bad trades.

You know what is my problem dude, I want to code it ,so what i need are exact figures , like when we say AB=CD,+/- of how much is acceptable..?  
for example give me a percentage.(like AB/CD ratio should be between 90% to 110% )

I do not think it is possible to code it.  
  
What I meant by confluence is a meeting of two pattern at least.

I could also contribute some thoughts to this interesting thread (once again thanks to Expo for initiating). I would echo the thoughts of LDFX in that it would be extremely difficult to code this sort of thing and, more importantly, that confluence is the key. The attached chart should help to explain the confluence effect and why the market turned where it did on Friday afternoon. There is no substitute for hard work and looking for likely Support and Resistance including, but not limited to, prior highs and lows, trend and channel lines, signal bar highs and lows, measured move targets, previous day OHLC etc. A Wolfe Wave is a reversal pattern and will only ever take place at support or resistance so trying to identify these areas is the key. So what can we identify from the H4 chart attached?  
1) A channel line from 8 Dec through Feb 2 and extended to the right (I tend to think that tails on top / bottom of bars represent slight over-extension when testing a level so I look for a likely place for the line to pass through in real time. Here, we have the benefit of hindsight).  
2) Sunday 5th Feb produced a bear signal bar (circled) whose low had not yet been tested and was , therefore, a magnet.  
3) Late Feb into early March produced a trading range and double bottom bull flag pattern which afforded a measured move target as shown by the red bars so was another magnet.  
4) The yellow bars represent a leg 1 = leg 2 measured move. It is possible to get a better approximation than the move shown by looking at where the likely start and end of the first leg really were. For instance, I would surmise that the first leg started with a test of the March 3 signal bar high and finished on the channel line just under the yellow bar at around 10700, but again that is easy to say with the benefit of hindsight - at any rate, another magnet was in the same general area.  
So we have 4 resistance points clustered in the same area and that confluence of resistance led to a reversal and maybe the start of the Wolfe Wave playing out.  
An obvious downside target where support may kick in is the signal bar high on Mar 15th @ around 10640.

>

For me the extdepth setting isn't the issue. My issue is I have the wave mapped out before it completes and already have my entry strategy in place so I already know the wave is there in the first place. Still, it's a good tool and would save time for anyone who wants to study the waves after they've completed.  
  
For others, they may find it useful if they are struggling to find or see the wave on their own. Also, many traders like to enter the trade after the wave has completed and reversed so that would still be helpful to them as well.

Back in front of the screen. Time to get a fresh look at the charts and see what's developing for the week ahead.  
  
By the way, some good discussions, much appreciated.

Taking a shot with WTI CRUDE OIL  
  
**Confluence factors:**  
  
1) Previous S/R  
2) Gann angle support  
3) AB=CD and 200FIB lines up well with this area  
  
**Notes:** Not my usual move but this time I waited for a TDI cross before entry. A move back up here is also the BC leg of a larger wave so I will be watching closely for an early exit if needed

I noticed that too, I thought I was hallucinating. I was positive I put a trend line on my chart but it disappeared.

hey dude,  
  
I am glad you get over this martingale bs, but do not get too exited, wolf wave is a purely counter trend pattern, you will be chasing falling knives that are the most rewarding but the most difficult losses to manage.

Hey brother I'm trying to figure out what you're trading. I'm assuming it's just based on price action because I don't see any Wolfe wave. That's fine, I just am confused

Hi, I was giving this some thought over the weekend and I don't think that it is entirely true that it is purely a countertrend pattern. I suppose it depends on one's perspective. For instance, suppose we have a broad bull channel on, say, the H4 timeframe where price has come down to touch the trend line. Let's take a textbook TR / channel scenario where we are looking at a nice two legs up from the bottom to the top of the channel. The pullback in between the legs could very well have the stair-stepping pattern on a lower timeframe (say 15min) indicative of a Wolfe Wave setup on that timefreame, but to a price action trader it is merely a flag where a bull breakout towards the top of the H4 channel is expected. Therefore, although the Wolf Wave is reversing the smaller 15min trend, the trade is in the direction of the H4 trend and therefore a continuation setup and higher probability.  
Or am I stating the bleeding obvious?!

FTSE (UKX) H1 (also visible on H4) - I would be very wary of this and would want to see some very strong selling before entering as this is very much countertrend.

Easy, a wolfe wave to unfold need 3 waves that you will enter against it at the end of the third wave.  
  
it is then a pure counter trend trading, you can still say the primary trend blabla, but 3 waves in a direction and taking the opossite side is not purely counter trend ?  
  
you are trading against the momentum, it is what gives the strenght to the wolf wave but is also its weakness.

Yeah, Gambling at people's SL, that's the way WW works...

I think you have completely missed the point of what I am saying.  
If it was not clear, then my apologies. The way many traders enter trends is by waiting for a pullback - agreed? By definition, a pullback is a smaller trend in the opposite direction so entering the main trend again is trading counter and against the momentum of the pullback. Obviously the pullback has to be weak in relation to the trend. So, a higher probability way to trade the Wolfe Wave pattern is to identify the setup on a lower time frame during a pullback in an obvious higher time frame trend. Makes perfect sense to me, but then again, I accept that my beliefs about the market may not be useful to others. You pay your money and take your choice.

Ok now I see what you are trying to trade. It's not a classic Wolfe wave because line XB and AC don't converge. Technically it fits my made up definition of an Anti wave because those two lines are diverging. Unfortunately the structure and symmetry are really not very good

hi dude,  
  
I totally got your point, for me any pull back is a counter trend entry, the wolfe wave being one of the most needed trend in order to unfold, x abcd needs time and space aka a trend.  
  
A stop order above the high would be a trend continuation entry, there is of course trend continuation patterns but that are taken in counter trend.  
  
To make it simple, when price makes lower low and you buy, it is a counter trend entry, if price makes higher high and you buy it is a trend continuation entry.

Hey,  
Fair enough. The way you view the market is no doubt useful to you and that's great. For me there are many ways to view situations. For example, as a trend trader you would bet on most attempts to reverse the trend being unsuccessful. Therefore buying on a limit order below prior bars in a bull trend can be a prudent thing to do. One would be betting on continuation of the trend, but if the prior bar was a bear bar (and therefore a bear trend on some lower timeframe) by your definition it would be a purely counter trend trade. I guess it's all a matter of perspective.

Well not exactly, I was speaking about a counter trend once 3 waves unfolded to meet a wolfe wave which the entry would be counter trend because you would buy a bottom.  
  
Is a wolf wave not a pattern with 3 lower lows ? Then buying in this scenario is not a counter trend trade ?

I guess it depends on the scale you are watching.  
There's no **one** trend IMHO, only waves within waves

Mate, we are talking at cross-purposes.  
Like I said, it's all about perspective and timeframe. What I am suggesting is using the lower time frame Wolfe Wave set up to enter the larger trend which can be expected to continue (since most reversal attempts fail). It is perfectly feasible, in a bull trend on one timeframe to have a bear bar, which when dissected on some lower time frame, could contain a Wolf Wave setup. Entering on a limit below that higher time frame bear bar is identical to trading the Wolf Wave on the lower timeframe. So yes, I totally agree that it is counter trend to the lower time frame trend - although it is debatable whether it would really be a trend as a Wolf Wave setup (generally) has many overlapping bars and is really an expanding trading range.   
It is a different kettle of fish entirely if the Wolfe Wave setup takes the market below a prior MAJOR low (ie a low after which the market had a strong breakout to give a new high) on the chart on which you are looking to enter the trend. Minor lows get taken out all of the time during two / three / x legged pullbacks and are of no consequence  
What I am not talking about here is the more classical reversal Wolfe Wave at the top or bottom of a trend. In these cases I agree that most set ups will fail because that is the nature of reversals.  
  
The idea is to add value to this thread and try to come up with ways to improve the Wolfe Wave strategy for those who actually trade it. By thinking about it from a pure price action point of view, using different timeframes can help to gain perspective.  
All the best.

Hehe buddy,  
  
a trend is very subjective anyways, if you prefer, I do call a trend the momentum that is taking out highs or lows, now trend as so called by many fx retail traders can be interpreted very much differently on any given time frame which is at the best just lagging, momentum is the key and the actual trend.  
When a wolfe wafe is unfolding you do take entry on a lower low that is the 3rd low of the wolf wave pattern, if that is not a counter trend...

Hi Expo, in a situation like this (EJ 1H) with a possible AB=CD completion right at the BRN 120.00, where would you start scaling? As said, I'm not used to go counter trend and that would make me start scaling at 161.8 ext down to the BRN but maybe it's too conservative?  
Thanks

Hi Lm  
  
I wouldn't be scaling in until the 200FIB. I zoomed out to show the strong support at 120. If price makes it down that far, you can imagine there will be a lot of demand heading into the 120 area. I would start scaling in with very small positions first. Hopefully the chart is self explanatory.  
  
Well spotted wave though and best of luck with this trade if it happens

So many great posts.   
  
Unfortunately I have about 12 hours of commitments until tomorrow morning so I will be away from the screen.  
  
Yesterday I took a bit hit on a losing oil trade. Was on the phone blabbering away as I entered the trade and completely had my settings wrong for my risk parameters. On top of that, I had my SL on the wrong side of the FIB that was in play. As a result, instead of a small loss, it cost me a draw down far beyond my risk profile.  
  
Lesson learned, "hands free" device doesn't mean your brain is free to focus on the task at hand!! Foolish mistake on my part. Trading is hard enough as it is without making careless mistakes.   
  
Anyways, the only thing I have going is the EUR/USD short from last week. Hopefully we can break the 1.0725 area and gets some more downward momentum  
  
Thanks for all of the great post ladies and gents. I am anxious to read through all of them when I get home tomorrow

im on my phone at the moment so I can't help much but if you look at the PDF overview in post #1 you will see examples of both bullish and bearish WWs.

Thanks for your reply Expo, my concern was in fact the likely push toward the BRN.

It's not correct, if you scroll the pages you'll find many bullish/bearish example. Just one tip, if it's an ascending WW like the one in your post, it's a bearish pattern and that means point X must be a swing high. Hope this helps

this does not look like a wolfe wave formation. Your point 1 or X is incorrect.

Hi fantom,  
At the very start of this thread, Expo has very thoughtfully included a download link for the Wolfe Wave book. It really is worth a read.

If I correctly read your chart, it doesn't seem a WW. In a descending pattern X should be a swing low and it's always between points B and C.

Yes, the lines are not converging you are correct. Point 4 in this case it above point 2 and therefore I accept that this is not a standard wave.   
Apart from the fact that the SPTRD (US500) was selling off at the time, the context was good for a reversal up given that we were at the bottom of a bear channel whilst at the bottom of a broader bull channel - therefore a duelling lines pattern and a confluence of support. An expanding triangle had also just completed and that is trading range price action so I was looking for additional reasons to enter long at the bottom of the trading range. As we now know, the ftse sold off and it was a losing trade.

I must have misunderstood your chart, that's not what I was saying. In any case sorry it was a losing trade.

Hi all,  
Making my way through the thread and am finding it very interesting. I did download the Wolfe Wave template etc from first page. I have a question about the TDI clock. Can someone explain to me what it all means. I get that the arrows mean up, down or sideways but there are angles in degrees and comments on it too eg strong up etc. If any one can help me figure this thing out and how it helps with the Wolfe Wave trading I would be extremely grateful.  
About me I have been teaching myself to trade for a little while but still feel very much an amateur so any help is welcome. Not out to buy a Ferrari but just to make life a little bit easier.

Hi and welcome.  
I don't use the indicator or the template, but taking a guess, the 'too strong up' would mean that the momentum up is too strong to be thinking about going short - at least for the time being. Would that make sense? I'm sure one of the others on here who do use the template will give some comments later.  
Cheers and best of luck.

This is the new version, it detect WW when the following conditions are true :  
  
if(  
Low[Wolf[1]]<High[Wolf[2]] &&  
Low[Wolf[3]]<Low[Wolf[1]] &&  
Low[Wolf[3]]<High[Wolf[4]] &&  
High[Wolf[4]]>Low[Wolf[1]] &&  
Low[Wolf[5]]<=Low[Wolf[3]]  
)  
{  
WolfWave="Buy";  
}  
//---------------------  
if  
(  
High[Wolf[1]]>Low[Wolf[2]] &&  
High[Wolf[3]]>High[Wolf[1]] &&  
High[Wolf[3]]>Low[Wolf[4]] &&  
Low[Wolf[4]]<High[Wolf[1]] &&  
High[Wolf[5]]>=High[Wolf[3]]  
)  
{  
WolfWave="Sell";  
}  
And it also print all five standard fibo relations of harmonic patterns and now the position of text can be set .  
Any suggestions, ideas, reporting bugs found..., are most welcome and appreciated.

Hey Parvis  
  
Many thanks for all of your hard work and brilliant coding!  
  
When i test the indicator I still see cases where the lines AC and XB do not converge.  
I am thinking that if you began the setup test with something like:  
If (absvalue(X-A) > absvalue(B-C)), then could be valid setup.  
Not too sure how to do that in MQL4, I am thinking that all you need is the price at each point to determine convergence.  
I think that the logic is OK and covers all cases.  
  
hope this is useful  
  
Keith

I would think that this WW is very much in play now as we have had a strong first leg of selling. I would expect a second leg down after a correction

Can you explain why this is a Wolfe Wave? I thought they had to form a channel and the waves be of similar size. Is that wrong? you have a trend line at the top but where is the parallel trend line at the bottom or the waves?

Hi all:  
If you read the wolfe book on finding the necessary points that form WW wave you notice he suggest to find them in order of 2,3,1,4 and finally 5,  
Let me give you another idea which i believe may help novices like me to find any harmonics pattern including WW .  
1)Find any combination of waves that form a (W) or (M) shape .  
2) Just put your B(3) point in the center of (W) oR (M).  
3) on The opposite side of the B(3) there are 2 point on right and left of the B(3) name them A(2) and C(4) respectively.  
4) Now the end of the right leg is X(1) point and that of the left one is D(5) .  
5)Connect with two Trend Line point X(1) to B(3) and point A(2) to C(4) respectively.  
6) Now You have the pattern , if the two Trend Line converge You Have the setting for WW ready and should wait for completion of D(5)point.  
7) Otherwise compare it to the other harmonic patterns using the cheat sheets and 5 fibo relations.  
I hope this will help many who are still confused about labelling the points and legs .

> {quote} Hey Parvis Many thanks for all of your hard work and brilliant coding! When i test the indicator I still see cases where the lines AC and XB do not converge. I am thinking that if you began the setup test with something like: If (absvalue(X-A) > absvalue(B-C)), then could be valid setup. Not too sure how to do that in MQL4, I am thinking that all you need is the price at each point to determine convergence. I think that the logic is OK and covers all cases. hope this is useful Keith

Thanks for the kind words:  
Indeed i have tried that , then it limits finding of the pattern even more so that it hardly if ever find any ,so i let the user find which one would be acceptable WW.  
Today i have posted a message which could help novices like me to easily find any harmonic pattern .

I'm not entirely sure what you are saying. Your 1,2,3,4,5 pattern is no Wolfe Wave setup so I presume it's some other sort of price action entry? Please would you explain so I can understand?

Hey Bud From what i understand there are many forms of Wolfe Waves. All im looking for is 3 waves up or down a extended break a potential pull back into the channel from some type of harmonic. As you can see i have drawn the first pattern then a second potential pattern. inside the second pattern there was a W formed at ac now i have drawn a line from the first pattern W at B or 1 and extended it across as a tl to form a support I lined it from 1 to 4 and 4 being X of the second harmonic . So should get a W to a M

Thanks :  
I am not expert in this field , i am just learning , it is about a week since i learned about what is called WW, i did Know Elliot's waves and channel trading ,but not this one, happened that i got an indicator , and changed it to may favor , and then decided to share it with other people here ,thought it may be helpful to others too, i am a real novices, not a good trader ,not a real programer.

Hey everyone I will be travelling for the next 10 days, 5 of which will be on a cruise ship to Mexico so I will be offline for the most part.  
  
I see in the last couple of days this thread has somehow morphed into harmonic patterns that aren't Wolfe waves. With all due respect can we please stick to Wolfe waves. That was the whole point of the thread; to keep it simple. Anyone new to the thread will be completely confused if they read the first post then see patterns that aren't remotely Wolfe waves.  
  
There are plenty of excellent threads that focus on the many harmonic patterns. Can we please keep this one solely for Wolfe waves.  
  
Thanks and good trading!

Maybe you could provide some type of online reference that shows Wolfe waves of this type as you say because to my knowledge these aren't Wolfe waves at all, but rather part of the larger branch of harmonic structures: gartleys, bats, butterflies, etc.  
  
With all due respect, this thread is solely for Wolfe waves. New traders trying to learn the simple WW structure will be confused.

Losing trades are part of trading. There were actually only 2 losing trades, just many scaled in positions. I am testing out some new scale in strategies. This is what demo's are used for; testing new ways of trading

Expo33 said exactly what I was thinking. Just started trying to get to grips with Wolfe Waves and finding some of the posts very confusing as they don't seem to stick to the rules of the WW from page 1. I would like to get back to basics and would love someone to explain how to use the TDI indicator Clock as I haven't found any info on that yet.  
Many thanks in advance.

Hi Caledonia, I can't help you with the TDI clock because I don't use it. What I can tell you is that it's not necessary and it's the least important part of the system. You can scale in the trades like Expo does or use the PA to decide when to enter the trades.

Hi Caledonia.  
  
Post #245 talks a little about the angleator and the TDI clock. I just use it as a quick visual reference for multi time frame trends, overbought/sold conditions. When I get back from vacation April 3rd I will try to update post #1 with any helpful info on this indicator. Scrolling through the inputs and then trying to decipher what's actually being presented may be of some help.

Not here to dispute or confuse , Im here to share ...As attached a Wolfe wave and a chart and mine. the rule is to allow price to enter back into the 1 to 3 Tl then trade it back to the the 1 to 4. Yes this is a ww thread but i when everyone is possibly trying to find on the opposing side you can plot it like i did. use 2 to 3 length and extend it up from the low at 5 . that will give you xa= cd

I wasn't implying that you were here to dispute, just saying that the chart you posted wasn't a Wolfe wave and that it would likely be confusing to anyone new to the WW structure.  
  
The diagram you posted below is exactly as the one on post #1, perfect, as this is what this thread is all about. If experienced traders here are using other structures to confirm trades, that's great, just don't wan't any new traders that are struggling to get confused.

All good mate the first charts i should of plotted what i just done in the last chart. i Was aware of the left hand side structure 135 and my own method of measuring 2 to 3 and extending up from the false tl breakout 5 or C to give ab= cd inverted or xa =cd on completion.

Actually your 1 is supposed to be lower than 4. 1 is supposed to be in the middle of 3 and 4. That is not a wolfe wave.

Yes in a perfect world and in that explanation it would be an ab =cd being 2 to 3 and 4 to 5 but in saying that the rule is there. any bullsi sign back above the 1 t 3 tl trade it back to 1 to 4. Some form of structure must be there .

Thanks everyone who posted a reply. If there is stuff on my chart I like to know what its all about otherwise whats the point of it being there. I am by far no expert in Forex trading hence my thirst for learning how to gauge where the market is going. I think keeping it simple using support and resistance is key to not getting on the wrong side of the market, as I have done time and time again. Slowly but surely I do less of that thanks to all the great work of traders who take some time out of their day to help guide and support. Really appreciate that.

Expo33 Just one note on your chart for CAD/JPY daily I have just looked at that pair on my chart and noted that my chart is not the same. Zigzag is not plotted the same way and I guess thats is because every broker is different? A is plotted exactly as your chart however on my chart B and C are ignored and the zigzag line goes straight down from A to where your D is. This is where it gets a bit confusing. Perhaps I need to try to plot out the patterns manually?

OFF TOPIC - APOLOGIES  
  
Hey Caledonia,  
If you would like some guidance on how to work out where the market is going then there is no substitute for learning how to actually read charts. Al Brooks has written some excellent material which is heavy going at first, but persevere and you will learn a massive amount in a relatively short space of time. That doesn't mean you will become instantly profitable though! If reading isn't your thing he has produced a great trading course, of which he is gradually bringing the latest update online now. It does cost a bit, but in my opinion it is worth it. If you read the books ( numerous times) AND view the video course(s) you will have more knowledge than many. Then it's just a matter of putting it all together......

salamanda74 Thanks for the heads up. I have found a couple of price action people with videos which I have found very helpful and will certainly have a look at Al Brooks.

If you go to the settings windows and change Depth from 12 to 5 you'll get the same chart. As a rule of thumb for low TF better to use a longer Depth, for high TF a shorter one.

As L.m said, just fiddle with the "extdepth" setting to get the zigzag to match the wave you are tracking. Sometimes I can't get it to match the way I want it too, no problem I just plot it manually and calculate my ABCD manually.  
  
For the CAD/JPY, this is the setting I had. I generally just check 3,6,12,18,24 or whatever works

By the way, plotting charts manually is excellent practice. I didn't use the zig zag for 10 years until I found this modified one with the pips and candles. It just happened to fit my trading strategy perfectly.  
  
Imho, one of the top harmonic traders on here is "CNTrader" and he plots all of his patterns manually

Blue triangle is the sweet zone for potential entry. Rectangles are support/resistance areas

Just tried to fix bugs and better detection of CWW...  
pictures above ,show it at work.  
Logic for detection changed as follow :  
  
if(  
Low[Wolf[1]]<High[Wolf[2]] &&  
Low[Wolf[3]]<High[Wolf[4]] &&  
Low[Wolf[3]]<Low[Wolf[1]] &&  
High[Wolf[4]]<High[Wolf[2]]&&  
((ObjectGetValueByShift(Title+"Line-1-3",Wolf[5])>=Low[Wolf[5]]) && xa>bc)  
)  
{  
WolfWave="Buy";  
}  
  
else if  
(  
High[Wolf[1]]>Low[Wolf[2]] &&  
High[Wolf[3]]>Low[Wolf[4]] &&  
High[Wolf[3]]>High[Wolf[1]] &&  
Low[Wolf[4]]>Low[Wolf[2]] &&

{  
WolfWave="Sell";

Nicely done sir, have done a quick scan with a few pairs and looks like you have nailed it!!!  
Can't wait to try it out real time.  
  
which leads to two questions, how do you establish D(5), do you wait for an indie such as zigzag to draw it or have you calculated   
the theoretical value based on length of AB?  
  
Can you create an alert so we can watch for price action approaching D?  
  
many thanks  
  
Keith

No sir , it does not predict the D(5) point , indeed to be as accurate as it can be in finding the CWW , it wait until all condition including the location of D point (D>=Line_1_3) are satisfied .  
An alert can be implemented ,but it still will alert on touch or break of Line_1_3. by D(5).

Dear Parviz,  
good work, i think thats its a good idea to draw the sweet zone, and may be wold be a good idea to put another option that draw the line 2-4 since point 1, if the price leave the first sweet zone.

This posibility, makes a perfect CWW, and Bill Wolfe some times do that, moves the line 2-4 (sweet zone) to the point 1

I am very sorry , please download again, the previous one does not draw the pattern, if D(5) goes higher than First Sweet Zone, now fixed.  
D(5) now can Extend to the Second Sweet Zone.

Keeps getting better and better!!  
  
Thinking about what has to happen to set up an alert. We can think of the current Price as a moving Point D, which will eventually become fixed or fail.  
  
So in order to anticipate a successful D, we could look for the case where Price has moved say 90 % of the target given by the length of AB in pips.  
  
so when C - Price >90% of A-B, send alert ......" bullish CWW developing"  
and when Price - C > 90% of B -A send alert..... "bearish CWW developing"   
  
Which means price is approaching the sweet zone and we can start to look for a possible trade. I suggest the 90% level as an arbitrary guess, might have to be less, would likely depend on the time frame, shorter time frames might require a different % than longer ones, no idea how to figure that out, might just take experience.  
  
anyway thanks for all of your hard work and let me know if this makes sense to you.

Actually an alert when c-4 is already in place would be greate to catch both movements.

Yes I believe your suggestion is what we need, but you know what happen then ?, then it will draw any pattern with 4 point set and give you all the waves which are not satisfying CWW definition, and many alert erroneously .(D(5) should at least touch or cross Line_1_3 and as our friend said less than Sweet Zone 2)

The best point for alert would be on touch of Line_1_3 ,for CWW to fit its definition.  
And you know what ,the indicator in its current form wait for D(5) to be formed ,i mean as the last highest or lowest point of zigzag wave , and reversal ,before calling it D(5) point. so the logic should be changed too.

I think that you are likely right a touch of the 1-3 line is a safe approach, worst case is price keeps going.  
  
can you code this kind of alert?  
  
thanks

Hi Parviz,  
Your work sounds interesting and I'd be interested in taking a look at the indicator in action. My platform is ProRealTime which uses ProBuilder for coding indicators. I am not a programmer, but if you are able to kindly provide your code in a text file I may get chance to try to understand how to code it in ProBuilder (?)  
  
Thanks

Hi :  
As i said ,i am a novices in both programing and trade, but i learned a lot from this excellent program from Talex who generously and freely shared it.  
i got most of the ideas from reading and trying to understand his codes, he is a genius and, he even has developed his own method of zigzag algorithm ,which became one of the standards . here i share this excellent work ,and hope it will help you as it did for me.

Hi,  
Many thanks but I can't open it as I am not on the metatrader platform - that is why I wondered if the code for the indicator could be copied into a text file.  
No worries and thanks anyway,

It is indeed a text file , only you need to change the file type from (.mq4) to (.txt) to be able to see it with any text editor

Hi mrvgikl :  
Did you noticed this ,D(5) has passed the first sweet zone upper band, and entered the 2nd sweet zone , and before reaching its upper band ,it start to retrace.

No , as soon as pattern is found ,and drawn , a find flag will set and don't search for it any more , if you want to have the latest result , it should be initialized again (go to another time frame and return....).

It should be, otherwise line 1_3 & line 2_4 will not converge. this is CWW as far as i learned .  
But according to the logic i have posted before (and i got them from Wolf book ),you are right, i believe here we may need help from more experienced guys ,Expo ...., others..??

Folks,  
Perfect patterns are hard to come by. In general with trading, close is close enough. There are many occasions in Bill Wolfe's book where he fudges the start point of the pattern to fit by placing it horizontal to point 3 when it actually has no business being there. Maybe it was a case of curve-fitting after the event to show trades that work. To be honest, there are loads of set ups every day that fail so it is a matter of trying to read the chart. I would suggest looking at whatever setup you find and analysing it objectively. Can you see Support or resistance around the area you think the market may reverse (and by the way, apart from using fib retracement / extension tools for a leg 1=leg 2 projection, using Fibs are next to useless. 50% is pretty much the only retracement that has any statistical significance and there are very sound mathematical reasons for that!). The line that the Wolfe Wave generates to give a projected price target is useful in that you can use it to look for obvious support or resistance around that price. Obviously, when looking to see if a Wolfe Wave is worth trading, it is extremely worthwhile looking to see if there are any adverse magnets that will scupper your trade, if you are in the habit of catching falling knives ( and whatever the opposite may be); if the market is heading somewhere it is usually more obvious on the higher time frame charts (H1, H4).  
  
I hope that helps.

Downloaded your indicator parviz1953 . I find this interesting by changing the Ext Depth and using the same time frame. Looking at the middle can see the support on a crossover of the 1 to 4 and 2 to 3 legs on the ext 24 . Two patterns based on different values

> 
> Ignored

Hi Parviz,  
OK the mathematical rationale for a 50% retracement is very simple, but I shall go into a little more detail.  
Risk, reward and PROBABILITY.  
In order for a trade to make mathematical sense the following must be true:  
P(Success)*Reward - P(Failure)*Risk > 0   
Probability is the concept that never gets mentioned when traders talk about a trade. In general they only say 'it's got great risk-reward' and maybe they are right, but only if the probabilities stack up. With any trade, someone (an institution) has to take the other side of it. They are not going to take the other side of your trade if they have a tiny probability of winning, and you trade could be buy OR sell. Therefore, we have to assume that trading survives in a constant fog of probability between say 40 and 60% ie. If you are confident something will happen, then you may have a 60% chance of it occurring. Traders always want Low risk, High probability, massive reward trades. They cannot exist! There are fleeting moments throughout the day when probability may approach 70-80% (I wish I could spot them in time!) but the market quickly moves to close this down and probability once again hovers somewhere around the 50% mark ie 50% probability of moving x ticks before an x tick stop is hit.  
So, lets take a bull case. The market has had a strong bull leg and you are impressed with it; impressed enough to think you want to buy a pullback. The implication is that you feel that the market may be trending and you want to get in on the move. Trending would then imply that you think the market will make a higher high, at least by a small amount. As you think the market is trending and the market tends to keep doing what it has been doing then we can surmise that we have a 60% probability of making a new high. A 50% pullback on the move means that you are midway between where the market is telling you that you need your stop and the high of the move. Therefore it is the point where Risk (R) = Reward (R). So taking probability into account P(success = 0.6)*R - P(Failure = 0.4)*R = 0.2R > 0 so it is mathematically logical to take the trade or as Al Brooks would say 'it has a positive traders' equation'. If we ignore the concept of probability then we can just say that a 50% pullback is the point at which our potential reward is equal to our risk.  
  
Quite long-winded, but I hope that explains it thoroughly.

It's a boring game like " kill your boss ", your boss make you crazy by adding tons of work to you. One day, " one shot in the head and your boss dead - You Won！"  
  
Every time you successfully griped the bottom or top, you will not leave until next N wave appears.

Hi. In the politest possible way, it would be a real shame if the language on this thread deteriorated. I would certainly appreciate it if you respect everyone reading this thread and keep it reasonably professional.

Which version is this ,did you used the latest one ,if it is so ,yes there should be a bug....?!! since this is not classical WW.....??

Dear Parviz1953,  
  
Thanks for the change in the indicator, the general idea is to know how far or near you can be of the sweet zone, or just give the wave as failed. Before giving it for failure my recommendation is to look for it in superior times frames, this is case that you showed before.  
  
It was a failed wave in an inferior time frame and was very far from the second sweet zone, however in a superior time frame there was an almost perfect setup, It is convenient to play with the parameters for different times frames and symbols, for this case were: 14,5,3 (Depht, Deviation and Backstep). GBPUSD have a different swing that EURUSD, etc.  
  
I think your indicator works very well and it would be very convenient to turn it into an expert advisor (EA) to find the rigth setups (the most profitable) by time frame, symbol, time consumed, etc. In dept, deviation .....  
  
Expo33 does well to start working CCW, because it is the easiest to operate, and we should focus effort on those of that kind, other types of Wolfe waves may be more profitable but I agree with Expo33 that CCW is the best for now.  
  
Regards

By my opinion, we can not only take trades on those AB=CD wave, we should give market a tolerance range.

This is a trend trading CWW, i dont think this is a good idea.  
  
Trend is clear means every body will sell....so the trend will reverse in most cases.

The waves that are chained, are not CWW and do not operate like a CWW, there is no reliable 100% pattern, none is, Expo33 proposes this type of pattern and wave because it is the simplest and most reliable, but Sometimes also happens that concatenated waves come out, you have to look for confirmations in higher and lower time frames, as well as smaller waves within the larger ones to have less uncertainty and risk, however just like any other pattern or technique fail even when everything is correct.  
  
Here in this approach I reaffirm my idea, the maximum is at the top of the channel of the second sweet zone, the price is where I feel comfortable if it turns against me, and if it goes well, then there is much to gain for so little investment.  
  
This is the idea Parviz1853

Here are a few charts which will help to explain a Wolfe Wave which happens to be part of a trading idea.  
The first chart is a H1 of EURUSD. We can see the trend line from the 9th was broken on the 29th. We would usually expect a test of the trend extreme after a decent break of the trend line. We got the decent break of the trend line and there has been a reasonable tight bear channel from the trend extreme. At the moment it looks like support has been found at a prior signal bar high (circled) and also on another channel line dating back to the 22nd. This channel line also has the 1,3 and maybe the 5 point on it. The target line for the wave I am talking about is drawn in thick red.

However, we don;t know if the market will reverse back up so I now want to identify a reversal on a lower time frame chart such as the 5min. As we can see, there is another Wolfe Wave possibility on this lower time frame.

At the moment, although we can see a clear channel line across three lows, the last leg down was far too strong to think about going long. I would want to see a stronger break of the steep trend line followed by an attempt at bear trend resumption. I would be looking for a failure of the bear trend resumption at a support level, such as a signal bar high and maybe even a wedge bottom. I would then want a decent bull signal bar after the bulls have shown decent strength and that they may have the ability to take control over the market.

Been trading WWs for years. The secret is that the 'X' must be a new high or low. You can't have an X in mid price obscurity. WWs exist at the bottom and tops of moves and the best ones stand out -you shouldn't need an Indy to spot them!  
  
The target price should, IMHO (and Linda Rache's) be the intersection of the line connecting points 1 & 4 of the wave where this meets the vertical point where the X-B; A-C line convergence joins.  
  
Point 3 must be higher than 1 when looking at WW short and vice versa. The lines must converge to give the 'wedge' pattern 

Trade less and become more profitable!

Hi,  
I'm not sure if your post was directed at me (?) but I am assuming it was. I, too, came across the WW pattern years ago and find it interesting - I don't trade it, but generally look at the target line as a guide as to where the market may be heading. For me, identifying the potential WW is the easy part, and no you don't need whatever an Indy is to spot it, but deciding whether it would be a good bet to trade is the hard part. Looking for reasons why the reversal may actually take place (vs continuation) is the more rewarding aspect. The lower time frame chart I posted was more just to zoom in on the price action, but when I referred to the WW there, the points 1 and 3 are on the line and the target line I inserted crosses below the high of the 4 point because I can see that this was an overshoot of the test of resistance (looking to the left).

I have a question. Tell me for what reason the indicator parvizclassicWW v3 Is not displayed on the chart, but more specifically as several post above in the picture two gold graphics. Perhaps you need an additional indicator or you will be kind enough to provide a kit with a template

So to carry on from my original charts, we have a number of good reasons to enter this reversal and trade the Wolfe Wave.  
The bulls showed the ability to string 3 decent sized bars together whilst breaking the trend line.  
The bears met support and formed a double bottom (thick blue line) whilst at the same time forming a triangle / wedge (thick red line) and also a micro-wedge (thick orange line). The excellent bull signal bar then provided and entry at one tick above with a stop at around 10730. This still may not work out, but there were, in my opinion, sound reasons to take this trade.  
There is an adverse magnet for a measured move down at around 10700 though.

So in Bill Wolfe's book where he outlines 'The Perfect Wave' - where is the new high made at the target price?

I am certainly not attempting to mislead anyone. I make it quite clear that my aim is to spot the WW and look for a number of reasons to trade a reversal on, probably, a lower time frame whilst using the target line to look for support or resistance in that area to aim for. In the process I hope to help people to understand a bit more about price action so that they don't blindly trade (IMHO) meaningless Fib numbers whilst trying to catch falling knives.   
Constructive posts are, in general, more helpful.

"where is the new high made at the target price?"  
  
I was not talking about that but about your wrong wolfe wave examples, the target is up to debate of course and up to everyone, which is actually the hardest part, where is the best taking profit level, as in any pattern/strategy/system.  
  
I have no doubt that your participation is of a good intention but your are just wrong, you should read more of this thread and step back on your posting because most of it are not good examples.  
  
I am sure your attempt was not to mislead anyone, I am just saying that you are doing so because you do not fully understand the so said pattern.

I was not talking about that but about your wrong wolfe wave examples, the target is up to debate of course and up to everyone, which is actually the hardest part, where is the best taking profit level, as in any pattern/strategy/system. I have no doubt that your participation is of a good intention but your are just wrong, you should read more of this thread and step back on your posting because most of it are not good examples.

LDFX,  
Please point out, in the Wolfe Wave I posted above (Post 601), what you feel is wrong with it and let's have a constructive discussion. I am perfectly happy to admit I am wrong if it transpires that I am.  
  
Many thanks  
  
Edit: Actually, I do understand that that is not a good example and I admit that you are correct on this occasion. The length of the legs are not particularly symmetrical.

It is ok - I have edited the post above and I have conceded that, on this occasion, you have a point and are correct!

Ok, first of all is the 4th point you called, it is not a wave, it is just nothing compared to the 1-2 and 2-3 wave, it is just noise.  
  
However the chart you showed is luckily clean, we can clearly see the beginning of an ABC retracement pattern with usually a wolfe wave pattern in it, I can just see the first leg, XA or A, then on zooming in you are showing an invalid wolfe wave because it is an expanding channel rather than a wedge, I can see there is an AB=CD pattern in terms of levels but not in time, the downward momentum is clearly strong, put a channel on it as an indicator and you will see.

As I said above, I have conceded that you are correct.  
  
I do disagree about your 'noise' comment as I don't think that the market makes noise. There is generally a reason for price movements even if we don't understand what those reasons are - just my opinion.  
  
OK, I will try to be more careful about what I call Wolfe Waves in future.   
  
I am more interested in the price action so if I see something that I feel can help others during a potential reversal I will try to explain it as I am enthusiastic about understanding what charts are telling us. When I see the general pattern that I outlined in post 601 I will look for reasons to trade a reversal, but you are correct - it is not a Wolfe Wave. However, these patterns do often give a reversal trader something to think about.  
All the best and thank you for the constructive discussion.

Is it a matter of being right ?  
  
You talked about constructive post and I tried my best about trying to correct you in the wolfe wave pattern.  
  
The noise I was talking about was relative to the 1-2 and 2-3 wave as it was maybe 15% on it size, it is then noise relative to it.  
  
And how would have been your risk vs reward with such a small profit target ? Noise is what it was.  
  
The market makes noises all the time, pulling out mirages in front of you, the key is to see the noises, AKA the insignificant moves that takes place, and to filter them, otherwise you will see patterns everywhere as your example in post 601.  
  
By the way, how has been the trade of the post 601 ?

LDFX,  
It sounds like you are looking for a fight!  
'Noise' to me is generally what people call price movements when they can see no reason for what is going on so if you were referring to noise as a comparison to the prior wave then fine - it is not the terminology that I would use, but I hear what you are saying.  
  
As I said at the start of post 601, my reason for looking for the reversal up was to have a test of the trend high or at least the trend line that was broken so actually the potential reward for the trade idea was very large - my target is 10804 - 10812 if you want figures. Just because there is a target line there does not mean the market will stop there.  
  
Are you asking how the trade is doing because you don't have charts and cannot check yourself or are you asking to try to make me look silly? Depending on how one manages one's trades one will not lose money on the trade I outlined. Everyone manages trades differently and one could have removed half at 1x risk with a view of swinging the rest, or one could wait for 3 or 4 consecutive bear bars and decide that the market was flipping and exit at the market. Or, one can just rely on one's stop and accept that you win some, you lose some.

Exactly dude is what happened on your post 601, an irrelevant price move to qualify for a wolf wave pattern.  
  
Haha, so the result of the trade in post 601 would make you look silly ? I am wondering why...

Well, it is the beginning of a wolfe wave, the set up is still correct, also the AB=CD would end up at a resistance level, it is a valid pattern to watch.  
  
It is actually 2 wolfe waves in it, so even better.  
  
Filtering the patterns with confluence is way better than any indicators.

ok, 1 hour.  
  
You have the last leg of a wolf wave pattern unfolding in a "might be" wolfe wave, so all good, watch it closely and act if seeing selling pressure.  
  
At point D it might be the point D of a smaller pattern, confluence is a great filter and is a needed boost of confidence in this ever facing uncertainty that is the market.  
  
I am in already for a short.

I'm watching too and to me it seems good, 1-3 and 2-4 converging, 1 between 3 and 4.

Yes, so far it is a valid wolf wave pattern to anticipate.

Open post to all readers,  
If I have in any way mislead you with any of the pattern I have posted then for that I apologise.  
  
Bill Wolfe prints many patterns in his book and many of them are not the perfect pattern with the leg1= leg2 and some of the 3-4-5 waves are extremely small (noise apparently) compared to the prior 1-2-3 wave. Even the less convergent patterns make an appearance in Bill Wolfe's book. I will refrain from giving screenshots of the actual examples here, but they are readily available in the book that Expo kindly attached at the start of this thread.  
  
Having been berated by LDFX for daring to post examples of these less than perfect patterns I was then ridiculed by the same for taking a perfectly acceptable reversal trade which turned out to be a loser. As that is unacceptable behaviour in my book then I see no reason to continue posting here unless anyone actually asks me to carry on by way of a public post. My aim is to provide a different angle based on reading charts and putting a decent argument together for a trade. I have provided examples of some excellent trades on here, some of which have led to large profits. I shall continue to watch the forum, but for now I will refrain from posting unless specifically asked to carry on.  
  
Good luck to all of you traders out there!

You tell you want to help others, and I believe you, but I think you're doing the wrong way and maybe in the wrong place as well.  
  
There are some points in your posts that I didn't like but everyone can think in a different way so I will focus just on two things that make me think what I wrote before. You said you don't trade WW and you don't believe in fibos and in fact in your analysis there are no fibos and WW are just the last confirmation of other studies that make you decide to trade or not.  
So my question is, do you really think to have the right attitude/behavior? You're going against what this thread is about and now you feel offended because someone made you notice that maybe you're doing wrong. If you want to help others I think you should be less egocentric.  
Don't feel offended please, I don't mean to offend anybody.

Hi all :  
this is the same Tf and pair as my previous post, although it lacks one of the conditions of CWW(B is lower than X), if you are higher time frame trader like me, profit was good , it has already moved 200 pips and i believe, it will still move between 100 to 300 pips more.

Hi L.m,  
Thank you for your feedback. No offence has been taken.  
Just to clarify a couple of points.....I do look at Wolfe Waves and use them to look for reversal trades and I use a Fib tool sometimes to look for Leg 1 =Leg 2 moves. I have posted some charts with the Fib levels on them purely for seeing where a leg 1 = leg 2 would be. The reason I have no real time for Fibs is that the market movement is basically controlled by computers. If more computers / money think that resistance is at point A than point B then the market will turn at Point A. This is purely my opinion, but I very much doubt whether the computers have 'look for a 161% Fib extension and place a trade' algorithm. Maybe I am wrong. If someone could explain a mathematical rationale for Fibs working in the market and back it up with some decent evidence then I am willing to be convinced otherwise. Until then I will just use good old support and resistance. Adam Grimes has done quite a bit of statistical analysis on Fib levels and he could find no evidence for Fibs working.   
  
The main reason I was frustrated is that some of my charts are not perfect examples of Wolfe Waves, but they are a type of Wolfe Wave as I understand it from reading Bill Wolfe's book. The charts below are taken directly from the Wolfe book. I have conceded that some of my charts are not brilliant examples in terms of symmetry, but in terms of looking for reversals they are not too dissimilar to those posted below. So I have not sought to mislead anyone and I do genuinely seek to help. When I was laughed at for a trade not going as hoped and being breakeven rather than a winner, I decided that there was no point posting any more when there is childish behavior like that directed at me. I am not prepared to tolerate that and have better things to do with my time. Once again, thank you for your feedback and all the best.

Agree - we are not trying to 'berate' anyone; just point people in the right direction. You need to learn this stuff over years. See attached example for clarity.  
  
In short, don't look and try to curve-fit patterns to charts where WW or any price action doesn't exist!  
  
Look for a rising / falling wedge. Then apply the basic WW 'rules'. Draw your lines. 3 and 5 must be higher than 1. 4 must be higher than 2. The wedge lines MUST converge in the future. Await price action at point 5 before selling. Use support levels or ATR targets to set limit orders, or whatever MM you use. Simples.  
  
See attached example on USDCHF that I traded and tweeted about.

sorry sir. I do respect your post cause you've been trading with WW for years.  
  
But i completely don't understand what you are drawing on the pic  
  
This is a CWW by my view.

About the fibos, maybe you're right or maybe they're just like other S/R levels, sometimes they work sometimes they don't and it's up to each trader find a profitable way to use them.  
About WW, the structure is always the same. What Wolfe sometimes does is to "manage" point 1 in order to get the structure he wants. I don't like it of course because this is the typical way to make things happen.  
  
In your charts sometimes it's hard for me to see the waves, I'd appreciate if you put the numbers on to help me get what you're saying. Thanks  
  
What Expo33 says instead is that the convergence is not always necessary, and I agree with him but I also agree with his aim to focus only on the classical patterns at the beginning, because overtrading is one of the usual mistakes newbies make.  
  
In one of your previous posts you talked about filtering bad trades, maybe it would be more useful to show some live patterns you decide not to take. I say live, because human brain needs to find the reasons why things happen and one of the most difficult aspects (always underestimated) is to avoid creating false reasons. A trade can fail just because they can't be all good trades. Overthinking like overtrading is a big issue.  
  
I wish you and everybody many green pips.

Please see Grimweasel's post 632 above for an excellent description of how wedges function and how he views them as Wolfe waves.

I doubt it.  
  
As more of a price action trader I do trade wedges, but before reading Grimweasel's post above, I would not have classed them strictly as Wolfe Waves. However, I bow to his greater experience at trading Wolfe Waves.

This was indeed a real wolfe wave, the 5th wave exactly reversed at the 1-3 trend line in a wedge formation, hope you get rewarded, anyway you did at least brake even thanks to the bounce ?

Hi buddy,  
  
actually the AB=CD pattern is a filter that Expo33 came by with but is not necessary to fulfill the wolf wave pattern.  
  
Confluence of course helps.

Hi sir :  
I believe that now we are limiting ourselves with wedge concept to an occasions where the D or the 5th wave is just touching the line 1-3, and only the lower border of so called Sweet Zone, as far as i have learned, the definition of CWW include not only these cases, but also those which extend into the S.Zone, and not only that but as our friend mentioned earlier wolfe even included those 5th point which penetrate, what has been called 2nd S.zone.  
what you are saying does not include all cases which is, by definition, a true CWW.

Please refer to wolfe textbook , and you can see what, i named it as the 2nd sweet zone ,post #563 has the original graph, and post#564 which was my responce , indeed it is a zone starting from point 1 , (instead of 3 in definition of sweet zone), and parallel to line 2_4 .

You know what it is in reality, it is when the waves continue to form, the third point in a typical Elliot's wave channel , and there it reverse to form the 4th one, and this was why i accepted it ,since the reversal can happen there too, based on both of definition .

Hi man,  
  
thanks for your examples.  
  
It is basically a ABC elliot wave pattern.  
  
And is the maximum area for a wolf wave.  
  
I actually was aware of it and misinterpreted it.

You see, great, 3 wins one loss but only 2 wolfe wave patterns in 4, maybe.  
  
It might have been patterns but not wolfe wave pattern, well, perhaps screenshot 2 and 3..., perhaps.

Dear Kminler,expo & All:  
During the last 2 weeks i have tried to develop this version of indictor which can predict a Potential CWW when it is forming, I m aware that it is not still bug free, (has some false positive ones, which of course, is easily differentiable visually ), it has an alert on finding which can be set too.  
Please i am looking forward for your comments or any suggestion, even for any logic to improve the detection, and prevent false ones, be kind and let me have them.

The latest one always . Finding the completed CWW part, is nearly bug free, the newest addition, which is predication and finding the potential CWW, has of course some bugs that i am aware of, and trying to find and fix them.  
Indeed one of them was found and fixed already, and as soon as i check it on different pair and TF, and satisfied, i am going to post it.

Thanks again for all your hard work, I have the indie running on some smaller time frames in hopes of generating test signal for the alert feature.  
so far it does not appear to be working, had a valid signal on the GBPUSD, but no pop up alert.  
  
I assume that the alert would remain open until I manually closed It? I run 4 monitors so it is possible that the alert is hidden behind an open window on another screen, though I think it should pop into view no matter what.  
  
the trade that was spotted was valid and a winnner.  
  
I will keep monitoring and keep you posted.

Hi sir:  
1)If the indicator find any pattern, then it sets a find flag , make an alert, and stop searching, so if you already have a pattern found and drawn on your chart, its not going to do it again.  
2) With so many rules that need to be true for the curve to be acceptable as a valid CWW, it may take a while before it forms if ever.  
3) Don't forget that in a time frame while ,one setting (ExtDepth of 6), may not find any, others(ExtDepth of 3 or 12) may.  
4) As i said before it is best when used as a scanning tool, put it on a pair , go through different TF , and if you find an interesting and valid CWW then make a note and follow it closely.  
By the way check the input for setting and set alert to true, if not done before, and if it find any it is going to give you repeated alarm on every new Bar of that TF,so if it is on M15 it will alert every 15 minute.  
Edited: Please Download and use this one, some bugs fixed :

EURUSD - H1 Wolfe Wave maybe setting up so one to track  
  
Price currently approaching at least 2 support areas in terms of the signal bar high from the 15th (see large elipse) and a bull trend line throughout the chart.  
The rectangle shows price action maybe setting up a Wolfe Wave within.  
The small circle shows an approximate 20 point gap that occurred late on in this particular bear trend after numerous sell climaxes. Whilst it is possible that it is a measuring gap it is more likely to be an exhaustion gap that will be filled soon so gives additional reasons to take a chance on a decent bull reversal setup if one appears. Also, there has been no test of the prior trend high as yet after the trend line break to the downside. Just my thoughts and I'm sure others will disagree!

Hey Parviz  
  
You the man!! Downloaded the latest version and alert working perfectly, also all the overnight patterns were valid and winners!  
  
Currently have an alert on the CADJPY 15 min.  
  
I'd post a chart but when I use Ctrl V, it wants to upload all the monitors not just the chart I want to display. Anyone know another method to upload a chart so that it displays in the message window and not just as a file to be opened?  
  
Thanks

Hi all:  
Please check this picture, it has some interesting finding:  
1)it was a potential CWW which, has now reached its completion target.  
2) AB=CD and, interstingly ,D(5) has past the 1st Sweet Zone, and entered into the 2nd one.  
3)If it reverse now, it would be a very good chance for a profitable trade, with very good R/R ratio.

Hello Wolfe wavers!!  
  
I'm back from my 10,000 mile vacation journey. Had a fantastic time but am happy to be back home. Lots of work to catch up on around the house and the community.   
  
Thanks to all of you who have kept this thread alive. Looks like there has been some really productive discussions. I'm looking forward to reading through all of the new posts. I haven't looked at a chart in nearly 10 days but am eager to get back into action.  
  
Cheers and good trading

Thanks.   
  
I put a note on the first post that I was going to be gone for 10 days on a cruise to Mexico. I promised the family that I wouldn't look at a chart or do any trading while we were on vacation.  
  
Anyways, thank you for all of your hard work. The indicator you are modifying is becoming a very powerful and useful tool for many of the traders here. Imo, by far the best WW indicator I have seen.  
  
I am looking forward to using it on some charts as time permits. Will be very busy for a few days catching up on domestic things though.  
  
Cheers

Thanks for your indi, it's very useful to quickly scroll the pairs and TF. I think the patterns need to be checked before opening any trade. Since it's based on zigzag it depends by its settings whether the pattern is correct or not.  
  
According to Wolfe, between X(1) and B(3) there can't be another swing low (swing high for rising patterns) so the one in your picture is not a real WW pattern. I've seen others and it was something I wanted to point out, sorry to be late.  
  
I don't think it's possible to solve this issue, just need to check the patterns. But there's a second point I would like to talk about and take the occasion since Expo is here again (welcome back Expo) because I would like to know what he thinks about it. Point X(1) according to the original rules should be between B(3) and C(4) and to me it's an important rule (not included but easy to add in your indi) because if point C(4) fails to clearly break point X(1) it means the trend is strong and the reverse may take longer before to begin.

Thanks a lot for your good suggestion, i am really disappointed, that others did not give me any feedback.  
Both points you mentioned are well taken, as you said yourself, regarding the first one, i really have no idea how it can be implemented, but i will think and work on that, your second point as you say is easily applicable.  
Thanks again for your precious comments .

It's a pleasure, you are doing the hard work.  
I was thinking about the first "issue". Maybe you could add a filter based on the close price of the candles between 2 points of the pattern, but I'm not a coder and I don't know how to help.  
However I'd expect for Expo to tell what he thinks about these things. Another option is to leave as it is, not to filter too much and then it's up to each of us to make some judgement on the detected patterns.

Exactly ,indeed whenever i try to add a new rule to the logic, then it will draw so few pattern that you don't get a chance yourself to decide and have control. Let it be a challenge for the traders too..![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60e.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f607.png?v=15.1).   
But really it is best used for quick scanning of several pairs and time frame, don't relay on it for real trade, traders should decide themselves.

Here it is, your 2nd rule applied, it is not bad at all , indeed the pattern seems more logical and beautiful.  
PS: I have changed the long name to a simpler one, but still Version is correct and is v4.

Hi all:  
This is Version 5, new features has been added, now you might select the ExtDepth and the Type of CWW, on the screen by clicking the buttons, after new selection it will takes a while, since it is recalculating all data with new ExtDepth, be patient....  
I hope you like it....![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f64f.png?v=15.1)

The whole block of text and button will be moved together, when you set the x and y axis in the input...!!

Thanks:  
I was aware of this bug myself , so I was looking for a better one, now the new standard zigzag indicator logic which is provided by MT4 itself was chosen and used.  
I hope that the bug is fixed now, I myself did not find it any more....  
And in this version also, you can choose your own set of six different ExtDepth values, if you don't like the default ones.

EDITED:  
  
Unfortunately the problem was not solved ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f613.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f634.png?v=15.1), i believe it was in the logic of recounting only those Bars which are new, in all type of indicator to speed up the calculation,  
Since i have to recount and recalculate all of the Bars again every time we change a parameter like previous ExtDepth, I have to erase all the values in the buffer, to make a new valid zigzag, I have to change the code again a little bit.  
To make the story short, the worst drawback, is slower indicator then, so please be patient when you change these parameter....

Dear jonirrenicus:  
unfortunately I can not use any of your figures and ideas , because it lacks which pair and which time frame you are talking about.

Hi All:  
Somebody before has asked me about wether my indicator is repainting or not? and i said not.  
Now Let me elaborate more on this issue technically :  
When the indicator find and draw a valid, either a potential or a completed CWW, then as i said it set a found flag and stop repainting it, but the program is still running and on formation of every new ZigZag high or low ,it look to see if it is a new valid one according to the definition of CWW, and if it does then it will repaint again.  
I hope this explanation would be of help regarding this important question.

Hi everybody,  
  
There is my charts with WW setup I think ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Can you confirm that I'm on the good way or not please ?  
  
**_An other question :_** If the AB=CD completion is between two Fibo's levels ( 161 & 200 for example) do you think this is a good entry area or do you entry only in AB=CD=Fibo's levels ?

Very interestingly now, the indicator draw the same chart CWW as a completed CWW. I Believe it would be a profitable buy opportunity and a very good R/R ratio, if you put the SL just below the green line of the 2nd S.zone and TP somewhere above the A_C Line. This will give you a goal of >50 pips

And if you follow this in the Daily chart then there you see a potential CWW, just forming, and the D(5) will Complete this one, somewhere around above 300 pips of profit before it retrace, which i estimate it may take a week or two before it happens.

So soon you will find a good chance of BUY, and taking profit on several steps (50 pips..,......,>300 pips), depending which TF you like to trade on.

OK now I am seeing that reversal has already started, and this figure shows how i am going to enter the market step wise, i already bought a 0.1 lot and i have a buy stops just above every of the .23, .382, .50, .618 fibo levels with 0.3 lot as pyramiding trades.  
I am crossing my fingers, Hopefully the prediction of future price movement will come true.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f607.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f607.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f64f.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f64f.png?v=15.1)

Also notice that the AB/CD ratio is 144%, and that D(5), has just past the 2nd S.Zone even, until it formed a new pivot point. May be confluence is playing a role here, (coincidence of the daily potential CWW, C(4)point, and this D(5), of the completed M30 CWW, on different TF). Or may be then it is not a typical CWW and it fits the definition of what is called "Bullish Alt AB=CD Pattern".  
Please, please i ask, from those experienced trader and Expo to participate and give their comments on this topics. Don't let this forum to fade gradually in dark of silence, and let us all learn from each other.

I am very sorry sir, ya that is true, indeed this is a special edition that i kept for myself....![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f602.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f602.png?v=15.1).  
No really the truth is that:  
When the D(5) point passes the line from point X(1) and parallel to A(2)_C(4),(the last allowable boundary of 2nd Sweet Zone) the indicator does not accept it as a valid CWW.  
In this version of mine (which i did not dare to put on the forum, since it was misleading), lets this to happen, this is just experimental version, so i kept it to myself.

Just for comparison: This is the Elltiot's wave counterpart of the same Daily EURUSD Chart.

I believe that if the price comes 20 pips more down and it reaches the 4th point, then on reversal, D(5) will not enter the sweet zone, and it is no more CWW, then it is going to form somewhere before reaching it, making Elliot's 5th point and reverse, to make the rest of it (the A,B,C part of the wave).  
And here is the two type of waves superimposed, to see the difference:

It has been standardizd , AB should be equal to CD+/- 10% at most, other than that it is either not a CWW, or a Failed one.  
Don't forget that at its best, CWW does only gives 60-70% success rate, which is in real world, a lot better than, 50% chance of a coin flip.

>

**Hi everybody:**  
Let me confess that i did not know anything about the CWW, before entering and reading this forum, a generous and excellent work of Expo,.  
Now after a deep dive into the definition and its characteristics and coding an indicator for it, I want to define what a CWW is in my humble opinion and as I understand it:  
**1)** CWW is a variant (mutant) form of Elliot's wave, which has been very well defined by the great job of Mr Wolfe, and works as good as it's decent father.  
  
**2)** It start one extremum of price moves later than Elliot's waves, (X point of it is indeed 1st point of the Elliot's).So a bullish Elliot's wave is a bearish Wolfe wave (look at the superimposed picture of my last post).  
  
**3)** While in Elliot's Wave, all believe that the best point to enter the market is at the beginning of the formation of 3rd wave(the impulsive 3rd wave), wolfe wave trader are advised to enter the market on the completion of the D(5) point, which is indeed, upon completion of the 5th wave and beginning of the retracement Waves of Elliot's (at the beginning of its ABC wave formation).  
  
**4)** So, while trades of Elliot's wave follower start **"with the trend"** at the completion of 2nd point, wolfe's trader wait till trend is finished and its retracement start(**"Anti_trend trading",** beginning at its well defined, best selected point of it ,the "Sweet Zone").  
  
I am looking forward for any comments that teach me, if i am wrong in any parts, or overlooked any details.  
Dear expo please mentor me, if i am wrong.

As I stated previously, not always, but CWWs are often the end points of larger harmonic structures, including Eliiot waves.  
  
However, I can't comment on Elliot waves specifically as I haven't really studied them in depth. I think there have been some knowledgeable EW posters here that have made some very good points on this subject.

Amazing work you have done parviz. As I said this indicator is the "creme de la creme" of WW indicators. Bravo and thank you so much!  
  
I now it's probably is a massive amount of work, but is there any way the inputs can be set up to allow the user to modify the colors, line thickness, etc etc. Without having the code, it seems the only thing that can be modified on the wave structure is the triangle color.

Thanks a lot sir:  
I am really happy that you liked it, the triangle color can be set, but the line thickness is not. If you think it is necessary to have it, that can be added easily.please, explain, and itemize all the inputs that you think should be added, i will implement them in the next update .(you know, more than 20 different objects are created on the chart when program draw a pattern, each with a line thickness, color and position , how do you believe i should categorize them. (for example, for lines i used 3 different color to be separable promptly, for fibo relations and triangle one, and for buttons two )

You're welcome Parviz.  
  
I feel bad even asking. My eyes are very sensitive to certain color patterns, hence why I use the black template. For me, I would love to be able to modify every input so I can create a personal color scheme as my default (pretty selfish I know) : zig zag, trend lines, extension lines, target line, pretty mush every element of the structure in your indicator.   
  
If not, no problem. I don't want you to have to work any harder than you already have.  
  
Cheers,

GBPUSD  
  
I suggest we should look for trades only on TF no less than H1.  
  
I get this point from a very successful fund manager on a lecture.

Yes it does, when we find a WW, it has higher successful rate if we pull the trigger on SR.  
  
BTW, Your indi become much smarter than last version....it can scan for good set up 70% of the time.  
  
CWW with 2nd entries

I Believe it would be a profitable buy opportunity and a very good R/R ratio, if you put the SL just below the green line of the 2nd S.zone and TP somewhere above the A_C Line. This will give you a goal of >50 pips {image} And if you follow this in the Daily chart then there you see a potential CWW, just forming, and the D(5) will Complete this one, somewhere around above 300 pips of profit before it retrace, which i estimate it may take a week or two before...

Hard to tell as I am viewing from my phone but it looks like XB and AC are not converging.

If you go back through my post, you will see that once, it has been suggested that for a Valid CWW the X(1) should be located between B(3) and C(4) ,so i have added this to the logic of CWW. In your picture X is higher than C

Exactly, if X was lower than C then the two line were convergent.

I think TPs really depend on the individual's risk profile but in post #1 I posted a generic TP diagram that I use for higher timeframe trades that have multiple scaled in positions.

Hi :  
The pictures that you share, lacks the information about pair name, and timeframe, even we have no idea in this picture , what is the ExtDepth of the zigzag.  
Anyhow to me none of them can make a valid CWW, but interestingly you see a very nice classic a bearish Head & Shoulder pattern .

For now the orders are still active.   
  
However, the longer this D leg drags out, the worse the symmetry becomes between AB and CD. There will always be differing viewpoints (which is a good thing) as to when a wave becomes invalid. Obviously there is going to be quite a bit of subjectivity when it comes to trading the WW. If it doesn't play out soon, I may just scrap the set up. There are always plenty of other opportunities.  
  
Cheers

Finally have had a chance to put in some screen time and use your indicator. I am truly grateful and impressed. The indicator is so versatile too. Really a great work!

What do you want to know about it, D(5) has passed the sweet zone and entered what i was calling 2nd sweet zone, if you go back over my previous post, there was a lot of discussion about it. You want to consider it as a valid CWW or not, that is your choice, i have let the user to decide .

Activated 2 positions manually on the GBP/JPY 4HOUR.  
  
Interesting to see a smaller WW on the hourly. I think this scenario adds a nice layer of confluence to the trade. However, with all of the geopolitical risk in the air, the next bomb to drop could easily blow this trade up.

Thanks it now can detect more than 70% of the good set up!  
  
One more thing, if you have time could you pls. remove the zigzag line? because we already have zigzagpips indi on the chart...  
  
or may be you can combine zigzag pips with this indi, so we don't need zigzag pips indi anymore...

My buy orders have been waiting all the way down to 136.13 with stops below 136 per my previous post on the 4H CWW set up. Symmetry isn't great but the wave is valid and now my orders are being fillled

Post #753 shows the TPs. I tend to micro manage trades that go in my favor.

All positions have been filled. GBP data has been very good lately but geopolitical tensions have pushed GJ down. Imho, very good risk reward at the current price level. Any type of positive communication involving N. Korea, US, China, or Russia could send GJ back north. In the meantime, will rely on the CWW structure and let the trade run over the weekend. Right now, GJ hovering right at the AB=CD completion level 136.13  
  
Not Wolfe wave related but EUR/JPY and GBP/JPY share a strong positive correlation. At the moment, EUR/JPY price is coming into what I term an "energy zone" on the daily. It will be interesting heading into next week to see if this zone repels price or if it accelerates through and goes lower.  
  
EUR/JPY DAILY ENERGY ZONE - When price, time, and space meet!

Your welcome. Thanks for posting and using the template.  
  
Not the greatest symmetry but certainly a valid WW. Interesting to note that the AB=CD completion level is 81.17 which is the 161FIB extension to the pip, so scaling in down to that point with small positions would seem like a decent option. Also, several other JPY pairs are reaching important support levels. Next week will be very interesting.

Hi All, thank you for a great thread,  
and hats off to Parvis for his coding.  
I would like to share a few things that have dropped into place  
while following the thread.  
For me, they are very [VERY] significant.  
First you would need to take a look at the attached pics.  
They represent the Harmonic Elliott Wave [HEW] Impulse Wave Count,  
in 5 waves [(i) to (v)].  
To keep it simple, I have added the 1 to 5 basic Wolfe Wave Count.  
Also, each and every Wave a and Wave c is a HEW 5 wave Impulse Wave.  
Now, that's a lot of 5 wave HEW 5 wave Impulse Waves!  
And, that's a lot of Wolfe Waves that end each HEW Impulse Wave.  
Virtually an endless supply!  
Not only that, the Wave b corrections also contain HEW 5 wave Impulse Waves.  
They can be very complicated,  
but we already know how complicated corrections can be!  
The Wave ii's and iv's also contain 5 wave Impulse Waves.  
Cheers, U2

Thanks for posting U2.  
  
Nice explanation and diagram. This will be very helpful to me and many others!

Hi Uturn:  
Thank a lot for you kind complement.  
I believe you are making a mistake, when you were naming the CWW counterpart of the HEW, i believe you must start counting one wave later, please refer to my **post#704,** to see what i mean.  
in confirmation of what i said, consider also that for a CWW to be valid X(1) need to be between point B(3) , and C(4).  
the third point that i want to mention is that as you said there are a lot of different level of CWW as HEW, and it depends on how you define the ExtDepth of the zigzag indicator ,which gives you larger or smaller high and lows and peak and lawn.  
a valid CWW has a strict rules that as a reminder i write it again here for information of all:  
  
  
**Buy Wolf wave:**  
  

Low[b]<High[C] &&  

High[C]<High[A]&&  
(slope1_3<=slope2_4)&&  
D(5) should touch or pass Line1_3&&  
D(5) should not pass the boundary of 2nd sweet zone  
  
And you can think , the same form of logic is there, for detection of a Sell Wolfe wave.  
  
  
EDITED:  
And the last point:

>

Wolfe waves are not impulsive wave of HEW, but indeed the retracement wave of it. And this is why CWW lags one wave later on HEW, as i mentioned earlier.

Hi All:  
In this new version, i have added some new features, which i believe, would be very helpful.  
1) Now you may put, fibo on any line segment of the wave as you wish, and clear it whenever you want, each of the button act as toggle . you may have two or more fibos at the same time.  
2) The other one is "SAVE PATTERN" button, by clicking on it an image of the current pattern is saved on the chart, so that you may move between different TF, and compare it in with other TF pattern or if a new pattern comes in it is not gonna be lost.(if at any time you don't want to have it , go to the object list and remove the objects with time and date stamped in their name, or rerun your template).

I hope you enjoy it as I do....  
  
  
PS: By the way i am still not completely sure it is bug free, if you find one, please let me know to fix it.  
  
EDITED: Oh , forgot to mention you may change the color of fibo levels and text related to fibo in the input now.

I feel guilty for even asking but I couldn't really figure out where to change the thick lines to dotted lines with the colors that match my template. Even if I could, it wouldn't help anyways because I have the older code without the new modifications.  
  
I'm sure I could figure out where to just change the colors everywhere I found them in the code to the template colors but I noticed width=2 for the different lines so I don't know what would denote a dotted line. Any suggestions? Heck, I'd be willing to pay to have it done $$![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60e.png?v=15.1)$$

if you just tell me the line thickness and different color for each of the lines that you want for your template, i will change it for you the way you like it, free of any charge, this is my hobby as i said before, i enjoy coding, i am 64 years old ,retired and wealthy enough....

Incredibly generous of you Parviz. Ok here goes....  
  
Zig Zag line: Magenta - solid line of minimum thickness  
  
X(1),A(1),B(2),C(3),D(4): Yellow  
  
XC target line: MediumSeaGreen - dotted line  
  
XB line: Crimson - dotted line  
  
AC line and both extension lines from points X and B: Yellow - dotted line  
  
All of the percentages Yellow  
  
I think thats about it, please let me know if that make sense.  
  
Again, so much thanks for your contribution and work here.  
  
-Kurt  
  
Just to visualize it, here is the template.  
  
Note: The dotted DodgerBlue line is the AB=CD completion level. I always like to put it on the chart so I can easily look back for previous areas of S/R. I know it's not part of the indicator as it stands, just had it on the chart as a matter of habit

Have a look at this one too, GBPJPY, H1 , a completed CWW with AB=CD, with the setting of 20 (ExtDepth)...

Strongly agreed!  
  
1 NO red news for G/J for next few days  
  
2 Fibo run out...  
  
3 shape perfect!

It is really coded in a very hard way, and does not have any comments, but anyhow try this if it would be of any help:  
  
double ZigZag2[100];  
double LastOne2[2];  
int i=0;  
double Temp=0;  
  
for(int Count=0;Count<=99;Count++)  
{  
Temp=iCustom(NULL,0,"ZigZag",12,5,3,0,Count)  
if(Temp != EMPTY_VALUE)  
{  
LastOne2[i]=Temp;  
i++;  
}  
}

No success with mt4. It must fall outside the CWW parameters.

Long term, I'm seeing the resumption of the uptrend.  
Once I see a base in place I can measure from there.  
I need a Wave i and Wave ii for this.  
[HEW not WW]  
Also happy to count the waves and trade it up to the WW 1-4 line.  
This would see it up to ~113?  
Edit: I would also like to see DX reverse [to Long].  
Cheers, U2 

Wait, or you will be slaughtered!

May be i should define a zone for that, rather than a fixed values??, eg. within 5-10% lower than B(3) or Higher than C(4), be accepted valid??

Thanks, bro for the indicator. It becomes already interesting.  
Remarks:  
1\. When I switch timefreym, the ZZ parameter go from 20 to 6 (ExtDepth).  
2\. To reduce the text size on buttons (ExtDepth).  
3\. To make a choice of color of buttons (ExtDepth) and the choice of color of the letters XABCD separately.

Hi:  
1) Changing timeframe reinitialize the indicator, so it goes to it default values.  
2)I rather have the largest possible font size that fits within the button boundary.  
3)It is indeed combination of 3 color, ON state, OFF state and the text color, if i add these ones too, the input panel will be too crowded, even more than now.  
4) please give me ideas on changing the logic, or anything that can improve the detection of CWW, or how to get more pips.....![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60e.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)  
not anymore about the appearance of it.  
  
PS:  
By the way, the 2nd value in the input list of ExtDepth, is the default value, if you change it to 20, you will always have that button at the start.

Bravo Parviz! Thank you  
  
A couple of questions:  
  
1) Is there an easy way to replace the zigzag you are using and replace it with the one that shows the "pips/candles" like the one I have on the post#1 template, or will that mess up the way the indicator is works?  
  
2) If so, is there a way to re-position the X(1) A(2)......values so they are directly above/below the zigzag point enough distance so one can see the pip/candle values?  
  
I can always change the "extdepth" on the ZigZag that shows the pips/candles to match whatever the value is on your indicator to match the particular set up, but still can't see the values very well

1)I should read its code to see how it would be possible.  
2)Each item on the chart has a time and a price dimension, price axis scale change exponentially, so ten pip higher on higher places on chart is equal sometimes to 100 pips in some places lower on the same chart so with different price variation on different charts the location of the X,A,B,C,D text will change, so i decided to put it right were the price is and only shift the time value to the right, for location to be fixed, for all kind of price movement within the visible chart area.  
3)Let me read zigzag code, i may find a way and tell you what to change in the code, to relocate those numbers.

I respectfully disagree.  
  
On a daily chart we may be talking anywhere from 20-100 pips or more for 5-10%. Lower lows, higher highs was the original principle behind the WW. However, Bill Wolfe did show examples where the XB line was horizontal (the parallel WW which probably should be called the horizontal WW)  
  
Point being, this may be a Pandora's box. Where does it end? Why not 12%, etc ,etc. Especially considering any new traders that may be starting their new WW journey. Just more confusion if they have perused the other free online resources related to WWs.  
  
Maybe it's best for traders to just draw the wave manually if they want to stretch the parameters in this way.  
  
Just my thoughts  
  
And just so I understand what is being proposed. So the set up below would now become a potential WW? If so, my vote would be "nay"

Hi Expo :  
1) Find this part of the code near the end of program: else LabelPos = Low[ib]; , it has been repeated two times.  
2) change both of them with this code : else LabelPos = NormalizeDouble(Low[ib]-0.5*iATR(NULL,0,10,ib),Digits);  
3)Now compile it and use, problem solved.  
4) you can change the position vertically, by modifying the 0.5 coefficient to other numbers, there are four of them 2 for High's and 2 for Low's.

Hi :  
Just i want to mention few thing about the charts that you are sharing.  
1) I believe the way you count the waves is a problem, you mixes waves of different fractal levels in counting.  
2) The HEW as far as i Know, usually moves in a channel, the first wave 1 , comes from a point outside the channel (point X) to form the first impulse wave #1 , then it retrace forms #2, after that another usually the largest wave #3 and so on to the fifth wave, the fifth wave, in 50% of the HEW, may not rich the upper channel line, and is referred to as The aborted fifth wave. reteracement of this wave is the beginning of corrective waves abc and/or even abcde. This is the wave which makes the third touch of price with trend line and will eventually break it.  
3)some of the waves that you are counting are not as large as it should be, they are smaller waves of a lower fractals(Noises)  
4) The best location to trade is at the beginning of #3 wave in HEW, which is a big challenge to locate so early in it formation, and resulted in most of my failures...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f622.png?v=15.1), in contrast CWW best trade location is at the beginning of the corrective wave abc, after formation of D(5) point, which locating this one too, plays with your soul and money....![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f634.png?v=15.1)  
5) HEW suggest trading with the trend buy, in upward moving channel, while an up going CWW is called a SELL CWW wave and suggest to take a sell trade, after D(5) completion.  
  
These are just my idea, no offense.

Hi Parvis,  
The Elliott Wave I follow is called Harmonic Elliott Wave.  
It differs from Traditional Elliott Wave.  
It simplifies the wave count, and clears up some of the ambiguities of Elliott Wave.   
There are no failed fifth waves in HEW, or channel constraints.   
Easiest way to understand it would be to watch the introduction video.

Just to clarify my point more, this is your pair, unfortunately i don't have 12H TF, so i am drawing it on the 1 day chart.

This is a bearish HEW, and these are the waves of the same degree of fractals, now has just finished its 3rd wave is going up to form the 4th one .  
An interesting thing about 3rd wave is that since it is the longest and the largest one, in many occasion you can see formation of a what is called zigzag wave (or ABC pattern), during formation of its leg

OH , no this is the code of your zigzag indicator, not mine.  
i have changed it and it takes only less than 5 minute and it will work like a charm.  
Here it is, i have changed it already, just compile and run.

Hi:  
I believe the bullish ride of GBPJPY has came to its end, the reasons:  
1)It has already reached the Target Line and had some reversal.(look at the picture in post #824)  
2) In tis picture I tried to combine Both potential CWW and HEW as i learned recently, as you see it completed the 4th wave already.  
3)I hope that somebody correct me if i am wrong, especially i ask for any idea or help from UTurn2.

Hi everybody:

I follow what your saying... but such a bullish move is more likely to carry on with its current momentum , for me as long as we stay above 138.40/70 zones im happy to carry on trailing this move up.... i can potentially see this reaching 142+ within this week... Daily TF is showing a target towards this level also.   
  
  
Until we make a LH and a LL i remain quite bullish this pair! 

Cheers!!PM23

Hi Chienung, thanks for posting. A very good question.  
  
Im sure opinions will vary but for me any minor high or minor low will work. Swing highs or lows would be ideal but in my opinion not always necessary. Personally I like starting points to be at least somewhat distinct from the general price action.  
  
Maybe some other posters will add their insight as well

You are very modest and you're work here is very generous. Although trading is an individual endeavor, it also has some team play as well. This thread is exactly what I was hoping for. Traders sharing their knowledge and special abilities all in the hopes that more people can attain their personal goals. iron sharpening iron.  
  
i know you said that you are retired and this is a hobby, I just hope members aren't unfairly taking advantage of your time

GBPJPY MLY Chart:  
Hi Parviz,  
just read your post.  
Not one that I trade, however, the MLY may be the key.  
Looks like an Uptrend began in 2011,  
with a correction ending in 2016.  
Wave ii White may be in place with a 50% retrace of Wave i White.  
So far, it's presenting a pin bar [Doji].  
The Wave iii White minimum target would be 181.225.   
I'll take a look on lower time frames and post again.  
Cheers, U2

Smaller positions with generous SL gives this set up a nice potential RR. Looking at the weekly, there should be a considerable battle at this level

Thanks a lot but:  
1) I wanted you to give me your idea about my HEW wave counting on the picture.(it is daily GBPJPY)  
2) When we don't know what is going to happen in this crazy world and its politicians tomorrow ,who knows where we will be, in years ahead, so i am interested only in daily and weekly charts changes at most .  
3)English is my 2nd language, and i am not good at it at all, so would you please, use simpler more understandable grammer ? and explain more, i am a novice as i said in forex trading.

Hi Parviz,  
GBPJPY DLY Chart:  
The MLY chart was just to establish the Bullishness of the pair.  
I see the Bulls back in charge.  
It may be abc correction over.  
I agree it's due a correction [pull back],  
however, I can't see the WW5 developing.  
Your English is fine Parviz.  
Truly, no need to worry about it.  
Cheers, U2

Thank you Expo33..I really appreciated your early responds. According to what you mentioned (Im sure opinions will vary but for me any minor high or minor low will work. Swing highs or lows would be ideal but in my opinion not always necessary. Personally I like starting points to be at least somewhat distinct from the general price action.) Can you please explain more???!!! I just want to know how did you come up with that X Point at that particular Level??? Why not the previous higher Level???Please advise..Thank you.

Swing highs or lows would be ideal but in my opinion not always necessary. Personally I like starting points to be at least somewhat distinct from the general price action.) Can you please explain more???!!! I just want to know how did you come up with that X Point at that particular Level??? Why not the previous higher Level???Please advise..Thank you.

You're welcome. I'm assuming you mean the GBP/USD daily trade. I'm away from my computer at the moment and viewing this from my phone right now. The previous swing high you mentioned wouldn't give us a valid WW because point B wouldn't make a higher high. This is a good example of the subjectivity involved when trading WWs. In this particular example I felt that X was distinct enough to be a valid starting point. Also, after mapping out the wave and seeing such good confluence with the filters, I had to trade it. So far it's about +80 pips and all SLs have been moved to BE

Yes...Mr Expo33...You are such a gentleman... permit me to address you like this..  
I really want to learn your trading skill... so that one day in the future I can become successful like you.. I hope!!!???  
Now I can understand when B is higher than the X Point you wait for C Point to establish... When C point is also higher than A point then I can see the uptrend is confirmed...Correct me if I am wrong Mr Expo33...Thank you

Yes you have it correct. Once you train your mind to recognize the structure it will allow you to focus on whatever filters you use so you can take the highest probability trades. If you are unsure try using the WW indicator to find the waves for you, then take the indicator off the chart and look at the structure. The more chart time  
you put in the easier it becomes.

Hi Poruchik.  
  
Not technically a Wolfe wave as point **C** doesn't re-trace back below point **X**

Hi U2  
  
Hope it works out for you but technically doesn't fit the definition of a WW as point 3 needs to be a higher high form point 1.

I didn't take this trade but a beautiful example of perfect AB=CD symmetry. Just barely convergent, but a still a WW. A nice crisp TDI cross as well.

Nice one and a good example of the challenges involved in trading a steep WW with a large sweet zone. Something we discussed a few weeks ago, where to enter? AB=CD completion is way down at the 261FIB @ 106.76. But as we discussed, AB=CD isn't a requirement for entering a trade. Candle symmetry is nice, 11 candles for both AB and CD.   
  
I'm curious if you entered this trade and if so how you determined your entry point. TDI cross seems to be the only filter that may have helped on this one.  
  
Good luck, -Kurt

A good example of a valid WW with absolutely horrible symmetry. AB=CD is in no man's land, and we don't have any meaningful previous S/R in the near past.  
  
To trade or not to trade? We have a TDI cross and multiple rejections at the 261FIB. Other than that, we have a huge sweet zone and we are dealing with a volatile pair.  
  
Small position with large stop above 261FIB or pass on this trade? One of the reasons I like trading WWs is that there are many other opportunities developing 24/7 so we don't have to force trades.

> A good example of a valid WW with absolutely horrible symmetry. AB=CD is in no man's land, and we don't have any meaningful previous S/R in the near past. To trade or not to trade? We have a TDI cross and multiple rejections at the 261FIB. Other than that, we have a huge sweet zone and we are dealing with a volatile pair. Small position with large stop above 261FIB or pass on this trade? One of the reasons I like trading WWs is that there are many other opportunities developing 24/7 so we don't have to force trades.

I didn't take this trade, just wanted to show an example that emphasizes the need for patience. It still may end up a winner but there are plenty of other fishes in the sea.

Hi Poruchik.  
  
An "Anti Wolfe wave" has the same structure as the classic Wolfe wave except that it is divergent. For example, line XB and line AC are diverging instead of converging. It does NOT fit the definition of a classic Wolfe wave, hence the name "Anti" Wolfe wave.   
  
I am going to remove the Anti WW from the first post and the thread as it's basically causing confusion. I should have never added it in the first place. Better we all just focus on the one classic structure as defined by Mr. Wolfe himself.  
  
Hope that helps.  
  
Cheers, -Kurt

yes, you should never include that at the first page kurt. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) Got me confused for a while there. But it's all good.

Not sure if you have been keeping up to date on all of the new posts, but in case you haven't, "parviz1953" has blessed this thread with an amazing WW indicator. If you haven't tried the newest version, it's on post #1  
  
It allows you to scan thru all time frames. It has multiple zig zag settings, instant fibos for every leg, both sweet zones, inputs to change colors, and the ability to choose completed and/or potential waves. An awesome tool. Let the indicator find the waves then use your filtering system to sift thru and find the best possible set ups.  
  
Anyways, hope you stick a around. Have a great weekend

yea, i did download his indicator when he first posted it but didn't help me much. But now since you mentioned it, i redownload again and guess what, it has opened my eyes in a big way. I always believe that indicators will cloud my judgement but this one actually helps scan quickly for potential WW in a fast time. I actually needed it a lot because scanning all the pairs daily really put a strain on my eyes and body. Thanks for mentioning that and also thanks a lot for your hard work mr parviz.  
  
In fact, we have a potential ww forming here. It has actually formed for cad/jpy. What do you guys think? Too steep?  
  
See, i would never found this wolfe wave if i have never used the indicator because scanning all pairs on 15-H1 has already put a lot of stress on me. Now i can do until daily. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

I'm glad you tried the new super charged WW indicator version.  
  
I'm still holding long on CAD/JPY from a 4H CWW from last week. Geopolitical risk off took all Yen pairs down the previous week. This week all of those pairs recovered EXCEPT the CAD/JPY. Why?? Because oil prices got crushed. Adding insult to injury, the Canadian CPI inflation data on Friday missed expectations.  
  
My entry was at the green circle. 200FIB being tested a second time. Small position, big stop loss below the 200FIB.

Outside the scope of this thread, but looking at my own Gann fan analysis on the daily suggests we are at an energy point that should provide some resistance. Any recovery in oil prices should give CAD/JPY a nice boost. I would think 80 would be a tough nut to crack.

Hello Parviz,  
  
I have a question about the fibo AB. Shouldn't it be the other way around? It is drawing lines based on the opposite direction now. XA and BC are fine. I attached this usd/jpy chart for your reference. Just gotta flip the 100 and 0 fibo the other side.  
  
Can you fix it?  
  
Thanks!

Hi All,  
Getting up to speed with mt4 and Parviz's Indicator.  
[For now, I only have mt4 on a demo account,  
not my live account]  
USDJPY H4 may be shaping up as a CWW?  
Cheers, U2

HI Parviz,  
I thought I would compare [Kurt's] CWW with the Harmonic Elliott Impulse Wave.  
It looks like you've coded the HEW from Wave iii to Wave v.  
Also it defines the end of Wave ii via the zigzags.  
So that's 60% of the HEW coded.  
[reverse engineered.]  
From what I can see, a CWW is a picture perfect  
Wave iv and v of a HEW Impulse Wave.  
[HEW: the WW Wave b doesn't have to be lower than the WW Wave x]   
Cheers, U2

Hi:  
No sir it is correct, when you put a fibo on AB, what you want to measure is the reteracement of BC ,which in your picture it is, correctly shown to be 38.2% exactly.  
And all the fibos are the same ,100% line is on the first point and 0% line on the second, and other way around is not giving you what you want to measure.

There's more..........  
This pic. shows a CWW [stretched] which occurs  
from HEW Wave (i) to (iii).  
The HEW Wave (iii) is usually very long,  
so the CWW target would most probably be hit.  
So your indicator [Parviz] codes the HEW Impulse waves!  
**Amazing!**  
Cheers,  
U2

OK , very good , i am really impressed. I was trying to correlate CWW and HEW somehow together, but , bravo i think ,You nailed it.  
And your idea , proves what i was saying before, in CWW we are trading the corrections, (wave 4 and wave A, counter trend trades), in contrast to CEW, which we try to catch the trend and trade the impulse waves themselves(Wave 3 and 5).

Maybe I am not understanding what is being proposed here. The 12345 pattern in this diagram does not fit the definition of a Wolfe wave as point 4 needs to re trace back higher than point 1. Think we had this discussion earlier but maybe I am missing something? Could you please clarify?  
  
I apologize. I don't want to seem like I'm raining on anyone's parade. I think the discussion is very productive and has the possibility of brainstorming some great ideas, just trying to keep to the purity of the structure.

Hello Jonica and welcome to this thread and to forex factory.  
  
I think as you spend more time here at the forum site you will have a better understanding of how to post comments and chart pictures. You will get more familiar with how to navigate around the site. Ask any questions here, we are glad to help if we can.  
  
In the meantime, if Wolfe waves are something you would like to study, then start from post #1 and take your time.  
  
Cheers, -Kurt

Hi, Expo & Parviz:  
First up I want to thank you for the Wolfe Wave thread and this awesome indicator! You guys rock!  
After going through this thread I have a few questions that I hope you can somehow clarify:

  1. How am I supposed to use the WW indicator? What I’m still confused about is how you actually determine Point D (5)? Does the indicator actually give you D (5) when all conditions are met, or else? Do I miss anything?
  2. After you have determined D (5), am I right in saying that you just set your limit order there and wait for the market to take you in?
  3. When setting your limit order, how do you determine your initial stop-loss?

Would be great if you can clarify with some chart examples. Thank you for your time and help!  
  
Shuo

Hi Shuo and welcome to the thread.  
  
I'll try to answer your questions the best that I can.  
  
1) The indicator chooses potential/completed waves based on the zig zag "ext depth" setting. For instance, one setting might not show a valid wave while a different setting may show a valid wave. I suggest you put the indicator on a chart and change the "extdepth" to each different setting and see what happens. The indicator automatically chooses point D so that the length of segment AB = CD. This doesn't mean that the last leg (CD) will necessarily reach that point, it just shows you where the exact completion point would be if AB were to exactly equal CD. The indicator will give you point D as soon as the CD leg starts, in other words as soon as the zig zag determines point C.  
  
Here is an example where price reversed 61 pips before the D point. Note how the indicator shows where the AB=CD point is even though the price never actually made it down that far.  
  
**NZD/CAD DAILY CWW**

**  
  
2) Not necessarily. Where you set your order will depend on your personal filtering system. I like to scale in with multiple positions as prices moves into my sweet zone. This is where there is some subjectivity in how you enter. Many traders will wait for the price to reverse, maybe wait for the TDI to cross. I like to use the BC FIB extension, previous S/R, and Gann fans as my filters. I ook for a "zone" for entry not a static price.  
  
3) Again, stop loss will depend on your own personal risk profile. I tend to put my stops below the next FIB extension level. Each trade varies and my stop loss may be dependent on factors that are only particular to that trade.  
  
Hope this helps, any other questions I will try to answer as best I can.  
  
Thanks for posting and best trading to you.  
  
-Kurt  
  
PS. Hopefully Parviz will correct me if I'm wrong. I'm also still learning the finer points of this indicator.

@Parviz  
  
I have finally gotten some free time to really have a look at the indicator in action and have a couple of questions:  
  
1) I have never read anywhere or seen anyone use the 120 or 241 FIB. I'm just wondering where you got them from?  
  
2) In the chart below, why does the indicator still show a potential WW when it clearly has broken down and violated the parameters of a valid WW?  
  
Thanks mate

Hi :  
1) In harmonic pattern when C point retrace .382 then the BC projection can be between 241 to 261.8, i got this number from there, and 120 i believe from HEW ? but just i want to add all the possible fibos that anybody may need.  
2)when indicator find and draw a pattern , it will stay, unless another new pattern comes up. So as long as there is no new one the last found will remain.  
3)Unfortunately , i have lost nearly everything, when a virus has hit my mac computer, and still i was not able to recover them on mac , although i have backups from my source codes but, it was hard to run a window program on the mac to begin with, now during last several days i was trying to return it to its previous state and i failed. I believe i have to buy a new window running computer to be able to revive my codes.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f634.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f62c.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f621.png?v=15.1).  
4)For now, I can not think of any thing else, but may be we together can find a solution to change this algorithm later.  
Have a nice day  
PS : I have checked it again it is indeed 123.6 and will change it in next version.

Dear Expo :  
You are totally right , actually i believe that he was suggesting that if we remove this condition (X location between B and C) it also can give us other opportunity for trading based on the 3rd wave construction of HEW, and this was the reason he said

No special software, just the Meta4 platform.  
  
I use FxChoice for my demo (also have live acct with them) because you can have unlimited demo accounts for an unlimited time. Also, they use the New York candle close which I prefer.

Let me tell you an interesting point , get the reciprocal of any of the known fibonacci relations (.382,.5,.618,.707,.786,.886) and you get these secondary fibo relation numbers(2.618,2.0,1.618,1.41,1.27,1.13) and whenever you have point C retracement of the first set you expect to get to the amount of the 2nd set projection of Bc.......!!!  
In simple math, we can say : the amount of projection of BC has inverse relationship with amount of C retracement.  
  
And here I quote a part of a good book on harmonic trading by Scott M. Carney  
  
**Harmonic Trading Ratios**  
**Primary Ratios:**  
(Directly derived from the Fibonacci Number Sequence)   
0.618 = Primary Ratio  
1.618 = Primary Projection   
**Primary Derived Ratios:**

  1. 0.786 = Square root of the 0.618 ( )
  2. 0.886 = Fourth root of 0.618 or

Square root of the 0.786 ( 

  1. 1.13 = Fourth root of 1.618 or  
Square root of the 1.27 ( )
  2. 1.27 = Square root of the 1.618 (  
**Complementary Derived Ratios:**

  1. 0.382 = (1-0.618) or 0.6182
  2. 0.707 = Square root of 0.50 ( )
  3. 1.41=Squarerootof2.0( )
  4. 2.0 = (1+1)
  5. 2.24=Squarerootof5( )
  6. 2.618 = 1.6182

  1. 3.14 = Pi (See later section The Importance of Pi (3.14) in Harmonic Trading)
  2. 3.618 = (1+2.618)

Hi parviz,  
  
My MEDIUM term view is that October 2016 was a turning point low...122 towards 148 i believe that move to be the accumulation phase of a primary trend, we have had our correction back to 135 (50% ) and now i think we enter the participation phase with 148 target possible by June 15th. Then things could get messy, we may even see the excess move to 155 maybe.... we would need to see LH and LL to start negating a more bullish outcome if reach 148. DOW Theory is what its based on   
my levels are based on standard psychological but also technical S+R (support & resistance)... 138.40 zone simply due to being a yearly low even though broken when we reached 135 new year low, as this level SHOULD come as support the WW gave me that confirmation i wanted to strengthen my case for myself on the DAILY TF, so this brought about further conviction that im in the right move.... 142 was a WW target i had on the daily but i also had such a target as a zone are as we can see it on the DAily TF how many times price reacts to this zone area.  
  
The GAP now does confuse a few things, i dont like GAPS for obvious reasons, but i think with the volatility we will have in this pair and based on the move and cycle i believe we are in i would continue to be bullish (with the price targets i mentioned) till we see either LH - failure swing and negate the bullish outlook, even though fundamentally it should all be against GBPJPY bullish outlook (BREXIT and WARS .... SELL the RUMOR BUY the FACT ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) )  
  
My Long term view is that we see uncharted territory just not yet, i hope 

Cheers!!PM23

Agree, I've seen this before. Of course .5, .707, and .886 aren't technically derived from the sequence in the way the standard fib levels are derived. Still not seeing where the 120 and 241 come from. Not really a big deal anyways, was just curious.

This is another pragraph from the same book:  
[  
**AB=CD Reciprocal Ratios**  
In the AB=CD pattern, the alignment of Fibonacci ratios within the structure usually manifests specific reciprocal relationships. The reciprocal ratio of the C point retracement of the AB leg usually indicates which BC projection is utilized to define the Potential Reversal Zone (PRZ). For instance, a 0.618 retracement at the C point typically will possess a 1.618 BC projection that converges closest with the completion of the AB=CD. This reciprocal relationship within the equivalent AB=CD pattern defines the best PRZ for this structure. The reciprocal ratios that complement the AB=CD structure are as follows:   
**C Point Retracement 0.382**  
**0.50 0.618 0.707 0.786 0.886**  
**BC Projection .24 or 2.618**  
**2.0 1.618 1.41 1.27 1.13**  
The reciprocal ratios help define the completion of the pattern. However, the most important consideration to remember is that the BC projection should converge closely with the completion of the AB=CD.   
  
when c retracement is .382 then projection is either 2.41 or 2.618(this is exactly copied from the book and there is, interestingly a printing error of .24 ,instead of 2.41)  
  
  
EDITTED : OH sorry you are right my mistake it was indeed 2.24 and the first number was missed in printing the table.but here i found another source .

I understand the theory and have seen dozens and dozens of harmonic charts from bats to sharks to gartleys to chipmunks (actually no chipmunks), but I have never seen the 120 appear anywhere. It doesn't appear in either of your posts either. I know, I'm acting like a lawyer prosecuting the poor 120 FIB. "On the night in question, did you or did you not.............."![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60e.png?v=15.1)  
  
Anyways, back to Wolfe waves. The French election has kind of thrown many pairs out of their natural harmonic rhythm, which is quite normal for exceptional news events. Once the market settles back into its normal flow, we should see some good opportunities.  
  
Cheers  
  
Note: Maybe the printing error was supposed to be 2.24 because that's the FIB that's shown on Scott's site as well as many others for the BAT pattern. See here: <http://harmonictrader.com/blog/2013/08/03/crab/>

**EDIT: Before this trade triggered, I realized the stop loss wasn't far enough down. If you look at the fib extensions, the SL should be below the 200. Why? Well, theoretically if price breaks the 161 level then it's likely going to continue to the 200 so it makes sense to put the SL below the 200**

This happened to work out well, not all trades do, but this is a text book example. Last position just about hit, will close manually at this point. Putting the stop loss below the next fib level gave this trade just enough room to breathe. Nothing worse than being right only to lose because the stop loss wasn't placed correctly.  
  
Not trying to toot my own horn, just walking all the way through this trade

Excellent.   
  
Thank you Poruchik. I have casually glanced at the golden ratio theory before but this makes it very clear

The bigger wave always takes precedence over the smaller wave when taking a trade. If you look at post #915 you can see the stop loss for the bigger wave allows the trade to breath properly.  
  
Smaller waves that develop inside bigger waves are used more for exit. For example, you trade a 4H bullish WW and half way to your target price a bearish WW develops on the hourly, maybe time to exit early.

Have you noticed why parvizz's indicator didn't draw this setup? I think it's because of the XA section. It's not clear there with the high low while it's very clear if you look with human eyes. There was a double bottom there and indicator ignored this signal.

I'm assuming you are taking about the AUD/CAD set up? I can't remember if I found it manually or with the indicator. Do you have the zig zag set right? Time frame?  
  
I'll check when I get home later.

yes, the aud/cad setup. i have tried with all different settings but it did not show up. I think you found that setup manually. I think i'll go indicator free for a while first and see how it goes.  
  
Edited: My bad, it did show up when i changed to depth 20. I always use 6 and 12 and rarely go to 20. Do you guys change the depth everytime for every pair?

Ah, 20 rings a bell.   
  
I usually can see the waves beforehand, especially if they are pretty well formed. I change the depth to fit a wave that I know is there then I match it to my personal zig zag that shows the pips and candles. Then I'll take the indicator off so I can see the price action a little better. Especially if im using other filters. Don't want the screen to be too crowded. When I post I like to take everything off the chart except the manual drawing to make it clear for traders to see, especially for traders that may be new to WWs.

Booked 35 pips on one position and was stopped out at BE on the other two. So, trade is over now. Original TPs are on post #919

Took this failed nzd/cad setup earlier. Symmetry was not nice. Need to be extra picky next time when choosing wolfe waves.

Have to trust the set up and be patient.  
  
Took this trade yesterday but took 1/3 of my position off the table and booked the profit of 35 pips. Then set the other 2/3of my position to BE. Ultimately the other 2/3 of the position got stopped out on a retest. A winning trade, BUT it would have been a home run if I had left the original 30 pip stop loss in place and let the set up play out.  
  
I have to work on my patience.

I was also tracking this but never entered. Similar set up on EUR/CAD DAILY. That's the one I took.

I'm not sure what you mean "failed".  
  
Depends on your entry and your risk/reward profile.  
  
AB=CD completion level is at 1.3602 and price only went as high as 1.3625. Target line is conservatively at least 100 pips so a 30 pip stop loss from AB=CD keeps this trade alive with a RR a bit more than 3:1

Sometimes no matter what we do, the trade fails and we just have to accept it and look for the next opportunity. Imo, the symmetry for the ABCD wasn't too bad. It's all about the filters.  
  
I put a Gann fan on the hourly chart (there was a bigger wave in play here, same AB=CD level as the 30 minute though). It shows the completion level being in no mans land. Once a Gann line is broken, there seems to be a good chance it will make it to the next line, which in this case, it did.

sometimes WW will fail you at first lvl, but you have to try again on next lvl to recover your loss.  
  
NZD/CAD  
  
You see WS and 261.8? that's the second entry. or you may just skip this trade cause it's not near SR lvl.

I am watching this also. But my areas of interest is .7390 to long. Then maybe .7340 for stoploss. What is your stoploss?

Hmm, i consider it a failed one if it breaks through 2.0. Reentering at 261.8 is well, just another new trade and don't constitute to wolfe waves anymore. You can call that a fibo entry but definitely not a wolfe wave reentry.  
  
Just my 2 cents.

The stop loss is on my chart at .7370 however I only got 2 small positions filled and have moved both SLs to BE. If I get stopped out I will reload if price moves back towards 74. For now, just free rolling.  
  
My gut feeling was that price wasn't going to make it to the AB=CD completion level at 7383 so I scaled in earlier than usual.

yes you are right~ 2nd entry is not a WW on NZD/CAD, but it is a WW on EUR/USD.  
  
Maybe we can trade with this formula...  
  
1 2nd entry in and turns out a new WW, we trade it as normal. (EU for ex.)  
  
2 2nd entry in and turns out nothing, exit earlier. (N/C for ex.)

AS you wished, now you may have the zigzag values on the same indicator, just a few point to mention:  
1) The color of zigzag values are the same as fibos, you may select that.  
2) There is a factor in input that you may select relative position for values, i have preset it to 10 , you may change it till it fits your taste.  
3) You may select to show zigzag line and the values in input, if set to false it does not show either .

PS:By the way i am working on a new version which is going to automate every thing :  
1) It look for all 6 Extdepth that you set in the input and draw every thing that can be find and draw them all.  
2) for every depth it first look for possible Completed CWW, if can not find any, then it will look for the Potential ones.  
3)After it has done that, then you may select which one of the patterns you like to keep and erase the others.  
Indeed 70% of the program has been coded already, the reason that i am talking about it now is that, the code is ever growing bigger and bigger and when it is finished it would be really hard to change any part of it. So please everybody interested help me to improve it, with your ideas and suggestions, what may go wrong by doing that, i mean logically or algorithmic wise , and if it would be worth-ed at all

That's really fantastic mate.  
  
I will be away from my computer until tomorrow but I just had a moment to put the new indicator on a chart. Really super job!  
  
Only suggestion I have at the moment is getting rid of the decimal place for the pips as it would make it neater and save some space. For example instead of 64.4(8) just 64(8).  
  
Sorry I'm such a color fanatic. Is there any way to allow for changing the color of the zig zag pips/candles without having to make them an input option. I'm assuming its coded to be the same as the fibo input option. If not, no problem. I don't want to add extra work for something so trivial.  
  
I am excited to check out how the extdepth function works but won't have anytime until tomorrow in the morning. I'm hosting a toddler sleepover at my house. Seven kids between 5 and 6 years old!! Then off to a school field trip with them at 9am. Maybe I can sneak a peek at some charts before they wake up. If I don't start making grilled cheese sandwiches right now I am going to have an angry mob of kindergarten kids!  
  
Cheers!

Hello my friend,  
  
I thinks there is only one thing need to be changed...  
  
X must touch C, dont u think this rule is too strict?  
  
Sometimes X just a few pips away from C, and that makes the signal invalid...  
  
could u pls. add a range function for X and C based on ADR distance and TF.  
  
EX.   
  
mathabs(X-C)<35% ADR XC touched = true; (for Period()=D1) if ADR is 100pips, X-C<35pips = singal valid  
  
mathabs(X-C)<20% ADR XC touched = true; (for Period()=H4)   
  
mathabs(X-C)<10% ADR XC touched = true; (for Period()=H1)   
  
mathabs(X-C)<5% ADR XC touched = true; (for Period()=M15)

Here, code for ADR...  
  
point=Point;   
if( Digits==3 || Digits==5 ) point=point*10;  
  
int n=1;  
static int adr1,adr5,adr10,adr;  
double s=0.0;  
for(int i=1;i<=20;i++)  
{  
while(TimeDayOfWeek(iTime(NULL,PERIOD_D1,n))==0) n++;  
s=s + ( iHigh(NULL,PERIOD_D1,n) - iLow(NULL,PERIOD_D1,n) )/point;  
if(i==1) adr1=MathRound(s);  
if(i==5) adr5=MathRound(s/5);  
if(i==10) adr10=MathRound(s/10);  
n++;  
}  
adr = MathRound((adr1+adr5+adr10)/3.0);  
  
  
pls. also add a function to turn on/off for stuffs in yellow box...thanks!

That is a perfect idea. What i am doing now is scanning the pairs manually by changing depth manually which costs a lot of time and work. And sometimes the formation don't show until i click on refresh which is frustrating. It would be great if it can automatically scan all pairs and all depths and list out all the possible formations.  
  
It would be a good idea if it can scan through multiple timeframes also. For example, if i attach the indicator on a 15min chart, it will show possible formations on H1 or H4 even on daily? Would it be possible? If not, then scanning with all depths first is a start.

I didn't take this as I haven't had much screen time this week.  
  
Well done Croc. Glad you got back in the winner's circle. Hopefully you can build on that and create some positive trading momentum.

Thank you for considering my opinion.  
  
This was suggested once before. I still think it best to stick to the purity of the original teaching by Mr. Wolfe. As we discussed before, there are many new traders on this forum and I wouldn't want to confuse them by bending the rules. If experienced traders want to stretch the parameters a little bit, then by all means do so, but maybe they can find those waves manually instead of using the indicator for that.

> {quote} That's really fantastic mate. I will be away from my computer until tomorrow but I just had a moment to put the new indicator on a chart. Really super job! Only suggestion I have at the moment is getting rid of the decimal place for the pips as it would make it neater and save some space. For example instead of 64.4(8) just 64(8). Sorry I'm such a color fanatic. Is there any way to allow for changing the color of the zig zag pips/candles without having to make them an input option. I'm assuming its coded to be the same as the fibo input...

Actually, forget what I said about the colors. I think it's fine the way it is. But getting rid of the decimal point on the pips  
would be nice.

EURJPY Long trade, the timeframe is very small, not very big position on this one!  
  
Edit: Target hit. Risked 9 pips and gained 17.  
  
Nice structural support and 38.2% fib, not a big target as the high of the move is a very strong resistance zone.

Your wolfe waves are very unclear. It might not be wolfe waves at all. Always look for the ones that are screaming at you.  
  
Word of advice. I see that you are doing it on a smaller timeframe which is what i did when i just started. I think it's totally noise on 15min and lower. Try 30 min and above and you can see clearly the waves forming. Yes there will be less signals. I think there might be only 1 signal per day but the accuracy is much higher.  
  
here's one i did earlier on the 30 min. Hope it helps.

Sorry if that's the case. Is the one attached to this post better? I wanted to show the additional confluence that was present as I find that only the Wolfe Wave isn't enough, confluence is needed.  
  
In regards to the low-timeframe tip. I have been researching these since the start of this thread and I have found that the lower timeframes work (almost) as good as the big ones, if strong confluence is present. Today I've had 4 out of 5 winners, where 4 of my trades were on the 5-15 min timeframe.  
  
Sure, the small timeframe ones are not as accurate, but winrate is not everything when trading. I would much rather take 100trades in a month with only 73% winrate, rather than only 20 with 80% winrate.  
  
Please tell me if the setups are still unclear.

ok now that you draw it like this, i can totally see the waves. Here i try to replicate your chart. I don't understand your trendline because it doesn't seem like a normal drawing but hey, if it works for you, why not.  
  
I would like to know where is your stoploss and takeprofit initially. How did you enter the trade? Was it based on fib? Candlestick pattern? Would like to learn how you manage to trade that. I am getting boring at higher timeframes as well but i couldnt seem to find peace in smaller timeframes.  
  
Also, can you post your charts as of today? Would like to learn from your winning trades.

Terrific mate, yes just like your chart. The trendline is not very good at all, the confluence which made me really enter the trade was the 38.2% fib and the strong structural support which you can find further to the left.  
  
My stoploss and profit target are shown on the picture below. I put the stop a good amount below the entry (no real rule, I just thought it looked good. If price moves below that level, it isn't a completed wolfe wave, it will just be praying that price will turn=I'm out). Target is below the small resistance area marked in red.  
  
I usually enter on a limit order where the AB=CD completes if I think there is enough confluence in that area. On this trade there was: Strong structural support, 38.2% fib, very mediocre trendline, 200% fib inversion, wolfe wave and AB=CD pattern. That's enough for me to enter on limit as soon as price reaches the price. This makes it possible for me to get a 1:2 RR with only small movements. Check the chart below. I got a 1:2 RR even though price moved a very limited amount to the upside.  
  
Will post it in my next post, hold on!

i actually cannot see your initial entry and stoploss/take profit order. Can you specify which point exactly? Or better yet, the number itself?  
  
if you entered at 2, what is your exact number?

Oh sorry, you wanted the exact number. Exact numbers: Entry: 121.470, Stop: 121.379 Profit: 121.639  
  
Here are the trades I took today. Most of them you can scroll down to see the higher-TF confluence.  
1: CADCHF: [https://www.tradingview.com/chart/CA...th-confluence/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/CADCHF/rtGCgJNu-CADCHF-wolfe-wave-with-confluence/)  
2: AUDCHF (closed before the weekend for a 1:2 RR): [https://www.tradingview.com/chart/AU...th-confluence/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/AUDCHF/lkL1ELk1-AUDCHF-LONG-Wolfe-wave-with-confluence/)  
3: AUDUSD (moved to half of my target then hit SL): [https://www.tradingview.com/chart/AU...th-confluence/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/AUDUSD/KMusscHF-AUDUSD-Wolfe-with-confluence/)  
4: EURCAD (Entered right on the AB=CD tip, but didn't have time to upload until it had already moved a bit. 1:2 profit target, stop a bit under the AB=CD tip):[https://www.tradingview.com/chart/EU...JyiJCB-EURCAD/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/EURCAD/XgJyiJCB-EURCAD/)  
5: EURJPY (1:2 profit target, stop a bit under the AB=CD tip): [https://www.tradingview.com/chart/EU...lfe-Wave-Long/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/EURJPY/dNRdCCbk-EURJPY-Wolfe-Wave-Long/)  
  
Sorry about some of them not having the exact entry/stop/tp indicated, I can send it if you really want to lol.

ok, may i know why you pick that number? Was it random or it is fixed? Can you replicate it next time you see similar setups or it's just based on your gut feeling? I want to pick your brains as to how you pick your entry and stoploss. I don't see the reason you pick that reason because AB=CD ended at 121.50. Why it is 121.47 and not 121.42?  
  
And where is that 200 fib confluence you mentioned? I couldnt find it.

Haha no problem. Yes the AB=CD didn't exit exactly on 121.47. The reason for the entry being there is that I use the cTrader platform where I just drag-and-drop the orders, I do not type the price in manually. I would place it in approximately the same place, maybe +-1 pip.  
  
The 200% fib is in the pictures. On the attached photo it's at the red arrow, although it is only shown with a "2".  
  
No problem at all buddy, It's friday night and I have nothing better to do ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1) Did you take any nice trades today/during the week?

Just noticed that I drew that AB=CD a bit wrong. If you look at this picture instead (the red lines) the entry would actually have been at an even better price (about 121.449). Sorry if this caused confusion.

Is there any reason why you don't download a meta4 demo platform? That way you can use the amazing indicator that Parviz has worked so hard on. Also, it would make the set ups so much clearer for everyone to see and would encourage a healthy debate on each set up. Everyone would benefit.  
  
For example, on the AUD/CHF trade we discussed, look how clear it is. The indicator even maps out a secondary sweet zone. I think it's a work of art!

Well primarily it is for three reasons. 1: I would much rather be able to find them without the indicator, I am not a very big fan of indicators anymore haha. 2: I have read that the indicator needs a change of settings to find small as well as big patterns, seems easier to do it by hand? 3: I do not like metatrader 4 at all. There are much better charting solutions out there (when trading "naked").  
  
I also tried out one of the first versions but always found it better to find the waves by hand. Of course I want to make it easier for all of you so I just downloaded the latest version (v8.5) but I can't get it to work. Put it into the experts folder but nothing happens when I drag it to the chart. Am I doing something wrong?  
  
Yeah it was a very nice one, I took profit before the markets closed today, 1:2 RR, nice!

Ignored, what a surprise. Come on guys, ask yourself one simple question - are you making consistent money from this baloney? If not, it's time to find something based more on market facts and less on voodoo waves. To the reply below, it's no skin off my nose buddy. Yes I go around to different threads. Why? Because I want people to stop letting others think for them. Critical thinking and looking at the raw price data is what works. Obfuscating data with waves, averages, or oscillators just puts you behind the game. Your loss, literally.

Sir please put it in the indicator folder, it is not an expert adviser ..., you know it is like doing calculation on large data by hand,when you have computer at your disposal..!!, just it is faster.

yes sir , in the beginning it was just the completed CWW, but if you follow the posts and the path of progression of it then, you will see why and how it traveled the path to this stage of completion , it is version 8.5 now, and hopefully soon fully automated version 9 will be ready.

I've noticed you basically add nothing productive to anyone's thread. Just trolling around trying to discourage traders from reaching their full potential. As such, you have been preemptively banned form posting here. If you think this or any other system is foolish hogwash, that is your right. Just move on and don't waste server space on this thread.  
  
I've been studying "price action" for 10 years as have many traders here and on other threads, but to suggest that harmonic structures, candle patterns, etc etc don't work at all is close minded. There are many ways to skin a cat

As I stated in the first post in discussing this indicator, of course it's important to be able to spot WWs with the naked eye. But using the indicator saves time and allows you to track many more waves. Then that extra time can be used in trying to filter out the bad waves and focus on the best waves with the best structure and confluence.  
  
The reason I suggested meta4 is because that's the platform that the indicator is made for. Otherwise my head may explode if I have to try and decipher whats going on here:![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60e.png?v=15.1)

Another advantage of using this indicator is that, when people talk about CWW , it seems all are using the same standard language to describe it and surely it will help to communicate better.

Zig zag couldn't be set to detect this one but I drew it manually and will be watching it next week. I have been using the Gann fan a lot lately to see how productive it is as a filter. This one shows nice confluence with AB=CD, 161FIB, and the 8x1 Gann fan line.  
  
Sorry, chart is a little "busy" with the Gann fan on there:

Hi Friend,  
  
I think you drew the line wrong for the cad/chf trade. Don't think it is a wolfe wave. Even if it is, i think it's a weak one. I will attach more examples next post.

Here i attached two examples of my trades that worked and failed. I think the importance is the sweet zone area. It has to look good or in symmetry. Some of the wolfe waves are valid but the sweet zones look way off. You guys get what i mean?  
  
BTW, good ban expos. No need to waste time debating if this works or not. Keep the positive flowing.

Here's another failed one with bad symmetry. I think this really needs to based on your experience to see the AB=CD formation. The more you look at it, at the angles, the symmetry, the more it will come out to you.  
  
Edit: another example.

A good example of using confluence for entry. Here we have price reversing before the AB=CD which is perfectly normal. In addition, the symmetry isn't very good.  
  
**The question is:** How do we know when to enter or to start scaling in? Well, that's a question that each trader has to answer for himself. It's our responsibility to find a filtering system that gives us the best odds off success. For me it's still a personal journey. The possibilities are only limited by our imagination (and by our willingness to learn and work at it)  
  
For me, I love my fibos and I'm beginning to love the Gann fan. In this example, 3 layers of confluence trumps the fact that we have poor symmetry and the fact that price hasn't reached he AB=CD completion level. Neither are a requirement for an entry.

Now, strip away everything from the chart and have a look at the fibo/Gann fan confluence, nearly to the pip. We have the BC extension 141fibo exactly at the larger move 78.6fibo exactly at the bottom range of the Gann fan. Coincidence? Maybe, maybe not. For me, just the sort of confluence that would give me the confidence to pull the trigger early instead of waiting for the AB=CD or waiting for a reversal and TDI cross. The TDI cross is 30 pips above the reversal point. In my opinion, you'd gain nothing by waiting except a higher risk entry with less potential. It's also important to note that you would already know where that green circle is going to be before price reaches that point. So if your mapping and tracking the trade with your filters already in place, you won't have to second guess yourself when the time comes for action. The last thing we want to do is fire from the hip like a wild west gunslinger. We want calculated, predetermined zones of entry.

**NOTE:** The WW hasn't reached the target line by any means, and may never reach the target line but the reversal so far is a nice 40 pips giving us the opportunity to bank some pips and let the rest of the positions free roll. I know it's human nature to want the "home run" but 40 pips a day would make your life pretty comfortable over time

Hi guys,  
  
Kanzler sure is an agressive troll and has only a demo trend explorer of one trade old..., but this post sounds wise to me.  
  
With all due respect to Expo33 and I am sorry to say, but Expo33 has deleted his failing trade explorer that had an enormous drawdown, so Kanzler is actually right.  
  
Criticisms are not pleasant but should be welcomed, for obvious reasons.

I deleted my TE because it was an experiment that involved trades that involved strategies other than Wolfe waves. That's what demo accounts are for, testing out new strategies. Once a strategy proves to be unfruitful, then we try to make adjustments or put the strategy to rest for good. I thought it may be a discouragement to traders trying to learn the WW strategy. In hindsight, I should only have a TE that reflects solely the WW strategy.  
  
Kanzler doesn't criticize, he just takes pleasure in demeaning people. That type of behavior isn't tolerated here. I didn't actually see any criticism, just an immature man laughing at WW strategy.  
  
If you have something productive to add to our discussion, please do. We've already wasted to much energy on a troll.  
  
Cheers, -Kurt

Your trend explorer name was Wolf wave and linked to this thread and was demo, sad you do not take responsibility for it by deleting it..., oh yes of course, how stupid was I to think it was about WW and your trading skill ?  
It was maybe just a keypad mistouch or something ? Why would anyone want to share a trading activity on a given thread about a given strategy ? Obviously for the same reason that you deleted it.  
  
I was expecting wiser words from you, I am very disappointed.

Exactly, I name it Wolfe wave and then traded with strategies other than Wolfe wave. So it really didn't make sense to keep a TE that didn't reflect the WW strategy.  
  
If I remember correctly, when I was on vacation you were constantly arguing with another poster. I can see that you're not here to add anything of value to our discussion. As such, it's time for you to be put in your playpen with Kanzler.

I have a feeling that one should try to identify WW setups at a higher tf (say daily), and then its smaller "fractal" duplicate at the lower tf (say hourly) for entry in the sweet zone. (There was a guy on the forum called skunny with similar setups.) This would allow for a massive RR.

Hello,  
  
I follow this thread, and it has already brought me some good trades.  
  
I use the wolf wave waves more on the Daily time frame.  
  
Would it be worth a thought to check if a currency pair in the daily a wave with short announces this possible announcement to the other couples also check.  
  
For example :  
  
GBP-YEN  
  
D Point --- Announcement Short  
  
Check whether similar waves are in the pair GBP-USD, GBP-AUD, GBP-CAD or GBP-NZD, so that GBP is the main currency  
  
Or  
  
The driving currency is YEN (USD-YEN, AUD-YEN, GBP-YEN), so there would be a possibility if a trend break could take place.  
  
Greetings Steffen  
  
PS. Sorry for my bad english I am trying to translate with google translate.

Less talk, more charts. Just ban anyone that is not contributing anything useful, including me or parviz. Always remember, don't feed the trolls. They will pull you down to their levels.  
  
As the thread starter, it is your responsibility to maintain the quality of the thread and don't let it succumb to trolls and haters. No need to waste time with them. They don't like your thread, ban them and move on. Of course, if you can talk some sense into them, it would be great. E.G, private messages.  
  
here, i attach one failed WW because there is no confluence at all. I simply enter because it's a WW and symmetry looks very nice. Note to all, need to find at least another confluence before entering a WW. Be it a round number, fibo, gann, pivot, s/r, MAs, all other shits you could find.

Hey krossaren,  
  
I was looking at all your previous trades, some look nice, some i just don't get it if they are WW. Doesn't matter though. As long as you make money.  
  
I wanted to know how you manage your positions? Do you have a fixed tp/sl per pair? How much risk you putting on each trade? E.g, 5% for 10 pips stoploss or you just enter based on price action?  
  
For expo, i think he's managing based on multiple positions. He entered one early, then scale in second position at worse price to average in. Then maybe third position at worser price to average in. If price took off with his all three positions and went to tp, he will hit a big home run. The problem with this is it's very complicated to me, I don't know how he calculate the risk percentage each trade and you might miss the big move if the price only took your first position and went to your take profit area. For me, i mostly enter based on risk percentage, for example, if i calculate the eurusd pair might be 12 pips sl, i divide by 5% for 12 pips. I mostly aim for 1 to 1 risk ratio only.  
  
Comment on guys.

I am sorry if some seem unclear. As you can see they are marked as "private" charts which mean they can only be seen if I give the link (which I have here). As they were originally intended for my eyes only I haven't made them extremely clear, jusrt quickly drawn them so I can understand them when looking back on them later. Is there any specific one you want me to clarify?  
  
I have read that Expo scales in/out of his positions and honestly I think that it is up to everyone to decide what they feel is best. Personally I never do. I put a limit order at the end of the AB=CD, put the stop a couple of pips below/above (depending on timeframe) and set my target at about 1-2.5RR (depending on S/R zones coming up). I don't go for more as I rather take many small wins than occasionally big ones. This limits the drawdown.  
  
I do just like you do with the percentage of risk. I never risk more than 2-2.5% and divide that with the amount of pips to get the position size.  
  
I hope this helped you, and nice setups you sent. I have found that past horizontal support/resistance zones at the sweet zone works like a charm when trading these patterns. A nice fibonacci retracement (38.2, 50 or 61.8%) as well and it's a solid trade.  
  
Take care!

Another tip: on the chart you linked here I would need **_very_** strong structural resistance in order to short at the sweet zone due to the very strong bullish trend.

Hi Ritter and thanks for posting.  
  
If I understand you correctly, maybe you are talking about correlation. If I'm trading GBP/JPY then I would certainly check the GBP/USD and USD/JPY pairs to see if there were any developing waves as well.

Yes, I mean, if there are also waves in the other couples, which confirm the movement of the couple to act, one could be quite sure that there will be a sure wave.  
  
  
If the pair GBP-YEN is taken and a wave is suggested,  
  
There must be similar waves in almost all couples who are dealing with GBP or all couples have to do with the YEN depending on which currency is the driving force.

Seems like you are onto something here. I just discovered that myself also this week.  
  
Will see how next week goes! After all, the cycle of a trader is:-  
  
1) discover hope  
2) testing the possible outcome  
3) failed  
4) repeat

Hi U2, I agree with your assessment, 130.50 seems to be an important area.  
  
I have been watching this wave for a week on the daily and believe there is a huge downside potential. Question is, when?  
  
I took the WW indicator off the chart and had a look at some Gann fans and fibos. Pretty simplistic but seems like there should be major resistance heading into 130 if price even makes it that far. Here's what I'm looking at:  
  
GBP/USD WEEKLY - price reaching the 8x1 Gann line on last impulse move, with FIB confluence

Speaking of 130 I didn't even notice this little WW on the 30MIN. Potential completion right at 130.

GBPUSD 2H Chart:  
Hi Kurt,  
I can count 5 waves up in Wave a v Green.  
Wave b v Green difficult to define.   
**Wave c v Green has definite targets**  
**between 1.30265 and 1.30691.**  
If the count is correct,   
the Wave c v Green should rally in 5 waves impulsive.  
[I would like to see 1.30902 to 1.31691 = 61.8% and 76.4% projections]  
Monday a holiday.   
Cheers, U2

Thanks for posting U2.  
  
Honestly, I have very little understanding of EWs but will keep these levels in mind. I know I will only be short GU if the opportunity arises.  
  
Off for the first hike of the year, then check out some charts tonight  
  
Cheers all. Great week of trading ahead!

Placed a small Sell Limit Order at 1.3165 with a 30 pip SL.  
[4 pips below and SL 26 pips above the 76.4% projection at 1.3169]  
Will monitor the progress and adjust to suit if required.  
Edit:  
Note: It could fizzle out at 1.3026, the 50% projection.  
Cheers, U2

A little scalp on the 30MIN. Just looking for that 20 pip bounce for some quick pips and/or a chance to move SL to BE for a little more ambitious free roll. Nice ABCD symmetry and a beautiful bounce off the 161FIB

Thanks.  
  
Precisely why I like to scale in. ABCD is nice but not necessary for me to enter. Anyways took 25 pips now short from 129.08 in line with the bigger time frame, the bearish WW on the daily

Never figured out how to scale in. But if it worked for you, dont change it.  
  
I would be careful with the daily WW on gbpusd. I can't see any confluence on that and the bulls are going strong still.  
  
The april 18 candlestick is kinda ruining the setup for me. The symmetry is totally screwed over by that candle. I am skipping this daily WW.

Post #1023 shows the confluence for me. Gann/Fibos. Just booked 30 pips from my short. On the sidelines for now.  
  
Scaling in doesn't have to be complicated. When I have time at my pc I will make a diagram showing a generic way of doing it.

This is super weird because i have my fibs different than yours for the weekly chart.  
  
Have i been using the fib tool wrongly for so many years? Did you draw it wrong or me? Do you mind checking and comparing to your chart?

I'm away from my computer for another 5 hours I'll check then  
  
By the way my USD/JPY short just got filled all 3 positions. Post #1030 shows the scale in limit orders. Just picking a zone that incorporates the ABCD level and using the fib extensions as a guideline.

On October 7th my broker shows a much bigger spike down, that's why the big difference.

I pulled up the 2 hour chart and set the "extdepth" at 3 and there was a nice bullish CWW set up that bounced right off the 141FIB and hit the target line easily.  
  
**GBP/USD 2HOUR CWW - COMPLETED**

GBPUSD 4H Chart:  
Targeting the 1.3000+ levels.  
It also indicates the HEW Wave iv and Wave v Impulse ending waves!  
Amazing!  
Cheers, U2  
  
Edit:  
A question: It looks like the Potential CWW forms once C(4) is valid?

ok. thanks for the answer. I have opened up another broker for the gbp pair. Both also don't have the fibo like yours. Maybe we should compare two different brokers next time.

Maybe Parviz can correct me if I'm wrong.  
  
I think that once the zig zag establishes point "C(4)", then the indicator will show the potential CWW pattern.

Hello Rees. You're welcome brother. God bless you and thanks for posting.  
  
The "sweet" zone as depicted in this diagram is the area  
where price breaks through the XB trend line down to the  
parallel extension line of AC starting at point B. Sounds  
complicated but if you look at the diagram, it's really not.

If you use the indicator that "parviz" so graciously made for us, it basically will map out the sweet zone for you. I wish I had more time at home to explain, but I'll be away form my computer until morning again. Hopefully this helps.  
  
**Note: The reversal point D can be anywhere from the original trend line XB down to the yellow extension line. (and sometimes when there is strong momentum, even farther)**  
  
Here is a CWW that I entered at the end of last week. I ended up booking 100 pips. It's a good example of price reversing in the sweet zone exactly at the 200FIB extension of BC. Sweet zone highlighted as the blue triangle.  
  
I drew this manually so you can hopefully see the realation to the diagram above  
  
**AUD/CHF 4H CWW**

according to this this drawing is a valid CWW , which the indicator would not draw , because X(1) is the first Low when you go back after locating A and B point, indicator would not draw this because, it looks for X according to what the ExtDepth of zigzag dictate.  
I will try to find some kind of solution for that ,but it is really difficult to write an algorithm for that....?  
I will look forward and appreciate any suggestion.  
PS: I know that this makes a reverse (megaphone)WW but it is a valid one and it worked as i noticed in several occasion.and this one :look at zigzag, this one is CWW

I'll try to understand this based on my observation. The X point is actually a very grey area. The more clearer the X point is, the stronger is the signal. In your chart, the X point is actually very forceful. You can say that it's there, you can say it's not. It really varies depends on how you define it. For me, it's not there because if you look further to the left of the chart, it was a nice upswing move. You were simply "forcing" an X there for the setup. Yes, if you switch to a smaller timeframe, it might be there but there's really no point trying to squeeze out a trade. ABCD was definitely there but not the X.  
  
I think some examples from bill wolfe himself are also very unclear because he would simply find those charts with weird X placement. Of course, they worked because they were cherry picking them.  
  
In fact, the chart you posted looked like a gartley pattern.  
  
Anyway, correct me if i am wrong. Still learning also.

GBPUSD 2H Chart:  
Providing the count is correct,  
**it's still on track to reach the 4H and DLY CWW zones.**  
The higher it goes the easier it gets to measure the likely top.   
[Expecting a 5 Wave Impulsive rally which can be measured  
via wave projections.]  
Cheers, U2

> Hi Expo: I noticed that my indicator does now find many of the CWW wave as defined in his book: {quote} {image} according to this this drawing is a valid CWW , which the indicator would not draw , because X(1) is the first Low when you go back after locating A and B point, indicator would not draw this because, it looks for X according to what the ExtDepth of zigzag dictate. I will try to find some kind of solution for that ,but it is really difficult to write an algorithm for that....? I will look forward and appreciate any suggestion. PS: I know...

I don't have that book but is it possible you're misunderstanding what it says?  
  
What your chart shows is the "anti" wave which I deleted from the thread, see diagram below. But I don't think that's what's being described in the quote you posted from the book. I think he is describing exactly what we have been studying, the CWW

Taking a quote from what you posted from the book: **"** The D(5) point is the bottom after point C(4) **and is likely to exceed the extended trend line of X(1) to B(3)."**  
  
The chart you posted doesn't jive with that statement. Not only does price not exceed line X(1) to B(3) but it doesn't even come close to touching that line at all.  
  
Maybe I am missing something but in any event its best if we stick to the classic Wolfe wave structure as in the diagram on post #1. You're indicator is just perfect for our purposes here.  
  
Thoughts?

The book is the same pdf which is on the first post. He suggest and insist, counting the wave in this manner: first look for A then B , then go back and look for X , the low point which point B has surpassed is the X point. Would you please read this phrase again and let me know your idea.

When he picks the X point is irrelevant to what I was saying.  
  
The first chart you posted doesn't converge, which by his own definition isn't a Wolfe wave, and the price at D doesn't even come close to the XB trend line, let alone break through it as he states in his definition  
  
Note: He doesn't actually say that he goes back and picks X after he locates A, he just says that A is the top of the wave

I like the structure so far.  
  
By the way, what kind of indicator are those arrows? Some kind of fractals?

I suppose you could but I prefer to wait until the structure completes as I believe that gives me the highest probability of success.  
  
Here is the same scenario with the Euro. Similar angle with very distinct legs to C(4), and then the structure breaks down. For me, just because C(4) has been established doesn't necessarily mean the CD leg will follow. Everything looked good too. Doji followed by a bullish candle then everything went haywire

I just looked at your chart and i think it's not a wolfe wave setup there on the daily. Your chart is the same as parviz's earlier. The X point is kinda forceful.  
  
Any other opinion?

This is a Cww without doubt.  
  
Remember the most important parts for identify CWW:  
  
**1 X MUST touch C (for me a little difference is allowed)**  
**2 AB=CD closer is better (diff <10%)**  
  
  
sometimes XC will give you a ridiculous TP， you have to adjust by hand...just my 2 cents

Here's how i see it. It's better if you define the clear swings/waves. It is defined by higher low, lower high.  
  
You are just forcing the X to appear in the middle of the swing. Yes i know you can see better if you drop down to H4 timeframe but in my opinion, that is very forceful.  
  
Hope you get what i mean. This is why i said the rules are not clear because bill wolfve himself used an example like this in his book if i am not mistaken.  
  
Also, i don't understand what you mean by X must touch C. C can always be touched by X depending on how you draw it. Look at the two lines i drawn in the chart.

on this chart C > X in all cases, your C point is correct but it is too high for a XC line.

With all due respect, could you please stop posting waves that don't satisfy the requirements of the Classic Wolfe wave. You're saying its "quite close" but it's about 34 pips from even being a horizontal. Where does it end? On a daily "quite close" could mean 100 pips plus? It will only add confusion for new WW traders.  
  
If it works for you, that's fantastic, green pips. But for this thread I ask that you only post WWs that fit the diagram in post #1.  
  
Thanks. I hope that doesn't come off as abrasive or rude. I want this thread to be consistent and easy to understand for new traders as well as the old pros.

A lot of momentum down on the D leg and not very nice symmetry but the 6850 level is a triple bottom on the 4H and a double bottom on the Daily. I'm in and hoping we can get a push back towards 69.

It's not a CWW till D5,

Wave D(5):  
From a 5 Wave Impulsive perspective,   
I can't see that it has peaked.  
[the gap doesn't help]  
It may still have some upside to go.   
Yesterday was extremely Bullish,   
and today looks like consolidation.

Harmonic Elliott Wave,   
5 Wave Impulsive Wave structures [Long and Short].  
  
It looks most likely that CWW Waves AB and CD,  
will be 5 Waves Impulsive.   
This can give us a projection where they may end,  
particularly Wave CD.  
Cheers, U2

Hi MrRijk and welcome to the thread  
  
Looks like you have it right, both are convergent with the proper structure.  
  
Thanks for posting mate. Green pips and great weekend

I've been on the sidelines for this one. I tend to stay away from WWs that are barely convergent. I feel more confident and comfortable when there is a bigger sweet zone.

Thanks for the diagrams U2.  
  
Perfectly illustrates WWs as the end point and reversal point of the impulse wave or as the continuation of the impulse wave?

Both cases are trading corrections.  
1\. The correction after the Impulse Wave  
2\. The correction within the Impulse Wave

That's a great question and I think it depends on any local confluence. I tend to stay on the side lines when I can't see any real immediate confluence. Especially when the CD leg is beyond the completion level. Also, I think the time frame has a lot to do with it. On this WW it would be reasonable to have a 200 pip SL if we were targeting a 600+ pip TP. (better have super small positions though!) Remember the original theory that Mr. Wolfe stated was based on the "physics" of the wave. For each action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Imagine an elastic band being stretched to the point where the momentum finally stops and then releasing all that stored up energy back in the opposite direction. In relating that to a daily price chart, well, it may take a few weeks for price to run out of momentum and re-balance itself. Unfortunately that may be 200+ pips, hence the super small positions and the scale in option.  
  
We've talked about this WW before.  
  
Sorry my chart is a little busy. In analyzing this wave I see that original big booming bullish candle a couple of weeks ago pushing price right into the AB=CD zone, which also happened to be the 200FIB extension of BC and the 61.8FIB from the overall bigger move. Immediately 100 pip re trace. Then looks like a couple of weeks of accumulation.  
  
No we are testing the BC extension 241FIB. In looking at the Gann Fan and the fact that we are now through the 61.8FIB, it looks like 131 may be in play. Any thoughts of me getting short now are off the table.  
  
I would now only consider scaling in short from 130.50-131.50  
  
Cheers, -Kurt

Thanks for all of the good posts this week everyone. I think we are progressing nicely and have covered some really productive topics.  
  
I'm off to chaperon my daughters kindergarten crew for their final field trip. There is nothing like hanging out with a bunch of sugared up 5 year olds to get your mind right. It makes patience in trading seems so easy in comparison.  
  
Have a great weekend everyone. It should be an exciting week ahead with the French election coming up.

Hi :  
The indicator always look for and takes the last newly developed five zigzag points as the basis for analysis , in your picture at least 4 new zigzag point has been developed after the D(5) point already, i am sure that it has found it before when the 5th point was newly developed.

OH yes that is far from the standard definition of classic WW, are you using the last version 8.5 ?, if it is so then i have posted it by mistake ,indeed that was the version that i was keeping for myself just to check how far the CD may extend as an experimental version. If it is version 8.5 then i will replace it, so that it doesn't cause any confusion....

Hello Kurt,  
Thank you for a really nice thread. You and Parviz are doing a great job trying to help us all make some Money.  
I have a question regarding Gann fan. How do you determine where to put your start, and where/how do you spread it´s "wings"?

Hi Guran01.  
  
The first thing you need to know is that the Gann fan I'm using is actually the Fib Fan tool with modified inputs. I'm fairly inexperienced at using Gann fans but from doing some research it's necessary to have you're chart "squared" so the levels stay true.  
  
Basically, you need to put a fib fan on your chart and then add these levels and description (the levels are the angles that have been converted into radians)  
  
Then, use the "trend line by angle" tool to put a 45 degree line on your chart from the starting point you want to use. Then use that new modified fib fan and make sure the 1x1 line is on the 45 degree line.  
  
Where you draw them is subjective. Bigger time frames I believe carry more significance.  
  
I made this chart so it would be easy for anyone interested.Here are the levels you need to add to your fib fan tool with matching descriptions:

I know this chart is a bit cluttered but here is an example of one I'm looking at for this week. I have one fan from the bigger wave down and one from the most recent wave down

You're welcome mate.  
  
Taking the WW indicator off the chart and just looking at the Gann fans with previous S/R, well that would be a short trade in itself. When time and price and intersect that precisely, one has to wonder, is it a coincidence? Many traders will say that all those silly lines mean nothing but I beg to differ.

Thanks Parviz.  
  
As an example here: It still shows an old wave. Is it because it broke down at point C. Just curious why it still shows up

Hi Kurt:  
Just one zigzag has been formed after the D(5), apparently the zigzag algorithm still does not believe a well formed swing point is formed....?!!  
You know some of these problem are not mine, my indicator just gets the last 5 point which is in zigzag buffer and do the calculation on that basis, in your chart the last point in zigzag buffer was the D(5) point, may be a few minute later, as soon as it appears in the buffer it will be changed,and it will not be shown any more...!? (the new zigzag point as the 5th one ,does not fit CWW definition any more)

I definitely don't look at it as a "problem". I was just curious. The indicator functions beautifully and is immensely helpful!

Finally after about a month of coding and recoding this is the new ParvizCWW indicator, as it is seen in the name, it is just a trial version, only for those who are interested to help me in improving it.  
Please don't trust it , I know that it has still many bugs, and deficiencies, just try it and compare its finding with the standard, bug free version 8.5, and let me know the results.  
Writing the code is one story and finding the bugs is another more time consuming process, i alone can not find and fix all, it needs your cooperation.

I forgot to mention how it is working:  
1) It automatically looks and find every possible CWW (Potential and Completed), for all 6 ExtDepth that you entered in the input.  
2)It draws all findings on the same chart and assign a clickable button for each of them.  
3) you can view and have the characteristic of any of them by clicking its button.  
4)Since the indicator halts after each new run, whenever you like you can force it to research again by clicking the corresponding "SEARCH AGAIN" button.  
5)Below is an example chart of GBPUSD 15 minute chart.

Wow, this is really amazing!  
  
One question to start. Why does the green triangle show up? Does it have to do with where the zig zag prints the D location?

hi:  
No just in completed CWW , it will draw the Sweet Zone Triangle , in potential ones it does not.  
Indeed yes , when the D touches or pass the line1_3

Thanks. I understand.  
  
**Question #2:** What does it take for the indicator to recognize that a potential wave has violated the WW parameters.  
  
Version5 shows this potential 4H wave extdepth = 6

The trial version shows an older wave on the 4H that has clearly broken down and violated the WW parameters. It doesn't show the new potential wave. I'm assuming it's because the zig zag hasn't printed any new points. So as in my question above, when will the indicator abandoned the invalid wave and move on to new zig zag points and new potential waves

Ha Ha : This is one of the bugs that i have noticed ,trial version finds wave that are already old....!!  
I am looking to find the problem, still unsuccessful.  
the other thing i want you to know is that, i did not implement any condition to invalidate a potential CWW after it has gone the other way around.  
You know what : i have rewritten about half of the codes since version 8.5 ,and this means >600 line of code, i am missing something, somewhere that i was not able to find in logic of the algorithm.  
The problem is that it only does that in some instances and not alwayes and this makes it more difficult to find the bug.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f634.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f634.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f644.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f629.png?v=15.1)

I see.  
  
So basically in the example I posted, the invalid wave will preclude the zig zag from printing any new points?

Hi Kurt:  
Finally I have found the bug causing inconsistency between the version 8.5 and trial version , it was in closure of one "For loop" ,which was different .  
Here i explain now, how the points X to D is selected and analysed, i believe that this will answer all of your questions, which i was not able to clarify before correctly:  
1)After zigzag finish, program select the last 5 point in the array, and check them for any valid CWW(both potential and completed), if found then, it move to the next ExtDepth.  
2) If it does not find any then, it would shift all X to D point one zigzag value to the left and look for a valid CWW , and it will continue to do that, for 5 times (which at the end of this loop, the first D point has replaced the first X), meanwhile if at any point it find any CWW,it draw it and skip to the next depth.  
3) If even after these 5 shift again it does not find any CWW again it will go to the next depth.  
4) making the long discussion short, it does not look for the last 5 zigzag values ,but instead in the last 10 value, and for five times, i would say.   
I hope that this explanation was simple enough for every one to understand.  
Soon i will post a bug free version of the last indicator.

Hi Tbuild, thanks for posting.  
  
Interesting. I didn't even notice the WW on the DXY 1H. According to Mr. Wolfe, the bigger time frames take precedence over the smaller time frames. It will be interesting to see what happens if/when we get down to the 98 area.  
  
I also have the USD/CHF setup on my radar.  
  
I like the way you've posted your setups. Clear and well mapped out. It makes the discussion so much easier.  
  
Greens pips going forward

@Parviz  
  
Is there a way to have the potential wave disappear after it has been invalidated.  
  
For example below. A higher low has been made thus breaking the parameters for a WW.

Dear kurt:  
Since you had tonight to examine the work of indicator, i have thought about this logic:  
If at any point, any candle, from the candle of C(4) to the current candle, closes above the close of C(4),then that potential wave would not be valid(Buy CWW) , and the reverse of that for the (Sell CWW).  
  
Do you think that would be a reasonable logic....?  
  
If so here it is the new indicator for you...

PS:  
8) Don't forget to click the search again button every now and then, since the indicator stop finding any new changes, when it draws them once.

Yes that seems like the right logic.  
  
I found this with the 9.6 version though. Potential wave still showing after candle closed above point C and the zig zag is off as well.

**EDIT: So far this script has only worked on 1 out of 3 meta4 platforms which is strange considering they all have the same build version.**  
  
If anyone likes to scale in like I do, here are two nice scripts that are simple to use.  
  
Credit and thanks to member "Aad" for sharing these for free. Original thread with PDF instructions here: <https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=151391>

**  
  
I like to zero in on a particular zone for my entries so scaling in is my preferred style.  
  
Here's a demo example. In the inputs it's really easy. Just pick the starting price and lot size per order. Then select 3,5, or 10 positions by setting the one you want to "true". Select how many pips between orders. Also select SL and TP pip size. That's it. Once you see the orders on the chart, you can drag and drop to adjust the entry price, SL, or TP if you want. Saves so much time.

That CAD/CHF is a thing of beauty. Well done of you traded it.  
  
Technically the GBP/AUD isn't a Wolfe wave as it's diverging. Ironically I am short based on massive Fibonacci confluence across multiple time frames. Of course the AB=CD on the 4H just adds another layer of confluence.

Look at this what a nice symmetry, the problem is that price has passed both sweet zones, it its not a valid CWW according to the definition.

I'm not sure that's quite true according to Mr. Wolfe. I never read anything about exactly how far price has to go beyond the sweet zone to become invalid. Consider a daily time frame with a 100 pip stop loss or more. We're still going to be in the trade likely when price is beyond the sweet zone.  
  
But I realize the indicator has to abandon the WW at some point so it makes sense to set it up that way. It's up to the trader to have located the wave in advance using the indicator and then make their decision accordingly as far as where to enter and where to put the SLs.

That was then a 50-complete, now it is a 20-complete and a perfect valid one with bad symmetry...!!.

A nice clean wave so far with nice symmetry. Ill be waiting to pounce on this one if price makes it into the scale in zone. Notice the previous S/R

Hi kurt:  
The problem of a shifting of zigzag line was because the indicator was stopping when it search all the depth once.  
In this version , program is always running and it does not stop to find new CWW (and so will repaint ), unless you press any of the button to view a specific one , once you click any of these buttons the indicator halts,and let you do your analysis on the drawing, when you are finished with it, then just pressing the "Search Again" will restart the indicator.(in this picture of you, the problem has appeared because the program was in Halt and did not redraw)

Hi kurt and everybody:  
Since this last version, is always running and do a lot of calculation on each run, it would use a lot of your CPU time, especially if multiple instances of it are on different pairs , so i suggest as soon as it finds the patterns , press one of the buttons so that program stop searching , and if you need it again, rerun it by clicking "search again" button, this way your computer will not be slow.

I agree. Analyzing and learning from losing trades is a trait most successful traders have.

Identifying wolfe waves manually is not an easy task, many are invalidated, making this also a time consuming task, the indicator surely is a big help but IMHO it should only be used once one is comfortable in identifying them on a naked chart in few seconds because there will be formations that the indicator won't detect or other formations that are not very good and require some discretionary selection.  
So I guess, newbies prefer the shiny indicator based approach ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
But I think the biggest factor for little posts is that very few are having success.  
So how is it working for you guys? Just a honest question.  
  
Personally I'm not trading WW directly, still working on a little variation I call contrarian wave.  
Looking to eventually post a bit more here and maybe we can help each other to find consistent success.  
  
By the way, what happened to the anti wolfe wave? Had some merits, was it removed to not cause confusion or because it's not working as good as the classic WW?  
  
Anyway, one of the good threads here on FF, please keep going. 

the 3rd wave is the crowd's wave

i do believe this is the most profitable way of trading i have ever seen in five years...  
  
and this is not a comment which i give lightly, the fact proves everything.  
  
if you really want to trade with high profit ratio, you come to the right place.

Hi Expo,  
When I was posting set-ups I thought exactly the same, especially of those people who were more than happy to pass judgement on others' set ups.  
  
I do like this thread, and I think Parviz has done an amazing job with his indicator (kudos to you Parviz!). I actually got a demo account for Tradestation just so that I could see it in action and I think I would find it really useful if I traded Wolfe Waves per se.  
  
I have stopped posting much because I use price action analysis rather than retracement levels to look for entries and that is beyond the scope of this thread.  
  
Cheers  
Stuart

Hi Stuart. Thanks for dropping by.  
  
Greens pips to you my friend. I wasn't offended that not many charts were being posted. I just think it helps all of us by seeing what does and doesn't work. Plus, time constraints makes it hard to find all the potential waves. When someone posts a wave that I haven't detected yet its really nice. Then myself and others can pull up that chart and see if our own personal filtering system fits that wave well enough to take a trade. I think we covered a lot of topics and have all learned from each other. Maybe we all even got a bit sidetracked, but that's a good thing. I think now it's time to get back to the basics.  
  
Cheers, -Kurt

Well said my friend.  
  
Yes, I removed the anti wave from the thread as it just seemed to add confusion, especially for new traders. Probably a bad idea by me from the start.

Hi Rees.  
  
Not really gone wrong just entered to soon and as a result your stop loss isn't going to work. I posted this same wave on post #1154. Please check it out. So far I only got two small positions filled out of a possible eleven. Hopefully price will move higher and fill up my orders  
  
Imho, scaling in shouldn't have started until at least 78.60 up to about 79.00 with SL at least 79.20 ish  
  
The AB=CD completion price isn't until 78.85. Please check out the chart below and notice the previous S/R and where the scale in zone is. Also notice the BC fib extension and larger FIB from the overall move

The indicator couldn't pick this one up because the D leg was too choppy, but I've been tracking this one manually for a couple of weeks. Most traders would ask why try to catch a falling knife. Well, I've always been a contrarian trader and probably always will be.  
  
Anyways, here's the theory behind the madness.  
  
1) AB=CD symmetry of length perfectly matches up with the 200FIB extension of BC  
2) AB=CD candle symmetry is also very good  
3) AB=CD completion also happens to be right at the 4x1 Gann fan level. Gann levels bring in the element of time which to me is very powerful.  
4) AB=CD completion level is also about 20 pips from the completion of a Quasimodo pattern (sounds pretty fancy huh)  
  
Anyways, the Aussie fundamentals of late have been less than desirable. Accordingly price has been under pressure for the last 6 weeks. However,I think this trade offers good risk reward value.  
  
Sorry if the chart is a little cluttered. I wanted to show the entries, TPs, SLs, FIB and Gann fan

Yes to do nothing.  
Let it is not WW, but 3 drive.  
Other authors say that WW = 3 DRIVE   
The truth will be in the middle.

So, what you mean is that the 3 drive wave is the same as CWW ,less the 1st leg .....???(which is not drawn by indicator)  
Then good for me it also covers this 3 drive concepts....![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)

1\. Optimum wave: the lines drawn through tops 1-3 and 2-4 in the long term are crossed, time of formation of 3-5 tops makes about 2/3 times of formation of tops 1-3

OK , what i have got from these drawings is that  
1)The time from point 1 to point 3 (b period) , always in all cases are equal to the time forming the max profit point(green line)from point D.  
2)If i draw a parallel line to line 1-3 , starting from point 2 , it roughly gives me a point on the profit line that i may take my first profit by closing part of the trade and keep the rest to travel more (up to the maximum level of labeled take profit) and it has a measurable characteristic(the point,where it ends, is calculable) .  
3)Is that correct ..? do you believe if i add this parallel line to the indicator, it would be helpful ...?

I think the converging might be wrong...  
  
Should we take trade only in(or near) converging area?

I tend to stay way from smaller time frames but I couldn't resist this little scalp attempt. Just trying to pick up 20 pips while risking 10.

Yes I noticed that smaller wave as well but as I said the indi doesn't pick up the larger wave in play because of the choppy price action on the D leg. None of the exdepth settings will allow the zig zag to find the wave. I believe the bigger wave takes precedence over the smaller wave. The one I posted is a exactly at AB=CD so not overstretched as in the smaller wave you posted.  
  
So far resistance has held up. Green pips going forward  
  
Cheers

**NZD/JPY 4H CWW UPDATE**  
  
This is how it supposed to work in a perfect world. Price rejected exactly at AB=CD which used to be support but has now turned to resistance. Although ABCD candle symmetry isn't perfect the price action on both waves was fairly smooth. Now with 9 scaled in small positions I have some micro management opportunities. We are 50 pips or so from the ABCD completion level so we can bank some profits and adjust some SLs if desired.

Ignoring the not so good symmetry, what do you think about these?  
Is it forcing a WW on a chart or maybe some sort of "secret" explained only in his course?

those are example charts by Bill Wolfe, as far as I can see it, they are all converging, am I missing something?

No, that is not a clear X point. You are just finding working examples of the X point. Sorry to be harsh but this is forcing the trade to happen. It is quite clear the price dropped from above. Even if you drop down to 5minute charts, it's also very unclear.  
  
But not to blame you because i've seen examples of this from bill wolve himself.  
  
Look at the first two SP chart you posted, he was just forcing the X to happen. There was no clear high and low for those two charts.  
  
In fact, if you look at this S&P chart posted, isn't the X/1 should be higher?

I completely agree with you on how it should be, I'm just wondering why he does this ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1), Bill Wolfe must be knowing what he is doing ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f644.png?v=15.1)  
Most of the examples from his book or website have weird X points.  
This is what he writes about the easiest way to find the starting x (1) point

XAUUSD 15M Chart:  
I'm looking for a Higher Low,  
to signal a trend reversal [to Long].  
From a wave count perspective,  
it needs one more low to complete a wave ii correction.  
This would take it into the green 'sweet zone'.

No it's not. Point B needs to make a lower low from point X.  
  
Also, The first chart you posted shouldn't be a "lose" because the wave was invalidated at point C

Not pretty but a winner nonetheless.  
  
Price only declined about 10 pips below AB=CD then ultimately reversed back 80 pips or so exactly to the pip to the target line

Thanks mate. May I ask what platform you are using?   
  
I was messing around with some Renko charts last week but when you have many Renko charts up on meta4 it can get bogged down and really slow.

I use ProRealTime charts.   
Would you show me how to get Renko on MT4.   
I know it's a bit tricky.

Interesting idea using Renko, have to check this out ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
  
But don't forget the wicks, important piece of information, especially for the sweet zone, this Renko EA shows also the wicks:

How to set up:  
1\. Drop the EA file in the "mql4/Experts" folder  
2\. Start MT4, open a **1m chart** of any pair (example EURUSD)  
3\. Drag and drop the renko EA from the expert list on the EURUSD 1m chart  
4\. A text note should appears saying something like "open offline chart M2 EURUSD"  
5\. File -> Open offline chart -> select the time frame as shown by the EA (EURUSD M2)

I also have the pimped version and sometimes set wicks to false. Problem for me is my meta4 platform always seems to freeze up when I'm using Renko and my computer is fairly new

Hi mate.  
  
You're "X" point is in the wrong place. Based on that point, then line XB and AC are diverging. To be a valid Wolfe wave those two lines need to be converging.  
  
It might not seem like much of a difference, but it really is. For one, the valid wave that I posted below has the "D" point about 10 pips lower than yours. As a result, any fibo analysis or any other confluence analysis may not be valid or consistent within the parameters of Wolfe wave theory. Keep practicing and posting my friend and it will become very natural and easy  
  
Also, this is where Parviz' indicator is so useful. Just put it on the chart, fiddle with the zig zag setting and BOOM, there is the valid wave  
  
See below where the starting point "X" should be  
  
Cheers

Today is a classic example of a day where the market as a whole seems to be in a harmonic flow. Almost every pair I pull up and look at has a WW nearing completion or a valid wave heading towards the target line.  
  
These are the type of days that can "make the month" if you are prepared in advance with good risk management in place

You're welcome Rees, it's my pleasure.  
  
This is the first night I've had some real screen time, just made way too many commitments outside the home. It's nice to be able to focus on the thread and to be able to take advantage of some really good trading opportunities

Time for some rest. Have this one set, maybe it will get filled on a good PPI print coming up in a few minutes.

Wow, we had a 30 pip surge down. Looks like some SLs were taken out, but and immediate 20 pin bar ensued. Seems there was some good demand down towards 147.  
  
Order filled and a good example of being prepared and having our stops in the right place. Survived the initial onslaught, now we see if the market will re-balance itself  
  
That's all for me tonight. Green pips around!

Got 3 out of 4 positions filled and then an 80 pip plummet which reached all three TPs. Instant gratification. If only every trade went this well.

Hi Rees,  
  
I hope you ended up taking this trade as the AB=CD candle and price symmetry was near perfection. Price bounced precisely at the 127FIB which is right at AB=CD. Now price has moved 40 pips into the green. And that's all I'm we're really looking for in many of these trades; a bounce in price which gives us the opportunity to take some profits, move the rest of the position to BE and then let it run if desired.  
  
Cheers

**The latest stable versions of parvizCww indicator are 3, each with different characteristics:**  
  
**1)version 8.5:** Is a manual one, you click the button and select which depth and either complete or potential CWW is what you want.  
  
**2)version 9.6:** Is automated one, it looks for all possible combination and when it finds them draw a button for each so that you may select which one you are interested in, and it shows you its characteristics. In this version when the indicator find all the possible patterns, it stops and does look for them only once, if you want to see the latest ones press "**Search Again** " button .(indicator does not repaint)  
  
**3)version 9.6.1** : Basically is the same as 9.6, except that, it does not stop searching after finding CWW, and always look for new ones as they are developing and thus "Repaint", if you want to halt the program, by clicking button for any pattern, program stop searching and so you can examine the selected pattern as long as you want, without losing it, if it find a new pattern. By clicking "**Search Again** " button,you may restart the indicator again.(this version uses a lot of the CPU time,since it is always running and doing a lot of calculations .)  
  
I ask kurt ,if it is possible ,to put all these versions in the first post, plus this explanation to help all the users.

Yes, I definitely will put all 3 on the first post. I think I may have reached the limit for uploads on post#1 but I can reorganize to make it work.  
  
I have 8.5 still but I want to make sure I have the right ones for 9.6 and 9.6.1. Are they the ones posted on post #1205? If not can you post them here so I can put them all together on post #1  
  
Thanks mate. Great idea. This will give everyone an option that suits there needs

Hoping this get filled up. Finally figured out why the scaling in script wasn't working on my [Oanda](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile") meta4 platform. I'm pretty excited to be able to save so much time scaling into positions.

I'm wondering if anyone else's computer is getting lag when having multiple charts up with the WW indicator on it because my computer is lagging really bad. Really frustrating considering it's only about 18 months old.  
  
Anyways, I am using the indicator to scan pairs then manually drawing the wave so I can track multiple pairs without having the computer freeze up.  
  
**Anatomy of a trade before an important news event.**  
  
This morning's US CPI and retail sales prints could potentially move the market 30-50 pips. Maybe it won't but that's not the point. I'm neither bearish nor bullish on USD/JPY which in essence for me is irrelevant. My strategy is to be prepared and waiting for the price to come into my zone. I never want to be scrambling at the last minute trying to initiate a trade by just shooting form the hip like a wild west gunslinger. This is a methodical method planned in advance. All I have to do is sit back and wait. In the meantime, if the WW breaks down, I just cancel all the orders and forget about it.  
  
Basically, I am hoping the US data disappoints and becomes the catalyst for a price spike down into my zone.  
  
**NOTE:** The most important aspect of the trade is where to put the limit orders and where to put the SLs. The trade needs room to breath, especially if you're trying to fill up orders on a news spike. The TPs are preset but not really important at this point. They are subject to micromanagement if/when the trade goes in my favor.

Now price has moved 40 pips into the green. And that's all I'm we're really looking for in many of these trades; a bounce in price which gives us the opportunity to take some profits, move the rest of the position to BE and then let it run if desired.

I rarely trade AUD/NZD as price tends to be too choppy but I like this set up.  
  
Fundamentally, I think the 200 pip Aussie gain here is a bit overcooked. All because of the RBNZ keeping the rate the same in addition to some dovish rhetoric.  
  
I'm short at 1.08 off the retest of the 200FIB extension of BC which also matches up to the pip with the 61.8FIB from the larger wave down. Throw in a Gann level and the 1.08 round number and I can't resist  
  
Some would say a bull flag but perhaps it's a bull trap

> I'm wondering if anyone else's computer is getting lag when having multiple charts up with the WW indicator on it because my computer is lagging really bad. Really frustrating considering it's only about 18 months old. Anyways, I am using the indicator to scan pairs then manually drawing the wave so I can track multiple pairs without having the computer freeze up. Anatomy of a trade before an important news event. This morning's US CPI and retail sales prints could potentially move the market 30-50 pips. Maybe it won't but that's not the point....

Indeed, my hope for a dissapointing US data print this morning came true and as a result price dropped right into my fill zone. Three of five positions were filled.

Stripping away the trade levels etc to see the simple concept behind the fill level zone. We can see the initial price drop, then the attempt to bounce, then the second little price wave down to the confluence level.  
  
This trade may still be a loser in the end but as a trader I've done my homework and my job by being prepared in advance. In the context of Wolfe wave theory, I have used my personal filtering system to preset a high probability zone of potential reversal. The local demand zone (orange circle) is quite obvious. The fact that it perfectly matches up with the 141 BC extension FIB, the .50FIB of the larger move, and a Gann fan level, well, that may be a coincidence, but I don't believe that for a second. To me a price chart is like a living organism that's inner workings are controlled by human behavior, and I believe that behavior can be modeled by the mathematics of geometry, time and space.

Hi Ace.  
  
I had to remove the original template from post #1 because I reached the limit for attachments.  
  
Here is the original template.  
  
**NOTE:** The Wolfe wave indicator in this template is the 8.5 version. You can change it and use the 9.6 or 9.6.1 version if you want, they are on post #1. Also, I find that with all of the indicators, especially the newest Wolfe wave version, the meta4 can start lagging a bit. So you can modify it as you like

Hope everyone is enjoying their weekend.  
  
Thought I'd get this week started by going through my pre-trade filtering process. There is no right or wrong way to do this. The process should be personal, but it needs to be done every time you take a trade.  
  
Ok, so you put the WW indicator on a chart and you see a potential WW. In our example, the wave is pretty steep, a little rough around the edges, nothing too special. Just one of dozens and dozens of WWs that are forming during the week. So, why would we choose to trade or not trade this wave? Well, we can't answer that question without going through our personal filtering process.  
  
Below is the potential wave without any filters. Just the naked wave detected by the indicator.  
  
**NZD/CAD 1H POTENTIAL CWW - NAKED**  
**

**  
  
**THE FILTERING PROCESS**  
  
I always check 4 things no matter what when I detect a potential wave. Again, each trader has their own set of tools. I have many, but these 4 are checked before EVERY trade.  
  
1) Previous S/R  
2) The BC extension FIB  
3) The FIB retracement levels from the larger, most recent move  
4) The Gann Fan  
  
In our example, I've taken all of the structure trend lines off the chart along with the zig zag just so that it's easier to see the filters and comments. I started naked with only the two blue triangles that outline the potential wave. Then I added the filters  
  
Here is the final chart with analysis below:  
  
**NZD/CAD 1H POTENTIAL CWW - WITH FILTERS**  
**

**  
  
1) Notice the previous S/R. What sticks out most to me is the fact that price seems to accelerate when it's passing through resistance levels 1 and 2. So it stands to reason IF price breaks through resistance level 1, then it may accelerate towards level 2. Notice each time price moved through this zone, there are pretty large candles. This is a good thing. We want price to reach point D. Even better if it's accelerating. Remember the physics theory that Bill Wolfe quoted: "for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction". And that's what we want. We want that elastic band to stretch to the limit (point D) before running out of momentum, then all of that stored up energy can be released in the opposite direction, the direction of our trade.  
  
2) Point D is exactly the 261.8FIB extension of BC  
  
3) Point D is exactly the 61.8FIB retracement level of the biggest and most recent move  
  
4) The 2x1 Gann fan line exactly intersects at point D. Remember Gann fans bring in the element of time. The only way point D can intersect that Gann line perfectly is if the CD leg of the wave has the same number of candles as the AB leg (again time is of the essence here) Remember the indicator draws the waves assuming it will have perfect candle symmetry between AB and CD. It looks like about 14 candles for the AB leg so price would have to reach point D in about 14 hours from market open to be exactly in that D circle. (That would be pretty amazing if you ask me). Still, a few hours less or more and it would be fairly close.  
  
**NOTE:** Resistance level 2 is basically in line with our 2 confluent FIB levels.  
  
Sorry if this seems like an endless rant, but I feel it's absolutely vital to trading these waves successfully. I hope traders will take the time to look at the chart and compare it to what I'm saying. Look at the first chart. Looks like random price action. Put WW theory and a filtering system in place and you get chart 2. Now price doesn't look quite that random.  
  
Also note, I will be scaling in a bit early as I like to do. Probably 5 positions 2-3 pips apart. With seemingly so much resistance heading into point D, I like to make sure I get at least a few small positions filled.  
  
Having gone through all of this analysis, the market could open up tomorrow and price could just drift lower and completely invalidate this wave before it actually comes to fruition. Or, price could make it to D and then an OPEC member could unexpectedly make a statement that they are increasing supply, thus oil price plummets, thus sending NZD/CAD price 100 pips higher blowing up our trade. Both scenarios are irrelevant to our plan. We can't predict if price will go lower tomorrow and we can't predict what an OPEC member will unexpectedly say. What we can do, is locate a high probability zone where price may reverse based on Wolfe wave theory coupled with a well thought out filtering system.  
  
I hope this post will open trader's eyes to the possibilities. You are only limited by your imagination and your willingness to do the hard work. Be meticulous, be patient, and be confident that your trading endeavors will become reality.  
  
Remember, CONFLUENCE IS KING!  
  
Safe and prosperous trading going forward friends.

One question tough, how do you personally draw the fan angles?  
Do you use High/lows of a move or do you look for the angles to fit previous price bounces, or just 45 degree?  
In the last case, do you square time and price before (by adjusting the scale)?

@ Expo  
You may, in time, want to think about putting a reference or link (is that possible?) to your excellent post 1286 on the front page of the thread. IMHO, a strategy for filtering out high probability trades is exactly what the doctor ordered for the Wolfe Wave strategy given that so many trading opportunities set up. The key is to look for highly visible support and resistance levels and you have the nearest ones covered with your resistance zones. The confluence effect cannot be stressed enough and you have done a fabulous job of giving Wolfe Wave traders some boxes to tick so that they may have confidence in taking any particular trade. Good job, sir! After all, institutions move the markets and the likelihood of them trading Wolfe Waves is remote at best. Therefore, in order to get your strategy trade moving, there has to be really good reasons why other participants would enter the market and propel it to your profit targets. Confluence obviously gives more reasons why others would enter the market.  
  
I have been developing my own price action strategy for some time now and have dissected trade set ups into their various components based on things that I want to watch out for. For instance if I'm looking at the various characteristics of a pullback in a trend, some things I may look for would be 50% pullback (0 or 1) or a pullback to the 20ema (o or 1). Using an Excel spreadsheet for this analysis is extremely powerful as, by the time one has looked at 200 trades or so with many criteria for each trade based on prior price action and the pullback sequence as well as entry, exit, win, lose, R-multiple profit (and loss - which should not exceed 1!), there is a good bit of data that can be queried in whatever way you like. The results can be very surprising and give the trader a few really key features to look for in order to find trades that have as much as 60-75% probability. I would suggest, if other traders can be bothered, that a similar type of analysis is carried out for Wolfe Waves. Criteria such as those in Expo's filtering system would be a good start to the column headings / criteria, but there could be many others too - again your imagination is the only thing limiting the process. This type of exercise also ensures the trader records all of his/her trades and gives the trader a great deal of exposure to different looking set ups. It is easy to do manual backtesting on this type of strategy too, albeit time-consuming. It is a marathon, not a sprint....  
  
From a Price action perspective I really like the USDJPY setup that was posted (Expo I think) last week; for example, there is a bull channel on the H4 / H8 and price has pulled back to the trend line and also had a >50% PB from the high of the move. There are other reasons too, but for me there is great confluence there.  
  
Wishing you all a very profitable week ahead.  
Stuart

Thanks Juri.  
  
Yes, I draw the 45 degree line from the beginning of an impulse wave that I deem has relevance to area of interest.I think drawing the Gann fan is subjective to some extent. In the NZD/CAD example it's pretty obvious where it should be drawn. In many cases, however, the last impulse wave isn't so distinct. Many times I draw multiple fans just to see if any patterns emerge. I also like to check the higher time frames.  
  
I'm still a novice when it comes to Gann fans but from what I've researched, it's hard to truly square time and price on the Meta 4 platform. I use the Fibonacci fan tool and add all of the levels manually with the corresponding converted angles. The fan doesn't stayed squared when changing time frames or when you're zooming in and out but it will remain squared when you go back to the original time frame and when you zoom back to where you originally drew the fan.  
  
These are the converted angles with corresponding levels that I manually set in the Fibonacci fan tool

Very nice post my friend. I'm going to add the post to the first page along with some others that have some extra significance. I've been pressed for time since the beginning of this thread. I promised myself that I would scale back my commitments heading into next year.  
  
The spreadsheet seems like a super productive exercise and very time consuming! There's no room for laziness in forex as you know.

I stumbled upon this WW on the EUR/NZD weekly.  
  
Let's break it down. Two things I notice on the weekly chart:  
  
1) Point D near previous S/R  
2) A doji followed by a hanging man (pretty bearish in my opinion considering the time frame)  
  
**EUR/NZD WEEKLY CWW**

Here's the daily chart with a look at some Gann fans. Possible price containment to the upside. Imo, not totally conclusive. This is a volatile pair so 100 pips either way on the bigger time frames is very possible.

Here's a look at the FIB analysis on the daily chart. Imo, very powerful. Three FIB levels coincide closely with point D. All within 15 pips of each other on a daily time frame for this pair? That's something that should raise one's eyebrows.  
  
1) 61.8FIB retracement from most recent and pertinent big move. (red)  
2) 241FIB extension of BC (yellow)  
3) 200FIB extension of XA (green)

And the icing on the cake is a retest of the completion point of a bearish Quasimodo pattern (up and under pattern). Here's a look at that on the 4H time frame

**Longer term fundamental perspective:** I think NZs economic issues are way less complex than the Euro economy and should be easier to manage. I also believe that Mr. Wheeler of the RBNZ has been forthright in his rhetoric. He's basically done exactly what he said he would do. And of course, the carry trade for larger entities would likely remain attractive going forward into 2018.  
  
Imho, small positions with a fairly large SL could yield some big pips over the next couple of months

I've been pressed for time since the beginning of this thread. I promised myself that I would scale back my commitments heading into next year. The spreadsheet seems like a super productive exercise and very time consuming! There's no room for laziness in forex as you know. Cheers, -Kurt

Hi Kurt,  
Actually, I generally trade the FTSE (UKX) 5min chart so my strategy evolution and analysis is based on a couple of years of those charts plus another timeframe. The aim is to get it going well on that and then move on to the infinitely more liquid EURUSD as and when I have looked into the idiosyncracies of that instrument on the 5min timeframe. Currently getting all of the relevant charts saved when I can. Every instrument has its own behavior in terms of what works well as technical S / R, how deep the pullbacks are - including how much a genuinely sensible stop might be taken out by before the move continues etc etc. However, your post regarding the USDJPY Wolfe Wave spurred me to take a look at the setup and has got me doing a reasonable amount of work over the weekend on higher timeframe Fx charts to see if I can add them to my strategy trade plan. TBH I would have liked to have seen the pullback go a little deeper (at least to 11313 which would be a double bottom on the H8 according to ProRealTime charts) as I can't see any robust technical support that has kicked in yet on the H8 apart from (with rose-tinted spectacles) maybe an inferred breakout test of a lower timeframe swing high pivot (11330) based on an upper tail . I can see it on lower timeframe charts, but I generally like to at least be able to strongly infer it on the timeframe that I am trading (tails on bars etc). I'm thinking that we will maybe get another small leg down, but a swing stop should contain it if the bull trend on this timeframe is to continue.  
  
The spreadsheet is time-consuming, but it is as ongoing dynamic piece of work so it doesn't have to feel like an arduous task. Even starting one now, after a bit of thought as to what one wants to look for, and updating it with real-time trades rather than 'boring' backtesting may soon give enough data to become statistically significant for Wolfe Wavers. The power of this approach should not be underestimated!   
  
Also FWIW, I see your 'bearish Quasimodo pattern' - sorry, never heard of it! - as an expanding triangle or I believe some people call it a megaphone (?) where there is a concurrent bull trend (Higher highs) and bear trend (lower lows) and therefore a trading range. I would generally expect the prior HH to be taken out given the strength of the bull spike at the start of the 4th leg, but the market is full of surprises and I may very well be wrong.  
  
Green pips to all.  
Stuart

Ironic that you mentioned you'd like to see UJ at least at 113.13. About an hour ago I pulled up UJ on [www.xe.com](http://www.xe.com) and it was showing a gap down to 113.13. It has since moved up a bit but technically you got your 113.13!

In the NZD/CAD example it's pretty obvious where it should be drawn. In many cases, however, the last impulse wave isn't so distinct. Many times I draw multiple fans just to see if any patterns emerge. I also like to check the higher time frames. I'm still a novice when it comes to Gann fans but from what I've researched, it's hard to truly square time and...

Hi Kurt:  
I am not sure what exactly you mean by square chart, if you mean that the X (Time) to Y (price) Ratio be one to one ..?  
then it can be done easly on changing it ratio to 1:1 in property of the chart context menu....? or this is not what you mean...?  
And as you know, usually while the time is linearly changing, price scale is exponential, and being so it is very difficult to estimate the necessary 45 degree angle for the fist Gann line.

What I mean is that when you change time frames or zoom in/out the 45 degree line will stay at 45 degrees but the 1x1 fan line won't stay on that 45 degree line  
  
With the Meta 4 platform, the reality is that you can't truly square your Gann fan using the Fib fan tool. At least that's what it seems from reading all of the information I could find on the subject. At the very least, I just want the fan to come back to the same original position after changing time frames and zooming in/out so I don't have to redraw the 45 degree line and the Fib fan all over again.  
  
There's a good discussion here by "Mastermind" whose knowledge on the subject dwarfs anything I could ever know. Post #8 is where the discussion starts.

> I rarely trade AUD/NZD as price tends to be too choppy but I like this set up. Fundamentally, I think the 200 pip Aussie gain here is a bit overcooked. All because of the RBNZ keeping the rate the same in addition to some dovish rhetoric. I'm short at 1.08 off the retest of the 200FIB extension of BC which also matches up to the pip with the 61.8FIB from the larger wave down. Throw in a Gann level and the 1.08 round number and I can't resist Some would say a bull flag but perhaps it's a bull trap AUD/NZD 1H CWW {image}

Held over the weekend and now we have a nice free roll situation. In the green 30-40 pips now to see where London takes this. All SLs moved to BE.  
  
Don't want to toot my own horn (actually I did play the trumpet in middle school), but just want to show how effective WW theory can be. We aren't trying to make any bold predictions about lasting trend reversals. All we are doing is capitalizing on a market structure that is out of balance with the physics and geometry of price. That may sound ridiculous to many professional traders but to each his own. All we are looking for is a 20-40 pip bounce. Then we can micro manage the trade and reassess the situation technically and fundamentally.

As I stated in this post, we can't predict what some large oil producers like Russia/OPEC members might say. Oil spikes about 70 cents on this news giving life to CAD across the board. The structure for my NZD/CAD set up is still valid but may break down. I generally stay away from CAD pairs just for this reason.

Just thought I'd mention this in case anyone else is experiencing computer lag due to have many charts up at once all with the WW indicator on them.  
  
I have a fairly new computer but still experience lag and freezing and I'm using the 8.5 version. So after I go through my analysis for a particular pair, I just put the 2 triangles on the chart manually. Basically, I just use the WW that is already there from the indicator and superimpose two triangles onto the chart using the triangle drawing tool. Then I just delete the indicator from that chart. Whats left is all of the other filters and the two WW triangles. Now I can move onto another pair and not have to worry about any lag.

Expo33,  
  
Here goes mine. I don't know whether is perfect or not, but I traded it.  
Bought around 1.58600 and sold around 1.59237.  
Now waiting for your reply. Trade was with a demo account.

Looking for 600+ pips from this one.  
Fairly sure the current rally is a correction wave ii

Hi piptakers. Thank for posting.  
  
It looks like point C has really run north since you posted this but the wave is still valid (just barely still converging)  
  
Good luck!

I can't post a good chart as I'm away from my computer but make note that there is a bearish WW on the hourly that is now in the D leg. AB=CD completion is at 114.02

Hi pipstroll. Thanks for posting. Love the PVSRA template!  
  
Yes, you have posted a valid Wolfe wave. You said NZD/USD but I'm assuming you meant EUR/NZD.  
  
Just a side note. Always be mindful of any bigger waves in play

Looks like it was invalidated, on 30m/15m we have one almost formed in opposite direction.

In this case, I think it's better to wait for price stalling or some sign of rejection since price is accelerating (strength) into the sweet zone

If you have read through the thread and kept up with the ideas discussed, you would know that AB=CD isn't a necessary requirement for entry. It has been mentioned several times.  
  
For the trade you are asking about, I did an entire post specifically dedicated to answering the question: Why did I enter this trade before AB=CD?  
  
Please read post #1284

Parviz' indi is picking up bullish WWs in the D leg on the hourly, 4H, and weekly! None of which have very nice structure.

Interesting scenario with crude oil  
  
Completion of a Quasimodo pattern at point C of a beautifully clean structured WW on the Daily. Can oil fall $10 to complete this WW? I wouldn't think so. Have a look.

The indicator couldn't pick this one up because leg CD was too choppy. I found this one manually. A textbook case of confluence.  
  
1) AB=CD = .7333 almost to the pip on a daily chart!  
2) XA 161FIB extension = .7333  
3) BC 200FIB extesion = .7333  
4) Gann fan 4x1 line intersects time and space at .7333  
5) Bullish Quasimodo pattern completion at .7310  
  
For a daily time frame, could it be a bunch of coincidences? Or could it be the market is truly harmonic in nature?

Three levels of FIB confluence, Gann fan, previous S/R. Seems like a good spot for a bounce. Raises the question that's been posed before: Is point "X" legitimate?

Stopped out for -20 pips.  
  
Lesson reaffirmed: Don't force point "X", make sure it's a more distinct high or low.

Hi Kurt  
  
Thanks for setting up the thread and keeping it lively. Good job. Hoping to contribute more often in the future, but still in learning mode. One question regarding the (failed) EURJPY setup. Price touched the AC-Line a third time before it finally hit the trend line and sweet zone. Wasn't the setup already doubtful (invalid?) because of this? Thanks.  
  
EDIT: Attached the chart in another timeframe. But question remains the same.

If you change the scale down, it is a valid X point.  
From the examples I've seen, Bill Wolfe would have no problems to consider that a valid one.

Yea I noticed he has no problem basically putting X anywhere.  
  
For me, I prefer my starting point to be at a point where price is already moving in that direction, separate and distinct. I like the subjectivity in trading WWs, just as long as the plan is consistent

Agree, having the X point in same direction takes also advantage of crowd psychology:

Hey Expo,  
I'm no expert in Quasimodo patterns and I hadn't even heard of them until your post on Sunday evening. Please correct me if I'm wrong but I'm not sure that I can see that it has been correctly implemented in your diagram. As I understand it, there has to be a new extreme in price as the first point in the pattern and I don't think the small bull-leg really qualifies as a bull trend or a new extreme in price (?)

Thank you Stuart. You are correct!  
  
I learrned something new today. I always wondered if I was missing something. Interesting that no one on the "up and under" thread ever corrected me.  
  
The good news is, I think I just discovered a new pattern. We''ll call it the "rationalized, modified, no extreme high Expo33 Quasimodo" pattern.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60e.png?v=15.1)

Hi siawling.  
  
Looks like you got an initial surge in price. I hope you moved your stops to break even before oil price surge blew up all CAD pairs.

I'm glad you got some green pips.  
  
I'm always hesitant to have any open trades involving the Canadian dollar before the US inventory numbers come out. It doesn't really matter what system you're trading if oil surges $1 in price in 5 minutes, it's going to be bye bye all CAD bears the second the inventory print hits the wires

Please correct me if I'm wrong but I'm not sure that I can see that it has been correctly implemented in your diagram. As I understand it, there has to be a new extreme in price as the first point in the pattern and I don't think the small bull-leg really qualifies as a bull trend or a new extreme in price (?)

A little off topic, but I think this one fits the definition. A localized extreme low was made.

Entry price modification.  
  
As the D leg takes more and more time to reach the completion price, it loses it's symmetry. On the other hand it may be accumulating a little bit. Maybe gathering a little extra momentum. As such, I have adjusted the scale in zone to a higher price, a zone that also fits better into the Gann fan structure. Remember, the Gann fan also models "time" and in this case the D leg is taking more "time" so I'm trying to keep the symmetry with time by adjusting the scale in zone. This may not make much sense. Still a work in progress.....

Hi... Kurt  
I'm agree with you, USDJPY daily chart has 3 potential :1. QUASIMODO, 2. HEAD & SHOULDER pattern, and 3. AB=CD pattern.  
I've long it with stop if price break the red line to invalidate the structure.

I've noticed you're trading the patterns before they complete. I hope you will make green pips that way but I prefer to trade when the patterns are complete

UJ sells off pips so trade is into the scrap heap. Turns out my original zone would have filled 3 out of the 5 positions for nice 30+ pip gain.

USDJPY is heading back to its fresh lows between 108/109...  
EURUSD dare i say is becoming a new haven like GOLD and we could possibly see this head towards 1.13 and 1.15 in extension before seeing a minor 38.2% correction just in order for it to continue to go up... too many retail are short this pair and playing it short thinking GAP will close.. this is not always the case, we can have a runaway gap, i am cautious this pair and prefer the play on JPY crosses and GOLD.... so basically buy into safe havens... just my 2 cents.  
  
GOLD leads the way, and the way i see it there is no reason why GOLD cannot continue north, next targets are: 1264/1279 and possibly retest of 1300  
  
GBPJPY hit my TP targets... and those who recall my post i did mention that after targets were reached it could be a very strong short selling opportunity taking us back from where we came from prior the snap election date that PM May mentioned. 

Cheers!!PM23

Also not a WW. The structure becomes invalid once price forms a lower low after point C was established  
  
I respectfully suggest you go back to post#1 and learn from the start what constitutes a classic Wolfe wave.

there's one but the C point should be the lower one, again the X point falls under the weird ones, but technically according to B.Wolfe this still qualifies as a WW I think.

You got it, hence the need to be able to draw WWs manually as the indicator can't pick this one up regardless of the settings.   
  
Again, the sweet zone reigns supreme as price reverses beautifully.

Yeah, the concept of the sweet zone is the masterpiece of Bill Wolfe IMHO, it combines time and space, allowing zero drawdown entries on narrow zones. He suggests beginners to trade those narrow ones, as those are much easier to handle from the risk perspective. Steep zones require other filters like harmonic completions (AB=CD), fib extensions, market structure, etc... since price can go quite a bit before snapping back to equilibrium.  
  
Some thoughts about what makes up the sweet zone and the difference between AB=CD trading and WW trading.  
Why is the sweet zone much more powerful in timing entries?

Thanks for taking tome to put this analysis together.  
  
I also noticed that section in the PDF, something to be on the look out for.  
  
I think this video is relevant to the discussion. It comes from Damian ("Mr. Pip") who I really respect as a harmonic trader. I think this was the first video he did. He has an excellent thread: **"Ratios & Harmonics: a Different Way to Trade"**

Can't comment as I've never used it. Have you tried any of parviz' WW indicators that are on post #1?. I think you may find that they are more than sufficient and go far beyond anything else produced.

Well it's not "my" indicator it was developed by member "parviz".  
  
The newest versions do use a lot of the CPU. I use the 8.5 version. If I have a few charts up with the indicator on each, my platform also lags and freezes. What I do is put the indi on one chart, find any potential waves that I want to track, then delete the indi and put up the wave manually. Then I move on to the next pair. That way I keep my platform running normal.

I've been watching this one for a month and it's finally reached my scale in zone. Hopefully price will drift lower and fill up some of my positions. I have 40 micro lots ready with 2 pips between each position.  
  
Gann believed the fans carried more relevance on higher time frames, the weekly being particularly powerful. Judging from that fact, I would think there should be some strong resistance at the bottom of the scale in zone should price make it that far. Probably not a coincidence that the 38.2FIB from the larger move is right in that area.  
  
I think this set up potentially offers a nice RR. It will require some patience to be sure, but hopefully over the next few months the fundamentals and the carry trade factor will ultimately get the Kiwi heading back up again.

And here's what it looks like with the limit orders all set up. Just set them all at 100 pip SL with 300 pip TP. Will adjust TPs if orders get filled. Looks outrageous 2 pips apart on a weekly chart!  
  
By the way the scaling script I started using has been such a blessing. Saves a lot of time and is easy to use.

Hi Golden.  
  
There is no "correct" extdepth setting. The latest versions of the indicator (9.6 and 9.6.1) both automatically search all time frames and all extdepth settings. When it's done with the search, it will show clickable "buttons" that reveal the waves it has found. You can then click on the button to see the wave it has detected.  
  
The older version 8.5 does not automatically search for Wolfe waves. The user has to select the time frame and the extdepth setting manually.  
  
Many waves that have extremely choppy price action can not be detected by the indicator regardless of what the extdepth setting is on. Thus, it is beneficial to be able to detect and plot on Wolfe waves manually.  
  
Just in case you haven't seen it, on post #1 the developer of the indicator, "parviz1953" has attached instructions for each of the 3 versions I mentioned above. Hopefully, he will correct me if I've made any mistakes explaining how the indicators work.  
  
If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask. In the meantime, best of luck to you and thanks for posting.  
  
Hope this helps.  
  
Cheers, -Kurt

When it's done with the search, it will show clickable "buttons" that reveal the waves it has found. You can then click on the button to see the wave it has detected. The older version 8.5 does not automatically search for Wolfe waves. The user has to select the time frame and the extdepth setting manually. Many waves that have extremely choppy price action can not be...

Wow thank you so much for the detailed explination i started using ww and took a break from trading for about a month and i am just starting to research it again! This is probably the "holy grail" i have been looking for. It seems to be a simple system to understand and use when used properly. I have downloaded the pdf and will be following up of the forum! Thank you!

You're welcome.   
  
Well, far from the holy grail. Just a simple wave structure that we are trying to master. Finding the waves, or using the indicator to find them for you is the easy part. The hard part is coming up with a personalized filtering strategy to only trade those waves that give you an edge.

Please correct me if I am wrong but this WW is not invalidated passing out of the channel  
  
The other one I posted is a valid WW I believe. Correct me if I am wrong here too.

If you check his posts you will more than likely be very confused as half of the waves posted aren't Wolfe waves. In addition, most posts do not clearly show any of the points XABCD. I've stopped looking at them as I expect posters to at least make an effort to clearly define the wave they are suggesting.

The NZD/USD was a valid WW. The question is how big of a stop loss is one willing to risk given the position size, The bigger question is why one would be inclined to trade this wave in the first place. In hindsight, everything is easy.  
  
For this wave, what we can say before it reached point"D" was that the price action between A,B and C was a mess. Very choppy, with a couple of big wicks. Not good symmetry. Ideally we are looking for nice clean legs to our wave. Very distinct and uniform.  
  
As an example, look at the price action on this developing WW. Fairly uniform from A to B, from B to C, and now on the way down to D. (although price seems to have stalled for a few days. A much cleaner wave  
  
**CAD/CHF DAILY WW**

ahhh I see how it was valid and I defiantly agree the price action was very choppy and waves were not clearly defined. If I am correct this position would have been a sell once it hit the sweet spot but it continued up and would have probably hit stop loss

Actually, the real difference between us is the way of entry.  
  
You: put limited orders on support area.  
  
Me: find 2 possible entries with fibo extension.

If you actually took the time to read my posts you'd see that I ALWAYS use FIB extensions as an entry tool AND as a gauge of where to put my stop losses. Gann fans, previous S/R, larger move FIB retracements, and other tools are used to confirm the trade thru confluence.

Not sure why 9.6 doesn't draw the correct "D" point. If you calculate it manually, D should be at about 1.1288 as it is shown by the 8.5 version. Maybe the triangle is only drawn to the most up to date price on the 9.6 version whereas in the 8.5 version the triangle is drawn to where the AB=CD completion price should be, regardless if it ever reaches that price.  
  
Maybe Parviz can comment when he sees this post.  
  
**EDIT:** It looks like that's how the 9.6 version works. It only draws the D leg triangle up to the point where price reverses, NOT where the actual AB=CD price would be

Hi :  
Both version will draw the completed CWW and accept it as a valid complete , as soon as price reach the line1_3, and update every time you search again if price goes higher, if the price pass the 2nd sweet zone then, it does not draw it anymore( or show it as a potential) , and consider it a failed "complete" one.  
PS:  
So for a completed CWW, it does not wait for AB=CD ,and consider it valid by touch of Line1_3.  
In contrast to "potential", which it calculate, and predict the D, on the basis of AB=CD.  
The difference between U2 graph and yours , is that you used potential wave button and he chose the completed wave.

I'm still holding short from my hourly WW. SL to BE. Too bad only 1 of my 5 positions got filled. I see that on the daily it may be the start of a D leg down but way too early to tell.

Based on daily chart, I'm looking best price to short Aussie, I expect a D leg down to retest a support around 0,71XX.  
By the way, this is a QUASIMONDO PATTERN too.

We got most of the positions filled and the bounce in price. Stops moved up pretty tight, now to let this run.

AUDUSD D1  
  
I was thinking more along the lines of the chart below, being a bit more open minded as to how the waves are perceived.

Yes I agree. I knew I was trading against the bigger time frame wave. I posted this same wave on post#1326 and ended up banking about 120 pips. Longer term fundamentals kept me from holding it any longer than a week. As a general rule, the bigger time frame takes precedence but that won't stop me from entering a trade in the opposite direction on a smaller time frame if a valid WW presents itself. In fact, WWs inside bigger waves are good indicators that it's time to take some profit off the table. Truly, the possibilities are only limited by each trader's imagination.  
  
The hourly WW short on the Aussie netted me 50 pips in less than a day. Precisely, why I love WWs. Don't need a trend, don't need a particular pair, don't need a specific time frame. It's just one big smorgasbord of opportunities.  
  
Cheers, -Kurt

Stops moved to BE. Hopefully the Kiwi will keep running north. A nice little pullback into a demand zone, then the continuation up. So far a textbook trade.

Been waiting about 10 hours on this one. We are at the cusp of the scale in zone. Hopefully we can get some positions filled

Hi Kurt,  
I was looking at the front page trying to find the stop exit part of the plan. Maybe you have discussed it elsewhere in the thread, but would you mind outlining how you define your stop when using this strategy?  
Many thanks,  
Stuart

We only got 4 out of 10 positions filled but we took profit of 50+ pips per position. Price hit the target line to the pip

Hi Stuart.  
  
Placing the SLs is going to be somewhat subjective. A lot will depend on your risk management profile. For me, I tend to use the FIB extension of BC as a guideline. So, if I'm planning on scaling in from the 161FIB to the 200FIB, then my SLs will be above/below the next level which would be the 261FIB. I also look at the XA FIB extension to see if there is any confluence. I also look at the FIB levels from the bigger move to see if there is any confluence. In addition, I also look at previous S/R and Gann fans. I'm trying to use multiple tools to find a layer of confluential resistance. Where is a level that will be the line in the sand? Then place my SLs above/below that level. The idea is to give the trade enough room to breath while managing the risk in a way that makes sense.  
  
Here's an example form my active Kiwi trade. I took the trade levels and indicator off the chart so it's easier to see how I initially set my SLs. Hopefully, it's self explanatory. In this case the SL is roughly 30 pips from the top of the scale in zone which may seem like a lot for a 30MIN WW, but my ultimate TP zone is from 50-100 pips. As long as the total %risk for the trade is within my own personal risk management parameters, then I can sleep well at night.  
  
It may sound silly to some, but for me, the whole process is almost an art form. From locating/mapping the wave, to constructing a confluence profile, to setting the SLs and TPs. It's all a personal journey. We all have the same canvas but we have the freedom to paint our own masterpiece (wow, that is some cheesy stuff right there!)

Updated look with trade levels and SLs moved to BE. Notice the 23.6FIB from the larger move is now my support area. The SLs at BE are just below that level. Now it's a stress free trade, just sit back and see if we hot a home run. I actually did bank some pips from one position. There were 7 scaled in from the start with 6 left running.

Just to take the discussion a little further, there is now a new bearish WW developing. This may give us a new guideline for adjusting a few of our TPs. Have a look here:

Thanks for the reply. I thought it would be a subjective matter or else it would, no doubt, have been specified from the outset, but I thought I'd check.

Thanks for the clarification Kurt. Like you say it's a subjective matter and I would probably do something similar using the S/R zones to the left and some function of ATR (depending on timeframe) rather than extension percentages. If there's a number of S/R targets in close proximity, I've noticed that the middle of the zone can work well if not scaling in. Then it is just a matter of determining where the next S/R zone is and whether it is worth toughing it out and letting price head towards it whilst on board, or stopping out and maybe trying again in the next zone.   
  
All the best,  
Stuart

Found this one manually as the indicator couldn't pick it up. Missed the first scale in position by one pip. Guess I should have started scaling in at the 141FIB with 10 smaller positions instead of 5. Was trying to mitigate risk as this pair can be volatile. Would have been nice to have 30 pips green and another free roll. Such is life, move forward and look for the next opportunity.

This version is a great help for picking up right charts, but it frezzed the screen some times...

hi bro,  
  
Is there any way to speed up the searching process? press search again will lead to Mt4 crash sometimes...  
  
maybe you can limit the searching criteria？ or make it adjustable?  
  
For E.X, my favorite para for ZZ is 12 20, so the program will only search 12,20.  
  
I hope this could speed up the program and eliminate crashes.  
  
As you know, if crash happens, it will be a big trouble for EA users...  
  
Thanks for your great effort!

Hi :  
1) It would be much faster if you do not press "search again" button , instead change the TF and return , this will stop indicator and reinitialize , and so it is much faster.  
2)The lower the TF the higher the amount of bars and data, so the slower the indicator.  
3) I have implemented your idea : in this version you are not limited to a set of 6 ExtDepth anymore , you may now enter whatever you want (eg. 12,20 or 12,6,30,20) in the input. (only need to be comma separated, does not even need to be in order).  
  
This will replace version 9.6 .

Thanks  
Feel free to enter other depths too, like (5, 23, 18....)  
but it is very interesting that 3,6,12 and probably 24,36 ...., are harmonics frequencies, so that if in lower TF , you find a pattern with say 20 , you will find the same pattern in higher TF with Depth of 3 or 6,... .

Just become a valid Completed CWW ,it will enter the Sweet Zone, if it continue to go higher, better to look for confluence point , before trading short, to get a better risk to reward ratio.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Hi sister.  
  
If you draw the lines as they should be, this is technically not a WW as XB and AC are not converging.

This WW was discussed in detail over the last 2 weeks. Price was obviously a bit over extended but bullish momentum kept us in the monitoring mode. I was on the sidelines until finally pulling the trigger yesterday, and I'm glad I did as it's now nearly +100 pips in the green. All SLs to BE with TPs open for adjustment. Probably may take half profit off before the weekend. This may have legs to run down some more.  
  
Confluence was just too good to resist.  
  
1) Price continually rejected off the top of the Gann fan  
2) 261FIB of BC extension  
3) 200FIB of the XA extension  
4) 78.6 FIB of the larger move  
  
Also, not shown is bearish daily divergence on the MACD.

You're welcome, hope you didn't lose too much, good that you had your SLs in place.  
  
As I stated at the start of the week, I was going to be on the sidelines for all pairs involving the Canadian dollar due to the uncertainty surrounding the OPEC meetings that went on all day today. Unfortunately, it doesn't really matter what system you're trading. When oil plummets, UCAD is going to the moon, at least in the short term.

Hi Rees.  
  
Thank you for the kind words. I consider myself a student before an expert. I'm glad you're learning something here. I'm also learning here. This thread has challenged me, and opened my eyes to some new ways of thinking and trading. It's exactly what I was hoping it would be.  
  
Cheers, -Kurt

Nice set-up.  
  
You can see the obvious demand zone as point D approaches. Well worth monitoring  
  
**NOTE:** There is also another valid WW on the 4H. Worth keeping an eye on. I am tentative when it comes to anything with CAD involved until oil price settles back into a less volatile mode. At the moment, oil is rebounding, thus GBP/CAD going down  
  
**Another GBP/CAD 4H CWW at completion**

I am tentative when it comes to anything with CAD involved until oil price settles back into a less volatile mode. At the moment, oil is rebounding, thus GBP/CAD going down Another GBP/CAD 4H CWW at completion {image}

> USDJPY is heading back to its fresh lows between 108/109... EURUSD dare i say is becoming a new haven like GOLD and we could possibly see this head towards 1.13 and 1.15 in extension before seeing a minor 38.2% correction just in order for it to continue to go up... too many retail are short this pair and playing it short thinking GAP will close.. this is not always the case, we can have a runaway gap, i am cautious this pair and prefer the play on JPY crosses and GOLD.... so basically buy into safe havens... just my 2 cents. GOLD leads the way,...

Hope some of you caught this move on GOLD or JPY crosses...

Looks like first level has broken. I'm liking the looks of the WW you posted. It's right at the 50FIB from the larger move and also right at the 4x1 Gann fan line. I've got 20 scaled in micro limit orders ready. TPs to be adjusted if positions get filled. Maybe today, or maybe next week it will happen.

EURGBP  
  
Just gone short at 8745.2  
Looking at the daily chart we can see 2 measured moves just completed. The red lines on the right show the MM based on the BC leg and the one on the left shows a logical buy above a bull signal bar with the logical price action stop at the low of the preceding strong leg.

Good luck to us.  
  
My entire zone got filled up from .8722-8742. So far the soldiers have defended their ground. I thought about booking the little profit as it has been an amazing week, but instead I'll keep this open into next week

The only other trade I'm holding over the weekend. This has filled up and held it's ground. I think this is encouraging considering oil rebounded about $1.70 in the last 7 hours

GBPJPY daily may be setting up something quite appealing.  
  
The bull move I am looking at will hopefully meet support in the circled area on the left. The 14212 Breakout above a prior swing high has already been tested and there were buyers there. I'm hoping there is a little more left in the bear move so that the BC measured move completes down to the 14131 area. This is also a decent support area and the worst case from the point of view of a stop would be the 14000 level, but lower timeframe price action and measured moves may give a better idea if and when the time comes. Also a >50% retracement of the prior bull move would take us to a level below 14186 which then becomes more attractive for bulls. This is also a decent support area and the worst case from the point of view of a stop would be the 14000 level, but lower timeframe price action and measured moves may give a better idea if and when the time comes.

And with Gann Fan on (I don't know how to use this properly as Kurt does (more reading to do on my part) but I think this works. Kurt will have to correct me if I'm wrong, but I think the Fan implies that one could expect to meet support around the 14100 area as things stand just now (?)

The weekly chart shows a strong Bull breakout in the shaded area and this should give rise to some sort of measured move and there are numerous possibilities based on buy-the-close bulls with a stop below the low of the bull trend or possibly the open of the week 45 breakout bar to the close of week 48 strong bull bar - who knows just now?! Maybe there'll be one or more legs down from here (to maybe form a 3-push bull flag on the line shown) before the resumption of the bull move, if it does indeed resume. The 14000 area on the weekly chart is showing decent support as the signal bar high (ie where the bulls entered before) is shown.

I am very surprised that Parviz Indi has not be turned into an EA. I feel it would be interesting to see.

> GBPJPY daily may be setting up something quite appealing. The bull move I am looking at will hopefully meet support in the circled area on the left. The 14212 Breakout above a prior swing high has already been tested and there were buyers there. I'm hoping there is a little more left in the bear move so that the BC measured move completes down to the 14131 area. This is also a decent support area and the worst case from the point of view of a stop would be the 14000 level, but lower timeframe price action and measured moves may give a better idea...

Hi Sal.  
  
I like the analysis and yes, your Gann fan looks right to me.  
  
This setup brings up the discussion we had before in regards to where is a valid starting point for "X". I think it's a personal preference for each trader. If it works, that's all that really matters. For me, I like to have my starting point be at least a distinctive minor high or low.  
  
Just a side note. I only use the New York close for candles (damn self centered Yanks!). I noticed your candles are noticeably different than mine. I'm curious what broker/platform you are using?  
  
Notice the difference right where the unfilled gap is

I'm not sure it would be that simple. Personally I'm not a huge of EAs to begin with. That's not to say they don't have value or don't work. I just like to set everything up manually.  
  
Sure, you could make an EA that just enters a trade as soon as the AB=CD price hits within a valid WW, but how would you account for any type of confluence. For every valid WW there are more reasons to NOT trade it than there are TO trade it.  
  
Maybe others will chime in with there thoughts on this

Hey Kurt,  
I use IG index and their free access to ProRealTime charts. That is why I struggled to take a look at Parviz' indicator so had to set up a demo account just to check it out.  
With respect to the chart timeframes, I dislike the differences. As I trade FTSE price action on lower timeframes I really like the 8am open and the 16:30 close because it gives the day a certain structure. The globex session drives me nuts as some of the daily price action is affected by the globex session, whereas channels and patterns often carry though from the close of the prior day to the open of 'today' and you don't see that if you have the globex chart up so it is generally more work than it should be to rationalise the price action. I have come to the conclusion that it shouldn't matter because whichever chart is being traded needs to make sense so if a daily session channel line is providing support, there is always another reason that should be apparent on the globex chart. Ok, so I've gone off on one a bit there - sorry! The message I guess is that it shouldn't matter. Gaps are just spikes, climaxes, trend bars. I just mentally fill in the gaps with a trend bar. I could probably elaborate on that at some point if you wanted me to.  
Yes, I've seen the discussion about what constitutes a valid start point or point X and can see that it is in the eye of the beholder and neither way is right or wrong. If it works for 'you' then it is right for you. I wasn't actually looking for Wolfe Waves when I saw this GBPJPY possibility; I was looking through some HTF charts trying to identify potential setups for a different strategy and then I noticed this WW setup so maybe it doesn't look as appealing to a WW trader, but from a PA perspective there's the potential to structure some nice trades.  
Cheers  
Stuart

Hello expo and hello to all other users :-) I am really happy to have found this strategy and you guys. I have already spent many hours exploring WWs and it is huge fun. But I wanted to ask if someone can take the time and explain me the fibo lines! So where do I put them in and how do I interpret them?

Hi there and welcome to Expo's quality WW thread!  
  
It has been said that people don't trade the markets; they trade their beliefs about the markets. So first you have to ask yourself if you believe that Fib numbers have any use in the markets. If you do then you can probably trade them, but ask yourself why do you believe in them. I know that Expo, or Kurt, among many others believe in these % extensions (that for some reason get labeled as Fibos but I'm not sure what the numbers actually have to do with Fibonacci sequence!- if they do then can someone please enlighten me) and from what I have seen they are useful to them and can help traders who believe in them to attach a structure to their trading set ups with respect to how they scale in to trades or where they place their stops. This is a powerful thing, as a strategy and set up you believe in and can trade without question is worth its weight in gold. I am probably in the minority of traders who don't find 'Fib' numbers useful in their trading because they don't have any statistical significance and are as good as / no better than any other numbers you may care to conjur up. That is my belief and you may not find it useful. I believe that looking for support and resistance levels and zones to the left on the chart and trying to find areas of confluence with forms of leg 1 =leg 2 (measured) moves - these are areas of self-fulfilling prophecies that generate their own support / resistance because bulls will go long / buy back their shorts and at the same time bears will go short / sell out of their longs - in the recent past gives the best chance of success and I use these areas to structure my trades.  
  
I do not mean to antagonise anyone and I make no judgement on what other people believe. There are many ways to trade in general and certainly many ways to trade Wolfe Waves. 'Fibos' may provide you with the answer, but if they don't then it is certainly possible trade without them.  
  
Cheers,  
Stuart

Nice post Sal. It's always productive and educational to here some views from the other side of the coin sort of speak. By the way, I thought your charts looked familiar. I had recently downloaded the trial platform to check out their renko options.  
  
The extensions come from the true retracement levels that are derived from the actual fibonacci number sequence.  
  
Here's a copy and past from this pdf: <http://www.forex.com/uk/pdf/Fibonacci-guide.pdf>  
  
Maybe of some interest to others, just thought I'd post it here.

If you use the legitimate retracement levels derived form the # sequence: .236, .382, .618. and you come up with the default meta4 extension levels.  
  
1/.236 = 4.23  
1/.382 = 2.61  
1/.618 = 1.61  
  
The rest are derived from the added levels thru squaring , etc etc. There are entire books written on the subject but not really something we need to get into for our purposes.  
  
Anyways, more importantly, as you stated, we need to be looking left to see the previous S/R. My love affair with fibos/extensions comes when multiple levels match up with those previous S/R levels.  
.  
I believe that human behavior is at the root of price action. How and why that behavior is shaped could come from a myriad of reasons from technicals, to fundamentals, to order flow, to insider trading, to HFTs, to reasons beyond the scope of our knowledge. For me, if Fibo spirals can exactly model physical nature, then it's my belief that Fibo levels can model traders behavior (to some extent). Anyways, probably beyond the scope of this thread, just rambling on. I suppose there are Fibomaniacs and then there are anti-Fibites, lol.  
  
I'll try to give an example here in a little while when I get a moment.

**PREVIOUS S/R with FIBONACCI retracement/extension analysis**  
  
Sorry if the chart is a little busy with 4 different fibos but I wanted to show the whole picture. If even one trader finds this post useful, then it's worth posting.

**  
  
Lets try and break it down. Others may see it differently, and that's a good thing. This is how I see it. Note, the AB=CD is basically about 80.60  
  
_**THE THOUGHT PROCESS**_  
  
1) If price actually continues higher on the D leg, then based on previous S/R and the psychological round number theory, 80.00 should be a big hurdle as far as resistance goes. But let's assume for the moment that price **does** indeed break through that psychological 80 level, now what?  
  
2) The 61.8 FIB retracement level is basically within 10 pips of the AB=CD price. Remember, we are talking about a structure that spans over 400 pips and a retracement that started 4 months ago.  
  
3) The 141.4FIB extension of MH (major high) is within a few pips of AB=CD  
  
4) The 200FIB extension of XA is 13 pips from AB=CD  
  
5) The 361FIB extension of BC is 17 pips from AB=CD  
  
Ok so what, a bunch of meaningless FIB retrace/extension levels just happen to be in the area of AB=CD. well, not so fast lets look a bit deeper.  
  
6) **The acceleration zone** \- looking left you really don't see any previous important S/R in this zone. So, in my opinion, if price does indeed break through the 80 barrier, then there may be one last impulse wave as price gets into the acceleration zone.  
  
Here's the kicker. When you look back to the right from the acceleration zone you see basically nothing in the way of FIB levels. Interesting to say the least considering we are talking about a 50 pip zone. Instead, all of the most recent and most pertinent FIB levels are all piling up right around that AB=CD level. Coincidence?  
  
7) And finally, it is pretty clear where the major supply level is at (major resistance)  
  
**So the only question is where to enter into this trade if it so happens that price does penetrate into what I am calling the "acceleration zone".**  
  
For me, there is no need to get to cute here. I'm not trying to pick tops/bottoms. I'm trying to pick zones that have a high probably of a price reversal. From the chart, you can see the scale in zone. I will likely use my scaling in script to set up about 10 small positions about 3-4 pips apart. Maybe even 20 smaller positions 2 pips apart.  
  
Sorry if this seemed like an endless rant. Hope it helps someone in some small way. I know it helps me.  
  
Cheers to a great week ahead -Kurt

The only two trades I held thru the weekend. Be nice London, daddy needs a new pair of shoes. I think they both highlight the scaling in option that I prefer. We don't need perfection, we only need preparation and patience.  
  
Both doing well with plenty of scaled in positions giving the option to micro manage

Hey Kurt,  
Thanks for the enlightenment! I've learnt why they are called Fib ratios and it's still early on a (bank holiday) Monday morning. May the learning continue through the week ahead.   
It's an interesting discussion regarding Fibs and I guess there's no right or wrong answer. Like you, I believe that human behavior is at the root of price action and will be until we evolve into a different species. I understand Fib spirals modelling physical nature, but I do not see how Fib spirals model, or have any bearing on, human behavior. Each to their own and if a trader's beliefs help him/her to trade the market then that has to be a good thing. Confidence in the market is a necessity and if Fib levels can, somehow, instill confidence in some traders then they have a powerful tool.  
  
Here's to a great week!  
Stuart

I understand Fib spirals modelling physical nature, but I do not see how Fib spirals model, or have any bearing on, human behavior. Each...

Hi Mich.  
  
I'm not sure what your planning on trading but as of this moment, there's a bearish WW forming. However, if price falls further the structure won't be valid as it will lose it's convergence.

I'm still long on fundamentals here. There is also a bullish WW on the weekly for this pair I but couldn't resist a good 20 pip scalp on this nicely formed bearish WW. In and out for 20 pips. The AB and CD legs were very crisp with decent symmetry. Also, the 161FIB extension is commonly a profit taking zone for bulls, a no brainer trade here.  
  
Like I always say, we aren't trying to predict some major shift in sentiment, or predict where prices will be 5 waves down the road. We're just trying to capitalize on one simple corrective impulse wave. If you can harvest 20-40 pips a day, you'll be financially free in a few years

Oh yeah, i analysed the chart wrong! In order to understand it better, I sketched the two scenarios. Maybe the illustration helps other members too.

The only difference between a classic WW and a horizontal WW is that line XB is horizontal, or very close to it.

Im looking at this wave. its a little sloppy, not really sure about where the X setup is. ideally it should be at previous low below last swing high.  
put a gann line on it and prior support , Well see !!

Forgot to post this one when it was live. Small time frame but couldn't resist such perfect AB=CD symmetry, both time and price. Picked up an easy 30 pips. No need to target steep target lines.

Hi Tbuild.  
  
I was away from my PC when you posted this so I couldn't get a really good look at the chart. A couple pf things.  
  
1) Just be aware that there is a bearish WW in play on the daily. Not that you can't trade against that and make some pips. Just always good to know when there's a higher TF WW in play.  
  
2) Also, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and there isn't a right or wrong way. However, for this setup, I don't like that there is a price print that is lower than point X before point A is printed.  
  
This is the way I would see the wave. No confluence with the Gann fan (not shown) and no confluence with the BC extension, but there's perfect confluence with the larger FIB retracement (the 38.2)  
  
The fact that the AB=CD is a round number, 111, implies that there would likely be some interest beforehand. And there was, right about the 261 extension. Of course this is in hindsight now but I thought I'd post my thoughts anyways.  
  
Good luck

Thanks Kurt for the detailed explanation. i was actually looking at that setup on 1 hr chart you showed , but i didnt think it was valid because of the higher A.  
Blue points are mine. But it wasnt the best set up to start with. thanks much for this tread !!

As I stated last week, I stayed away from any CAD pairs due to the OPEC meetings that took place on May 25th, which is basically right about the time that this structure was completing.   
  
In looking at the trade, the price bounced up over 50 pips from the AB=CD level. So that's what we are looking for. This is exactly why I would have moved my SLs to BE at that point. In addition, I tend to scale in multiple positions, so I would have had the option to bank a little profit as well. So even though price ultimately went back down, you can keep yourself protected by micro managing.

Ok thank you very much for such good information! Expo if you have nothing against it, I'd like to ask you a few personal questions. I have read in this threat, that you are a professional trader and trade approximately 80% of your trades with this strategy. Therefore (and because I have noticed it in my own trades) i think this is a very powerful strategy. How many Pips you catch round about in the month with this strategy? And how long do you practiced to become profitable?  
  
And to all the other users who have been involved with this strategy for a long time: How much pips do you manage per month?

Overall, I have been trading for about 10 years. I've dabbled in dozens of systems and blown many small accounts. I basically refused to take responsibility for my losses.  
  
About 15 months ago I started studying Wolfe waves. I spent about 6 months using a demo account to see what worked and what didn't. Learning the structure was the easy part, learning how to apply the theory was the hard part. Not because it's really complicated, but because we each have a personality profile when it comes to trading. In my opinion, the biggest hurdle to overcome in trading is yourself. Mainly your ego, your fears, and your greed. Like many I put my 10,000 hours of study in to be a successful trader, but that means nothing if you can't tame the beast that lies inside all of us.  
  
Anyways, I've been trading mainly WWs for about 9 months now. It's hard to quantify how many pips a month as I tend to scale in from 3-40 positions per trade depending on the time frame and pair. So the number of pips per month isn't really that relevant. What's relevant is consistently initiating high probability trades with sound risk management. I put up a trade explorer 14 days ago for a mini account and it shows nearly +10,000 pips, which doesn't really mean too much considering how many micro positions were scaled in. With my overall account size, I'm happy to harvest 20-50 pips a day. That's more than enough to live comfortably given my monthly financial obligations. As my overall account grows, it will become irrelevant. A few good trades a month can be very lucrative once the account grows to a certain level. For me, it was never about the money, it was always about the freedom. And honestly, I love the competition, the chase, the hunt, the win. I grew up in a hockey family, that's all we ever did. We lived it, we breathed it. Every day was a war on the ice, and only the ones with the commitment and mental fortitude survived. Trading is no different. It's a tough game but I find it rewarding in many ways other than just the financial rewards.  
  
Cheers, -Kurt

looks like this is what u r looking for...  
  
CWW is profitable and create EA is a piece of cake...but first, some problems as following:  
  
1 How to optimize entry area?  
*Put limited orders on and just wait for stopped out?  
*if CD> 110%AB, we do nothing but wait?  
*if CD>120%AB, no emergency exit or some back up plan?  
  
2 Should we leave or partially close at XC line?

if u leave at XC line you will miss 1000 pips...  
*let the profit run or take the profit? that's a hard decision...

No I didn't.   
  
The Swissy across the board showed strength today. In addition, oil prices tumbled once again. SO the best WW structure in the world was probably doomed. I'm always a bit concerned when I trade any pairs involving the CAD as the oil market is incredibly speculative and likely manipulated to some extent by the talking heads around the world.  
  
Hopefully you had a reasonable SL in place and just leave it behind and look for another opportunity.

Sorry i am totally lost. Very new here. I've read the 1st post but didn't find any information about it. Or perhaps i missed it(although i did read it twice). Could you point me the link to the previous post(about those numbers). Very much appreciated. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f602.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f602.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f602.png?v=15.1)  
Does it also tell about entering before of after completion? Thank you in advance.

Thanks for the setup Parviz.  
  
I just got in and was lucky to be able to scale in from 1.1230-1.1245  
  
A lot of bullish momentum to contend with but this seems like a good spot for a little correction  
  
Cheers, -Kurt

The only thing that i may suggest you is, to start from the first post and go on, or just read my posts during indicator development , or google the zigzag indicator....,or better even download it , try to change the ExtDepth in the input and see how it detect and draw the high's and low's of the price curve.

No not at all, read the expo posts regarding confluence and how to better scale in ,.... read all carefully , the Wolf wave theory pdf of the first page also is very helpful.

Thanks for all of the information you have both provided. I discovered this thread the other day and have been going through it all. I analyzed USDCAD the other day and was looking for Take Profit. You can see in the screenshot it was accurate but I'm wondering if it was a fluke or not. Any insight would be great because I'm new at it, thanks!

If you have read the thread , you know that there was a lot of controversies regarding the selection of X point, even in pdf of wolfe himself , but it has been agreed to comply with the expo preference (and of course many others.. ), that, a valid X point is better to be located between B and C points for a valid Classical WW. In your drawing ,X is way below B, and in contradiction to the rule C is above A, indeed you considered the body of the bar to fit the WW, if you take the wicks into account then you see that C is higher than A.

You have the structure backwards. This isn't a Wolfe Wave. You're trying to trade this as a bullish WW in which case price would be declining not increasing. Look at the diagram again on post #1

I have no idea what you're talking about or who you are talking to? What's MM? Why no time frame or pair on your charts?

The time frame and number of pips is irrelevant.  
  
If you risk 1% per trade then a losing trade costs you 1% of your account.  
  
Smaller time frame, smaller stop loss, bigger position  
Bigger time frame, bigger stop loss, smaller position  
  
Both scenarios will have the same predetermined risk of 1%

Probably would need a really bad NFP print to have a chance of getting down to the scale in zone. Some nice confluence down there and an unfilled gap as well.

Didn't trade this as I didn't see it beforehand. Probably wouldn't have traded it anyways as it's one ugly looking WW. However, reversal took place 6 pips above AB=CD and price reached the target line nearly to the pip. A cool 70 pips. Opportunities are everywhere for the astute and prepared trader.

I think there's a possibility that price could continue lower down to the second sweet zone. Going to be extra patient here and scale in with tiny positions all the way down to the 88.6FIB

Would you have originally marked this chart up as I have shown in red?  
  
If I have drawn it correctly, then I guess I'm also asking, can you have consecutive CWW's in the same direction?

Hi sister.  
  
I think we have to look at the bigger picture. Price has just reached the AB=CD completion level so the stop loss needs to be much lower to give the trade a chance to breathe. You shouldn't be getting stopped out at the AB=CD completion level.  
  
I tried to show in the chart. I would have been scaling in at the break of the first support down to the AB=CD level with stops below. Everyone has their own way of doing it but this is how I would be looking at it.  
  
Anyways, seems you are learning the structure well, keep practicing and good luck  
  
Cheers, -Kurt

The indicator picks this one up with "extdepth" setting at 20. I'll keep it on my radar.

It's been discussed in length as you go through the thread. You'll have to read through from the start. I just don't have time to keep posting the same stuff over and over. Really busy time of year for me. Sorry

Hi Kurt:  
I have just finished adding fib projection to the previous fib values.  
I thought it might be useful for those interested , so here it is, as a new version of 9.7....

Thanks Parviz.  
  
I'm away from home until later but I'll check it out then. I'm note sure exactly what you mean but I'll figure it out when I download it. Also, I have run out of the allowed number of attachments on post #1 so maybe I can reference this post as to where to find it.

Thanks :  
You may just replace it with version 9.6, they are exactly the same logically, except some add features of 9.7 and now the fib projection values.  
This feature is useful when for example in potential CWW you want to know how much more CD has projected beyond AB=CD.

actually, this chart will also raise a question...  
  
If new XABCD appears, should we use new XC line as TP?

Hello traders. Looking forward to an exciting week ahead. Should be many good opportunities.  
  
I have been fiddling around with the "zup" harmonic indicator over the weekend and will be adding it to my toolbox. I have seen the "zup" versions in the past but never really used them. For more experienced traders here, this might be of some use.  
  
Basically, I am just adding the indicator to my chart to see if any Wolfe waves correspond with the end point of a larger harmonic structure. (it's inevitable that some will). Another aspect is multi time frame analysis. For instance, the zup shows a bearish gartley on the daily and the there is a WW with the same ending point on a smaller time frame.  
  
Anyways, just thinking and and sharing out loud. I have been fiddling with the settings just for aesthetics and plan on delving more deeply into this indicator. The thread's focus is still on Wolfe waves, just adding another layer to the cake.  
  
I believe member "poruchik" is the resident expert on this indicator. He has added some very useful and relevant posts here already.  
  
Cheers all, green pips going forward, -Kurt  
  
Here's just one example. A bullish bat with basically the same end point as the Wolfe wave. Remember, we are generally talking about price "zones" not an exact price.  
  
I like this version:

This doesn't require anyone to do any more work. The zup indicator stands on its own and is just an addition to the chart.

This harmonic indi...is a reflection of the people's behavier.  
  
Every time the pattern was found and there was someone enter the market.  
  
Now i do believe market is a casino, everything is base on possibility but nothing.

Hi Kurt:  
I was not able to reproduce your finding with zup on AUDUSD 4H, do you use any special settings or it is the default one, and do you have any idea or documents about what these different setting means..??

I just got home and also can't reproduce the same chart. I haven't changed the settings, only the color so I really have no idea what's happening. Could be a repainting issue? Don't really know.  
  
If you search the forum here there are a lot of discussions about the many different zup versions but I haven't found any answers and will be away from my desktop until tomorrow.  
  
I'm sure "poruchik" would know the answer. Hopefully he will stop by at some point and enlighten us. In the meantime, I think I may put this addition to the plan on hold.

> USDJPY is heading back to its fresh lows between 108/109... EURUSD dare i say is becoming a new haven like GOLD and we could possibly see this head towards 1.13 and 1.15 in extension before seeing a minor 38.2% correction just in order for it to continue to go up... too many retail are short this pair and playing it short thinking GAP will close.. this is not always the case, we can have a runaway gap, i am cautious this pair and prefer the play on JPY crosses and GOLD.... so basically buy into safe havens... just my 2 cents. GOLD leads the way,...

Now these positions are in a great position where can set my trail stop and leave it be.... with current world tensions GOLD, GBPJPY and USDJPY have been some of the best pairs to be trading in with good solid movements.  
  
Green pips to all!!

Sorry to take so long to reply.  
If this count is correct, the minimum Wave c iii target would be 1298.96.

The UK election has thrown many pairs out of their natural harmonic rhythm. There are always opportunities but it may be time to remain patient and prudent heading into the weekend.   
  
I'm only holding my AUD/USD short at the moment. 30 pips or so green but really hoping for a break of .7525 area

Could you give your reasoning why it is sell.

Important to note that there's a larger WW in play here. A few weeks ago I posted and traded this bullish CWW on the weekly. Nearly a 300 pip move so not to get too greedy all positions have been closed. Maybe time for a little pullback.

We got 3 out of 5 positions filled up. Closed out all 3 for an average of 30 pips. Although this trade was against 3 very bullish weekly candles, it highlights the power of the simple WW structure.

H4x is drawing the Wolfe waves manually.  
  
Post #1 has member "parviz1953" three different WW indicators with instructions as to how they work.

I closed all of my AUD/USD shorts. It's been a very good week and I decided to take the profits from this trade. I don't want to be holding anything over the weekend.

Looks like CWW. When line XB is horizontal then you have a HWW.

Yes, Kurt is right, I am drawing them manually, where I am training my mind to be more familiar with WW.  
  
and I advise you as first step to draw them manually, after that you can use the indicator.

hi Ritter  
  
I can not see any WW on daily chart!![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)  
  
but in 4H you can see an old one  
  
you can go on the first post, and you will find a great PDF book " [Wolfe-Wave-book (1) (3).pdf](https://www.forexfactory.com/attachment.php/2212319?attachmentid=2212319&d=1488545905) "

Yes, I already notice that, it is working even against the main trend and it can show you the reversal point of the trend !  
I notice also it is working in 1Min and 5 Min TF with great % of Success!!  
  
But, I want to ask you about the taking profit point, are you usually waiting to hit the ETP points? since I notice it is just taking short time to hit 61.8%.  
  
What is your advice here ?

Hi Kurt,  
I also closed out my AUDUSD short trade.  
It looks more like a very shallow correction before higher.  
Cheers mate! 

Wait, or you will be slaughtered!

Agree mate.   
  
Not sure it will necessarily go higher but looks to be well supported down to 7470 in the short term. FED rate decision next week, just seemed prudent to bank the pips and sit on the sidelines for now. Still, a higher probability trade with low stress and decent results.  
  
Cheers

Refer to the diagram on post #1.  
  
For a bullish WW, after point X and A are established, you are looking for B as a lower low, then C as a lower high, then D as another lower low that breaks the trend line formed by XB.

Certainly a valid structure. Just beware of smaller time frames going into Friday as liquidity dries up.

A couple of points.  
  
1) I don't think this is a major reversal for NZD/CHF which is basically irrelevant anyways. I'm only looking for a short term price correction based on WW theory. In this case, based on the time frame and the actual structure, price may correct 30-50 pips.  
  
2) I don't set my TPs at the actual "target line" or try to correlate a TP with the "estimated time of arrival". I'm generally very conservative with my TPs, taking profits (or at least partial profits) before the actual target line. As was the case with my last NZD/CHF trade. No need to get greedy, especially heading into Friday. The ETA price was about 15-20 pips lower but I like to get out a bit early and stay away from the herd mentality. We don't need home run trades. They're nice but not really needed. With a 10k account, making 30 pips a day, trading only 1 lot per 10k of capital, and you'll be financially free in one year.

Well, they're ALL worth watching, but is it worth trading?  
  
Price goes where it wants to go, so the question is why might price reverse or correct other than just the simple fact that it has reached the WW sweet zone?  
  
Is there FIB confluence? Is there previous S/R? Bollinger band breaks? Pertinent Gann fan level? Divergence? Risk off sentiment? GDT results due out soon? Is there anything other than price entering the sweet zone that can potentially make this trade have a higher probability of success?  
  
Every trader has a different perspective and a different set of tools. It's our job as traders to utilize our personal toolbox coupled with our unique perspective to give us the "edge" needed to be successful in this business.

Hello Wolfe wavers. I hope everyone had a nice weekend. Back to business now. No open WW trades at the moment but lots of potential set ups on higher time frames for the week.

Hello,  
  
Yes it was. I think the combo has different rules for entry. usually, the sweet zone is around C...anyway. it's just a test.  
  
I have checked some trades from your strategy, it is really nice but i don't know when to scrap, when to trade normally.  
  
Are there any specific rules for trading styles?  
  
Thanks!

Here is a good example.  
  
**THE FIRST WW:** Leg CD has uniform price action down to the sweet zone D. As a result, there is very nice symmetry and would be a wave I would like to trade.  
  
**THE SECOND WW:** Leg CD has sideways price action. Price has not dropped below point C so technically this is still a valid WW. However, the wave structure is indecisive and any subsequent move to point D will exhibit very poor wave symmetry. As such, this set up would go into the scrap heap.  
  
Hope this example helps

When I first started studying WWs, that's exactly what I would do. Now, there's a group of indicator's developed by member "parviz 1953" that automatically search and detect CWWs. The different versions and instructions can be found on post #1  
  
However, there are no short cuts to being proficient at trading CWWs. Learning to spot and map out WWs manually is a necessary exercise if you want to truly be immersed in WW theory. I advise you to start at post #1 and read through the entire thread. There have been some excellent improvements made along the way and some very thoughtful and pertinent posts made by some very good traders.  
  
Good luck!

Going against a lot of short term momentum here. Wave is overextended. Price is trying to break through the 88.6FIB for a full retracement of the bigger move. This trade will be on s short lease, a 12 pip stop loss

> I've been watching this one for a month and it's finally reached my scale in zone. Hopefully price will drift lower and fill up some of my positions. I have 40 micro lots ready with 2 pips between each position. Gann believed the fans carried more relevance on higher time frames, the weekly being particularly powerful. Judging from that fact, I would think there should be some strong resistance at the bottom of the scale in zone should price make it that far. Probably not a coincidence that the 38.2FIB from the larger move is right in that area....

Hi, Expo, why your indicator is on left side, but what I downloaded is on right side? Besides that, we only focus on what is potential which shows by the indicator?

Hi Eddy.  
  
Go to the inputs and change these two numbers to 10 and 50. That will put the indicator in the upper left.

Agree.   
  
Day traders likely trying to grab some pips on a retracement back to 112.25 area. I still believe the bigger players will be looking to build short positions going forward. For me, the immediate risk is to the down side.   
  
Cheers and good luck

Hi friend.  
  
Sorry, I just noticed your post. I'm always looking for any Renko indicators that are better but this is the one I'm using right now.

You can adjust the brick size as well as the "shift percentage" to smooth it out to your liking. This is the setting I am using at the moment.

You're welcome. I always use the 2 minutes TF.   
  
I just made an offline 15 minute chart just to see if the Renko chart looked the same, and it did. You just have to make sure the indicator is set at 15 minute renko TF.

Hey Pipmaster,  
I haven't been paying too much attention recently as I've had an intense piece of work to do (UK A level chemistry marking) but I posted a couple of weeks ago (maybe) about a potentially good Higher time frame set up on this instrument. I haven't checked out your H1 set up, but if it all ties up then there's more confluence there.  
Cheers and good luck,  
  
Stuart

Hey traders.  
  
I'll be getting on a plane tonight, heading to back to the east coast for a family reunion and a week long vacation. Thread has been fizzling out a bit. Hope to re energize when I get back.  
  
Will be monitoring my trades from my phone and checking up on the thread but won't be really getting much screen time for the charts.  
  
Cheers, -Kurt

You're welcome Eddy.  
  
Finding the WWs is the same on all TFs. The "extdepth" setting is just used to make the zig zag fit the wave. A lot of times I can see the WW with the naked eye but the indicator isn't picking it up on certain settings. So I try different TFs and different extdepth settings to try and find the combination that will show the wave with the zig zag. Sometimes it may not be possible. No problem, I just draw them manually.

im in 2 long positions from 140.65 and 1.3990... in case price goes lower i am happy to buy more all the way down to 137 with 75 pip gaps if we get there.... if we break 1.3650 then ill reverse the trades.  
  
My current view is that we see a double top so price reaching 148, thereafter?? possible slight rejection and then higher to 155/160 levels... will reevaluate the situation once there. Would be nice to see price reach and break 142 and 142.60 and ill gain more confidence in adding on any dips thereafter..... There is no news during the day to push GBP higher, except for MPC Member Forbes Speaks @ 7pm time. Since yesterdays Queens speech allegedly triggered the upmove i see price moving higher slowly throughout the day and then rallying another 100 pip+ during that speech ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) hehe  
  
Overall i feel there is one more leg higher for this pair to go....... if i could date it, i'd say mid/end of July we form a fresh high and come September this pair becomes a sell. August is a month i try and stay out of the markets... HOLIDAY TIME!

If the trend have out from the blue triangle like what I circuit in the photo. Will it consider not a good symmetric and not trade even if the price will drop to sweet zone?

Price staying above 140.50 is a good sign so far, i would like to see a touch of 142+ and then a push towards 143 in coming days, then i see clear path to reach and hold at 145.... ever getting closer to that potential double top at 148... i have not added as yet to my 2 long positions, but if we reach 142+ see a pullback and then push higher i will add on the 142 level (2nd attempt)....  
  
If all goes against me i have already moved my stops that allow my trades to breathe but also guarantee me a small profit.  
  
Happy Trading week to all

Duly added to my positions at 142, as i am writing this the pair has just popped +20pips, big week for GBP and tomorrow probably being the biggest... if any hint of good news from Carney then this will fly! I also think the deal with DUP and coming queens speech will all be GBP positive, im hopefull but charts starting to look bullish and retest of 142.80 now seems quite likely.  
  
HAppy trading and Green pips to all!

Price is nicely above 143 level and price looking very bullish an wanting to test 144+ where we might see a retrace, if not then 144.70/145 will be next target.  
For my next entry into this pair i dont want to buy in anymore if price gets above 145, so i am hoping after a touch of the levels ive mentioned we get a slight retrace then i will add more around the 143+ levels, but i will NOT add more now.  
  
I now have ALL my 3 positions with SL levels in a profitable zone so now am trading risk free on all 3 trades.  
  
Hope some of you caught this too!

Hello Expo33, Parviz, PipsMaster23, and all others that share their knowledge and wisdom :-)  
I am a newbie and is "playing" with playmoney. As such i am very thankful that you all share your findigs with the rest of us that isn't that experienced but really want to learn how it works, and hopefully will be ready to stand on our own two feet someday. Thank you for your patience with "stupid" questions, you are able to answer them in a way so that the rest of us can understand, once again thank you very much for your efforts.  
  
Keep up the good work folks

So 144+ (144.21at my brokerage) and now we are in a profit taking or retrace whatever you want to call it, a pullback to 143.50/30 zone would be ideal to load 1 more long position for me and target next area of 145.10.... and hopefully see price just range their before another push up towards that 148...  
  
So far these trades are doing what has been expected, but always expect the unexpected hehe...

So far these trades are doing what has been expected, but always expect the unexpected hehe...

So price nicely retraced to 143.26 (my broker price) i managed to get in with a pending order at 143.35, this is my 4th position long into this pair and i will not be adding anymore to it and hopefully can see this reach 148 where i will look to take out partial profits and reevaluate the situation.   
  
So far going well! All positions are protected and no matter what happens now i am in risk free trades and in profit. Just need the market to push higher and higher!! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

beautiful boost in price action as i write this we are now at 145.30, my target for extra certainty of this move to 148 level was a touch and break of 145.10 and stay above this level.... i will now just move all my stops to 143.35... come on 148!!!  
  
Hope you guys caught this

check my post on EURUSD, USDJPY but also the short call on GBPJPY before its current rise again: [https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...99#post9882399](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=9882399#post9882399)  
  
if any dips occur on EURUSD towards 1.1260 but no lower than 1.11, should still be considered a buy, i can see this going to 1.1570+ and even possibly 1.17 before a significant retracement only for it to go one more leg higher towards 1.20+ by German Elections and then fly some more ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
I also GBPUSD stronger heading to 1.32+ and of course GBPJPY 148 very soon ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f3c1.png?v=15.1)

Hello all, back from vacation!!  
  
Have lots to catch up on but wanted to post this set up. Lately it has been risk on. Also Oil has been surging bringing CAD/JPY into the zone on the daily. Looks like oil may have a little room in the short term to go higher but for me 86.60-86.90 looks like s good spot to get short. Not a trade recommendation, just me thinking out loud

Hi mate  
the answer is simple :  
  
// put in extern variables section//  
  
extern string CurrencyName = "EURUSD"; //or any pair you want//  
extern int TimeFrame = 43200;  
  
// placed somewhere within your code//  
double PreviousClose = iClose (NULL, TimeFrame, 1);  
  
MonthHigh = iHigh(Symbol(),PERIOD_MN1,43200,1);  
MonthLow = iLow(Symbol(),PERIOD_MN1,43200,1);  
MonthClose = iClose(Symbol(),PERIOD_MN1,43200,1);  
or  
double PreviousHigh = iHigh (CurrencyName, TimeFrame, 0);  
double PreviousLow = iLow (CurrencyName, TimeFrame, 0);  
double PreviousClose = iClose (CurrencyName, TimeFrame, 0);  
cheers  
Alex

You are right, it is your job and you decide if you share it, as you share it and to whom, however you do not have to act with pride and prejudice, I have more than two years operating wolfe waves, original theory, modified theories and CWW, and not I have stopped learning a single day.   
  
The secret of wolfe waves in theory that you like, is always the management of positions, you think you know well, but if you really had half the experience that I have, you would have known that it is not necessary take all the waves that appear, I take 3-5 regularly for a week, and experts take 2-3 a week. I only ask you to pay more attention to your words, you are asking that to be a candidate to offer feedback, we need 200 trades published, that could take up to 1.5 years, and that amount is at least like a single person publishes 10% of the posts which now exist. Finally if you review the extraordinary work of Parviz, you should have noticed that the quality of his work, it was only possible to achieve it in such a short time, thanks to all of us here, little or a lot of feedback is the most valuable you will be able to get here, and if you want to believe me ask Parviz.   
  
Regards  
Max

All stops on GBPJPY are now at 144.65, target still remains 148 for any partial profit taking or otherwise i let the trades hit my stop.  
  
GBPUSD targeting 1.32 - have a position from 1.2910 which is now a risk free trade , having put a trail stop of 55pips just now  
  
EURUSD seems to be getting comfortable above 1.1375 (now at 1.1412) providing the level holds this can go to 1.16 by the the time of NFP next week.  
  
its been a good week, hope you all made GREEN pips!  
  
Have a great weekend 

Cheers!!PM23

Question: How to get the previous monthly High/low/close value in EA (not in indicator) MonthHigh = iHigh(Symbol(),PERIOD_MN1,????????????); MonthLow = iLow(Symbol(),PERIOD_MN1,????????????); MonthClose = iClose(Symbol(),PERIOD_MN1,???????????);

Hi :  
1)I am not sure what is your Question here. The third argument in the iHigh() function is the shift , it means Bar No. for which you want the function to return, its value, to you.  
The last bar is zero the previous one is 1. So for previous month high ,the shift is 1 and MonthHigh = iHigh(Symbol(),PERIOD_MN1,1), and for two month ago it is iHigh(Symbol(),PERIOD_MN1,2).  
  
2) if you need a function to return the number of minute of a time frame ,whatever notation that you send to it as a string argument ....  
this little function may help:  
int StringToTimeFrame(string tfs)  
{  
int tf=0;  
if(tfs=="M1" || tfs=="1" ||tfs=="m1") tf=PERIOD_M1;  
if(tfs=="M5" || tfs=="5" ||tfs=="m5") tf=PERIOD_M5;  
if(tfs=="M15"|| tfs=="15" ||tfs=="m15") tf=PERIOD_M15;  
if(tfs=="M30"|| tfs=="30" ||tfs=="m30") tf=PERIOD_M30;  
if(tfs=="H1" || tfs=="60" ||tfs=="h1") tf=PERIOD_H1;  
if(tfs=="H4" || tfs=="240" ||tfs=="h4") tf=PERIOD_H4;  
if(tfs=="D1" || tfs=="1440" ||tfs=="d1") tf=PERIOD_D1;  
if(tfs=="W1" || tfs=="10080" ||tfs=="w1") tf=PERIOD_W1;  
if(tfs=="MN" || tfs=="43200" ||tfs=="mn") tf=PERIOD_MN1;  
if(tf==0) tf=Period();  
return(tf);  
}  
  
I hope this would help you.  
sincerely parviz

I have fixed this problem, when in backtest (Symbol(),PERIOD_MN1,43200,1) will not work due to the backtest wont use data which is too old.  
  
So in real trading...no problems at all.  
  
Anyway, pls. leave an email address and your ACC.NO. then you will receive a lifetime free copy including future updates very soon.  
  
I also want to invite you to CWW discussion, if you have time pls. post your trades here... thanks!

Here is a brief introduction for EA:  
  
1 XABCD Style  
  
Once a CWW was found by Praviz's indi...We will draw a Fibo Extension on XA or BC( if BC is too short we use XA, if both are too short we use previous ZZ swing)  
  
After you finished drawing, put EA into the chart and choose an Area you want to trade **NEAR D Point**.  
  
In this case I choose 176.4-223.6, that means trade 2 lvls on 176.4 & 223.6...  
  
EA will automatically find entry point and Draw XC line then set a time to stop.  
  
So users only need to choose trading areas...EA will finish everything else for you.

Hello traders. Sorry, been super busy lately.  
  
As suspected WTI OIL has surged all the way up to $47. The Yen has been fairly week across the board today and has brought CAD/JPY right into an important supply zone at about 87.23. This is about 40 pips past AB=CD completion. Not a huge amount considering the daily time frame. For me a good spot to get short.   
  
**CAD/JPY DAILY CWW**

Red circles are necessary setting:  
  
1 directions- buy or sell  
  
2 Area - near D point  
  
3 TDI must break H/L in CD wave, that means TDI Green line must break TDI High line in Wave CD for Sell, buy vice versa.  
（if u see TDI has already break the H/L line, set to false. otherwise set to ture）  
  
4 AUTO Fibo Trading Area (set to false and you have to manually set entry start and stop point)  
  
4.1 If you leave stop point as blank EA will only trade once and a stop loss line will appear and you have to move it manually.  
  
4.2 If Set 2 entries, stop loss is automatic.  
  
5 Zigzag match with praviz's indi, XC line should be matched, if not EA will not work properly.

You can add divergence or hidden divergence to this strategy. But it's too many indies already. I am not sure that the EA is going to work well  
Probably, it is better to create a new EA: WW+Hidden Divergence ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

i can do it, but....  
  
TDI Divergence indi is not working properly, and none Divergence indi of any types can replace human judgement...  
  
In other word, all divergence indi is not reliable.

i'm using a very stupid way to find the Time out point.  
  
**It is B point + XAB time + Weekend time = time out point**  
  
I want to re-program the time out function, but i did not have the code for counting bars like the praviz's indi...  
  
Could Anyone create a bar counting code for me?  
  
For EX.  
  
**XAB = 30 bars and EA will stop trade if 30 bars passed after B Point.**

Hi:  
As i said the current bar is always the zero bar , and we can't use negative bar number for future bar eg.: Time[-30 ]; return error.  
So you should calculate it indirectly like this for example:  
future_bar_time=Time[0]+30*Period()*60;  
this will give you time for the 30th bar after the current bar in seconds passed since 00:00 a.m. 1st of January 1970.  
(Time[Bar No.] ,is a Series array that contains open time of each bar of the current chart.)

I also have sth not sure and need your suggestion:  
  
**Which fibo extension should be used? XA or BC, any rules for that?**  
  
**What do u think about CD expire function? currently it is D+5 candles.**

Hummm...do you mean how can i manager size between micro and standard ACC.?  
  
Of course, EA will trade 100 times bigger in micro than that in standard.  
  
But...some brokers use strange symbols such as "Gold" "Goldmicro" "Gold." instead of "XAUUSD" "XAUUSD." etc...EA can not recognize it.

Thanks！  
  
my purpose is to consolidate everybody's trade...We use same method and the result must be the same :-)  
  
Cheers!  
  
I have some bug fixed in Version 13, i will post it later.  
  
In this case Entry#1 was bypassed, so EA will adjust it's strategy to trade only one fibo lvls.  
  
Whatever, EA is good at catching the turning point and avoiding the falling knife.

Actually no, i meant instead of positions opening with 0.01 (which they do now) how can i adjust this so that it opens 0.1 or 1.00 lots?

Thank you sir, for sharing your valuable information , but would you please also share your trading rules and MM strategy, how and when do you select to trade a pair , how do you engage , on what basis you determine your SL and TP , when do you break even , when you trail stop a trade , how do you determine the target of the traded pair ....  
To cut the long short would you please teach us fishing , and not giving us the fish  
I really admire your style of trading and i am eager to learn it from you.  
sincerely parviz

Hi Parviz,  
I suspect Pipmaster is much like myself in that he trades price action from reading charts competently and taking discretionary trades (Pipmaster please correct me if I am wrong). I have received the message loud and clear that this is probably not the correct 'place' / thread to promote those methods. In any case, it is not something one can teach to a community easily. Discretionary PA trading is an art / skill that is acquired over a very very long time and I would imagine that most (not all) people that follow this thread should not be advised to start trading in this way. In order to do it successfully and consistently one has to understand risk, reward AND probability of a successful trade outcome. Everyone can set a stop and a profit target (risk and reward) but relatively few traders understand the probability aspect ( ie the critical variable that determines whether they will have a mathematical edge or not) unless they either have a strategy where they have taken hundreds of trades and generated statistics or understand how to read charts.  
Just an opinion. I should point out that the GBPJPY move has been outlined from a Wolfe Wave perspective by both myself and (I think) Expo if you want to look at previous posts.  
  
Cheers  
Stuart

Thank you very much sir for your response :  
But the thing is that , I am not a successful trader as i have stated before ,trying variety of strategies and MM rules ,and let me tell you i am not lazy in reading and learning , since i was university professor for more than 28 years, apparently no body, here in trading ,(in contrast to what i have learned , and thought to do in an academic environment )is willing to disclose his success story and strategy , even if you can not say it in this thread , why don't you start a new one and teach us what you know , or show me the way that i can trade like you , let say within 10 years from now.  
  
I recall most of the time what our great poet KHIAM has said : "Nobody know what is there in the next life , and when one get informed ,may not inform others".  
  
The other thing is that ,after trading for nearly three years ,sometimes i really suspect that nobody is earning real money trading forex ,except ,banks , large companies ,peoples who write books about it ,or those who set teaching courses and webinars .....![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f622.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)

Hi Parviz,  
Thank you for your reply buddy. Look, I am not a professor (I am a doctor (PhD) though!) and I am not an expert trader - yet. I aspire to be one and as well as carving out my own 'strategy' I also like to take discretionary trades based on reading charts. I am sorry but I cannot teach you to do this. I have attended many webinars, courses etc but I find very little useful information for how I want to trade. That is not to say that all the information I am exposed to is useless, but I will say that I cannot use most of it because of how I view the market. I will also say that if you find a strategy that you can relate to and that works for you then grab it with both hands and do everything you can to make it work for you. If you really want to learn how to read charts and trade 'properly' then start with Al Brookes. He's brilliant. His books are hard to read at first but by the third time you read them they're ok! His video course is excellent too. His methods are hard to implement from a psychological perspective and that is the main thing that holds most traders back whatever system or strategy they trade. If you want suggestions of texts to read I can provide that, but other than that it's just market exposure. I tend to print out 15, 5 and 2 min FTSE charts for every day and keep them for future reference. There's no easy ride!  
All the best  
Stuart

Reading Chart is a hard job, you have manually do a lot of things :  
  
Trend line, Box, fibonacci, PA breakout or false break....read NEWs and judge good or bad....  
  
After you learned that, another 5 years has been pasted... but still no guarantee on success.  
  
Finally you found that trading is not suit to everyone, only the talented people (lighting reflex or smart like Einstein）can make profit, the rest all become losers....  
  
I have no talent and i dont want to end up like this so I find my self an option.

Trading is not supposed to be easy! If it were easy then anyone with 'no talent' would be able to make money. However, you are trying to take money from other smart traders (or computers) so you have to be, on average, smarter than them. That does not mean 'cleverer'. There are many people out there who have brains the size of Jupiter who would not make good traders. Nothing is certain and people do not like dealing with uncertainty. This is why it is important to have an understanding of probability because trading is about consistently executing your positive expectancy plan in order to come out on top in the long term. Any one particular trade is of no consequence, whether it be a winner or loser. Each trade is just part of the plan and it is necessary to have losers in order to be able to have the (bigger) winners etc etc. Anyone who has the right psychology, or can train themselves to have the right psychology can become a good trader. I'm still working on that part truth be told! If you want to make a living in any profession, you have to train and get good at whatever it is that you decide to do. One does not become an excellent accountant, lecturer, scientist, store-owner / business person overnight. It takes time, effort and hard work and anyone who does not realise this and is not willing to put in the hard work deserves to lose. It doesn't matter if you are trading an actual system/strategy like Wolfe Waves or if you are trading by purely reading the price action. What you need is understanding.  
Re: News - I pay absolutely no attention to news because I don't understand how to trade it and even if I did, the computers trading the news are far quicker than I could ever be. Let the news happen, observe what the market is telling you and trade accordingly.   
Re: Fibonacci - I have been through this before  
Breakout / false break - all to do with reading the price action. It IS hard, but you can increase your probability by letting the breakout succeed or fail. If it succeeds, there will usually be a breakout pullback trade where you can get in - usually at a worse price because you have gained probability so it must be paid for in risk.  
etc   
SO in short: Trading is gambling if you do not have a plan and do not understand what the chart in front of you is saying- agreed. But, put the work, time, sweat, blood, tears into it and come up with a positive expectancy plan and you have a good chance of coming up with a something that can work, if you trade it properly and have worked on 'your' psychology.

Thanks for your long story....  
  
If you have a plan then trading is not gambling....right?  
  
Do u believe that? Again....Do u really believe that?  
  
To distinguish what is certainty...what is uncertain...  
  
**For E.X,**  
  
**Your father is a CEO and people want to bribe him.**  
  
**So they send someone to buy your house with a down payment of 10% value of the house.**  
  
**Next week they cancel the deal and you get 10% money of your house.**  
  
**This is called certainty, 100% winning solution, 0% risk to be failed.**

Hi Parviz, sorry for late reply but i saw that salamanda replied to you in a very honest and truthful way and pretty much answered your question... i did post a slight insight into how i trade when i first posted here, but also mentioned that it would not be right for me to do so on a forum which is all to do with WW.  
  
Without giving too much of my fish away ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) i choose GBPJPY as it is known as the beast, simply put, when it moves in a direction it can do 400+pips while other correlated pairs will struggle doing 180+ pips or less... SL and TP are purely envisaged from Daily and weekly charts as these TF go more in line to my manual approach in trading. Anything lower id prefer to use an EA as it would make my eyes blinker LOL   
  
Salamanda stated and i quote: Discretionary PA trading is an art / skill that is acquired over a very very long time and I would imagine that most (not all) people that follow this thread should not be advised to start trading in this way. In order to do it successfully and consistently one has to understand risk, reward AND probability of a successful trade outcome.

Here are my charts... not much to see, i am not one for trend lines, Oscillators and all that... PA is king and a MACD in regards to finding extremes in the market.  
  
Fibs i use as a zone area in order to watch PA but thats it. The major facotr for me is FAILURE SWINGS and identifying a trend and trying to find out where you are within a trend.

Thank you for introducing this concept. I was using a similar concept before but this one feels better to me. I have been testing it out on various pairs. It seems to work quite nicely once you start to ignore the price manipulations and look at the wave without the fluctuations.

The entry was made before. For buy not sell from point D. The rest of the trade lines you see are just scalps I was doing at that time on shorter time frame.

Hi Expo,  
  
thanks for the Daily Wave on Eurcad. I've noticed there is a H4 Wave also on Eurcad that will have a C4 of 1.47260 will this override the Daily wave? Could  
I trouble you for the Indi that makes it possible to switch between pairs? The wave indi takes a lot out of my M/C if I have too many pairs open.  
Thanks for this great thread.

Hi:  
At this point of time, both CWW are pointing to the bullish trend, so it can be a kind of confirmation for the next move...  
I believe you may enter long , with best RR ratio (SL would be just below the complex correction area), Break even at 38.2% of the CD line Fib and aim to take profit at 61.8% of it or trial stop from there....(base on lower H4 time Frame)

Hi Rostaus.  
  
A few points to note.  
  
1) In my opinion, the higher time frame takes precedence over the smaller time frame.  
  
2) The wave you posted isn't valid as price moves above point C. If you change the extdepth setting to 12 you get a valid CWW on the 4H. I've posted it below. It has already broken far below the AB=CD point. I would say it was mainly due to the short term fundamentals being very positive for the Canadian dollar. For example, the rate hike on July 12th coupled with strong oil prices for the week. Another reason why the bigger time frame should be considered. The technical analysis tends to absorb the short fundamental moves.  
  
3) I tend to avoid these types of waves. Barely convergent with little to no real sweet zone. Its closer to channel trading

I did not notice what expo pointed out , you are using an old version of the indicator, in newer versions, if price pass c4 ,it would not show potential cww ,and consider it as failure.

Ahh the idiot/naive people that believe there is a such a pattern as a wolfe wave that will bring profits in the long run. There is no secret pattern in forex such as elliot wave, gann, harmonics, and wolfe waves. Especially such a basic 1,2,3,4,5 wolfe wave pattern. You are trying to find relativity in something where relativity does not exist (markets). On top of that you are using something that is stationary when trying to quantify something that is non-stationary.  
  
Two words - "order flow" - that's all that matters.

You intend to prove me wrong, but that will never happen. Show me even a 5 year backtest on h1 with at least 300 trades using wolfe waves. Call me pessimistic or a "downer" it doesn't matter. I speak from experience.  
  
Think logically here for a second. Wolfe waves are not new, they are not proprietary, not a secret, incredibly basic, and most people that are even remotely involved in trading know about them. So, if they do work and consistently make money why doesn't everyone in the world use them and make money?  
  
Do you think banks or hedge funds are sitting back at there desks looking for wolfe wave patterns? The answer is "no". So why are you?  
  
You are not a trader, you are someone looking at getting into trading as seen from you profile - "things to do today, visit forex factory, read amazing strategy, and make a billion dollars" You are simply looking to copy someone else illogical work.

What do u know about bank trader/hedge funds? sounds like you were working there before?  
  
And what do mean"copy someone else illogical work"? If you think this method is illogical, tell me which method here is logical. I god damX sure you will find NONE on this forum.  
  
If someone is already in the winning pool, there is no reason for them to come back and tell you how.

I am starting to think you may be right. WW's work perfectly when back-tested but not so great in predicting future moves.

> Ahh the idiot/naive people that believe there is a such a pattern as a wolfe wave that will bring profits in the long run. There is no secret pattern in forex such as elliot wave, gann, harmonics, and wolfe waves. Especially such a basic 1,2,3,4,5 wolfe wave pattern. You are trying to find relativity in something where relativity does not exist (markets). On top of that you are using something that is stationary when trying to quantify something that is non-stationary. Two words - "order flow" - that's all that matters.

it is a perfect CWW, but you can not trade until the bid rate come out...  
  
Trading higher TF can minimize the influence of the NEWS, except bid rate/NFP.

If NEWS will be released within 24 bars in the future, all signal will be delayed until news came out. (not apply to D1)

Close of play Friday.  
As you can see, I don't like my charts too cluttered and colour etc. options on indi are great for cleaning it up if required.  
Blue horizontal lines are previous support/resistance

Thanks for posting and best trading to you.  
  
This scenario highlights the main reason why I like trading Wolfes waves. We don't need to know where price is going, we only need to be prepared if price gets to the general completion zone. It also highlights the versatility of "parviz1953" WW indicator.  
  
Different zigzag settings gives two different potential scenarios. An interesting and unique situation. Bullish/bearish scenarios below. Neither scenario may play out, but if one does, I'll be ready with my scale in zone

We don't need to know where price is going, we only need to be prepared if price gets to the general completion zone. It also highlights the versatility of "parviz1953" WW indicator. Different zigzag settings gives two different potential scenarios. An interesting and unique situation. Bullish/bearish scenarios below. Neither scenario may play out, but if one does, I'll be ready with my scale in zone WTI CRUDE 4H POTENTIAL...

Bearish wave near completion, getting short at the 161FIB ext

Hi, Expo33:  
I've been reading this thread for some time so far and learned a lot. Just wanna say a big 'thank you' to you and everyone that's contributed to make it what it is today!   
But I do have a question: when you do your pre-trade analysis (as in post#1286), where do you place your INITIAL STOPLOSS when you scale in? I can't find this being discussed anywhere in the thread (correct me if I'm wrong)? Can you talk about it a little bit?  
Thank you for your time and help!

Hi Shuo and thanks for posting  
  
I am heading out the door very soon until tomorrow morning. So to give you a short answer I think the stop loss will be dependent a lot on your risk profile.  
  
From a price action standpoint. I try and use the FIB extensions as a guide as well as previous S/R levels. It is always a work in progress. Recently, I have been studying supply/demand zones as a way to find prudent stop loss levels. I think each trader will see price action a bit differently so stop losses may be a personal style rather than a hard rule.   
  
My main thought when placing stop losses is to make sure I give the trade enough room to breathe. I try and think where the market makers will likely be trying to blow up retail traders and then place my stop a bit farther above or below that level. If need be I just reduce my position size and use a bigger stop just to give my trade a little more breathing room without taking on anymore risk.  
  
I hope this helps but I think it ultimately is a function of experience in finding out what works thru trial and error.  
  
Good luck friend.

Hi Guys  
I have been reading this thread all day & it seems i found people with a similar focus. I have been studying Harmonic patterns mostly & Wolfe waves fits in quite nicely .Anything that runs of the back of Elliot wave theory appeals to me. Anyway just wanted to introduce & myself hope to participate more in the near future.

Welcome and thanks for posting.  
  
I think most would agree that in many instances (not always) Wolfe waves are the end points of larger harmonic structures, just more basic and a bit easier to understand.  
  
Look forward to your input

I can only speak for myself.  
  
Yes, I've been trading Wolfe waves for about a year now and it has been consistent and profitable. The indicator that "parviz" developed has made the process of finding waves much simpler. It frees up more time to sift thru many waves to find the ones that appear to have the best probability of success.  
  
I haven't had any free time for the past few months and haven't posted much so it seems the thread is dying off a bit. Maybe that's a sign that traders aren't finding Wolfe waves very profitable. I really don't know.   
  
Cheers and good luck

Still tinkering with Renko and stumbled upon a new Renko generator developed by a generous and gifted member named "tgdrela1"  
  
This indicator is excellent in functionality and versatility. Perfect for me in testing out new ideas.  
  
Thread, indicators, templates, and you tube video instructions here: <https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=684131>  
  
Worth checking out if you are interested in Renko trading  
  
Here's a couple of WWs back to back with the 200FIB extension reigning supreme!![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60e.png?v=15.1)  
  
Also highlights the fact that WWs don't necessarily need to reach the full AB=CD completion price. Both WWs reverse prior to AB=CD but price in both cases has clearly broken the XB trend line and entered fully into the sweet zone.

Price hits the profit target line of the first Wolfe wave which just happens to be the endpoint of a second Wolfe wave.  
  
Coincidence? Or is it the harmonic nature of the market?

Two WWs on the DAILY completing at the same level. That's an edge. Reversal took place only 20 pips from AB=CD

Hi Expo33:  
Is the second WW manually drawn?  
I have not read all the posts yet but can one trade from the C point ?  
Many thanks.

I think this question has come up once before.  
  
For me, the answer would be no. WW theory is based on completed waves and the idea that price has become harmonically out of balance.  
  
Yes, the second wave was drawn manually just to make it easier to see

Hi, Expo33:  
In posts #1,267 & #1,835, you mentioned 'manually drawing the waves'. I was wondering if you use any special tool to do that and put the'12345' directly on your mt4 charts after you've detected the waves and removed the indicator? Thx for your help!

Hi Shuo.  
  
Sometimes, after the WW indicator has detected a wave, I will draw two triangles using the MT4 tringle function and then delete the indicator. The WW indi uses a fair amount of CPU and slows down my computer if I have too many charts up at once with the indicator.  
  
Other times I just just the WW manually using the MT4 trend line function, text function etc.  
  
Cheers

Hi, fantom, regarding your ‘ger H1’ trade above (post #1,844), it was a nice trade!  
I just have a few questions that I hope you can somehow clarify:

  1. After reading some of your previous posts, I noticed you always had a very precise entry ‘ 5’. How did you do that? Can you talk about your **thought process** in entering a Wolfe wave and placing your initial stoploss?
  2. Also I saw you have a few other indicators on your chart (dots, red lines and better volume), what are they for? Anything to do with trading Wolfe wave?

Sorry for so many questions and thank you for your time and help!  
Shuo

Hi fantom  
  
I also have thought about using Andrew's Pitchfork as tool to determine the exit, but never was really convinced. My idea was to use it inside the WW structure mainly using B(3) and C(4) to set it up. (For example: X(1) B(3) C(4) as basis). Would be interested to read about your ideas/experiences using AP.  
  
All the best  
Positino

Hi Expo33, great thread with very clear and precise explanations. Good job mate.  
  
I haven't read all of the pages here but I see that you have been applying Wolfe Waves to Renko charts and that has caught my interest as I am also a fan of Renko. I have also done a little bit of renko WW trading.  
  
I'm curious about your thoughts regarding the benefits of renko Wolfe Waves. Are there any compared to regular time frame charts? Or do renko charts just offer a different angle with nothing better or worse than normal TF charts? Would you stick to trading renko WWs or would that mean missing too many opportunities on regular charts with not enough opportunities on the renko charts? (no need to answer these one by one, these are just a few things buzzing around in my head). I'm just curious about your opinion.  
  
Also I would like to say that I love the work by Parviz in creading the WW Indicators - they are awesome (and free!!)

Hi Wiz.  
  
Thanks for the compliments. My apologies for such a late response. I've been really busy lately.  
  
I've always been intrigued by Renko charts. They appeal to my visual senses. My Wolfe wave journey is still a work in progress so I don't have all the answers.  
  
For me the only potential downside to Renko when using them for WW analysis is that in many instances they show symmetry when in fact there is no symmetry. For example, when leg AB takes nearly the same number of candles to complete as leg CD. Since Renko is based on price and not time, you will see perfectly symmetrical Renko WWs that really aren't symmetrical when you look at the candlestick chart.  
  
One thing I really like is how easy it is to see previous S/R, demand and supply zones, etc.  
  
Here's a snapshot of the same WW, candlestick style and Renko side by side just to see the visual benefit of Renko.

Anyways, thanks for dropping by. I value any input you have. As I said from the start, this is still a work in progress. Unfortunately, I over committed myself in my local community until Christmas so the thread has been dying as of late. Starting in the new year I'll have free time to try and revive this thread.  
  
Cheers mate, stay safe and stay green

Hi Simba.  
  
There isn't a summary of _this_ thread but there's a pdf link on post #1 that has a very basic overview of WW theory.  
  
I would suggest reading through the whole thread if you are serious about using WWs as part of your trading plan.  
  
Cheers

Haven't pulled the trigger on this one as I'm a but leery of trading against the dollar at the moment. Will wait until tomorrow's NFP print and maybe enter long if it disappoints.

Hello Mate and thank you.  
  
I mislabeled point C and had two point D's. I corrected that and put up a new chart. Actually AC and XB do converge. Not by much, but they are converging and meet a long way off in the future. But you are right it is very close to a channel type trade. That is another reason I haven't taken this trade. I like there to be more convergence with a significant trend line break.

I use the 8.5 version.  
  
I only change the inputs for visual changes to the colors I like. I just put the indicator on the chart and then check different time frames, and change the zig zag settings to fit any potential waves. Just play around with the indicator to see what works for you.

Price surged past AB=CD to about 37 pips, but with a prudent stop loss we are now 100 pips in the green

is the first time i use an indicator for the wolfe waves, and i think it s great, but the problem is that all versions block the platform when i change to a small tf like 5m or 15m. Is there a solution or a smallest version of this indicator?

Hello there everyone!  
  
I just recently stumbled upon Wolfe Waves and find them fascinating. Also in search of information about Wolfe Waves I came across this thread and I really like what I've read so far. A big thank you to all those who contribute to this great thread, especially to Expo33 for all his work here. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
I'm already trying to find some WW. So far I stumbled across the AUDCAD daily and I think there could be a WW building up. What do you guys think about it?  
  
In the area of the sweet zone seems to be at least some kind of area of support, if you look at the weekly chart.  
  
I'm curious what you guys think about it.

What I also want to ask is, if it's still a valid WW even if it takes a long time till price hits EPA? Like in the example below. I guess a good entry would have been after the pinbar marked with the red arrow.

I'm currently trading USDCHF. I didn't get a good entry, but if it hits XC-extension I'm happy. So far it's doing well.

I'm currently trying my luck with trading EURJPY M10. I did see this a bit late, but as of now there is around a 1:2 RRR if EPA is reached.

Possible WW evolving in the German DAX M30. Although I'm not sure if this is a valid one. Anyway, price already entered the sweet zone, but CD is still substantially shorter than AB so I guess it's not yet time to enter.

Hi Knurren.  
  
This isn't a Wolfe wave. For a bearish WW points B and D would need to be making higher highs

Hi Knurrem, it can't be a wolfe wave because C point has to break XA range

Use one of the 3 versions on post #1. They are 100x better than any other WW indicators

There is a more recent WW on NZD/USD 4H and it had near perfect AB=CD symmetry in regards to price and especially time

The confirmation I was using for the EUR/JPY WW was actually from another system based on weekly pivots. I just didn't want to confuse anyone with stuff that hasn't been discussed here. If you are interested, the thread is here: <https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=588764>  
  
Here is my EUR/JPY chart with Davit's pivot template. Price showed multiple rejections at important pivot level and also had a decent TDI cross:

Sometimes it just works out perfect. Price barely even moved more than 10 pips past AB=CD and hit the target line over 200 pips

Very interesting to add confirmation. There is always to learn. Thank you  
The bearish wolfe wave in the eur/jpy pair was brought up by the news of boj's Kuroda. Do you think it can cancel the wolfe wave?

For me the wave is still completely valid and still contained within the acceptable stop loss zone. Trades need breathing room and time.  
  
Also important to consider time frame and pair. EUR/JPY on the 4H will require a much larger stop loss than lets say the AUD/USD on a 30 minute time frame. So we will need smaller positions and more time to let the trade develop.  
  
In addition, the BOJ policy and Kuroda's rhetoric are the same every time so no real surprise

Also there is still an open gap near point C. I entered the trade with a small position an put TP a bit above the point where the gap would be closed.

AUDCHF M5. Doesn't look perfect somehow, but seems to work so far. Let's see how it evolves.

little bearish ww (not so good) in h1 on eurjpy but probably can help the biggest one in h4/D1 to make the price go down

For long term trades on eurcad, I raccomand to consider the bullish wolfe wave. In my opinion it's a really good one because the 5(D) point was formet by a little bearish WW that I highlighted with red lines. So take attention

Hi Parviz1955  
  
Actually i would like to thank you for your great work in creating these indicators.  
  
I have suggestions to develop indicator ver 9.7.2, ver 8.5 and ver 9.6.1  
  
_**For Complete and potential patterns,**_  
1- There is no need for green triangle , it is better to remove it or make it by user choice to make it on or off, we want to see easy clear chart.  
  
**_For "Complete patterns only - we are interested more in stability of point d and profit targets ":_**  
1- "As I understand these fibo values are changing as price moves - and only used to match with fibos shown in "search again" in case of complete pattern - and becomes fixed once price breaks top of green traingle, ash shown in chart 3 by yellow arrow ".  
For shown fibo percentage , We do not need all these fibo and in such format, we need fibos for D point only  
AB/XA =  
CD/BD =  
BC/AB =  
CD/XA =  
CD/AB =  
BD/XA =  
**(a) I suggest to replace it by (in same format below with the ability to change text size )**  
D/XA =  
D/Main =  
"Main , is fibo from z1 z2 , which represents LL or HH before point x , as shown in attached chart"  
D/BC =  
**(b) For Search again box :**  
(as i understand , these values are fixed and do not vary as price vary)  
**I-** Each Fibo must be shown in a different color and line format to be easily to easily distinguish between lines on chart  
**II -** I Suggest to only use the following fibos only:  
XA FIBO  
BC FIBO  
Main (Z1Z2) FIBO  
**III -** Add take profit points :  
TP1 : "Value " Horizontal line from X point  
TP2 : "Value " Horizontal line from C point  
TP3 : "Value " Horizontal line from A point  
  
_**For "Potential patterns only - we are interested in stability of point c":**_  
**1-** "As I understand these fibo values are changing as price moves, and only used to match with fibos shown in "search again" in case of complete pattern ".  
For shown fibo percentage , We do not need all these fibo and in such format, we need fibos for D point only  
AB/XA =  
CD/BD =  
BC/AB =  
CD/XA =  
CD/AB =  
BD/XA =  
**(a)** I suggest to replace it by (in same format below with the ability to change text size )  
C/XA =  
C/Main1 =  
"Main , is fibo from S1 S2 " As Shown in chart 2, which represents LL or HH before point x "  
C/AB =  
  
**(b)** For Search again box :  
(as i understand , these values are fixed and do not vary as price vary)  
**I-** Each Fibo must be shown in a different color and line format to be easily to easily distinguish between lines on chart  
**II -** I Suggest to only use the following fibos only:  
_(for Point c):_  
C/XA =  
C/Main1 =  
"Main , is fibo from S1 S2 " As Shown in chart 2, which represents LL or HH before point x "  
C/AB =  
_(For Point D)_  
D/XA FIBO  
D/BC FIBO  
D/Main (Z1Z2) FIBO as shown in chart 1  
  
I am ready for any clarifications  
Thank you in advance.

The white number is how many pips price has moved from the last ZIGZAG High/Low

For the EUR/CAD Daily you posted I'm not a big fan of X just being a random location. I see traders just picking X anywhere just to fit in it for the Wolfe wave. For me point X should be distinct, either a swing Hi/Lo point or at least a minor localized Hi/Lo  
  
If you look closely you can see that there actually was a valid classic bullish Wolfe wave that already has played out. Price rejected for a week straight at the 200FIB extension which was only 30 pips from perfect AB=CD completion. Not bad considering the impulse waves were over 500 pips each. Price then re-traced about 600 pips almost to the target line

The reason i chosed that X point is that the gap in particular cases let you put it on the level of B point. But the main reason i prefer my waves is that in AB there isn't any "bump" that interrupt the down move, thing that i pretend in my waves to draw a correct XC (target) line.  
Since it did not reach the target line, and there isn't any contrary wave, the wolfe waves have not been drawn correcly.  
I could be wrong, i'm young so i'm willing to learn from a trader with more experience in wolfe wave than me ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

The main point I was making is that for a bullish WW point X should be at least a minor low, thus point B and D are making lower lows. For me, point X can't just be any random point in space just to start a WW  
  
I took everything off the chart but added the fractals and there isn't even a single fractal anywhere along that impulse wave, so there is no X point for me

You are probably right, there is not even ab-cd pattern  
Would be possible to see some your analisys of wolfe waves that you have taken? That s because i have some gaps individuating and trading the the wolfe waves, and i think that would be inspiring for me, and help me find some more criteria for the entry

Many times I don't target the 1-4. In this case I risked 90 pips to win 180. Yen pairs have way to much exposure to geopolitical shananigans so I tend to be conservative.  
  
Interesting wave on EURCAD. Price is at the 161FIB extension which also correlates with Davit's S38 weekly pivot. The actual AB=CD completion price is about 30 pips lower at the 200FIB extension. Of course, full AB=CD completion isn't a requirement for a trade just a level to know. So far looks like price is holding.

I was also tracking this one as well. I'd be waiting for the 161FIB ext - S78 pivot level.  
  
For me, how I enter the position depends on whether I am scaling in with multiple small positions on the way down. Kind of a dollar cost averaging scale in method. For more volatile pairs, I tend to wait and monitor price action at the resistance zone and enter after a TDI cross. As traders we each will have a different style and/or risk management profile which will determine how we decide to take a position.

I think that's a good area to scale in as I spotted resistance from daily chart starting at around 1,337-ish. This level also coincides with the 176,40 fibo. Possible that price breaks down to this area and is rejected to the upside within a short period of time, which I'd rate as a good sign that it will move further to the upside. I'll likely scale in with 2 positions this time I guess, depending on how it goes. Thanks for your advice.

Always cautious but important to be prepared with your entry levels in advance. We are still 50 pips away from AB=CD level so the speech could be the catalyst that spikes price right down into our kill zone. Sometimes I like to have 10 tiny positions a few pips apart waiting in advance.  
  
Likely the Yellen speech will be a non event. We already heard her spiel last week.

Yes, a scale in zone. For example on the GBP/USD I'd have a zone of about 30 pips where I'd have 10 tiny long positions waiting that encompass price as it heads down to the AB=CD completion level and maybe even a bit farther. I use a script that makes it easy to set up.  
  
So it might look something like this. Once its set you can easily drag and drop the SLs and TPs if you want to change them

You're welcome Simba.  
  
I think a lot of it is a personal choice for each trader but as I said the point needs to be at least somewhat distinct form the localized price action. Maybe a fractal, minor or major swing point.  
  
Ideally, it's nice when X is a point that is already a along an impulse wave in a trend that is established. I've had some experienced Elliot wave traders say that the WW is potentially the end point of a larger Elliot wave structure and that the WW may may be the reversal point for that trend.

Hi pet,  
  
You have your wave backwards. There is no bearish WW. For a bearish WW with point X as your starting point, then point B and D would be making higher highs with D being the endpoint of the structure where price turns bearish.   
  
There is actually a bullish WW in play here. Starting at point X, then B has made a lower low, the endpoint D would be a new lower low and the reversal point where price turns bullish.  
  
Please see chart below  
  
**AUD/JPY**

Expo, are you expecting the D leg to complete? and if not is it still a valid WW and therefore you would still expect it to cross the take profit line? thanks in advance. Peter.

I never really know what to expect. I just make sure I'm prepared in advance if there is sufficient confluence around the completion zone. If I'm planning to take the trade I want to have my entry, SLs, and TPs mapped out in advance.

Mr. Expro33,  
  
I would like to think loudly with you  
  
**[1]**  
why we do not think of WW like Harmonic , and find out fibo between x,a,b,c and d ?  
  
As example,  
In Harmonic ,  
  
B (from ) XA (for most harmonic patterns) range from 38.2 to 88.0 %  
c (from) AB ,,,,,  
D (from) BC and  
D(from) XA, and so on.  
  
Actually i am monitoring completed patterns  
  
I think also paviz1953 can help in this issue , what is your mind ?  
  
**[2]**  
I suggested some improvements for indicators , what is your mind ?

Mr. Expo33  
  
We have to think how to benefit more from the numbers (pips/time) written over the zigzag  
  
Do you have an idea ?  
Is there is any thread discussing this idea ?

I think the indicator that "parviz" developed covers every aspect of the WW structure and is completely sufficient.  
  
Now, the most important part of the puzzle is to filter out the bad trades using a personalized system of confluence along with keeping an eye on fundamentals/sentiment/news.

What do you think about this possibility? A correction of at least 61,8% makes sense.

Hi simba, I'd gladly help you out, but as I don't use metatrader I have no template I could share. Also there are just some moving averages, RSI and the AO on my screen. I draw the trendlines, triangles and fibos manually.

Not a valid WW because lines XB and AC are not converging.

Yes it does but we kind of decided to forget about AWWs because it was causing to much confusion. I deleted them from the first post awhile ago.

Oh, my bad, sorry for that. I've only managed to read through half of the thread yet so I didn't know about dropping AWW. Thx for the info anyway. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Judging by the bigger picture I wonder if the CD-leg might reach the next daily resistance zone and the falling red trendline from the daily timeframe.

In the 4 hour chart there is a bearish divergence visible in the awesome indicator. This may indicate that the recent upward momentum is weakening.

USDCHF H1. A bit too late, but I guess there's still a possibility price might reach 141,40 fibo-level again which would be a good entry risk/reward-wise.

I noticed this one too as well but was prepared for entry so I missed it. Very nice symmetry

Dear Mr.  
Thank you for sharing your knowledge with us. I analyze the AUDCAD chart, and I'm expecting the price to fall to (D), would it be a good input, I mean, Wolfe wave pattern, would it be correct?

A potentially good longer term trade here on NZD/JPY. Still fairly risky considering the NZD election situation in addition to any further missile tests that might come out of North Korea. However, I just can't pass up this type of confluence especially with such an attractive risk/reward.  
  
1) A perfect Anti nen Star ( I know, traders may be rolling their eyes at these far out harmonic patterns)  
2) Near perfect AB=CD completion for our WW  
3) Completion level right at S68 which is the same as the Weekly S2  
4) Completion level also right at the DailyS2 (not shown on chart)  
5) Completion level right at 78.6FIB from overall re tracement  
5) Potential 4H Divergence without confirmation  
6) Completion level also at the 200FIB extension of BC (not shown on chart)  
7) And of course a nice carry trade

I was wondering if the price could break again down 2 of fibonacci (from BC) because the "sweet zone" is really sharp and the XB line became a resistence.

Price goes where it goes. All we can do is plan our trade and then trade our plan. Entry, SLs, and TPs determined in advance then let the trade breathe.

Hi Kenny.  
  
This is not a valid WW because Point B needs to be making a higher high from your starting point X.

Thanks Kurt! So normally if I don't see any WW here, I would just wait for it to form and then proceed on drawing, yes? Been practicing on the old data today haha. Gotta love backtesting! <3

Hi Kurt,  
  
USDJPY Daily Chart  
  
Would you say that the D leg (wave #5) is forming? Would you keep the lines there to wait for it to finish forming? Is this a valid CWW? :-)  
Hopefully this is not a stupid question haha.

Hi Kenny.  
  
Yes I would leave them there. Once I locate a valid WW that has started on the D leg, I then map out the completed wave by finding where the AB=CD is located. That doesn't mean that price has to reach that level to make it a valid wave, it's just a level I want to have mapped out in advance. Now I can see if that level or zone has any confluence (pivots, fib levels, S/R, supply/demand zones, etc etc). In this way I can know in advance if the completion level may offer a higher edge of reversal if price reaches full AB=CD.  
  
Having this done in advance lets me sit back and monitor price action as the D leg moves closer to the end point. Keeping an eye on the wave structure as far as symmetry as well as keeping an eye on the fundamentals/sentiment of the moment. If D is reached I am now prepared in advance to take action. Maybe I will be scaling in as the sweet zone is penetrated down towards point D. Or, maybe I will wait to monitor price action at point D and then enter after there is some sort of reversal confirmation.  
  
Finding the WWs should be like riding a bike or chewing gum. Once you get to that stage, then you can use your filtering tools to find the WWs that provide the best edge. It's an individual endeavor. Each trader will have a different style/method of entering a trade. In many ways it's an art form and the chart is the canvas.  
  
I look at the forex market as a living organism that lives and breathes based on the behavior of human beings. And all human beings, to some extent, are driven by fear and greed, especially in the forex market. Just remember that retail traders are the human prey and the market makers and big players are the predators. You must stay one step ahead at all times.  
  
Be prepared, be patience, and above all else, be prudent with your capital. Without proper risk management it won't matter what strategy you are using.  
  
Having NO position is still a position. The worst feeling in the world is chasing trades that aren't there and being so over leveraged that you have no available capital left to enter a trade when a golden opportunity arises.  
  
Cheers, -Kurt  
  
Here's a very basic process I go thru. Just the first layer of thinking. This is a WW that is 1000s of pips on GBP/JPY but a wave that I will keep stored and ready for future analysis and action if it remains valid.  
  
Potential wave found and mapped out. You can use "parviz" WW indi which finds the AB=CD level for you, or use a modified ZIGZAG indi that shows the pips for each leg, or you can just measure AB manually and put a horizontal line where point D should be. I like to do that then put 2 triangles on my chart to keep it from being cluttered with to many lines. So here it is, very basic, all mapped out.

Now I zoom out just to have a look at the bigger picture. Of course looking left we see some interesting activity. I notice the 50FIB retracment is right there at the AB=CD level. Hmmm, coincidence? Could be, but certainly interesting considering we are talking about a move of over 7000 pips!! Anyways, we make note of this and look for more confluence on smaller time frames using multiple filtering tools if/when the WW gets near point D.

Although symmetry may not be perfect, but how about the C and D leg of the WW possibly forming in GBPJPY daily being a WW itself on H4?

Yes indeed a WW on the 4H, over extended by almost 150 pips. There's a reason they call GBP/JPY The Dragon!

Hi there!  
  
Thanks for the thread, very interesting. Im trying to 'backtest' your wave theory but im not sure i got the hang of it. Would you guys have a look and tell me what you think. The circle and the target zone is **my** take, on what would have been a take profit, so in this case, according to myself, this may be a failed trade, am I right??  
  
Its the daily chart and the red trend line is all 'my work'.  
  
Thanks, best of luck

Hi Liquidsnake.  
  
A couple of things:  
  
1) The wave itself is valid but barely convergent, almost a perfect channel. I tend to stay away from these types. I like a deeper sweet zone with more convergence. The reversal point was about 200 pips beyond the AB=CD completion price.   
  
2) I generally don't target the "target" line. It's certainly a reference point but a lot can happen on the way back down. Smaller counter waves may develop which may make me inclined to book some profits early as I tend to do anyways. But price not reaching the target line for me doesn't mean it was a failed WW  
  
Cheers, -Kurt

Yen pairs can be tricky at times but thought I'd dive into this one as my first trade for the week. So far so good. Initial rejection about 5 pips short of point D, a retest and now going back up. All SLs to BE.

You have everything backwards. I would suggest starting from post one and looking thru the pdf or any other free online resources.

Really ugly wave but I can't resist the risk/reward. Previous strong S/R zone with the last line of defense 78.6FIB. Discount price to buy.   
  
Tight SL of 20 pips trying for 80. So far price has met resistance EXACTLY at AB = CD

I escaped the SL hunt by about 8 pips. Set it for 30 pips when I looked closer at the Daily support level and the previous S/R. Now we are slowly grinding higher.

Not the most beautiful wave but still a valid structure. I like the way you map out your waves making everything very clear. Great habit to follow.  
  
Viel Glück!

Yeah, in fact it closed to BE.  
  
Having good vibes for this. Nice ab cd pattern with bounce on weekly pivot.

True, not that neat of a WW, but who knows. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
Thx you for your comment, I really appreciate it. And I really feel like getting the hang of trading WW step by step thanks to reading and following this thread, especially your posts. Thanks for all the effort and patience you're putting in it.

Possible WW building in **GBPEUR H4**. It's converging only slightly and therefore the sweet zone is really small. If there's really a WW developing I could imagine the CD-leg reaching the area between 1,075x to 1,08xx testing the August 29th low. Grey areas are weekly S/R-zones.

One thing to keep an eye out for is WWs developing inside WWs. Note that there was another WW developing here that has point D at .9769 which is below your SL.   
  
So far on the second wave price stopped exactly at point D which is also the 261FIB ext.

Short of point D but beautiful symmetry. Also, 5 of the daily and weekly PIVOT/S/R levels are identical. To me that says that price is in a harmonic mode for now.

The current wave forming looks promising, but there's a preceding and bigger WW that might still wanna reach its target. What do you think about that?

Good point my friend and certainly important to keep track of any other waves in play. However, I think that wave has played out to its potential considering how much price has been ranging since that time.

Right, makes sense to me. Gotta keep that in mind for future setups. For me it's still difficult to judge how much time to give a wave to complete, but I guess it always depends on many different things that influence the equation... But it's those things that keep the game interesting, right? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

How about that: **Gold monthly**  
First to point D where the 61,8% fibo-level of the downmove from September 2011 to December 2015 confluences with horizontal resistance. Then the D-leg down towards the 200 SMA, with a target somewhere in the area between the 61,8% and 76,8% fibo of the upmove from 680 to 1.920 USD. Would be fun if it'll play out like that, I'll keep watching it.

Right!  
  
I imagine trading for me is like when I am driving my car around town. I am defensively aggressive. If I see an opportunity where I need to pump it up a bit and get in the passing lane, I will do it. BUT, I will ALWAYS be aware of my surroundings. Always on the lookout for other drivers (news events, geopolitical events, time of day, etc) that could put me in a risky situation.

Not to the target line but good enough for 60 pips. We'll take it and look for other opportunities.

Spotted a WW in H1 GBPUSD in the sweet zone. Hope this will be a fruitful one.  
  
Please correct me if I found the wrong WW hehe. It seems to be the pattern is harmonic as AB = CD.

Something I will be monitoring next week. The Kiwi has gotten every possible type of bad press over the last few weeks. It may be a little overcooked at the moment. On the sidelines for now but will evaluate price action/sentiment next week.

This is also on my chart. Let's see today's close.. If it close as a good bullish candlestick, I would get in Monday. But I am only looking for Engulfing bar, or a pin bar haha. What is your favorite candlestick pattern to enter, Kurt? :-)  
  
thanks

Well I don't really have a favorite. Guess it depends on the context in which it appears.

**AUDUSD daily**  
  
Not a CWW, but I consider going short when/if price comes back to at least the 141,4% fibo, preferably somewhat above it close to the 161,8% fibo.  
Any thoughts on that are welcome.

That's a possibility that came to my mind too and I can imagine it's a likely scenario, considering point "d" of the smaller possible WW (purple in my chart below) would be a pullback to the longer term ascending red dashed trendline. Interestingly contrarily to your chart I don't have the big spike on my chart where I mapped point A of the big blue WW. Anyway, this will be interesting to watch how it's going to unfold.

Hi all, asked Kurt about a ww on usdchf and eurnzd and how to behave if price bounce to B point, and how to manage position; and it's better to paste here the answer so probably can help many other as did to me:  
  
**" I move my SLs to BE depending on the volatility of the pair and how many pips it has moved. For a pair like EUR/NZD 9super volatile) I wouldn't likely move my stops after 15 pips in the green. **  
  
**Also, I don't know how big your profit target is but If your trading 4H/DAILY on a pair like EUR/NZD then the TPs would be 200-400 pips at least so I would assume the SLs would be fairly big as well.**  
  
**I tend to enter multiple positions and take profit on the first position if I make 20-30 pips. A lot though depends on the pair and the time frame.**  
  
**Right now their is a bearish WW on EUR/NZD that is about 80 pips past the AB=CD level. I haven't entered because there is a lot of bullish momentum and this could possibly run another 500 pips plus upwards. Point is that the legs AB and CD are about 1700 pips each!! So its relative to how I would be setting my SLs and how I would go about booking profits."**  
  
Thank you Kurt!

Out at BE. Price originally dipped but then ranged and with big news coming always best to play it safe.

This is a mistake that I do too many times, which I have to correct. Fear of loosing is one of the worst defect that I have. I have planned all for this ww but i have not been able to perform it correctly. It would have been a nice TP.

Well done.  
  
NZD/USD 4H we got a bullish outside candle followed a higher close on the next candle. Maybe we can get some momentum heading into the weekend. The US dollar has been very strong across the board all week.

At least you recognize the issue is fear. Is it possible your position size is too big?   
  
In looking at the pivots and other confluence for that trade, the SL only needed to be about 20-30 pips so I'm wondering if you may be over leveraging your trades. Otherwise, there shouldn't be any fear. As Mark Douglas always pointed out, it's imperative that we trade without fear.

My risk for every trade is 0.5%, so I think it's not for that reason. Probably is because i'm not 100% confident with my trades, but my first goal is to be ad much objective as I can.  
  
For example in the wolfe of NzdUsd i'm now worried about the GDP news of USD. But i think the solution is to let the trade go as it goes

How about this one on the Weekly for WTI? XA to BC symmetry is not quite perfect, but AB CD are within a few pips of each other, and I know my broker doesn't close out the weekly chart until Monday 2AM my time...so thinking that big bullish candle could easily turn into a big bearish wick. Thoughts??

Hi bladerogers, I have doubt this will work out as I don't really like point X. If i switch to a weekly timeframe, your point X is no significant high anymore. Furthermore I'm watching an AWW (I know we don't post them anymore, but it's unfolding neatly so far) on the weekly timeframe going it's way to the targetline for weeks. I marked the bigger wave in my chart pink and yours blue:

I won't say that there's no possibility that your wave could work, but for me it's countertrend and if it works out I doubt it has big potential.  
I hope that was helpful and I'm curious how other people see this.

Again WTI. Another Classical WW on the daily appears fine to me. I would not enter below the S/R level at 54.75 however. Take Profit probably already around the Friday close (54.19).

it's probably time to secure nzdusd: NFP news in 15 hours. All forecasts are positive for the USD so, even if the news are always uncertain, it's better to be prepared  
  
"_Nonfarm payroll day has crept up again, due at 1230 GMT_

  1.  _For October_
  2. _Bloomberg consensus expected is +313K, prior -33k for the headline_
  3. _U/e expected 4.2%, prior 4.2%_
  4. _Average hourly earnigns expected 0.2% m/m, 2.7% y/y (priors 0.5% & 2.9%)_

_Snippet from Goldman Sachs' preview of the data:_  
  
_GS estimate nonfarm payrolls +340k in October, above consensus of +310k and the 3-month average pace of +91k_

  1.  _Our forecast reflects solid underlying job growth and a sharp rebound in employment in hurricane-affected areas, as we estimate flooding and power outages reduced the level of September payrolls by approximately 180k._

_Unemployment rate forecast is 4.2%_  
_For average hourly earnings_

  1.  _increase 0.2% m/m_
  2. _2.7% y/y "_

Excellent.  
I have a favor to ask you. Could you clean your charts from all that annoying moving averages when you take screen shots?   
Only because 1) I think them don't work at all with WWs 2) It's difficult to read your charts.  
it's just a tip

Just so you know, there's also a bigger, bearisch WW running its course in EURCHF H4. It might interfere with the smaller bullish one.

Yes, you'r right. I know it but, the reasons because I took this ww are 1) the bigger one hasn't completed my standards for a ww   
2) i see a another possibile bearish ww and if the bullish ww go to target, that shoul forme 4-5 leg  
look at the chart..but it might very well be wrong

Hi EXPO33, I must say so far you are the best as i was reading this post from the beginning so far i have completed page 50. I can't say that how much importance I am giving to this post as this made my life easier and surely i traded well and profitable so far however the one I am posting, please suggest me something about it initially it was in the Green Zone i.e, the Sweet Zone however it goes or crosses it and moved up to 241.0 Fib Level, so my question is, if it still is valid for the CWW or not. Reply would be appreciated. And let me tell you this thing, this is the first time i am writing about my trade to someone as this thread makes me realize that nothing is impossible believe it or not. Once again thanks for keeping this thread alive and keep it up.  
  
Cheers.

after some tests, the biggest problem for WW trading is:  
  
You can not focus on low spread currencies cause the signal appears everywhere.  
  
Forex is a zero-sum game, if you trading sth with high [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide"), you are working for your brokers.

In my broker there are pairs with very variable spreads ( at 23 p.m sometimes in some currencies arrive to 20-30 pips, so i have to remove it momentarily)  
But i enter on any ww with my setup that i see; and i'm positive to think that in a random order the targets will be in a higher percentage than the SLs.  
Second factor in my favor is the risk/reward, that is better than 1:1, sometimes cold reach even 1:5 or higher depending on your entry and your risk.

Hi Kurt, need your help here..

only EURUSD USDJPY can remain low spreads (<**1pip** including commissions) at any broker.  
  
WW count on "successful reversal", if it not happens the risk:reward is quite low.

I don't agree with you. in that screen shot you did very late entry. You have to plan you trade first, then, when confirmed, take just the wolfe.  
I have minimum a R/R of 1:2, if not, i don't enter.  
Look for example at the big WW on NU

I decided to exit because I was already in positive with a R/R: 1:4 and that wasn't even my first target (but decided to exit for the end of the week and other factors)

Hi Everyone,  
Anyone please suggest if the current CWW is the perfect one to get into the trade or not as I am still learning this. Suggestion will be appreciated.  
Is it still a valid CWW or not as it changes from Red Candlesticks to While I mean to say after Crude Inventory Report there was a good upward movement.  
Cheers @@@

I am not a specialist in Wolf Waves, but I am quite sure that the use of Envelopes can help you in classifying Harmonic Patterns in patterns of the same order , degree, nature

Hi, acsandrei:  
can you talk about how you use Gann fans and Andrew's pitchfork to find entry level as I'm curious about this topic as well? Thx for your help!

Hi, i've read all the WW thread from the beginning, and seen some different tools for filtering waves..two of them were GGann fans and Andrew pitchfork:I down't use them to decide if to enter or not, but to find the correct moment/zone to enter on the Wolfe and to know where to put the Sl. The Gann fans have to be placed at 45° / 315° depending on the trend

Hey Wolfe Wavers!!  
  
Whether one celebrates Thanksgiving or not we all can find something to be thankful about. So I just wanted to say thank you to all of the posters here that have kept this thread alive. I have been extremely busy and haven't had much screen time lately.  
  
Just to comment on the Gann fans and/or Pitchforks. As I stated in post one, this is a group effort that hopefully inspires traders to consider new and productive ways to filter out their potential trades. There's no right or wrong way. If your filters give you an edge and you use proper risk management then you will be a successful trader. Recently I have been testing/studying Fibonacci pivots (daily, weekly, monthly). I have found them to be a pretty powerful tool when coupled divergence (especially hidden divergence, i'e. trading with the trend)  
  
Again thanks to all of the posters and please stay safe if you are travelling, especially in the US as Thanksgiving weekend is here along with the mindless insanity that we call the black Friday shopping event.  
  
Building shorts here up to 7635. I think the Aussie may be exhausted in the short term. However, I wouldn't be surprised to see a low liquidity push north to wash out any weak shorts up to the 7635 area. I would think that level might be hard to break so my bias is still short.

Hello all,  
  
So i got back into trading on Wednesday of all days. Used to trade everyday years ago. So I gift my charts set up and figured out..( unfortunately there is no more accucharts).. and started my old routine.  
  
Well Friday morning rolled around and I saw what I used to call a wolfpack..( trade within a trade within a trade. Wwwwww) on the Eur/Jpy. My personal favorite to trade. Caught a great bullish rip for a for huge gain till just before market close. Forgot how much I missed this.  
  
So I figured I would get on a forum and see if anyone traded like me nowadays and sure enough here you all are. Back then nobody really knew the virtues of proper fib usage let alone what a WW was. This thread is fantastic. Best trading thread I have ever read.  
  
Just thought I would pop in and give credit where it is most certainly due. I read every page. will follow this for sure.  
  
It's great to be back in the game again.

Target hit beautifully. Cashed out most of the position, left a bit for possible further downmove cause the big picture would suggest a final bloodbath phase in Gold, before it possibly continues its bulltrend. A really nice WW. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

I like how you expand your target area instead of horizontal line for tp. Way more forgiving, way better for positive account balance.  
Awesome

Thank you. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
In this case I did that because I couldn't be sure which point really is point C as price hit the AC-line twice. As price was getting to the target line I took a good gain off the table, which was good, as I also saw a smaller bullish WW forming in M5. I'm not trading it cause it's a countertrend move in my opinion, but I took it as a sign that it's time to get out.

Unfortunately this is not a WW. I would suggest you read post one of this thread as it explains everything necessary you need to know about Wolfe Waves.

why not just point out what you see as flaws instead of telling him to read the first post? Aren't we here to help each other understand these things? Far as I can tell that IS in fact a wolfe wave. Not perfect, but a wolfe wave none-the-less, and that's based on my own knowledge obtained from Bill Wolfe's writings. granted, a continuation pattern rather then reversal, but looks good to me and I have damn near the same pattern on my own usdjpy chart that I am trading sells on lower time frame signals now.

It's not a valid WW as points A and B are both below point X. Point X has to be between A and B pricewise.

I agree, but I do suspect most that visit this thread find value because they have read at least the first post. Thanks for elaborating knurrem. Interesting, that is not something that is made clear in the wolfe wave pdf. thanks!

If you refer to the Wolfe Wave Book linked in the first post I have to contradict as it's in the rule set on pages 6 and 7.  
  
[image]Screenshot2.png;2582941[/image]  
  
But as post 1 explains the rules and everything else to take in consideration when trading Wolfe Waves much easier and more concise in my opinion, I'd prefer to go by post 1 rather than by the book linked there. Especially for beginners. But that's just my two cents. I hope that was helpful anyway...

The bearish WW in Gold hit the lower target line too. It's really interesting to observe how price got rejected when it hit the first target line, bounced back only to get down to the second target line thereafter, where it got rejected again.

Another really nice WW that already hit it's target. This wave could have given neat gains, unfortunately I haven't seen it at the right time.

Potential WW forming, still plenty of time to get in. No need to hurry in my opinion as it surely will need time to bottom.

There are actually two bearish WW. Take a look at it, what do you think? I think this could be a great trade.  
I just took one position and set a sell order to 1.54680.

Absolutely it was helpful Knurrem, thank you for your feedback/input. It's very easy to forget/overlook some of these things, so I for one very much appreciate when flaws are explained. Right now I am seeing wolfe waves (or at least I think I am) forming across a number of EUR and also AUD and NZD pairs on higher time frames (daily/weekly). I'll post some charts and ask for feedback/opinions on them. Thanks!

Well, I won't say it's impossible that this will have success as in FX everything is possible at any time. But first of all I don't really like the position of point X as it represents no significant high/low. True there is divergence perceivable in the AO too, but all in all I don't like the symmetry of this wave. My best guess is, that price will likely reach the red area where the 50% fibo level sits around. I personally wouldn't trade this wave and I wouldn't recommend it either. The probability of success just isn't high enough for me.

Awesome, thanks knurrem. I wouldn't take the trade until I see some confirmation via RSI on the 4 hour time frame, and lower lows and highs on the 15-30 minute. I'm keeping an eye on these pairs, and also EUR pairs. It looks to me like EUR might be taking a big dump soon across a number of pairs (EUR/AUD is another)

Agree with Knurrem about point X not being ideal.  
  
However, there is actually a WW on the 4H (not that beautiful) that has just reached AB=CD to the pip! Not shown on the chart but it also coincides with the 161FIB ext. Pivot resistance, especially the monthly R1 may be significant. Could be a nice risk reward here. Maybe a very small position with 100 pip SL trying for 300-500 pips. Set and forget. GBP has a lot of momentum but may be a bit overcooked.

Already dropped 150 pips. A dream scenario. Move SL to BE and enjoy the potential ride down the mountain.

That worked out really well. As I had only one position I already cashed out after that massive hourly candle. Thx Kurt for sharing that excellent WW. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

Actually I was quoting from my GBP/NZD post which dropped 300 pips. EUR/CAD also dropped 300 pips!

Not WW related but I have already built a short position for GBP/USD based on weekly supply zone with TPs at previous daily S/R levels (yellow lines). Price pierced nicely into the supply zone and has receded since.

Great call. I was in on that too. Broke quick asking with many others but not all were affected.  
  
I'd like to be a member and post but didn't want to ruin your thread with numbers and words without the visuals. Perhaps if I post more that will happen.

So far so good, all SLs moved to BE +.  
  
At the moment, major confluence of pivot support at 8850, would like to see a break lower to TP area. Might have to bank one position later tonight depending on price action.  
  
Testing out a new profit target strategy. Kind of a conservative "fan" area, not necessarily all the way to the theoretical TP line.

My initial line was struck at .8833 This is similar if not exact to the EUR/CAD. Where the minor wave hits perfectly but the larger wave tends to take forever. If at all. Are you still short on GBP/USD?

Your TP lines are like a Gann Fib retracement support thing. Very cool. I like to scale in and out as well.

I caught a small wave on EUR/CAD from 1.5080 to1.5134 earlier then rebought at 1.5068 in hopes of the repaint of the gap left say news this morning. Then i guess the London whipsaw until tomorrows news to drop it down to a repaint of the other gap left say sub 1.500. Ultimately hit both 423.6 fib, close the gap, and hit the major WW on 4hr chart at 1.4967 minimum.  
  
Of course that's just a theory. Ha.

I booked about 120 pips on the GBP/USD on average but have closed all positions. End of the year soon so not holding much in the way of long term trades. Time to balance the books and prepare for 2018

Wolfe wave trading requires patience and conviction. Forex 101 says don't try to pick tops and bottoms. In essence, that's exactly what we are doing, at least on a localized basis. We aren't trying to predict some major shift in sentiment. We are only trying to capitalize on a temporary/localized market imbalance.  
  
Example here. Why try and step in front of a speeding train. Well, for me, because the risk/reward is much more attractive. This is an aggressive entry. Many traders would rather wait for price action confirmation before entering, and that's fine and a good habit to get into. However, on smaller time frames, you may need a bigger SL, thus decreasing your risk reward. For bigger TFs, waiting for PA confirmation doesn't cut into your risk/reward as we would be looking for much larger moves anyways.

A look at the 5MIN chart shows a classic retest. That's a good sign. Hopefully momentum will die off and price will retreat.

Made a few pips on the re-entry but stopped out at BE on remaining positions. Moving on to the next opportunity.

Been waiting patiently on this one for a while. Just pulled the trigger!

Here's the 4H chart squeezed so you can see the previous S/R with the 78.6 "line in the sand" Fibo. Am hoping for 200 pips and am willing to hold for several weeks if necessary.

USD/CAD longs are being filled now.  
  
I rarely trade oil as it's such a manipulated market but it looks like WTI CRUDE may be exhausted. Daily divergence and many times the third divergent "hump" is better than the second "hump". Hopefully it will sell off heading into the new year. That would really help the USD/CAD long trade.

Hey mate I'm just curious where you get the fibo levels after the 161? I've never seen those levels used anywhere.

Well, I was searching for fixed levels for my entries and SL which I could use for steeper WWs too. Levels 113, 127.2 and 141.4 I got from this thread, which means from you. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
Then I just thought I just add 100 to each of em and got levels 213, 227.2 and 241.4.  
As for the levels in between I already got the 161.8 level, which is commonly used.  
Then I went like this:  
161.8 - 141.4 = 20.4  
213 - 20.4 = 192.6  
  
Then I finally added the 178.6 level cause it's kinda in the middle between 161.8 and 192.6 and because the 78.6 level is also a quite common fibo level, to which I just added 100.  
  
I guess it's kinda odd, but I'm using those levels for a while now and it works quite well for me.

As long as it works that's good but they really have nothing to with the Fibonacci sequence and/or how the levels are derived. I was just curious because I never noticed them before until now.

Yeah, not really fibonacci canon, right? I just wanted some levels to use as something to hold on and it works for me more often as not.  
Mabe I should call it the "Knurrem sequence". ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)

I just looked up "Knurrem" on Wikipedia and it says, "famous Austrian forex trader that discovered a new mystical Fibonacci sequence"

The EURUSD has reversed its direction inside the sweet zone for now. Let's see how far it will drop initially and if yesterdays high will hold as a resistance if tested again. If it holds and price really keeps descending after some up and down jigsawing I can imagine this pair to probably reach the 38% fibo maybe in March. At this point the target of the WW would coincide with the 38% fibo and weekly resistance. Let's see...

Although there was another higher high yesterday, it does look good today.

Indeed. I see the 4H TL has been broken. Monthly pivot down at 1.1913 area.

Thanks for the pointer. I decided to take profit on the two positions with the worst entry. The other positions have got a really decent entry level. I plan to keep them until the target line if price doesn't tell me otherwise.

**FTSE100 H1 bearish WW**  
  
Not the most beautiful WW, but still tradeable imo.  
Upward momentum already weakened and there are divergences in the AO.  
May be that price doesn't even reach the sweet zone.

Bullish Wolfe Wave on the H8 NZDCAD. I suppose if you check H1 and H8 constantly, then you have all TimeFrames covered from H1 to MN1.  
  
How close should the B point be to the XD line, 20 pips in this case.

Hey Kurt,  
  
Recently joined and found this thread to be very interesting. Thank you very much for starting this topic and providing all the information along with everyone else who have consistently supported.  
  
I'm curious to know, since starting this thread, if you are still mainly trading Wolfe Waves (I think I read 80% of your trades are WWs) and whether this system is still consistently profitable for you?   
  
Also once someone is trading this consistently, what would the expected percentage of winning trades vs loosing trades?  
  
Thanks,  
Tim

Wow, hard to believe this really completed 100%. Amazing trade ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) I used Wolfe waves long time ago but still I love them more than Elliot waves.

Hi everyone ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
First of all, I have to thank [Expo33](https://www.forexfactory.com/expo33) for sharing the wonderful Wolfe Waves theory.  
  
I'm going to share some of my findings in order to break the silence of this useful thread. As I'm new to Wolfe Waves, the following charts may contain errors, so please send your comments to improve.  
  
First, lets take a look at the past chart of EURCAD: with 3 clear WWs on the daily chart, we had a chance of catching more than 2500 pips during 1 year.

Second chart,  
A great opportunity for going long on GBPUSD, I guess it's going to complete the other half way.  
  
2nd attachment shows a probable shark pattern as another evidence.

Hi Kurt,  
  
first of all, I would like to congratulate you for your Wolfe Waves trading model!  
  
I kindly would ask you some questions about the correct interpretation of the ParvizCWW v9.7.2 I recently installed on MT4.  
  
What are the best ratios to be pointed out (see the attached file - yellow circle in the upper right) in case of a "perfect" Wolfe Waves pattern, apart from the ideal CD/AB=100%?   
  
And what do (see in the lower left of the attached file) the ExtDepth (3,6,12,20,30,50) and ExtDeviation values represent?  
  
In your opinion, which kind of Wolfe patterns are more effective in terms of ExtDepth?   
  
Many thanks and all the best!  
  
Regards  
  
Massimo

Hi Kurt,  
  
I add also the following warning: the indicator ParvizCWW v9.7.2 often blocks the MT4 functioning, as soon as I try to install it, and, as a consequence, I must close the platform.  
  
Could you provide me any suggestion in order to solve this big problem?  
  
Anybody else got the same trouble?   
  
Many thanks!  
  
Best regards  
  
Massimo

Hi Kurt,  
  
I would like to point out you that the "parvizCWW v9.7.2.ex4" Indicator, uploaded Jun 7, 2017, blocks the MT4 functioning: it really doesn't work out on MT4!   
  
Please, could you suggest me some solution? Or any indicator updates were recently posted?  
  
It would be a shame, because it is an excellent indicator!  
  
Many thanks!

Since many days you are asking ... I had to create account for answering you.  
Indicators are working fine ... you should try on other computer or other mt4 installation,  
and read first post ten times so that you understand before downloading,  
and remember its sometimes very slow with some pairs where you need to wait one or two minutes,

Today Monday market opens and it disappeared but wave followed fibo level nicely.

Hi Sincere007,  
thank you for your post: I haven't been in this thread for weeks because I thought it were closed.  
About the indicator, I consider it malfunctioning if it sometimes needs some minutes (even 4-5) of waiting.  
I also unistalled and reinstalled MT4 in order to solve the problem, but without relevant results.  
However, now I know it, but you are right: Expo and Parviz1953 should update this excellent indicator template.  
Regarding your last post, which TDI indicator are you using?   
Many thanks again and I hope you are able to read this post quite soon ...  
All right, talk to you later.  
Kind regards

Hi Knurrem,  
  
I saw your interesting WW scenario: in addition to pivot points, do you use also some trading divergence in order to filter these patterns? If so, to which indicators do you resort to identify such divergences?  
Many thanks!  
All the best

Hi mama  
  
No, I don't use any other indicators. I also do not look for divergences, I just watch the charts regularly and if you train your eye for a while you will start to just "see" those WW.

Hi paroucia,  
  
I use parzizCWW v9.7.2.ex4, but it is not an auto-trading EA: it's an indicator to be installed on MT4, following the usual procedures.

I do not mean to rain on anyone's parade, but many of the charts being offered here as Wolfe Waves are the farthest thing from them. If the "Street Smarts" book, or a knock-off website is your only exposure to this setup, then it is very unlikely that you are trading Wolfe Waves properly. And over the long haul, your results will bear this out.

hi, alkemi (or anyone who has taken Bill Wolfe's course):  
Without revealing the course contents, can you tell me whether the course is really that different from what has been taught in this thread? Is it really worth the fee? Thanks in advance!

In my opinion WW are just part of a checklist of qualifiers taught by the Ross Beck in his "Geometric Trading Method" course he offered, I took it....Excellent course. The Beck's Emblem is the first qualifier and there are about six others to qualify if you have a trade or not.

Hey there, good morning (or evening) to all, I was absent for long time, not having time for forum. I remember a bit of you reading the lasts pages (hope you remember me too ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f604.png?v=15.1)). I will be active from now, trading only WWs with implementation of market movers technic that I used this year. I will trade only H4 D1.  
Hope this thread is not dead because it worth a lot!!

Lots of support encountered near .909, but it seems it gave way to the possible Wolfe wave forming. Seems the screenshot I was looking for went missing so here is a new one.

Oh well, those of you who were there on the 1-3-5 when it happened, may the pips be green to you. For me, my email provider upgraded the TLS and I was locked out of IMAP. Luckily he re-allowed TLS 1.1, but here I am. You people remember when you started, that saying of first visualise your money burning, then transfer it to your trading account? If that thing lets go of its grip on 0.911, that's possibly me. The trail stop EA didn't work, maybe I should request demo account again to try it out, it works in the tester. Yesterday I was hoping, today I'm wishing.

Please do read the Wolfe wave book linked to in the first post. The position would have been long, but remember the 2-4 and 1-3 should converge, so you would have been trading a megaphone, not a Wolfe wave.

Lots of resistance at .909 to 0.911. Who are we fighting? Skynet? I guess I might be back then, some time or another.

Hi Dirk!  
You're replying to a post that is three years old. There's not much action in this thread these days but since you made a new attempt maybe we can change that.

Hey look! Life. It´s Friday today. Is your real name Friday? Just kidding :-)  
I looked for something that has Wolfe in it. I didn't read the whole thread, when market is closed I'm reading the Wolfe wave book in the first post again.  
Only later did I see the OP actually did reply to that post a page or what later.  
Beautiful indicator you have there. I see some bugly indicators being used to draw lots of triangles on this thread. They're bugly because they're beautifully ugly. They're using Gartley detectors to detect Wolfe Waves, but I guess that's alright because a Gartley is a Wolfe wave with a sweet zone.  
Some wouldn't mind me putting a Fib retracement on the chart but my charts already look like a Gann cloud.  
Here I'm sitting in an Alf Nose. It's an Alf Nose because it eats cats. You see that red candle at the tip of its nostril? That's not a drip, that's I stuck in a bull trap.

The name's Ingo but pandiras is fine with me. Isn't that why we had to pick a nickname for? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
I know the feeling of being trapped, it suxx, lol. My challenge is still to perfect the timing of the entry. Don't let yourself get tempted to hunt tops and bottoms because you will get dragged in way too early. Always. Patience pays off.  
  
Here's GBPYPY on a daily and a quick thought about it. Not quite convinced if that will work out, but certainly it should move south a while.  
  
What indicator do you mean? That color stochastics? It has more of an alibi function, sometimes I just want additional confirmation at a glance.  
  
Have a nice weekend.

Yes, sir.   
  
You'll get trained to see with a little exercise. Just do it, doesn't take that much time. I tried a bunch of indicators but wasn't satisfied. You gotta trust in the skills and knowledge of somebody you most probably don't even know if you rely yourself on indicators.  
  
But everything you need is already out there. As I said I use even the stoch just to confirm that the sweetspot supposedly is in extreme condition, that's it.  
  
Mainly I use the bar-chart for the candlesticks distract from seeing the real pattern. Sometimes I switch even to line-chart to see what's really going on. You can draw Wolfe Waves on the line chart and they will work (although they look completely different if you switch the chart back to bars or candlesticks then), but they do work.  
  
To me it seems it's all kind of dynamic anyways. Adjustable. And sometimes definitely needs some adjustment. Meaning sometimes it is not the highest high or lowest low points on the chart that needs to be connected (always close-by but not always top/bottom itself , just watch and check open/close also). Every now and then there may be a weird spike through one of the lines that still is not connected to the WW.  
  
What are you using for the drawings? And how do you find them WWs?

Yeah, one by one. But I gotta admit that of course, every now and then some slip through my fingers. Lol.  
  
Some are easy to find, others are not. I got my own theories about that meanwhile. Haha.

Also by hand; the two brains better than a human brain is a blue whale brain and an elephant brain. The only computer better than a human brain is a quantum computer and they are expensive. I also find Wolfe waves by looking. Currently in my individual position I'm with a marketmaker named CM Trading; their spread is wide but I don't want to shake the chicken sty now. The only instruments with positive swap on long with CMTrading is USDJPY and USDCHF; the only instruments with positive swap on short with CMTrading is EURZAR and USDZAR, but they're so widespread that I'm not likely to trade them. I guess the spread is positive in the direction that the instrument provider wants you to trade; so Switzerland wants you to trade in such a direction that their currency doesn't become too strong too fast, etc. Now with the Dollar fright everybody jumps into the Swiss, so the USDCHF wants to short. However, you said something about patience.

Seems I survived the double bottom for now.  
Another brain better than a human brain is that of a giant squid and it seems JSE also has positive swap on short on CMTrading; JSE's not 24/5 so anything longer than H1 looks choppy. I could maybe one day experiment JSE intraday.

I currently trade on a 2007 MacBookPro. Apple doesn´t have Bootcamp drivers for 64bit Win7 and the only legal Win7 that I could buy from a retailer was 64bit. This means on the BootCamp side here´s a little SP/Diff laser light shining out of the side of the desktop replacement, which might or might not become slightly irritating as time passes. My mail is on the Mac side. Today I was calling SARS; they´re not a virus but they´re the South African revenue service. Wine on the Mac side doesn´t work perfectly either; Crossover was better but not that much better, so I didn´t buy CrossOver. Opening the Hugo´s Way demo on the Mac side in Wine I saw the sell stop was taken on the server, so I put in a trailing stop; the TS was taken out nearly immediately. Here in ZA we have a government quirk called load shedding, which should in my opinion be called bad planning, but either way it means the power is off and my MBP is going to go off in a few minutes; it´s already giving low battery alarm. I´m probably going to be away for a week or two.

Hi Vetal007!  
  
Seen it but now. Nice catch (that actually worked out perfectly) even though it is not a classical Wolfe Wave since the trendlines (as drawn) are not convergent but even divergent. Also point 5 would not reach the sweet spot  
  
You could have used line charts instead of candles and it would indeed show convergent lines - or, in my opinion even a better solution, is to adjust your point 1 to the next option to the left (see attachment). Anyhow, congratz on finding that one. Awesome.. I gotta admit I missed the train ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
Btw I joined your telegram channel but unfortunately it's just in Russian language without an option to reply.

Hi pandiras. Thank you for your answer and advice on using line charts instead of candles. Line charts are really better suited for Waves. As for the telegram channel, I will write to you in private messages, and you will be able to express your ideas/suggestions/comments about my publications in the channel

Hi guys,  
  
Maybe a stupid question ...  
When we say AB=CD,  
AB (or CD) : is it price difference between A and B only  
or is it physically distance between A an B (considering difference price and difference time) ?  
It's not clear in my mind LOL

I might not be answering your question directly but imo it's the gradient. The AB=CD is a pattern that fits in with 12=34 in Wolfe waves, so the OP brought it in.

Hi guys! I don't know is this thread is still active. I started trading a Wolfe Wave only strategy on intraday (5mn) timeframe and to be honest, i'm mostly looking for confirmations that this works! I trust in it but literally didn't saw anyone who made sustainable profit from it, so I came here, hoping I would find in this thread someone who did it to prove me that I'm following the right path

Hi All. I've used Wolfe waves on and off in the past but have recently been looking at turning points at the 1.113 & 1.272 Fib levels and at the other end .113 & .272 levels. I've found that very often price will turn and/or stop and reverse again at the level at the other end. I've put a Fib across the last Wolfe Wave on GBUSD M30 chart as an example:-

I ran the fib from WW point 2 to WW point 3. As you can see, point 5 showed very strong up volume just above fib .113 and reversed, again with very strong volume, at 1.272  
I hope someone finds this useful. I've found that those fib levels are often at turning points.  
  
Thanks.  
  
Mike
