Hello Everyone:  
  
<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /><o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)> </o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)>  
  
Welcome to a new week of trading. I am starting this post in a new thread so everybody doesn’t have to go through the whole previous thread along with the fact that I am making some important updates to my EA Flyer! which will be easier to understand without reading through the last thread for all the little details.  
  
<o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)> </o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)>  
  
Last week was again a week of trading not for the meek. We saw the EUR/USD up and down the whole week finishing up with a 75 point drop Friday from the early part of the day. My personal trading did well for the week up until Friday, then took some hits thanks to news. I hope Friday the 13<SUP>th</SUP> was not as unlucky for everybody. But I digress.

As for my EA Flyer! this last week, I have to admit my results and data are extremely skewed and I am unable to give any accurate results because I am in the middle of moving from one household to another and I have not been able to have my computer running consistently because I’m staying in a hotel temporarily. Hopefully, this week I can have some more consistent tests as I won’t be moving around so much. However, during this last week I did see some good trades and some bad trades. In going over the statistics and examining the data available, I have noticed that since the beginning of October we have started a different sort of pattern on the market than what has been seen for the last several months. Back testing Flyer all the way up through Friday shows very consistent results until October which then begins to take several losses. I’m sure all of you have found Flyer! taking some losses this last week along with some gains. I am hoping that each of you are finding some settings that are working out better for you. It’s all part of the process of understanding the markets. During my research, I am discovering all kinds of little hidden pieces of information that I hadn’t really realized before.

Anyway, a lot of people are concerned that Flyer! is not exiting the trades early enough to prevent a drain of profit when the position reverses and starts going back up. I understand everyone’s concern with this as I too have seen that particular issue arise. This is the problem with a quick ranging market. I have an answer to the problem. I will be releasing a “FLYER! - VERSION B” along with an updated original version hopefully within the next 24 hours. Version B uses a different exit strategy while keeping the original entry conditions. B so far in tests performs quite nicely in a ranging market and has a slightly better win/loss ratio. However, the drawback is that it will not capture the huge gains that A will when the market begins a nice long trend. But the advantage is that on quicker moves with larger rebounds, it will exit very close to the bottom/top of the move and not allow the profit to drain away in the rebound. It will be up to you which version you choose to use, but read on because I have made an interesting discovery with version A.

For those of you currently testing Flyer!, I have done some further research and now have found some settings for “TimePeriod” = 15 which actually give better results than those using “TimePeriod” = 30. On the EUR/USD in a comparison back test between the 15 and 30 settings starting on Feb. 1, 2006 to present, I achieved a 98.5% win ratio (Can we hope for any better???!!!) on the 15 minute setting out of 396 trades. This resulted in a $10000 account turned into $4 million with equity management feature in use. Compare this to the 94% and $2.5 million on the 30 minute setting. The 15 minute setting also makes it through these last couple of weeks of October without the huge losses seen on the 30 minute settings, although it still has a couple in there.

Attached to this post is a Word Document that shows a table of results comparing the original version (Version A) and the upcoming (Version B). I have yet to test the possibilities on any of the other pairs yet, only the EUR/USD. It takes several hours to run complete back tests using all the CPU power on my laptop (and it’s a good Laptop, too!).  
  
<o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)> </o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)>  
  
Some comments on the results:

For version A, I added an additional line for the 15 minute setting that had results close to the other “best” setting, but had a smaller stop loss setting.  
  
<o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)> </o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)>  
  
You see quite a difference between version A & B. Both versions do not do good on the 60 minute settings. A is really good on both the 15 and 30 minute settings, while B is only good on the 30 minute setting. I think the reason B does as well as it does on the 30 minute setting is that on this timeframe the exit points for both versions are closer to being the same values due to the way the dynamics of the market perform whereas on the other time frames, it is not so.

For now, I think you all have some things to digest and I have written enough for this post now. Have a good week of trading and thanks again for testing, helping, and using my EA, Flyer!

I will be letting loose the updated version shortly which fixes some bugs and a few minor tweaks....  
  
However, to test the current version 1.04 for the 15 minute setting on the EUR/USD use:  
  
TimePeriod = 15, S/L = 75, T/S = 65, Point Adjust = 0.0001.  
  
\-----------  
Note: Using the 15 minute period will create a lot more trades each day than the 30 minute period.

Here is most recent version of my original release of Flyer! which I have now called Version A, or release 1.05A.  
  
There are no major differences between 1.05A and 1.04. I have only made minor changes to the documentation from 1.04 as I see no real need yet for anything else.  
  
I have only made a few minor changes to the EA to fix some bugs, mainly with the problem everyone has had with error #131 showing up.  
  
The default settings are now changed, though. It now runs using the 15 Minute internal timeframe rather than the 30 minute as I have found it gives better results at least on the EUR/USD. Other pairs are untested so far.  
  
Enjoy!

Hi Everyone:  
  
Here is Version B of Flyer! now. This one is more stable in ranging markets and takes more immediate profits after completing a trend in the short term range. However, it does not take the large amount of profits that the original version does.  
  
This version uses a different exit strategy. Rather than waiting for the 5 WMA to cross over the EMA 28, it now exits when the WMA 8 crosses the SMA 10. I have found this to be optimal for catching most of the profit after the trend completes its initial move.  
  
In the below picture, you can see an example trade on the GBP/USD where it exited. Notice if this was version A, it would have rebounded much further before exiting, thus losing more of the profit.  
  
I hope this version helps for those people who prefer the EA to take its profits a little quicker rather than waiting out to see if the trend will go further.  
  
Good luck everyone!

All tests with Strategy Tester have to use the M1 setting  
  
Any other setting gives you erroneous results.  
  
PointAdjust can be negative or positive.... for Eur/Usd.... negative is appropriate.

Make sure you have all your price history back that far on both the 1 minute charts and the 15 or 30 minute depending on what you have TimePeriod set to. If not, it won't trade during the portions you are missing history.

That made a huge huge difforence. It is very important to DL those files for anyone who is doing a little back testing on this EA. Pick them up here for the pairs.

Chad,  
  
It's easier if you tell me what your parameters are including your settings on Strategy Tester. From that I can tell you what you need to correct.

Chad,  
  
I don't see any problems with your settings. I ran GBP/USD for 08/01/06 thru present with the same values and showed a 54,000 profit.  
  
Typically when I see somebody unable to duplicate the results it is usually something to do with the data set or the strategy tester settings. It has to be run on the M1 setting. No other setting will work properly.  
  
If you are unable to resolve it, please send me via PM a copy of the strategy tester report. I would be interested to see what is going on.

GirlFlyer,  
When you say run the M1 setting, you really mean the "Model every tick" setting right? Because there is a Period setting as well.   
  
I assume the Period setting should be set to the Time Frame value in your table of results, for example, M15 time frame, correct?  
Thanks,  
jdl

JDL and everybody,  
  
I don't want this to sound bad, but I cannot help but to get a little bit ticked off. I've been doing a lot of hard work and research in putting this EA together and felt like I would like to share it with people to give them an opportunity to benefit as well. However, when I repeat things over and over over and over.... and have it fully documented, it becomes apparent people are not taking the time to sit down, read, and do their own research. I do not know how many times I have to tell everyone that Flyer! can only be back tested using the M1 setting in Strategy Tester. This means what it means... you DON'T test it on the M5, or M15, or M30, H1, H4, D1, W1, etc... etc. etc... This is the last time I am going to explain this on the threads as I am getting tired of repeating myself and tired of people not doing their own research to understand. If anybody else asks me this from now on, I am referring them to this post.  
  
The design of the EA is such that it relies on precision entry/exit points to be profitable. This can only be achieved on the back tests using the M1 setting because that is as close to the Tick By Tick execution that live trading gives you. Strategy tester on any other setting than M1 and "Every Tick", no matter how good your database is, will approximate the bid/ask prices during the intervals giving false price action. Thereby, creating non realistic trading conditions. That is why the EA fails to operate on those higher time frames during back testing. However, during live trading, the story is different. During live trading, each tick of data that comes in over the live feed causes the EA to execute no matter what Chart Time Frame it is attached to. This is why during live trading you can run Flyer! on any Chart you wish, because it does all of its calculations internally independent of the Chart Time according to the "TimePeriod" you have set.  
  
Ok, I've ranted enough now. Please people, I love helping out and offering my knowledge and research, but take the time to do your own research in addition to that of others. You'll understand everything much better and maybe learn something.

Good for you - it must be incredibly frustrating to put forth the effort you obviously have invested in this EA and then have the identical questions asked over and over (not to mention the "how do I put an EA on my chart" questions).  
  
Show a bit of courtesy and appreciation, good people and RTFM!

Hi Marci and gang, i have a question for the group on two trades that took place this morning at 18:00MT4 time on the IBFX demo feed. Below is a screen shot of two trades that were taken by the B version that i'm a bit confused about. On the chart are the appropriate MAs, from 5(linear)wma in green, 8(linear)wma in yellow, 10sma in red and the EMA tunnel in the blues. As you can see trades were entered without the appropriate Green/Yellow (5/8mas) moving through the tunnel. If you look at the price, price did in fact go beyond the tunnel in the direction of the trades taken, but this is not what was supposed to happen, correct? I've double checked the visually placed MAs and they are correct as i understand the model/EA from the original version B document. The only issue might be that MT4 does lable the only MA with "weighted" as a "linear weighted". Other than that all should be well.  
  
Any thoughts assistance is appreciated. I like the idea of multiple MA-EAs and this one shows promise.  
  
Cheers,  
Thom  
  
_PS, Marci: as to your post #30? You go girl. You've done a great job keeping a level head, don't let a few spoil your fun. Hang in there : )_

Lou and GirlFlyer,  
I apologize for my dumb question. I am simply trying to recreate this EAs great results as a way to learn the Strategy Tester. I have already read all 250+ messages in this and the earlier thread.  
  
Even after importing the historical data and running EUR/USD on M1 and every tick, I get results far different than those postedin the Word doc.  
  
I know it must be something in my settings, I'm just trying to pinpoint what that is. It sounds from other postings that I'm not the only one who has had trouble with this.  
  
Here is some output from the report testing 1.05 Version A:  
<table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="820"> <tbody><tr align="left"><td colspan="2">Symbol</td><td colspan="4">EURUSDm (Euro vs US Dollar)</td></tr> <tr align="left"><td colspan="2">Period</td><td colspan="4">1 Minute (M1) 2006.02.01 00:00 - 2006.10.13 00:00 (2006.02.01 - 2006.10.13)</td></tr> <tr align="left"><td colspan="2">Model</td><td colspan="4">Every tick (based on all available least timeframes with fractal interpolation of every tick)</td></tr> <tr align="left"><td colspan="2">Parameters</td><td colspan="4">LotPercentage=8; MinVal=5000; StopLossVal=75; TimePeriod=15; PointAdjust=0.0001; TrailingStopLevel=65; BrokerMinLotSize=0.1; FixedLots=0; MyLotSize=1; LotValue=0; MarginVal=100; </td></tr> <tr align="left"><td colspan="2">

JDL,  
  
Judging from the output of your strategy tester, it doesn't look like you have the full range of history in your computer. Go in to both your 1 minute chart and your 15 minute chart on your screen and make sure you can manually scroll the screen back to the beginning of the time frame tested. Chances are you cannot on one or both of your charts. If you cannot, you must import the history for these charts into MT4 in order to complete it before you can duplicate the results.  
  
BTW, MT4 is very picky about its history files. You may have to delete the current ones, import your data, and then restart MT4 in order to get it to work right.  
  
Also, I'm sorry I had to vent earlier. I don't mind questions, I just don't like repeating myself. But thanks for trying everything out.

Accrete,  
  
Just curious what you have your point adjust setting at? Each of the trades look like they occured right after a point in which the WMA's got close to crossing the tunnel. In first looking at it, it makes me think the Point Adjust setting might be inadvertently set to 0.01 instead of 0.0001 or thereabouts. If that happened, it could very easily do this. Beyond that, without further research, I'm not sure what could be the answer. MT4's Linear Weighted MA is the right one. I just use WMA in my documentation.  
  
If you have the correct Point Adjust, please write me with your settings then and I will look at it.

Accrete,  
  
I looked at these examples a little closer. I think I may know what happened. If your Point Adjust is set to -0.0002 (or less), that would cause it to trade at that point. The MA's in this case are so close together (only 3 pip spread diff), that with the point adjust at that level, it would cause the EA to trade.  
  
Its an obvious false signal that unfortunately got caught.

Hi Marci,  
  
When backtesting what time frame do you use? Noooooooo! Just JOKING!  
  
Just want to say having the entry and exit points joined by a dotted line is a nice touch. Haven't seen that anywhere else. It is so quick and easy to review the action.  
  
Thank you so much for everything!

Hi everyone,  
  
I'm attaching a file to this post that contains all the relevant optimum settings for all the currency pairs I have tested. It also shows the results achieved on back tests for those settings.  
  
I hope this helps everyone out.  
  
GirlFlyer  
  
P.S. I hope tomorrow I can get the same out for Version B.

Marci,  
  
this is the strategy tester report from 2 server Interbank and Strategybuilderfx.

i think i'm just too new to your EA, am i missing something in the first place?  
  
and also,  
  
i hope u can answer me this time, if i'm gonna run it on a mini account, what are the configurations ?  
  
thank you,  
  
Chad

Hi, Marci  
  
Can you explain what the point adjustment does?

I am going to try to make up for my question earlier about historical data. Here is what i think you are looking for:  
  
  
_A positive or negative value that adjusts the decision process to enter a trade. Must be in increments of the currency pair being traded. i.e., EUR/USD = 0.0001, USD/JPY = 0.01, etc. Note: This factor is very sensitive and should not be adjusted very far from the suggested values._  
  
  
  
  
That is from the Doc.  
  
You are telling the EA what place value is equal to 1 pip. In the EUR/USD- 1 pip looks like 0.0001. In the USD/JPY- 1 pip looks like 0.01.  
  
Im guessing if you increase it by 1 pip(0.0002), it creates sort of like a buffer zone? Maybe price must go up 1 more pip or down one more pip to give u the signal? Also does it being positive or negitive make this difforence;if it is negitive, a signal is taken 1 pip earlier? Taking a stab at the adjustment there.  
  
Lookin out for you Macri! Keepin the blood pressure down ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Hi Marci and all.   
  
Let me say this about my enthusiasm for this MAcross EA. As it is based on a manually tradable model, and one that is quite logical, i find it is a good fit because i would trade this way manually. All the more reason to dig into this one and see it's success for all.  
  
As for my post above, and your kind replies; I have the point values set to those suggested in the original .doc files for both EAs (.0002/.02Jpy vB, .0001/.01Jpy). So if the point value creates a situation where there is more "play" i'll maybe go to zero?? I don't think i want it taking trades unless the lines really cross over for sure. I've just downloaded the new settings .doc and will make the according changes to vA.  
  
There is an ea over at FXTSD that is using what NewDigital calls a "Delta", basicaly what it does is there is a user set filter off the primary MA of XX number of +/-pips. I don't know if this might help to eleminate some of these situations (i came home at there were two trades on vA that had similar close, but no actual cross entries). Anyway, I'm going to paste in the line of code here from the other MA, i'm not trying to "fix" anything that might not be broken, i'm just here to see Flyer work into what you've envisioned. My apologies if this post of possible additional code idea is inappropriate, just trying to help.  
  
extern int Delta1=0;  
  
\-----the above lets the user set how many pips +/- from the main MA that acts as a filter for entering trades. The MAs must actually exit this channel (think of this as the "Levels" setting when placing an MA on a chart. Same idea)  
  
if (  
(Buy1_1 < Buy1_3+(Delta1*Point) && Buy2_1 >= Buy2_3+(Delta1*Point))  
  
\------So the above is looking at the Main Ma + the "Delta" filter before the trade will be taken.  
  
double Buy1_1 = iMA(NULL, 0, SignalEMA_Period, 0, MODE_EMA, PRICE_CLOSE, Current + 1);  
double Buy1_2 = iMA(NULL, 0, CloseEMA_Period, 0, MODE_EMA, PRICE_CLOSE, Current + 1);  
double Buy1_3 = iMA(NULL, 0, MainEMA_Period, 0, MODE_EMA, PRICE_CLOSE, Current + 1);  
  
\------The above is just the details of what the different MAs are doing.   
  
  
Good trading to all,  
Thom

Hi Chad,  
  
I figured out your problem....  
  
I should have realized, but I'm not used to working with two different versions yet. The reports you show me are from version B. All the settings I have published so far, are for version A. Version B does not work well on the 15 minute time period, only on the 30 minute time period. I will be posting some settings for version B today. In the meantime, if you look in my old thread "Help test my new EA, Flyer!", you can find version 1.04 in there. The settings it has in the documentation will still be fairly accurate for use in Version B.  
  
Also, you still have some gaps in your data history. If you have 100% of your data in your charts, you will get a modelling quality of 25%. 25% is the maximum value possible. If you're missing data, it will go below 25%. In looking at the trades, there seems to be a gap around 8/11 to 8/23. Check that out. You must make sure you can manually scroll on your screen through the entire history to be tested for your data set to be accurate.  
  
Hope all this helps  
  
Marci

Hi Again,  
  
I think I'm going to answer your post and Liquid11's all in one post. First, I don't mind people making changes to the code for their own usage. That's what its here for. Second, as to the Point Adjustment. The point adjustment feature allows the EA to jump in a trade early or late depending on how close everything is to crossing. (There is one other setting that has some affect on the entry price which I will discuss further down). I have also found this factor is very sensitive for the profit factors. Some currency pairs have better performance with significantly different values. Btw, I've tested these pairs on various values ranging from either -0.0003 to 0.0003 or -0.03 to 0.03 and the ones I have given are statistically what seem to give the best profit results over time. However, this value (the Point Adjustment) must be balanced with the Stop Loss Value and the Trailing Stop Value. For instance, I found a more profitable setting for the Eur/Usd using different values with the point adjustment set to .0001 instead of -0.0001. However the Stop Loss value was over 75. On a 15 minute timeframe, I felt a stop loss over 75 was a bit excessive so I went with the lower Stop Loss.  
  
Additionally, the Trailing/Stop value also helps determine the entry price. The EA takes 25% of the Trailing/Stop value and compares that amount with the difference between the actual price of the pair vs. the value the MA's at cross. If the difference exceeds 25% of the T/S, it doesn't trade because the the price has moved too far too fast. (Prevents news announcements from causing trades!!!!!) I will probably add a new variable in future versions to separate this function so as to have more control and less interdependency.  
  
Finally, Accrete... a word about the situation that occured last night for you. This situation seems to be very rare. This is the first time I've seen it. For this to happen, essentially the price movement on a pair has to be almost zero for an extended period of time for all 4 MA's to be within 2 or 3 pips of each other all at the same time. Yes, changing the point adjustment to 0 will eliminate this problem. However, you statistically over time change your profit margins. Run a few strategy testers with various values in the point adjustment and see the difference. It's quite amazing how much difference 1 pip on your entry price can do.  
  
Your Delta filter seems interesting, but I'm curious to wonder how well it will work over time and how wide the tunnel is that it creates. If the tunnel is too wide, more than 4 pips top to bottom with the centerline at the point of cross over, I doubt you will get good results if it forces the trade to occur only once it is outside of that tunnel. Anyway, feel free to test it, and let me know if you get any success.  
  
Liquid11,  
  
I hope this answers most of your question on the Point Adjustment. Essentially what you said in your post is correct. Negative values allow the signal to become valid earlier while Positive Values force it to become valid later. So, yes! you got it and thanks for examining it in detail first before just jumping in with the questions. This is the kind of situation I feel most inclined to answer!  
  
Happy Trading to All!

I am currently testing Version A with a 50,000 demo account using all the settings from the document. Some pairs have large profits, but I do not see the TS adjusting itself to protect the gains thus far. For the EAs, MinVal was left at 5000. If the SL is ever hit for all the profitable trades, all would be at a loss.... I will let the EA run to see how it does without my intervention.

ET, The T/S doesn't kick in until the profit exceeds in pips the value you set for the Trailing Stop. Hope that helps you understand.

Thanks for explaining it. If the profit is never reached prior to kicking in, don't you feel that it is risky in losing all those gains? I am not sure if you will find many trading like this live since one want to at least break even - I know there pros and cons to it.  
  
Keep up the good work....

ET,  
  
That's why I started version B. It will take profits at the top/bottom of the curve. Drawback is if the trend is not done and takes off again, it will not catch the whole thing. Your choice.

Hi Everyone!  
  
******** Correction Everyone ***** Everything inside these asterisks is a correction to the earlier message. Had an error in this post earlier... I had an incorrect setting on the usd/jpy and the eur/jpy (%equity was wrong) and falsely gave higher than normal profit readings.  
  
I've corrected the settings file to reflect the true 8% equity I have been testing with all along.  
  
Sorry, Eur/Jpy is not truly more profitable on Version B as I originally thought.  
  
The file in this message is changed from earlier.  
  
*****************************************  
  
  
As promised, here are the settings and test results for Version B. Some interesting findings with Version B. *** Part of original message deleted here ****   
  
PLEASE, PLEASE remember that the settings for Version A do not match those with Version B. Version A works better on the 15 minute period whereas generally, Version B works better on the 30 minute period. I say generally because the AUD/USD is an exception. It works on Version B better with the 15 minute period.  
  
Anyway, see the the attached file for the settings, results, and comments.  
  
Good luck to everyone and I'm glad to see everybody seems to be overall getting some good results.

May I sugest breaking this thread into two ... one for each version to avoid confusion.  
  
May turn out to be easier to track the two variants of this EA?

Kenari, It should work fine with IBFX. I use them on my demo. Make sure all your parameters are correct, especially the minimum lot size.

I have to ask the silly question. Are you seeing the kb signal at the bottom right of the screen or are you not getting the smiley at top right of chart window?

????  
  
On Flyer version A running on Multibank MT4 platform it opened a GBP long trade at 18633..it has printed a TP figure of 19333 in the open position window.  
  
Pardon the ignorance but should the trade not be closed by TS?

The trade will be closed by either of two ways, #1 is when the exit conditions are met by the MA's crossing, or #2 by the S/L. The S/L is adjusted upwards by the T/S routine as the profit increases.  
  
As for the TP figure, when the T/S routine adjusts the the S/L, it also has to put a value in the trade for the TP level. I had it set the value extremely high so that the true exit conditions would close the trade. Now if you get lucky and the value of the currency shoots up 600 points in a few minutes, you'll get an extremely large profit!!!!! (ha ha)  
  
Hope that helps!

If you don't mind me asking, what percentage of equity are you using? It looks like you have a real high setting. If so, there is a good chance you'll blow out your demo account before you have a chance to really test it.

Make sure your history on the 15 or 30 minute charts is in your computer. Not just the 1 minute charts. It needs all of them in order to work.

This is my settings screenshot..since its not make my trading loss from yesterday..Im quite confident that today it would generate profit again to my account..so I dont change it till now.Maybe u need to improve somemore at ur code to recognise the market movement precisely.Anyway Im glad to test ur EA as on my opinion someday it would be 90% accurate to enter or exit the market especially for its favourite currency like GU,GJ,EG or any other currencies..TQ

GirlFlyer,  
  
Have you tested your Flyers with different MaxBars values in the CheckToOpenBuy and CheckToOpenSell functions? I see it is set to 5, which I think means the initial crossover has to totally occur within 5 time periods.   
  
Have you found 5 to be optimal? Have you seen a downside to setting that higher? I see a trade today that would have occurred except the MAs intermingled for about 8 periods before the crossover fully completed. Would that indicate a weak crossover and thus no trade is opened?  
  
Thanks,  
jdl

Yes, I have tried changing the values... 5 turned out to be about the best.

You can use both versions in the same demo account, but not on the same currency pair. I plan on fixing this problem on the next release, as I already realized there would be a conflict there.

Consumer,  
  
25% is the maximum you can achieve using the M1 chart settings by the nature of the formula used to calculate that figure. This is proven by the documentation on the MT4 website (<http://articles.mql4.com/93> ). Otherwise, the info about higher modelling quality is good.

Consumer,  
  
I'm not one to say anything generally, but you can't expect to get accurate results on a long term basis with the equity at 50%. One or two wrong trades and your account will be down to nothing in a hurry.

GirlFlyer,  
  
In the Version A, USDJPY, had initiated an order today, but the top left hand corner does not display "1 Open Order, Equity=.....". On other currency pairs, I do not have that problem.

It doesn't seem to be consistent, now it appears while others it disappears... no matter since that is not important....

I just checked this thread out for the first time and was wondering if anyone has done some substantial forward testing.   
  
I ask this as I am not a fan of backtesting. I've seen some EA's score 90% and over on backtests only to fail miserably in real life.  
  
Does anyone have some forward testing results?  
  
Thanks,

hey bago, good buddy! Im sure you remember our great debate, if you dont mind me calling 'it' that. Everything aside from that, Im doing a little forward testing. MoneyMaster has done a little more than me as noted in the past posts but as of right now, only 24 hours i have had 1 bad trade(the first trade). I do have a lot open(4), but as of right now they are all negitive but by only a few pips, the highest is -18 but thats cable the rest are -8 and lower. Il post back in a few days with something. As of right now, these results i have posted are to be taken very very lightly. Id almost admit not to take these seriously. Im just posting whats on my screen! Im using Version B with Version B recommended settings. Check back in a few days, or by the end of the week next week, and il post what has happened so far.

I am forward testing Version A, it seems pretty good not until the Asian Session last night which all are floating in negative territory. I wanted to test Version B also, but I do not know how to open another MT Session since it will not open another window.....

Bago welcome to my thread,  
  
Long term back testing and by logical reasoning says Version A should be more profitable than Version B. But B should do better in tight ranging markets... I'm working on the forward testing and I've had decent results so far. Some bad trades too, of course. I'm having consistency issues with my forward testing right now because of internet and software problems which are disrupting the flow of tests. But I can say that Cable seems to be the most profitable and most accurate pair. Of the 2 weeks I've been running this, I've taken 3 losses vs 8 wins on Version A.  
  
I will try to post a full results over the weekend. I also encourage those who are testing to do the same, because I also believe that starting times of EA's which can be different will also affect results.

I admire your energy, commitment and intelligence.   
From now I also started to test Flyer(A), attached it to the chart, but have to check something in the code, before making any comments.  
  
Good day

I echo the positive sentiments expressed above and elsewhere. Thanks GF.  
  
I am currently running B with 7 of 8 possible trades now open. Showing 10 pips profit overall caused by an open loss on A for cable of 42 pips. A current total of 8 trades open. GBPUSD is the only one running on A.  
  
I'll post final results over the weekend.

I just wanted to tell everyone thank you for the positive compliments with regards to my EA. I appreciate that you are trying things out and liking the results and recognize the time involved with developing such a project. I really believe it is helpful to get as many people involved as possible because more variations and ideas arise from such. If I were doing this by myself being greedy perhaps in the forethought of "Hey if this is successful, shouldn't I keep it to myself...", I don't think we would be accomplishing as much as we are.  
  
Again, Thank you!

Consumer,  
  
Version B (the one you are using) doesn't perform very well on the 15 minute period. The correct 30 minute period will slow down the multiple trades you are getting. It looks like you are using the settings from Version A. Look at post #58. It has all the settings for Version B.

Hi,  
  
I just read your thread for the first time and it sounds great. I love how everyone is so helpful to each other. Would love to learn more about this EA idea as i'm not sure if you created it as yet to test. I have been testing some others with varying levels of success and wondered what you were working with and how i could contribute to this group. So if i can get an idea of what this is about or the EA i would love to digest it and send back all i know. I usually only like to send what seems successful and doing that kind of testing now via Interbankfx version 4. So please let me know appreciate the fellowship here.

Ok I already changed my setting to TF30..so I will post the result on tomorrow..as for now I've found something that could give more controls to EA as this EA features it claims to have resistance on different market situation even it may automatically change the setting base on market trend,maybe u can take a look at it..this is opensource version as the commercially it worth $500..use at ur own risk..TQ

Chad, I'm not sure who or what you are referring to. For 2 days, 8 trades is really not that bad. I average about 1 or 2 per pair each day, but mostly only 1. It also depends on when you started the EA. If you got in just after a valid signal, another may not come along for awhile.

Hey i kinda like this EA.  
  
Trying it out on some pairs (demo) will let you know how it turns out.

c1ro, it may help if you take a look at flyer! backtest charts that GirlFlyer posted early in thread and look at the profitability column or any other column that you would determine as a benchmark by which to base a most successful pair. They will all move differently yeilding varying results over months even years of tests. News varies, sentiment varies and right now we just have the backtests to base _anything_ on until we forward test for several months in demo. I for one took the Aud due to the accuracy result and am just running that one on forward test. You could just place all pairs in forward test if you want and analyze after 60-90 days and pick the best performers. TTYL, Kevin

Anyway, thanks for ur kindness. I dont know how this EA works actually. I have never known anyone and I myself never taken this kind of thing. So, I am so clueless. I heard that EA can work by itself after u manage first. But I wanna know, if it can help me just the alerts but not the execution.   
  
Thanks!!

In the old thread somebody posted an indicator - that will fulfill your requirements. Searching Flyer ind should find it.

Hi Everyone,  
  
During the forward testing of Flyer, especially in the last couple of weeks, I am seeing several "false" signals appearing where the MA's only cross for a short while during slow periods and consequently the trades end up going the wrong way on us. EUR/USD in my opinion since it is the highest volume currency out there, trades with a higher degree of volatility which may create these false signals more often. In back testing Flyer!, I have noticed these false signals don't seem to occur as often as they do in the live trading. I am working on examining the cause of such, but I would like to ask if people are experiencing this as well. If you are, my suggestion is to raise the "Point Adjust" factor on the EUR/USD up a couple of points. This will help filter some of these false signals out and give the EA an idea of where the currency really is headed.  
  
Happy Trading to All!

I have many floating trades for Version A which is on the wrong side right now with the recommended configuration in the document from this thread. Do you think this EA should maybe have some timeframe as to when it should run for certain currency pairs?

I'm not quite sure if you do this already, but what you may want to try is to test the signals across multiple time periods. For example, testing current period - 1, current period, and current period + 1. ie. test if the signal is valid on 5M, 15M and 30M periods. If all three line up then it's is treated as a valid signal and only then you initiate the order. Usually you will find that the shorter periods cross first.  
  
Also, usually the cable is treated as a more volatile currency, the euro is quite subdued compared to the cable.<o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)></o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)>

I'm in the same situation as you ET. I've been examining the time angle, also. I have noticed that a lot of the times, the major trend changes come in the latter part of the Asian session to the early European and of course up in to NY. What is hurting the EA right now, is that it gets in often on the wrong side of the trend in the late NY early Asian session when often things are doing temporary retraces or the market is generally flat. I am working on resolving the flat market issue with some back tests on a new addition to the EA. So far, the back tests look promising. I just ran a back test on the EUR/USD with this feature added and got a 98.92% success rate out of 554 trades. I don't know how I can get a back test any better than that on accuracy. But the true test will be to see if it can follow thru on the live trading side.  
  
Good luck!

You're quite right on all your points. Currently Flyer! does not do multiple timeframes, but may be an addition at a later point.  
  
As for the volatility... I admit that GBP/USD is the most volatile pair (except for maybe GBP/JPY). But the strange thing about the GBP/USD is that once it gets started going on a trend, it doesn't jump back and forth over the MA lines very easy. It likes to stick to one side or the other. Consequently, I think this the one reason why Flyer! is doing so well with GBP/USD. My forward testing is going great with this pair, whereas with the Eur/usd crossing back and forth, its getting killed right now on my forward tests. Strange thing is, the E/U did not start doing this until very recent because during the back tests, it did fine up until October where it has started having an accuracy reduction there, too. It is apparent we are having a change in the patterns generated by the E/U this month which is hurting the performance of the EA.  
  
Anyhow, thank you for your input and hope to see you around more.

If not from the EU movement to the wrong side..Im sure that this account locked me in profit of $3019.54 instead of -$2196 of loss and -$1724 of floating loss..till now no new trade has been made by Flyer-v100B

GJ and EU is right..the only thing that I didn't put enough on SL..I recommended to be running on TF30 GJ should SL at 80 and EU at 60 in case below is the result from Flyer-v100B enter the market just before the retracement happen and hit SL.The only things now it didn' happen for USD/CAD which bought at 1.1401 touched SL at 1.1357 but it then still down till now.

I only went with the S/L as specified in the docs posted here since they are reasonable in real life trading. I am not sure if one can stomach such a larger S/L since we can never predict the future of price movement. Like many other EAs, they have larger S/L to rake in the PIPs, but in reality, can one stomach that type of loss in one's account? Not unless you have money to give away....

I agree with you ET, plus, I have tried bigger S/L's in the backtesting, and after a point, it no longer becomes beneficial to use bigger S/L's. It only hurts the drawdown and the number of trades, thereby reducing your profitability.

Today was Flyer!'s first not-so-good day: down **-2.764.11.**   
  
Trades opened on the other side of the trend and and just went haywire. For example, cable, E/U, A/U $528, $572 and $650, respectively and each in the red. Each pair based on recommended settings.

Marci,  
  
Thanks, for all you have done. I'm thrilled with the Flyer and the entry points it is generating. I like to monitor my trades and use my own exit strategies to close the trades. I am not sure they can be coded into a EA because I look at a different timeframe chart and use candles and other indcators for different exit strategies.  
  
However, can you tell me why the positons in the attached 2 charts were closed?  
  
Thanks, again.

Hi There,  
  
These 2 trades exited when they did because after the initial open, the trade went the opposite direction shortly thereafter. Technically the EA met its "exit" condition. However, at first it was on a negative profit, so it didn't exit right away. But, when the price spiked enough or moved enough to create a postive profit and the exit condition was still valid (ie. the WMA5 was still on the opposite side of the EMA28, it jumped out. This is a perfectly valid condition programmed that way in case of reversal of trend with a temporary spike bringing it back above the take profit mark.

Same happened with me... we all got caught in trend reversals...  
  
Unfortunate circumstances.

Here too. My vB is down $2095, though the vA is only down $894 since this week's market open. But then my FB tests took a beating today also. . . though my simple MA cross over that has been taking a beating for the first part of the week is now shinning brightly.

hey i am running ver A on GBP/JPY and it will not open a trade due to an error code of 134..  
yet it opened a nice usd/chf trade this morning with currently 120 pips profit.  
  
It looks like it kept trying to open a trade all day..  
  
also...   
  
I have the standard 5000 demo account... and all the settings set up for a mini account..   
  
but it opened 4 lots of usd/chf this morning... $35.00 per pip  
  
i guess it should be 0.4 lots for 8% risk on a mini account with usd/chf correct?  
  
or am i missing something?  
  
help!!!

Make sure you set "LotValue" according to your account. Error 134 means not enough money to make the trade.  
  
Mini Accounts require "LotValue" to be set at "1"....

i noticed on another post somewhere that adding a time to trade function on the EA might be good.  
  
i.e. only trade certain currency pairs during when the best times to trade are... to prevent trades during the horrible flat sideways movements.  
  
Hey how about looking at the ATR value continually... if it is > than a certain amount then ok to trade..... then if there is a large move overnight for some reason we can catch it.  
  
thoughts?

GirlFlyer-  
  
Thanks so much for your work and willingness to share. I have read all of the posts and have seen the changes. I am currently testing another EA and can only test two more pairs with my current computer/connection.   
  
I have seen all of the changes from A to B and the different settings. My request is this: If you had to pick the two currency pairs to demo test for the next 2 months, what would they be? What time period? What version of Flyer!? and what optimal settings?  
  
I hope this is not too much to ask as I know you are busy. Best regards.

Tell me about it.... For reliable internet connections, you generally have to have 2 different internet providers. One for primary, one for backup. This is not just for EA's. Its for your own trading. If you do a lot of trading, you need to have backup sources.

I am working currently on an improvement now to reducing trades during flat market times, basically it checks to see if the high/low range for the last several periods is very small. If so, it will ignore the entry signals. But for now, I'm still working on it.

Right now, GBP/USD and USD/CHF are my two favorites as they are performing well on Version A with the settings I have given.  
  
Only further forward testing will allow me to give any further opinion.

GirlFlyer,  
  
I'm running Version A and Version B with suggested presets and no manual intervention for a week, will then post the results. In short, yesterday was a big down day, today is a big up day.  
  
Is it correct to say that the trailing stop will take effect when the price has moved up or down by the TrailingStopValue, but that it only rachets the TS a fixed 10 points? If the TS is set to 60, and the currency goes up 110 pips (GBPJPY today), the trailing stop will be racheted up 10 pips one time and will be 100 pips below the current price, right? Does that risk a big drain of profits before the TS is hit?  
  
Many thanks for all your hard work, both with the EA and with answering everyone's questions. We really appreciate it.  
jdl

first of all thanks GirlFlyer for the EA.  
  
i've made some backtests for periods before 02.15.06 and results are very poor. i've got some questions.   
1.what parameters did You optimized besides extern variables?  
2\. have You made optimization (of extern and other variables if there are others to optimize) let say for a 6 months period, than run a backtest for a month?  
3\. are those results in .doc achieved with parameters optimized for the same period which was used to make a backtest?

Please read the old and new thread of GirlFlyer as to what she has used to test. I have done back tests using the posts in her threads, and the results was very impressive. I believe too many posts on this has been beaten to death already, in backtesting with her EAs, you must use the 1 minute timeframe, other timeframes will not produce desirable modelling quality....

et_phonehome_2, thank You for Your kind reply.  
i've already read all previous posts (old and new thread) and i know i should use M1 tf in backtesting. my results for period mentioned in the .doc file are very impressive too. for previous dates i can not optimize parameters (extern variables) to get decent profit (win/loss ratio neither). that is why i'm asking my questions. maybe i didn't notice answers. if they are answered somewhere than very sorry.  
  
and sorry for my english, it's not my native language.

Wait a minute... I think you got that mixed up in you head ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1). If you use EVERY TICK MODELLING - method in MT4 then it uses ALL timeframes below the one you're testing on. So don't test on M1, just test in any TFrame but make sure you have set it to EVERY TICK.  
BTW, you have to get good data, too (e.g. from Alpari-DataBase). Then use this data for backtesting to get a modelling quality of 90% (Anything below you can throw away!!).  
  
I think there's material about reliable MT-backtesting (which is really not THAT easy) in the beginner's / MT section.

I had to reload Flyer 1.04. I downloaded the 2 files attached to your post #146 connected to the old thread. I forgot which settings are the reccomended settings. The ones that appear in the Flyer!.doc Word document or the settings that appear as comments in the Flyer!.mg4 file.  
  
Thanks,

flyer uses own period for mas (ie 15 for version A) so there is no need to test it on M15. one can test it on lower tfs. M1 gives best results.

this is sentence is not valid. it should rather be: other timeframes will not produce desirable profit.... tradeigel is right modeling quality is sth different.

Best settings are those that appear in the .DOC file. I think I forgot to update them in the code file.

Does that risk a big drain of profits before the TS is hit?

JDL,  
After the first TS level is hit, the S/L is set to + 10 pips, if it goes another level of TS above that, then the S/L is set to 10+TS pips, and so on. That way it keeps jumping the S/L as the profit increases.  
  
Hope that helps.

Hi GirlFlyer,  
  
May I make a suggestion, sometimes it is hard for people reading this thread (myself included) to track down where are the latest settings and where is the latest version of the EA. Maybe it would be best to keep the latest settings in the actual EA?  
  
I, for one, just grabbed the EA and ran in on 4 demo accounts over the last week and have noticed that the results were less then good. 3 accounts n the red one in the black, but only just. And now reading the above post I have just realised that I must have been using the wrong settings. :surprised

Hello Everyone:  
  
For those of you following the development of Flyer!, I wanted to let you know I discovered a gross error in the backtests that created a situation where the profitability of the EA was grossly exaggerated. I finally discovered this problem when after doing a test run on an improvement I did to the EA caused nearly a 100% success rate. At that point I began to question everything because I could not believe that kind of success rate could be achieved. If it could, I would not be talking about it now and go into hiding making millions of dollars.  
  
Anyway, long story short is that the EA uses the 15M timeframe internally for its calculations and runs on Strategy Tester in the M1 setting.... we all know that by now. The catch was, the data I had in my computer for each of the 2 time frames had a 2 hour differential. My 1minute data came from Alpari and the 15 minute came from IBFX. IBFX indexed their data 2 hours ahead of Alpari. Consequently, Strategy Tester was "seeing" into the future and making perfect decisions.  
  
So, what does that mean? I'm still reanalyzing everything, but after resolving the problem, the accuracy of the EA appears to have dropped down to about 65-70% with the drawdowns being much larger. This creates serious questions as to the long term profitability of the EA at this time.  
  
What now? I still believe in the EA and its system because I use this method in my personal trading (much more accurate btw) on a manual basis, but filter out some of the entries according to the larger picture which is much more difficult to program. Accordingly I will continue to work on improvements to the EA and release them as I see fit and show my results for those that wish to continue to follow this method. However, it may be sometime before we see results that come close to what was achieved in the early back tests.  
  
I apologize for the error in the results as I should have been a bit more careful in examining the data and the results.  
  
That's all for now and I'll write some more later regarding new tests and results.  
  
Happy Trading to All!  
  
GirlFlyer

It was still a major effort and a lot of blood,sweat and tears to date..in spite of the "setback"  
  
  
Thank you for your willingness to share!!!  
  
Do not give up...stick to what you believe in and what works for you.

I have been reading your postings and you do have it all together so can the rest of us show our appreciation for all of Marci's efforts... I am new here to this EA and i can see all the repetitions.. maybe the forum format doesn't properly lend itself to finding the summary of information posted by someone as helpful as Marci but we should read it all first instead of seeking to be spoonfed..  
  
Appreciate it Marci.. from a newbee...

Marci,  
  
I have setup the B version and noticed it stating a bid and ask but '0' for the trade. Am i missing something. I believe i've read everything in the document and looked for more at the forum. Sorry as i'm a newbee here...   
  
Appreciate your help and all you've done

Same problem here, and it's not from lack of data. I have 1 min data from Alpari going back to June 2004. I can't figure out why the modeling quality is so low.

I have been testing Version B with IBFX with good results. Today, I had decided to start testing with two brokers, IBFX and MIG. The EA opened trades on MIG, but none on IBFX as of this post. I can only say that the results thus far was not good at all.... Can you tell me what the filters if any are for the triggering of trades? To me, I know it makes a difference which broker this system is used for as I had encountered other issues with other systems also.....

Hi,  
I am very new with MetaTrader. I have came accross many strategies in this forum but cant figure out how to include the indicator to the chart system.  
Can anybody let me know or give me a link on how to do this.  
It would be of great help not only for testing Flyer EA ! but the others too.

Long to short: find the file for download with a .mq4 extension. (Look at post #7). Save it to your desktop. There is a folder in your MetaTrader file called: experts. Drag the file you just downloaded to that file. Restart MetaTrader. You should now see the Expert under "Expert Advisors". (Must click View/Navigator to see the experts and indicators, etc) Drag and drop that expert onto the chart you are using. You should see a smiley face in the upper right hand corner to let you know it is working.  
  
Thanks for your time and energy Marci and good luck with the EA.

With a combination of 60%-70% accuracy and good money management you can be laughing all the way to the bank. Don't let that disappoint you ... that is very impressive and more then enough of an accuracy to actually make money!!!

GirlFlyer,  
  
Though you had found a mistake, the EA is still very impressive in forward testing compared to many of the other EAs I have come across in this and other forums. I can say that at least you are on the right track for even a better EA, and have mproved upon a manual system.....

Thank you ET... and others...  
  
Just to let you know. I have been working on some additional parameters in another updated version I will release I hope before too long that will try to identify the trends on a larger scope so that the EA doesn't get in on the wrong side of a trade...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Thanks for the support. I know what you mean.   
  
And just to back it all up... GBP/USD up +85 pips on a sell from earlier today. Not bad at all...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

My forward demo on Flyer A is currently running at over 450 pips positive spread over 6 trades! and less than 2 full days trade time. All settings exactly as in the most recent docs.   
  
Does anyone know if we can set a different TP?   
  
Amazing so far

Keep up the good work Marci, the flyer is still a worthy EA concept as the logic is quite simple. . . and sometimes simple is all one needs in life : )

Hi Girlflyer  
  
Really impressed with the EA so far, many thanks for sharing. On my forward testing (results as previous post), is it advisable/ feasible to change the SL for individual trades when I have decided the I'm happy with the profits and want to lock in at that point? (eg at 85 pips etc). Will this effect future trades by the EA?.  
  
Also, with the kind of results it is capable of producing, maybe a feature could be that you can set your total profit target for the day (or week, to coincide with the actual open and close of markets) (say 100 pips, day/ 500 pips week) and then all positions would be closed once that target had been reached, and the restart at the following day's/ week's open?  
  
Many thanks again

i have noticed quite a few times now that the EA will get into a trade then the pair will reverse, profit will be negative then the pair makes a nice run the opposite way..  
  
but the neg trade NOT closing out and reversing due to waiting till hits SL instead of closing out on an opposite signal...  
  
hope that made sense.  
  
  
would it be better to just close out positions when the opposite signal is reached... no matter what profit is (pos or neg) ?  
  
To prevent whipsaws during sideways moves overnight... have each pair have different times to trade.  
  
so only OPEN a NEW trade during better trading hours for pair.  
  
this idea may add some more smaller -10 to -20 pip losses here and there but it will get the 100 pip gains that i missed the other day !!! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

I've tried backtesting the EA with this idea in mind, and it actually comes out worse on the tests. Seems to be better off to stick with one direction once the decision is made because the back and forth trading will add up to be more than the total of a S/L.  
  
Also, I know we want the EA's to perform 24/7 for us, but once we start deciding to limit trading hours, etc., we limit the performance of the EA. If you're comfortable with not trading during certain times, turn the EA off and then back on. If you still have open trades from before, it will pick them up again.  
  
Hope that all helps.

While you can manually change the S/L values, it may mess up the trailing stop routine. It's better if you just close out a position manually if you decide your profit is satisfactory.

Iam running the flyer on a demo account with the settings you have recommended and so far iam very impressed..I have been trading manualy for about five years and I have only just realised the potential of the EA's..  
  
  
You are doing a great job.

Chad, I might suggest you change your BrokerMinLotSize setting to 0.1. I've noticed most brokers don't allow 0.01. That might be why you're not getting any trades.

I had the flyer EA running but notice that it wasn't performing any trades. I followed the settings recommend and wondered if there was something else to add. I was using a demo account with 50,000 usd in it and set it to min 5,000 usd and used the defaults. The expert stated that it was reviewing a position but the trade = 0. Can you advise what might be wrong with this. Again, appreciate the fact that real people are as open and sharing out there than we seem to meet on the roads while driving..

Flyer is an open ended EA with no predetermined T/P level. It takes its profit when it determines the trend is over. In the case of Version B, this happens when the WMA 8 line crosses the SMA 10 (simple).  
  
If you wish to set a different T/P, you may manually do so. It will not affect the EA. However, if the exit conditions (ie when the two MA's cross) occur before your T/P level, it will exit anyway. Otherwise, if your T/P hits first, it will exit at that point.  
  
Hope that helps you.

For those of you running Flyer, today should have been a good day. GBP/USD and EUR/USD up nicely. Version B should have nabbed some good profits on both. Version A may not have gotten as much, but still good levels.  
  
  
Thanks for all your input.

Rich,  
  
Make sure you're not getting any errors by checking your Journal tab on MT4. I suggest to everyone not getting any trades to set their minimum lot size to 0.1. Most brokers don't seem to allow the minimum size of 0.01. If this doesn't solve your problem, make sure your charts are loaded on the time period you're running Flyer in.  
  
If after all this, and still no trades, PM me and I will see if I can help.

I'm working on an updated version, however, much to my dismay, read post #156. It explains the reason why the accuracy is so high.

oh, have you converted your 1 minute data upwards for the other time frames?  
  
  
see step 2 here: [http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor...06&postcount=2](http://www.forexfactory.com/forexforum/showpost.php?p=67706&postcount=2)  
  
you can just get alpari minute data and convert it up for all time frames.

Everything's taken care of. All my data is correct now.... arghh... so frustrating that happened to begin with. Oh well, updated version of EA when I get finished optimizing should achieve around 75-80% accuracy which should create for a generally profitable EA.

Girl Flyer,  
  
I don't see where this is coded into your program. Could you point it out to me? Also, can these two MA's be user defined, and if so how would it be programmed? I am trying to see if I can better optimize this. Any help would be appreciated.

been thinking about this:  
  
Pretend for a moment that there is a small down and up whipsaw followed by a major up trend afterwards.  
  
If i were to start the EA before the whipsaw it would get in a sell but stay in the sell even during the major uptrend due to a neg profit level and waiting to hit S/L before next trade.  
  
But, if i were to start the EA just on the upturn of the whipsaw it would get into a buy after cross and get + pips on the major trend.  
  
Soooo.. depending on what time you start the EA you could get different results over a long time period.  
  
Why not:  
  
1) Open a trade at a cross of the MA'S  
2) If another cross happens but still neg pip on first trade open trade in other direction ( hedge it)  
  
3) Just keep doing this.  
  
or something along these lines

I've actually been working on this angle. The results are so so at the moment, but I'll keep you posted on this.  
  
Also, yes you're right about the starting time of the EA. It makes a difference. I've been noticing that most of the major moves on the market come at the opening of the London session followed by later in the day with NY. I may even put a restriction to keep the EA from trading during the off hours when the minor signals cause bad trades... but, all of this takes time and work, so a few things at a time.  
  
Thanks for your observations!

Hi 1Trader2,  
  
The exit conditions are coded in the procedures "CheckToCloseBuy" and "CheckToCloseSell". It is just a simple "If" statement that controls the exit point. As far as the MA's are concerned, feel free to change the coding around for your own purposes, but you can't just change a variable to adjust everything. I didn't design it with that in mind. Hope that helps you.

the only reason i bring this up is that i have been running this EA with the recommended settings and my losing trades are > than my winning ones... not a good sign.  
  
It seems to be missing ALL the good trends because it is waiting to hit the SL or get + pips on a previous trade to the major trend.

Marci,  
  
I know there has been discussion about coding Flyer so users could select if they wanted to trading only when certain markets were open. I found the following code in another expert alert I thought may do the job. If it will do the job, can it be added to the Flyer code as a revision? I am not familiar with the MT4 editor, otherwise I would do it myself.  
  
CODE:  
if ( ((LondonOpen==true && Hour()>=7 && Hour()<=16) ||  
(NewYorkOpen==true && Hour()>=12 && Hour()<=21) ||  
  
(TokyoOpen==true && ((Hour()>=0 && Hour()<=8) ||   
  
(Hour()>=23 && Hour()<=24)))  
  
)   
  
Thanks for your help.

Chad,  
  
If you never saw post #156, that explains what is happening. The EA actually has a win/loss ratio that seems good (around 70% in the end). But in the actual testing and things, it seems that the few losses it has are greater than all the wins it has. This is the hard part of this EA. Trying to fine tune it so that the losses are less than the wins becomes the difficult part. This is why it is necessary to run these on demo accounts.  
  
My suggestion to you, is use the EA as its name implies, an advisor. A little human intervention on the EA to filter out the poor entries, could help to make the profits much greater or reduce the loss trades.  
  
Hang in there though, as I have been working on some improvements, too.

Yes,  
  
I agree on limiting the times the EA trades. On GMT time, from around 20:00 to 05:00 are some of the slowest times which give out false signals. Eliminating the EA from these times may help it. What do you think on the timing?

The line between how much time you give price to move negatively in order to eventually gain your profit, and when you ultimately decide its a bad trade and get out, is a thin one. I am a simpleton, but having a relationship between indicator setup and where the tp/sl is, might be something to look into. In other words, the better the setup, the wider the stop. Also, I read the interview with the guy who is leading the EA Championship. He stressed that his EA is nimble and can turn with the market.   
  
Good luck with the move, Marci, and keep at it.

Marci,  
  
Personally, I would like to be able to choose the time period the Flyer is disabled. I have found not trading between 16:00-5:00 GMT to be the best for me. Yes, sometimes I miss profitable trades, but I miss more losing trades by not trading during that timeframe.

Good Idea... I'll try to make the time frame user selectable.

Thanks, Marci. Making the trading timeframe user selectable would be great. How's the progress going with trying to reduce the number of trades going against the trend? One thing EA users can do now is select "only long" or "only short" in Common Inputs. How many times have we heard "The trend is your friend. Don't fight the trend.". I think there are 3 things we can do to reduce losing trades. 1) Do not trade during the slow time of the day. 2) Only trade with the trend. 3) Do not trade right before or during important US financial news announcements. Total number of trades would be reduced, but I believe that more losing trades would be eliminated than profitable trades. Therefore increasing the overall trading profitability.   
  
Thanks, for all your time and effort making the Flyer successful.

Talking about Vdiddy38. Here is what he said:   
  
<TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 width="100%" border=0><TBODY><TR><TD style="PADDING-RIGHT: 10px" vAlign=top align=justify width="80%">I am a professional forex trader. Hercules was my first EA based on one of my more profitable trading models. The version entered in this competition is a stripped down version of the actual EA. It should be very difficult to beat in a trending market. It is designed to catch and follow large moves. But due to its tight stops, and its ability to close open positions and switch directions when necessary, it remains fairly agile and is able to gain profits in a variety of market conditions. I think the foundation for any good EA must be a very favorable risk/reward ratio... over time its survival will depend upon it.  
  
Good Luck and Happy Trading!

I've been noticing that most of the major moves on the market come at the opening of the London session followed by later in the day with NY. I may even put a restriction to keep the EA from trading during the off hours when the minor signals cause bad trades... but, all of this takes time and work, so a few things at a time.

All i can say is that i find it commendable that we can experience what you've found by the way you share these thoughts with us. Thanks again. Oh and i may have asked this before but does the flyer trade all the time or only on the signals. For example, i left it running in a demo the other night and i get a message of the bid and asked but no action taken. I have checked the settings to no avail. So any suggestions would be appreciated.   
  
Thanks again Marci

everyone has different times on their platforms unfortunatly.  
  
what i usually do is just put in a start hour and a stop hour in the externals for the ea ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) . in small time frames i have found 8:00 gmt - 16:00 gmt is the best times to trade.

I second that the EA should allow one to input their own trading time due to the different brokers GMT time. When one post the pairs results in this thread, the GMT time should be specified to avoid any confusion. From my experience, the worse time to trade is the Asian session due to the slowness. I would say the best time to test the EA is when the Asian/Eurpoean and European/US session overlap, that is where one will see the most movement.   
Just my thoughts....

Hi Everyone:  
  
Just wanted to let you know how the last week went and some performance.  
  
Last Friday was a good day for FlyerV105A for me. +67 pips on the USD/JPY, 33 on the Eur/Usd, 36 on the usd/chf, and 33 on the aud/usd.  
  
Those wins helped to offset some of the losses earlier this week in GBP/JPY and the eur/usd itself.   
  
GBP/USD had 3 trades, 2 wins/1 loss for a net of +35 pips.  
  
Overall, this week was up approximately +150 pips on everything give/take a little as I haven't done the exact math.  
  
Also, I am working on a version 2.00 of Flyer!. With the upcoming version, it takes the best of both Version A and B and combines some features. I will no longer be working on two different versions as it is too time consuming. Plus, the new version will be using some adaptive techniques to either take profit at the levels which Version A currently uses, or Version B depending on how the market is acting.  
  
Additionally, Version 2 will allow you to restrict the trading hours of the EA to trade only during the hours you wish. Back tests have shown that eliminating the Asian session improves the accuracy of the EA.  
  
Finally, the version also attempts to determine the overall trend of the market on a larger time frame in addition to using the 15 minute period for its entry points. This helps to prevent Flyer! from getting in on the wrong side of the larger trend. (How many of you have seen that happen already?)  
  
Oh, and one last addition I added was the capability of the EA to have both Long and Short positions open at the same time. This also helps during flat times on the market when conflicting long/short signals arise. The EA will simply end up being both long/short at the same time, although they probably will not be at the same entry levels. If the market continues to trend within the stop/loss range, it will catch profit both sides of the coin, or if it takes off one direction, will grab the larger profit of the two.  
  
A word of note: If you have not seen post #156, all my earlier versions in the documentation showed accuracy ratios of around 90%. That figure was in error because of a problem I had with my data set being out of sync on two different time frames. That problem was resolved and the accuracy of the previous versions actually turned out closer to 65%. With the upcoming version 2.00, I have increased the accuracy on the Eur/Usd up to approximately 80% during preliminary tests. As of this time, I am still optimizing the EA for other currency pairs.  
  
As you can see, Version 2 is a major update which is why it is taking so long for me to release it. The initial accuracy debacle was a set back at first, but I still felt the EA had great potential. For those of you still testing the EA, I would like to know if there are any other ideas/concepts besides the ones I have listed here you would like to see in the EA.  
  
In the mean time, I may release a "Beta" version of Flyer! V2.00 by tomorrow before I will most likely be out of communication for a few days as I complete my move process. (Which btw is from Prague, Czech Republic up to one of the southern islands of Denmark).  
  
Hope to hear from you all and good luck with the trading!

Girlflyer,  
  
My results was not good for either version last week using InterbankFX, but I believe you had indicated that it depends when the EA [do not recall] was running also if there was any connection issues with either the broker or the internet. I had my PC running 24 hours everyday. All my settings were based upon the docs....  
  
Its good that you will have just one version, as you said, it is much easier to maintain than trying to correct two versions.

Hi, Glad to hear that you are working on merging of both version. Hopefully it will simplify things for you.  
  
In realtion to the sentence quoted above, may I make a sugestion.  
  
How about splitting the original position into two half-sized lots where one half takes profit according to the rules in ver A and the other half takes profit according to rules in ver B?  
  
Or is this what you laready meant to say?

Marci,  
  
Glad to hear that your combining the 2 versions. If I eliminate the trades not between 6:00 - 17:00 GMT, I've had a very good success ratio. So, I'm anxiously waiting for the new version you mentioned. I'm holding my breath. LOL!!! You are doing an excellent job.

Thanks!  
  
Also wanted to let everyone know that I'll be out of touch for a few days most likely. Sorry I wasn't able to get V2.00 done before all this, but I'll be hard at work at it once I get settled in to my new place.  
  
Catch up with you all then!

Hi GirlFlyer,  
  
While this thread seems to have fallen out of favour, I thought that you may be interested in updated results from one of the test runs that I'm still runing.  
  
Results look promising ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

From my testing, one needs to exit out of positions manually to avoid big losses. The results are very good if the pairs trend very well, but that had not been the case for some time....

The way I look at is a little bit different ... if the pairs have NOT been trending and this IS a trending EA, then the sheer fact that it hasn't lost money is a success in itself. Once the pairs start to trend, which they inevitably will, then this should prove to be a small gold mine. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)

Hey everyone!  
  
I'm back with some limited access to the internet until I get my permanent connection. But, I'm moved into my place in Denmark and all is going well.  
  
Look to see an update to the EA soon!  
  
Good luck all!

Nice to have you back ... hope the move didn't wreck too much havock with your senses. Having moved countries (continents) numerous times myself, I always hate to have to pack all of the crap up. These days I travel light 2-3 bags and my trusty old laptop ... speaking of which, maybe it's time for me to upgrade?!?!  
  
In regards to the next version, then are you still planning to combine the two versions earlier released (A & B). And if so what is the methodology for it?  
  
If I'm not mistaken then the two version differed by the exit strategy and I thought that you were merging them by opening up two half sized postions and exiting one with the A strategy and the other half with the B strategy? Am I on the right track here? or something different?

Hi SaltCafe & Everybody Else,  
  
Thanks for hanging in there....  
  
Regarding the new version, the reason why I'm taking so long to update this one is because it is a total upgrade. I have thrown a lot of new techniques and ideas into this one with some promising results, but I'm still fine tuning it right now before I let it out. It takes the best of both my old Version A & B, combines some improved ideas for entries and exits and so far the back testing is giving me about 75-80% on the success rates. While this is a nice percentage, the profit factor is still a little low per trade which is causing the EA to pretty much break even over time. Until I get that resolved, I really don't want to let it go.  
  
Salt, I'm not using split trades in the program. As much as that sounds like an idea, keeping track of every open order in the computer can be a bit of a programming nightmare and right now, the EA is getting complicated enough. The early versions were pretty simple, but now the code is growing and the possibility of getting errors in to the code is getting higher, also.  
  
To explain the EA now in a post is too lengthy. The principle behind the EA is still the same, but there a lot of other factors now that decide the entries and exits. I will write it all out in detail in a document when I finish.  
  
Hang in there everyone!

Nice to see you back. I hope you are still planning on including a manual input for selecting trading hours in any new version. I wouldn't mind seeing one in the 105A version. As I have been having excellent success with it the last 3 weeks to enter trades and then monitoring the trades and manually closing the trades. I sometimes think writing EA code to profitably exit trades is probably far more difficult than writing EA code for entering trades.

Hi GirlFlyer,  
  
In relation to the split trades idea then I was thinking of implementing it through either two seperate magic numbers or a comment for a particular order. Then when you have the logic to close trades, you read what the magic number is (or comment) and based on that decide how to close the trade. It sounds relitivelly simple, but I guess the diificulty is always in the detail.  
  
Anyway, let me know if you would like a hand in this? (If you want to pursue this path)  
  
Thanks, Salty.

Hi Marci,  
  
Glad to hear you finished the move. I haven't moved countries and that alone was a bear so i can appreciate moving even further and the boxes just sitting waiting to be unpacked.. Gool luck in the new place. Oh where do we send the house gifts to?

Hope that was clear that I moved twice in the past two years but within the same State and as mentioned above it was a bear...

It is in my opinion. The right/wrong exit can make all the difference between a profitable and a losing EA. Interesting thing I'm finding out as I go through my tests that a 1 point change in your entry/exit point decisions can make a difference in your profit by sometimes 1000's of dollars.

Over a period of time ... those pips here and there definatelly do add up. However if a one pip difference here or one pip difference there is making such a significant difference in the results then it is an area of concern. Without seeing the results it's hard to comment, however I hope that it doesn't mean that problem actually turns a profitable EA into a loosing one. That would mean that the EA would too sensitive to the anticts that brokers use and that wouldn't be nice.

From my testing of the EAs [both versions], you will see trades which are very profitable only when there is a trend, but if the EA does not exit out, the position will turn out to be a losing one. No matter how good a position is, we want to at least have some type of SL triggered to B/E or trail it to at least keep some of the profits. Of course, all of the settings used during my test was using the default settings as recommended.

I should clarify myself, it is not really a 1pip decision as far as the overall price is concerned. The EA has quite a few different settings involved and the changing of one of those settings by one point can affect the results dramatically because that one point can cause entry points depending on the setting by multiple pips.  
  
Anyway, good news is by Monday I'll have the new version 2.00 ready. I've finally got it where I want it to be and now I'm just cleaning everything up and finding some optimal settings.  
  
Preview of what will be happening!  
  
First let me say that Flyer! has evolved into its own methodology has developed into more than what it started as. I hope that everyone enjoys the strategy. But onwards now.  
  
  
#1 - Manual setting of trading hours is now possible. Works in GMT time. Set the hours you don't want it to trade, and no trading will happen.  
  
#2 - Program is more adaptive to market now and takes into account trends a little better. Entry points remain generally the same idea but I've got it designed to jump in a little quicker if possible. Also, if a quick move causes a signal, but quickly reverses, the EA won't respond to it if it is counter trending. Additionally, both long and short positions can be possible at the same time.  
  
#3 - Exit strategy is completely updated. Several possibilities are now used for exits. On large moves with little or no reversal, the EA will hang on to the position generally as seen in Version 1.05A. This creates huge profit potentials. However, if the price action begins a reversal, it now will jump out if the profit falls too quickly or too much (usually if a quick reversal occurs, 50-75% of the maximum profit is achieved). Overall, the EA now will always get out at a profit regardless if the price exceeds around 35 pips profit or so from the entry price.  
  
As in previous versions, if the price immediately turns around from the entry and goes bad without ever taking a profit of significance, the S/L will exit the trade.   
  
However, with the way things are now, you will not likely see profitable positions turn into losing positions unless the market reacts extremely quick. I think you will find this the most innovative feature of the EA.  
  
#4 - Settings for the EA for the tested pairs will be already installed in the EA. You won't have to set them. There are many more variables than what I had before and having the user set them would be difficult to explain, so I've just made it so that you don't have to mess with the majority of them. You can still change things such as S/L values, etc. But the more complicated ones are a no worry factor.  
  
Hope this whets your appetite for what is to come.... and if you want to drool a little more, the EA showed on backtests (no data problems this time and with 90% modelling quality) with the usual 8% investment, GBP/USD turned $10000 into $30000 in 9 months.  
  
Look for the release sometime Monday! Good luck all!

<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /><o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)> </o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)>  
  
Here it is, the long awaited version 2.00 of Flyer!  
  
<o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)> </o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)>  
  
This has been a while in coming for several reasons, mainly because of my move from <?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /><st1:City w:st="on">Prague</st1:City> to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)lace w:st="on">Denmark</st1![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)lace></st1:country-region>, but also because of the difficulty in coming up with an EA that can be consistently profitable.  
  
<o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)> </o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)>  
  
This new version is much more complicated than any of the Version 1 variations. The principles behind the EA are still the same, but allows for more flexibility on entries and exits although it is biased towards finding better exits as I felt the previous versions lacked in that area the most.  
  
<o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)> </o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)>  
  
I have only been able to fully back test the EA on EUR/USD, GBP/USD, and USD/CHF. For those of you wishing to use other pairs, you will need to come up with some settings for yourself that work. Feel free to message or email questions.  
  
<o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)> </o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)>  
  
Of the three pairs I have tested, Flyer! performs by far the best with GBP/USD. Strangely this notoriously volatile pair gives the best results. I believe this has something to do with the fact that cable is usually trending somewhere… it doesn’t like to sit and consolidate like many of the other pairs, which will degrade the performance of the EA.  
  
<o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)> </o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)>  
  
For a more complete description of the EA, read the attached document, but below is a summary of the EA’s features.  
  
<o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)> </o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)>

  1. It’s generally a moving average crossover EA with some variations.
  2. Exit strategy changes dynamically according to the market conditions.
  3. You can now limit the trading hours of the EA.
  4. Trailing Stop Feature can be enabled/disabled.
  5. Most data settings are now pre-set in the code to reduce complexity for the user.
  6. As the market changes, you can modify the settings to adjust the entry/exits to match the market behavior.

Attached you will find the documentation for the EA, some sample back tests, and some charts of selected trades, and the code. Hope everyone enjoys!

First of all, I don't advise anyone to trade real money with any EA until you have fully tested it on a demo account and it works to your satisfaction.  
  
Aside from that, the settings and instructions are in the documentation and/or the code.  
  
Beyond that, if you have any specific questions, I will try to answer them as timely as possible.

Hi Marci,  
  
Good to see you back in the game. However, I'm not sure I understand your "difficulty in coming up with an EA that's consistently profitable"!! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)   
  
Congrats on your persistence, your desire to adapt, improvise and dominate. I'll resume testing after digesting and understanding your documentation.  
  
BTW: Have you considered starting a new thread with this new version? Perhaps a good time to start.

Is the MAs posted in the doc what you are looking for? I just like to see the indicators on my charts and not have an EA blindly do things so I can visualize it. Maybe you can post the template you are using with the EA.  
  
USDCHF LWMA: 16, 18  
EMA : 40, 50  
  
EURUSD, GBPUSD  
LWMA: 7, 9, 8, 10  
EMA : 18, 28  
  
Is this correct?

Marci,  
  
Installed the new version. Set LimitHours = 1, StartHours = 19, and EndHours = 9. The EA opened a trade at 1:30. Should the times be reversed?  
  
Thanks,

Hi Marci  
  
Firstly Thanks for all the hard work,  
before I load the ea, Iam looking at using the Limit hours feature should we not include the server time.  
  
Or is that a default setting.

Documentation digested....EA loaded and running as of 1:55 gmt.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)   
  
I made one change to your recommended settings: I open trading at 08:00 gmt rather than 07:00 gmt, although I think the latter is appropriate for day light savings time in the eastern US.  
  
_Question_ :  
I noticed you list "MA=0" as well as undefined MAs numbered 1-4 in the code. Do we need to set the MAs or will the MA arrays as the array relates to the currency pair suffice?

The trading hours are the times you don't want to trade, NOT the times you want to trade.

The MA's are loaded from the arrays. You don't have to set them. You can change the settings in the arrays if you want, though.

You have 4 out the 6 MA's needed. You need from the arrays within the code, MA,MA1-MA5. I will try to set up templates for some of the various pairs. However, remember the entry/exit conditions won't be the same all the time, especially the exit. The entry is more consistent, though.

From what I understand, you will no longer be bothering with Version 1 A and B, any changes will strictly be in Version 2 and latter versions you will be putting out.

A little more than 24 hours later, Flyer! v2 opened its first trade at 11:00 gmt, shorting cable at 1.9495. Current price is 1.9491. Is the EA showing a trend reversal for cable?

etock,  
  
If you're trying to use Flyer! v2.0 please understand it is an Expert Advisor (EA). It is not an "indicator" as you stated. Change the path to  
**c:\metatrader4\experts.**

First trade just closed with a $10.00 profit, having moved into profit as much as 26 pips. The trade survived a 50 plus-pip spike during the US GDP revision news announcement at 13:30 gmt. After the announcement, trade closed.  
  
**See attached chart.**  
  
Appears as though the EA closed based on the second exit strategy:  
  
"A second possibility occurs when the price rapidly drops below the longer of the two Exponential MA’s and is still in a profit."  
  
And it didn't quite make the fourth exit strategy as it only moved 26 pips in profit:  
  
"For a 4<SUP>th</SUP> possibility, if the price exceeds 28 pips of profit and then retraces rapidly, it will exit if the price drops to 3 points above entry price."  
  
For analysis and testing, I plan to add the moving averages for visual confirmation of entries and exits (after the new home sales are released in thirty minutes).

If you want help with the later versions, I can still offer advice. But, I really won't be updating them.

The way the EA looks at the current trend is by counting backwards from the current time for (x) bars. If the each close on the average is higher than the open, the trend is up, and vice versa for down. For CABLE, the (x) is 22. So, go back 22 bars, and see what the trend looks like. If it is down, the EA will try to sell if the signal is valid for a short. This is what happened for that trade. Despite the GDP spike, it looks like Cable might be starting to top out on its most recent run for now. Even the 1Hr chart is starting to signal as well. The 18 & 28 MA's are starting to flatten out. Once that occurs, often we see the change in trend there, but of course nothing is guaranteed.  
  
Thanks for testing MM, I haven't been able to do much live testing with this version yet as I've only got temporary access to the internet until Monday, when my permanent speedy 8MB connection will be installed. Finally!

Au contraire! Thanks to you Marci. You did the hard work. The least we traders can do is help with testing the product as well as respond to some of the easier questions you're bound to get (repeatedly, and again).  
  
UPDATE:  
During the New Home Sale announcement/whipsaw followed by dollar strength despite apparently dollar-negative news.... at 15:07 gmt, Flyer! opened a second trade, again shorting cable. 22 bars back and the down trend is apparent.

I have found some better settings for the USD/CHF.  
  
Change (in the code) in the arrays the 3rd element (the one for USD/CHF)  
  
MAArray = 4,  
MA3Array = 10  
ProfitArray = 45  
GapArray = 20  
  
Hope this helps everyone

Profit down to $220.00. Live trading I would have exited manually unless there's really a compelling reason not to.

In testing version 2, in order to keep the profits, one needs to exit manually. I had some large gains, but only to see it become small, and some pairs lose using FIXED LOT of 1 with USE TS = 1.

Early results quite promising:   
  
3 trades since Monday, 3 winners for 117 pips. Obviously 3 winning trades provides insufficient evidence to conclude anything but Flyer! caught yesterday's downturn for 42 pips and the overnight uptick in cable for 74 pips (long at 1.9491; liquidated at 1.9565). Last two trades were manually closed. See attached.  
  
Marci, I know you're awaiting your hi-speed connection. When you get a chance please advise as to whether manual closures adversely impact the EA. Perhaps I simply imagined you said something to that effect.   
Thanks.

No, there is no problem with manually closing trades. It will just treat the manual close as if it got stopped out.  
  
I don't know how it will effect your long term performance, though. But if you're always closing at a profit manually, of course your profit will have to exceed the occasional S/L. But you know that...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Et, in my experience with backtesting, the T/S function actually hurts the performance of the EA in the long run. Too small of an interval on the T/S (such as a 30pip T/S) creates for early exits which reduces profits, and if you make it too large, nothing happens anyway. It's better to just let the EA decide on where the best exit is vs. using the T/S.  
  
As for taking profits, I don't know what you're aiming for on profits each trade, but the EA is designed to take advantage of huge moves and profit from them. If you jump out early, you could potentially miss larger profits. For example, in looking at cable today, with it going long around 1.9495 or so, it would still be in the trade as of now where the price is at 1.9660. That would be a 170 pip gain. This is one of the reason the EA is profitable over the long term, because it can catch 100,200,or even 300 pip moves. Just because 1 trade drops back down after jumping up 30 pips or so or even 50 then comes back down to 10 or 15 doesn't constitute reason for the EA to jump out unless its heading for negative territory. It will simply wait until the next swing back up. If it never happens, it will generally get out before too long, because the MA's will signal the change. Sure, it doesn't always take maximum profit. I'm sure we all don't do that, either in our personal trading. It's a tradeoff. However, I stick with the EA and its decision points because with the testing, it shows profitability over long term. That's my primary goal here. Of course, you are welcome to exit manually, if you feel comfortable with it. Afterall, it's an "advisor".![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

I now have some settings for USD/JPY. Again, this is a tricky pair to deal with and resorted to ranges on the MA's being far different than EUR/USD.  
  
Here's what to put in the EA for the data arrays...  
  
Set the 4th element of each of the following arrays (4th is USD/JPY)...  
  
TrendArray = 35  
  
MAArray = 8  
MA1Array = 14  
MA2Array = 16  
MA3Array = 14  
MA4Array = 36   
MA5Array = 48  
MaxBarArray = 8  
GapArray = 16  
ProfitArray = 50  
SpreadArray = 40  
  
Finally, your stop loss should be at 54.  
  
Accuracy on the back tests for these settings showed about an 80% success rate from June 1, 2006 to present with a $10,000 investment just over $18,000 by the end of the test.  
  
Good luck

Although it's still early and the jury remains sequestered, Flyer! makes a compelling argument as a "set it and forget it" EA. I manually closed the cable move at 77 pips (the genius that I am) and missed the other 100 pips! duh. For me, this will require a different "hands-off" discipline to trust the EA and rely on it's decision points as opposed to the newstrading discipline where I play a more active role.

Marci,  
  
Can you please help me. Attached is the code for Flyer 105A to which I pasted the Nontrading Hours code that is in Flyer V200. However, it does not work. Could you please look it over and tell me were I went wrong.  
  
After I pasted the code in the MT4 editor, I did compile the code and there were no errors.  
  
Thanks,

Hi PTOURNIS  
  
I also have it open 24 hours and no trades. However I did notice that I had a small face in the upper right corner but he wasnt smiling. To get it to smile you need to open the expert advisors > properties > common tab and click on <allow live trading>  
  
Additionally the Expert Advisors on the main menu bar must have a green mark on it. I will wait and see if this allows trades to be opened

Koh,  
  
Last thing I need to see is a white sandy beach, blue water and blue skies!! Winter storms already shut down Chicago's airport (12 inches of snow) and it's headed this way.  
  
Temptingly great idea, trading from the beach!!![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

You would have to explain to me as to what is not working? I don't see any obvious problems right off to start....

Results:  
  
Earlier, around 12:30 central eur time, Eur/$ and Cable opened with opposite trades within 30 minutes of each other. Eur/UsD short closed at a loss of 47 pips; Cable long, I just manually closed at a profit of 121 pips. I missed an additional 47 pips because quite frankly I'd forgotten it was trading.  
  
But here's the "interesting" story. I put Flyer!v2.0 into my live package last night, perhaps a couple of hours after re-starting it in the demo platform. Set it up for 10 lots (risk averse? what's that? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) )  
  
And of course.... it didn't open a single trade!! 121 pips with 10 lots and it didn't open.

Oh that's funny! The EA doesn't require margin to open an order. It would open the order and if margin was insufficient, the broker would so inform you. But that's funny, that's a good one!!

Is the above pretty typical for a given day. 2-4 trades picked a day?  
  
Looks pretty good to me.

The opening times and prices of your two trades for today 1 December match the two trades I had with Eur/$ and cable going in opposite directions. Our closes are different. Presumably you manually closed or did you allow the EA to exit?

did everyone have opposing EURUSD orders opened? I only a sell EURUSD order which I got stopped out of. It seems weird to me that the EA didn't place a buy order for EURUSD, the MAs clearly crossed. Can anyone help me figure this out?

I agree. up trend on both.  
  
it appears it enter a hedge position.  
  
In all the performance has been good all but two trades that went to SL and therefore has taken the overall profit down..  
  
I will look at the trailing stop option..

That's the two. I got out at 1.9800, +$1,210 on cable only because I forgot the demo was running. As you know cable ran as high as 1.9848 Friday.  
  
I think my live account didn't open the cable trade because I didn't shut down and reopen the live system after compiling the EA.

Hello Girlflyer and everyone!  
  
I've been reading this new Flyer! thread and can't wait for trading to start this coming week to demo this latest version! It's awesome to see people such as yourself willing to share talents, time, and resources without asking for compensation (which would be quite deserved, btw...). It is my belief that our Heavenly Father rewards such actions 100 fold!! Allow me to say **THANK YOU** for your generous spirit!!   
  
While making the recommended code optimizations for USDCHF and USDJPY, I noticed that your code is well commented and that goes a long way for helping those of us who aren't programmers muddle through.   
  
I won't ramble on further, but I thank you again for your efforts here and I hope to somehow contribute if/where possible, maybe through backtesting and/or demo testing.   
  
Take care and God Bless!

I have had it opened for 3 days with smiley faces, tried recompiling, etc. etc. but still no trades. Will try a different account and see if that does the trick.

You should post your chart and indicate what broker you use. I have tried this on different brokers, and they do not all open trades since it will depend upon if the MAs did occur or not. Not all things are created equal.

Does anyone know which broker GirlFlyer uses? I would like to use a broker I can not only trust but seems to work well with this system. I have heard some bad things about IBFX so I think I will stay clear of them for now. Money Ma$ter seems to have his act together enough that he's starting to trade live. Can't wait to get started, can anyone offer a suggestion?

Marci,  
  
Suggestion to your code to improve EA's own trades recognition...  
There is a feature in MT4 called OrderMagicNumber. It's any integer, that is assigned to order as additional parameter. This alows to place any custom comments (e.g. I modify all EAs to place name of EA in the comments, as I currently run 6 different EAs in one MetaTrader) and still uniquely recognize EA's own trades.  
If you find this feature usefull, this is how to add it into your version 2:  

Inserted Code
    
    
     
    // add this line after line 15 (actually anywhere on the top):
    #define MAGICTEST 32416 
     
    // Line 343:
    TicketNum = OrderSend(Symbol(),OP_SELL,LotSize2,Bid,3,Bid+StopLossVal*Point,0,Symbol()+VerString,MAGICTEST,0,Green); //Open the order.
     
    // Line 267:
    TicketNum = OrderSend(Symbol(),OP_BUY,LotSize2,Ask,3,Ask-StopLossVal*Point,0,Symbol()+VerString,MAGICTEST,0,Green); //Open the order.
     
    // Line 818 substitute with this test:
    if(OrderMagicNumber() == MAGICTEST)

  
That's it!  
Let me know if there are any errors in the code or it's not working out for you.

**RESULTS**  
  
Overnight, Flyer! v2.0 jumped into the cable profit-taking at 1.9785 that happened after London opened, then preserved some profit when it reversed, exiting at a price of 9778 at 10:16 gmt.   
  
08:45 gmt saw Flyer! go long at 9777 and is currently in profit as cable ranges between 9780s and 9790s.  
  
Marci,  
  
So Flyer! establishes a hedge on its own but under what conditions?

I've been following this thread from the beginning, and have to applaud all of the hard work that GirlFlyer has done such a well documented EA.  
  
I would like to know of suggestions for a broker that this EA works well on. I have been forward testing on North Finance, and IBFX, and the results that I am getting do not look anythin like the results I see posted here by Glenn5T and MoneyMa$ter.  
  
Thanks in advance for the help..

What parameters are you using for the Cable? My first long of the day opened 12-4-06 08:45 @ 1.9777 and closed at 12-4-06 10:52 @ 1.9782.  
  
I let the EA run its course and did not interfere or place manual entries.  
  
![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)  
  
It looks like your trade ended around 16:00 is this true?

Hello yezbick.  
  
I have done nothing manually, just letting the default do its thing.  
My last completed trade was long 10:43 GMT @ 1.9768, and closed 1.9781 at 17:54. As mentioned, now in new long 1.9787

We have almost the same results for profit on the above but mine closed early for some reason?

Hey everyone!  
  
After my move, I was without a stable internet connection (borrowing the libraries wireless hotspot!). But, now have my connection up and running good so I'll be able to respond to inquiries a bit faster.  
  
Looks the first week results are going pretty good. Say GlennT's results and they looked promising.  
  
Thanks for all the kind words and support.

Live results:  
  
**$1,850.00 profit; +$240 float**. In a choppy market. See attached. Can I stop kicking myself in the head for not restarting the platform after compiling? Only cost me 12 large, that is $12,000 profit on the cable move up, that's all. That's okay. I'll get it tonight.  
  
What I find compelling is that the EA will take its time, find an entry, ride the trend then exit capturing some profit should the trend reverse. If the pair continues trending in the new direction, the EA buys (or sells as appropriate). Only unsettling piece is that there appears to be a hedge function that I don't recall reading about in either thread or in the documentation. In any event, other than Eur/USD, the EA performs relatively well, understanding that GirlFlyer's been debugging the code for a while, if you count the original version.

Wow thats a good return. Say can you explain your statement about restarting the platform after compiling?   
  
Thanks for your input, I'm a little new with the terminology. Is this something we all should do?

I'm not really clear on the rule, but there are times when EAs won't execute unless you: (1) compile it; and (2) restart the platform, meaning exit and logon again.  
  
There are times when I compile other EAs and execution is no problem; other times when I compile the same EA and it fails to execute, unless I restart the platform. So I honestly don't see the rhyme or reason to it. I do know my demo platform ran Flyer! with one lot for $1,200 and the live platform didn't execute Flyer! during the same period.   
  
So if your EA is not executing after compilation, and you've got the smiley faces and trades allowed, etc., but still nothing after 24 hours, I would suggest removing the EA from the chart, closing the platform, restarting the platform and reinstalling the EA on the chart.

Just click and open it. It should automatically load in your meta-editor library. Compile it, close and re-open your platform, then add it to the desired chart(s).  
  
Better yet, see the following thread:

MM,  
  
There is no intentional hedging feature, but is an automatic result of allowing the EA to trade both short and long at the same time. I've seen on the backtests where in indecisive markets, its a nice addition to pick up some cash both ways. Theoretically, with the EA watching the trend, it shouldn't be open both ways, but sometimes after going one way, the trend changes and it buys into it the other way. If the market consolidates for a period of time during this kind of situation, it is likely that it will pick up a profit both ways.  
  
Anyway, regarding the Eur/usd... the settings that were given initially may not be the most optimum for it. I will be doing some further research on it and see what I can come up with. The EA keeps surprising me sometimes where it finds that right balance to come up with good profits.  
  
Glad its working well for you. I'm finally live now 24/7 so I can keep a good eye now on how it works forward testing.

My apologies everyone.  
  
Subtract the 10-lot $1,000 cable trade from Flyer!'s results. That was another EA. So Flyer! produced $850.00 in profit, plus the float I reported earlier, which declined and I closed out at $110.00 profit for a total of **$960.00.**

Live. That's why I keep taking profit because it's forwardtesting "live", using standard lots.

Are you letting Flyer EA run on its own (Start and Exit) or are you making manual adjustments as it goes? Are you trading on all 3 pairs that have been tested so far?

Default is for eur/usd. You need to just set your stop loss on GBP/usd to 58. The rest is done automatically

yezbick,  
pls refer to titles in my posts which indicate the version, whether demo, the currency pair(s) and the chart...  
Flyer! initiates all trades; I manually exit most trades.

Hi guys,  
  
This week I started to forward-test Flyer V200 on GBP. I have 3 trades so far. When I run a backtest on these few days - I got exactly the same results as my forward test. Entry and exit points were exactly the same, and total pip gain was also the same.  
Now, data. I downloaded M1 history for past 7 years from my FXDD broker. So in all back tests M1 period was used for modeling. For the settings: I used Period M30 (!!!), Model: every tick.  
Quite interesting....  
Anyways, I'll continue to forward test, and see if there will be any deviation...  
  
MoneyMa$ter,  
how do you choose to close trade manually? Major support/resistance levels? Or other indicators? News?

Orkan, could you PM me with a copy of your report for those 7 years. I haven't been able to get 7 years worth of data, I would be curious as to what it looks like...  
  
Thanks,  
GF

Hi, I'm new to this MT4. I downloaded the file in the expert folder and I see it, but when I tried to use it with default value in the GBP/USD 15 min chart, nothing shows up. Am I doing it correct? How does the chart looks?  
  
Thanks in advance. 

I'm a disciplined trader and that's the only way I trade.

The EA does not draw anything on the screen. Post #260 in this thread has some templates to get an idea of the MA's the EA uses. You can get a visual idea of the concept by adding those to your MT4.  
  
Hope that helps.

Marci,  
  
Problem is a quirk with MT4. I resolved the problem by removing Flyer 105a from all my charts. I then closed and restrated my trading platform. After which I attached the version to my charts. So far it has not taken a trade during nontrading hours. Hopefully it will take trades during trading hours later tonight.

ok, it's not the first time I've found problems with MT4. Let me know if you still get any problems.

PipHunter,  
  
In the code, the tunnel EMA's are defined under MA4Array & MA5Array for each currency pair. But here they are anyway.  
  
EURUSD = 18/28  
GBPUSD = 18/28  
USDCHF = 40/50  
USDJPY = 36/48

If you don't mind a 100 pip S/L on your Eur/usd, here are some settings that produced good results for the eur/usd on the EA backtested for the last year...  
  
For element #1 of the arrays in the code...  
  
TrendArray = 22  
MAArray = 4  
MA1Array = 6  
MA2Array = 8  
MA3Array = 10  
MA4Array = 24  
MA5Array = 36  
MaxBarArray = 4  
GapArray = 18  
ProfitArray = 25  
SpreadArray = 50  
  
and your Stop/Loss = 99  
  
do not use the T/S, so UseTS = 0.  
  
1 year period on $10000 investment resulted in $9604 of profit and 82% accuracy.  
  
Sample report is attached  
  
Enjoy!

Orkan,  
Late evening, just getting back to a digital contraption based on zeros and ones.  
  
To answer your question, there's just something about trading 5 standard lots, live, on a relatively "new" EA that encourages closing when in profit!! Nothing technical about it at all.  
  
On the other hand, today Flyer! opened one trade, shorting cable at 1.9758 around 12:30 GMT Tuesday 5 December and it immediately went into the red. I manually closed at a loss when it hit 9770 [oh ye of little faith MM!]. And as we all know cable moved as low as 9674, 80 some-odd pips profit had I let Flyer! continue. So, while I think this is a pretty good EA, the trust factor must increase. I do think Marci's on to something here which is why I went live.

I got into this short also. But I let Flyer decide when to close, and gained +20 pip profit... (well, I'm still on demo, it's easy not to do anything). Although If I would close it when I thought it'll be good idea to close it (at jut about 9685) I could have some 60 pip more... But still, sometimes I close manually, and see trend continues...

Hi everyone,  
  
I'm wondering if anyone noticed a particular time frame this EA works better (profitable) in GU, EU, and UC. Do you see any drawbacks using M30 or H1?  
Any favorite time frame and why?  
Thanks in advance. 

I'm a disciplined trader and that's the only way I trade.

Yeah I agree that the EA doesn't close the position fast enough. I had 80pips profit but the EA waited and it closed the position at 20 pips profit. But I guess that what you have to put up with when dealing with a trending EA.

> I got into this short also. But I let Flyer decide when to close, and gained +20 pip profit... (well, I'm still on demo, it's easy not to do anything). Although If I would close it when I thought it'll be good idea to close it (at jut about 9685) I could have some 60 pip more... But still, sometimes I close manually, and see trend continues...
> 
> Ignored

As much as the EA has problems not closing soon enough for quick profits, I have found that often times it doesn't hold on to something long enough, as well. The challenge is finding a balance on the exit strategy. The EA does not trade that often... maybe once a day per pair if a good signal happens. In a really good, well behaved trend, it will follow it all the way to the end. If you have done some backtests yourself, GU is a good example where it can follow a trend for 2-300 pips before closing out. I've even seen it hit 700 pips before. Our human impatience and greed to lock in any gains we have can see the performance of the EA degrade over time if you continue to close early, because then the major trend can be (and most likely will be) missed and profits will be reduced. Thereby when the EA gets stopped out on a future trade(s), equity just isn't there... and eventually your account goes into the red.  
  
I've tried hundreds of simulations on my computer with various exit strategies.... trailing stops... outright t/p levels, etc.... and they all generally fail because not enough profit is taken to outweigh the losses. Set your S/L too low, and you get stopped out all the time. Set your S/L too high and you lose too much versus your gains (but your accuracy goes up).   
  
Every decision we do with the markets determines our profitability over time. I have begun to understand so much more about the F/X game and how everything interrelates since writing Flyer!. Making the right entry point is in my opinion less than half the decision. The more important decision is when to get out. Think of your money as doing business. Your business has to make so much money on each sale in order to cover the expenses of your product. In this case with forex, the profits you take (the sale of your product) each time have to exceed your expenses (your losses, cost of internet, electricty, etc...) over time or you eventually lose money. So, if you figure you have x% of accuracy rate to make at least (y) amount of pips then you have to make (z) amount (at least on the average) per transaction to cover your losses. Find that correct ratio, and you have a winning formula. Problem is, your formula is constantly changing because the market is changing. Which brings me to the point, that 2 or 3 months from now, we may have to change settings on Flyer! to accomodate a new market.  
  
As time goes on, and I/we see ways to keep improving the EA, plus adapting to new market conditions, we can continue to have a profitable EA. I put this out here in the public because I feel that we all have a right to be able learn from other people. This forum has been a tremendous help for me, so therefore, I am returning the favor. I only ask that if you use the EA, help contribute to its earning potential by suggesting, offering, and implementing improvements. There will be a few people who probably abuse the situation and just want a free money making machine without working for it. If that's you, just remember the EA is what it is (an advisor). You won't be able to just let it go, and eventually make money for nothing!... you still have to work for it.  
  
My two pips worth today!

There is no fixed T/P level. It determines an exit point dynamically according to the market conditions. It generally tries to exit after so much profit level is reached and the short LWMA's reverse direction. Read the documentation and/or look at the code for further details.

The version 2 Flyer is very impressive. As I recalled, many of the positions could have had a larger gain if I had closed it manually, but I just allowed it to run based upon the EA settings which was using the defaults except for anything concerning lot size. If your statements are differ from mine, it may be due to at times the Internet may have been down....  
  
Girlflyer, keep up the good work....

Girlflyer,  
  
Its always better to have less trades that is profitable than to be in the red. I would say based upon my testing with this and prior versions, version 2 and 1B, is to more profitable than version prior to 1B.   
  
I am not sure if this is part of the EA. Is it possible to open multiple positions, eg., 2, and close one position as each target level is made. I know that it overly complicates the EA. If trade 1 hits a TP = 15, then trade 2 would adjust itself to B/E, just a thought.  
  
====  
  
Have anyone tried using the EA on any other timeframes?

Here is my experience withe different timeframes....  
  
Backtesting has shown M30 to be optimal in the general sense because it will take a greater number of trades, thereby increasing overall profits. H1 can and does work and you can take larger profits at one time, but you have to find a totally different set of numbers to go in the data arrays. However, the drawback is that you may go several days in between trades because the trends become larger and longer. You also have to be willing to set your stop losses higher, etc. It's a tradeoff.... In the end run, my opinion the M30 setting is slightly better.  
  
Good luck!

Thanks, ET, I'll try that. I've changed FixedLots to 1. I'm wondering if LotValue really matters though since it's not using the MM routine.

Lot Value is the amount each of your lots is worth. Generally most standard accounts the value is 100,000 per lot. If you use a mini-account where your lots are worth 10,000.... then you have to set it to 1.

Hi, Marci  
  
I have your new EA up and running as well. I have only seen one positive trade that like the others was over 80 pips at one point and closed +18. Still I like the way it works. MoneyMaster said in a post a while back that EAs required restarting from time to time - is that correct? I have had several running over a period of time and didn't do that. BTW...thanks for all your input as well MM, very inspiring! I like your guts.

Marci,  
  
Your v200 doc speaks to basically 4 MAs, 2 short term and 2 long term. I see those on the template as the 2 red MAs and 2 white MAs. But I also see a yellow and a magenta MA. Are those the MAs that exit a trade when price levels off? Thx

Yes, they are the primary method of exiting, but there are other factors involved, too. Too fast of momentum in the opposite direction causing the profit to drop below a certain percentage (derived from ProfitArray) will also cause an exit, and a couple of other minor conditions.

I think you missed my question. Why is it even necessary to calculuate equity if its trading fixed lots and not using the money management routine?

Because it also has to know whether or not you have enough money to open a position... regardless of the MM routine or not.

Okay.  
  
Flyer! just brought five (5) lots of cable at 1.9687 at 05:02 gmt. I will let Flyer! run its course, without human intervention.....mostly because I'm sleepy! -$550.00 at the moment. Nonetheless, I will sleep well.  
  
This is reality TV at it's finest. Let's see what happens overnight as I'm expecting a cable uptrend. Tune in tomorrow for the next episode.  
  
Edit: -$950.00 AT 05:49 GMT.  
  
Another edit: -$200.00 AT 06:08 GMT.

Marci,  
  
I thought I had resolved the problem, but I guess I haven't. I have Flyer 105A installed on 2 computers "A" & "B" using the same platform, Interbank FX with different demo accounts. On computer A the inputs are LimitHours = 1, StartHours = 17, EndHours = 7. On computer B the inputs are LimitHours =1, StartHours = 7, EndHours = 17. Flyer 105A was reinstalled on both computers at about 16:30 GMT on 12/6/2006. From 16:30 GMT until 23:59 GMT on 12/6/2006 they both worked perfectly. The EA on computer A did not open any positions during that time. The EA on computer B opened 3 positions during that time between 18:33-18:49 on 12/6/2006 as they should have been. However both of them opened the identical 4 trades between 00:48-01:34 on 12/7/2006 and just now they both opened a eur/usd trade at 05:22 GMT. The EA on computer A should not have opened the positions. It seems that the date change is causing a problem. Please see attached pdf files.   
  
Can you help me?

Marci,  
  
Fisrt of all, my english is not my mother language. Please try to understand my english.  
I have followed your EA Flyer for awhile, and the new version is great. After I forward-test, I found like others that it will exit slow, and lose some profit. I think that can you add some indicator or oscillators for filter to Long or Short or Exit condition, instead of using only MA.  
  
Can you consider it?

\---------------  
  
I will always continue to improve upon the exit strategy of Flyer, however it goes against the theme of the EA to use different methods. I think the problem that most people are failing to recognize here is the fact that the EA is designed to take the maximum amount of advantage from a trend. If you're happy with 25-75 pips worth of gain, sure I could design it to make sure that it always takes that. But, you will lose money in the long run with the EA. The attempt of the EA is if the trend takes you for a 200 pip ride, it wants most of that. But if along the way, it retraces for 25 or 30 pips... most humans jump out running with the profit only to miss the larger run. Flyer will hang on to it as long as possible looking for the next jump up until the overall trend is over even to the extent of hanging on to the position for several days if necessary. I hope you understand it is a difficult challenge to find that balance to achieve this goal.  
  
If your goal is to have an EA trade daily without exception for an average 50 pip gain, Flyer should not be your choice. There will be days it makes only 25-30 pips a trade or less, and then there will be days it will make +100 pips, and of course it will get stopped out from time to time. Last, it will often not even trade at all over the course of day.  
  
  
However, here is a suggestion. If you want the EA to take a larger portion of a short term run up, change the setting in the "ProfitArray". This is a percentage value that the EA will let the profit decrease to before exiting once the MA's represented by MAArray and MA3Array cross. Setting it to 80-85% will most likely increase its chances of taking a greater profit in the short term, but will cause it to jump out of trades early missing the bigger picture.  
  
Hope all this helps to understand everything.

DBCMKX,  
  
Paste the following code in place of the previous code into your version. It should fix the problem. The problem was with the way I was handling the minutes in the routine.  
  
Marci  
  
if(LimitHours>0)  
{  
TimeNowH = Hour();  
TimeNowM = Minute();  
if((TimeNowH == StartHours && TimeNowM >= StartMins) || TimeNowH > StartHours) //Are we past the starting point of the day?  
{  
if(EndHours>=StartHours) //Is the ending time the same day?  
{  
if((TimeNowH == EndHours && TimeNowM <= EndMins) || TimeNowH < EndHours) //If so, are we still within that timeframe?  
{  
return; //Yes, return back and don't trade.  
}  
}  
else //If the ending time is in the next day, we are automatically in the restricted time frame. Don't trade.  
return;  
}  
else //New day ...   
{  
if(EndHours<= StartHours && ((TimeNowH == EndHours && TimeNowM <= EndMins) || TimeNowH < EndHours))  
return;  
}  
}

Thanks go to DBCMKX for discovering a bug in the Limit Hours function of the EA. I will post a corrected version of the EA later today or you can cut and paste the code from my previous message to him over the current code in the "CheckToOpen" procedure....

Flyer executed a gbpud long at 1.9686. Why didn't it exit when the magenta and yellow crossed and/or why did it not reverse positons when the white MAs crossed back over the red MAs. See the attached pic. Thanks.

Not sure what you are using for your settings, but mine did exactly what you talked about. It went long at 1.9682, exited at 1.9684 after the fall back down, and now has gone short at 1.9664.  
  
However, you will have to remember that the EA also tries to determine the trend of the market and even if the the MA's cross the tunnel, it may not execute a buy if that direction is counter-trend.  
  
But, given the fact that we didn't have same executions, I imagine your broker feed created enough of a difference that it didn't do everything mine did or you have different settings.

**RESULTS**  
  
05:02 gmt, Flyer! opened long at 1.9687. Overnight, it was as high as 9711, then fell back. Today, just after the BOE rate announcement, Flyer! opened short at 9664. So although it moved 20-odd pips in profit overnight, it didn't preserve any profit by exiting at 9689 for example, as it moved south.  
  
Currently, I'm still in my original long position; float is **-$1,200.00.**

MM, the profit has to exceed about 28 pips before it will preserve any kind of profit. Interesting enough, mine entered at 1.9682 and the price topped out at 1.9711 on my charts, which was 29 points. Thus when the price came down it got out at 1.9684 with 2 pips profit.  
  
I had to put some kind of a value on this part of the EA and 28 pips came out to be about right because anything less and it was always jumping out early, too much more and profits turned to losing positions. Again, its a balancing act.

Marci,  
  
Does the "gapsize" parameter make a difference? I increased mine to 15. Are you using zero?

Gapsize is controlled by GapArray in your arrays... Gapsize will be overwritten by what ever you have in your array.

These are the settings I'm using. Flyer finally did go short, but it never exited the long. It's now in both positions. Here's also a pic of what it did. Seems like the short entry is a couple bars late. Any help is appreciated.

StopLossVal=58

These settings look fine, as long as you have kept the settings in the Arrays as I gave, everything is as it should be. Only difference is probably the broker. I'm using IBFX. Your chart I believe showed somebody else?...  
  
Also, since your position didn't reach the 28 point threshold of profit, either, the MA's going back down crossed too late for the EA to catch any profit. Mine only got out with 2 pips profit because my position hit the 28 point level.

I haven't touched the arrays at all. Shouldn't the first position have exited?

Marci,  
  
Mine went long at 1.9679, didn't sell at the correction, then stopped out at 1.9632 with the news. Is it my settings, maybe?  
  
Thanks, Dan

Gids, BenQ,  
  
Flyer did exactly what it was programmed to do in this case. Unfortunately, it was a case that left it in a losing position even after being up some. I know you say, "I could have cashed that 20 points out.."  
  
But an EA can't say that necessarily... On small profit margins, like this one, if the price reverses too quickly, it won't be able to get out soon enough to take a profit. As I said to MM, there is a 28 point buffer zone from the entry price to the highest profit level. If it never exceeds that level, it may or may not exit at a profit depending on how the signals go.  
  
Besides the crossing of the MA and MA3 lines, the slope of the tunnel EMA's also has to be flat or opposite trending as well for the general exit condition to succeed.  
  
I wish I could explain all this a little clearer, but the exit/entries for the EA are pretty complicated to explain.  
  
But, suffice to say, it did what it was supposed to do. The EA can't be perfect in every situation... there are a zillion possibilties, I can't program them all.

Ok. I didn't care about cashing in that 20 points. I'm in for the bigger moves. I was just concered that it did not close the long position when it opened the second short and thought there might be an error there. And also that the short seemed to be a late entry. The long has since stopped out. I'll keep watching. Thx.

My thoughts exactly. I understand the long term notion of this EA. When you mentioned how yours had closed the long, then created a short, I thought mine was reacting differently somehow. I have had it up and running for a couple of days and thought it would see the same, or similar setups.

Hm,  
  
same here... Flyer opened long yesterday, since when I moved stop few pip lower (below support level). On the chart it was still saying "Open Orders Exists" but at night it opened short, without closing previous long.  
In the code I see if statement that should've prevented this, but not sure why it didn't happen.  
I'll dig into it little more, and will see if there is some bug...

No bugs, it is allowed to be both long and short at the same time

Oh, that makes sence then. That if statement was to check if we have open position in given direction... So there can be 2 simultaneous positions, but in different directions, not the same one. Right?

MinVal is used if you don't want to let the EA trade if the account equity drops below the value set in MinVal... Useful to keep your account from being drained completely.

Make sure all your margin settings are correct and check your journal tab on MT4 and see if any errors are happening. If you still can't figure it out, send me your settings and I will look at them.

Traders and Traderettes,  
  
I was comfortable with and understood the explanation that my trade, which opened long at 84, didn't get 28 pips in profit in order to preserve some profit before closing the long and executing the short.   
  
Then I read Gids post where the trade opened long at 79 so it _should_ have: captured at least 28 pips, closed the long on the retrace; captured 2-3 pips profit on that close; and opened a short from that point. But it didn't and that seems rather arbitrary.  
  
So do we care to understand what happened in this case? Can we explain away this discrepancy by pointing to individual trading platforms? Or did I miss this explanation?   
  
Comments?

Marci,  
  
I have downloaded history files from alpari. I have gone thru the various steps to install them properly on MT4 and run the period converter. What variable setting shoud I use. Should the Period be "M1" or "M15". I know I have to change the inputs in Expert properties for each individual pairs I test. How do I achieve 90% modelling quality?  
  
Thanks,

If he used a different platform than you it would explain the difference in entry price, his 79 versus your 84. Also his platform could have a different spread than yours. If it only went up 28 pips on your platform it probably only went up 28 pips on his platfrom, but to a different price than yours.

You're correct. Looking closely at the chart gids' posted, it shows price reached approx 9706 and didn't peak at 9711 like other platforms such as mine, Marci's and benQ's.

Just read through the whole thread and there are some pepole who have asked questions that deserve to be pushed off a cliff.  
  
GirlFlyer, I dont know how you put up with all this demand and at times idiocracy ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1). Good Luck and a job well done with the EA.  
  
Saaedb  
  
P.S: if you can have someone in here make a new thread and post all your EA versions and all your settings in there, with no discussions. I think it will help reduce alot of rookie quesions. Just my 2 cents.

MM,  
  
I use StrategyBuilderFX platform. It has a 5 pip spread. Interesting, I really didn't think it would matter much, but platform questions seem to come up a lot. I'm opening a live account with IBFX to support EA trading, which seems to be the one of the more popular for MetaTrader. On your earlier post, and I believe Marci and everyone would agree, we must always be checking ourselves to ensure we are getting it as good as possible. Marci has done a tremendous job, without complaint, in making Flyer! one of the best EAs available. It's the least we can do to provide feedback.  
  
Many thanks friend, Dan

You need to have Metatrader4 installed on your computer.

I know this is really a silly issue that I am having, but I of course I do have MT 4 installed. I thought a .tpl file is just a template file, but what why wouldn't I be able to "read" it? Or better yet where are you opeing the file?  
  
Thanks

Marci,  
  
I have not been able to get Flyer to open any eurusd trades. I'm using the following set file. It works fine on gbpusd. A gbpusd trade opened just after NFP was released, but no trade on eurusd. There are no errors in the journal. I'm trading fixed lots. And ideas?

There was no eur position opened after the news this am. Is your margin setting the same for all pairs. I noticed it is set to 100. I think it has to be set to 200 for a mini account. Your minival is set for 1000. I don't recall what the value of your demo account , but if it is close to $1000 or less than a $1000 trades will not trigger. Minival is the minimum trading account value at which the EA will stop trading.

When did you first start running the program, the last eur/usd trade my EA opened was 12/7 at 15:02.

I placed in on a eurusd chart probably right after that time. I was just concerned that a position did not open after NFP as the pice action on the template looked suitable.

I had a gbpusd trade that opened right after NFP. It went as high as about 85 pips, and then turned around and slowly drifted back until it stopped out at -58. I thought when it went over 28 it was supposed to capture a least some of the move?

BenQ,  
  
That's my understanding also. Marci has clearly done a great job with this EA, so good that it seem that this is the only real issue we need to focus on - capturing some profit in the event of a reversal.  
  
Curious Ben, did the hedge open to the downside?

I believe that the capturing of some PIPs is depend upon what you set the values for UseTS and TrailingStopLevel. The default is not to use Trailing Stop. I have just left these values as is, and I have seen very profitable trades turn sour when the market starts reversing. What would be great is if one does not turn on UseTS then at least activate a B/E if its beyond x-number of PIPs as an option so that you don't lose anything.

I wasn't using TS at all. I was very surprised that it was up approx 85 pips and then slowly turned around and stopped out for -58. I'm not sure if that's an error or a setting or what, but that's a good amount of pips to give up.

Today was not a good day for the EA since the market reversed several timesin the course of the day. I am not sure because of NFP and the latter news....

Mine did open a short on the first reversal at about 1.9680 before the big drop and opened 2 long positions on the ride up. I was closing positions on the EA before the weekend because I was off to a holiday party, so I cheated on the 2nd long and took it when it maxed out so I don't know what would have happpened had it stayed in on the long side. However as it stands, I profited (in my demo only, sigh...) close to 250 pips both going up and down. But for those of you that got stopped out on your long from the initial ride up, I took a look at the code, because it shouldn't have allowed that to happen, and I discovered a bug in the code that prevented it from putting a S/L at +15pips profit as it was supposed to once the profit exceeded 55 pips. I WILL fix that over the weekend and update Flyer! with that fix along with one in the LimitHours function.  
  
Have a good weekend all!  
  
GF

What effects have been seen with trading during the Asian market times? I see on the software that these times can be removed from trading.   
  
How has trading during this time period affected the overall return on trading?  
  
Is it best to let the software run 24x7 or to eliminate certain hours from trading completely?

I just got mysqlf InterbankFX demo, and downloaded all data back from '99.  
Result I've got - totally unpredictible. Backtesting with same parameters, comparing to FXDD demo, produced more trades, entry and exit points were up to 20 pip apart, and in the end I've got two mirrired curves for results (FXDD - up, IBFX - down)  
That's so weird... I'm starting forward-testing it with IBFX, and see what'll happen...

If you used the download button in history center, the data is from metaquotes not the IBFX data.  
  
Hope that helps.

Then it's even more weird.  
Coz I used "download" button for both, IBFX, and FXDD.  
So data should be the same? Or FXDD uses some other source?

Backtesting has shown some limited improvement by eliminating the Asian session, but I don't see much difference. Since the price moves recently have not been that large during Asia, it might stand to do better to take them out and only trade during Europe and NY, thereby eliminating the smaller and possibly more false signals. But at the same time I've seen a trend start around 3 or 4am GMT and just continue that way right into Europe. So if you eliminated Asia, you could miss potential starts. Best thing to do is just try to test it and see how you feel it fares for you.

Every broker probably will have slightly different figures for their data...

Is there a way to get my MT show the GMT time? Its always confusing. I do notice during live trading that the Asian market will move during a specific time and then go to sleep, but I think its a sleeper since never tell for sure where price is heading since it ranges too much in my opinion.

You can't get MT4 to show it by itself... maybe I can write something into Flyer! to show it in the screen.
