Here is my system my friends all want to get their hands on.

I call it My Market Order System and it's just that.

It's been making me profits for some time and I hope it does the same for you.

This is what you need:

1) 3 Level ZZ Semafor Indicator... That's It !

**_THE RULES FOR UP TREND_**

1) Only Trade The Daily Charts

2) Ensure You Have A Nice Trend

3) _ALL TRADES ARE MARKET ORDERS_

4) Place Your STOP LOSS UNDER The **GREEN DOT** After It Closes

5) Place Your **BUY STOP ORDER** 10 Pips Or So Above The GREEN DOT

6) Keep Moving Your Stop UP Every 50 or So Pips

7) Close The Trade When A PINK or **RED DOT** Appears.

That's It !

Thanks Bob for sharing this. But how do you ensure a nice trending market? Do you use moving average to do that?

To check to see which way the market is trending...  
eg: BULLISH MARKET:  
Open you 4H Chart and see if it making it's way up.  
Do the same on the Daily and to confirm check the Weekly Chart too.  
If they are all trending upwards this would be an UP TREND....  
The chart above is a UP TREND...  
If it is a DOWN TREND just look for the opposite signs..

Hi Thanks for your system, looks interesting, but i'm a bit confused as your chart shows you using the pink dots for trading but your explanation talks about the yellow dots. Would be good if you could show some more examples  
  
many thanks

On lower timeframes it normally repaints.....but I doubt it would do so on daily!

Hi ukmartini I do use the PINK & YELLOW markers the YELLOW or #3 are the stronger indication of the next move.  
I suppose it can repaint that's why I use Market Orders. That way if it does reverse there is no loss because the trade would not have been triggered.  
  
Another way you could use it is wait for an Engulfing candle in the opposite direction after the pink or yellow marker.  
Best idea is test it on a demo account till you fine tune it to your own liking.   
Cheers !

It moves with the market, which it's designed to do... some call it repainting.... excellent indicator, can be a bit heavy on the cpu with multiple charts.

There is a couple of things I forgot to mention ...  
I NEVER trade on a sideways trend...such as the AUDJPY at the moment.  
Also if you download the Semafor it may show a light brown indicator, change this to BLACK, so it dows not show on your chart background.  
Cheers !

Hi Bob Howson. Your Trade Explorer results look impressive but looking closer your average losing trade is -16%. Is this your normal account risk? If it is then do you think it will get a margin call fairly soon? 

Gone to a better place

impressive indeed....but i second your opinion: trading daily charts (as the thread starter said) and using such high leverage that 10 pips mean 10% of account.....there is only one way it can go.  
  
and by the fact that TE has gone...i think it has already happend ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Guys,  
  
I think, Bob got stopped out in his account and that is why, his trade explorer is detached, as i remember, there was -76% return and the trade were still running.  
  
By the way, Its not a good system in my view because of largest draw-down, I would stay away from these kinds of systems, but maybe, thread starter have done some mistakes in his account and maybe you lose his account because of mistake, Just wondering and waiting for the thread starter to explain.

Hi Everyone,  
I made the big mistake of being too greedy and using too big of an investment in my trades and could ride the losses.  
I'm endeavouring to regain my losses, might take a week or so.....  
But I'm still sticking with this system....

Hey Bob,  
  
Thank you for updating the post!  
  
Few questions, Hope you wouldn't mind to answer them.  
  
\- If immediately we exit from the trade and the dot would repainted, so would we delete our next pending order also?  
\- If the dot is not disappeared but not reached to the execution level in 24 hours (1 Day), so would we delete it or we will wait for the market to touch the level?

Thanks for sharing but on your 2nd picture as you said exit when the pink dot appear and you have marked as 270 pips profit. I think the red dot was appeared earlier than what you marked on your picture as the dot is repainting.

Hi mario, the red dot ( SELL Signal ) did appear earlier that's why you MUST wait for the close of that candle before entering the SELL trade. Then you place your SELL Stop Order 10 or so pips underneath the CLOSED candle.  
Cheers !

Good Morning wahaj, if the trade has not executed leave your Market Order in place. Sometimes it may take a few days for the order to execute and I've NEVER known for this not to happen.

If the dot is moved to lets say another bar high, so would we adjust our pending order according to the closing level of repainted signal bar?

Your right on the mark there, wahaj. But I've never had that happen to me so far and I've been using this system for around 6 months now.

Hi Orid,  
Yes !   
I would close this trade at the CLOSE of this candle.  
Then place your Stop under the PINK Dot then place your BUY Order 10 pips above the top  
Also download the other Semafor and template I have on this page, it is much better.  
It will give you the GREEN for BUY & RED for SELL, instead of the yellow dot.  
Regards,  
Bob

Another way you could trade this pair Orid after you close the trade, is place a SELL STOP ORDER under the pink indicator and wait for it to come back down which it will. I don't think it will climb that much at this stage I feel it will drop much further before it continues to resume it's up trend. It will need to hit it's pivot point first, which would be the GREEN Dot.

Bob just trying to get this right .  
  
So you dont close as soon as the new disc appears, you wait till the end of the candle which is quite a few hours away?  
can the new disc dissappear in the mean time so you would leave the trade open , or can the new disc dissapear if pa reverses?  
Regards Peter  
ps thanks for updated semafor

Regards Peter

Hi Bob  
  
I like your ideas very much as I don't like scalping  
  
What I'm looking at is using Heikin Ashi candles and taking a trade after the yellow dot and then a change in colour. I think you will only enter the trade a bit later than your method, but hopefully it might be a more solid signal. I took two trades a few hours ago, a long on Eur/Usd and a short on Usd/Chf, I'll let you know how things work out.

Hello Bob,  
  
Your system is performing good in 2013 type market, because the market was too much trending on EU PAIR, but only on single pair, the draw-down is too big. You would need to trade 0.01 lot for $1000 account if you want to trade 10 pairs, or you can trade with 0.1 lot for $1000 account. That is not a final MM plan, you should change it according to your need. (Just a suggestion in the light of visual draw-down)  
  
I would like to inform you that the results are not impressive, especially in the market like 2006. Also be informed that these are the stats of EU Pair Daily Chart.

Hi PrinceWahaj,  
Im fairly new here so bear with me when I ask how you get such large minuses on hitting SL in your findings.  
when rules set by Bob say sl under dot which i think 50 - 60 pips then enter trade 10 pips other side of dot so stop loss shouldnt be more than 60 - 70 pips  
Please correct me if im wrong , heh i usually am . just trying to understand your backtests

Hello orid and bob,  
  
Correct me if i understood the rules wrongly.  
  
Entry and Exit rules:  
  
SELL: When the number 3 dot appears, if the dot was on the TOP, so we will take this candle's low + 10 pips more below for Sell Stop Order, and the SL would be above the DOT, and Closing of the trade will be on the first dot with closed candle of 2nd or 3rd number DOT depend on which one appears first.  
  
BUY: When the number 3 dot appears, if the dot was on the BOTTOM, so we will take this candle's high + 10 pips more above for Buy Stop Order and the SL would be below the DOT and Closing of the trade will be on the first dot with closed candle of 2nd or 3rd number DOT depend on which one appears first.  
  
@Orid that's why we have too much minuses, the dots repaints badly and that is the cause.  
  
Best Regards,  
PrinceWahaj

BUY: When the number 3 dot appears, if the dot was on the BOTTOM, so we will take this candle's high + 10 pips more above for Buy Stop Order and the SL...

I see what you mean PrinceWahaj.  
I think Bob needs to come in here and explain ,  
I may be wrong, but I thought we were to place order 10 pips below disc for sell with sl just above disc ,  
then if disc repaints higher order is not hit and you then move sell order up this way you keep stop loss to minimum usually around 40 pips.  
Makes good sense to me ,But I may be wrong.  
hopefully bob will set us straight.  
thanks for working on this Princewahaj all helps (280 pips today so far on this )![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f973.png?v=15.1)

Hello guy's  
  
Anyone got problem with repainting ?  
I mean indicator move with price, is hard to find and open position or i have only to wait and spend some time?  
What about using it with lower time frame? (4h and 1h)?  
  
Thank's and take care, Bob's thank's for sharing it !

Hi Orid  
I think you've had beginners luck, the ZZ can repaint at any time, so it is pretty risky entering where you have done, but you're only on a demo so doesn't really matter.  
  
I think Bob means to enter 10 pips above/below the candle where the yellow dot is.

Hey bob,  
  
Please read the previous posts and let us know the exact rules, we all are confused.  
  
Should we take the low of candle for sell trade or should we take the close of candle for sell? or Orid is correct in the rules?  
  
Best Regards,

Hi Guys ! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
Sorry if I have confused everyone, I have a habit of doing that sometimes.  
This is what I do with this trading system......  
But remember I'm only a newbie too and not an expert, so maybe between us all we can improve on this Semafor System.  
  
SELL TRADE: this would be the end of an RISING TREND  
Eg: Candle with RED DOT ( Or Yellow If You Wish )  
  
1) Place your SELL STOP ORDER at the BOTTOM of the CLOSED CANDLE 10 Pips Below If You Wish.  
2) Place your SL ABOVE the RED DOT  
  
So in other words the RED DOT is indicating us to SELL !  
The RED DOT will not move once this candle is closed UNLESS the next candle decides to go further UP.  
If it does move your SL ABOVE once again and move the SELL STOP ORDER Up also.

I think the idea of placing your SELL STOP ORDER under the dot may be a better idea.  
I will try this on the next up and coming trades...

Hey Bob,  
  
Now, no one will get confused. Thank you very much for explanation.  
  
You may find my older posts helpful in this topic, please have a look on back-tests, these are the verified back-tests by me, and if the person didn't have fear, he/she would took these all trades, and the results, you can see.

When they say repaints does that mean if in an up trend the DOT declines ?  
If so I've never had an issue.  
This is my latest trade below only placed it a few minutes ago...

Yes thats right  
  
Repainting is the dot moving after the candle has closed so on the chart you posted, if the Cad/Chf went lower than the candle with the green dot, it would repaint on to the new low candle.

Hi Bob , yes that is how I traded yesterday , I apologise as I caused the confusion , I misunderstood your post s 32 and 33 which to me reffered to the dots rather than candles , sorry for the misunderstanding.  
Mind you it worked very well ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f633.png?v=15.1)  
I managed 680 pips on closing today on the daily that was with a 35 pip trailing stop on two of them

Hello Bob and all user,  
  
I check this indicator and is awesome during daily chart but, if you got a lower time frame can you get a repaint, i mean if you got the yellow dot on top of the candle and market price move up the yellow dot move with it, same stuff if you got a first candle with yellow dot, at price 1,2000 for example, if the second candle got higher price like 1,2200 the yellow dot move on this candle, that's for me wanna mean repaint, or maybe i not understand what wanna mean it. However with lower time frame this indicator have some problem, but on daily chart appear very cool !  
Thank's for sharing.

Hi Hyperfire  
  
Looks like a valid set up to me  
  
I think we remove the brown signal as it is the weakest

Hi guys, USDCAD is a valid trade and your also on the money about the small brown dots, which are the weakest signal.  
It's upto you if you want to trade them.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Just something I've noticed is your pip value is different to mine. Right now my chart is reading 1.09242  
Just thought I'de mention it...  
Cheers back for some more zzzzzzz now ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f634.png?v=15.1)

Another lovely morning here in Oz, this candle is due to close in 2 hours or so.  
I have a pending SELL STOP ORDER in place below the current candle. I feel there will be some profit before week is out.

I think that you could help by using moving averages to understand the trend and be very careful when you go against it. I personally use three exponential moving averages 21-100-200 and a Strength Currency meter

Hello Hyperfire,  
  
Please don't take my words personal, i don't meant to hijack the thread. The system can be improved BUT!  
  
That is the reality of these kinds of system, Believe it or not, the draw-down is too big and without good MM plan or even weak MM plan, system can destroy full account, just like the year 2006 and 2007.  
  
I was also wondered when the thread starter posted his idea, then i cross checked each and every signal. Ofcourse past performance has nothing to do with future performance but still, it has some relation and it is the only way to know that if the system can be profitable in long run or not.  
  
I like the suggestion of Marred, we should not only rely on Semafor indicator because it will keep repaint the bars when there is a new high. If you need a non-repainting version, just let me know and i will be happy to post here, but for now, i don't want to disappoint the thread starter.  
  
Candlestick patterns can help us in understanding that if there can be a reversal or market will continue to move in one direction.  
  
I am not saying that just try and blow your account, i am just warning you guys because it can be done any time with you.  
  
Best Regards and Wish you a lot of green pips.

Hi Ukmartin,  
  
I started a few days ago and it seems a good system. The daily time frame is good to avoid false signals but you should always be very careful when we move against the trend. We can also use the correlations to ensure that the price goes in the desired direction

Hi Bob , please let me know if its ok to post these results, as I am entering on the bottom of the dot instead of candle , with remarkable results so far.  
seems less risk regarding SL as well .  
as you see on this chart I would only just be entering if it was on candle , yet trade is already up45 pips, I will keep trading this way and post the results if you dont mind?

Well done Orid  
  
It does seem a risky idea, but you seem to be doing well, how many trades have you taken and have they all been winners.  
  
Are you only entering in the direction of the trend, or either way?

Hi guys. Allow me to add my 2 cents to how I trade the semafors. I use 4 timeframes. 15M 1H 4H and D. For buy signals I look for a strong green semafor forming on the 4H or D charts. I like to line up the semafor with a support level. I look for a semafor to appear on the 15M chart and I buy at the close of that semafor candle on the 15M chart. I set my stop below the 15M semafor candle. Its usually about a 10-20 pip stop. This has a LOT less drawdown. If the semafor on the 15M chart holds and price moves up, I move my stop to break even when a red semafor appears. I continue to do this until the 4H or D Semafor candle holds.   
  
Exiting is a little different. I don't use the semafors to exit as I like to cut my losers short and let my winners run. semafors repaint so I set a target and put a takeprofit there. I like to raise my stop as it moves up...I do this with price action.

Hi Martin , im from uk also west midlands moved to aus 34 yrs ago.  
any way I gave up on ,"the trend is your friend" (now you think im crazy heh?) unless very strong.even so the one im in now i posted is looking good  
being fairly new may I ask why you think its more risky/ I thought less risky as stop loss is much less and is a fixed amount,  
and i try to enter at least 20 pips after the dot so a little momentum  
My results are remarkable to say the least but early days maybe after 6 months may be better indication . or at least 6 weeks .  
13 trades but very messy as ive been trying different things instead of sticking to bobs rules  
eg at least 5 have hit a trailing stop or a BE +5   
One trade au us put on by mistake on H4 which i closed at - 20 ( went on to win and stiil going )  
1 other is on last post gb/ us also entered by mistake on H4 doh - 26 at mo but i think will come good   
the thing is most of the trades have gone on if id stuck to bobs rule of 50 pip stops.  
Ive also tried quite a few of the other systems here very intensely on ff and never had such promising results .from the start

Some advice here please guys ,  
I think if im gonna post my results I should keep to most of Bobs rules , 50 pip stops, close on new disc ,and stick to the enter on disc + 20 pips (not in BOBS rules)  
bare chart , + semafor  
no ma or resistance levels.  
really simple  
With bobs permission of course  
any suggestions appreciated?  
  
if good after next week ill go on my live account.

Hi Peter  
  
West Midlands to Australia, I know which one I would prefer, and it's not here lol  
  
The reason I thought it was risky to enter so soon is because the change if direction isn't really confirmed and the dot can repaint, but I must say that so far I haven;t seen the daily big dot repaint yet, don't know if anyone else has?

Yes the 3 semafor will repaint if price carries on. I saw it repaint twice on UsdCad, the 3 semafor appeared 2 bars back. I adjusted the sell stop order each day.  
  
Also, here is an interesting one for you on AudUsd, my sell stop was triggered under the 2 semafor, trailing stop and a 3 semafor appeared 3 days later so I have a buy stop order in place, if it does not trigger today I will adjust it to the moving semafor.

showing my inexperience here. but  
Why is it such a big deal with some people because an indicator repaints ? not you norm .  
I really think its an advantage in some cases , at least a repainting indi is being honest by saying look i was wrong price, isnt reversing here after all but may reverse further up here , ahem if you know what I mean.  
where as a non repainting indi will say enter here and thats the end of it .   
now to get my butt kicked by you nice people.

Hi Norm  
  
Personally I wouldn't enter on a level 2 signal (pink) as they are not as strong. I am in a long on Aud/Usd from yesterday, I thought it might repaint a few minutes ago, but it held, so it might go up now.

The way I figure it is, if you place your BUY STOP ORDER above a GREEN Dot which is a BUY signal.  
If it repaints the trade would not be triggered. So all you would need to do is readjust your entries.  
For example in the current AUDUSD pair at the moment.  
With this system patience is very important, remember :nerd:  
Also I don't mind if we all can improve on this system so do a bit of experimenting. I would love to read the different ways you trade with it.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Hi Martin,  
I had a BUY Stop Order in @ 0.82744 and at the moment I'm around only 4 pips in profit. I reckon this trade will run into next week or so with profits.

Hi Bob  
  
I hope your right it's not looking like it wants to go up yet, but on the other hand it has tried and failed to go down and this area has been a previous reversal point.  
  
this is my first trade with your system, so would be nice to make a few pips

G'day Martin, just woke up feeling peckish ready for a 3 o'clock snack...lol !  
This time of the week the markets start to slow and they have pulled back on a few trades I have.  
I'm up around 21 pips on the pair as I write.  
I'll be checking all my trades just before the market closes, which is 9am my time.  
Back to get a few more zzzzz  
Have a great weekend.

Guys   
  
Im interested .......would a scanner help at all  
  
My platform has 55 swaps what if I managed to get a scanner written that at the end of each day would tell you any swap that had a 3 ball in fixed position ?  
  
You could then just zoom in on the swaps indicated or I could then get an EA to write out the orders taking its info from the scanner output ?   
  
I dont mind getting it built and posted here ..it cannot be used for back testing due to repaint issues but with 55 swaps and run on demo it will give a good indication to its viability  
  
What you all think ??

Hi Bob  
  
Before I try and do this ...especially as it may be posted here if people want it do you me doing it,this is your thread  
  
Would it help ?  
  
It can list all swaps,any time frames but primarily daily and 4 hour ??  
  
And indicate 3 ball in place only or 2 ball as well ??  
  
End of day will be midnight GMT ??  
  
Would you like any other variables built into the indicator which can be changed by the user ??  
  
Cheers   
  
Paulus

Hello guys,  
  
I noticed much talk about repainting of the Semafor. Here is an alternative indicator that does not repaint. So, it can be used for backtesting.  
You have to adjust settings, colors and dot sizes before using it.  
Cheers!

Ive just put the none repainting semaphor on my chart and compared just the biggest swing signals which are the circles with 3 in on the repainting version  
  
I looked at August to current date on CADCHF Daily and got the following results  
  
NT means there was a 3 ball but no trigger the next day ....the pips value is the max any triggered trade went to ,so is not the actual number of pips you would of gained  
  
NT NT 173 NT -47 NT 292 NT 121 NT NT 268 NT NT NT NT NT NT -64 NT -79 and then the last signal is the one hi lighted on the CADCHF chart daily which triggered Friday  
  
So the sequence is 173 -47 292 121 268 -64 -79  
  
Maximum movement pips gained but not achieved 664  
  
Using the type of stop I personally use on daily charts I get 89 -47 215 30 198 -64 21= + 353 pips  
  
Which I think is great for 1 swap plus we have gained a winner going from-79 to +21   
  
Strike rate over that 6 month period 71% which again short time test but healthy figures  
  
Now add in all the majors ...... looks very promising

Hi Paulus  
  
Thanks for that testing, the results look promising, I've been having a think about this system myself over the weekend and thought it might be a good idea that after getting the signal on the daily timeframe, we drop down to the H1 and then look for a pullback and then enter in the direction from the D1.

Hi, I would place the BUY Stop just above the candle, but only AFTER the candle is or about to CLOSE.

Many of your signals seem to be wrong, maybe you have the colours or settings wrong.

I posted the non repainting indicator for the purpose of backtesting if someone wants to do it. As I mentioned, it needs adjustments - the color and size of dots is changeable.  
It is easy to figure out visually, which dots are which, to match it with ordinary Semafor: grey is Semafor1, green is Semafor2 and red Semafor3. Basically, you need only red for entries and green for exits.  
In inputs you can adjust how far the dots are from candles.

I think this style of trading can be profitable. What attracts me to it the most is the fact that it is trading off the daily chart. I work a full time job so I'm unable to trade during the day. The daily chart is right up my alley so I'm curious to see how this thread turns out.   
  
Thanks to all those who are contributing and sharing their ideas.  
  
Paulus, I think your idea of creating an EA to notify us of the 3 ball is great. I'm not great with converting GMT to my time (PST) so I request if possible that you allow the EA to have an option to change the time that the scan begins. I trade with [Oanda](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile") so I get a new daily candle at 9pm PST, which works well for my situation. So if you could add an option for the user to choose the time the scan is done that would be great.

ok will include time variable when i send off the details  
  
If short i would enter 1 pip below the low of the 3 balls candle..the 3 balls would be on top of the candle  
  
here s the current signal on CADCHF

Daily  
4Hr  
1Hr scanner  
  
Also a time variable for broker time and start of new candle  
  
This will be an indicator that sits on a chart that updates once for daily 8 times for 4 hour charts 24 times for hourly charts  
  
I will get the ind to pick 2 ball as well as 3 ball as a variable  
  
And I will get a complete list of swaps listed as variables ,so you should be able to follow 3 ball on daily on just EU or all swaps over 3 time frames over to balls by adjusting parameters in the indy  
  
This is a picture of a scanner that was built for me a couple months ago for something entirely different but works well ,this new scanner will look similar and sits on a blank chart.  
If results are good the scanner can send orders via an EA for auto operation if we think its warranted

apologise if this has been covered by as Bob states trading with the trend is the best eg in down trends a weak rally followed by a strong down move   
  
But I have noticed using 3 ball only you need to look way back to get a feel for the trend as shown on the screen shot  
  
With the 2 ball albeit this may be risker ?? ( I dont know) we can see you can def pick out the trend and trade the 2 balls accordinly

Just read the whole thread. You know, this method could easily lend itself to an EA - its so mechanical, should work wonderfully. Especially if you're not always at the charts - like me. Wish I could test it out but unfortunately coding seems as complicated as brain surgery to me lol!  
  
Anyone else here keen to give it a bash?

Il get the scanner done 1st the Ea will follow if we all think its viable..and primarily need to run it past Bob 1st   
  
I have a guy that codes for me that Ive found to be very good and professional once Ive written the rules for the scanner it normally takes 3-5 days to get it done I will then post it here for all to use

Many thanks Paulus you are a legend ,  
Im trading at the mo only in direction of no 3 ball eg if a 3 ball buy signal, enter , then out at next pink or no 3   
if a second pink forms re enter in same direction as original no 3.  
well hope that makes sense can hardly understand it myself lol ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f608.png?v=15.1)l   
Regards Peter

I exit slightly differently still use opposing dot but then move dot accordingly  
  
Ideally I like to risk 5% on every trade so take entry to stop loss and calculate 5% of bank then take TP at 2 x 5% so winners are 10% losers 5% RR of 2;1  
  
Advantage over existing exit is that if you have a large entry bar and lose say 60 pips then you have 3 winners on a small entry bar of 15 pips each even though you have 3 winners and 1 loser you still end up losing  
  
An EA im running on another system looks at the account and automatically calculates 5% and uses that figure it does that for every trade so all trade are equal regardless of pip size also if I then take a trade on another swap with a different pip value then the EA will also convert that to 5% of the account so all trades no matter what size the bars over all swaps are equal  
  
Not sure if can be implemented here Il take a look

Nice im looking not trading the system atm  
  
the more I look the more jumps out to my already said by Bob  
  
To trade the trend results in fewer attempted failed trades  
  
If a swap is heading down then the semaphor will keep trying to pick the bottoms ..this can results in several failed trades before the actual bottom goes in  
  
So if a swap trend for a couple weeks things could get hairy on the account front,in a chop market then the system I think comes into its own which is normal the reverse for every other system out there....the big question is when are we in chop and when are we about to trend...we can narrow that down I think  
  
Look at the circles given by the none lag indy trying to pick bottoms in down trend now compare that to the circles going with the trend ..they almost pick every retracement

Hi Guys, everything is going great guns here and it looks like we are all doing well.  
Yesterday I had this idea of trying to bank 100 pips each day. So I'm setting my targets at only 30 pip lots which seems very easy to do with this system. So if I'm trading 5 pairs I will try and get 39 pips for each pair, so far so good.  
  
Also someone wrote about keeping track of your trades, I have uploaded a file I use which may be helpful.

Currently I'm in a micro account and it seems that a Volume of 0.5 = $0.50 per pip & 0.10 = $1.00 per pip and so on....

Good thread Bobhowson, I'm in ! Thanks for sharing.  
  
Will demo with the following tweak: I will take all 4H signals in line with the daily yellow dot, meaning that if we have last yellow dot on top, I will take only short signals on 4H. Hope that makes sense. Right now, I have pending sell on AUDCAD and EURCAD and pending long on CADJPY.   
  
Cheers.

Interesting strategy ... my thoughts  
  
1\. D1 ... green or red ball  
2\. in w1 ... draws a channel with balls (you give the trend)  
3\. enter D1 <==> there ball in W1 (no matter the color or size)  
  
example...  
buy.............. eur-usd, eur-jpy, fco-jpy, cad-jpy, eur-nzd, gbp-nzd  
sell.............. silver, aus-cad

Bob can I ask is your SL set to 30 also .. ?  
  
If it is then have you looked at % staking ie risk 5% on each trade  
That way the bank grows exponentially and the risk is always 5% with a simple EA you make make sure even with different swaps having diff pip values each and every trade will only risk 5% or 3% or wat ever you choose.  
  
I have it built into my other EA's and removes the need to do basic calculates when trading the same system across various swaps

sorry, I didn't understand well the entry:  
is it 10pips above/below number 3 ball or the high/low of the candle of the number 3 ball or the close of the candle of the number 3 ball ?  
  
because the main rule on the first page says just above/below number 3 ball, but then other people on the thread says candle high/low or close ...  
I'm just confused.

For me the best entry is 10 pips above or below the candle closed with the ball because sometimes the order does not start and the ball moves on the next candle without taking the stop loss

Ok here is the screen shot of the dashboard I want the coder to produce,swaps down the left then 1hr 4 hr and daily 2 and 3 ball with simple colour boxes .Red box means that ball is present and is looking for a short visa versa for green ball.Blank sqaure means no balls present  
  
Present in Indicator that user can change  
  
Broker time  
GMT offset time  
Colour of boxes  
  
  
Things like what swaps to trade and what hours and balls to look for will be in the EA if we get that far,also for the 1hour 2 and 3 balls you may wish certain sessions  
  
Any other info you think the dash board should have let me know .. In Future versions I want a box showing trending swaps defined by definite rules for example .Then if a tick is in that particular parameter in the indicator and you see a red box on the 4 hour is then you will know its also defined as in down trend.  
  
Any suggestions or changes Il hold open for 48 hrs before sending off

hi friends  
  
Continuing with the post 153  
  
this strategy has potential, but needs some filters because the balls repaint.  
  
observe the cad-jpy, the ball has moved ... for example could use the gann 10 in D1... it is just an idea

green ball I do not know if Blue Cross was placed  
  
we would have had a small loss compared to the previous potential gains  
  
you remember that w1 gives the trend

Hi all  
  
I hope everyone is making some pips with this system, I know I am![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
So far it looks pretty solid to me, I like Porfiro's idea of drawing the trend lines on the weekly.  
  
I haven't had a loosing trade yet even when I got in too early, I've been as much as 100 pips in the red, but the next day the trade turned around and went into profit.  
  
My only issue is because I am used to short term trading I exit my wins too soon, but I think that will come with more confidence.  
  
Martin

I think less or rare trades if you only go with the weekly trend direction, cuz obviously we are trading the daily tf.

yes, it is safer to follow the weekly trend ... simply connecting the previous balls, no longer will move

I haven't had a loosing trade yet even when I got in too early, I've been as much as 100 pips in the red, but the next day the trade turned around and went into profit. My only issue is because I am used to short term trading I exit my wins too soon, but I think that will come with more confidence. Martin

Great stuff Martin , im having similar result ,  
I really like how simple this system is ,  
May i ask are you entering on candle or more aggressive on disc??  
as you say it seems pretty solid as it is , maybe best not to complicate it too much

I have sent the information required to the coder to make the dash board as outlined in my earlier post.When its completed I will post it here for all to use and evaluate  
  
Changes can be made as required and on request if we think its worth it  
  
I have been studying the 5min with the semaphore indicator ,its viable but requires 2 filters in my opinion  
A filter to take only signals with the current trend and a filter to filter out some of the false signals caused by repainting  
  
I used my 5% risk and 15% return on every signal  
  
IE .. Risk 5% on every signal (entry to SL calculated at 5% of account balance)  
Target ( TP) set at 3 x the risk = 15%  
Every loser loses 5% every winner wins 15% hence 3:1 RR  
  
On the 10 swaps I tend to follow we had 5 swaps each triggering 1 signal,5 swaps triggering no signal  
4 Winners at 15%  
1 loser at 5%  
  
This is a great overall gain on the account but its only for today as the back testing is done manually and its slow but its a positive outcome not a negative Il post a chart of a signal in a few mins

Thanks for your effort here! Will you be showing what time frame you are using in your demo? FYI I have started trading this on the H4 chart since Wed. this week and I have 2 live trades going with very small lots. I want to get used to the mechanics of how the #3 indicator repaints and which candles I want to use to set the entry and SL. I have noticed that some of the candles which get marked by the #3 bubble can be a little small for my liking. So in those cases, I am looking at the previous 2-3 candles and using their highs and lows as the possible entry and SL values. Some people in this thread seem concerned in taking counter trend trades but I think if you were to look at these trades over a long term, I think they will turn out to be profitable. Lets keep this one going ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

in m5 with semaphore it is very difficult .... be careful friend  
  
  
  
  
in the D1 with trend of W1 you can make many pips  
  
look at the movement of the bb and the balls in w1 ... then go to d1 and looking for entries for example

An unusual swap but a nice signal..this is what the dash board could find scanning 50 odd swaps looking for this type of set up..updating every 5mins for example or hourly etc etc

Hi Tiggrrr.  
  
I have been putting a trailing stop of 5-10 pips on as soon as a trade shows a new disc against me , I haven't monitored it to see if its worth it or just to pull out at new disc but at least you keep most profits , with a chance it will go on .

So I'm setting my targets at only 30 pip lots which seems very easy to do with this system. So if I'm trading 5 pairs I will try and get 39 pips for each pair, so far so good. Also someone wrote about keeping track of your trades, I have uploaded a file I use which may be helpful.

Hello Bob , first of all thank you very much for introducing me to this fantastic indicator and then so I'm sorry for my English because I'm not native speaker , I'm Italian . I have slightly modified your rules considering the maximum and minimum of candles including the shadows rather than closures to put orders . I always add spread over 10 pips and doubling the pips for the stop loss bringing to 20 plus the spread . Of course when the order does not start and the ball moves to the new candle at the end of the day I move the order accordingly. If an order starts and touch the stop loss at the end of the day I reposition a new order increasing it a little be, ie from 0.02 to 0.04 , 0.06 in the case of new stop and I think while controlling trends do not happen to have more than three consecutive losses often also because the ball moves without touch the order. I use some moving averages to help me understand the trend and I use a channel to see if the price is in overbought or oversold area . Thanks again I'll keep you updated on the results.  
  
good trading ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Hello Paulus  
  
What is the dotted line on your 5 min chart?  
  
By the way the retracement level shown on your chart is actually 38.2 not 62.8  
  
And thank you for taking the time to experiment and improve this method. I know you are a capable system developer.

Hi Howard its an indy called nonelagdot and it doesnot repaint, once the bar is complete the colour is fixed it stays ......on 5min I use setting 144...I always try to use Fib numbers on anything I use  
  
I also use a trading simulator you download it and place it in your EA file in Meta trader you can then load it and apply your template select start and end dates and play back that day or week in real time up to 30 times faster  
  
Ive also included that file

a few examples on the daily using same rules and principles as the 5min charts.  
Signals may be few and far between but with a scanner on 50 swaps there will be enough risk pickings  
  
There are losers but with 3;1 risk reward theres no need to worry the odds are in your favour here  
  
With a 1;1 RR or risk greater than TP then its a whole different story  
  
With 3;1 RR you can have 10 trades in a month lose 6 win 4 and still be up 30% that's a very nice monthly income if your trading with a large bank

Wow, it's so great to see people supporting each other like this. I know this might sound crazy but I feel that with support like that, we all can achieve our dreams and goals in this business. I feel that if you keep like minded people around yourself, the possibilities are endless. I've read the entire thread to get caught up on everything and I'm really liking what I have come across.  
  
Everybody is doing a great job contributing to the thread.   
  
I have a suggestion that may be used as a filter. Not sure if it's worthwhile but just something that popped in to my head as i was looking at the charts. I believe it will probably work best on the daily chart since on the smaller time frames price will move back and forth more often before picking a direction.   
  
My suggestion is if we have a 3 at a peak indicating a possible short move, instead of putting the limit order 10 pips below the location of the 3 ball maybe it will be more beneficial to put the limit order 10 pips below the low of the last bullish daily candle. Of course this would be vice versa for a possible long position.  
  
I understand that this may get us into trades a bit later than it would by putting the limit order 10 pips below the location of the 3 ball but I think it would help us stay out of the whipsaw situation. Of course if the daily candles are small because the last few days price has not moved much then we could end up in whipsaw situations also but this is just something I thought about as I was looking at the charts.  
  
I wanted to share my thoughts with the thread because I see everybody contributing and that is a great energy to have.  
  
As of right now I'm not demo trading this system just looking at the charts. I'm waiting for the EA to get created that Paulus is having done for us (thanks Paulus) so I can apply it to multiple charts and see how the system does from that point. My initial reaction to this system is that I think it has great potential and will be something that will put some green into our pockets.

Paulus,   
  
If you answered this already in a previous post, I'm sorry for asking again. I read that you stated you use 144 for the nonlag indy on the 5 minute chart. Can you please share what settings you use when applying the indy on the daily chart?

That's what I love most about this system. The higher time frame trading fits best for my schedule and just my view on how much I want to be in front of the charts. Trading off the weekly chart has been something that I have thought about in the past also.  
  
Traveling over the weekends sounds like fun. Not really in position to do that right now financially but I'm sure that will change over time.

I think you'll find it works best over the long time frames. When I originally started using this system I found it great with the Daily Charts, but now I've decided to trade the weekly. There is a post where someone has done the code I think.  
I like to keep it a simple as I can...

Would you be kind enough to share the indicator you've shown that plots the support/resistance areas of the weekly/monthly chart?

Well done Peter  
  
Just to confirm are you entering after the candle with the dot has closed?

> hi orid....i asked if the semafor indi repaints in 4hr chart??.....good to know this system works for you...how and when you enter the trade in so many pairs...do you have any alert system added to the chart to know the reversal.....info will be of immense use to fellow traders![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

sorryy I didnt answer your question earlier, the semafor repaints on any time frame as its meant too I think this is a good thing from what I see but I am a fairly new trader my experience is very limited although the success (so far) is very promising to say the least I dont believe Im qualified to answer too many questions , maybe ask our honourable leader Bob  
  
the two ways im entering is as follows'  
1\. enter only in direction of last no. 3 candle 30 pips or more below above disc ,  
2\. enter only in direction of last no. 3 candle 10 pips below candle.  
Thats it , no ma, no sup res levels , just plain chart, no alerts.pairs are as you see on my posted chart  
  
I did try ha candles seems to delay entries to much,   
hope this makes sense.

Yes Martin that is one way I'm trying .  
seems to work either way but candle close is probly safer if there is such a thing in forex.  
Live in next couple of days . then well see if i can keep up the confidence.  
how are you doing ? if everyone had entered today on the rules on p1 = pips lots

Yep Matin live is a different beast altogether,  
I try to leave the trade in untill a new disc appears ,then pull out or trail it.  
But like right this minute most of my trades are still in good profit but im off too bed shortly so what to do?  
So ive put trailing sl of 10 pips on all of them . Hard to know what to do.  
i did a 10 pip trail on us cad earlier when new disc appeared it hit stop but now has gone on another 20 pips or so, it still made 90 pips so should be very happy and not be greedy huh?

This just triggered on AUDUSD  
  
Now on the 5min I trade only 8am UK to 5pm UK we need the volatility on the 1 hr and 4hour it doesn't matter so much  
  
So this is a what if trade just to show the entry more than anything else

every one seems to be making good pips  
  
dashboard is with the coding guy and ive been told 3-4 days  
  
I will be building more onto it but its a start,Iwill also want 5min added as well as trades in line with the trending indy nonelag dot,and then pull backs to the fib 61.8 this especially removes alot of false signals  
  
Then it needs to handle money manegment  
  
how are you manually going to balance funds so all trades are equal when trading across 30 pairs ??  
  
You take trade on AUD/NZD and make 30 pips you make $195  
You take a trade on EUR/USD you lose 30 pips you lose $300  
  
Now measure your entry to stoploss use that figure and calculate 5% of your bank then multyply by 3 to get your 15% TP and also do the conversion of the $pip value.The EA can do all that seamlessly....you you need an edge to start with

Just an example.....blue box shows our interest area this is what the EA needs to zone into

currently im making pips trading this on the daily charts, simple and surprisingly effective, even with the disc repainting issues - which is not too bad on the daily charts  
  
dont have the time to trade this on the 4h charts though, an EA would be great to test this.... please can you keep us posted and let us know when roughly you will release it. ie are you going to preliminarily test it and then release or will you release for public testing straight away  
  
  
thanks

Hi Bob,  
  
Thanks for sharing your system. One question, please...Why have you named this your Market Order System? Market orders are _immediate_ , and we are placing _pending_ orders if I understand the process. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f615.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/2753.png?v=15.1)  
  
Keep up the good work!  
  
Great trading!

Ok I have the custom Indicator   
  
here is a view .. I had the guy add the weekly 2 and 3 ball also for Bob  
  
In the attachments below you will see Balls dashboard TPL load this as your template this will show a blank white chart to load the indy onto which is called Balls_ Dashboard  
  
Change colours as you see fit  
  
I will add the indys on next post as I want to keep it step by step..

ok here is a copy of the email sent to me by the programmer  
\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Hello,  
  
The dashboard is ready. I called it Balls_Dashboard, but I can change the name if needed.  
I also attached SemaphoreTrue2 where I changed default ball colors.  
  
All dashboard colors can be changed. By default there are set to look good on white background. I attached a template (balls_dashboard.tpl), which you can use to quickly remove everything from the chart and make it white. This is just for your convenience.  
  
If you see ‘Wait...’ in any box, it means that this chart has not been downloaded by Metatrader yet. It should disappear after some time. If not, you can open this chart manually. It will force it to update.  
  
  
I hope I understood everything correctly. Let me know if anything needs to be changed.  
  
\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
Mins is fine please let me know if you have problems and I will pass it on ,the only problem I had the ones posted below did not work because in my platform instead of EURUSD I have EURUSDpro ..so as the guy changed that for me it worked

Dont forget 1HRr updates on the close of the current 1 HR candle........ 4 HR on 4Hr candle ......etc etc  
  
If you want any swaps added gold silver etc let me know Im going to ask for 5min time frame to be added   
  
Other ideas each rectangle will be split in 2 for 2 colours green if balls on bottom for long but then green if Nonelagdot agrees or red if it agrees with short trend..so green red in a single box means counter trend trade green green in single box means trend long semaphore looking for long etc etc

Scroll down to strings and modify these to whatever the instruments are called on your platform, on GKFX , EURUSD is called EURUSDSB so should be modified to this. Once you are done, hit save .

Thank you very much Paulus! This is going to really help me tremendously. I wanted to keep track of more pairs and it was becoming hard for me so this is wonderful. I also love the idea of the two color boxes so one can know when we are in a counter trend or trending situation. That's a fantastic idea. I also would like to have the 5 minute time frame added like you stated.  
  
Once again, thanks so much for all your help. It's greatly appreciated.

Hi  
  
yes snap for me also my trading platform actually has 55 forex swap although some have massive 20 pip spread def ones just for the daily or 4 hour time frame I think  
  
For trading on the 5 min ive been looking at commission only brokers for this as thier spead on the swap will be zero  
This help on the 5mins greatly  
  
Take a classic signal your entry to stop loss is calculated at 6 pips and this will be calculated as 5% risk of account balance therefore your target is going to be 3 x 6 pips = 18pips which if it wins will be a 15% gain on account balance.  
  
But if you factor in the spread of say 3 pips then we need 18 pips + 3 = 21 pips and dont forget your not taken out as price hit your TP its when the bid or ask hits your TP depending on whether you are short or long  
  
On commision only broker as the price touches your TP you are taken out for a main $10 contract on EU cost is $18 which works out 1.8 pips ..we just don't take it into the calculation as normal  
  
Ther are also brokers that operate zero spread and only take thier commision if you win they take none for a losing trade,they also do mini and micro  
  
I thik its worth looking at  
  
On 1 hour 4 hour daily weekly etc the spread doesnt become an issue  
  
P

1st of all make sure your not just going down to N in your custom indy folder when you are looking it will not appear after M in the list it has an unserscore before it   
  
Its _nonelagdot so it will be placed at the top in the list mine is around 12 from the top  
  
You have placed it in the correct folder which is Metatrader - Experts - Indicaters otherwise it wouldnt appear on the chart I think   
  
Try that see if its thier

I have sent sent the coder another email requesting a V2 to the dash board this is purley for me and how I trade but will post here when its completed  
  
\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
Now id like to add a few things I have attached an indicator called _nonelagdot this is what I use to filter signals into up or down trends  
  
In the parameters if I can have Length and colours please  
  
In the screen shot you will see NLD   
  
If a 2 or 3 ball is on top and calling for a short if NLD is red then we have a short with trend situation  
  
If a 2 or 3 ball is on top and calling for a short if NLD is blue then we have a short with counter trend situation  
  
If a 2 or 3 ball is on bottom and calling for a long if NLD is blue then we have a long with trend situation  
If a 2 or 3 ball is on bottom and calling for a long if NLD is red then we have a long with counter trend situation  
  
In the dash board if we split each box with a black line and as an example the screen shot 1HR 2Ball on EURAUD shows  
  
green box telling that ball is on top and then red box telling NLD is red so this would be a counter trend situation  
  
On the same time frame but AUDCHF we have red box telling us red ball on top and then another red box telling us NLG also red so this is a with trend situation  
  
Can I also have a 5min box please  
  
Pease send me any questions

ok the new dash board is ready and I have included it below this uses nonelagdot to be the guide as for the trend  
  
Each box is now split into 2 green green means 2 or 3 balls on the bottom looking for longs and none lag dot looking for longs  
Visa veras for short red and green box means ball and none lagdot in counter trend position  
  
here is the email from the coder  
  
\-------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
Hi,  
  
The modifications are ready.  
  
  
  

  
\-------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
Ive just sent the coder an email asking if its nonelagdot or the 5min time frame that doing the damage  
  
I will post it here but unless you have a very fast and capable machine I think you will have problems...

The solution may be to run 2 x mt4 from the same broker if that can be done 1 just running the dashboard scanner the other for trading  
  
With an EA the CPU usage drops dramatically .. but for an EA we need proper entry and exit conditions I know how I want o enter and exit I just wanted to build one thing at a time  
  
I set my chart to load only 3000 bars

here is the reply from the coder  
  
I have attached the indicators ..just put them all in experts .. indicators nonelag dot 144 on daily 233  
  
\-------------------------------------------------  
  
Hi,  
  
I made a slightly faster version. I added MaxBars input parameter to both _nonlagdot and SemaphorTrue2. Both indicators work in the same way as before, but it is now possible to adjust how many bars back they will calculate. Since the dashboard needs only the last few bars, there is no need to calculate thousands of bars. This version of dashboard simply calls the indicators with MaxBars = 10.  
  

  
  
I hope this will help.

I started following this thread because of the simplicity - But now it seems to be getting more complicated - the original works for me - more indicators more complications. Just my opinion - not trying to trash anyone else.

yes I can respect that .. the scanner is just to tell traders where the semaphor is in relation to the time frames  
  
Hope it helps .. its 1 indicator

Hi Paulus, I'm still following this thread and testing LIVE this system with 1 microlots (each trade) and daily TF. I actually started last week and my balance is negative (i mean balance of the few trades I did). Probably it was the end of the month and maybe it's not the best time to use this strategy.  
Also, I'm one of the people who downloaded your indicator and I wish to thank you for sharing it. Even though I chose daily time frame so I just make one check/day to decide and trade (e.g. now, around midnight, here in Italy = GMT+1).  
  
I'm a little bit disappointed for my early negative performance. Even because I try to check main S/R levels. So I don't trade 'blindly', just because I see a number 3 on my charts. Anyway, I still 'feel' this may be a good system, and keeping on using it.  
Me too, would like to read other's opinions/results about.  
  
Greetings

I hope everybody is still making solid pips with this system. I have been pretty busy lately but I'm going to load the dashboard up tomorrow and see what happens.  
  
Paulus, would you mind sharing a step by step process on how you trade the 5 min charts. I actually like your idea of risking 5% per trade and having a 3:1 reward to risk ratio. If you have already stated your method of trading the 5 min chart please just refer me to the post and I will gladly go back and read it.

Hi Bob  
  
Loving this system in its original format. Its simple, there are no lagging indicators to follow, and the results so far, are very good. I will continue to test, but on a small live account.  
  
Thanks again Bob. 

What you do is a reflection of you....what I do is a reflection of me.

Ok I hope this makes sense it fairy simple Il throw in a few charts

  1. Use the dashboard to find any green on green red on red meaning 2 or 3 ball semaphore in the direction of the trend
  2. The trend is determined by nonelagdott ..you can use anything your happy with, moving averages adx etc etc
  3. Find the swap and load the chart on 5min
  4. The example shown is a short,so I now need price to come up above nonelagdot this is to filter out some false semaphore signals
  5. The 1st chart shows the 2 ball signal that would of given red red on my dashboard
  6. I then draw a fib line on the last swing down as shown in chart 2 this can be where its drawn or across poits A and B the blue zone inbetween 50% and 61.8% is my IDEAL window thats where price has to be when I get the semaphore signal but it can retrace further as long as nonelag dot stays red.
  7. Normal entry after that with limit order but nonelagdot has to stay red at time of entry as in chart 3
  8. Risk is 5% of account TP 3 x risk = 15% 3;1 risk return you can use what % you want 1% risk on SL = 3% risk on TP RR will be the same pips gained will be the same

very close to being a signal just flashed up by dashboard...just need price at least in the blue and below NLD  
  
Next version of dashbard will give box colour if price below blue NLD for longs trades or above red NLD for short trades

Howdy there,  
Have been checking on this thread to see and noticed your dashboard that you had made Paulus, good idea ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1).. In a post you said you were using length 144 for period m5 for the nonlagdot setting.. However it looks like in the dashboard code it is using the standard length setting of 20 for all the timesframes..Im not a coder at all but pretty sure it is using that original setting and not the 144 as you specified (check pic)..

Just noticed it and thought you might want to pass it on to the coder to fix for you ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Hi Josh thanks for the heads up  
  
But you can change each time NLD setting in the paremeters of the indicator I set mine to 144 and 233 for daily weekly  
  
Have attached version 5 which is just coded to use less PC resuorces  
  
cheers

Hi Howard are your swaps named the same   
  
IE in my MT package AUDCAD is named AUDCADpro so initially mine did not work either  
  
Did you download the latest dashboard ?

another dashboard pick but price now where near our 50 - 61.8 box although it is below NLD  
  
Future versions of dash board will let us know  
  
A - When the price is below NLD   
B- When price has reached 50% pullback

Quick look at the dash board gives us a feel for the market  
  
On 5 time frame across 20 odd swaps very few green green red red meaning alot of whipsaw with counter trend movement

Maybe you've mentioned it earlier somewhere on what to do, but I'm not seeing the big "2" and "3" balls.

Hi Martin this happened to me 1st time I loaded it contacted the coder and he said it was because in my platform all my swaps end in pro so he altered it for me so it would work on any version  
  
here is another version try this ..Im waiting for version 6 now which will show a certain condition I use for None lag dot for trades

Hi  
  
You have only loaded the Semaphor true none repaint version so this tells you where all the 2 and 3 balls were ..you need to load the repaint version this will always fix the ball in place   
  
I have attached it here

Thanks Paulus. All set now.  
  
Will a soon-to-come version have a (LOUD) alert when you get a (especially M5) red red or green green? Its the middle of the night here during "prime time", and one tends to nap easily!

Although NLD gave us blue dots on the last trade meaning up trend at the time of signal if you look at the actual chart in more detail and note the position of the 2 and 3 balls circles you will not see Higher highs...  
  
Not look at the chart below another signal ( blue rectangle) a few days ago NLD still showing blue dots at time of signal but price action entirely different  
  
Ive marked the 2 and 3 balls circles with bigger rectangles for a better 'feel'  
  
Here you will see higher highs the characteristics of an up trend not present in the last trade.Not sure if this would increase or decrease strike rate its only an observation but one that can easily be built into an EA if necessary

Not the way I enter no that is not a valid signal I need price above NLD for a signal...thats just to remove some of the false signals..  
  
The guys at the start of the thread and Bob himself did not enter with NLD or fib this is just my method of entry guided by the Semaphoe entry ..Bob did say on the outset trading the semaphor with the trend I believe .. nld just gives me a mechanical way of doing it

Guys, congrats on this very interesting thread!  
  
I like the idea. Also I like the way Paulus digs into the methods.  
  
Here is my two cents...  
  
I like the idea, but wouldn't do it myself because this method is a counter-trend trading -- like catching a falling knife bare hand.  
Mind you, you use a daily chart. This is not an intra-day swing trading. You are trying to get a retracement of a big wave that lasts weeks.  
It's not my cup of tea. (just personal preference...)  
  
So, I just twisted this;  
Try a 15m chart with an EMA48. If EMA48 goes down, you go only short at the BALL2 or BALL3. If the ball is on/near the EMA48, that's better. You go long in the opposite case.  
  
How about that![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f911.png?v=15.1)

The new version of the dashboard Im hoping will be slightly easier to read V6  
  
Slightly different text at head of coloumns  
  
Instead of 2 colour blocks per ball there will be 3

  1. 1st block tells us if ball on top or bottom if red block its on the top for a short if green block on bottom for long
  2. 2nd block is NLD colour if trending up then green block if trending down then red block
  3. 3rd for me but others may be guided by it.. if this block is green block then price under NLD if red block then price above NLD

So if you get 3 green blocks in a row we have ball on bottom NLD is uptrending and price has pulled back beyond NLD  
  
if you get 3 red blocks in a row we have ball on top NLD is downtrending and price has pulled back beyond NLD  
  
You have a pop up alert and sound mine is set to 5min only alerts with no sound so only 5min signals pop up for me

Its all trends within trends within trends  
  
If I trade 5min you need to look a couple time frames higher for trend thats why NLD is set to 144 its showing the higher trend sentiment  
  
If I traded daily I would lok at weekly weekly monthly etc  
  
The 48 ema looks good here it is set to the same colours as nonlagdot..I have attached it here  
  
The setups using Semaphor show great promise I think the secret to it I think is to filter the false signals semaphor trying to pick the bottom in a constantly falling down trend for example

Not in V6 but it will follow ..I find with custom inds its easier to do it in parcels so you can iron out bugs visuals etc etc rather than put an indicator together thats full of holes  
  
Just been told V6 on Monday sorry

Agree, and thanks for a nice indy.  
  
EMA48 is a psychological level, like big round numbers, major pairs (EU, GU, UJ) in particular. I believe in EMA48 more than round numbers b/c round numbers can be quite tricky (causing frictions).  
  
This Semaphor is very good to catch the bounce at EMA48. We could make a great system. If you have an idea, please post it on my journal thread. (I don't want to bother this thread too much).

This is the new dashboard I wont upload it here as a new one is being posted Monday with clearer text at the top

  1. 1st block tells us if ball on top or bottom if red block its on the top for a short if green block on bottom for long
  2. 2nd block is NLD colour if trending up then green block if trending down then red block
  3. 3rd for me but others may be guided by it.. if this block is green block then price under NLD if red block then price above NLD

So if you get 3 green blocks in a row we have ball on bottom NLD is uptrending and price has pulled back beyond NLD  
  
  
if you get 3 red blocks in a row we have ball on top NLD is downtrending and price has pulled back beyond NLD  
  
You have a pop up alert and sound mine is set to 5min only alerts with no sound so only 5min signals pop up for me

Is it possible to create a program that will show historically for a specific pair, non-dashboard, where signals would have occurred, with up and down arrows, to more easily be able to backcheck the accuracy of the signals? The non-lag dots will only show back a few days.   
  
Would you recommend a trailing stop of some type? I'm thinking once price reaches a round number or pivot, move to b/e.  
  
Thank you - it looks very good from the limited time I've been able to look back in time.

Is it possible to create a program that will show historically for a specific pair, non-dashboard, where signals would have occurred, with up and down arrows, to more easily be able to backcheck the accuracy of the signals?  I did have this option on another dashboard I had created by the same guy this would write to a text file that you could then download and look at,but I realised an EA was quicker and more accurate.Also the dashboard at the moment only gets you into the area of a signal not an actual trigger this is done withfibonacci that will be built into the dashboard.This is only my method of entry Bob and the original follows enter on Semaphor only  
  
The non-lag dots will only show back a few days In parameters you can set NLD to go back as many bars as you   
  
Would you recommend a trailing stop of some type? I perosnally do not I need to know Im risking 5% to gain 15% or 10% for example and the EA needs a none fixed SL to calculate the initial risk.Ive never looked to deeply at sliding stops I think you have to be very careful that you dont get your trade taken out prematurely.The only sliding stops Iv seen that works well is a Joe Ross invention of following the trade 3 days behind Trend magic which is a useful indicator.  
And using stochastic   
  
I'm thinking once price reaches a round number or pivot, move to b/e. Why not we all adapt to how we feel comfortable I personaly dont hold must stock in pivots there great for a trigger but Iv seen many a signal not taken under a pivot go on a make 15%

As far as im aware there is no sliding stop that could cater for the large pull back in the middle of the trade on this is axample posted Friday.Any movement of the initial SL would of busted you out before the TP was hit

Hey Paulus  
  
Here is food of thoughts about 5m. (don't take this one too seriously --- I cooked up this system in 3 minutes![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1))  
  
Set-up  
EMA200 with envelops +/- 5 pips. You try to get the bounce at EMA200 +/- 5 pips.  
Entry: When (1) the price crosses or touches the envelop, (2) you see a red dot or a Ball3, and (3) EMA200 slants toward the bouncing direction (yes, it must be trending).  
You enter at the bar close! (the bar with the dot/ball) -- meaning, you don't wait for the next bar close.  
SL=10 (not sure.... can be 20).  
TP=a red dot or a Ball3 higher up/lower down.  
  
Do you think you can make an EA??![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1) it can be pretty good if using it for trending markets. Oh, BTW, the pair must be with tight [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") \-- less than 1.5.

It looks good Ive wizzed back a couple weeks ..the envelopes like the 48ema that was posted earlier are all an attempt to pick a trading zone via a pull back and to eliminate allot of the false signals generated by the semaphor indy  
  
To exit on the next opposite dot may well restrict your profits though I think in low volatility periods they can appear very quickly in the opposite direction  
Perhaps you can do a manual back test of 1month apart 3 times TP ro risk and 2 times tp to risk  
  
System with 1;1 RR can work very well but even with a strike rate of 80% technically yu could have the 1st 20 signals all losers so you need to build MM around that figure risking 1% per trade would work even 5% would hold it you also need to look at viability it has to make money get 10 losers in a row to begin with and you then need 10 winners just to get back to break even if using 1;1 risk reward ...on daily charts that may well take a month or so   
  
With 2;1 the statistics are just so much better  
  
As for the EA.. I cant code I use a professional coder and it cost me money the dashboard has gone back and forth several times and an EA will follow  
  
Id suggest do a very accurate back test of 1month over several swaps using a set risk SL say and a set TP based on the risk...start with 2;1 if using on 5min Id also suggest using only UK market open to UK market close times volatilty will be greater  
  
If it proves viable I can put it to him

Thank you very much for your response! I agree with the above. 5m may be a bit to short to trade with this indy... 15m looks much better.  
  
Actually I'm really into 15m with EMA48, 200 and this indy right now. I see a great potential. 15m is easy to monitor and easy to avoid turbulences before and after news hours.  
  
As for EAs, it gets a little tricky because you need to identify trends accurately. Also, the volatility has a lot to do with this indy, so, manual trading might be better.

Paul  
  
Even when I input 100,000 for the number of bars on NLD, it only shows dots back to Feb. 5 - that input doesn't seem to affect what it will show historically for me.  
  
Thanks,

Here is the new dash board  
  
Make sure NLD set to 144

  1. 1st block tells us if ball on top or bottom if red block its on the top for a short if green block on bottom for long
  2. 2nd block is NLD colour if trending up then green block if trending down then red block

Hi Guys,  
just touching base with everyone. I've been moving house the last few weeks that's why I haven't been online.  
I'm back into trading again with my system, hope your all getting lots of pips, will catch up again later in the week.  
Cheers !  
Bob

Very good time frame however for me I do get a lot of repaints. Daily is good but h4 gives me a lot of pippage and better entries, on the other hand it doesn't repaint as much. Thinking of getting nld Indy. How's your progress with it?  
Edit: or semaphore Indy non lag. Can't remember ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Very well done Orid.  
  
I would be interested in the results of all those trading the original rules on Daily, or H4  
(like many here I suppose, I cannot look at charts during the best market hours).  
  
Just for my better understanding:  
  
* did you set a pending order long about 10 pips above the upper side of the yellow ball or opened manually when price was there ?  
* are your results based on exiting as per rules (when the opposite ball appears) ?  
  
  
Thank you.

Hi Paul  
  
Bugs being worked out in the dashboard signals? I'm a little confused, or maybe I'm not interpreting correctly?  
  
Some examples - see attachments USDJPY (signal not when expected) and AUDCAD (no signal given that I could see).   
  
Cheers

hi whenever,  
I'm actually trying to work out whether to pull out on appearance of new ball or trailing stop , or jumping stop ,  
still not decided , jumping stop hit on that us jpy I posted at +50 pips , sometimes the trade gos a long way for the good after a new ball appears.  
So at the mo if I am in green and new ball appears try to adjust stop accordingly at least 25 pips but prefer 50 pips. or grab what you can if it reverses.  
Entering I try to only enter in direction of a no 3 ball ,(misses a lot of good trades) I just try to follow that no 3 ball by around 50 pips or more depending how it looks ,until it reverses . I think from past trades the four hour is very good but im trying to have less screen time so daily for me.  
im not good at explaining hope this helps . I try to keep to original rules as much as poss  
best regards Orid peter

Orid, when you say "Entering I try to only enter in direction of a no 3 ball", do you mean, when the 3ball is going up , you enter buy? instead of sell? Kindly please clarify. Thanks!

Hi Pete, I'm in this one for a SELL too. Hopefully it will take off soon. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

For those who are trading the dailies, I noticed that most of the trades are successful. Patience and giving the trade room to breath is key. I am also on board the EURUSD train, and plan to let the trade take its natural course. So far, for me, some of these trades have taken weeks to come to fruition. I am interested to hear from other people trading the dailies here.  
  
Cheers

Bob had a great idea and shared his idea,some one picks a bit up and runs with it may fall may not some one else picks up another slice and runs with that.  
  
I was doing a course at _Liffe_ in the city when around that time the UK exchange went over to sets electronic trading.I may have my facts a bit twisted here but the guy doing the course said allot of the traders were pushed behind screens away from the open outcry system when the system changed .When on the floor traders would feed off of others traders emotionally ..being part of the group the collective was very important.  
  
Many traders couldnt make it sitting behind the screens it was unemotional cold without feeling..... and could never replicate the same profits.Many fell by the way side ...............I have no experience of this I wasnt a trader in the city ...this is just how this trader laid it out and explianed it for us.  
  
Forex factory gives you the feeling of being part of the group,a team from all over the world with the same one objective .....to beat the beast .....

I too trade the daily using Bobs original rules and this week I am short GBPUSD with sl moved to break even. Not too confident with this one as it has bounced off the weekly pivot but you never know....

I hear you Aussie, I am also short on GBPUSD, but dont forget it also bounced off MR2, and next week, WP could be placed on a different level.

Hi Ezzy  
I'm trading the dailies with the original rules, which I owe Bob a big THANK YOU for.  
  
I'm using a live account and trade without a stop loss, some of the trades can take over a week to get in profit, but as yet I haven't had a loosing trade. I'm only trading very small lots and as I gain confidence in the system will slowly increase these, but so far my account has grown by about 50% in just over a month.

Hi Bob,  
  
When do the 'dots' appear? If it calculating the high/Low, Wouldn't it need to have retraced quite a bit to determine that its a high? Which would mean a very lagging indicator and you wouldn't have entered/exited by the dots?  
  
Kinda like Parabolic SAR, looks really good if you entered the beginning of the candle where the dot changes, but in reality, it has to retrace and touch the other dot to create the new dot, hence, lagging and losing trades.

Hi Paulus,  
  
can I ask which build of MT4 are are your indies coded for? I've just finished reading this thread and I've implemented some of your systems before with successes and I intend loading up your dashboard over the weekend. At this time I'm still using build 509 for my trading but do also have the latest builds.  
  
Thanks

Here's the indy which fixed that - unlimited history of indicator (thanks to mrtools at forex-tsd). It shows a line instead of dots, but the line traces the same path as dots.  
  
You have to change DrawColorLines in inputs to True, and DrawColorBars to false or else it will make colored bars instead of drawing the line.

I think that one was made for 509 build,  
  
attached is one that is supposed to work for 600 from mladen (I haven't tried it - trying to stick with 509 as long as I can!)

I'm using a live account and trade without a stop loss, some of the trades can take over a week to get in profit, but as yet I haven't had a loosing trade. I'm only trading very small lots and as I gain confidence in the system will slowly increase these, but so far my account has grown by about 50% in just over a month. Martin

Hi Martin, awesome results, great work! It doesn't matter if they are small or large lots, you'll get more confidence in time. Be careful with the no SL, hope you know what you are doing with that. I have the same SL as per the rules, however my TP can at times be different than the original rules.  
  
Cheers

Hi Pete, I gave up on the weekly trading it's a bit too slow for me. I'm sure the system would do well, but I've returned to the Weekly & the 4 Hour Charts.

Hi Guys, my trades for this week are:  
I have a SELL trade on the USDCAD this is already in profit before the Friday trading ended.  
Also a SELL trade on the AUDCAD also in profit from late Friday or should I say early Saturday morning here in Australia.  
I have a BUY STOP on the USDCHF @ 0.88950  
  
I have a 100 pip trailing stop on all of the above.....  
Cheers !  
Bob

Greetings Bob. In your initial post you said to open a long trade 10 pips above the candle high, 10 below the low for a sell. Looking at your last charts it appears that you entered at the candle high, low respectively.

Hi Bob, the last chart is a BUY STOP on the USDCHF @ 0.88950 most of my trades are BUY & SELL Stop Orders. I like to wait for the market to meet my entries.

Yes, but is .8895 the high of that 3 candle or the high + 10 as per your original idea? To me it looks like the former.

Keep in mind guys I use this system with BUY & SELL Stop Orders mainly. I feel it's best to let the market come to you instead of chasing it.  
I'm also in a SELL trade with the EURUSD patiently waiting for it to drop...

Agree Martin.  
  
Also, with every system you will have losers, thats why money management ( having appropriate TP, SL rules) and psychology (being patient and sticking to your rules) is so important to trading. 

What you do is a reflection of you....what I do is a reflection of me.

Hi, Paulus  
  
Can you explain again about using the SemaphorTrue indicator ? Is it the semaphor without repaint. I was trying to put it in the chart but not quite sure how to read it  
  
Thank you

Hi porfirio  
Could you please give me some help. I downloaded your template and indicators, but my chart is not looking like your exactly. Please tell me what I need to do to make it just like yours. I have attached a pic of my chart. Thanks

Recently we have been discussing the importance of patience.  
  
This trade took over 11 days for it to move in the right direction for me. I must say, I was tempted to close the trade early, but decided to trust the system, and take a loss if it came to it.

Well done Ezzy  
  
I have been in the same position myself, but so far my patience has been rewarded every time, having said that I am still closing trader way to early but practice makes perfect and I think this is a great system

![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1) Great work Martin. The more you practice your patience with this system, the more confidence you will gain resulting in more patience, which it will result in more....etc etc etc. Keep it going and remember you will have some losers too.   
  
Cheers

There seems to be a few people who are concerned about repainting, this solution might help.  
Maybe if you wait for an engulfing candle in the direction you want to trade in, would be an option.  
Cheers !

Hi   
  
As requested   
  
Swaps no in Alphabetical order,recommendation by Sirwolf at a glance see what basket of swaps are trending etc etc   
  
If you try and change the none lag dot away from its 20 setting to the 144 and 233 setting the dashboard may not load I think this is because there is no data stream atm untill this evening.

Thanks for the excellent work on the dashboard and the system. Could you please let us know how the system has performed by the rules that you have in place. Would love to know how this system performs on pullbacks.

Hi Bob and crew,  
It's interesting that you mention this. I've been using engulfing price action on the Daily and 4H to great effect for the last few months, but I miss a number of large moves that don't result from those patterns. I think incorporating your method could prove very profitable. I'll post some charts of my entries and some ideas I have for how we might improve entries within your method. Thanks for all your effort in sharing this. I love simple trading, and this certainly fits the bill.

Difficult to tell with paper results I need an EA and test it on the various time frames.  
I wanted the dashboard so I could tell if its worth taking the next step and creating the EA I think it is..  
  
the main problem I have is that when we go short .. we are by definition in part play of a 123 reversal which can destroy the trade.  
  
How ever this pattern may be of an advantage to us which is what Im looking into now.  
AS ever money management is the key here ..take 100 signals 60% strike rate with a 3;1 RR  
  
_On 100 trades_  
  
we lose 40 taking each loss as 1 pip = 40 pips loss  
We win 60 at 3;1 taking each win as 1pip = 60 x 3 x1 = 180 pips wins  
Overall pips won on 100 trades 140  
  
But in the statistics of the 100 trades there is the scenario of the 1st 40 trades being losers and the last 60 trades being winners  
If you belive in the system and risk 1% of account of each trade thats fine but Im trying to find out the best time frame and the best swaps.  
Swaps can change but some methods work better on longer time frames ..it all takes time but the EA with back testing I think can help.I just need to make sure we build in all the paremeters we need to fully test it.  
  
The chart below shows the 123 reversal .. what would save us is go to break even at a cetain level in the trade if the reversal appears were safe..again this needs to be built into the EA for testing

Here are the entries for the engulfing system for the second half of January and February. I'll explain my entry rules in detail later if they aren't readily apparent to anyone.

I like the short setup on NZDUSD, but I think that opening gap will close before we head south.

I've been looking to get short on the GBPJPY, but waiting for that opening gap to close. We just covered the gap a few minutes ago.  
Edit: Entered short at 170.359 on a two bar engulfing pattern on the 5M.  
First target is 169.150

Hi Peter  
  
I see no SL on your chart do you still trade without one ?  
What is your pain threshold on this trade where would you close ?  
  
Thanks

Hi Paulus , I have stop loss on all these trades just above or below no last 3 disc, will exit on next no 3 disc ( really should pull out now I suppose almost @1000 pips)  
but I will stick to the , My plan of waiting till new no 3 disc appears then set a trailing , to see how I go  
  
The unbelievable thing is im not using any support or resistance . daily high or low, ignoring all news , (I don't even check news at all) infact completely plain chart exept what you see ive posted ,  
I have never had these sort of results not even close, can't seem to do wrong, it seems too good to be true , so maybe it is , but can't deny results !!

Well done Peter, great results as always.  
  
I'm only trading the daily, but the 4h looks like better results. are using a live account yet or are you still on the practice?

And so damn simple .Here are my dailys not so good but im going to try the same rules see how I go , still up 350 pips or so,  
Ive yet to have any account with this method sink into the red , even trying all the different entries and exits. Bob you are a genius  
notice I could have pulled out this trade at no 2 disc for more pips but ill wait for the no 3 disc

hi howa61,  
template is on p1 it is a plain chart with the semaphore, rules also same as on page 1 ; except at the mo I'm only trading the large no 3 discs , try to enter within 40- 100 pips of no 3 disc ( always with a stop order) So I follow the no 3 disc at around 40 pips if poss with a stop order , sometimes if Im late seeing the reversal I like to enter within 100 pips. hope this makes sense  
those indis are on posts 145 and150  
hope this helps.

Are you using a trailing stop or just wait till the next disc 3 for exit?

Hello Bob,  
  
I do not quite understand why so many pips below the red 3 disc ?  
  
I might have misunderstood some part of your entry rules, but I thought it was " 10 pips or so " below that.  
  
Is there any special reason why you instead set your limit order that far ?  
  
Thank you

Thanks Kaiser,  
  
I thought that too, but he wrote " Just placed ".... therefore my question.  
  
Moreover: if the sell stop order was placed based on a "previous" position of the Red Disc, then the SL should have been hit already.  
Now the SL is over the recent Disc.

I hann't checked but I think bob usually places stop order at close or bottom of candle, also if price didn't move down and hit the order the sl wouldn't be hit because no trade , (one of the good things with this )

Hi Guys,I placed the SL above the 3 dot and my entry under the candle just in case it reprinted which it did.Also the entry did kick in then went back up and hit my SL above.

I suspect without the 000_3_Level_ZZ_Semafor_TRO_MODIFIED_VERSION.mq4 file the indi doesn't show up on chart for MT4 build 600. Please correct me if I am wrong.

Sam are you saying that you have put the Semafor indi into your MT4 platform and it isn't showing on the chart? If so see e-traders reply above or try this.  
Open MT4 platform then Files - Open Data Folder - MQL4 and place the indi there. Close then reopen platform and you will be in business.

This is what I get on the file Paulus did on the 26th Feb which gives a lot of signals. I can't download the TRO version as I am on the latest new build which is MQL4 not EX4. My broker is sending conversion info so I will see if I can get that converted, anyone done this already?

Ok for some bizarre reason the TRO indicator is now in my indicators even though I restarted many times. The f symbol is greyed out but the indicator now works. I will post trades as and when I get a valid signal, with comments. given the news today and tomorrow it maybe next week........

hey all, also got a Question. If 3 Disc appears like in chart below would we place the sell order on the yellow line (but the candel did not close yet, still 1h18mins left) or would we put sell order on blue line ? THX in advance

I move the orders up if the disc repaints

Hmm my H4 chart on AUDCHF is looking like this , so at my chart the entry would be at yellow line . But somehow your bar allready closed under it , my bar did not..... Ah ok its the borker times .. im from EU . But you got to watch it cause the 0.8000 is a hard resistence but if it breaks it and wont go up again the price could fall...

Just my opinion but I would hold off on any new NZD trades for this week.....looks like its' "last run up" before selling off next week...........might be a great opportunity then!

Wait for the candle that has the yellow dot to close, then place a SELL STOP ORDER a few pips under it.

I don't really like the EURCAD at the moment but if I was to trade it I'de put a SELL STOP Order @ 1.51200  
The USDCHF same with that pair I'de wait for a bullish candle then place a BUY STOP Order maybe around 0.88840  
Same with the GBPUSD a SELL STOP ORDER BELOW 1.6640 I don't like this pair at the moment also.  
I don't have the GBPCAD on my chart,,,sorry.  
  
At the moment I in a trade with the CADJPY for a SELL and have a SELL ORDER wait for the NZDJPY to drop a little more, on the H4 time frame.

Hello bob you choose to sell CADJPY a little bit early because on D1 was already the DOT 2?

Orid,  
  
Has the S3 moved along with price? I wasn't watching this pair but here is my chart, different broker, I use New York close. My observations are.. candle hasn't broken and you would be heading into support directly below I like to see some space for price to go, before you take a trade draw in the next area of support or resistance if it looks fairly strong and is too close pass.

Hi Iamfx,  
  
This is just my take... Yesterdays bar is very strong and today we continue to push above resistance I would like to see some clear price action that would go hand in hand with the S3 on Monday, ideally a pin bar reversal closing below resistance, the only way that's going to happen is if we keep pushing up from here and we sell of hard later, possibly with NFP that could happen.

im just trying this on demo so i placed a lot of orders before i went to bed yesterday. But is not looking good:  
  
Went in on yellow line , the 3 disc was at that time at the candel marked with blue. Order was only 3 pips away of 3disc candel. Next time i set order atleast 5-10 pips under 3disc candel.

If i yould have placed the order 5-10 pips under the 3 disc candel it would not have triggerd the 2 order ... but still learning. But my orders where valid entries or ?  
  
And PAJ you are totaly right on AUDUSD there was a big resistence broken should have waited with that trade and with NZDUSD i think should waited to for bounce of the 0.8555 Resistence. But i thought just try this system only with the rules and dont care about news or sup/resis... i think bad idea.  
Oh and i mark my trades cause i make my orders with MT5 ...

Normaly right under the CLOSE OF CANDEL thats the rules. But you see in my last post #505, the 2 orders where losers. If i would have placed the order 10 pips under the close of 3 disc, the 2 orders would not been triggerd. .... I will next time set my orders 5-10 pips under close of candel... But thats only my try , the right rules are order at close of candel.

Hey guys  
  
i think USDJPY and EURUSD are really looking good to go down next week. But this is only a try with this System + SHI Channel indy.  
  
If you look daily chart USDJPY at the yellow circle it touches the SHI Channel in daily and when you look at the 4 Hour it also touches the SHI Channel.

Sry if i post some new indicator to this System but its only a try from my side . Cause i think we all want to make that System work better and better and make good pips.

Orid - Just a question-----also Bob could weigh in ---- Since the Yellow dot has moved several candles why not move the  
entry order just under that new candle?

> Hey guys i think USDJPY and EURUSD are really looking good to go down next week. But this is only a try with this System + SHI Channel indy. If you look daily chart USDJPY at the yellow circle it touches the SHI Channel in daily and when you look at the 4 Hour it also touches the SHI Channel.{image} {image} In here EURUSD in Daily it went over the SHI Channel and in H4 it ust touched the SHI Channel , but i think it went over the Daily SHI channel cause the H4 SHI wasnt touched (and News ofcouse) {image} {image} Sry if i post some new indicator...

KPack - I don't mean to disrespect what you have added in the way of indicators but Bob, who started this thread stated that the only indicators we need for HIS system is the Semafor indi. A lot of threads get screwed up because well meaning people try to add to what the thread is all about. You may have a great system and if so why not open a thread so people can decide for themselves BUT this is Bobs thread and we need to respect him and his way of trading while he generously shares with us. Thanks for understanding.

KPACK - Thanks for the reply -- i know you are only trying to learn and help others -- i certainly do not know what the answer is to the drawdowns. Maybe if when we get the yellow and place our order 10 or so pips above / below we should just put a small .01 order in the direction we want to go. If it retraces and yellow moves put another .01 order in until price comes up above the original order then go with a larger $$ order. Just trying to figure it out like you.

on both 4hr and daily, sorry im being a bit vague but I try to judge it by the way it looks at the time, sometimes nice to get in early but more risky  
please remember though I have a lot of faith in this method,because of my results.

Hi Peter..If I can just add my 2 pennies worth here esp as your going live Monday  
  
If you have taken this into account then ignore the post but trading across several swaps with various pips values can be potential account blowing  
  
Taking things to the xtreme for an eaxample  
  
4 swaps pip value   
  
1 $10 per pip  
2 $10 per pip  
3 $10 per pip  
4 $50 per pip  
  
TP and SL the same  
  
You make 4 trades close each for the same amount of pips ( 2pips for example) 1,2,3 as above all win = 3 wins 2pips each = 60 pips  
4th trade loses = $100  
  
Strike rate is a good 75% but you lose on the account  
  
The way to get around trading over several swaps all with different pip values is to take the SL size for each trade and convert to %  
  
So trade 1 100 pips SL take 2% of account and and use that to buy contracts to the value of $100  
  
Then trade 4 with higher pip value 100pip SL t ake 2% of account and use that to buy contracts to the value of $100  
  
The loss will be the same as you are trading the %  
  
An inexpensive EA can do all this for you instaly when your order is filled  
  
So you get a big down candle of 200 pips you get filled on the next bar and you dont get nervous because your trading a 200 pip SL because your only going to risk 2%  
  
Hope that helps  
  
p

to avoid repainting and dd worries....and enter the trade with pinpoint accuracy....just use fib and patience...nothing else....if you want ,for confluence, use TDI indicator , you can enter the trade with high probability success and less dd....fibs will give you many opportunities if you feel you missed the first opportunity.... please see attachment and you can figure it out yourself...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Thankyou Paulus, you are indeed a gentleman to offer such good advice, I really appreciate it.  
I will be trading the smallest amounts possible for awhile (mini lots) until I am more confident. I am still trying different entries and exits.  
Btw are you doing any good with your way of trading this method?

Hi Pete,   
I was going to mention something on the same lines.  
Each time I've gone belly up is because I've been greedy.  
Now I trade only a few trades at a time with smaller lot size.  
Cheers !

Bob, guys, I am assuming that the more signals combined the stronger the signal, for instance EURUSD has a S3 on 3 time frames, weekly daily and 4H, some examples below: -  
  
S3 trade signals valid for Monday  
  
EURUSD WEEK DAY 4H  
USDCHF WEEK DAY 4H  
AUDCAD WEEK DAY 4H  
AUDUSD DAY 4H  
NZDUSD DAY 4H  
EURJPY DAY 4H  
GBPUSD 4H  
USDJPY 4H  
  
If we trade the strongest either on the 4H or daily trigger then we could measure the success of those trades against the "weaker" signals. Personally I would like to see the signals combined with price action and I don't want to be heading into strong support or resistance, so I would be looking for price to break any levels with momentum and any retraces rejected. Good luck what ever you decide.

I'm waiting for another bearish candle to finish on the AUDJPY on my H4 which I think will happen Monday morning Pacific Time.

Frani60, I have attached the chart of AUDJPY, 93.00 area is my first concern, I don't trade this pair but it may be worth taking half off at the first problem area and seeing if momentum carries through on the remainder? it depends on your trading method. Last time it acted as support it bounced for days before it broke.

hey guys, i'm a 19 year old student and enthusiast and brand new to trading and these forums!  
  
i have traded on various demo accounts for a while using all sorts of systems, technical and fundamental analysis etc with okay results.  
  
but this system looks exceptionally good!  
  
Pete, a question for you, if you do start live trading, what size lots will you be looking to start trading with using this system?  
  
looking at ur results, would you step it a little higher than a normal starting lot size or be patient with it?

Its doing ok  
  
But many swaps and time frames its difficult to keep track and my record keeping is not good Im more a thinker creator and trader than a record keeper.  
  
I think Im going to plump for an indicator to be written not an EA at this stage..One of the big advantages of an indicator over an EA is that you can apply it to any swap and time frame and see instantly where the signals are.  
  
I will post here when done

Orid,  
  
You can use this indicator. Just input entry, SL and risk in % or in cash. It will give the lot size. Hope that helps.

you can trade with this system by folowing the trend 4hrs and daily TF's, the win record is high and good,just put for daily TF 800EMA,200EMA and 60EMA  
  
when price is above 800,200 and also 60EMA above all u will trade only long(my opinion and high recomended)and vers versia for short  
  
on 4hrs tf add also 1600EMA.

> hey guys, i'm a 19 year old student and enthusiast and brand new to trading and these forums! i have traded on various demo accounts for a while using all sorts of systems, technical and fundamental analysis etc with okay results. but this system looks exceptionally good! Pete, a question for you, if you do start live trading, what size lots will you be looking to start trading with using this system? looking at ur results, would you step it a little higher than a normal starting lot size or be patient with it?

Hi Aurafx, sorry for slow reply only just saw your post,  
In answer to your question (please remember I'm a novice)  
My aim is to start first week lowest lots possible 0.01, if in profit after weeks end , go 0.02 the next week and so on.  
this is on mini lots,  
But my problem may be that I will have too many trades on at same time,(not recommended ) but that is the way I have traded on demo with great success,  
I have tried trading other ways with all the usual indicators with terrible results.  
Actually read a story few months back , (can't for the life of me find it again) about a very very successful trader. he was some maths genius but couldn't for the life of him make any profit on forex,eventually made it big time , he was interviewed by a very close friend of his a few times asking him what the secret was , all he would ever say was "its very simple Buy when the price go's up sell when the price go's down"

Waited up for the open last night as we had a lot of signal - some with better price action and support and resistance than others - I am short AUDUSD at .90504 we had an S3 with a half decent shooting star/pin bar, it gapped down below Fridays bar which was sitting on resistance and the small retrace after open was rejected, AJ was good too. I want to reiterate that I believe it's best to combine the signal with price action especially if it's in a good area. having woken up this morning in profit I have taken a little of the table and moved my stop to todays high, lets see what happens at the next support areas.

Thoughts here please. Are you all trading with the trend only? I am up 70 some pips here but may close it as I am approaching small support and EMA's.

I understand, but if you're finding great success isn't going up in 0.01's too small an amount?  
  
That's (with my currency) £1 per 100 pips made, let's say you start slow, and you make 100 pips in your first week, you've just made £1 in a whole week of trading. next week, £2.  
  
I also understand risk and money money management, but if you're looking to trade part/full time and make a generous income out of it isn't that a bit too "risk free"  
  
I'm looking to expand my trading knowledge and experience before i start live, but i was thinking of starting with around £1000 (save up from work/uni loan) and start with lots of 0.10+ and if hopefully i'm finding success throughout the weeks and months, move onto 0.30 > 0.50 >1.00 etc  
  
IS THIS A VERY BAD IDEA?  
  
and yea, that's how most traders seem to have made it big ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

Trading a live acct on a new strat at .01 is a good idea, I am with you Orid.   
  
Adjust your trade size with the amount of pips you gain or lose, and you are set.   
  
Plenty of spreadsheets or indys for that.

Jhlewis10, looks like you are doing the right thing your stop loss is now in profit and you have a profit target just above resistance, I like to take some off the table on a strong push down to give me breathing space and see how price action develops from there, everyone is different, I think early on in the thread bob said he waits for a semaphore signal against him before he closes?

yes well I have made around 2500 pips profit in the two months trading this ,which I think is very good ,especially with no set rules, but really don't mean anything, I might lose the next three months , that's forex , so I start gentle to see if the winning run carries on , if it does for another couple months , might indicate a very sound trading method. But if I try to trade Larger lots and it goes bad it will be really bad especially with the multiple pairs, so I trade exact same as demo ,very small ,   
It can still lose because If I want to trade as I did on demo I cant use the 2% risk rule because of the large SL 's , I hate to think of going $ 1.00 a pip Quick way to losing a $10000 account if things go bad .  
Sorry for the long dribble,  
Regards Orid peter

Hi Orid,  
What are your current positions on your live acct? I am short the USDCAD and the NZDCAD currently on a 4h 3bar. The USDCAD is currently about 15 pips inot profit with the NZDUSD still at the spread.  
  
Also, why are your positions different on your demo than your live acct? did you have lingering trades open on the demo?

Looks like things are starting to move in the right direction. Believe me, when you go live it always seems like what worked on demo is awful in the beginning. Just stay with it, and you'll be fine.

My post got sent into "moderation" cause i'm a new member, twice, and they were both removed for some reason..  
  
I had a screenshot of my current positions using this system, i have 5 open positions, all seem to be going quite well for now, currently +1300 pips on GJ, been shorting it since the market opened on sunday, and i don't even think an exit is close. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
  
Sadly, i don't think i can post screenshots to show my positions until i'm no longer a "new member".

Its hard to go LIVE TRADING cause if your first couple of Trades go wrong. Your going bersserk..... Just keep on with your trading style and even if it takes a week or 2-3 to get in profit . Be patience and wait till you get in to the +pips then it will be easy..

Hi cavenlee  
Varies a little , but I (always) put a sell or buy stop order, such as this one and look at the last few candles ,and go behind lowest or highest ,I like to be at least 50 pips away from PA , this one is only about 30 pips away but looks ok to me .

Or this one was a large candle about 100 pips away but always a stop order at least then its heading in the right direction  
it would help if I knew what I was doing He He , or maybe not  
this is a live one btw notice it went bad for awhile but then came good .

will probably work , from what ive seen.  
I try not to take trades too many candles after the no 3 disc, But ive done that on live with us / chf was 12 candles away, and its the only one in the red (-300 pips)  
That one on us jpy is about 18 candles away  
its nice when the trade happens within a few candles.

only for long pos nor stay away from this pair for now cause on 4hrstf its kind of mixed up

I try not to take trades too many candles after the no 3 disc, But ive done that on live with us / chf was 12 candles away, and its the only one in the red (-300 pips) That one on us jpy is about 18 candles away its nice when the trade happens within a few candles.

Hi Orid  
  
I'm still lurking around![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
  
I'm still doing well , I have 2 open trades but both in the red at the minute, EUR/USD sell at about -50 pips and CAD/CHF buy at about - 20 pips, both the yellow dots have repainted, but I kept the trades open and things are looking a little better now.  
  
how's the live account doing are you up or down?

That's just the problem I have Peter, I see some profit and close way to early, you know what they say about "a bird in the hand".  
  
It really is a totally different game than using a demo account. I think you have to look at it as a business, imagine you were starting up any other business and you would have expenses and losses in the early days, as long as you're on a small account nothing too drastic can happen.

Martin trouble is its not theway I traded on demo (getting out early ) which will affect my trading dramatically !,  
Because I found if I stayed in 9 times out of ten it would make 1500 pips or more and makes up for the few losses.  
where as if you keep pulling out with less profit the losses will creep up on ya .  
Oh well all about pips at the mo ,keep on truckin.  
Good to see everyone seems to do ok , Where is Bob lately how are you doing bob?

Hi Peter,  
Sounds like you may be of the older generation like myself.!!!!!!!!!!  
Must say for some reason I have never been able to succeed with 4 hour charts...I blame .."Murphys Law"  
Your account looks good..Consistancy is the the goal in my opinion..Over the years I have had great wins but also great losses so I have adopted the "Tortaise approach"these days...20+ pips per day compounded .  
I only do forex to keep my old brain alive and to keep me off the streets and away from any Bad Women !!!! Smile.  
Enjoy your day,.  
Ron

> Hi Peter, Sounds like you may be of the older generation like myself.!!!!!!!!!! Must say for some reason I have never been able to succeed with 4 hour charts...I blame .."Murphys Law" Your account looks good..Consistancy is the the goal in my opinion..Over the years I have had great wins but also great losses so I have adopted the "Tortaise approach"these days...20+ pips per day compounded . I only do forex to keep my old brain alive and to keep me off the streets and away from any Bad Women !!!! Smile. Enjoy your day,. Ron

Hi Peter  
  
Im monitory both daily and 1 hr same swaps both look good atm  
  
Well done on the live account .. if you have set your SL and TP try to just let things happen   
  
Most important though dont hold onto a losing trade that will bust out your account it will take time mentaly to recouver  
  
try to use the % SL its takes away all the pressure and you can do it on any time frame swap and canle size

Anybody know of a good FUNDANENTAL ONLY weekly currency report? Something that gives a simple possible direction on the majors. I was thinking we could use it to add weight to our daily direction as indicated by the charts

Here is an actual example entry to SL is 85 pips but it could be 300 pips the risk will still be 5% or any nominated % you prefer  
  
This takes away the 'pressure' of running a big stop

Hi Pete,  
Just been reading some of the posts. That's great your doing well with the live account, I've been trying a few other methods but keep coming back to old faithful. I've found also using the Bollinger Bands with my method helps with confirmation of trades. And I try not to get too greedy by using smallish lots eg 0.10 for $100 0.20 for $200 ect ! ect !  
  
Haven't been doing too much for I'm busy moving into a new place and been living out of my caravan till the 20th of this month. It's a bit crammed for the puter in my van at the moment.  
Anyway !  
Have a great weekend and I hope you finish the week with a mega amount of pips...  
Cheers !  
Bob

I reckon even a weekly forecast would be OK as most of my daily trades take a long time to fire

something bothering me ,  
on my live account there was a spike overnight that should have ended a trade I had on at BE ,  
it spiked well past the SL but didn't end the trade , it worked in my favour as it ended going my way + 28 pips .  
this never happened to me before , usually spikes just enough to take my SL.  
Anyone have thoughts on this please?  
Regards orid peter

You need to phone or contact your broker and find out why your SL didnt trigger  
  
But be careful they may take your pips and reverse the descion to break even ........... spread betting brokers have a habit of doing such !

i observed on demo a/c but unfortunately this indicator is repaints it self. so be ready for booking loss till correct low or high being made.

These just cover sentiment which as far as I know can be traded with sentiment or in a contrarian fashion---ie. if 60% are long you can either go with the crowd or because the crowd are generally supposed to be wrong you go opposite.  
I'm more interested in a site that would deal in interest rates, world events and political/economic policies and give a weekly bias based on them.

I'm trading both daily and 4h, still undecided which I prefer, I think it's good to scan both and keep your options open and if there is a signal on both at the same time all the better

Would the indy give us the lot size based on SL? That would be helpful.

I've been trading this system successfully for a short while now and have to say it's going resonably well.  
  
H4 > Daily to be honest.  
  
I look at S&R lvls to confirm a trade, on a regular candlesticks chart.  
  
i've been trading ways that makes sense and "work for me" and it's been delightful (up 4000 pips on a demo acc with Dukascopy, up generous amounts in the thousands on demo accs with a couple of other brokers) looking to go live soon.  
  
Peter, how is your live account going? market is opening today/tomorrow - good luck for the week!

Hi Aura,  
  
How do you trade this system? Other than S&R levels, you just follow the rules stated in 1st post? Would you share your chart with us? Great to hear that you are making good.

Currently on my phone, so cannot post a chart. But looking at the charts using this system, you can generally tell which way the trend will go. #3 discs are the most important. I generally use the H4 time frame, and use the S&R lvls to confirm as i said. It is important to wait till the trend swings the other way before you enter, DO NOT countertrend trade, MM fake outs are hell for us amateurs. The H1 chart usually gives a #3 disc when the H4 chart gives a #2 disc, i take this into consideration looking at a few other factors, but generally i do not exit a trade until the H4 chart tells me to do so (also looking at S&R lvls).  
  
I've lately been more A LOT more confident in myself with how i've been trading, i'm starting to see more just by looking at a regular chart, so i haven't even been using SL's (demo). Good way to improve confidence, however i seriously do not recommend this if you decide to go live.

great to hear you are doing well Aura,  
bobs is a great method, I believe,  
My live is not doing that great I took Ct trades last week although its up 200 pips , with three trades on and three pendings ,  
still battling with the grey matter , pulled out of couple trades much to early last week, must learn to control this fault or all is lost.  
I will be stronger this week , (promise)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f47c.png?v=15.1) LOL

Peter  
  
Do you think you done anything differently or handled the lives trades that went bad differently ??  
  
If not then its just the natural sequence of winners and losers you havnt handled yet in your history of trading this method  
  
If need be go back to Demo for a week then do it and and rty and write down rules observations etc

Yep a few bad decisions , I really should have taken those 500 pips , but I wanted to wait for new no. 3 disc ( my theory ) before exit instead of no 2  
Will probably exit on no 2 next time ,live and learn , heh my two demos are still in profit but have gone backward also, so also a poor week all round, for my rules anyhow, we gotta have them though.  
Be interested how everyone else is doing??

apart from the 500 pips ..but as you said no opposite disc which were your rules then Id say its just draw down that will be seen in most methods  
  
Im looking at 1 hour but trying different ways of eliminating the many false signals you get,and Im still using the 3;1 RR and % staking on the trades.  
  
Il post some charts later  
  
Cheers

Hi Orid  
Don't loose confidence, i'm sure you'll be back on track pretty soon.  
  
I have a tendency to close trades too early so I would have probably banked those 500 pips as i've lost count on how many times a winning trade has reversed and turned into a looser.  
  
I've had one winner this week and two still open including the E/U sell from last week, I'm still hoping for a fall as it doesn't seem to want to move higher.  
  
Happy Pipping!!  
  
Martin

Hi. I've been using this technic with my own style. I use candlestick pattern as guide and confirmation to enter. I'll makesure the Yellow dot semaphore have this candlestick confirmation. And the swing is on ! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
  
For the SL. I'll move based on the dot. If sell :   
1st SL - Yellow dot  
2nd SL - 1st Red dot  
3rd SL - 2nd Red dot  
and so on until the Yellow dot have been seen.

Rookie mistake today, left a bunch of buy/sell stops open during FMOC, I was in a meeting.   
  
Had to work to salvage my gains today. Was up 45 pips and lost about 25 of them.   
  
Lesson learned.

Hi demolatonz  
  
All those trades look OK to me, i'm sure you will get some pips out of them, just need to be patient as they can sometimes take several days to have a decent move.

Well thank you Martin. Is there anything you wanted to share with me ? So I can improvise my technique.   
  
Now, I tend to add stoch 12,3,3 to see whether its already Overbought or Oversold. Most of my entry seems, follow the rule.   
Maybe next month I will try to use live account.   
  
Maybe I will deposit $10. The thing is. I am too greedy. As sometimes, I will see more than 5 entry. But I need to maintain my money management system

Sometimes, I do hesitate to enter. As, false Yellow dot might appear. Like this example :   
  
Long Upper Shadow / Bearish Pinbar already occur, but the price still moving UP.  
<http://charts.mql5.com/4/216/audcadc-d1-exness-ltd.png>  
  
This one also Pin Bar. But what happen ? The price moving UP also.

Well done orid just keep taking the signals....  
  
Im trying to find logical and rules based approach to these semaphors,which may sound easy but one has to illiminate the false signals of which there are many  
  
Its going ok any thing decent or any major progress I make I will post here

Hi Peter  
  
The 2 figures are so contrasting ,there has to be a logical reason I cannot believe its slippage on the live account  
  
The demo and live are you running these side by side ie if you take the demo signal you take the live signal if thats the case its the exit  
  
What do you put the 2 differences down to ?..its almost as if its 2 entirely separate systems

Here is something that may help to eliminate some of the dud trades. If you put the indi on any weekly chart you will see which currencies are strong and which are weak. On the chart I have posted (I hope it shows up) you will see that the AUD is strongly up while the CHF is quite weak. So theoretically it would be a bad idea to sell AUD/CHF at the moment.

I kid you not I do know the reason,  
the daily and 4 hr demo have been running a little longer than the live, and are about Be compared to the live account from same starting point..  
but the main reason for the live being behind the daily demo by - 1100 pips and the 4 hour - 800 pips.  
well the main reason is ... I only take the high probability trades on the live, so although im taking the same high prob trades on demo its mostly the other trades low prob , on the demo that are doing well and making the difference. So looks like at the moment I should take all trades that show no 3 disc regards less.  
hope this makes sense

Ah ok that makes sense we do have some difference in selection method  
  
I think the best way forward would be to draw a line under both accounts and start fresh with 2 new .. demo and live and take like for like trades  
  
I think for your own sanity it would do good, I suspect the existing set-up is frustrating to say the least its just reminding you every time you look at it your charts your failing...when in truth your not as the selection method is different.

Hi Pete,  
I've been working my system with the added help of Bollinger Bands and also the Stochastic, this may help with your trading.

For a BUY Trade do the opposite way around.  
I like to take profit when the bars reach the other side of the bands or you could wait till you get an opposite signal.  
You can trade this a few different ways...  
Cheers !  
Bob

You would need to trade 0.01 lot for $1000 account if you want to trade 10 pairs, or you can trade with 0.1 lot for $1000 account. That is not a final MM plan, you should change it according to your need. (Just a suggestion in the light of visual draw-down) I would like to inform you that the results are not impressive, especially in the market like 2006. Also be informed that these...

That decompiled version of PZ daytrading does not repaint. Arturo codes some good stuff. SL at the top or bottom of the box is too much often. I put mine at the halfway point. Also customize the size of each box for each pair to get the highest winning percentage on each.

Eitan - Your Project trade report for the past 17 days looks good!

I have had the ptzero indicator for several years now and can say it does not repaint.....but it works best on higher timeframes (4hour and above)....I have just never found a good "filter" for it so maybe this is viable now. One thought is to wait for signal on 4hour and enter on the 1hr or 15 min. It would mean probably less profit, but also less risk...  
  
On the EURUSD: it fell over 100 pips yesterday......and 18 ema has fallen further away from the 3 ema......so I wouldn't be taking any longs to be on the safe side!

eitan1010, good stuff...that candle that is a breakout out of box seems to carry allot of pips with it. I know the idea is to enter after the low of breakout candle , but have you looked at entering at the bottom of the box and not after the breakout candle?

Hello Esosa,  
  
I back-tested a lot of strategies, these are my special tricks to understand the movements, i have the history from 2005 till now, especially with M1 and daily charts. 2006 and 2007 EURUSD markets were less trending and more choppy. Opposite in 2013 and 2014 (continue till now), the market in EU is less choppy and more trending...  
  
Results can be different when we trade different pairs at the same time, but i don't think that the system has a long living time. System is good to make some quick money but for the long run, i would prefer not to trade with this if i am serious with my capital.  
  
Trading the My Market Order system can be very profitable if traded with discretion, its experience which makes money, not a system. Some naked traders are managing to make even 100% per month of their capital with consistency, you know what? It is their experience which makes money for them. About me, soooooo, i am very much happy with my system. Remember what i said, "Bob's system is profitable if traded with discretion", just like Orid did.  
  
Best Regards,  
PrinceWahaj

On Both 1HR or 4hr

What i notice is when signal is provided... And a 3 pops up on the same candle it usually is a bad trade... Since price seems to be exhausted.  
Trying to clear out the false signals... This method could be promising.

Forexswag, the original idea is to take the trade 10 pips below / above the bottom / above of the signal candle ( when a 3 pops up) which would give you an earlier signal.  
  
The PZ (which I have on my charts) provides a signal a little later, I am using PZ as confirmation of my entry. If after some bars of entering trade I don't get the PZ signal, than I consider closing earlier and only taking a small loss.  
  
Also, I am not sure that the PZ settings you are using on your chart are optimised for a 1hr chart, your entry signal seems very late, Eitan may wish to clarify or correct me on that one.  
  
I hope what I said makes sense, Forexswag, and good luck with your trading.  
  
Cheers  
Ezzy

I changed the settings back to default 5 since anything over range of 5 gives later signals...  
Before i was using settings from eitan from his 1hr post. His 1hr post gives good signals but there much later. Higher win rate.

I figured since the signals are producing way later i would use the trend= red.blue indi, and Min range of 5, plus the semafor number 3 before the signal.

ok guys if you realy want to trade more than 90% success trades you need to filter some false moves and to be in very confidental mode   
with your trades and system,if you want to trade the original setup of the PTZ indi its cool and also bring good resaults BUT! you must filter it  
cause there are lot of false moves on the original value setup..i try to trade it as stand alone indi in my past with the original setup and i failed with it!!!  
but if you have great other tools it can assist you to catch more sucsess trades and gain it with above the 87% win rate (i think its fine..)  
so i dont want to confuse you guys,if anyone want my help to build his system like mine please post here and i will do  
Regards   
Eitan.

Eitan: In some of your setups you are taking trades without the 3ball. How do you decide which ones are the best? Also do you risk 5-10% on your trades and close at 1:1? You are doing a great job on this. Thank you.

as my "small" experience on this market is this one:  
  
ok,on theory we should gain 1:1 RR or even more!,each trader have his own trading style and psychological level with emotyonal thoughts on mind!  
  
its very hard to tell what are our target on each trade and we can never know!(if somebody tell you he know so this is not true!)  
  
the real market stracture is 99.99999% BIG players game(bankers,fundantions,political) and they rulle it!all of the rest are the speculatores like me and you,ok  
  
lets get the point here.. becouse all the stuff i wrote above i can tell you that i dont like to be very explosure to market condition very long if i open trade  
  
and you can see it on my explorer,i mean there is no rulle for TP/SL..its all in our minds...in our heads,  
  
i am personaly know where to put my SL as first i do but TP sometimes and most of it i cut it before my target!and after that i see the price is bring  
  
(if i would stay on it..)even more + pips then i excepted..so there is no real answer to your Q you can always open higher TF chart and look for S/R area  
  
to consider it,i hope it help you,  
  
Regards

ok guys ,this is my personally version and update for BOB's system i put here an zip file with all ind's that needed for it  
also i put there two tpl files:,one hr tf and 4hrs tf (i usually trade the 4hrs )the rulles to enter to trade is very simple!the RR in theory is 1:1 and beyond!!but each trader  
can use it as his own trading style (i prefer catch QUICK pips and not to be explosure too much to market crazynes..)  
enjoy and trade wisely

Simple tips to reduce MT4 memory use  
Jan 18, 2011  
Most active traders usually have more than one MetaTrader 4 terminal open at the time for different reasons, either have multiple accounts, demo trading in several brokers, comparing strategies, etc.  
But the limiting factor to how many Metatraders you can run on a computer is based on the CPU speed and available memory. This can be a big problem when running MetaTrader on a VPS where you have to pay more if you need more resources like memory, speed or space.  
Here are a few simple configuration changes you can make to reduce MetaTrader’s memory footprint.

  1. The most important change is to open the option screen by pressing CTL + O, go to the Charts Tab and reduce the “Max bars in history” and “Max bars in chart” to 5000, this will limit how many bars are displayed on the chart and in the history making this installation unsuitable for back testing but it will use less memory on live or demo trading.
  2. Also disable every feature you do not use on the Email, Publisher and Events Tabs.
  3. Disable the News on the Server Tab.
  4. Close all charts that you are not using, each chart uses memory.
  5. Open Market Watch (CTL + M) > right click and Hide All, deleting all pairs that are not in use.
  6. Remove any Indicator you do not need.
  7. On expert Advisors if possible disable logging, the less you write to the Hard Drive, the faster your MetaTrader will run on a VPS.
  8. Restart your MetaTrader so the changes will take effect.
  9. Restart MetaTrader regularly to maintain memory usage low, MetaTrader keeps all the history data for the opened charts in RAM and only writes it to disk into the History folder when MetaTrader closes.
  10. You should also reboot you machine often and exit any programs that you are not using, on a VPS machine you could also disable many services that you do not need.

Creditors have better memories than debtors.

I am on my home computer optimized mt4. 8 core chip and 16 gb of ram so the bottleneck is mt4 and an indy. 10 pair up and it is almost unusable. Might try another terminal.

You need to copy your .ex4 file into the MT4's Data Folder. To do so:  
  
1\. Open your MT4 and click the File menu>Open Data Folder>MQL4>Indicators.  
2\. Copy your .ex4 and paste it into the above folder.  
3\. Restart MT4 and go to Custom Indicators in the Navigator window. You'll find your indi there.  
  
Hope this helps.

Closed A/J with a gain of 95 pips, was not moving s well as I hoped, so closed it before the week end and TP or SL.

Hey Eitan have you noticed that the false filter seems to sniff out ranging market...  
I've been testing some ways to implement it with 5M time frame.... For quick scalping... BETA Testing!!!!

First of all a big thanks to bobhowson for sharing his system and all the members on this thread for their hard work to help others.  
  
I have a few suggestions for addressing the repainting issue of the 3 level zz semafor indicator as follows:

  1. Trade only a level 3 signal and verify it on the next higher time frame. Take the trade only if at least a level 2 signal has appeared simultaneously on the higher time frame, otherwise disregard it.
  2. Use only a STOP order and avoid LIMIT order. This way, if the indicator repaints, the order will likely remain unfilled and can be deleted or adjusted accordingly. On the other hand, if the STOP order fills, it is more likely that it will do so in the direction of the trade and the indicator will not repaint.

Thanks again.

Ok now I get it.  
  
May I ask on what time frames did you try bobhowson's strategy? I'd appreciate that info because I'm trying it on H4 and D1 (the latter with a slight modification) and getting great results so far.

Hi Tai  
  
G/J looks like a good entry, I have taken that one.  
In my opinion G/U does not look like a high probability trade.  
I don't trade Silver.  
  
Happy trading.

Hi Taru  
  
As you know, the semaphore indicator repaints, there is no way around that. However, that does not mean that it can't help us in making decisions for our trading.  
  
Some things to consider when you get a 3ball semaphore signal are: Trend, supply demand areas, psych areas etc.  
  
Here are Bob's rule from his first post  
  
Happy trading  
Ezzy  
  

1) 3 Level ZZ Semafor Indicator... That's It !

**_THE RULES FOR UP TREND_**

1) Only Trade The Daily Charts

2) Ensure You Have A Nice Trend

3) _ALL TRADES ARE MARKET ORDERS_

4) Place Your STOP LOSS UNDER The **GREEN DOT** After It Closes

5) Place Your **BUY STOP ORDER** 10 Pips Or So Above The GREEN DOT

6) Keep Moving Your Stop UP Every 50 or So Pips

7) Close The Trade When A PINK or **RED DOT** Appears.

That's It !

  
  

What you do is a reflection of you....what I do is a reflection of me.

USD/JPY was closed early  
USD/CHF trade reached my target

GBP/JPY currently in minus, but patience is important with this type of trading.

I would advise staying away from 3ZZ repaints like MSpaint...  
Follow Eitan Trading method...

Yes Forexswag, indicators that repaint are not for everyone, I would not follow signals blindly from any indicator, repaint or not. Thats why the rules by Bob on the first post are important. Perhaps another system might suit you better. I believe that a system that works for one person may not suit all. For example, this system is giving me the best results since I have started trading, many years ago. As they say, horses for course.  
  
Happy trading

I agree. I have realized that repainting is actually beneficial as the indicator's logic reacts to changing price action. By doing so, it warns that the current trend is continuing and the reversal point is yet to come. This is crucial information.  
  
I've been thinking that maybe it'll be better to wait for the candle immediately following the one with the semafor to close and enter a trade only after seeing that the signal didn't repaint. Hopefully this will filter out false signals. 

The trader IS the holy grail.

Since yesterday, I have placed 12 trades after waiting for candles immediately following the ones with the semafor to close and not a single one has repainted. Currently I have 23 open trades on H4 with +933 pips of floating P/L. Lets see how it goes.

Many people have been asking me if I'm still using the original system.  
I must say I have opted to buy Cythis's Colour Ribbon System this week and combined it with the Semafor indicator  
For eg:  
1) In and uptrend trade from the BOTTOM of the Trend Channel  
2) If there is a LARGE DOT at the bottom which means a BUY Trade is about to happen WAIT for Cythis's System to give the BUY ALERT  
3) Then Enter into the trade.  
4) DO NOT TRADE if there is a WHITE CROSS wait for this to disappear.  
  

Inserted Video

  
  
This combined system has been giving great results so far....

Hi Bob  
  
I hope you don't mind me posting trades from your original rules. I think the original system has a lot of merit.  
  
GBP/JPY update - crossroads time, trend line now could be rejecting price. I will stick to my guns due to the resistance level at the 173.55 level, and play it out.

Hi Martin,  
Yeah it's great to be back I lost my mum a month ago and that slowed everything down along with the moving house and stuff.  
I have used the Stochastic indicator for confirmation in the past....  
Anyway have a great weekend...

Dear bobhowson,  
  
Please accept my condolences on the loss of your mother. May she rest in peace.  
  
Coming to the original system as posted by you, I found the zz semafor indicator very useful to pick reversals on the 4 hourly charts. During the first full week of trading with it (27 April - 3 May), I netted 392 pips risking 1% per trade and a 60 pips fixed stop loss.  
  
However, I was plagued by the repainting issue with many trades hitting S/L. I therefore decided to experiment with a few "filters". The first was to consider only a level 3 signal. Next was to validate it by looking for a minimum level 2 signal forming simultaneously on the next higher time frame (the daily in my case). Finally, I decided to place pending orders in the expected direction of the price action, in other words, STOP orders.   
  
With the above adjustments in place, my second week with the system (that just concluded last night) produced 1,134 pips with +1,747 pips of floating or unrealized P/L. Of course it is too soon to know if this ain't a fluke but I must say I just love the way this indicator works. As a matter of fact, the repaints have actually saved me from entering into bad trades or prematurely pulling the plug on profitable ones.  
  
Thanks again.  
  
Tariq

Hi I only bought the system last Thursday and still getting used to it. I only trade in the 4H & Daily time frames so I'm not sure how it would go. There are heaps of video's on Youtube explaining the system though... Cheers !

I forgot to mention that I now wait for the candle AFTER the one with semafor to close before deciding to place the trade. I place a STOP order only if after the follow-on candle has closed and the semafor has not repainted.  
  
I use the higher high or lower low (for BUY or SELL respectively) between the two candles to place the trade and risk 1% with a fixed 60 pips S/L. See the attached image. Hope it makes it clear.

Thanks ForexSwag.  
  
Below I am posting H4 and daily charts to illustrate a SELL trade on the GBPAUD that is currently 184 pips in profit. I've also explained why I haven't exited despite the appearance of a reverse level 3 signal on the H4. Hope this helps.

I'm holding a short on the Cable that has produced 121 pips. This is despite the fact that the GBPUSD has been in a sustained up trend.

Next I want to discuss the exit.  
  
I don't have a TP in mind and let the market decide. Therefore, if a trade survives long enough to be profitable, a time comes when a valid reversal appears. I simply place a new STOP order in the reverse direction and move the SL of the open trade to the same level. The following chart may help. Please note that you may not be able to see the SL of the SELL trade as it is "buried" under the pending BUY STOP order but its very much there.

I agree Peter and good to see you back.  
  
Nice work there taru.  
  
Looking at your last chart, you could have exited the trade after the initial drop where the no 2 signal is and re-entered again at the top.

Thanks Martin for the kind compliment.  
  
You are absolutely right about the additional two trading opportunities and there is no doubt both would have generated nice profits. But to be considered actionable, my entry rule called for a level 3 signal on the H4 and a simultaneous level 2 or level 3 signal on the daily. Since this was clearly not the case, I decided to remain with the original trade.

Yeah so far for the first week I made around 100 pips, but I did combine it with the Semafor system.

Here is another long position I'm currently holding on the AUDNZD that has produced 191 pips. When I placed the pending order, I was still using the high or low of the candle with the semafor. Also note that the semafor actually appeared two candles before the one where it actually is seen in the image. It repainted twice to reach it's final position. Accordingly, I moved the pending order twice and would have done it a third time had I not been late to review the charts. By the time I got to it, the order had triggered. I just decided to let it play out.

Hi taru,  
  
thank you so much for the charts that you posted. It was very clear and it really helped me in understanding how to maximize the potential of the semafor indicator though it repaints. One question though, I hope you dont mind, have you tried your strategy in a lower timeframe, let's say 15 mins.  
  
thanks and have a nice day![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Hey bob,  
  
nice result. I am planning to purchase the color coded system from cynthia but i want to have some feedback on how it perform in live trading. You know that systems are really good in screenshots especially if it is a marketing video or screenshot. Please do keep me posted if it is a worthy buy.  
  
thanks bob![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Thanks bodypip.  
  
Initially, I too thought the repainting to be a big pain. However, on closer scrutiny, I now believe it to be more a blessing than a curse. By repainting, it just reacts to changing price action and is actually beneficial because it keeps on refining the entry level. If used correctly, a semafor signal is very powerful and one doesn't need anything else to pick out great entries. Of course you'd still need rock solid discipline, money management, patience, a trader's mindset and realistic expectations but most of these you'd need with anything in life to succeed, let alone trading. 

The trader IS the holy grail.

One question though, I hope you dont mind, have you tried your strategy in a lower timeframe, let's say 15 mins. thanks and have a nice day![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Sorry to disappoint you but no I haven't tried it on 15 minutes TF. In fact I have used it only on 4 hourly (with validation on daily) and daily (with validation on weekly) charts.

Coming to the original system as posted by you, I found the zz semafor indicator very useful to pick reversals on the 4 hourly charts. During the first full week of trading with it (27 April - 3 May), I netted 392 pips risking 1% per trade and a 60 pips fixed stop loss. However, I was plagued by the repainting issue with many trades hitting S/L. I therefore decided to experiment with a few "filters". The first was to consider only a level 3 signal....

I your idea of using the 4H time frame and comparing it with the Daily I might give that a try with the system myself.

To all those who are afraid of the repainting zz semafor, let me suggest the following approach:

  1. Lets say you've just spotted a level 3 semafor on the current candle. Should you immediately trade it? NO. It just means that a significant reversal is around the corner but this by itself may or may not be it. We need more information to be sure.
  2. Now wait for the current candle to close and then wait again for the next one to close as well.
  3. Now look again at these two candles. Did the semafor jump (aka. repaint) from the first candle to the next one? If yes, just go back to step 1. If no, the chances are that the semafor has "set" and not likely to move again. The time has come to place your trade.

The trader IS the holy grail.

Another thing that I've observed is a higher probability reversal setup where a follow-on candle breaks the high or low of the preceding semafor candle. This means that a follow-on candle has a higher high than the semafor candle in a BUY setup, or a lower low than the semafor candle in a SELL setup. This may suit a trader with a conservative approach who'd like to trade only high probability setups. I've attached a chart to pinpoint three such setups. Hope this is helpful.

I was wondering with that cindy system, how do you enter a trade when a x always appears on the next candle do you wait for the candle to close complete then take the trade...  
  
Because the X keeps popping up... Because of the trend channel.

With the Cythia System you don't trade till you get a candle WITHOUT the white cross....  
I'm beginning to think my original system is still much better, because it gets you into the trade sooner especially when used with the 4H & Daily confirmation.  
I like that idea, because it's keeping it simple...

I don't know which TF you are trading but it looks good on H4 and validated by a level 3 signal on the daily. The rest is up to the market. It could go up into profit or it could go down and hit my SL. I'm OK with it either way. No use fretting over it or even watching it.

I don't have a TP and rely on a reverse semafor signal to appear. That could be anywhere. I'll just have to wait for it.

Hey acey2424. Hope the charts I've posted are helping. Let me know if there is anything else you need me to explain. Tariq[/quote]  
  
Great explanation Taru thanks.  
  
By checking to see if the semaphor is on the daily chart, aren't you in fact just trading the Daily TF ?  
Do you get the situation where semaphor appears on both 4hr and daily, so you place the trade and then the daily semaphor disappears at the start of the next candle ?  
Does this invalidate your trade ? An early exit perhaps ?  
  
cheers Stan

Great explanation Taru thanks. By checking to see if the semaphor is on the daily chart, aren't you in fact just trading the Daily TF ? Do you get the situation where semaphor appears on both 4hr and daily, so you place the trade and then the daily semaphor disappears at the start of the next candle ? Does this invalidate your trade ? An early exit perhaps ? cheers Stan[/quote]  
  
You are welcome Stan.  
  
Now about your questions.  
  
**By checking to see if the semaphor is on the daily chart, aren't you in fact just trading the Daily TF ?**  
Yes and no. Yes because a higher time frame contributes to the decision whether to trade or not. No because the actual entry is determined by the lower time frame and may be contained anywhere within the range of the higher time frame candle.   
  
**Do you get the situation where semaphor appears on both 4hr and daily, so you place the trade and then the daily semaphor disappears at the start of the next candle ?**  
By virtue of its logic, once it appears a zz semafor can repaint but never disappear.   
  
**Does this invalidate your trade ? An early exit perhaps ?**  
Nope. As I explained above, a semafor cannot disappear. 

The trader IS the holy grail.

A sell opportunity on the GBPCHF has appeared. I've placed a pending STOP order.

Waiting for the current candle to complete for a potential sell on the EURCHF. If the semafor stays put, I'll enter with a SELL STOP.

Hi Turu...great charts...read through this whole thread yesterday and loving this system. Are you still having good success with it?  
  
With regards to the eurchf. What time does your 4 hour candle close?  
  
Also I'm using the indicator from page 1. Is this what you are using. I notice in the top left of my chart (with just the template on), lots of info. which doesn't seem to relate to the current price etc. Any Ideas?  
  
Thanks

The candle has completed and the semafor hasn't budged. The daily TF also agrees. Everything looks OK. So here goes the SELL STOP order. The rest is now up to the market.

It's interesting to see that Cythia's Ribbon System has not triggered a BUY on the EURJPY as yet. I'm already in profit for 25+ pip already...

I can't control or even influence the market. Furthermore, I trade the H4 that means no trading decision is required till the current candle completes (usually many hours away). Running away temporarily is the only way to save myself the emotional and psychological roller coaster of the market. 

The trader IS the holy grail.

The SELL STOP order on the EURCHF that I placed last night has finally triggered. What'll it bring? A 1% loss if it hits the SL or some undetermined profit when a reverse semafor will signal the end of the run. We'll see.

Hi Acey  
  
I have been using this system for a few months now and I think 4 hrs is the shortest time frame you should use. The semafor indicator just repaints too much on anything less.  
  
If you are used to using shorter time frames is can be hard getting used to the 4 hour, but you will find it more profitable in the end.

Hi saytin....happy to know you are in profit. If you were asking me then I'll consider only a level 3 semafor backed by a level 2 or level 3 on the daily TF to move the SL. 

The trader IS the holy grail.

Thanks renyl. Great to know you are finding this thread useful. All thanks first to Bob and then others who are contributing.  
  
I hope you won't mind if I suggest something I have found to be equally important to having an effective edge. Just don't watch the market when you do not intend to do anything to the orders. Log in only when a candle completes, place new orders and adjust your existing trades according to your rules and get out. I'm sure this will bring you even more pips. Good luck!

The Euro is in a bit of a free fall due to the negative sentiment generated by the ZEW releases almost two hours ago.  
  
This is a fact of life for a forex trader and occurs quite often. What should one do now? I don't know about anyone else but I'm going to DO NOTHING. What if a few of my trades hit SL? Thats just 1% loss per trade. I know my edge works and I'll recover all of that later in just one good trade. Like a pilot needs to believe what his instruments are telling him while flying in bad weather at night, a trader needs to believe his system when the market turns against him/her.   
  
As for the EURJPY trade some of us made. I'm currently down 22 pips. From here, it'll either go down a further 38 pips and hit the SL or rebound, go into profit and give me the opportunity to exit in line with system rules. Either way, I am alright with it. If this trade doesn't end in profit, so what? There'll be others that would. 

The trader IS the holy grail.

> Hi Acey I have been using this system for a few months now and I think 4 hrs is the shortest time frame you should use. The semafor indicator just repaints too much on anything less. If you are used to using shorter time frames is can be hard getting used to the 4 hour, but you will find it more profitable in the end. Martin

thanks much. yup i tried trading the lower time frame in my live nano account and the semafor really repaints heavily and it really didn't gave me any profitable trade. I am trying now to trade at 4 hours timeframe in my live nano account to see how it goes. I think its better to trade live than demo, risking cents to have a real feel of what trading really is.

Hi Vigovski

Daily GBP/JPY update  
  
Trade opened 5/5/14, risky trade when you consider the trendlines, however strong resistance showing at the 173.55 level. Sticking to it, and price finally breaking through trendline. Hoping for a big drop. Time will tell.

Hey taru, are you still using fixed 60 pips SL for all pairs?  
  
what about TP?  
  
I think your method to trade this system is really easy to follow and understand....

My short on the GBPAUD is now 300 pips in profit and an exit signal has appeared. I have moved the SL and also placed a long at the same level.

Thanks lucariga.  
  
Your questions and my answers....  
  
**Are you still using fixed 60 pips SL for all pairs?**  
Yes. I use 60 pips for H4 and 100 pips for daily TF.  
  
**What about TP?**  
I do not use TP and wait for a reverse signal to exit. I have just done so on a short position I have on GBPAUD that I have mentioned in the above post. I am also attaching the same chart with explanation of my exit strategy. Hope it helps.

I do not use TP and wait for a reverse signal to exit. I have just done so on a short position I have on GBPAUD that I have mentioned in the above post. I am also attaching the same chart with explanation of my exit strategy. Hope it helps. {image}

great job indeed!,but be aware that sometimes even daily/4hrs entry that you use is made false moves..(even you wait and enter after it takes last L/H price)you  
  
must consider good filter to avoid it cause in "real life"..its very painfull to take the lost with the daily SL..  
  
anyway i wish you GL with your trades and suggese you to test it at least quarter year to take your concluusions on it,

Thanks Eitan.  
  
You are absolutely right about watching out for false moves and I will appreciate any suggestions to help avoid them.  
  
For the moment, I believe I need to take every signal that this system generates, limit the losses to 1% and let the profitable trades run as long as possible. I hope, by doing so, the profits will outstrip the losses and let the capital grow.

Here are a couple of MTF indicators to show the daily candle and daily semafor on a 4 hr chart, so you don't have to switch back and forth between timeframes. You need both semafor indi's in your indicator folder for the MTF one to work. Also, I have the mq4 files, but they won't work after compiling on Build 645. I had to compile them on an older mt4 version, then the ex4 files will work in Build 645. (the mtf semafor didn't work at all at first... several lines were commented out in error, which I fixed).  
  
Load up the mtf semafor first, then the regular one (so that the smaller semafors will be visible on top of the larger ones). If you want the mtf daily candles, load that up before the semafors.

Taru I have a question. On your GBAU chart didn't the semaphore give a yellow 3 signal on 2014.05.09 12:00 or there about? How did you avoid going long there?  
Again on the GU a 3 signal on 05.13 16:00 which would be about 5 candles back on your chart.

Hi tehO, forexswag is correct, I am talking about this system![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) For MRI, it is not included in the pairs that are tested. Better stick with the the known pairs for MRI as it has already been backtested. however for this system (market order), i think everyone here is testing the system so I was putting up a suggestion of trying this system in gold and silver pairs.

Hi Eitan,  
Looking forward to your tests....I do not hold high hopes as I have never been able to get the the Sem to work because of the REPAINTING but in saying this I continue to look for the "Holy Grail" like many other folks before me.....My excuse is that I am almost 75 years of age.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
I CONGRATULATE the folks who are trying to make this work and I must say after many long hours that their may be a glimmer of hope but if it was easy we all would be driving Bentleys .For there to winners there must be loosers...Time for a nice glass of Red Wine.

> Taru I have a question. On your GBAU chart didn't the semaphore give a yellow 3 signal on 2014.05.09 12:00 or there about? How did you avoid going long there? Again on the GU a 3 signal on 05.13 16:00 which would be about 5 candles back on your chart. Bob

Hi Bob.   
As I have explained before, I trade only those level 3 signals on the 4 hourly time frame that are backed by level 2 or better signals on the next higher TF, that is the daily. In both your instances, the level 3 semafor signals did appear on the H4 (as stated by you) but the respective daily charts remained silent. So I just ignored them. I have attached the H4 and daily charts of both the GBPAUD and the GBPUSD of the time you mentioned and they show the semafor signals as they appeared then. Please take a look. Hope this will clear it up.

Looks like a setup happening on EU/US on the 4Hr - its also showing confirmation on the daily.

Hi Taru,  
  
Great charts and some great trades there. Have you had any losers using the semafor system? If so could you see what went wrong? Wrong entry /exit or wrong signal etc. I think this would help us all learn how best to implement this system.

Absolutely right. I'm watching it too and waiting for the current candle to close in a couple of minutes.

OK the candle closed. Now I'll come in another 4 hours just after the new candle closes and see again. If the semafor hasn't moved anywhere, I'll be going long.

Just thought they might be of some use for people trying the 4 hr method with daily confirmation. I did not create the indicators, just got them to work with Build 645.

You took the words out of my mouth.  
  
Of course I have had winning trades and losing trades. Though the winners have been huge and losses small, the latter are not letting the account balance take off due to their sheer number.  
  
Clearly something is missing that'll improve the odds of increasing the win ratio and after reading a few posts by Eitan, Ezzy and ForexSwag not to mention Bob's first post, I'm now thinking of a modification to my rules that will take into account the two modes of the market (trending or ranging) and take trades either with the trend or from extremes of a range.  
  
I'll keep you posted when I find something interesting.

I've made my trade explorer completely public. This TE is associated with a GP demo that I am using to formulate a strategy on the 3 level zz semafor and will use it until it blows (thats what demos are for anyway) and I'll have to make a new one.  
  
Anyway feel free to have a look at the trades and stats.

Hi   
  
I once experimented with this indicator, but did not find success with it as it repaints.....when you go back it looks near perfect but that is because it works on zigzag system and new yellow dot appears on candle high or low.....  
  
I would suggest adding many more filters

Here's a better version of the semafor less stress on CPU usage....  
This also comes with a trend line.

Hi Feefee, What TF were you using this on? I think the longer time-frames work better.

Yes and the semafor has not moved. Everything looks good so I am about to place a BUY STOP at the high of the last completed candle at 1.37326.

Hey taru, if I don't make a mistake, yesterday your account was +16% and today is -48%.   
  
with my MM rules I risk just 2% of my account for every trade.   
  
what MM rules are you using to have a 60% drawdown in just 1 day?  
  
thanks in advance

I risk 1% on every trade. Just goes to show the many ways numbers can be presented. What you may be seeing is the equity that is negative as many profitable trades closed and many stop losses hit. Actually the account doesn't look that bad if you switch to balance.

I have carried out a preliminary audit of my trades and have drawn a very interesting conclusion. The 3 level zz semafor is a super indicator provided its used correctly. Of course that's true for everything but for this indicator to help a trader, one needs to understand that the semafors it paints look similar but carry different meanings depending on the context.  
  
Basically the best use of the 3 level zz semafor indicator is to **signal the end of a short term correction and resumption of the main trend**.  
  
In other words, the best use of a semafor signal is in the direction of the main trend, not against it.  
  
Based on the above, I'm adding a further filter to my way of validating a setup on the daily charts for the H4 trading method as follows:  
  
1\. LONG level 3 signal must be higher than the previous LONG level 3 signal OR SHORT level 3 signal must be lower than the previous SHORT level 3 signal.  
2\. LONG level 2 signal must be higher than the previous LONG level 2 or 3 signal OR SHORT level 2 signal must be lower than the previous SHORT level 2 or 3 signal.  
  
This means that the first opposite level 2 signal occurring after a level 3 signal will be discarded as it won't have anything to be compared with.  
Hope this helps all of us.

Taru, I am afraid your answer to my first questions has lead to this next one. What settings are you using on your Semaphore? If you look at my chart you will see that I have used Semaphore True which doesn't repaint. And where I have placed the arrows you will see yellow dots which represent 2 signals. Now quite clearly these did not appear on your chart.

I guess you'll have to accept different results between different indicators. Anyway I've attached a screen shot of my indicator settings dialog box. You may note that I've turned off the level 1 signal by setting its period to 0.

Hi Taru,  
  
First thing, thanks a lot for sharing your way of trading this system. I tried to follow you but had too many loosers and came to the same conclusion. We need something to filter so that we stay on the side of the long term trend. Since very recently, I'm myself using MACD plat on the daily TF. So far, 1 loss and several positive positions. Will report from time to time.

How do you all think about this way.  
Place Buy limit under GREEN 3 DOT and Buy stop above GREEN 3 DOT.  
Place Sell limit above RED 3 DOT and Sell stop under RED 3 DOT.  
To this way , we can prevent repaint issue.

hi tai9127, I agree with your idea of trying to control the repaint issue, but I would do it another way,   
  
Place BuyStop above the GREEN 3 DOT --- SellStop under the GREEN 3 DOT  
Place SellStop under RED 3 DOT BuyStop above the RED 3 Green Dot  
  
The idea is to stay with the current trend before trying to go against it. In my view placing a BuyLimit under the Green 3 Dot and vice versa for the RED 3 DOT is like catching a falling knife.

Thanks Bob~  
Is there any indi can draw the trendline from low high or high low?  
I think we can use it or fibonacci to figure out how it'll go.

GBP/JPY update.  
  
The power of dailies. Strong areas of support / resistance, trend line, psych areas and the semaphore.  
  
Already reached my monthly target with this trade alone. Looking for another 50-100 pips on this trade before closing.  
  
Happy pips everyone.

Here are my open positions, risking 1% per trade. 3 losses but good floating profit. I will exit as per Taru recommendation. So far, I just adjusted NZDJPY SL.

Yes Taru ! Still in ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
Will adjust SL on all trades save for AU and GA. No semaphor 2 or 3 has appeared on the daily for these 2, so I maintain initial SL.

Great! The AUDCAD has recently transitioned into a downtrend and shorts will likely face lower risk.

Hi can you please share your indicator on top left corner - the one that shows risk  
  
How are you calculating your risk  
  
Eg. Balance / ?

Finally, just adjusted SL on GN. On other trades, new semaphor appeared on current candle. Will see tomorrow morning as it is late here in Europe.

You can also use MQL4 scripts with built-in position sizing. I've attached the ones I use. These were posted by forexsaint at <http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=193727>.

Thank You for sharing that indicator , much appreciated ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
I am currently testing this indicator as it is not part of my usual strategy, however please tell me when you are using it on H4  
  
\- do you experience repainting?  
  
\- what is your strategy for entries and tp and sl?

You are welcome Feefee.  
  
I'm just testing this way of trading the semaphor for less than 2 weeks, so nothing is written in stone here. I've been playing with the semaphor since the start of this thread with no sucess due to repainting issue. Yes, this indi is repainting and a lot. So, if you trade it mechanically, no way you will make money.  
  
I then started following Taru' rules for entry and exit. Read his comments carrefully. They are very clear, well explained and I learnt a lot from them. I experienced too much losses though and decided to add a new filter to stay on the current trend of the daily time frame. I use Macd, but I guess you could use any other indi like stoch or MA. What I like in Taru's method is that it enables you to stay in the trend for long.  
  
I follow all pairs save for exotics, but MM is key here. Just 1% risk per trade.  
  
Hope it helps.  
  
By the way, closed AU for more tan 2 R:R. Had another loss on GJ, so 4 losses now, but floating profit still growing.... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f973.png?v=15.1)

1% of account balance. I use the position size calculator indi:  
  
Entry = 1 pip above the highest or lowest of the semaphor candle and the confirming candle (i.e. the candle after the semaphor candle).  
SL: just below or above the semaphor dot.

You could also filter the H4 using Bollinger Bands....use three of them   
  
Deviation 50 with a 2, 3, and 4...  
  
This really helps keep you on the right side

You can use any indi you prefer to keep you on the right side of the higher time frame.  
  
Yesterday night I opened a new long on CADJ and closed all remaining trades:  
  
AC: +2.2 RR  
AJ: +3.3 RR  
GA: +6 RR  
GN: +4.7 RR  
NJ: +2 RR  
  
So far so good.

For me, EU is still on a downtrend on the daily, so no trade. But, I acknowledge it may bounce up as it is close to the 200 MA. I prefer to be patient and have a confirmed up trend to look for longs. But that just me.

Are you actually using 200 EMA for trend confirmation?

No, I use MACD. But I like to have it on my charts. On the daily, it is a significant dynamic SR.

Hi Brad I was using Cythia's Ribbon System for confirmation of trades with the Semafor system I use but since changed to a Gann SSL indicator which seems to work much better.  
Cheers !

Greetings all to the start of a new week. Here is an idea I am currently trialling. I have change the setting on the Semafor to 13, 34, 71. Also I am using Synergy Candles and Extreme TMA Line. And the TMA repaints, I know that. When a Sell 3 occurs wait until the candles change from Red to Blue. Then put a Sell order in at 5 to 10 pips below the low of the 3 candle or that first Blue candle, which ever is lowest. You will see on the chart two past entry points and the order I will be placing on Monday morning. I have also included the state of play at the moment on my practise account.

G'day Fred. Yes, I am using the one Bob posted originally.  
And something I forgot to put in the previous post. It looks like another entry point is a 1 or 2 candle if part of the candle's body goes outside the TMA lines. This one is a bit hard to check up on the charts as the TMA lines repaint but if you try to visualise where the might have been at the time this could be a goer.

I think you're onto something good here, but could you please explain the rational behind changing the Semafor to: 13,34,71? At least explain a little what these numbers represent to you and what you expect from the result, or what you're trying to prevent. Thanks.

Bobha - Good one - I am trying the same type thing except no TMA - I use the ABP Synergy bars plus 3zzSemafor and the Traders Dynamic Index (TDI) as a visual confirmation. It appears to be working easily and well - actually am live doing it = will let you know in about a month how it is going. My rational is that even with the Semafor repainting it just says the trend is continuing =when it stops and the abp bars turn color it is a great signal especially when confirmed by the TDI.

Zxpips, the reason for the larger numbers is that this cuts down on the number of 3 signals that will appear. Why 13, 34 and 71? Actually I have no idea how I came up with them. It would probably more sensible to use 10, 26, 68 which are the original numbers times 2. I am also looking at going as high as 100 but it gets a bit more complicated at that level. If you use Semaphore True you can try the various combinations.

Hi guys,  
  
I just created a trade explorer linked to my 4H semaphore demo trading account. My goal is to be consistently profitable on a monthly basis until end of August. If I manage to do it, I'll go live with a small account in september. Mission for May is accomplished. Wish me good luck lol....!  
  
So far, the week has been quiet, small increase in my balance account. I have currently 2 shorts opened on CHFJPY and EURJPY doing well:

This is what you need: 1) 3 Level ZZ Semafor Indicator... That's It ! THE RULES FOR UP TREND 1) Only Trade The Daily Charts 2) Ensure You Have A Nice Trend 3) ALL TRADES ARE MARKET ORDERS 4) Place Your STOP LOSS UNDER The GREEN DOT After It Closes 5) Place Your BUY STOP ORDER10 Pips Or So Above The GREEN DOT 6) Keep Moving Your Stop UP Every 50 or So Pips...

Hi Tai,  
You've got it in a nut shell...  
If you have the Semafor at the bottom, which means there's a possible BUY trade set up make sure the Stochastic is also at the bottom ( Over Sold ).  
And if the Large dot is at the top which means a possible SELL trade make sur e the Stochastic is also at the top ( Over Bought )  
I will trade the pair untill I hit the next Semafor, trading the pull backs and the main trend even when there is minor semafor, but that's just my way at the moment. I have tried a few different trading methods but I always end up back with the Semafor system... I Love It !  
The system is still very basic and can be traded a few different ways as we have seen in the forum, but we still have that good ole Semafor as our indicator.  
Cheers !  
Bob

Hi cavenlee,  
  
I just use it as a filter on the daily TF. If it´s down, only short. If it's up only long. Entries and exits are on H4 as per Taru rules. Hope it helps.

Hi - I have been testing it on Daily and what I found is that when the 3 appears, you wait for the next days candle to appear, then create the market order 10 pips above/below that candel(the one after the semafor)  
  
I found this may get me in a bit late - but at least its a confirmed entry   
  
Hope that helps

As long as the Semafor candler has closed you can take your trade from that... Or if you like you could wait for confirmation with the next candle that's going with the current trend.  
I also trade the main tend and the pullbacks too... I try and squeeze as much as possible of of the trends..

Hi Bob  
  
Once again thank you for this wonderful forum and the good you are doing here,  
  
May I ask what pairs you trade with and what are your TP Levels and SL...for retracements (pink dot) and for yellow dot  
  
Also what risk % do you use, how long do you leave a trade open?

Before I make a trade I look through all the pairs and pick trades that have a closed #3 Semafor candle. I only trade around 4 pairs at a time, ensuring I don't over trade.  
My Stop goes above or below the 3# dot, I then take the trade, I used to use a Buy or Stop Order but not any more. I don't seem to have that much trouble with repainting. As soon as another semafor dot appears for the opposite direction I close my current trade and place a new one for the opposite trend. I tend to use 0.05 per $100 in my bank..  
eg: $100 balance I trade 0.05 when it reaches $200 use 0.10, $300 use 015 which is $1.50 per pip....ect ect  
Hope this all helps..  
Cheers !  
Bob

> {quote} Before I make a trade I look through all the pairs and pick trades that have a closed #3 Semafor candle. I only trade around 4 pairs at a time, ensuring I don't over trade. My Stop goes above or below the 3# dot, I then take the trade, I used to use a Buy or Stop Order but not any more. I don't seem to have that much trouble with repainting. As soon as another semafor dot appears for the opposite direction I close my current trade and place a new one for the opposite trend. I tend to use 0.05 per $100 in my bank.. eg: $100 balance I trade...

Thank you so much for the info, truly useful   
  
When you say the dot for the other direction, does this also apply for reversals? You close the trade and then take the reversal, immediately or after close?  
  
I must admit I didnt like it that much when I started using it, but once I moved it to daily and incorporated it with my current strategy it really helps being able to see the lows and highs plotted out so nicely

Yep !  
As soon as the other minor semafor happens on the candle I take it, but I do that on the 4H time frame.  
That's what I've been doing lately and I've been making the pips  
Cheers !

I'm quite happy with the system the way it is, I've compared it with others and it works for me.

I would take a SELL on this pair, there is a SELL signal on the H4 & D1.

hi bobhowson

or you do use other indicators for confirmation to enter the trades ?  
thanks

Hi Fred,  
Basically I still trade the same system only lately I don't do the STOP ORDER's like I used to other than that all the same.  
I just wait for the Semafor candle to finish then place my trade. These days I trade the pull backs to using the Semafor indicator.  
I try and limit my trade to 4 pair only...  
Cheers !  
Bob

Personally I won't be taking the trade though there is a possibility of TDI crossing in the overbought area, there is major support which is at 171.250 using the 200 SMA and the daily pivot line plus there is no No.3 in the daily chart.

hi bobhowson  
I see here you mentioned many times that you use 4H for this system, but in first post you insisted as a rule we have to use only daily TF.so please let us know which one is better for this system?  
thanks  
fred

There is a Semafor SELL signal on both the D1 & 4H on this pair I would take this... SL @ 171.995...

Hi Bob  
  
Are you taking trades 2 and 3 at the end of the candle like trade 1?  
  
Thanks  
Ezzy 

What you do is a reflection of you....what I do is a reflection of me.

That looks like great hindsight trading, but I would be very surprised if you really got those exact entries/ exits using just Semafor

Looks good, but I find issue with the reversal (semaphor 2) it repaints quite terribly  
  
If you trading the reversals are you in essence trading H4 timeframe?

He's using SemaphorTrue which shows the number of times the dots have been repainted and then finally hold at that position.

1\. I do not post charts or answer a lot of redundant questions. Mainly because because I am not good at expressing myself other than in an original post.  
2\. If you don't like how Bob uses the indicators then come up with your own. I use his method with a couple of tweaks.  
MY Tweaks with BOBS method:  
In my looking back at charts I put Heiken Ashi bars on the chart and found that if you wait for the change of color after the Semafor signal you will be pretty solid in your entries. I also added the only other indicator I use which is the TDI (Traders Dynamic Index) to confirm the Semafor signal. It MUST have a cross and the Heiken ashi bars must change color before I take the trade. I trade only H4 and Daily  
  
If you have questions then try it out for a week or so and then ask. Or use Semafor confirmed with the Stoch Oscillator as Bob does. Either will work. Patience is key. Closed candles are key. Money management is key.  
  
The method is Bobs - It is a good method where he trades and with the broker he uses. We must use his ideas and come up with what works for us in our situation.  
  
Good trading guys and thanks many times over for sharing your method Bob.  
edit: I notice Bobha and Shinewel both use the APB or Heiken ashi bars. Also I use the 5 ema with a 3 shift which is further confirmation. Basically I use the Trading Made Simple started by eelfranz and combine it with Bobs method.

It's a different indicator I have attached, use it together with the regular ZZ semafor indicator and you will see that it paints a dot whenever a Semaphor appears and stays there.   
  
As you know the regular ZZ semafor indicator will re-paint whenever there is a new high/ low, so watch both indicators together on a 1 min chart just to see how it works, (change setting edblOffsetPoints lower for better visual display)

Excellent answer....I agree, there is no one fit model for everyone....you need to try and see what works for you as an individual  
I have been a day trader for years and thanks to Bobs ideas and the semaphor using it on Dailys along with Bollinger bands to do position trading  
  
Thank you Bob for sharing, keep up the good work

Yeah everybody trades in their own way, use what ever works for you, guys.  
There are many ways you can use the semafor as you can see with many suggestions in this forum.  
Anyway it's all very interesting...  
Thanks Tom ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

I got the idea of trading with the semafor after coming across the Zig Zag indicator when I first started trading around a year ago.  
The Semafor I found in another System which I came across while trying different idea's.  
Anyway lots of luck guys.

Hi Bob  
  
I also had the Semafor, and didnt like it so left it aside, then I saw your thread and decided to give it a go for longer term trading  
  
Do you know how the reversal semafor works, what it is based on....Im just trying to understand the reversal indicator a bit more.  
  
Thank You

Good Mornin' Fee,  
I'm really still a beginner only been trading for around 18 months, so when it comes to the technical s _de of trading I'm buggered. I do know that the smaller the semafor number on the dot the less reliable it is. I only trade these on the 4H if it is a #2 or 3. One of our members I made a noter of confirms the signal between the 4H & Daily, which I thought was a great idea and seems to work very well._  
_eg: If there is a #3 dot on the H4 and a #2 on the D1 that would be a trade._  
_Hope this is helpful.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)_

Hi, Bob,  
  
I noticed many of your trades are a very short duration, like a few hours or less (some only a few minutes). If you are trading on the 4hr and daily charts, how are you determining your exits? If we wait for the next semafor to appear on 4hr or daily charts, wouldn't these trades normally go on for days? thanks ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Yesterday I was in a panic when the market started going up & down and didn't know which way to go. Other than that, when I trade the minor semafor sometime it will only last a day or two on the 4H timeframe. I usually check my trades at 7am, 11am, 3pm, 7pm and 11pm if there is a new semafor I will close and trade and start another if it fits all the rules. I suppose you could say I surf the candles up and down, since doing this I've made a lots more pips.  
  
I once stayed with the Daily from start to finish riding the tend till the main Semafor appears then closed in profit.  
I suppose everyone has different styles..  
Cheers !

Shinewel,I think it's more useful to confirm the enter point by these,I also watch for useful to combine with Bob's system.Cheer up!

I would take this SELL trade even though it has a minor Semafor, place your SL at the top of the #3 dot the risk is only 20 or so pips.

Hi Bob,  
Yesterday was a chaotic late in the day due to all the Red Flag news...Fortunately I achieved my daily target in the Asian sessian..  
Many folks take to-day off because the markets are slow due to the major red US flag at 10.30 p.m our time.  
I congratulate you on your endevour to share your experiences in this most volotile arena...History shows that trends have changed and will continue to do so as nothing stays the same in life, but that is only my humble opinion which may be worthless.

Also the reason for the shorter trades of late I took a leaf out of someone system were he only targets 40 pips for the TP also the SL is 40 pips. This is what I've been doing over the last couple of days on the Daily time frame. It would be lovely to get 10 trades with 40 pip profit each week.  
Have a great weekend.

I placed a SELL trade on the EURUSD and now I'm half way to my profit level of 40 pips.

> {quote} Good Mornin' Fee, I'm really still a beginner only been trading for around 18 months, so when it comes to the technical sde of trading I'm buggered. I do know that the smaller the semafor number on the dot the less reliable it is. I only trade these on the 4H if it is a #2 or 3. One of our members I made a noter of confirms the signal between the 4H & Daily, which I thought was a great idea and seems to work very well. eg: If there is a #3 dot on the H4 and a #2 on the D1 that would be a trade. Hope this is helpful.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Hi, well for someone who claims to be a beginner, I would say you have a great knowledge and have a good tolerance for this trading style, a good fit. I have used entires based on daily lows or highs for a long time for swing trading. In essence you are trading the H4 charts between the bollingers, even if you are not aware of it...good job...

This is what I've been doing over the last couple of days on the Daily time frame. It would be lovely to get 10 trades with 40 pip profit each week. Have a great weekend.

Simple system yet effective as long as MM is controlled. Best of all if trading on H4 and checking confirmation on daily is stress free. More time for love one.   
Will be trying it out according to the orignal simple rules.  
  
Thanks for sharing.

hi friend  
must be that my English is very bad because you have not heard anything  
  
where are EMA-sma200? there should bounce price in the lower tf  
  
also...I use w1-d1 or d1-h4  
you've left me amazed with your questions ... maybe not for me because they have nothing to do with the strategy to explain

Hi Porfirio,  
  
Thank you for the examples of how you trade. I think I understand. Please could you tell me which settings you use for the simple and exponential moving averages.  
  
Thank you again.

Hello everyone and Porfirio,  
Porfirio i guess u are using MTF analysis in your trade but i really do not understand it wholly.You say ball 1 or 2 on HTF and ball 3 on LTF.Do u mean ball 1 and 2 are the signal on HTF and ball 3 the signal on LTF.Pls put me in the know by explaning it in a layman manner.Thank you in advance.

ADESHINA.

The ball is moved is because there are new low before a high is made.  
As long as there are new low before a high occur or new high before the low occur, the ball will shift.

Hi again Porfirio,  
  
Thank you for the reply but unfortunately you did not understand what I meant. I know and understand that you are using 200 ema/sma however... what I wanted to know was the ma settings for SHIFT and whether the ma is set to OPEN or CLOSE or something else.  
  
Thanks.

High again Porfirio!  
  
Thank you for confirming the ma settings, all clear now ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1) With regards to the semaphore, are they standard settings? and are these settings the same for both LOWER and HIGHER timeframes or are they different?  
  
Sorry for all the questions, just want to make sure we are both on the same page ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
  
Final 3 questions! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61e.png?v=15.1)  
  
1\. Having identified a 1,2 or 3 ball bouncing off of the ma's on the HIGHER timeframe DOES IT MATTER which number shows on the LOWER timeframe? or is it important to wait for a 3 BALL?  
  
2\. Looking at your chart examples it appears that you always use a 1:1 risk reward, with a 10pip TP & SL is this correct?and if so any particular reason?  
  
3\. May I ask how long you have been trading this and is it consistently profitable for you?  
  
Thank you,  
Kevin.

\- yes, 1:1 ... sl ball 3

Hi everyone, read most of this thread andamvery keen to have a go with Bob's indicator however i'm having trouble loading it onto my metatrader platform.  
I've tried both IBFX & Global Prime platforms with no success. I've tried to drop the indicator in via the 'Properties/OpenFile Location/MQL4/Indicators' & 'Properties/Open File Location/Experts/Indicators' filepaths, is there another way i should be trying or maybe another step other than downloading from page 1 in this thread & copying into above mentioned filepaths??  
  
TIA guys ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Hi Guys I have change the approach of this system slightly which you may like to try.  
The image attached has all the rules except that instead of taking profit 50 pips I now have a TRAILING STOP of 50 pips and just let the trade run.  
Also I enter the trade at the CLOSE of the Semafor candle with a BUY or SELL stop trade...  
Have a great trading week...

Hi Feefee,  
No still using the Semafor but on the DAILY Time Frame but I have added a Trend Channel indicator which shows the trend. I enter the trade at the Close of the Semafor Candle with a BUY or SELL Stop Trade.  
Cheers !  
Bob

The NB-channel indicator is simply a renamed SHI-channel indicator. Google SHI channel to get additional info to better implement its use.

I love the Semafor indicator, But Guys one of the Reasons for repainting is News, u should be grounded on the fundamental aspect. One other thing, Don't enter a New Trend when that particular currency is not on it season, when it is not on the market season, it tends to repaint, when the season starts, d market trend is established and the best timeframe is the 4H and Daily chart. Always keep ur eyes on the Daily chart

If I were you Guys I will try and stay away from the CHF Pairs, it leads to high Drawdown and it will strain ur patience even though it will still make some profit with this system

Sorry for the belated response. Yes I have moved on to explore other approaches of trading forex and I'm afraid 3 level zz semafor isn't one of them. Anyway good luck with your trading. 

The trader IS the holy grail.

Hi Paulus,  
  
I downloaded the most recent Ball Dashboard that you posted and I do find it quite useful for helping me quickly scan for pairs to trade. My only problem is that it keeps giving me alerts for the 5M balls and I won't to turn them off.  
  
Is there a way that you can have your programmer make a version where I can set alerts only to be shown for the 4H, Daily and Weekly Balls?  
  
I would also like the ability to only show the 4H, Daily and Weekly Timeframes displayed on the dashboard to save screen space.  
  
That would be awesome if you can add those features and maybe e-mail alerts too!  
  
Big thanks to Bob, Taru, Perfirio, Paulus and everyone else who contributed good ideas to this thread! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)

Porfirio,   
  
Interesting system, how do you use this system, do you use H1 TF with reference to some other TF?  
  
Thanks.

hi porfirio, you as an experienced trader would like to ask you this.........after how many candles {the balls 1/2/3 stop repainting (jumping)}......so there is a confirmation of _high probability_ of reversal trend starting....

I do not use the semaphore  
  
just zig-zag, stochastic and fractal (no repaint normally) .... I use two tf .... w1-d1 or d1-h4  
  
  
look gbp-chf and eur-gbp

Hi porfirio,  
  
Is there any specific rule to exit the trade or just to exit on next fractal of lower tf.

On D1 fractal appears and on H4 again there is fractal at upper end and stock is overbought, price is coming down.  
  
This trade is taken as per the rules I can understand after viewing your previous posts, I will be glad if you can explain the exact rules, I know it is some what difficult for you to translate it in eng but I pls try and if you can better explain into you language just do it I will take help of online translator.

hi putin  
  
  
if you want you can go against the trend of higher tf, in this case d1.

thanks the porfirio for the system and explaination also ,based from my understanding which is from the daily chart we identified the trend from fractal ,and once the trend was identified and change to TF 4hr look at the stoch whether is overbought or oversell and then just decide whether can place the order , entry strategy is like this ?  
and from this chart i have no idea what is the trend , do you know how to trade when the chart like this ?

at the moment it is ranging...near a strong resistance zone  
no trades  
wait to see a fractal on top/daily chart  
when it happens move to 4hr chart and make short trade entry when the 4hr candle closes creating a fractal  
though there is room to go up, taking a long trade is risky at this level, unless you have similar set ups in 5 or 15 m t/f for a quick small scalp  
but that is not the strategy we are working on...  
i would rather wait to take a short trade... unless i am already riding on the long trade ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

my thought is since we need to identifiy the trend mean that we should follow the trend in daily chart right ? then if we take the short seems is against the trend ?

first of all, you must understand, the whole thread is all about spotting the beginning of a trend reversal or a big pull back which is also in other words swing trade opportunities....  
so we are looking for change in the swing and to enter early to ride with the swing  
audjpy is in the uptrend....now rather possibly near the end of an uptrend  
if the set up says end of the present long trend you look for opportunities to short  
if the set up says continuation of the present long trend, you trade long (for which you should see a fractal at the bottom in 4 hr chart)  
in the present scenario you see neither of them  
so we need to wait to see the fractal, to take any position and to make profits  
now we are in between a long swing....we are looking for beginning/end of any swings  
however you can enter long trades using smaller time frames............

in gbp-chf I put a pending order to cover the gap ....

eur-gbp...also happened the same  
  
with regard usd-cad  
I risked a bit because the trend is up  
but I saw a strong resistance, so enter sell

I will try to explain a possible buy entry  
  
I suggest you keep it simple ... just use logic and trendlines  
  
  
  
also observed the movement of bb  
  
  
but...  
  
  
the most important thing is that you see the fractal in w1 ... if the fractal is not listed you can not enter

hi ezzy  
  
that was a good entry  
  
semaphore replaced by fractal and your coming would have been much safer  
  
I commented you from experience  
  
  
semaphore is much repaints ... I used it before

Hi Porfirio  
  
Thats true, it repaints, so dont take every entry, be selective. It almost seems that the lower the time frame the more it repaints. However, I prefer to use semaphore, along with support resistance and trend. Its been very good for me so far.  
  
All the best porfirio

i am a bit confused about the entry with recent discussion.....possible to explain step by step way to spot the trade and enter......how you decide trend and then what you look for in big and smaller time frames etc......do we have to be glued to the pc to enter at the right time in the smaller ti/f or stop/limit orders are placed........appreciate your time to explain  
cheers

Hi porfirio  
  
17th August was the day when a weekly fractal low was formed, now as you say we should move to daily to find a fractal low for buy entry and that was 22nd August; is this right?

Hi shinewel, my entry in the EURGBP was more aggressive than what I would like. Generally I put a pending order below the signal bar and and if price reaches it, it triggers the trade, if price most up and semaphore repaints, I delete the order ad re-asssess.  
  
Ps - Check the first post by the thread owner, he explains how he trades this system. I am trading it very similarly to him  
  
Cheers  
Ezzy

shinewel, forget the semaphore is simply a zigzag ...do not waste your time  
  
Imagine that one day you want to invest in shares of the stock Exchange...through your bank  
  
all platforms, from the simplest to the most sophisticated have fractals, stoch,zz ... you will know to use all plataforms

I suggest moving the SL to entry point...

HI SHINEWELL  
  
the main function of zz is in the upper tf ... gives us the area tp  
also is a visual aid and to draw trendlines  
  
example... N-U....d1-h4.... 1 sep 14

Hi Howard  
It is amazing but this is the first strategy that I believe (2008)... was profitable  
  
but...  
discovered after many forums with many strategies and indicators, and leave this strategy abandoned in a drawer  
a few months ago looking for the contract of the policy of my car, I saw a paper on which it described this strategy in a few lines ... and recover  
I did not even remember that I had written  
  
I have not tested but is profitable ... just follow the trend through fractals and trendlines  
  
hi cavenlee... no special criteria .... I observe, drawing trendlines ...  
  
shinewel ....example .... buy-sl-tp

for eurchf, so this is the valid sell for this situation right ?  
by the way my eurchf H4 chart bar a bit different with your H4 chart because our platform is different ?

NO, cavenlee.....you have not understood  
  
  
  
  
  
should be the language ... I do not express  
  
TF upper gives trend with fractals............. fractals only tf upper  
TF lower gives entrance (stoch)  
  
you read the post 1224-1225

no, cavenlee  
  
not by stoch... stoch in d1 I don´t care  
  
It is the figure, fractals (in d1 down fractal), trendlines, bb (h4)  
  
I prefer clear configurations  
  
if I doubt ... I don´t go  
  
It is a matter of practice

Hi Mr, P  
I discovered that candle data/setup differ for must brokers. I could not find the basis for your analysis on usdcad until i downloaded the deltastock platform. what is your take on this. Again your chart is identical to that of Cvenlee, is there a post where u posted a template 4 this system. I Have searched but could not find it.

hi cavenlee  
  
day September 22 was a very clear sell... d1-h4.... you had been given enough pips for the week  
  
I do not use h1-h4  
  
I do not understand because you complicate your life with h4-h1

Hey Porfirio,  
  
I just want to let you know that you are a true genius like Einstein! You might not see it now but you have discovered the best entry method for counter-trend fractal trading and this can really get us in some very profitable trades with minimal draw down.  
  
Fractals have always been my favorite way of entering but for a long time I stopped using them. Thanks to you, I am getting back to using them and I'm glad I did!  
  
Thank you very much for your contributions to the Thread ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

It's time we stop entertaining ourselves and start realizing ourselves!

Yes, Cavenlee92 you are starting to understand it now, keep up the good work!  
  
I think if we use the D1/H4 combination we might be able to get in fractal swings earlier and be able to stay in longer.  
  
I'm going to try this:

  1. Wait for Fractals to appear on the Daily charts first
  2. After getting the signal, drop down to the lower 4 Hour charts and check out and confirm the Stochastics for proper OB/OS levels
  3. Wait for any pullbacks or retracement to complete (if necessary)
  4. Set My Pending Stop Order(s) in the direction of the current fractal from the Daily
  5. Then switch back to the upper/higher time frame chart {Daily charts} and hold my positions for several days until it looks like another opposite fractal forms again while monitoring the Daily chart
  6. Then rinse and repeat in the opposite direction [repeating steps 1-5] and ride the next fractal swing (trend leg) for more pips

It's time we stop entertaining ourselves and start realizing ourselves!

But yes, any of these chart combinations would be great:

  1. Monthly fractal signal appears then drop down to the Weekly for entry if Stochastics is Overbought/Oversold
  2. Weekly fractal signal appears then drop down to the Daily for entry if Stochastics is Overbought/Oversold
  3. Daily fractal signal appears then drop down to the 4H for entry if Stochastics is Overbought/Oversold
  4. 4H fractal signal appears then drop down to the 1H for entry if Stochastics is Overbought/Oversold
  5. 1H fractal signal appears then drop down to the 30M for entry if Stochastics is Overbought/Oversold

I would not go any lower than the 1H/30M combination if I was a scalper or day trader.  
  
But for me, I prefer longer term charts (Monthly, Weekly and Daily) and like to hold my positions for days, weeks and even months and collect as many pips as possible without looking at the charts and staring at the computer screen all day ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

hi cavenlee....AC... I don´t like now  
  
  
9 september was sell d1-h4 (look post)  
  
  
now...  
  
sale is good according to the rules...d1-h4  
BUT...  
I look for harmony in the graphics ... harmony in zigzag... harmony in fibo  
  
in this case the price has fallen much ... no harmony  
  
is not easy to explain in another language

Hi porfirio  
i think i understand what u said ,beside the rule we still need to consider the retractment of the trend whether is nice or not right?

Hi Porfirio,  
  
Could you explain the concept of your "z" filter and how do I know when to draw one on the chart and how does it help us?  
  
Thanks ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

you can draw z to confirm the entry ... I really do not use it  
  
look w1-d1-h4 (October 10)  
w1 Price out of ema10 ... will return to ema1o ... that point is tp  
  
look d1-h1-h4 ... (17october)  
d1 away from ema10... price will return to ema10 .... this point will be the tp

That may be a good idea and even with the Fractal method as well from Porfirio.

In my view placing a BuyLimit under the Green 3 Dot and vice versa for the RED 3 DOT is like catching a falling knife.

Even better. I prefer Stop Orders rather than Limit Orders.

I'm re-upping this quote from the thread starter Bob just to remind everyone of a great way to filter out false signals. Thanks to Bob, Taru and Porfirio and many others on this thread I have gained much needed insight.  
  
But the question is why did so many of the earlier contributors give up on this method and thread when it does indeed work?  
  
All you need is some sort of filters and use the higher time frames. I'm even considering taking what Porfirio has laid out with the fractals/stochastic combination and even starting from the MONTHLY chart and then drop down to the Weekly to look for OB/OS levels on the Oscillator and get even bigger profit targets.  
  
Don't give up when you are on the right track and don't let a few losing trades throw you off the path!

Yep, you are also right! I am in the process of putting something together and trying to help build on his methods. I just need more time to test it all and then I can come back and share what I have discovered...  
  
A few more tweaks and I will be set. I won't need to look at any more systems or methods. Whatever works and makes consistent pips I'm sticking with it and forgetting everything else.

Sorry sir, I have gone thr pages 60-72. I now realized I was not meant to have asked the question.

Hi, does anyone still use the Semafor trading method with success? I've read through every page today and am surprised this thread has had no replies for a long time. I particularly want to hear from Taru as his/her approach sounded good. Thanks!
