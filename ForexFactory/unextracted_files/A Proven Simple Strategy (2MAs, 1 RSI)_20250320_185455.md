Hello everyone, Its been a while since I have posted but I wanted to share a super simple system that has been proven profitable. I hope this will help some of you here on FF. I did not create this strategy and it is nothing new. Its often overlooked because it's so simple but often times the simplest strategies can be the best. I have modified the original trading rules a little bit to rules that fit my trading style a little better.  
  
_**DISCLAIMER: THIS IS NO GRAIL. I AM NOT CLAIMING THIS TO BE A HOLY GRAIL. THIS IS JUST A SYSTEM THAT WORKS, THAT IS ALL.**_  
  
_**Things To Keep in Mind:**_  
**1\. This is intended to be traded on Daily Charts. I will also post the results for other timeframes towards the bottom of the post(coming soon).**  
**2\. There is no Hard SL or TP to this system. I have not found any configurations using ATR or similar tools to place an SL & TP that improved the system. As a result I do not use one with this system and just following the signals. **  
**3\. This system is not perfect. As with all systems, it performs better on certain pairs during certain conditions. What really allows you to take advantage of the system and avoid this variance is diversifying the instruments you trade it on!!!**  
**4\. Test results used a fixed lot size that does not increase.**  
**5\. Tests were performed on 7 major USD pairs(EU, GU, AU, NU, UJ, UCHF, UCAD).**  
  
_**Thread Rules:**_  
**1\. Do not add additional indicators. You may adjust current indicator settings and share your results if you'd like.**  
**2\. If you are going to suggest changes to the system, please provide hard evidence to support why these changes are profitable or better.**  
**3\. Keep it friendly. Please no spam.**  
**4\. Again no one likes conjecture. Do not make statements or claims about this system or any other system in here if you do not provide proof for the claims you are making.**  
**5\. Have fun & keep learning!**  
  
  
_**Entry Rules:**_  
**Long:**  
1\. Price is above 200 MA.  
2\. Price is below 5 MA.  
3\. RSI(2) is below 5.  
  
**Short:**  
1\. Price is below 200 MA.  
2\. Price is above 5 MA.  
3\. RSI(2) is above 95.  
  
_**Exit Rules:**_  
**Option 1(This option is for people who just want to check the chart at the end of the day, This is the Option used in results below):**  
Exit at the close of the candle that touches the 5 ma.  
  
**Option 2(This is a better option for people who want to watch their trades like a hawk):**  
Exit as soon as price touches 5 ma.  
  
So as they say, the proof is in the pudding. Well, here is my pudding, along with some other peoples pudding.  
  
_**The Pudding:**_  
  
_**In House Pudding:**_  
The first batch of pudding I will show you is my batch. Although there are other studies done about this system which I will share below, it is always smart to test the system for yourself before you even think about using it.

_**Summary:**_  
Overall this system performed quite well over the last 5 years. As I mentioned above it is key to diversify when using this strategy or others like it because some pairs will perform others as market conditions change. Diversifying will combat this variance as shown in the results above.

_**Summary:**_  
As you can also see from these results, diversifying really helps this system by reducing the natural variance that will occur between individual pair performance.

Hi Sis.yphus,  
  
Thank you for sharing this system.  
  
This is my understanding of the system as introduced:

  1. Type : Trend following system, where trend is defined by MA(200)
  2. Entry : Entry on retraces captured by MA(5) and RSI(2).
  3. Exit : On touch of MA(5).

The concept is good.  
Entry is fine, although one condition -either MA(5) or RSI(2)- could be enough.  
  
However for the Exit, I think we can manage better exits. And this is what I will try to prove in the coming days.  
  
I am not sure if you generated these tests manually or using an EA,   
Anyway, I will make an EA (if you don't mind), with the same concept and different exit options and see if we can get better results.  
  
Best,  
  
Khalil

This is a quick EA to test the system.  
I've added few options, but the default settings are as per Sis.yphus rules.

Dear all,  
simple systems can be the most profitable.  
Abo, thanks for the EA. Would be interesting to see the results.  
Perhaps test the EA with a fixed SL/TP (TP being > than SL)?  
cheers

How about an SL set at 10 pips above highest price of closed candle (candle which broke the 5EMA). TP could be set at the end of next candle. Sure your risk/ratio will not always be 2:1 but it's simple to define and a quick exit.  
  
  
For those looking to ride the trend, maybe using a SL set at half of the last closed candles range and just simply move it at the close when you are setting up your next entries.  
  
See attachment  
  
Thoughts?

Please show us a super rigid/mechanical systems like this that does not use any indicators along with proof that system works. Most price action traders are king snake oil sales men. And its always so convenient how their systems can't be proven but they can work...

Again this is FIXED lot trading with a TINY account of 10,000. If you traded this system using a very large account(which most professional traders have money) you would have made a mint compounding your results.  
  
Also please show me a bank(U.S.) with 6% interests rate and I will quit investing all together, stick my savings in their and never work again....

With the lot sized used in the test you can trade all 7 pairs at the same time and not run into margin issues. In other words the same 10,000K can easily trade all 7 pairs at .1 lot size.

... Please read the thread. It is the second thing to keep in mind on the OP....  
  
**2\. There is no Hard SL or TP to this system. I have not found any configurations using ATR or similar tools to place an SL & TP that improved the system. As a result I do not use one with this system and just following the signals. **  
  
Also if that blue line is the 200 MA the trade you marked is invalid as price needs to close ABOVE the 200 and BELOW the 5. In the pic it is closing below both MAs**.**

I really like where you are going with this and think this could have some legs. Rather than getting in to a flame war with some of the guys/gals on here, just use their critisizm and develop/evolv your system... I've learned a lot of things about myself and have become a better person over the years from harsh critisizm. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Again, I like where you are going! Any other thoughts rgding SL's and TP's??

Hello Khalil!  
  
I personally have not found an SL that provides better results than not using one. And even with not using an SL the drawdown is still extremely low pair to pair. I do think a good one could be implemented as maybe a hard stop but then again the 5 MA catches up to the price very quickly.  
  
I am very interested in seeing what you find when using the SL. I am going to play around with the EA you posted and will share the results I find.

Hello Shemski,  
  
As I mentioned to Khalil, I have not found any useful SL that works and I think it is crucial that the TP the is exiting on the touch of the 5 min MA. Here are some statistics on SL(based on pip size and market spread & TP, so they do not directly apply to this strategy but they illustrate a point) that show the statistical disadvantages you face if you make them too small. This was posted on one of my old threads and it assumes the spread is .4(which most peoples is much higher so these numbers are much worse)  
  
_**Assuming Spread is .2**_  
(5 Pip Target for 1:1)  
1:.25 = 11 Pips For 5 Pips = 4 Pip Pay Out or 12 Pip Loss After Commissions/Spread. True R:R 1:.45 - 6% Win Rate Needed To Make Up.  
1:.5 = 7 Pips For 5 Pips = 4 Pip Pay Out or 8 Pip Loss After Commission/Spread. - True R:R 1:.71 - 8% Win Rate Needed To Make Up.  
1:1 = 3 Pips For 5 Pips = 4 Pip Pay Out or 4 Pip Loss After Commission/Spread. - True R:R 1:1.66 - 13% Win Rate Needed To Make Up.  
1:2 = 3 Pips For 9 Pips = 8 Pip Pay Out or 4 Pip Loss After Commission/Spread. - True R:R 1:3 - 8% Win Rate Needed To Make Up.  
1:3 = 3 Pips For 13 Pips = 12 Pip Pay Out or 4 Pip Loss After Commissions/Spread. - True R:R 1:4.25 - 6% Win Rate Needed To Make Up.  
1:4 = 3 Pips For 17 Pips = 16 Pip Pay Out or 4 Pip Loss After Commissions/Spread. - True R:R 1:5.66 - 6% Win Rate Needed To Make Up.  
1:5 = 3 Pips For 21 Pips = 20 Pip Pay Out or 4 Pip Loss After Commissions/Spread. - True R:R 1:7 - 5% Win Rate Needed To Make Up.  
  
(10 Pip Target for 1:1)  
1:1 = 8 Pips For 10 Pips = 9 Pip Pay Out or 9 Pip Loss After Commissions/Spread. - True R:R 1:1.25 - 6% Win Rate Needed To Make Up.  
1:2 = 8 Pips For 19 Pips = 18 Pip Pay Out or 9 Pip Loss After Commissions/Spread. - True R:R 1:2.37 - 4% Win Rate Needed To Make Up.  
1:3 = 8 Pips For 28 Pips = 27 Pip Pay Out or 9 Pip Loss After Commissions/Spread. - True R:R 1:3.5 - 4% Win Rate Needed To Make Up.  
1:4 = 8 Pips for 37 Pips = 36 Pip Pay Out or 9 Pip Loss After Commissions/Spread. - True R:R 1:4.63 - 3% Win Rate Needed To Make Up.  
1:5 = 8 Pips for 46 Pips = 45 Pip Pay Out or 9 Pip Loss After Commissions/Spread. - True R:R 1:5.8 - 3% Win Rate Needed To Make Up  
  
(20 Pip Target for 1:1)  
1:1 = 18 Pips For 20 Pips = 19 Pip Pay Out or 19 Pip Loss After Commissions/Spread. - True R:R 1:1.11 - 3% Win Rate Needed To Make Up.  
1:2 = 18 Pips For 39 Pips = 38 Pip Pay Out or 19 Pip Loss After Commissions/Spread. - True R:R 1:2.17 - 2% Win Rate Needed To Make Up.  
1:3 = 18 Pips For 58 Pips = 57 Pip Pay Out or 19 Pip Loss After Commissions/Spread. - True R:R 1:3.22 - 2% Win Rate Needed To Make Up.  
1:4 = 18 Pips For 77 Pips = 76 Pip Pay Out or 19 Pip Loss After Commissions/Spread. - True R:R 1:4.28 - 2% Win Rate Needed To Make Up.  
1:5 = 18 Pips For 96 Pips = 95 Pip Pay Out or 19 Pip Loss After Commissions/Spread. - True R:R 1:5.33 - 2% Win Rate Needed To Make Up.  
  
_**Assuming Spread is .4**_  
(5 Pip Target for 1:1)  
1:1 = 2.6 Pips For 5 Pips = 3.8 Pips Pay Out or 3.8 Pips Loss After Commission/Spread. - True R:R 1:1.92 - 17% Win Rate Needed To Make Up.  
1:2 = 2.6 Pips For 8.8 Pips = 7.6 Pips Pay Out or 3.8 Pips Loss After Commission/Spread. - True R:R 1:3.38 - 11% Win Rate Needed To Make Up  
1:3 = 2.6 Pips For 12.6 Pips = 11.4 Pips Pay Out or 3.8 Pip Loss After Commissions/Spread. - True R:R 1:4.85 - 10% Win Rate Needed To Make Up.  
1:4 = 2.6 Pips For 16.4 Pips = 15.2 Pips Pay Out or 3.8 Pip Loss After Commissions/Spread. - True R:R 1:6.3 - 8% Win Rate Needed To Make Up.  
1:5 = 2.6 Pips For 20.2 Pips = 19 Pips Pay Out or 3.8 Pip Loss After Commissions/Spread. - True R:R 1:7.77 - 6% Win Rate Needed To Make Up.  
  
(10 Pip Target for 1:1)  
1:1 = 7.6 Pips For 10 Pips = 8.8 Pip Pay Out or 8.8 Pip Loss After Commissions/Spread. - True R:R 1:1.32 - 8% Win Rate Needed To Make Up.  
1:2 = 7.6 Pips For 18.8 Pips = 17.6 Pip Pay Out or 8.8 Pip Loss After Commissions/Spread. - True R:R 1:2.56 - 6% Win Rate Needed To Make Up.  
1:3 = 7.6 Pips For 27.6 Pips = 26.4 Pip Pay Out or 8.8 Pip Loss After Commissions/Spread. - True R:R 1:3.63 - 5% Win Rate Needed To Make Up.  
1:4 = 7.6 Pips For 36.4 Pips = 35.2 Pip Pay Out or 8.8 Pip Loss After Commissions/Spread. - True R:R 1:4.79 - 4% Win Rate Needed To Make Up.  
1:5 = 7.6 Pips For 45.2 Pips = 44 Pip Pay Out or 8.8 Pip Loss After Commissions/Spread. - True R:R 1:5.95 - 4% Win Rate Needed To Make Up.  
  
As you can see by doubling the spread, the win rate needed to make up almost triples. So if you traded with a spread of 2 and a 10 pip stop on a daily chart, you are basically putting yourself at a minimum 20%+ disadvantage(in other words your winrate needs to be extremely high to trade a 10 pip stop system, especially on a daily chart). Again, these numbers are based on pip size and market spread & TP, so they do not directly apply to this strategy but they illustrate the point I am trying to make anyways hope it makes sense.

I agree, your win rate has to be very good but assuming you risk 1% of your portfolio per trade and using my above example, your SL would be around 25-28 pips. Your profit on that trade alone would've been around 145-150 pips. that is a 5-5.5% gain and at the end of the day your risk was only 1%/portfolio.  
  
I'll see if I can mess around with the EA and see what I can come up with...

I am getting a sell sign on both EUR/USD and Gold. I like both of those signals and by using my suggested SL's, I would set them here:  
  
EURUSD: 1.09945  
Gold: 1098.26  
  
I'll wait for [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") to thin out and take the trade a few hours after the open.

Good idea to wait for the spread to calm down. If you trade when the spreads are bad it will drastically change your results.   
  
I would recommend testing the strategy using your SL and TP idea and then reporting back the results. I may check it out and test it my self a little later today if I have time.

Will do! But again, shorting EURUSD and Gold is still a great gamble. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Yeah a big thing to keep in mind though, is when trading a strictly technical system, you need to take every trade generated as they come to get the true results of the system. Cherry picking the trades as you go will lead to quite a bit of variance in your performance, which can be good or bad.  
  
Sidenote: Haha thanks. The funny thing is though this thread will likely not get popular at all because it actually works but does not work good enough for most traders. Which then leads to the typical system hoping trader as they always are searching for something "better". These markets are already extremely brutal so sometimes it pays to just be good enough...

At the end of the day, if you expect, aim for or truely believe that you can make anything more than 10% a month you will not survive long. I'll take 6% YTD with low risk any day!  
  
I'll try to keep this thread alive and if it does die out just PM me, maybe we can work things out by ourselves.

Indeed This is because most traders don't have the large capital to see the magic in this. So the hunt goes on...

Again I do not recommend trading extremely high leverage.

My broker won't let me access data older than December 2015 (right now). Could someone run the EA on the EURCHF dated back to 2010? I'd love to see how it performed during the SNB's field-day... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

So, to trade this system, do we need at least $10,000, or could we use micro lots if we have less?

The EA was provided for testing purposes.  
Where to go from here depends on the thread opener (Sis.yphus).

My findings so far :

  1. The system is sound and can be applied to different time frames, although sys recommended Daily, my focus was mainly on H1 in order to get more trades.

EUR/USD Test H1 2015.

Best Entry :  
\- Open Long : RSI < lower level, while Price above Slow Moving Average  
\- Open Short : RSI > upper level, while Price below Slow Moving Average  
  
Best Exit (when none of SL, TP,Trailing Stop used)

The only problem is that this system, same as my Stochastic, has excelent results in 2015 but in the past it's not so good. I will try your setting evening.

Using a Stop Loss and Trailing Stop,  
and exiting on Trailing Stop instead of fast moving average,  
all other inputs are same as above,  
gave better results with less drawdown.

I will try it evening. I think we need better modeling quality. I have 90% from 2007. Especcially if you use TSL.

Hello Abokwaik, Very nice results!  
  
a few questions if you don't mind.  
  
1\. How were you determining your stoploss?(ATR?)  
2\. How does the trailing stop work?(Is it stepped so it moves every x pips, or is it fixed so it is constantly x amount of pips away from the market at most?)

Hey bro, can you please add compound interest filter to increase volume as acount increases, i think thats the last secret to this, compound interest has to be acording to ratio, meaning $10k=1lot $11k=1.1lot etc 

I am what Many Dream to be but only a few can achieve, im a part of the 1%

EDITED: Had bug in EA. Fixed so Updated results. I am still getting a lot more trades than you are.  
  
~~Hello Abokwaik,~~  
  
~~I am trying to replicate your results and am getting much different findings.~~  
  
~~I am using the same timeframe as you and it generates over 300 trades from Jan 2 2015 to Dec 30 2015 and the equity curve not very pretty.~~  
  
This is using a 7 & 200 MA, 7 RSI(20 buy level & 80 sell level), Spread is set to 30 and the modeling quality was 90%.

I used the ADX as my exit indicator, simply waited for it to trend down. Now on this trade, I just happened to be in a meeting at 3:00PM and mised my exit. Luckely, the trend continued down and I exited shortly after (around 4:30-45).  
  
Same thing with the second trade: BUND, I got greedy here and just kept my SL close and exited a little later than my sign confirmed.

I'm currently looking at the Dollar index on the H1 and hoping for a drop to about 12'250 followed by a nice rebound to12'280. Like a hawk, watching the RSI...

It could be really good to implement % lot size to see if results will be better.

One more trade which was closed out last night while I was sleeping. My SL was at 1% of portfolio and TP at 1.5%. If I was up and watching, I most likely would've closed at the closing of that second candle and grabbed another 40pips which would've had me at 1.6%/portfolio.  
  
All in all, I placed 9 trades yesterday, 6 of them were premature (that's why I won't post them) and was up with all but one of them. Another great day and I must say the system feels good. I might just use this as my primary - manual trading system. We will see.

Hello Sis.yphus..  
  
Thanks for sharing your strategy, which looks promising. Also thanks to Khalil bro for the inputs.  
  
I think I'm a dumb coz I didn't understand clearly about the exit rules ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f612.png?v=15.1)  
  
"Exit at the close of the candle that touches the 5 ma.  
  
Exit as soon as price touches 5 ma."  
  
Can you or anyone kindly post a screenshot of a trade pointing out the exits. Would be really helpful.  
  
Thanks in advance.

Success - It's not always what you see

**This is version 2 of the EA, with Variable lot option.**  
  
Risk Percentage is not included because SL is not fixed.  
So variable Lot size is simply calculated by multiply the "Balance (%) Auto Lot" input percentage by Current Balance and dividing by Required Margin.  
Example : Account Balance = 10,000. "Balance (%) Auto Lot" input = 6. Required Margin = 600.  
Var Lot Size = [(6/100)*10,000]/600 = 1.  
  
This the same test as the one in [Post # 54](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=8697827#post8697827), with Balance (%) Auto Lot = 6, to start with the same lot size that test started with which was fixed to 1.  
I have also added two other RSI levels, so now we have 4 levels. 2 for entry and 2 for exit. For this test I've set them the same to be comparable with the previous test.

so far would you say this is a good strategy or not, judging from your experience with EA's and the results we have?

The strategy enters on **retraces** in the direction of the **main trend**. So in principle it is good.  
However, there are 2 issues that can make or break the strategy.  
  
1\. Correct identification of the **main trend**. Using MA(200) is one way, but how reliable is it (on different time frames).  
2\. Correct entry on end of **retracement**. Using OB/OS levels is one way, but how reliable is it.  
  
Few ideas to consider :

  1. Delayed Entry :

    1. option 1 : Instead of entering once RSI is above/below OB/OS levels, we delay the entry until we spot RSI divergence in the direction of the main trend
    2. option 2 : Instead of entering once RSI is above/below OB/OS levels,we delay the entry until RSI is out of OB/OS levels in the direction of the main trend

  2. Main Trend Identification:

    1. This is a big issue, and might require multi-time frame analysis.

Your Modeling quality is much lower than his, the reason why is most likely because of the quality of tick-data he is using compared to yours. I am guessing, if you were to DL better quality tick-data, your performance would be much different!

Different Required Margin on EUR/USD.  
  
Required Margin is determined by Leverage:  
Required Margin = (Current Price/Leverage)*Standard Lot Units.  
My leverage is 200, Required Margin on EUR/USD currently will be (1.0912/200) * 100,000 = 545  
So when I set the variable lot Input to 6%, my starting lot was = (10,000*0.06)/545 = 1.1  
  
It seems that your lot size was less because your leverage is lower.  
If your leverage is 100. Required Margin on EUR/USD currently will be (1.0912/100) * 100,000 = 1009.  
So you need to set the variable lot input to 12%, so that your starting lot size is similar to mine.  
  
I hope it is clear.

As far as i know, modelling quality is just a matter of each broker pricing model and it wont affect the whole tested strategy, isnt it? <\-- not quite sure please correct me if im wrong.  
  
I just download the history data from my own broker history centre and this is the result from December 2007

If you factor in spread, slippage, news etc...... would you say this strategy is profitable overall? remember backtests dont factor those things in.

Not without resolving the 2 issues I raised earlier.  
  
Defining the major trend is not a simple job.  
Most indicators depend on a number of previous bars, which are not of equal size.  
Using range bars, or combining multiple time frames, for trend definition could help.  
  
Another way could be to set the system to trade Only Long, or Only Short based on one's techno-fundamental bias.

Problem is that you never know how the market will looks like in the future. With my setting it's profitable from 2007-2016. It's good. Of course, in 2007-2010 it could be better. But if we do optimization fot that years so it's not so profitable in 2014 and 2015. What is more important? Last two years or 8 years back? It's a question. My idea is to use 2-3 different setting on the same pair. All profitable from 2007-2016 but one will be more profitable in 2007-2010, one 2010-1014 and the last one 2014-2015. If you use it all together maybe it could work like hedging or something like that. What do you think about it?

For me as i learned to determine a major trend, i looked at D1/W1/MN1 candles and search for the _latest_ ABCD pattern. Either it makes a zigzag to make a lower low and lower high (downtrend) or it makes a higher high and higher low. I think this kind of logic is tangible for coding.  
  
For a minor trend, go to H4 timeframe and below and search the latest ABCD pattern( HH and HL) or (LH and LL). Once a pattern formed, its the trend!

Of course we never know my friend, but "every cow barn will smell the same over and over until the cow is replaced". We are looking the "red cable" that flowing through time to time in pricing especially forex market. That red cable is the main thing why Big boys e.g big banks are earning money time to time and increasing in growth. We need to have a rigid setting to make sure it will survive in any financial issues (global crisis, WW3, doomsday are out of factors of course).

Sir i think we are over thinking things here and trying to create a holy grail system which we all know doesn't exist instead of creating a simple system that will experience DD but overall will be profitable which is key, well with that said, let me rephrase my question to make it a little more accurate, looking at the beautiful backtests posted here, do you think it would have made at least similar results during the same months if it was traded live?

Definitely i agree with you! It costs me many $$$ to come a conclusion: a system with higher win rate does not guarantee a profitable system. All we need is a reasonable R/R and win ratio below 50% would be a sustain one

Each system will experience DD, nothing is 100%, all we need is consistency, a system that will experience some DD but get up and keep moving farward CONSISTENTLY, i dont mind loosing a few battles as long as i will win the whole war, so here we dont mind loosing battles as long as we will win the war, i thing changing and rearranging is the worst thing a trader can ever possibly do, always wanting to be right and over analysis, its a killer of progress, each time we experience DD we seek to optimize and change and in turn we shoot ourself in the foot because we inturn mess with the mathematics and the statistics, so we can never actualy be sure if something works or not because the variables within the strategies are always changing before we can even gather enough data for analysis, so all i wana know is will this perform similar to the backtests during a farward live tests, thats all that matters to me.

With regard to the tested pair, with testing settings: spread, slippage, re-quotes would not change the results to a loss.  
So if you ran the system on EUR/USD with my settings for 2015 you will end up with profit.  
  
BUT, is that enough ?  
  
In my opinion, (and this is applicable to any system), it is NOT.  
  
This was IN-SAMPLE Testing, with only 42 trades over only 1 year.  
  
Lets go out side the sample just a LITTLE bit, same pair, same settings, 2 years back.  
  
This is the test for 2013.

This is why I wrote my idea about bundle of settings. And runing it together. My settings I tested with data 2007-2016 and imho the results seems better. But probably we need someone with StrategyQuant or similar software because in MT4 there isn't possible to do this type of backtest.

Hello Khalil,  
  
Is it possible to separate the faster moving average to ema(Highs) and ema(Lows)? So that the EA can exit longs at ema(highs), exit shorts at ema(Lows).

though I'm no expert coder or tester, I think we need first to prove that the system works over different pairs and periods before tweaking the settings like lotsize or ema high-low.   
MA settings, Rsi settings, SL/TP/TS are the things we should look at.   
But first we need to make sure our test results are reliable (modelling quality, mismatches, journal errors....).  
All easier said than done...

Very good point.  
  
As I mentioned in the first post. What makes this system work well is when it is traded very diversely(on a bunch of different pairs or a basket) because it will perform better on certain pairs at different times. But if you trade a bunch of them at once they should average each other out and create a very smooth equity curve.  
  
As said by fti in another [thread](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=57639), "studies(or systems) can work in some market conditions all the time, all market conditions some of the time, but not all market conditions all of the time."  
  
This system or any system will not work on every pair all of the time. Thankfully with a properly designed system it doesn't have to and the pairs that work during certain times will pick up the slack of the pairs that are not working as well.

I am glad that you are interested in BT but what do you think we are doing here all the time? Beach voleyball? I spend a lot of hours/days with proven bactest of this strategy. Try it. Only EURUSD will take you few days of your live. It's not necessary to write here how we can make a quality backtest. It's for another thread. If you haven't any good reason to show us some improvement then just look, download and use it. I don't know how long have you been on forex market but there isn't any solid proof. Just history and prediction or hope of similar move. Do you have courage use it under this conditions?

I finally let the system run on auto today and got outstanding results. Will continue to front test for a week or two, then maybe go live.

No- the reason why the banks, institutions and hedge funds are the smart money and making money is they do not use technical analysis to generate trading ideas, but instead use it as a timing tool and filter... They have a systematic approach in gaining a trading bias. For the Forex markets it's understanding every detail about the countries - all the boring economic stuff that 99% of people won't look at, with out this fundamental knowledge you won't know where the economy is going or what factors are going to influence policy makers to change and intervene. If you understand this, then using technical analysis for timing and understanding where the smart money, excluding commercial hedging, is on certain currencies (net long or net short) you will be in the trade with the right bias, in the right direction, with the smart money and earlier before the dumb money reacts to the news; that's when the dumb money provides liquidity to get out. E.g) If you are reading the NFP and making a trading decision, or are even "surprised" vs. last months NFP, and believe what the retail brokers and news media tells you, you are already 3-4 weeks behind the banks and institutions on that figure and around 9-12 months behind on a trading bias.

Hi Shemski,   
I have some questions comparing your trades and the settings.  
  
\- The lot size is set to 3 but I see trades taken for 1,5 or other sizes.  
\- The Trailing stop (and shift) is set to 10 but you have a 5-digit broker. Shouldn't it be set to 100?  
  
BR.

Hi X  
  
Great eye!  
  
-I was initially trading 1.5 lots but my largest losses were only about 1%/portfolio so i decided to double the size.  
-Yes it should, but for some strange reason, 10 gave me the best results. Don't ask me why. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Have you been back/front testing the strat? If so, let me know what your thoughts are!  
  
I am currently trying to find the optimal variables for index trading. I'd love to set this system loose on the S&P, Dow, Nasdax, etc...

I will try to set it up next Monday.

Magic Number should be unique per PAIR instance.  
  
So for example, if you're using the EA on EU, EJ, GU, UC, AU, GJ you don't have to change the Magic Number, as these are different pairs.  
  
While if you're using the EA on EU M5, EU M30, EU H4 , then you'll need 3 different Magic Numbers. 

No guts, no glory

All trades were placed on H1. I honestly have not been able to find decent variables for other TFs? I'll play around with it this weekend.

Good to see sis back here.  
  
System is trading the exhaustion of the pullback/retracement against the longer term trend. The RSI settings of 95,5 are extreme over bought/sold levels. Statistically price can't travel much further...... unless it is a true reversal. Also, RSI has a tendency to get stuck at the top/bottom of its range, that's why Blau modified it to create the TSI.  
  
Agree with the TF issue as on a D1 chart you are basically trading when price is above the weekly (MA5) level vs roughly the yearly (MA200) trend. On lower TFs the system is going to be a lot more sensitive to individual market sessions and the intraday volatility of individual currency pairs. May be harder to calibrate the same MA settings to hold across a basket of currencies on lower TFs. Dunno, just speculating here. Have not tested anything. Nothing wrong with the logic of the system as people's testing have shown. I only trade the T1/M1 and measuring exhaustion points for either impulse moves or retrenchments are key me.

Statistically price can't travel much further...... unless it is a true reversal. Also, RSI has a tendency to get stuck at the top/bottom of its range, that's why Blau modified it to create the TSI. Agree with the TF issue as on a D1 chart you are basically trading when price is above the weekly (MA5) level vs roughly the yearly (MA200) trend. On lower TFs the...

Thanks for the input. I've spent a good 10-15 hours crunching the numbers this weekend and have noticed that certain TF's work better on ccertain pairs. What stuck out the most was the fact that all of my best backtesting numbers came from M15 or M30 charts and not one of the indices or commodoties setups were NOT on a M15 or M30 chart. Just something to keep an eye on. I really do not feel like listing every single pair, commodity and TF I am front testing but for the non-lazy, it is not hard to find the "sweet spot".  
  
Good luck this week everyone! Cheers

Hi, I have always been a fan of the KISS principle and the rules for this simple trading strategy I believe is all that is required to be a successful . I shall be trading 24 currency pairs from Monday using the settings from the EA supplied that is how confident I am of this gift that has been given. Cheers to the trader who started this thread and to all contributors.  
All the best from a NZ trader.

I think you definitely need a SL or TS with this system.   
Because: if you go long when price is below the fast MA and price keeps going down, it will remain below the fast MA and this could be painful in case of a waterfall.   
So we need a SL or TS instead of the MA exit rule I think.

The bias is more towards win in trend trading.   
  
loss will happen   
  
the fast is you loss manager  
  
greed ruins the statistic and DD make pain in greed.  
  
the MA is dependent on price not the other way around.  
  
Test it first. Then comment and show a chart of your findings

He means the issue of not using an SL & TP on this system is not really an issue if you are risking the proper amount per trade. The 5 MA will catch up to price quickly in all conditions, especially if you are trading with the 200 MA.

Test for no shorter that 3 months per setting. Test the original setup as well. Just let them run on a free VPN and check it in a month. The strategy tester basically lets you know the EA is performing as expected. Now throw it on demo or a very micro account and let the market give what it gives... Pay attention the spread.  
  
  
Green pips brother!

Is this avoidable? Did anyone else had this trade?  
Probably a news release...  
FYI, settings M15 20/5 MA, RSI (2) 80/20, no SL/TP/TS, exit of fast MA  
I added the MA 5/20/200 as well as the RSI (2) levels 5/20/80/95  
The trade would have been taken with 200/5 MA and 95/5 RSI too, but a bit later.  
Happy testing fellows.  
PS: Maybe an exit on cross of the slow MA (200 in that case) would be a beneficial safety net. To be tested...

Yes, Xman. It's avoidable. There is an option to close on cross of slow MA.

Today I have been testing Ea on small live accounts and there are big differencies in profitability. On account activetrades with good [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") (EU around 0.7pip) is in profit today. On account F4U with normal spread (around 1.5pip) it's not in profit with the same trades on eurusd. Slippage is on activetrades usually also better.

Hi abokwaik!  
Thanks for the EA. I test it with a basket of 7 pairs. Settings as post 82 but 30 min. Close basket with 100 pips tp/sl. Tested it for 2 days. So long everything is god, 3 basket closed with tp. But when does ea takes 3 orders? Today 3 orders whas executed with gu, the first when rsi(7) breaks 20, with the second order whas rsi(7) below 20.  
Best wishes

Thanks Abo,   
I modified my settings: testing on 6 pairs now, 15m TF:  
SMA 200/5, RSI (2) 80/20 (i find 95/5 to extreme for now), exit at fast MA cross or slow MA opposite cross.  
I'll post updates.

It takes a new long position on each new bar open, as long as rsi is < 20 and total orders < max orders.

Abokwaik, Apparently the the trade will not close on the same candle as the one it opened with (i.e. the open candle crosses and closes on the other side of the fast MA).  
Can you confirm that it will wait for the close of the candle after the open candle, based on the EA coding?

It's been mentioned that various set files do not do well in certain years, 2013 in particular. With over 100 backtests, I  
was able to find a set that was able to make a good profit in 2013, 2014, and 2015, as opposed to prior sets that  
failed to prove robust enough to make money each of the three years. I also found that running the EA on M5 was key  
to getting things right.  
  
Modelling quality is 90%, with no mismatched chart errors, for the year 2013. No claims being made as to how it would  
do live, but it could be a good starting point.

yes as you move down in time frame the degree to which spread affects you trading drastically increases as shown in the example of the first page(one of my post on there).  
  
This is why if you choose to trade on smaller timeframes, you need to make sure you only trade when the spread is small enough for you to still make a profit.  
  
Contrary to popular belief, beating the markets is quite easy. What is really hard to do is beat the cost of trading...  
  
A lot EA's are profitable if the spread is small enough.

I wanted to share a pic to explain what I mean by variance and why you should really diversify when trading.  
  
As I said, this system, like all systems, will perform differently during different market conditions for each pair.  
  
Take a look at the picture below and image each line represents the trading results from 20 different pairs we trade.  
  

Attached Image

![](/attachment/image/1841089?d=1453942464)

  
  
The black solid trend line represents what your equity would look like as the performance of all the pairs plays out(the green lines are just some Deviation intervals to show where we can expect most of the pairs performance to land).  
  
As you can see we have nice growth by diversifying and averaging the returns of all the pairs.  
  
If we traded only 1 pair, we could expect results that look like any of the lines representing the pairs performance. Yes we could see very good results while we trade only 1 pair, but we could also see horrible results. In fact you could experience losing results multiple times over using a profitable system. And If you were to see these horrible results while only trading 1 pair at a time, you would say this system is BUNK! But in reality you are just experience a very bad period of variance. In order to reduce the amount of variance in performance you need to DIVERSIFY!

This could have ended badly. If the slow SMA got hit it would have exited with a loss on all trades. Now more or less BE.  
Max number of trades was set to 6 (per pair).  
For the rest, running well.  
Since my exits are the cross of fast MA (usually a profit) and slow MA (usually a loss), and since the slow MA is usually further away from current price than the fast, I guess my losses will be larger.  
We'll see if the %winning trades can make up for that. For now, they do: about 65-70% trades are won, about 200$ profit with fixed 0,1lots after 100 trades or so over 24h on 6 pairs.

I would not recommend opening more than 3 trades per setup. Once you move past 3 it can get dangerous and like you mentioned your losses will seriously stack up. I also have never used entry level of 80 or 20( I prefer 5 and 95) so I can not comment on how well it will perform. I am very interested to see how it plays out for you though so please keep us updated!

Almost all 2-3 days profits were lost with this sudden move in USDCHF and EURUSD .  
I thought that the exit on the slow MA occurred at the cross, but apparently it occurs at the close of the candle that crossed (or even opening of the next one).  
If we want (I do ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1))) the Slow MA to be our safety net, then the EA should be programmed to exit at the cross (or we should work with a fixed SL or TS, but that's more difficult to determine).

You mean slowMA. Yes, there's a problem  
It never closed past the fast MA, so not closing of the trade.

EA closes a Sell trade if candle close below fast ma. And closes a Buy trade if candle close above fast ma.

The close trade when candle closes on other side of fast MA is ok, but as a safety net and to avoid sudden large moves the trade should better close at the moment it _crosses_ the _slow_ MA (not at the candle closure).  
I think...

Thanks Abo, that would be great.  
I think the system makes sense, but trading it with real money without a SL will not be easy psychologically. That's why I prefer to have a safety net in place. And waiting for the candle close beyond the slow MA may be too late. Maybe closing at the cross will drastically decrease the win ratio, but we won't know until we test it out.  
So, I look forward to the update and will test with same settings. Then depending on the results, play around with RSI and number of open trades, if needed.  
Meanwhile, enjoy your weekend. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

So far i noticed that better trades are when price are far from the fast ma  
Maybe add a distance filter.

I noticed that too. Currently I am developing an EA, that includes both envelope and standard deviation channel options.

Nice work Abo!! Thanks a lot.  
Will start testing next week.  
For info (in case others are testing too) I will test following settings:  
TF15min, 6 pairs, 200/5 MA, RSI (2) 80/20, exit on fast MA (H/L) and slow MA (cross), fixed lot size, max 3 open trades/pair, no fixed SL/TP/TS.  
Cheers.

Great work Khalil, thank you for your efforts.  
  
It is good to see that the change has improved the Profit factor.  
  
One question:  
How do you exit without price touching fma? Any stop loss level? or any other method?

Great work. I've been playing around with this system for a few weeks with some decent results. i'm in the phase of finding out which TF works best forme along with a few minor tweeks.  
  
Why don't we try to put together a coordinated team and asign certain people to certain duties? For example, I'd be willing to front test 5 or 6 majors, along with Gold and Oil, maybe the Dax and S&P on a H1 chart with the following variables:  
  
EMA's; 20 & 5  
RSI; 2, 95 and 5 along with 2, 92 and 8  
  
One side note, this system CAN NOT live be when [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") are wide. I've noticed during the past few weeks that Sunday and Friday evening entries have killed me!  
  
Good luck everyone this week!

Hi all,  
I like the EA it is nice and simple and seems to work.  
Below I have been doing some tests on the EUROUSD and GPBJPY.  
Below are the settings I was using on the H1 and the results are good but there is an issue on the SL's not being able to be applied.  

Attached Image

![](/attachment/image/1844577?d=1454337634)

  
  
Here are the results and they are fairly good based on the numbers and the percentage of trades is also good based on the qty of trades.  
EUROUSD

Here you can see the graph and where the losses come in and the SL's don't get applied from what I can see.

As you can see in July the issues come in and wipe out allot of the profit in a few trades.

Is there no way to get the trailing SL to update faster not when the candle closes?

Why are you using a 78 and 9 RSI Entry level? Shouldn't that either be 78 and 22 or 91 and 9??

I like this system, it is very promising, there is some nice catches, but you need to close some trades manual like this one EURAUD from +50 pips close on loss.

This is an optimization test on EUR/USD 2015/2016 H1, SL between 100 points (10 pips) and 1000 points (100 pips) with step of 100 points (10 pips)

Would be nice to have time frames so we can limit trading times, most of the losses that come are in trades that happen in early hours of the morning when ideally we can just turn off trading.  
Also the [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") at this time would not be good in any case so we wouldn't want to trade then.  
Hard to back test properly with out this.  
  
Quite interesting how much of an effect the stop losses are making. It is really hard to know what stop loss to put in place.  
  
Look below.  
This is with starting capital of $500.  
USDJPY

36H results from setting in post 178: not good.  
I'll go back to my original settings which were good (% winning trades) except for some large losses i.e. use SMA instead of EMA (and closing price, not H/L) and only using the cross for the slow (and close for the fast).  
So: TF15min, 6 pairs, 3 trades/pair max, no SL/TP/TS, **SMA** 200/5, RSI (2) 80/20, exit on **close fast** SMA or on **cross slow** SMA.  
If that doesn't work, the initial good results were due to luck... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1)  
(not for myself: starting at 4253 $)

Hi abokwaik,  
  
pls, can you modify time filter. There is some problem if start time is bigger than stop time. I mean - I would like to test EA only during asia session. I am from Europe and Asia session for me is from 23 to 5, during night.   
  
When I try to set start at 23 and stop at 5 it doesn't open any trade but when I set from 1 to 5 it works.   
  
Thanks  
  
David

Sir,  
  
Firstly thanks for all sharing.  
Could you, add a optional TP point.  
  
For example,  
  
If 5 & 20 EMA cross then it will TP.  
( EMA or SMA etc and value things are optional it ) 

Working,to be the best !

Great.;-)  
  
If we use it only during asia session the results are better, lower DD and nice equity..

Sorry, since this is not one of my own systems, I don't keep multiple version source files.  
Here is a compile of the latest and only version I have.  
You can play with the inputs to match the one from post # 7.

I'll go back to my original settings which were good (% winning trades) except for some large losses i.e. use SMA instead of EMA (and closing price, not H/L) and only using the cross for the slow (and close for the fast). So: TF15min, 6 pairs, 3 trades/pair max, no SL/TP/TS, SMA 200/5, RSI (2) 80/20, exit on close fast SMA or on cross slow SMA. If that doesn't work, the initial good results were due to luck... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1) (not for myself: starting at 4253 $)

UPDATE: Settings look better. Lots of small wins, some bigger losses though when price moves straight to the slow MA. Will limit the number of trades to 1 per pair. Should be safer.  
(Starting at 4250$)

Hi Acana, I am forward testing but am not very skilled at doing reliable backtests (knowing that the data from MT4 are not always accurate).  
I noticed you had 99% modeling quality and no mismatched bars!  
Could you maybe backtest with my live settings on TF15min? If not, no pb.  
BR.  
  
TF15min, SMA 200/5 (simpleMA-CLOSE price), RSI (2) 80/20 (95/5 may be worth testing too), 0,1 fixed lots, max 1 trade per pair  
Open signal = CLOSE of candle  
Close signal = CROSS of slow SMA or CLOSE past the fastMA  
No TP/SL/TS

Acana, can you back test these settings for me and see if you get different results.  
I was hitting an average of around 65% win rate on back testing and you can see my win rate now is 45%.

Hi, which TF do you test? From my backtests only H1 is profitable. Lower TFs doesn't work with any setting. I have been testing on live account TF H1 with EURUSD and EURJPY. But there wasn't any signal last few days.

What kind of MAs are used for this? Simple, exponential, smoothed...or?  
  
Another question is when does a new candle begin on the daily chart? What time and what time zone?  
  
Thanks.

Update after 36h: Breaking even since starting this strat 72h ago (max 3 trades/pair), small profit since reducing max number of trades to 1/pair.  
Too early to draw conclusions.  
Will continue the test next week with same settings.

Hi, 17% profit in 5 years is probably unusable. Can you try my settings for EURUSD TF H1? I have 90% data so BT from you will be more proper. Thanks

Acana, Looking at your 1H chart I have a couple of questions:

ok, this is result as your request base on what you quote picture is default setting on EA  
maybe more easy if you attach setfile, so i just load to EA ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

for floating loss maximum, you can see at   
*) Absolute drawdown — the largest loss is lower than the initial deposit value  
*) Maximal drawdown (%) — maximal loss of the local maximum in the deposit currency and in percents of the deposit

Hello,  
  
i did a quick backtest from 1st january 2015 until today, only gbp/usd daily tf.  
200sma, 5sma, rsi2. (price above 200 sma and rsi below 10 buy, exit only if the price closes above the 5sma or below 200sma; price below 200sma and rsi above 90 sell, exit only if the price closes below the 5sma or above 200sma)

I know that one year is very short time for backtesting, anyway i cannot do much manually. If i trade around 20 pairs daily tf, the average return would be quite nice, what do you think?

(1) Drawdown% is high --> dangerous. (2) Max Drawdown > net profit --> risk > return.

Yes actually you are right, not nice idea. I am back testing with your EA that I like very much, congratulation! Nice job!Until now I see that the profitable time frames are only 4hr and daily tf.I will post some back test soon.$yl

i just did a backtest with same settings and "only" got this result. Is there really such a big difference between 90% and 99% modeling quality?

Uuuuh, let's start with the variable "spread". Huge difference between current and your 30. Don't want to waste my time comparing the rest. Maybe you can do that... As a matter of fact, you should've already done that.

Hello,  
  
is it possible to risk a fix percentage of the capital, compounding it?  
For example i would like to risk 1% per trade of the actual capital. I cannot do that.

Hello,  
  
i did some backtest on daily tf, rsi2 (90-10), from 2010 until today, the results are pretty much randomly... not so promising... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1)

Model quality: point of control (since we open and close the trade at the close of the bar, i don't think would be differ from "every tick".  
Time span... what do you mean?

Just post the complete strategy report rather than screenshots of the MT4's graph.

yes its make big different, even just 0.9% its make different,  
and watch your data spread, my data conversion for alpari that have average spread 1.4 pips, lowest under 1 pips

The test was made with a start of 400 euro, trading with 0,01 lot. I didn't save the report, the graph speak very well.

I see 60-80 trades but those trades couldbe over a time span of 12 years or 12 hours. That is what I mean by time span and by model quality, imean tick data quality.

From 2010 until today, model quality is "point of control, not the very accuraty tick data".

Looking at the charts, the rational of this strategy seems odd. You are betting on price going _away_ from the long MA.  
Why not try this:  
buy when price below slow MA and RSI <x (e.g 5) (close when RSI >y (e.g. 80))  
sell when price above slow MA and RSI >a (e.g. 95) (close when RSI <b (e.g. 20))  
If you look at the charts, it seems to work...  
  
It would require another EA since this one buys when price is above long MA.  
Just something to think about.  
I'm sorry if this is off-topic (if someone knows such an EA, please post the link, thx)

Hi Abokwaik,  
  
I have some problem with EA on live account. It doesn't open trade on Friday and I found in log message about problem with lot size. I have 2% in setting, with 0.0 fixed lot size. Strange is that in backtest it works but in live forward no..  
  
Do you have some idea why?   
  
I use version of EA without time filter..  
  
Thanks

Hi Xman,  
  
The logic of this strategy is the following:  
  
1) Trade with trend (Slow MA)  
2) Locate drawbacks (Price between slow and fast MA)  
3) Locate over bought/sold markets with RSI 

When trading: "Empty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water."

Thanks Shemski, I get it now (I made the stupid assumption that price tends to revert to the mean, when in fact it's the mean that follows the price).  
So, in essence it makes sense, we just need to have a better risk/return%.   
The TP at the cross or close of the fast MA is usually only a few pips away since the price is never far away from a 5MA. So profits are small. While losses, when using the slow MA may be bigger.  
Maybe we don't even need the fast MA. When price is above the slow and RSI plunges, we go long.  
So maybe we can test a fixed TP/SL (1:1 ; 1,5:1 or 2:1 ratio). 15/10pips, 20/10, 30/15....?  
Any suggestions from anyone? I'm willing to forward test based on 'promising' backtest results.

Impressive for a diversified strategy. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Would like to test the longest back-test possible. Preferably 30 years.  
  
Not sure how to do this yet, but would also, like to test this on as many unrelated currency pairs as possible on the same account at the same time...To diversify.

Do you have stats for each pair? My BT for other pairs with this setting is not so good. Just EURUSD is very profitable.. And EURUSD is very good with my setting as well.

I have a strange one not sure if any one can assist why this would happen?  
I am testing the same system on 3 different brokers from 3 different locations on virtual servers I own.  
I have only just turned on [OANDA](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile") and when I turned it on it took a trade for NZDUSD where all the criteria were not met.  
So the price was below fast and above slow, but it was not below RSI low. The trades were not made on my other two brokers.

Any idea how that could happen, will keep monitoring it.  
Let me know what you think?

Just having a look at what is happening with one of my trades which are currently in action with Supa's Set file.  
Below you will see my screenshot showing the Slow MA, red dotted line. If we had the option enabled to exit on crossing Slow MA then we would have been out of this trade. But maybe Supa wouldn't have won on other trades that crossed the Slow MA so it is hard to tell what to do here but lets wait it out and see where it closes?  
Supa, Let me know what you think if you have been watching your trades have you seen go bad like this and swing from this?  
I see it has started to swing which is quite interesting to watch.

[Quote = SpencerBizze; 8747867] Sólo echar un vistazo a lo que está sucediendo con uno de mis operaciones que se encuentran actualmente en la acción con el archivo Conjunto de Supa. A continuación podrás ver mi pantalla que muestra la MA lenta, la línea de puntos de color rojo. Si tuviéramos la opción habilitada para salir al cruzar lenta MA entonces habríamos estado fuera de este comercio. Pero tal vez Supa no habría ganado en otras rutas que cruzaban el MA lenta por lo que es difícil saber qué hacer aquí, pero permite esperar y ver donde se cierra? Supa, Déjame saber lo que piensa si ha estado viendo sus operaciones has visto ir mal como éste y el swing de esto? Veo que ha comenzado a oscilar, que es bastante interesante de ver. {Image} [/ quote]  
  
  
Indeed Spencer,   
to me it has happened to me the same thing in the GU today .   
The truth is that yesterday evening gave very good results yielded 8 winners 1 miniloser , very good!

Ok, I 've been playing around with this EA for the last couple of days and live demo trading .  
I'm currently testing following strat that 'kinda' looks good but it's still too early to tell.  
I tried to backtest in excel and it seems ok but I still need to verify my formula's ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
The idea is, go with trend (200 SMA), entry based on RSI, fixed SL (15pips), TP based on RSI.  
  
Maybe someone can backtest these settings ....?

You can calculate let say 5% of your capital in pips and put it in the setting just to be sure that in the worst case you lose that amount of money leaving enough room to let the setup works,Anyway in my backrest that file.set doesn't give good result, I am trying to play with the setting and time frame in order to have better results,Syl

**It's a very good system. It shows realy good results in some pairs with some settings, but still need some modifications.**  
**My set is with 5 max open orders.**  
**_First modification:_**  
_If EA open more than 2 orders next orders to be twice more than first two._  
**Example:**  
_If 1 and 2 open orders are with lot size 0.01 next 1,2 or 3 to be 0.02._  
_Or if first two orders are with 1% from the account size the next orders should be with size 2%._  
**_Second modification:_**  
Will be good if have minimum distance between orders.  
**Example:**  
When EA open order, the next open order should have minimum distance in pips from the first open order.

Hi Antonio,  
  
Would you mind taking a screen shot of your settings. The reason I ask is because I tried to replicate your last few results (backtest), but am unable to get the same results.  
I downloaded the zip file from post 284, but am obviously doing something wrong.  
Thank you.  
  
Regards

Here is the account loss with no SL in 2013 using Suppa .set... so need stop loss.  
  
Whoever can code it and add Swing Stop Loss is the best option for this.

Lol of course you need SL.  
Your SL and TP is _**EXIT on Fast MA**_.  
And the most distant orders 3,4 and 5 will have max profit and less loss.

Finally some one else gets that just because you not using a fixed SL does not mean there is no SL...  
  
Also I do not recommend opening so many orders(more than 3) unless you entries are less likely to occur(will post more on this in a bit with some pics).  
  
Im glad to see people realizing that some of the simplest systems can provide a very nice edge. No fancy indicators, no black box code, etc. Just what the "evil" broker gives you.

Not enough. What if market drops 200 points in 10 min, Fast MA will not get in time to stop u out  
  
Post 313 at the end of the graph had 230 points Stop out...see last entry below

There is other filters too in that EA that you can use for SL and TP.  
Use _**Exit on cross opposite slow MA**_ for example.  
I can give you idea for other filter too.  
_**If all conditions are met, but previous closed candle is in oposite direction EA should wait till previous closed candle is in that direction and then open order.**_

_**Things to Consider When Changing RSI Settings:**_  
I have noticed a lot of you have been playing around with the RSI period setting and have been having some good results. Something I want you to consider when changing the RSI settings and levels you enter at is how frequently they are likely to occur. Since we are trading with the trend(200 MA), if at any point in time when price is above the MA, we look at the frequency distribution of the RSI there will also be a fat tail towards the higher readings(lower readings if below 200MA).  
  
So we know that when we are trading with the trend long, we are looking for pull backs in the RSI towards the lower numbers, the signals that are least likely to occur. You want to get in the market where it goes least often(lower RSI Reading) and get out where it goes most often(Average of price in this case). Statistically and logically this is a very sound method.  
  
Now lets look at some RSI readings starting with the original RSI setting of 2 for a period where price was moving down overall.

As we can see there are a total of 3747 RSI readings in this example 247 of which would be valid entry signals based on the original rules I posted. Roughly 6%.  
If you use levels lower than 95 you will get a lot more entry signals many of which will be back to back. This is why I said its important to understand how often they are likely to occur before you decide you are going to add every time they occur.  
  
Here is how the RSI is distributed for a few different settings all where the price is decreasing overall.

This is why I did not want to post fancy charts exploding with results using high leverage and why I still do not put charts like that in the original post. I had to though as no one took it seriously. Reduce your leverage dude. Trading a system like this, unless you are using a tiny account that are okay blowing, Id recommend risking 1% every 100 pips price runs against you. So if you have $1000.00, you would trade .01 lots per entry.  
  
Slow safe money means low risk, and you will need a bigger balance to start making real money from it.   
Fast dangerous money means high risk and you will possibly lose it all at any point. If this is how you like to trade you need to approach it using the Saints Free Account Method.

Of course you will blow your account.  
In forex trading most important thing is money managеment. Your took to much risk with small account on backtest.  
And that you blow your account with your settings does not mean will blow with every settings. You need to find the right one.  
I found these that are good for me and for that i give ideas for other options in that great EA.

Yea 3 orders is a good option too.  
And still the last 3-rd order, if is twice much more than previous 2 will have max profit, if deal is on profit and less loss, if go against you.  
And, if there is filter for minimum pips distance between orders will be good too.

I hear you about money management, I started with 1 lot per $10,000, 2nd trade was 2nd lot i guess....it is not that bad leverage  
  
Here it is with 0.6 lot per $10,000...look in the middle drop 30% of the account

You are using 6 times more leverage than I said... Reduce it to The proper amount I recommended and that loss would be less than 5%.

and then you will be 120(hopefully healthy![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) also) years old to make few bucks....  
  
I do not think 0.5 lot per trade per $10,000 is too much, but you get 30% drop on the account on 2 trades  
  
  
Here is the performance of the Suppa and actually best setting that worked great in 2015, during 2011 - 2013(3 years)at 0.5 lots per $10000...unfortunately waste of 3 years

This is also an example of why you need to trade it on many pairs. Instead of trading 1 pair at .6 lots, trade 6 pairs at .1 lot.  
  
  
its a fact most system will not work in all markets all the time. Again why you need to diversify. While you focused on one pair for 3 years that was flat, many other pairs out performed it during the same period. If you traded all of them you would have ended up with a nice smooth equity curve.

combine the results of the charts on the first post and there you go. 7 currency pairs all including 2011-2013. Non compounding the results are great. Compound them they are even better. Add more pairs to the basket and it gets better.

There are good results with some pairs, but sometimes, when you use more than 1 max open orders, the system open almost on the same price 2, 3 or 4 orders, so we need that option too in the system - the next open order should be not less than certain pips distance from previous one, depend from the time frame.

Hello Abo,  
I think there is a bug:  
The EA opened 3 ordered on EURGBP but it closed only 2 of them.  
See chart.  
Any idea why?

EURUSD 30 minutes tf, unusual setup, but since 2012 works great. Anyway 200% profit in three years is very low profit. But if you see the drawndown, it is not big, i think we can use many different charts, each one with the EA with proper setting, in this case we will have good result in terms of percentage and low risk...?  
  
By mistake i wrote 30min instead of 1hr. This setting is for EURUSD 1HR TF.

Hello Wang ,  
who will , I am no master , hopefully .  
  
I think this system works best TRUE validating the option " Stop on opposite slow MA " as said before other contributors.  
There are currently two open trades evil that had been cut with this small change (EURUSD and EURAUD) .  
I think do not greatly affect the results.  
  
What is your opinion?  
Regards.

Hi Spencer,  
Today was a day that the trends have been very long, this method does not escape.  
All operations at a loss.  
I hope it is because he has been partying in the US and that he has spoken to Mr. Dragui and normal days work well ( I hope)  
What happened to the attached image EURAUD happened in 3 more pairs , so diversify at least this day I think it was not worth much .

I agree will be interesting to watch the EA trade up again. I was sitting at 20% profit after 3 days now 16% loss. So was a loss of 36% over the weekend and yesterday. I think a trailing SL of 50 pips would help to reduce the damage of the long trending market and I looked at all large winners should not have been effected. Had a few 200 pip losses which we would want to get rid of going forward. Let me know what you think. You can look at my trade explorer to see what I mean. The gambler is the one trading this way since the 10th of this month. I also want to look how many trades of the same pair were running at the same time where I was winning is required so we can drop the number trades down from 5. As when it is a slow trend in the wrong direction it always seems to open the 5 trades which are always loses. I want to test some additional filters as I think we need something to help us.

Been looking looking back at the trades and a trailing SL would have helped allot more then hurt, maybe with a small shift. Just a thought, maybe a high impact news trigger needs to be included so when high impact news is going to happen in the next 30mins and or based on volume growth over a duration the ea shortens the trailing SL to 10 or 20. So we have a fixed trailing SL of 60 which gets shortened and no new trades can be made. I was reading another thread about someone who was implementing the same on his EA, I have asked him some questions on what ended up working.

Abokwaik, just wanted to check up how does the stop loss shift work. If I set it to 0 will it shift based on the original price?  
It looks like it might be doing something strange, in my tests. I have the trailing SL shift on 0 and the TL on 50.

It doesn't look like the Trailing SL is working.  
I have set the Trailing SL to 50 pips and the shift to 0.  
Tried the shift on 1 not much of a difference.  
  
You can see this is doing well, until it gets a trade which is trending along which eventually wipes the account because Trailing SL doesn't apply.

Ignore draw down and profit as the account gets wiped by three trades, two of which should have been closed much earlier by the trailing SL from what I can see.  
  
Look at below at trades 101 and 100, these are the two orders that wipe the account.

Hello Spencer,  
I have also noted that trading yesterday , were in positive trading for a while. One idea is to have also used a closure of all operations when you reach a certain level of profit that you take notice .  
Once they are closed, it is more likely that no longer obtain new conditions RSI and SMA and not re-enter until later .  
For example, a 2% profit account and all operations would close , they are as they are , making sure that 2% positive in your result.  
It is clear that there must be stop and trailing stop, but the system can leave the account to zero.  
Regards.

It is not clear what feature uses the system (I mean what kind of effect it trades). Because MAs only intersection is not a justification for the system IMHO (but more like a random set of indicators)

Hello fellow traders , I have a question. With any trading system "Just using a trailing stop loss of say 20 pips with a stop loss of 1% make sense ?"

I have been testing further with the Trailing SL and can't understand what is happening, is there something I am missing?  
It has some effect but not what I would expect.  
Have I set something incorrectly below?  
  
  
Here is a screenshot of a set file for back testing:

These are the results, and if you look at draw down and profit they look bad.  
But then if you look closer the win ration is 86% which is good.  
consecutive wins is 20 which is very good  
consecutive losses is 3 which is also not bad

The below in the graph is can see it is wiped quickly by three trades which I am guessing are the consecutive losses.

Hi Spencer,  
  
As per your settings your only exit option is the trailing stop.  
BUT the trailing stop well get activated ONLY if price moves in your favor for the number of pips set in trailing stop, and this does not always happen, so in the last trade price went against you all the way, trailing stop was not activated as price never gone in your favor for 50 points.  
  
You need to set at least another one exit option in addition to trailing stop.,  
For example a Stop Loss, or Exit on MA ... etc,  
  
Kindly let me know if this is not clear.  
  
Regards and Green Pips,  
  
Khalil

Thanks Khalil, make sense now. Sorry I am still learning.  
Is it possible to set a SL initially and then over ride by Trailing SL going forward if the price rises above purchased price?  
Or does you EA do this by default if both are set?

Yes, it does.  
  
For example :   
  
If you set SL tp 100 points, and Trailing Stop to 50 Points.  
Then if price moves 100 points against you it will be stopped by SL.  
If price moves 50 points in your favor, SL will be move to Break Even (opening price).  
Then for each additional 50 points in your favor, SL will be moved by 50 points.  
You can use also a Trail Stop shift of 5 points to avoid sending too many OrderModify transactions to the broker (they don't like it).

OK. I will forward test it on [fxcm](/brokers/fxcm "View FXCM Broker Profile") and see.

I haven't tested yet on fxcm, but looking at the code, and in case of multiple orders, and a slow connection/execution, I added a couple of RefreshRates calls in Order Closing and TS.  
  
I am testing this version on fxcm today, default settings +3 orders, Close on Slow MA cross.  
on EUR/USD, USD/JPY, GBP/USD and GBP/JPY.  
M15 time frame.

Example : Entry : Buy EURUSD @ 1.11500 , Stop Loss (100 points) @ 1.11400, Trailing Stop (50 points), Trialing Stop Shift (10 points).  
  
When price reached 1.11550 (50 points in profit), Stop is moved from 1.11400 to 1.11500 (break even)  
Then price goes up to 1.11555 SL will not change as the added 5 points is less than Shift which is 10 points  
Then price goes up to 1.11560 SL is moved to 1.11510, and so on  
So as price climbs SL will be move in steps of 10 points, compared to the standard shift of 1 point.  
This way we are reducing OrderModify requests by 10 times, as we are sending an OrderModify request every additional 10 points in our favor.

Elovv, this is to stop constant modifications being done on the Trailing SL from what I understand.  
Khalil can maybe confirm, but this is how I understand it:  
  
So as the price moves up it would normally change every point, this shift means it needs to shift by the number you enter before it changes.  
So normally if it moved 5 points it would update the SL 5 times, if you have a shift in place of 5 it would only change it once.  
  
**Update: sorry was typing at the same time as you and got side tracked I see you responded to Elovv already.**  
**Can you look at my example below.**

Thanks Khalil, sorry for the delayed replay on this. Really appreciate your assistance.  
I just need some clarity on this, does it need to move the full 50 points in my favor before the SL is moved.  
If I had my shift set to 5 points, I would have thought as soon as I have a gain from the immediate/current price (Not the order price) of 6 points it would then bring the SL up to 50 points below this?  
  
So for example:

I had no SL's or trailing SL's set in these examples above.  
I have now set my SL to 200 and my Trailing SL to 50 with a 5 shift.  
  
So the price fell from 0.9836 to 0.9822 = 14 points.  
Would the Trailing SL not now shift the SL (Set it to 50) 50 pips to 0.9872.  
  
**Update:**  
**I understand what happens if the price goes for you from when you ordered, then the SL is moved as it moves and the shift can reduce the changes.**  
**If the price goes against you and then comes back for you but not into profit would the Trailing SL be applied?**

Trailing Stop get triggered ONLY if price bypasses the Open Price by the Trailing Stop Pips/Points in the trade direction.  
So the Stop will not move while trade is in loss.

Although I set a new policy not to post mql source files for 2016 forward, I will share this one as it is not my system.

Hello Abokwaik,  
I looked at the code, shouldn't be the opposite?  
  
if(sma_exit==EXIT_ON_CROSS)  
{  
if(current_order_type()==OP_BUY && MarketInfo(Symbol(),MODE_BID)<sma) close_current_orders(OP_BUY);  
if(current_order_type()==OP_SELL && MarketInfo(Symbol(),MODE_BID)>sma) close_current_orders(OP_SELL);

Abokwaik,  
Maybe you could add a filter to check if price is too far from long MA we don't enter trade.  
  
Would have avoided a bad trade today short USDCAD....

Should the position have been closed on the 3rd candle after entry?  
  
Is there a bug?

No bugs. The EA is working as per your settings. You chose MA_PRICE_HIGH_LOW not MA_PRICE_CLOSE.

So i think i misunderstood how it works!!  
  
What is the difference between "exit on Fast MA" parameter (which is selected "exit on close") and the "exit mode" parameter",  
  
thanks for your clarification.  
  
And nice work again!!

Just want to make sure to get the same setup as the original version on the new version, had that bug where I noticed two orders which should closed at the same time for a pair and only one closed.  
  
_Original Entry/Exit_  
Entry on Fast MA - True  
Entry on RSI - True  
Exit on fast MA - True  
Rest false  
  
_New version Entry/Exit_  
Entry on Fast MA - True  
Entry on RSI - True  
Exit on Fast MA - Exit_ON_Close  
Exit Modes (Close, High/Low) - MA_Price_Close --> _Dont understand this one as already specified close on the option before?_  
Rest false  
  
Would this be the same settings vs the old system?

Hi abokwaik,  
  
is't possible to make a special MM to this EA? From my BT&forward tests I can see that there is many consequential wins and less consequential losses.  
maybe we can use antimartingale strategy.  
it means: If there is win, increase the lotsize by lot increment number. Do it after every win trade until there   
is a loss. If there is a loss than decrease actual lot size by the lot increment number.  
  
For EA it means:  
  
external values:  
Extra MM: YES/NO  
Lots increment number: 1.1  
  
Thanks for answer..

Hi dafa,Many improvements can be applied to the EA. The thing is that I don't like to clutter this thread with EA modifications.My suggestion is to open a dedicated thread for EA enhancements, back and forward testing. I will do this next week. All credits will be preserved.

Hi Khalil,  
  
When you get a gap can you take a look at this. I am not sure if the TSL is working as it should.  
My SL is 200, and my TSL is 50 and the shift is 5.  
If you look below you will see the TSL definitely worked initially and brought the original SL from 200 to 50 in the green.

But it doesn't look like it has continued to move with the price.  
It should be 55 behind the price, it is currently sitting at 113points behind.  
I think it might apply initially and then not continue to follow as it should.  
Let me know what you think?

If you like I can make it on every tick.

Hi All,  
  
Take a look at Khalil's latest version back tests from August last year to today. This is all with 90% model quality.

Can't go back much further as some of my pairs I can't seem to get decent tick data, USDCHF my tick data won't come right for some reason not sure if someone can back test this period with my settings.  
I am also forward testing as per supa's config below but have added in a SL of 200 and a TSL of 50 with a shift of 5. Took a hit last week on my demo accounts when the SL's were not in place.

Not 100% sure the TSL is working as it should as per above and would be interested to see what difference it makes if it did follow. Could be good or bad... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
The ones at the top are what I am running in my forward testing but I will be droping some out based on my back tests and how they are performing and replacing them with the ones in the red block.  
Attached is a spreadsheet and you can see the charts and reports for each of the back tests.  
  
Take a look at the back tests and let me know what you think.

Hello Abokwaik,  
what do you think about using a max distance between long MA and price to enter a trade?

Ok makes sense now.  
Maybe make a version if you don't mind but we will keep going with original as it is working.  
  
I will back and forward test to see how it effects the results.

Hi Khalil,  
  
I am having some strange differences between platforms.  
  
I have three demo accounts running the same settings on the same pairs.  
[OANDA](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile")  
Roboforex  
Hotforex  
  
The strange thing is that they are all having different results on my forward trading.  
There was some small differences in time of close and open trades which I thought could be latency or something. But now there are multiple trades missed being closed and opened.  
  
Hotforex Current trades open:

Why would they all differ?  
Any idea's?  
  
If you want you can look I have trade explorers running for all three so you can see the three accounts and see the trade history.  
Thanks for all the help as always!

With my current settings:  
_**Entry Rules:**_  
**Long:**  
1\. Price is above 180 MA.  
2\. Price is below 9 MA.  
3\. RSI(2) is below 30.  
  
**Short:**  
1\. Price is below 180 MA.  
2\. Price is above 9 MA.  
3\. RSI(2) is above 70.  
  
I have been looking at the original rules more closely.  
Look at these buy examples:

It doesn't look like the EA is following the RSI rules as per the original rules was this changed somewhere along the way.  
In the above example you can see the RSI is above the RSI low, the MA's match the rules.  
  
Here is a sell example:

Price was below slow MA and above fast MA but was int the middle of the RSI?

Hi, how you able to do the backtest from 2010 onwards? I only able to test since Oct'15 (for H1) using strategy tester with different brokers (e.g. roboforex, ICmarket, [fxcm](/brokers/fxcm "View FXCM Broker Profile") and oanda). thanks.

Hey Spencer,  
  
Your charts show RSI(14), While in the EA settings it could be RSI(2) or RSI(5).  
  
Indicator settings in the EA should match Inidicatr settings on the charts, otherwise you'll get confused. :nerd:

Hi abokwaik, did you open new thread for modifying EAs? I think EA works very good. It's only about deep backtesting to find the best setting for each instrument but there could be some feature modifications to try better performance.. Thanks

Hey Khalil,  
  
Opps.  
lol, sorry about that. Didn't notice the period was wrong, was confused, hehe. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61e.png?v=15.1)  
Looks all good now.  
  
Still something odd though going on though look at this below.  
**_OANDA below, you will see it opened two trades. (This I can see that both RSI's were above 70)_**

It should have close both trades on the last candle but they are still going? (This is an issue)  
Not sure why they didn't close?  
  
_**Then this is Hotforex, you will see with the same settings it only opened one trade, look below. (This is because on Hotforex the one RSI was below 70, differs from OANDA)**_

This was closed correctly.  
  
_**Then this is Roboforex, which looks like is the same as Hotforex. (So the RSI was not above 70 making the second trade not valid)**_

This was also closed correctly.  
  
If you look there are lots of open trades that Roboforex has open that both OANDA and Hotforex hasn't, eish.  
There doesn't seem to be constancy, not sure if it is possibly the computers battling causing it but I doubt it.  
  
Below are is some detail not sure if it will help on the trades not closing.  
Hotforex trades were closed.

Most probably a settings issue.

Will send as soon as back in front of my computer but the settings should all be the same, I copied accross the Profile from one MT4 to the other. I assume the settings in the EA are kept in profile.

Roboforex trades didn't close because you selected EXIT-ON-CLOSE while no bar closed above the fast MA.Other issues will be also relating to EA settings, but I can not check them now as I am away.

SL and TP will be at the cross of fast EMA.  
This is a valid setup as per the default system rules on post # 1.

Hi [ A _bokwaik_](http://www.forexfactory.com/abokwaik),  
  
is't possible to make a rule in EA for minimum distance between trades? I think it could help to better DD. I thing somebody wrote the same request in forum. Sometime EA open trades really very close to each other and this situation increase risk without any help for taking profit.

Hi, you could look at the "journal" in mt4 to find out the order price during that time to better determine the issue.

yes i understood that but it might be dangerous in case of 1 way direction without pullback.  
  
Had you read my post about a filter regarding the distance betwwen 200MA and price? If price is too far from 200 MA, the probability of a pullbacl in direction of the 200MA is high so we don't enter trade in the direction of the 200MA.

I agree. This is why I added 2 additional exit options, SL & Trailing stop, AND, cross of Slow EMA.

Maybe the answer is in the elite trade.  
Thank you.  
It could be a very good system if we could filter these big trending trades....

So in this case, there's no SL nor TP. But is "exit" condition, just close the position whenever price crosses the fast EMA. Isn't it ?

Yes. This is one of the options available in the EA.  
Other options including Hard Stop are also available.  
  
The EA was provided for testing different options.

Namaste! I am looking for a viable EA that is a trend following EA. I've tested this EA with defe's setings on different pairs and it gave me only good results. I will try to put it on a demo on a vps.  
  
All the best!

Hi I used this strategy as a test for my new EA, fxRulesEngine, software (for MT4) as part of final testing for release. The software processes rules and instructions in a text file enabling non-programmers to back test or forward test (and run live) plans like this. My version tested as profitable ($10,000 demo account) on the EURUSD from Jan to Oct 2016 but with only a few signals (results attached). For the record my rules were configured for daily trades:  
Â 

  1. Buy when price above SMA(200); below SMA(5); and below 5 for RSI(2)
  2. Sell when price below SMA(200); above SMA(5); and above 5 for RSI(2)
  3. Close Buy order when price crosses above SMA(5)
  4. Close Sell order when price crosses below SMA(5)
  5. Otherwise rely on stop loss or take profit settings for closing
  6. Calculate stop loss and take profit settings on daily ATR(14)
  7. Calculate lot size on risk management settings (by default 1%)
  8. Trail stops from break-even using ATR(14) calculations

So it looks a profitable, although, conservative trading plan. A trader may be able to safely increase the risk% to 5% with little draw down. Obviously more testing would be needed.  
Â   
Thanks Alex

Is anyone still working on this?  
  
I have been testing the exit strategy for this system and have been getting good results.  
  
I was wondering if anyone was keen to throw some ideas around.

G'day Khalil Abokwaik  
First of all thanking you for such a wonderful work, I have been forward testing TWOMA ONE RSI EA. It is observed that the second simultaneous trade is a loss in most of the time , How can the second order can be restricted? for example a SELL trade, RSI was above 70 line during first SELL trade, then it crosses below 70 line, the first trade closes in profit, after few bars RSI return back and crosses above the 70 line creates another SELL trade and in most cases the trade is big loss. is there any chance, can we restrict second immediate same direction trade if not RSI move to oversold area(crosses below 30 line) and return back?  
  
thanks
