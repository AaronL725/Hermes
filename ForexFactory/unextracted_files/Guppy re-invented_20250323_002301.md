i read your posts   
[https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...2#post14889532](https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/post/14889532#post14889532) and [https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...0#post14891340](https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/post/14891340#post14891340)  
  
this can be done easily. we already have the indicator drawing vlines. but "use Daily or H4 Signal Candle on M30 or M15 Chart for better entry." i use H4 and H1 for short term trades and H1 and m15 for intraday. The charts become slightly messy but properly colour coded are easy to read. will update on this after few days. i suggest you get used to the system first.

the vertical lines are the most important part of the system. they are printed by the Gann indicator. they precisely point to the entry candle. no fun if no vertical lines.   
make sure your chart looks exactly like mine. if not please let me know

"Do we have to exit at the bold rose vertical line?" 3 candles prior to bold rose vertical line . that candle is buullish APB, all rsiomas chhaned to opposite colour and gann vertical line opposite lime signal.  
  
"But this is just a minor pullback, not?" in real time it is not possible to know where the pullback will end and trend will continue .

Then how do you trade with this system in real time (not on history charts)?  
  
Sorry for my English, I mean may be you could be so kind to show some of your trades in several screenshots step-by-step to illustrate the process?

Yes, we sell at white vertical line. star inside arrow is trend envelope 51 alert . at the close of that candle you will get "trend reversal sell" alert. you confirm your entry if subwindow rsioma and gann are magenta and red rsioma is below all magenta rsioma lines.  
in this picture i was illustrating only "PBC BUY" or "PBC SELL" alerts which are generated by trend envelops 3 and 9 .

On our charts, as long as the guppys are magenta/red it is a downtrend. any price action inside guppy lines is a pullback. in live market, as shown in the above pic, whenever the pullback is over and trend continues you will get "PBC SELL" alert {Pull Back Continuation) . that is your entry candle. whenever you get opposite (PBC BUY) alert, you should exit your short position.

There are only 2 types of alerts: PullBackContinuation alert and Trend Reversal alert. when alerted a decision to enter the trade is to be made, rule is actually simple. all indicators should be magenta/red for sell and lime/blue for buy. preferably red rsioma should be below other magenta rsioma lines for going short and vice versa.

red rsioma below other magenta rsioma lines indicates strong downward momentum.

Yes. the gann high low activator is not a oscillator but a chart indicator. if applied on chart with guppy lines, the chart becomes messy. for convinience and easy chart reading i have made it a subwindow indicator.

Sorry, but I'm afraid there is too much fails in the range periods (as with all the MA-crossing systems)  
(or maybe I don't get something core from the filters)

True. So higher timeframes are recommended. I prefer H4 and APB candles only.

The question now is: What time frame is best? Which asset / pairs to trade? How many assets to monitor for potential setup to trade? This would be for day trading London and US sessions.

Absolutely the same at higher timeframes: cross|no cross oscilators while scrolling the screen + wrong crossing predictions of the trend changing:

why do yo want to go long in clear downtrend?  
  
the magenta line and PBC sell sinal after your white line is the sell candle you should trade.

initially there was some problem with the vertical lines drawn on the chart. now that problem is solved, both templets are the same. you can use the first one as its file size is small.

If 1 indicator fails you add 40 more, maybe one of them holds.

While it might seem like overkill, the Guppy MMA trading system actually uses multiple moving averages to capture different time frames and market trends. This approach helps in making more informed decisions rather than relying on a single indicator.   
  
let me identify a few entries for you in live market, try to explain the rules better.

now we wait for gann "trend reversal sell" alert on H1 chart, wait for the candle to close. take a short trade at the close of the candle. stoploss will be swing high on H1 chart and first target R:R 1:1. i trade with 2 lots so if my first target is acheived,i can move to H4 chart for second lot and trailing my stoploss to BE.  
hope you understand.  
  
i am working for next 8 hours so i wont be able to take this trade.  
  
check if our charts look the same and tane a trade in demo account.

H1 never gave a sell signal. thats good as we did not enter a wrong short trade. sometimes no trade is a good trade as you dont loose your capital.  
  
but look at the h4 chart.

the sub window indicators are turning lime. so the down trend in H4 is getting exhausted. that means our setup is invalidated and we will no longer be going short.

understand that over bought and oversold zones are only for RSIOMA (which is an oscillator) and will never repaint. GANN in subwindow is not an oscillator ( i have modified it to print in sub window to prevent cluttering of main chart) and will change its position if you scroll the chart back.  
  
also note that the H1 cahrt had given us a buy signal in the morning according to our trend reversal entry rules mentioned in guidelines document and could have generated good profit also.  
  
the rules are :  
  
1) TREND REVERSAL ENTRY: “Identify trend reversals at the earliest.”  
Specific criteria and rules for this. All criteria need to be fulfilled to enter the trade.  
These are risky trades and should be traded with strict stoploss.  
1) RSIOMA AND GANN BOTH must be in overbought zone (above 80) to go short and oversold zone (below 20) to go long.  
2) GANN trend reversal alert with vertical line on chart.  
3) On the alert candle the RSIOMAS should cross the 80/20 line.  
4) Red RSIOMA should be below Magenta for sell and blue above lime for buy trade.  
5) The RSIOMA and GANN lines should form a picture like open scissors on the entry candle.  
  
let us understand the system first. it will take time . i took more than 5 years to develop it. give me atleast a couple of weeks to explain.

Wait is over.  
1st target acheived.  
SL of second lot shifted to TE 9 price (2nd value in data window).  
Now the trade is in profit and no chance of loss.

Downtrend is intact. (no candle closing above TE 51)  
Probably TE 3 "PBC SELL" alert will be generated by the end of this candle.  
But, subwindow indicators still blue/lime.  
So wait for a candle to closse and Gann "TREND REVERSAL SELL" alert and magenta vertical line printed on chart.  
Go short if above conditions are met.  
Trade in demo account.

A question   
  
the trade explorer on top of this page is showing latest closed profits of 65 and 191 which is right. but the performance today is -$111 and -4.8%.

.  
  
Probably it is due to time zone difference or broker server time difference. Honestly i dont know how to solve this.  
  
otherwise your chart looks good and you can trade as per guidelines.  
One suggestion : chart: properties:colour:line chart , select none so that APB candles will be clearly visible.

An example of:  
Another method of PULLBACK CONTINUATION TRADE ENTRY: “buy on dip” and “sell on rally”.  
Especially when the candles are too large, wait for opposite colour APB candle to form. Then go to lower timeframe and wait for alert in original trend direction.  
  
same setup is developing on USDCHF H4 chart. (the pair i suffered big loss due to false breakout in the last trade ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f614.png?v=15.1))

one way to trade is to place a sell stop order at the low of the pullback candle as i have done. once triggered place SL and TP.  
  
A better method is to go to H1 chart and wait for the Gann " TREND REVERSAL SELL " alert and short at the close of the candle. ( as mentioned in the gguidelines)

This is a very helpful trick that I thought of myself.  
  
When I created my chart, I installed a placeholder in the indicator window 1, in the hope of being able to use there later something better.  
  
I saved my charts as profiles and as templates.  
I also saved your original chart as a profile.

Then I copied the part from your profile file and pasted it into the place of my profile file where the placeholder was.

While you're doing this, some other profile must be active so that the changes can be saved properly.  
  
Please let me know if you have any further questions.

Honestly i did not completly understand the procedure rigght now. But will take a look again in my free time.  
  
looking at your pictures, i noticed MA_Shift = 2 . it should be zero unless you have done it to compliment your charts.

That's right, I wanted the signal line to be a little more visible. I already know that the signal is 2 candles to the left.  
  
Save your chart as a profile, then open the profile file, it is a txt. file.  
There you can find all what is on your chart and you can change everything as you wish. Then save the changes. Finally, open the newly changed profile in Metatrader and everything will be visible just as you changed it. To be on the safe side, you can save the chart as a template to carry out new experiments in the profile file.  
  
Best regards.

USDCHF, GBPUSD and NZDUSD did not go into trend continuation pattern and looks like they are consolidating. so no trades there today.  
  
USD CAD is one to watch for. In an uptrend it has iven a good pullback and looks like may continue the uptrend

My trade was triggered on the next candle . that candle would also have triggered any logical stoplosses.  
"After triggering my stop loss, the price went on to hit all my targets." we all have experienced it so many times.  
after more than $300 loss, finally the trend has continued upwards.

So whenever i get TE 3 "PBC SELL" alert. i will square off the trade irrespective of the profit/loss.

I'm glad I was able to show you something useful. Now you are one of the few traders who know a very useful trick. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f604.png?v=15.1)  
  
During my trading time I got a lot of support from members of this forum. For this reason, I am happy to contribute to the further development of trading activities.  
That's why we're all here, to learn with and from like-minded people, and because it's a lot of fun.  
  
Kind regards. 

Don't trade because you think you have to do something.

One single trade changed all the calculations. My trading explorer, which was red for the day and week, turned green with just one trade. I still have three positions with unrealized green profit.  
My first target in GU was hit, covering my previous trade loss and generating a good profit.

Thank you! Have a great weekend as well! I don't have any plans to visit Dubai soon, but I'm thrilled to hear that you're benefiting from the system. If it helps you earn money, that makes me even happier

Really good thread <3  
Thank you very much for the strategy and open indicator codes. Thanks to this, we can learn even more. I am including an indicator that allows you to limit the vertical lines on the chart. I asked ChatGPT to add a candle limit feature in the indicator (I'm not a coder). From now on you can reduce the number of vertical lines.  
A million green pips to everyone <3

Your trading signals are great, and the best thing about it is that the signals come directly to my mobile phone, so I don't have to sit at the computer all the time and wait for something to happen.  
  
Since I only trade Gold_USD, this is easy to do.  
  
So thank you again for your great work that you share with us.

As for my chart, it is not part of Dr. walvekarrajes trading strategy, which I value very much and which I follow closely.

Seriously, I've never seen a more reliable strategy.  
As I already mentioned, there is no stop loss for me (but it is not a recommendation).  
  
I only make the most reliable trades, and so far they have all been profitable, thanks to your trading strategy.  
  
I wish you and everyone else a nice weekend.  
  
Best regards

Hi Michael, it is fantastic the way you are using the signals. Are you taking trade setups / signals of Gold on M15?

Hello Dr., hope you are enjoying your weekend. Looking forward to your explanation of the importance of RSIOMA.  
  
In the documents you wrote that you don't trade Forex. You trade Nifty and stocks. What do you suggest what we should monitor as a group in this learning period, the number of assets that are offered on MT4?

Hi Hazar.  
Yes, that's how I do it. But I also take other time frames into account, such as M5, M15, H1, H4, to get a better overview.  
However, I just wanted to test these signals in my own way. The result is phenomenal.  
  
Now I would like to learn the Dr. Walvekar strategy with his original chart, because now I am convinced that it has huge potential and will lead to very good results.

Don't trade because you think you have to do something.

Thanks Michael, I appreciate your reply.  
  
I also think that this system has huge potential and thank you for the confirmation. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f64f.png?v=15.1)  
  
Will you be trading Gold with Dr. Walvekar original charts in the same way M5 to H4?

..... yes I will do so. But first I need to know much more about the rules from that system, and need to understand the background. Also waiting the instructions for RISOMA.

Yes. I am more of long term investor. I trade only equities with long term perspective. I have my own way of managing funds which I will explain some time afterwards.  
As my working hours and trading hours in india are same i dont get time for intraday trades. but i love to do that whenever i have time.  
  
On my demo charts i have 8 major currency pairs only. their only purpose is to explain trades in this group. and i am enjoying this because of your whole hearted support and interaction. i thank you for that.

thank you Michael. this is again one of the best compliments.  
  
Actually we are using 4 diffrent systems all of which are trading systems on their own. 1) guppy 2)synergy APB 3) Gann 4) rsioma.  
i have tried to extract the best from all of them to generate high probablity trades. i have taken huge efforts to optimise the settings to pinpoint the exact entry candle and leave no doubts and uncertainty while trading.

i usually use one time frame higher chart to make trading decisions. scrolling through all timeframes is very confusing for me.  
H4 setup and H1 entry is my favourite for swing and H1 and M15 for intraday.  
I think, below M15 is too noisy to take trades. but this is my opinion and i know few traders who make significant profits trading shorter timeframes.

Thank you so much Dr.! Greatly appreciate you sharing your system with us. I know it is not easy developing a system that works and make and then make it in a way that requires less technical knowledge of the market for the end user to be able to trade the system. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f64f.png?v=15.1)  
  
My suggestion would be to work with H4 and H1 entry for the group for the sake of learning at this stage. Later one can venture in to whatever time frame of choosing.  
  
Again this is only my opinion.

Hello Michael!  
Do I understand your process right?  
You get the gann signal on the single tf (M15) and if it in the same direction with the trend on higher TFs (not signals from higher TFs, only direction) you enter the trade. Am I correct?  
Do you use continuation (pullbacks) or reversal way?

Dr. Walvekar,  
With all my respect to your 5 years of work on this system (parallel to your medical practice - it's something unbelievable and supernatural for me itself!), may I please ask:  
How long have you forward tested this strategy when it was complete?

Hi since80808  
Yes, that is correct so far. But of course I also have other guidelines.  
  
I want to explain to you.  
I have been intensively involved in Forex trading for 11 years. Over time I have developed my own trading strategy. I'm very happy with that, I don't need to do much more.   
  
So I was snooping around the forum and noticed the Guppy re-invented thread.   
I combined this strategy with mine to test it quickly, and I can tell you: If you learn it and spend a lot of time with it, you won't need to keep looking for better tools to win money.  
  
I will also learn this strategy in detail.  
My own self-developed strategy is not important here in this thread, please I don't want to talk about it.  
  
We should all learn and understand the “Guppy re-invented strategy” with a lot of effort and respect. That means we are well on our way to confirming ourselves on the Forex market.  
  
You probably know that trading on the stock market is a normal work, that a lot of people do.  
However, you can't get rich with normal work.  
Anyone who believes that will quickly become poor.

Hello Dr. Walvekar  
  
I have a question.  
Which of the indicators is responsible for the blue vertical lines? It's H4 chart of XAUUSD.

Hi Michael, from what I know of the indicators and the system, there are NO Blue Vertical Lines. Only Red and Green vertical lines which is from Gann High-Low Activator that highlights the change in direction. Let's see if Dr. has an answer.

These are also generated by Gann but higher time frame. H1 on M15 and H4 on H1.   
There are 4 M15 candles in H1 chart and 4 H1 candles on H4 chart.  
As Gann 9 is our alert indicator, adding Gann 36 (9*4) will give us H1 alert on M15 and H4 alerts on H1 charts . This gann 36 is printing red and blue vertical lines on the chart. This way we wont have to wait for the higher timeframe candle to close to get alert. H4 and above charts do not require MTF gann as till then the trend is very welll established. Another advantage is to trade in direction of higher timeframe and increase the probablity of profitable trade.  
i will also modify the alerts so that it will be easy to understand.   
  
i will upload the indicators and templete shortly.   
This will be the last modification/upgrade in the system.

Hello Michael!  
I trade over 15 years, nice to meet you ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
I'm at the FF with the same targets as you - just look around and get interesting ideas. Guppies were one of my first POI years ago, so I found Dr.'s thread with my best emotions ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)   
But the worst scenario I saw on FF most of the time was transforming lots of strategies into the "games with MAs", when people believed in MAs (or oscillators) crosses and then killed good practices with own bad trades)))  
That's why I ask so many questions, try to understand the background of every element and forward test this very interesting for me strategy. Not to dig it ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
Thanks for your support ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f1fa-1f1e6.png?v=15.1)

Thank you for the short description of classic Haiken Ashin candles, b.t.w. it's rare that someone write about wicks of HA, not only body ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Hello since80808.  
  
Also nice to meet you.  
I'm all in your opinion. Indicators are only good for the people who sell them, that's just business. One must not forget: First the currency price has to move, if the indicator notices this, it will move too.  
  
We all continue lookimg for new possibilities, it is so anchored in our subconscious.  
  
The Dr. Walvekar strategy is different, here the clever combination of MAs brings success. That's why I like it so much. You can immediately see that this was done intelligently.  
  
You know, I like creating charts, I made a multifunctional chart, all indicators in this chart have an on off button, so that the chart always stays nice and clear. However, I don't use the indicators for trading, they are just decoration for me so that it looks more interesting and that you have something to switch forth and back with.  
  
My normal trading work is finished after a maximum of 30 minutes every day. What's left is boredom, which is why I come up with ideas like creating charts.  
  
Now I'm looking forward to learning this promising strategy in order to further improve my trading.  
  
Kind regards 

Don't trade because you think you have to do something.

1) Average Price Bars: APB candles are a part of synergy pro trading system developed by Dean Malone. here is the ebook published by him.

our defination is different from his. suited for our trading system.  
  
2) Guppy multiple moving averages is a trading system developed by Daryl Guppy. well known as Guppy MMA (multiple moving averages). google it and you will find lots of documentation and videos on that.  
  
3) RSIOMA is RSI of Moving Averages. This is a trading system based on subwindow plot of RSIOMA against a Moving average . the default value of RSIOMA is 21 and MA default value is 14. this system trades on basis of RSIOMA crossing the moving average in over bought or over sold levels. it mainly targets buy entry in over sold and sell entry in over bought zones.  
  
4) Gann hi low activator is a part of many trading systems based on "buy low sell high" and "sell high buy low".

1) we use only APB candles. no other indicators from the system.  
2) Guppy uses Multiple moving averages. we use trend envelops.  
3) we use the RSIOMA and completly ignore the MA part of the indicator.  
4 Gann indicator is only to point out the exact enrty candle and final exit candle.   
  
These modifications, settings, optimisation, alerts is what i have changed to make it a good trading system.  
  
This is working for me with excellent results. so i wanted to share with every body in his forum.

I only trade H4 charts. Sometimes i use H1 as entry chart to trade in direction of H4.  
I havementioned this in Guidelines also.  
Here is an example of how i do it:

The MTF version.  
  
It is not really MTF.  
I have introduced H1 and H4 histogram on M15  
H4 histogram on H1.  
This is for trend direction in higher timeframes.  
These histograms represent Gann 9 activator of the respective timeframes.  
This is mainly for traders who like to look at higher time frame charts for trade entries in lower timeframe. I do not recommend trading below M15 timeframe.  
For H4 and above the trend is already well established and no need to refer to higher timeframes for trend direction.

Thank you.  
So I'm really excited now. I just scored 640 points safely after Asia opened.   
  
I just wanted to examine again how the system works, so I installed 4 TimeFrames on a chart to get a good overview. So that was really great.  
  
Since I am a fan of quick short orders, I naturally wanted to know how far the sell order would go. So I added lines of support and resistance. There was an important support line on the M15 chart, so I was convinced that was where the price would go.  
  
There was the first signal on your chart, which I interpret as a warning like "get ready, stand by". Then shortly afterwards the main signal came, where I had opened the trade. I had set 5 Take Profit points even though I was convinced that the price would safely go to Take Profit 2.  
That was a direct hit, 640 points (I always calculate in points, never in bips).  
So this has happened for the second time in this way, on Friday and just now on Sunday evening. I'll continue this week to explore how far I can push this system. If this brings further success, I will, with your permission, call the system here at my home the Dr Rajesh Grail.   
  
As for every trader, the most important thing is the "in" and the "out". I use the Dr R Grail to get "in" and my own Grail to get "out".  
So that couldn't be topped.   
  
So, I just wanted to share that quickly.  
  
Thank you very much,  
I will keep you all updated on further results.  
  
Best regards

Thank you for sharing your experience in such detail! I'm thrilled to hear about your success and that you're finding the system useful. It sounds like you've really taken the time to understand and implement the strategies effectively.  
  
Your approach of using multiple timeframes for a comprehensive overview, along with incorporating support and resistance lines, is spot on. It's great to see how you're adapting the system to fit your style of trading with quick, short orders.  
  
I'm pleased that the signals are giving you clear entry points and that you've been able to achieve such impressive results. Please continue to share your progress and feel free to reach out. And, of course, its a honour to call it the "Dr Rajesh Grail"!  
Best of luck with your trading this week!

" Plan the Trade and then Trade the Plan"  
I have shared my whole plan with all information and source codes.  
A system easy to follow.  
  
One simple rule. "**_Enter trade when all indicators are of the same color."_**  
Exit as per your trading style and money management.  
A request, at least start trading in demo account, get used to the system and please share your experiences.  
  
Good Luck

Hello Sir,  
In reality, you are building your strategy.  
I downloaded GUPPY-RE-INVENTED.rar from post 1. It still doesn't work properly. Not completely. despite the number of times you redid the file.   
Amateurism, DIY, addition. It's a shame. Be careful not to lose too much credibility !  
Advice: withdraw, build your strategy, check that the indicators and tpl in the file work when downloaded, etc. Test it because you certainly haven't been playing it for 6 months ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)  
And only then post something finished here, a finished strategy.  
Sincerely  
Jean-François

I just wanted to examine again how the system works, so I installed 4 TimeFrames on a chart to get a good overview. So that was really great. Since I am a fan of quick short orders, I naturally wanted to know how far the sell order would go. So I added lines of support and resistance. There was an important support line on the M15 chart, so I was convinced that was where the price would go. There was the first signal on your chart, which I interpret...

Do we buy at the bold blue line (when all the indicators align _after_ the gann vertical)  
or  
do we skip the entry (because not all the indicators align _at the moment_ of gann vertical on the current TF)?

Hello Dr. Rajesh Walvekar,  
I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to you for generously sharing your trading system. Your insights and expertise have provided invaluable guidance, and I am deeply appreciative of your willingness to impart your knowledge. Thank you for your support and for making a significant impact on my trading journey.

Dear Michael, fantastic demonstration of a beautiful setup, entry and exit. Intraday Support / Resistance makes a different in short term trading. Is there any specific reason why you trade Asian Open only if I may ask?  
  
Thanks again and a BIG Thanks for Dr!

You are quite right in placing the stop losse. Look at the first three values in data window. they guide for placing stoplosses and trailing them. initially it is good practice to place stoploss at the 3rd value ( trend envelope 21) and as the trade moves in profit shift to upper values. when you think you are in good profit, trail it to the first value (TE 3) so you dont leave much profit on the table or straight away book profit.  
  
In a healthy trend the high/low of our breakout candle is never breached. most of the times i place my initial SL trher.  
  
There are no blue lines on chart. it was manualy drawn by since80808

Your posts have put life in this thread. the way you express gratude is overwhelming.   
More important is your willingness to change your existing system or rather integrating this new idea into your system is creditable.

Yes, of course.  
I live in Lima, Peru. When the new trading day begins, it is 5:00 p.m. here. When London opens, it's 2:00 a.m. here, when New York opens, I take our children to school, and by the time I have time again, the most important thing with trading is already over. I have found out, that Asia Open is safer for me to trade, there is not so much bluffing. I can tell you, I take a quick look at the chart at this time, set a pending order, that's it. I only trade Gold USD.  
  
At this time in the morning I'm chatting and creating new charts, which I really like. But no trade.  
  
Best regards 

Don't trade because you think you have to do something.

......  
I only use the word points when trading.  
This is easier for me. I also have an Excel program for quick calculations to create a quick pending order, and that is clearer in terms of points.  
  
From now on I´m using only your original chart for my trading. My multifunctions chart is now only used for monitoring and working on the design, which I enjoy a lot.

Doc Rajesh,  
Thank you for this great thread, your humility in sharing such a great tool selflessly by which so many will benefit.  
I have worked through every page to learn and understand your system.  
I have downloaded it and it works perfectly for me.  
Also, thank you to the others who shared their knowledge and added value.

Follow up   
  
entry was perfect, planned.   
price never came anywhere near SL.  
probably any/all targets done.  
most important: the charts had anticipated this move before it happened.

That´s a great trade, and it shows once again how exceptional your system is.  
  
Please allow me to ask: ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
How does this blue line appear in your chart? Why I never get that blue line on your chart?

These are orders in areas where the rsioma line is in the oversold area, so they have hit SL.  
Therefore, I will never enter an order when the rsioma line is in the overbought or oversold zone, that's for sure.

Hello Dr., can you please check the code (whoever has coded for you) of the Gann High-Low Activator indicator, Vertical Lines and the Histogram Indicator. They are running ONE CANDLE BEHIND. You can clearly see in the Daily Chart I am posting and it is the same on all time frames. At least this is what is on my chart when I compare with the Original Indicators. This could potentially give a delayed signal.

....   
Ok I understand. Then you drew this blue line yourself, to mark the entry candle.  
  
I'm just asking because I wanted to be sure that everything is OK with my chart.  
  
Thank you

Your charts do not show the APB candles. you might have disabled them for your convinience . if not click on the APB candle button. you can view normal candle sticvs also by clicking on candelsticks or Alt+2.

Don't trade because you think you have to do something.

Dear Dr. walvekarraje,  
  
Good evening ,   
  
I am new here and impressed by your work, your system and strategy seems to be simple and straight forward. Actually I didn't use it yet either on demo or live. but It is very easy to understand , everything seems to be clear.  
  
Based on my domain and love to expert advisors , do you thing we can find a formula that can get the outpout of each indicator , and make the opening / closing positions 100% automatic ? is there a factor of success ?   
  
again thanks for sharing a nice strategy and excellent template and indicators.

Based on your domain expertise and interest in expert advisors, it is definitely possible to develop a formula that automates the opening and closing of positions based on the output of each indicator. By carefully programming the logic and ensuring that the indicators work harmoniously, you can create a system that trades automatically.  
However, achieving 100% success is challenging, as the markets are influenced by numerous unpredictable factors. While an automated system can improve efficiency and reduce emotional trading, it's essential to continuously monitor and adjust the system to adapt to changing market conditions. Success factors include robust backtesting, regular updates, and risk management strategies.  
I have no experience in expert advisors. Making an expert for this system will require a step by step process starting with entry candle, then stoploss conditions etc etc.

If you can, start creating an expert with entry on the candle where both: TE 51 alert and Gann 9 vertical line alert are there.  
1) both alerts on same candle (this will be the entry candle).  
2) TE 51 alert first followed by Gann 9 alert ( Gann 9 alert candle will be entry candle).  
3) Gann 9 alert followed by TE 51 alert (TE 51 alert candle willbe entry candle).

Entry price should be close price of the candle.  
  
Hope i am clear.

Alternative is to combine 3 indicators to create one alert when all conditions are meat  
  
1) For buy : a) TE 51 buy alert. b) gann 9 buy alert. c) rsioma 12 below 50.  
2) For sell : a) TE 51 sell alert. b) gann 9 sell alert. c) rsioma 12 above 50.  
  
alert with push notification only on the first candle where all criteria are fullfilled.  
  
This way we dont need to monitor all instruments, plan entry to desired price.  
  
Any suggestions are welcome.

This is much more viable option as a **Dashboard** style indicator to start with. This way when the alert is triggered, we can see what other market dynamics are in play, such as Red News, etc., then place the trade or not.  
  
Next phase would be development of the fully automated EA based on the finding and input of the alert indicator / dashboard.

Hi,  
Confusion for me. Do you need all three conditions to return?  
Or a + c  
Or b + c  
are sufficient?  
Cheers

still 8 min to candle close.  
and this is the situation.  
  
1) book profit?   
2) trail SL to BE.  
3) set target to swing low?  
4) stay in trade till opposite alert?  
  
what do you suggest?

Everything nice and cool, my friend.  
However, if there are no rules, the strategy is basically hit-or-miss.  
You have no rules for TP and SL.  
So, this means that sooner or later traders will start losing money, because they don't know where to exit.  
You have defined the entry nicely, but then the rest is gambling.

I dont expect answer   
  
I've made significant profits using this system, as you can see in my trade explorer. The consistent results speak for themselves. I highly encourage everyone to give this method a try. By following the guidelines and being disciplined, you can also experience similar success.

**Further discussing this strategy, by the example of the above Short on EURUSD:**  
  
If we consider that the strategy requires the confluence of minimum 3 elements, I am not sure there was a valid entry:

My magenta line shows where the histograms matched.  
And in that point the oscillator definitely was at Oversold, so no valid Entry.  
  
A better Entry would be on the Break candle, there:

However, at that moment the histograms didn't match, and the oscillator was also near oversold levels.  
  
So, this means that according to the rules of this strategy there was no valid Short Entry?

Ok, cool and nice, and good for you!  
However, you're not telling us a miilion things about what you do and what you don't do when you trade.  
So, your specific case tells us nothing, because we don't actually know if You, yourself are actually following what you write, here?  
It may even be the case that You, yourself don't know.  
It is almost always the case that the trader tells us a strategy which the trader sin't actually following, and their trading is descretionary.

**Yes!**  
However, I would like to concentrate on the strategy, rather than on ping-pong.  
According to H4, we should be in Short:

But also, according to H4 this was a valid Long.  
And the Loss would have been significant.

This means that You aren't telling us everything.  
  
So, is that where You put your Stop Loss?  
Do you use Stop Loss at all?  
When do you decide to exit a losing trade?  
When do you decide to exit a winnig trade?  
Do you add positions to the winning trade in order to maximize RR?  
  
Just a few questions...

I do not think that you can or have the ability to help anybody, here!  
One reason is that you are dodging my questions - not answering them!  
People tend to think that You are some authority because you are MD. DR.  
Well, like you say, your authority is in cancer surgery, not in trading financial instruments.  
Have you considered the possibility that you can be doing more harm than helping?

If you think that I will be using this strategy, you are mistaken...  
As I said above, your strategy is missing all the most important elements  
It's like saying: look guys, here is a powerful land-mine, I know how to disarm it, but you must learn on your own.  
  
Is that how you learned to operate on cancer patients?  
By trial and error?  
Or, just maybe, you have strict procedures which you must follow?

I am sorry, but that means that your strategy is worth nothing and nobody should take it seriously!  
Your strategy here is equivalent to saying:  
I am a cancer surgeon, so you can be one, too.  
Just pick up a scalpel and start cutting people up!  
You need to learn on your own!

It is almost impossible to trade successfully and be profitable by signals generated from an indicator or indicators without knowing some core fundamentals about trading. Without basic knowledge of PA and Market Structure (at the very least). signals are almost useless. Of course this is my opinion.  
  
I am sure Dr. know much more behind the scene than just the signal of the system. Therefore discretion is at play.

You are totally wrong.  
He has zero idea, he is just a Happy Demo Trader who has zero stress and never risked or lost real money in trading.  
And he is trading unrealistic conditions.  
We can get 100:1 on proffessional accounts in Europe, not 2000:1.  
This means that I need to have 20 times, more or less 50K USD to get such ammounts.  
And nobody is giving you a free lunch!  
Plus, trading like this, one more volatile event whipes your account out!  
And no Stop Loss will help, either.  
You can be profitable for a long time, and lose everything in one trade.

Yes 1:2000 leverage is provided by many brokers / in many countries. What's wrong? If 1:2000 leverage illegal in Europe, so what? And you can't say 'Fraud', He clearly said he is trading on demo account, you should apologise.

It is a scam.  
I am not saying that @[walvekarraje](https://www.forexfactory.com/walvekarraje) is a scammer, but that such brokers are scammers.  
You are 99.9% sure to lose your money trading with a broker like that.  
And if you will be making too much money, real money, this broker will make sure that you won't.  
No problem on a demo account!  
After all, they must encourage you to give them your real money!  
  
That's why I claim that @[walvekarraje](https://www.forexfactory.com/walvekarraje) is not aware of what he is doing by suggesting to people that this is some marvelous strategy.

You are not entirely correct. [FXTM](/brokers/fxtm "View FXTM Broker Profile") has won best broker in some jurisdictions for many, many years years. I have used them since 2017 and they offer up to 1:2000 leverage. Funny thing is that their daily trade calls to their client rarely ever fails. Not everybody is after some small retail account. Those who would lose, would lose, even with the best broker.

It's just the truth.  
If it's not true, then there is nothing to get anxious about.  
If it is true, then there is also nothing to get anxious about.  
One should not cringe about the truth.  
  
Being a surgeon requires very high discipline and following strict procedures.  
Trading also requires very high discipline and following strict procedures.  
If someone presents a loose strategy and tells people that it's a highly profitable strategy, but they can't provide any strict procedures, I am sorry, but it is exactly like giving someone a scalpel and telling them to learn to do surgery on their own.

No, not at all.  
If he had pointed out the issue and asked to correct it, I would do it.  
As far as I remember, I was testing my work and it was correct, so I don't really know what the issue is?  
  
Anyways, I am a very experienced trader with a lot of knowledge, that's why I am here to warn all the newbies that this isn't what the Dr claims it to be!  
  
And, what I am writing isn't anything personal.  
I am writing about the strategy and what is missing in it.

Dr Seraj!  
It is obvious this guy didn't read all the rules that you gave us.  
Everyone up till now on this thread was and is in agreement that this system of yours is indeed very good and profitable.  
The point in question that he makes has long since expired **as an uptrend** and is already **in a pullback,** and so far the green and magenta vertical entries are indeed very accurate as entry signals.  
So don't allow some negativity to bring doubt that your system isn't good and allow yourself to be side-tracked by this Mr Know-it-all.  
Rules in a strategy are a matter of choice. We all may get the same rules, but will still choose to trade in our own way; Coders work with structured methods, but traders work with rules subject to their different psychological approaches and interpretations.

...There is no shortage of incomplete strategies on this forum. And those where the exit is not indicated are plentiful.But I recognize that the Dr's answers are vague and that the number of lots played is unthinkable.However, if we remove all the Guppies which are of no use (to air out the graph too much Christmas tree), the entries and re-entries are good.

Dear Dr.  
  
you give excellent system , I will adopt it and take from it what I am satisfied with. Flexibility is a personal thing.  
my first day attempt just buy following the general trend.  
Assuming you didn't define TP or SL , we can choose it ourselves.  
I will take this chance to thank you again.  
  
just to be positive , what I did is , I added the template to the 28 pairs ,, and see that there is too many alerts ( we need to minimize them )  
for example  
when I have the last signal for a pair was SELL , if the next signal is SELL then no need to receive this singal , just the change may be alerted.  
  
In all cases I will follow up and get what suits me , big thank for you Dr.  
  
Regards,   
  
Note : it is imperative that this account is demo as the system is under test

Hi Omar, did you already code an EA with the 3 Conditions outlined by Dr. to have entered that many trades? Or done manually? Last we were discussing to have an Indicator / Dashboard coded to give signal to take a trade or not.

You do realize you are coming across as a hostile participant? You are adding to the list of complaints in a crazed frenzy.  
  
It is also the way one ask questions and giving enough room and time.  
  
An analogy would be, you mentioned you are a very experienced trader, if one started shooting questions; prove that you are experienced, where is your trade explorer, how can we know you are telling the truth etc... curious how you would react.  
  
Take whatever good that you can from the thread, ask in a polite manner.  
  
Take two steps back, stop seeing problems where there are none.

Hi Hashzar,   
  
No brother , programming need some concentration and more free time, what we discuss to be honest is long term plan. as I need to understand at least all the three indicators by opening the source code files and make sure things go smooth.   
  
for sure , If we can get the output from the indicators , dashboarding for at least 28 pair is peace of cake after then.   
  
I have short free times , that's why I make programs very slowly. but if I finish something I will update thru the thread here ,

Brother that is very kind of you and would be a great service to this thread and community. I can tell you guys that Dr's trading idea / system can be used in many different ways and it works! We all need to be a little patient and give it a chance and learn different component of the system. It may not work for everyone as every trader gets attracted to certain style of trading based on their personality.   
  
Thank you Dr!

Hello, do the rules you followed for entries in your trades follow the same conditions mentioned in the method, or do they differ?

I have short free times , that's why I make programs very slowly. but if I finish something I will update thru the thread here , Regards,

Hey buddy, this is not nice at all! BestTraderEv is an amazing contributor to FF community. He is welcome to speak his mind and opinion. He basically had some concerns that needed to be addressed, that's all. Please refrain from rudeness!

Maybe BT EV doesn't like Dr Rajesh´s trading system and can't find the right words to express his enthusiasm.  
His threads are not the most successful in this forum. They were abandoned right from the start as being uninteresting. Take a look. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f971.png?v=15.1)  
  
The doctor has done so much work and his trading idea is a very good one. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1) He also provided a stop loss indicator. One just need to read his instructions carefully.  
  
Please carry on Dr Rajesh. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f64f.png?v=15.1)

Don't trade because you think you have to do something.

Hello everyone , i have been following you guys on this thread for a whole and i'm interested in this system, but i don't see any set of rules or steps to follow, anyone have a list of rules, like when to enter a trade and when to exits a trade.  
  
Thank you guys !!

As far as I remember, I was testing my work and it was correct, so I don't really know what the issue is? **Anyways, I am a very experienced trader with a lot of knowledge** , that's why I am here to warn all the newbies that this isn't what the Dr claims it to be!

First of all, I rarely visit ForexFactory these days, as I never tried to a friend of mine told me to have a look and I came to visit.   
@BestTraderEv, if you are a very experienced trader with a lot of knowledge then you should know that strategy itself can't make a good/bad trader. Let's assume you are a good trader, then in the provided document your eye should catch the **writings about the StopLoss/TakeProfit area, and even getting out of the trade.** It's written in a manner that traders with good experience can catch and noobs will miss. Anyway I think you were disrespectful with few of your words.   
  
Lastly don't feel very proud because you have knowledge and experience or you have become a high impact member here, if you can't even read a given document as professional trader then consider yourself as a beginner. You pointed about the trading conditions in Europe/brokers : You may have a lot of knowledge but let me give you some more, **trading conditions of brokers are related to Risk Management** , **not part of a Strategy.** Strategy and Risk management are two different aspects of a trader. 

Trying to become a Better Trader.

Dear ozkamin   
  
Just to explain : I am following the general trend based on the suggested indicators by the Doctor. No I am not following specific rules. I said it is flexibility to read the indicators my way.

Just do you and don't let anyone who always want attention distract you. You have given what you know and you are not meant to spoonfeed anyone. You have given much details about your strategy and the people who it alligns with will benefit from it, you are not meant to help everybody. Thanks for your contribution and i can say the system has helped improve my own trading .

Tapi,  
Because that Mr Know-it-all of a Coder came along and spoilt it for everyone on this thread; so I suppose the good Doctor removed his stuff.  
  
Please continue Doc...you have much more support here than him.

Hi brother, I agree with you and I can confirm that it has definitely improved my trading as well, and I took from it whatever I needed and I don't need anymore. Too bad this had to happen. Ultimately it is Dr's decision, but for whatever it's worth, we kindly ask you (Dr) to continue with this threat as it will help those that need a workable trading system. Some students need more time to grasp things. Wishing you all the best!  
  
I am grateful ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f64f.png?v=15.1)

Ah, the irony. Bestevetrade puts me on ignore for giving out some feedback.  
  
The same guy expected Mr. Rajesh to bend over backwards over him and even went till the extent of calling him a scammer. 1% of the same treatment given to Bestevetrade, he shrivels, gets offended.

Why? Because you don't have a gazzilion of lines and colors?  
This is showing exactly the same thing.  
With only two of the indicators from the strategy.

What do you want to know?  
I just noned all the arrows, changed colors, and shifted the MA's 3.  
And made the REVERSAL MA thicker.  

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

[![Click to Enlarge

So, what you have here, is the REVERSAL MA, which you should trade the Break Candle, and the theoretical SL MA.  
All very simple.  
  
The thick MA is the REVERSAL MA.  
Red at the support as the Break for Short.  
Green at the Resistance as the Break for Long.  
  
Like at the top of the image, where we see a lot of false Breaks.  
  
No need for any other stuff which actually does nothing for what will happen after we take a position.  
  
When the trend is strong, the thick MA plays it's role.  
However, we see all this in the past.  
We never know if there will be a strong trend, or if the price will go sideways.  
And we tend to lose the most when the price refuses to trend.  
  
And that's why we need something to prevent us from overtrading at sideways market.  
For this strategy, of course.  
  
Like at the top of the image, where we see a lot of false Breaks.

I don't drink such stuff.  
Sorry, you just made an enemy!  
  
And as for "pray for me" - you can GFY!!!  
That's why you believe in these theories, because you believe in fairy tales and magical spells!  
  
Use your prayer (magical spell) in hospitals and see if that helps anybody!

Actually, the image the Dr presented looks like we used to paint our first picture of a tree in kindergarten.  
A huge blob of paint on the paper which doesn't resemble anything real.  
It resembles something I was doing maybe ten years ago.  
My chart was so full of lines and zones, and what not, that the real candles become invisible.  
And in this Guppy thing, the candles aren't even real!  
You show me one proffessional trader who trades such stuff!  
  
What do you think that all those lines, colors, and stuff actually add to your trading results?  
  
**And those are the actual lines from the strategy, not something I plotted!**  
So, what are you talking about?  
See for yourself. Get rid of all the other indicators and just leave those two.

clearly the comments from those on this thread speak volumes about DR approach and his charting style compared to yours that only one of your side kicks supports on.  
most people right about now from the shame would know to bow out, but you are just a shameless wannabe.  
  
good luck and again may i suggest you have a few beers tonight it is friday and let your hair down bruv

Dear Doctor!  
The fact that I am commenting on your thread means that I care!  
I am not doing a compaign against You personally.  
I have no influence on the fact that stupid people don't understand anything and just react like moths to light!  
I do support You and I just want to make your strategy better.  
  
I have seen this many times!  
They react like a magpie to glittering things, they love You, and after a while, when they start losing, they hate You.  
  
And, as the above posts clearly show, they don't even know what they are using.  
I literally used two indicators from the strategy in the orignal template MA settings (just shifted 3), and they say that I plotted something like a 5-year-old.  
When I plotted nothing else than what's in your templates.  
  
So, what can we expect from such people?

What kind of psychological problem do you have? You attack the OP in a very rude way, accuse him of providing a scam to the FF community. And now you switch to " Dear Dr." and ask him to align with you against the "stupid" followers of this thread? A typical "if you can't beat him, join him pattern". Stick to your coding activities - although they are limited as the OP outlined with regards to the wrongly programmed Gann High Low Lines indicator provided by you. Please leave this thread and stop boring the community with your rude and useless comments/system optimisation proposals. Thanks!

Hi friends.  
I have a hard time understanding how one can argue with other people about indicators and trading systems.  
  
Everyone who creates a trading system has their ideas about what they want to achieve with it.  
  
There are so many different indicators. What do they do? This is very easy to see. They chase the price because they need a guide, without the price the indicator doesn't know where to go.  
  
For the price it´s not important, if a few MAs cross each other, or whether a line from the Stochastic crosses any level.  
  
Anyone who has worked in Forex trading for a longer time has probably heard about support and resistance lines. These lines are created by the behavior of the traders. These lines are the magnets that keep attracting the price. Actually, you don't need any other indicators because the price finds its way to these lines, or rather levels, all by itself.  
  
If you don't believe that, you can install a tool like this on the chart and watch how the price goes to these levels in all time frames.

I haven't been able to figure out why that is, but I have an idea. It would be possible that these levels are take profit levels from the Big Player, and that is why the prices are consistently guided towards these lines.  
  
Why does the price turn around when it reaches such a level? As some big players have reached their take profit and are cashing in, this leads to a price reversal.  
  
If you look at the charts carefully, you can easily guess where Forex traders will move the price.  
  
I also have a few small arrows on my charts, but I don't necessarily need them, they're there because it looks nice and has a small psychological effect. So, as I said, these levels don't come about because a few indicators cross each other, but they are there and came about because money was invested there with the aim of getting to another resistance or support level.  
  
I make my trades very carefully, and when I make one, then I get a hit.  
  
This is where the Guppy trading system comes into play. This can make trading decisions much easier and I'm glad that it exists, thank you Doc.  
  
If you would like to have some take profit levels, simply add a slightly modified Fibonacci (member Gleam showed me that) and you will definitely not be disappointed.  
  
Every trader can try that. It helps with earning money. So, there is no reason for unnecessary arguments.  
  
I'm not introducing a new trading idea. I'm just showing that it's not worth making such a big fuss about a lovingly developed trading strategy.  
  
  
Best regards to everybody. 

Don't trade because you think you have to do something.

Respected BestTraderEv,  
I will try to answer your questions to the best of my knowledge.  
To start with in my original first post, all the documents were under the heading of Guidelines. I never said rules of trading... Rules are strict, Guidelines are “something that can be used to help you make a decision or form an opinion.”.  
You said “However, if there are no rules, the strategy is basically hit-or-miss.  
You have no rules for TP and SL.”  
The 5th sentence in my first document is “Trend envelops from 3 to 51. Special attention is to 3,9,21and 51.red blue lines with circle dot or star. (the values are seen in data window in the same order).   
3 and 9 are to identify pullback continuation pattern  
_21 is for stoploss_  
51 is for reversals.  
  
“You have defined the entry nicely, but then the rest is gambling.”  
Well, trading is not gambling. It is taking calculated risks.  
Page 10) or the end of the document:  
So, the trade should be squared off at  
A) trend envelope “PBC SELL” alert  
B) trail SL at trend envelope 21. (third value in data window)  
C) APB bearish candle/Gann “trend reversed sell” alert.  
  
  
I square off irrespective of profit/loss if  
1) Opposite colour bullish or bearish APB candle.  
2) All rsioma change to opposite colour.  
The answers to your questions are already documented.  
  
You said “However, you're not telling us a miilion things about what you do and what you don't do when you trade.  
So, your specific case tells us nothing, because we don't actually know if You, yourself are actually following what you write, here?  
It may even be the case that You, yourself don't know.  
It is almost always the case that the trader tells us a strategy which the trader isn’t actually following, and their trading is discretionary.” “Your strategy is missing all the most important elements”  
  
In the documents about RSIOMA and APB candles, I have clearly written with pictures illustrating how to interpret them on our charts. (Which is nothing close to the way they are traditionally used.)  
None of the indicators I have used the default settings, but I have optimized them to synchronize with our charts and define clear entry candle.  
  
You said  
“**What kind of leverage do you need to have in order to enter 4 lots with 2456.86 USD and still have 1612.52% Margin Level???**  
**Where do you get such trading conditions???”**  
  
Here you are right. I have no experience in in trading forex market. I trade in Indian markets. We don’t have mini or micro lots. In the document. “My method of trading: I enter with 2 lots. My initial stoploss is previous swing high/low. As the trade progresses, I shift SL to trend envelope 21 (third value in data window). I square off one lot with R:R 1:1 . second lot I carry till I get a opposite signal.”  
Same principle I used in trading demo account. I had no idea that this will amount to trading unrealistic conditions or huge fraud or scam. Here please ignore my ignorance.  
  
Finally, I am addressing you Respected because I mean it. I have been reading your posts in the other thread without missing a single one. Your skills as a coder are exceptional and you use them to help others is very creditable. Your work on “RSIOMA_v4.0_alerts_collab” was at my request and I cant imagine the amount of hard work and the number of hours you put into it. Unfortunately, it did not work with my charts as expected, still I am grateful for that.  
I have already said this twice and I will say it again.  
Happy to see you here.

one last comment.   
you being a expert and a coder, you can easily read between the lines. For most of us we need spoonfeeding with lines and arrows. so why not make the chart colourful and delightful to look at? this is definately not a crime.

Michael.MSA,  
I like your approach and strategy, it is very enlightening.  
Although you mentioned before that we should not ask you for your strategy I do want to ask if you are using a particular S/R indicator that you would like to share.  
I tested the good Doctor's system on a live account as you will see the results below.

Ryder!  
I trade on the 4H and regularly look down to the H1 to see what's going on.  
For pullbacks I go down to the 15M as confirmation that the colors are aligned the same in the opposite direction if I want to trade the counter trend/pullback and if not then I wait for the main trend colors to come in alignment on the 15m with the 4H to continue then join the continuation again on the 4H.

Hi Ryder.  
I didn't make any of these trades. I only used these two images to show how important resistance and support lines are.  
I like trading on the M15 timeframe.   
  
The 1st picture is H1, the 2nd H4, so that you can see the resistance and support better.  
  
Since Dr. Rajesh published his system, I use his signals for entry, and the support and resistance levels in combination with the modified Fibonacci for take profit.  
Maybe this information will help you.  
  
Kind regards 

Don't trade because you think you have to do something.

Hi Worsman.

Feel free to set the settings like you want.   
I didn't develop that tool, I just animated the button a bit.  
  
When you find here in the settings at this place a number 3, I recoment to change it to 0.

About yout trading results:  
That's not bad, apart from the two open orders.  
I find it a bit difficult to make both open orders, buy and sell positions, profitable because with 10 cents, then with gold USD, and such a bit money in the account. That can quickly become a nightmare.  
  
In addition, the buy order also brings daily negative swap costs.  
  
If you try to have the support and resistance lines in the background on the chart to orient yourself, I am convinced that you will have even better performance.  
I think this should be the basis of every chart, but it's a matter of opinion.  
  
I really like Dr Rajesh's trading system, I've written about it a few times. What I like best are the entry signals.  
I deleted all the other things, now there are only 2 trading systems that I work with, that's his and mine.  
  
Ok, I don't want to bore you with so many things. You know now, what you could do.  
  
Kind regards

Identifying false breakout (also read the document on the same).  
  
This is H4 chart of GBPUSD.  
As described in the document and the pic, we identify the false breakout on H4 chart.

To get a earlier entry, go to H1. The candle which satisfies all our criteria is our entry candle.

Hi Michael, please feel free to express your ideas and concepts. SL and Targets is a grey area for everyone.  
Also please feel free to share the support resistance indicator (if you want) as many members are requesting for it.

Hi,  
I don't speak English, I use a translator. And I have a little over 15 years of experience in Forex. I am a very very old man.  
  
I simplified a lot. Only kept what is useful to the strategy. Kept only for example, the Ma 3; 6; 9; 51 for visual signals, SL evolution and trend. And we could still simplify that too.  
The graph is more airy, more readable, more visual. Less “Christmas tree” overloaded.  
Rajesh Reversal is in fact an old indicator (reviewed, redone by "jeanlouie", then by the Dr who renamed it) and I am surprised that in all this time no one has noticed the excellence of the signals... excellence if it doesn't repaint? As well as Rajesh GLH Histo (old indy renamed)?  
I also fired APB because I like to see what the prices are really doing. Which does not modify the signals at all.  
Added the very important "Support and Resistance" (with a button on the side).  
There you go, I'm not quite finished and of course I won't post here so as not to bother this thread  
This is just to show you what can be done simply and effectively with the same indicators.  
  
Santé

Hello le celte, thanks for posting. I like your chart and your understanding. Yes when the indicators are understood and what they do (break of EMA chanel) then you can modify your chart to suit one's style. Mine is something similar to Michael's where I have converted Doctor's signal in to wiggly and arrows. And support / resistance indicator on my chart. Trade in the direction of the trend (sub-windows) when signal is given.   
  
But it is best to stick to Doctor's original template for those that are new.

Sir,  
1) It is also possible to remove all lines and arrows and keep only the alerts working. This way it will be like trading naked charts.  
Also it is possible to use only alerts in your own charts as Michael is doing successfully. As i have already said if you can read between the lines, you need only alerts. I have made charts user friendly so that just by looking at the last candle, a trading decision can be made. No analysis required.  
  
2) I assure you sir, none of the indicators repaint.  
I have modified the indicators, especially the alerts to make it easy to identify which indicator has produced alert, at what time frame and what is the significance of that alert.( even the alert is seen on mobile phone). I have renamed the indicators for convinience and do not take any credit for them.  
  
3) Every line on the chart has its own significance while making trading decisions. To understand this please translate and read the documentation in the first post. Then you will understand why the chart needs to remain the same.  
  
Happy Trading

Look at the H4 and H1 images and see how precise the entry can be on H1 chart.

Everyone is making an effort to simplify and make the charts more readable. ( I fail to understand why?) Everyone is free to use the indicators and alerts and add them to their own trading systems and trading styles. However, to maintain consistency and ensure everyone can follow along easily, I kindly request that we stick to the original template and settings. This way, we can all discuss and learn from the same setup, ensuring clarity and uniformity in our analysis. I hope you understand and continue to find value in the system as it is.

The charts and all indicators together form a comprehensive trading system that is both easy to analyze and visually appealing. Apart from good entry signals there is much more to learn and understand. Entry if you have missed the initial entry, re-entry, adding to positions, extracting maximum profit in a healthy trend etc etc. Finding support and resistance is good but we have see these levels broken all the time in a stong trend. we have seen so many times that after your tatgets are reached, the trend contiues much further, otherwise how new highs and lows will be formed?  
A request again to stick to the templete.

I completely agree with you Dr.! We all can easily post modified charts as we have done already. But that will diminish the actual learning and exploring of the system as is on which you have spent a lot of time fine tuning. It has only been a little over a week and we are busy doing our best to change the original system.   
  
Now if anyone can create a Scanner Alert for Multiple Pairs to be monitored and alert us to a potential trade, that would be amazing! Any coders want to take this challenge?

I agree with you Doc. and also with you Hashzar that we should not deviate from the purpose of the whole thread by watering it down with charts other than

IF you do make changes for your own purposes then it's good if you keep it to yourself besides explaining here on the thread what changes you have made and how it affects or enhances the outcomes of the original system.  
This is a fantastic system that (I believe) can benefit us all if we brainstorm our experiences and also to share pitfalls and difficulties we encounter on the way forward.  
I trust that my observations will not annoy anyone here.  
Maybe if someone could share how to create a window within a window to monitor a smaller timeframe like the 15M (small window) on a 4H to be able to see a pullback while trading the 4H.

How to identify false breakout here, at the last right gann green vertical line? (I mean if it was the real time trading, not post chart analysis)

Excuse me may I kindly ask  
why don't we enter absolutely the same situation earlier, at the yellow vertical zone (with the result you can see)?

How do you explain why markets should follow your pattern, where predicting power comes from. If it's too complicated, not many traders can rediscover and follow it, creating self-reinforcing loop that explains predictability. That's why I'm not a fan of complex patterns - too unlikely sufficiently many traders recognise and follow it.

Hi PMT, H4 is clearly in a Downtrend. Best is to wait for a pullback and re-enter short in the direction of H4 trend if the setup presents itself. Going long here would be too risky in my opinion.  
  
Also, wait for H4 candle to close before making an entry decision. Because price can drop before candle close and signal is not valid anymore.

For a "False breakdown" least one candle should close below the TE 51 line and print arrow ( star in circle).  
in your image there is no "False Breakdown" as the uptrend is intact. The entry at the close of your last candle and there are no red/magenta lines above the candle then this is justified as a continuation trade.  
  
" False breakout" is in Down trend and "False breakdown" is in Up trend.

Doc!  
IF members read and re-read your notes and the guides that you supplied then there will be a better understanding of this great system.  
If you read and don't understand then come here and ask the points that are unclear...like the answer that Hashzar explained in this last post; it is precise and very clear.  
What we must understand about this system is that it is not a scalping system where you will scalp on the 15M or 5M...It is a system that you trade on the 4H like the good Doctor said and then check your pullbacks on either the 15M or 1H.  
We are here to help each other to make some good pips and make money friends, let's help each other.

In H4 on candle (1,2) a reversal trade is valid as per our rules. Page 8 of 'GUPPY RE-INVENTED" document. in this document i have missed a very important criteria in "1) TREND REVERSAL ENTRY: “Identify trend reversals at the earliest.”  
The criteria is " Ignore the Guppy if ALL other criteria are fullfilled".  
  
I dont know if the H1 was at the same time as H4 chart. still your long entry is valid but not on candle 4 but candle 3.

M15 trades are scalping trades. Here it is Quick In,Quick Out. R:R 1:1,1:1.5, 1:2 is the max you should target at.  
Other way to trade M15 chart is with 2 lots, book one lot at R:R 1:1. Get tour SL at BE immediately. then eirher book profit at 1:2 or trail SL according to your trading style.

one more observation: Your chart is not a full page chart but  
same chart posted by Hashzar [https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...6#post14909996](https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/post/14909996#post14909996) is a full page chart. And his analysis is perfect.  
in his chart, there is no "scissor" formation in subwindow. Then as i said earlier, trend reversal entry is NOT justified.  
  
For all: To have a honest opinion or analysis describe in full charts. This way we will be on the same page.

Sir, The trading system I've shared is designed to be straightforward and intuitive, making it easier for traders to understand and follow. The predictive power comes from the consistent application of well-established indicators and patterns that reflect market behavior. While the system might seem complex initially, it is actually based on fundamental market principles that many traders already use. By learning and applying these principles, we can create a self-reinforcing loop that enhances predictability. I appreciate your perspective and encourage you to explore the system further to see how it can work for you.

Absolutely right. One step further.... Trade in demo account till you get hang of the system.  
  
"What we must understand about this system is that it is not a scalping system where you will scalp on the 15M or 5M."  
  
This can be very well used for scalping also. But the criteria, guidelines for that are different.   
As the thread progresses i will try to explain that also in short documents.

Going long here would be too risky in my opinion. Also, wait for H4 candle to close before making an entry decision. Because price can drop before candle close and signal is not valid anymore. {image}

Dear friend, all the screenshots i have posted in this thread are live trades on demo account. I follow the same principles in my live account. I trade indian markets in NSE. If you want I will post screenshots of that also. But that will be boring for you all.

Hope & Glory,  
I shall use an example of a 4H Gold trade that I am currently in; The trend on Gold is Bearish right now, so when you see a color change in the candles moving slightly sideways or in opposite direction **it is good to go check the lower timeframes eg 1H,30M,15M to see if a pullback has started,** unless you receive an alert thereon.  
I normally bank if in profit or close down if the loss is affordable, but one can also hedge your trade and trade the counter-trend buy to add some profit from the counter-trend/pullback and then close off the trade if the price turns in the direction of the 4H major trend.

Markets don't need to "follow" any pattern – the system is based on principles that have consistently worked for those who take the time to understand and apply them.  
For eg. Dogi, Hammer, Head and Shoulders, etc etc etc. Do you think that these accepted patterns work 100% of times? Still trades are taken on these patterns.  
Sometimes they work, sometimes they dont.  
what we are trying to do is to find high probablity, low risk high reward entries.  
And this system is working for me.

Doc!   
I may have named it pullbacks by error, sorry, it should be continuation patterns joining up later with the main trend direction.

Doc,  
The first one is a definite continuation buy trade to join up with the main 4H bullish direction.  
The second is a no-go as there is consolidation, mixed candles and no alerts to take a trade.

Every alert is not a tradable alert. All indicators should agree. This is how high probablity entry is possible.   
this is the reason its very difficult to compile an expert. too many parameters to consider.  
this is a manual trading system .  
There is one secret indicator, which is free and everybody has it. only it is neglected.

You call it trend continuation? No problem (even not looking at the break of the structure and not a trend for that moment, ok). But price went down (with all the indicators tandem lime). It's absolutely the same price-MAs-crossing games with oversold\overbought oscillators that just confirm each other at every momentum\stop hunting\range. In any trend you don't need indies, and no indies will show you the end of the trend.

It's not about quicknes. Do we use SL? Yes. Will the trade be stopped using MAs (with any names) in range? Absolutely - look at any one of my screens in this thread.

So (as BestTrader Ev wrote) - we only have an idea of entries (based on MAs = nothing in a range or at the momentum) and not a strategy with the somehow calculated or market structure based targets.

I will not buy USDCHF because the candle has not closed through the small flag.

the only reason not to take a buy trade is "RSIOMA Overbought" zone . as answered correctly by [hashzar](https://www.forexfactory.com/hashzar). Very likely that in overbought zone it will have a pullback which will take out your SL. risk is too high to take the buy trade. this is the significance of RSIOMA on our charts.

12 hrs in trade. All indicators blue/lime. Upward bias continued.  
The blue rsioma has crossed lime, so upward momentum expected.

Good morning Doctor. I am following the same trade on demo and all is good. As you can see my chart, because broker difference in data, etc., Gann 9 signal kicked off much later for me. But still entry is valid.

Hi, for those who scalp with this system, attached is an indicator with the ability to set the number of candles on the chart (this has already been done), and with the ability to set the number of vertical lines visible on the chart.

Can you modify the indicator to draw Horizontal Line at the High and Low of the reversal candle? Lines to be Red on down reversal and Green on up reversal.

Conversations with ChatemGPT can be difficult and long, despite the simplest requirements for modifying the indicator. I will check to what extent I can come to an agreement with ChatemGPT regarding horizontal lines. For a seasoned coder, it's probably a few lines of code. I'm green in coding. Only what I order for ChatGPT. When the effect is positive, I will come back here with an indicator![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f4b0.png?v=15.1). If the effect is negative, I will remain silent![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60e.png?v=15.1)

Sir, our templete is just 27kb as i have removed all objects before saving the templete. If you are worried about slowing down of MT4 that is already taken care of. It dosent matter how many vertical lines are there on the chart, MT4 will run smoothly.

If the H1 histogram turns bearish, it will be a dream trade. Catching trend reversal of higher timeframe in lower time frame is really a dream.

You were correct but the main reason was RSIOMA were in overbought zone.

Hi, 1 or 100 lines will not burden MT4. I wanted to see one last line. That's all ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) It's possible that someone will also find it useful to see as many lines as they want on their chart.

Hi,  
  
Is it possible that you did not go through the initial guideline provided?  
There he explained his exit strategy: TP1 on 1:1 RR, then move remaining position to break even and trail with TE 21.  
  
keep in mind there will be losing trades in every strategy or system.  
To minimise risks and losses, he advises not to take a trade if the entry candle is too large and requres a huge SL.  
  
I do not know either of you, and have only tried to perhaps provide some insights that you may have missed.  
Cheers!

You are right. Only that the rsioma on H1 was near 50 and red below magenta, i thought there was some room for the trade to work out. My SL was hit.

The breakdown candle is huge. no one will trade on that candle.The following 3 APB candles were bearish but none went below the break down candle.  
The following 4 APB candles were lime body but no lime wick. These are consolidation candles as per our guidelines. The next APB candle is magenta body and wick ( bearish as per our guidelines) . also the RSIOMA which had turned blue, turned red again.( Red RSIOMA below magenta). that was your entry candle to enter short with SL at the consolidation swing high. Rest, number of lots, lot size, targets, money management as per your rules. This was a definate profitable trade .

H4.  
H4 because the trend is already established. There is less noise in price action. also you get adequate time to plan entry and money management.

Please do test in demo account first. Get used to the system. Understand all the indicators and their role. though it might seem complicated at first, its a visual system. just by looking at the colour of all indicators, the entry will be clear.   
Honestly i dont trade forex. i am a swing / positional investor in indian market and equity.  
BestTraderEv has already pointed out that the margin i am enjoying in demo account is unreasonable.  
someone has already said that trading in demo accout is not the same as trading in real account.  
I agree with both of them.  
I know the system works for me. Hope it will work for you too.

PULLBACK CONTINUATION TRADE ENTRY: “buy on dip” and “sell on rally”.  
This is a good example how to define “sell on rally”. To identify where the rally has ended and the down trend i intact, that also on a specific candle. No exra analysis required. also SL is defined. what remains is money management, targets and trailing SL when in profit.

I'm delighted to hear about your success with the system. While I generally recommend sticking to the original setup, I'm always interested in learning about new insights and discoveries. Feel free to share your modifications and findings here.  

Meanwhile, you can describe your setup and trades in detail for us to understand better.  
Looking forward to hearing more about your experiences and continued success!

This is a combination of 4 trend trading systems optimised to work as one.  
There are setups within setups in the whole system.  
Adding and removing stuff might help your own trading strategy but might not be useful for others.  
Let me give you an example.  
Only using guppy trend envelops, there is a very profitable setup which i do like to trade. It is trading the first pullback.

This occurs very frequently in all timeframes and is a valid trade .  
  
So a humble request again.   
Without changing the templete, any and all suggestions are welcome.

Hi tolani, the reason you are not able to upload is because you just recently joint forex factor and that makes you a junior member. Perhaps you can send it directly to one of us and we can upload it for you. If ok with doctor.

Hi ozkanim  
It might help if you know where are the resistance and support levels in the M15, H1 and H4 chart. Then you know where it can become dangerous, or you can decide whether it would be better to close the trade.

Here you can see that the entry point was very good. M15 and H1 are zoomed in a lot, for a better overview. The vertical yellow lines show the entry in the 3 time frames. I sometimes use this chart as a scanner. The yellow circles at the bottom provide even more security for a successful trade. Top set up.  
  
Kind regards 

Don't trade because you think you have to do something.

hello @walvekarraje so in this case how would you have manged this trade had you gone in on the second green candle in H4 as false breakout is forming later ?

Wait for candle to close. This is a mistake I do when i am working and expecting the market to move in my anticipated direction.  
[https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...4#post14923864](https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/post/14923864#post14923864)  
This is the same mistake I did twice in my last USDCAD trade. My sell entries were triggered on open candle and then the price reversed.  
Obviously my SL were hit.

I consider the Guppies while entering a trade. They represent dynamic area of support and resistance.

Notice my entry candle of GBPUSD. A single candle broke all the resistances upto TE 51 in a downtrend. Obvious trend reversal.  
  
While trading H4, For entry I will consider support resistance on H4 and above. Those on M15 and H1 are significant for target levels I suppose.

> 
> Ignored

A long entry on the open of second green candle was a valid reversal entry as per our guidelines.  
My initial SL is always the swing high/low in trend reversal entries and first target R:R 1:1 ( I trade 2 lots). As the trade progresses i trail Sl to TE values in the data window. In this case I would trail SL on TE 9 which i usually follow (second value in data window). TE 3 is too close at the beginning of the trade but when in significant profit I trail it to TE 3 (first value in data window.  
As the trase progresses and as long as the APB candle color is in your favour, it is a good practice to keep SL deep so you dont get taken out by the volatility.  
  
Hope ths helps.

I have to get used to see the guppies as support and resistance. I can always learn something new in this way.  
I think that's good.

A classic example is in the same post.  
[https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...5#post14921425](https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/post/14921425#post14921425)  
Look at the EURUSD chart.  
After Uptrend is established ( all guppies green) The first pullback early in the trend is inside the guppies which act as dynamic support and continuation pattern confirmed by TE 3 buy alert. If you miss it then the Gann alert on the next candle. Also notice the flag made by the red guppies which is broken (dynamic resistance).  
Such entries are very common and extremly profitable.

Just by looking at the charts you will realise the beauty and ease of trading.  
I have put in lot of efforts to optimise the settings.  
Read my posts above with lot of explaination of how to use and utilise them for entries.  
[Michael.MSA](https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/post/14924978#post14924978) has integrated this into his own trading system very successfully.  
  
There is always a learning curve. Take your time. Get used to the cahrts and alerts in live market. You will definately benifit.

Today my Gold trades hit stop loss. It was a good setup on H1 continuation trade. But with Powell talking today the spike in Price Action hit stop loss. There is always next trade.  
  
Dear Tolani, I agree with Doctor. Please share with us your findings and adjustment to the system. Your trades are very good and certainly we are interested to see how you are achieving such a wonderful result. Thanks.

Good day Doctor, I do not totally comprehend your position on this issue , at one point you said you are interested to know about any additions I have made to the system, on the other hand you said one request, Don't delete anything on the chart. If you remembered in my previous post I specifically stated that I remove some stuffs and some stuffs were added, if you are now giving me a double positions, it's very unclear to me. Anyways like you said in one of your post what works for me may not work for other traders . It depends on how we see the market at a point in time. I plea we stick to the original template to avoid trigger of any controversies just like the last time. Meanwhile I will continue to try to reach you privately maybe ff will allows it

Can you post your charts please. It is hard to make out when and how you took the trades. Showing profits are encouraging, but no one can learn from that. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f64f.png?v=15.1)

I have posted all documents and charts with detailed explanations of when and how I take my trades, including the specific indicators and strategies I use.  
I dont mean to be rude but if you can't understand when and how I took the trades, maybe this system isn't for you. Showing profits is proof that it works; it's not my job to hold your hand through every step. Figure it out yourself if you really want to learn.  
  
this is a chart right now, for a long trade.

If my trade is triggered all parameters are set. Either my SL will be hit or one target will be acheived.

Hi Doctor, that message was not meant for you asking to post the charts. It was for tolani. He somehow manages to upload images of profits, but not able to upload charts? You misread my message. I happen to understand this system very well and I do post my charts and even have explained it to other fellow traders on this thread. Anyway, it is what it is!

Hello, Dr.  
Thankyou (times a million) for your system.  
Do you enter limit orders every time or just around GMT 00:00?  
I`m using your system in H1, and I don't trade near the change of day/week. But I use market orders.

Never mind Dr, I actually deleted the post of my trades results because of the pressure on demands of my modified charts, I have clearly stated we should stick to the original template, the system works wonders if you can interpret the market

Yes, thankyou. I understand.  
I want to know if your entries are pending orders or at market value, or depends on other considerations.

@Walvekarraje.  
  
I've been following your post from the GMMA thread silently and it really inspired me.  
I am one of the fans of the guppy system.  
  
Sorry if I changed the color, because my eyes cannot see bright colors.

Hello hashzar, my analysis is some how deep. Back to your question I trade both in 4hrs and H1 , I have two platforms in my laptop H4 and H1 . H4 has all the 56 pairs in forex market, same as H1 . I opened the 2 platforms at same time scan through the pairs in both platform . Take note of tradeable pairs monitor them and execute. Please this can only be done with experience. Now going back to how I trade the plan. only Te51 and gann 9 on the same candle are taken in 1 hr time frame, and the 51 first followed by gann 9 or gann 9 first followed by te51 in H4  
My next watchlists pairs are cadchf and usdchf sell, let's see what happen after the cpi news

Dear tolani, excellent! I understand you perfectly now. I also know what you have removed from the template and what you have kept.   
  
I usually trade Futures, NQ the New York Open and DAX London Open. When I am done trading the future for the day, then I will trade doctor's system at a much slower pace and is very nice and refreshing. I really like it very much.  
  
Thank you for your contribution dear tolani to doctor's wonderful trading system. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f64f.png?v=15.1)

Hello doctor, thank you for your kind words, I haven't done anything extra ordinary, I only use my years of experience to my advantage. I picked the magic formula in your system and adopted when people are asking for EA , I used my brain as the EA, which you even confirm that the brain EA is best EA .

When entry candles are too long. Go to lower timeframe H1 in this case and wait for a pullback.  
H1 templete has histogram at the bottom which represents Gann 9 on H4.

Yes I agree with you doctor, I saw this signal on H4 but I don't entered a trade because the H4 candle is too big.

Becareful your setup doesn't follow rules of this trading strategy because all indicators should be Line/Blue for buy and Red Magenta for sell. Preferred buy entry when RSIOMA is below 50 and vice versa.

Thank you for your guide, I will review the rules.  
For RSIOMA, Buy below 50 and Sell above 50.

It will work well in any timeframe. But your charts are not right. The vertical lines are not in correct position. The alerts you get will not be correct.

Hello Doctor,  
I would like to ask you something. In order to quickly find currency pairs for the watch list, would it be useful to use a chart like this, with the two indicators Rajesh Reversal and Rajesh swghl st?

Here is a gift for you.  
Chart for scalping in M1 and M5 time frame.  
  
For scalping, so many indicators and alerts are not required. RSIOMA is also unnecessary.  
Alerts required are TE 51 in current time frame and change of trend in higher time frame.  
There are 2 histograms in the template which represent :  
In M1 : M5 and M15 histogram with alert on M15 color change  
In M5 : M15 and M30 histogram with alert on M30 color change.  
  
The idea is to trade in the direction of higher time frame histogram.  
Trailing SL on TE 51 price in data window or as per your choice.  
Tahe profit as per your choice.

Hello doctor.  
The indicators from this website only work on the same computer that downloaded them. These indicators cannot be sent and then installed.  
  
But your system is very good, you can't improve it, a grail is a grail, there's nothing what would be better. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1) Since June 10th until July 12th I have made 21 hits thanks to your system, and I have already written that I never set a stop loss. (I already know it's against the rule).  
  
Looking for something better is a waste of time. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Best regards

Hello Doctor.  
I saw the indicator that you put here for download. I haven't tested it either. I am very happy with the signals from your system, other signals or other indicators are not necessary.  
  
This chart that I sent, is actually only intended for people who have little time and can't sit at the computer for long time, to wait for something to happen. I only trade Gold and use a 3 time frame scanner only for Gold.  
  
Kind regards ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Then you can register for free on this website and do the download, then a new folder called Market will be created in the indicator folder, in which the new indicator will be found.

@walvekarraje  
Here is the prove of your system works really smooth in M1.  
I am not taking all signal because I have kids to take care.  
  
I believe in your system,  
follow the color only ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1).  
I don't take trade when price is far from 51 and pay attention when price bounce from 21 and 51.

The basic guideline is is All indicators should be blue/lime for buy and red magenta for sell.

For me :  
I always try and learn how the indicator/system work in M1.  
Because this is the fastest way for me to learn in real market.  
M1 and higher TF actually work the same way but different in range and time.  
When I totally understand how it the work, I will move to higher TF to aim for bigger Pips.

looking at the charts the obvious question is to ask about your subwindow indicators and there settings etc etc. this will divert our main topic . Please stick to charts with the templets provided.   
Just now people have started understanding the basic system and making profits.   
There is lot more to teach and learn as I have mentioned in one of my previous posts.

Walvekarraje jee,  
Thank you for posting your method, looks promising to me.  
Question: I want to change the color of the vertical signal lines, but cannot figure out where to look for them, I have checked all the indicators, but could not find these dotted color lines in any of them.  
  
Thanks again.

Easy short. Just follow the colors. No extra analysis required.

Install the histogram manually. here are the settings.  
For M1 : Lb 45 and 135. visualise only on M1 and alert true on 135 candle close.  
For M5 : Lb 27 and 54. visualise only on M5 and alert true on 54 candle close.

Why install it manually? You've already shared the template. I'm even more confused.

The red arrow is the entry candle.   
1) This is a clear failed breakout in a downtrend. Lower high 3 candles before the entry candle..  
2) All stars are printed on the entry candle.  
3) Gann sell alert on the same candle.(vertical magenta line)  
4) APB bearish candle  
5) All RSIOMAs red/magenta.  
6) All RSIOMAs above 50 crossing down.  
  
Everything is clear by just looking at the chart. As if this pair was screeming " SHORT ME"  
And this is the picture just now....

I draw those lines manually to mark my entry.  
I don't use lines indicator, because I follow original template for m1-m5 from Doctor's template. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Dear Doctor,  
I have a special request to make.  
I would be very pleased if you and or some of the other friends on the thread would be willing to work with me on this GBPUSD trade that I have entered as a Sell trade.  
I enclose a picture of my 4H platform.  
Just your input on how you see the trade develop and what you think will do.

Dear Worsman, GBPUSD is in an uptrend and hitting some resistance on H4 and currently doing a pullback. I don't think it is a good setup for short. You should look at other pairs and for better setup making sure that All Colors of indicator are same color in the direction of your trade.

I noticed that the RTE25, Rajesh PBC, Rajesh Reversal, and Rajesh Intermediate Trend were all the same indicator but with slightly different colors, line widths, and MA periods.  
  
I created a version that combines all four indicators into one and developed an MT5 version. I removed the alerts, as this indicator works best with visual cues, and I plan on creating an EA that utilizes the indicator after integrating the Histogram.

Dear Hashzar,  
Thank you for your input...much appreciated.  
I am already in this Sell trade because of the strong uptrend that this pair was in, but I believe that the GBPUSD has peaked already at 1.29950 and is presently hovering around 1.29555.  
It just pierced a bearish FVG from below to retest that FVG zone at around 1.29575 which I believe it will bounce off further downward towards 1.28000.  
I might be wrong if the market turns towards 1.30000 upwards again, but I shall be vigilant on this one.  
Any other input is welcome.

Becareful your setup doesn't follow rules of this trading strategy because all indicators should be Line/Blue for buy and Red Magenta for sell. Preferred buy entry when RSIOMA is below 50 and vice versa.  
  
For a sell entry, all indicators (Trend envelops lines, RSIOMA, Gann Hi-Low, etc...) must be magenta. And vice versa for buy entry.

A trick i learned in this forum.  
change #property indicator_chart_window to #property indicator_saperate_window and compile.  
  
After installing your indicators in saperate window. again change to #property indicator_chart_window and compile.

In the GUPPY RE-INVENTED document :  
  
TREND REVERSAL ENTRY: “Identify trend reversals at the earliest.”  
Specific criteria and rules for this. _All criteria need to be fulfilled to enter the trade_.  
These are risky trades and should be traded with strict stoploss.  
1) RSIOMA AND GANN BOTH must be in overbought zone (above 80) to go short and oversold zone (below 20) to go long.  
2) GANN trend reversal alert with vertical line on chart.  
3) On the alert candle the RSIOMAS should cross the 80/20 line.  
4) Red RSIOMA should be below Magenta for sell and blue above lime for buy trade.  
5) The RSIOMA and GANN lines should form a picture like open scissors on the entry candle.  
  
In your case the 5th criteria is not fullfilled.  
  
Any way reversal trades though risky, they have minimum risk and very high reward if they work in your favour.  
  
Lastly a rule i follow strictly is to exit the trade if opposite color APB candle is formed (body and wick both opposite color) exit the trade irrespective of profit or loss.

Welcome Jblanked and Thank you for your kind words.  
I always wanted a coder to be active in this thread. You will be getting lot of requests soon ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
"I plan on creating an EA that utilizes the indicator after integrating the Histogram."  
That will be fantastic. To begin with remember that Gann 9 signal is our entry candle.  
Thanks again

I do use smart money concepts in my live trades to find continuation entries using this system. Reversal trades and SMC dont go well in this system.

From my experience using this system, there is a pullback sign, after pullback the price will go up again, because the major trend bias 51 is still green.  
But no one know where the market will be headed ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1).

heya mate, question:   
  
If you have say 3 pairs of GBPXXX trending higher, showing similar MA setups, how would you choose which one to trade?   
or would you trade all 3?   
  
Thank you

If you want to trade on M15 (and M5 or M1), it is recommande to follow the trend in higher timeframes (H1, H4, Daily, etc...). All this higher timeframes trend must be in the same direction. Open only buy signal in M15 if all timeframes (H1, H4, Daily, etc...) are up and vice versa.

All your entries are technically. Rest is money management.  
It is more important to understand the logic behind false breakout.

Let me try to explain the logic behind entry after a false breakout. let us analyse the trade i am in now.  
  

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

[![Click to Enlarge

Size: 46 KB](/attachment/image/4760364/thumbnail?d=1721204508)](/attachment/image/4760364?d=1721204508)   

  
After a nice uptrend, there is a breakdown (price trading below TE 51 according to our criteria).  
When price reached support area (aqua horizontal line), the buyers tried to push it up 3 times. The price went above the TE 51 for brief moment but fell again. The sellers were absorbing all these buyers and not letting the price to go up.( area between two blue vertical lines)  
The price finally broke the support when fresh and strong sellers entered the market. That is our entry candle with TE 3 sell alert + Gann 9 sell alert.( this is the beauty of our system : identiy the exact candle ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1))  
When this support is broken all the stoplosses of the trapped buyers will get triggered pushing the price further down with momentum and without any fresh sellers.  
This is exactly what happened in the subsequent candles.  
These are high probablity trades with low risk high reward.  
Notice that my R:R here is almost 1:3 and the TP is about to hit.

Though i dont trade shorter timeframes, two timeframes higher than your entry chart need to be considered. For M5, M15 and M30 should be sufficient to enter in their direction. Trading daily and M5 entry is too far fetched. That is the reason why there are histograms representing M5 and M15 on M1 chart and M15 and M30 on M5 charts.

around 50 is ideal. But should not be below 20 or above 80.

The failed breakdown did not workout as expected. But the entry was not triggered.

1) It is important / mandatory to let the candle close.  
2) will you take a short trade here? Looks like first pullback and continuation pattern on main chart.  
  
yes/no ?

Hi Walvekarraje,  
  
Thank you so much for sharing such a great trading system. It's incredibly generous of you to share for free what looks like a successful system  
I am still learning this strategy and started using it on a small live account. I started trading your system on 10th July and I share a screenshot of my results so far.  
  
I need to learn to be patient and ride the profitable moves and not close out too early.  
  
Thanks again and God Bless you.

Let me take this opportunity to explain the diffrence between flag trades and failed breakout trades. The same chart of USDCHF i profited today.  

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

[![Click to Enlarge

Name: comparison.png
Size: 42 KB](/attachment/image/4760799/thumbnail?d=1721230275)](/attachment/image/4760799?d=1721230275)   

  
  
Notice the flag long entries in the uptrend. Valid and profitable trades obviously. Notice the APB candles after the flag. They are small but bullish.  
The reason is, there should be a strong buyer to move the price up and pumping money in. The stoploss orders of sellers can take the price up but not forever.  
  
In the failed breakout, the amount/number of trapped buyers is huge. once the support is broken, the SL orders will push the price down irrespective of any strong sellers. The momentum of SL orders will push the price down in long bearish move.  
The system is based on sound logic and understanding of price action and still fine tuned for a newbee to trade without understanding the logic behind it.  
Hope you understand.

Infact. i will wait for a failed break down entry to go long or a significant pullback continuation pattern to go short.

A caution. This works in timeframes H1 and above. H4 is optimal.  
I have no experience in lower timeframes.

Doctor your RSIOMA oversold and overbought perform wonders, most times it delivered 150 to 200 pips

Hi E.G,  
I believe the Doctor recommended that the lowest time frame for this system is 15mins. Please be aware that any time frame below the recommendation increases the Risks quite considerably.  
  
Are you using a higher timeframe to decide the direction of the markets so you are not trading against the trend.  
  
Please note, I'm still learning this system myself. My observation is that it's really important to trade with the overall market trend.  
Others will probably have more to add.

My advice is not to enter a trade when the candle is so far away from 51, and even less so if the candle is large.

Hi Kraneos, thanks for template, i was using the one that PipsArt shared, now i will try yours.  
Yesterday i was down 70 pips on 1 min gold and today i am up 70 pips, so maybe i am getting better with system or market is trending today and thats the reason, i still take 10 pips profit, i dont understand how to hold longer and where to close position, can you share how do you manage your scalp trades please?

I don't follow any strict rules, I look at price action and indicators as you can see in my charts above, so I advise you to follow the Doctor's rules for management, with the lot size you consider, explained in post 589. 

Saludos, K.

Kraneos is right.  
[https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...5#post14937355](https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/post/14937355#post14937355)  
  
I would like add to this  
In CHFJPY, a) there was no follow through downwards. In H4 chart next 5/6 candles are inside candles. The red RSIOMA never crossed the magenta anytime. This indicates poor trend and no momentum.  
b) there is a fully formed opposite APB candle, square off the trade irrespective of profit/loss. At least shift SL to high of that candle.  
c) opposite Gann 9 signal and all RSIOMA blue lime...... no reason to remain in the trade.  
This way minimise losses.  
In GBPCHF, the RSIOMA are already in oversold zone. this becomes a high risk low reward entry.

In short.  
Guppy will define the trend  
Gann 9 will point out exact entry candle   
APB candles will define trend strength  
RSIOMA will define momentum and also overbought and oversold zones where not to enter trade.

" Yeh to trailor hai. Picture abhi baki hai"  
  
The Hindi phrase "Picture Abhi Baaki Hai Mere Dost" translates to "The story/film is not over yet, my friend." This is an idiomatic expression that suggests there is more to come, or that the situation is not yet complete. It implies that the journey or story is ongoing and there are still unresolved elements that are yet to play out.  
The phrase is often used metaphorically to convey that a particular situation or circumstance is not yet finished, and there are more developments or events waiting to unfold. It encourages the listener to be patient and have an open mind, as the full picture or outcome has not yet been revealed.

Hi jblanked  
Would it be possible for you to code the same within MT4? Can you leave the option for alarms to be turned off or on?

I updated the **RSIOMA** and created an MT5 version. I also updated the MT5 template and created an MT4 template. These templates mimic [this template](https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/post/14930656#post14930656) that Walvekarraje created with the original MT4 RAJESH indicators but utilize the updated MT4 and MT5 indicators.

Yes, I posted it [here](https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/post/14938205#post14938205). They do not have alarms, and I don't intend to add them since the next step is to create an expert advisor that trades the system. I'm new to this system as well, so it will take several more hours of observation and manual trading success before a successful expert advisor is created.

Many many thanks for your involvement, time and efforts.  
For expert, the entry condition is all indicators should be lime/magenta and rsioma lines around 50 level.  
Is it possible to create a alert first when all are lime/magenta in main chart, subwindow and to include/exclude 2 histograms (where histogram settings can be changed according to the timeframe of main chart).  
Thanks again.

Thanks for the clarification I'll take some time this week and look into it. Your examples of successful trades are really helpful.  
  
I'll create a Guppy-SuperTrend that utilizes all of the indicators and has an alert system. We can use that in the expert advisor as well.  
  
A few questions if you don't mind.

  1. When you say all indicators should be lime/magenta, does that include the Gann lines?
  2. Is there an exit, take profit, and stop loss strategy?
  3. Kraneos mentioned not taking the trade if it is far away from the 51 EMA. What are your thoughts?

A Guppy-SuperTrend indicator will be a great help personally for me as my broker does not support MT4.  
  
"Kraneos mentioned not taking the trade if it is far away from the 51 EMA. What are your thoughts?"  
This is very relative term. Depends what zoom level is the chart. Also in live market the price may appear far away but when next few candles ar printed it may not.  
  
"When you say all indicators should be lime/magenta, does that include the Gann lines?"  
Yes. The vertical Gann 9 lines are our specific entry candle when all other criteria are fullfilled.

We dont trade all Gann 9 signals.  
  
1) Either the TE 51 star and gann 9 verticle line should be on the same candle or  
2) The Gann 9 vertical line should be printed _**after**_ the TE 51 star.  
These are trend continuation signals and our trading signals.  
  
When Gann 9 line appears before the TE 51 star.... this is Trend reversal pattern and right now we are not trading this pattern as it is slightly more complicated.  
  
"Is there an exit, take profit, and stop loss strategy?"  
Yes. I trade with 2 lots. Initial SL for both lots is swing high/low. For expert TE 51 can also be used as initial stoploss.  
My TP for first lot is R:R 1:1  
If an opposite APB candle is printed, before TP 1 I close my position irrespective of of profit/loss.  
After TP 1 is acheived, I trail my SL on TE 21 or 9 or 3 depending on the strength and momentum of the trend.  
  
Hope this helps.

I'll create a Guppy-SuperTrend that utilizes all of the indicators and has an alert system. We can use that in the expert advisor as well. A few questions if you don't mind. When you say all indicators should be lime/magenta, does that include the Gann lines? Is there an exit, take profit, and stop loss strategy? Kraneos mentioned not taking the trade if it is far away from the 51 EMA. What are your thoughts?...

This brainstorming of ideas on this thread is indeed great for the beneficiation of something already great.  
IF you can develop it further as mentioned above then the end product will be a wonderful pipgrabber.

Keep learning, follow the original rules, trials and errors, practicing and the most important is patience.

There are only 3 indicators in the system. Trend Envelops, RSIOMA and Gann Hi Lo activator.  
I have modified and renamed them for convinience. Due respect to the original coders, i take no credit for them.

Delete the ones I crossed out and upload the template from the blue box.  
You could also have problems because you have too many indicators in your MT4, delete the ones you don't use.

Then it may be as Kraneos wrote that you have too many indicators in the indicator folder. Make a backup copy of the indicator folder, and then delete any indicators that you don't need for Doctor's trading system. If nothing works, reinstall the Mt4 and only copy these indicators into the indicator folder and these templates into the template folder, that must work. 

Don't trade because you think you have to do something.

Hello Kraneos, thanks for the great demonstration. May I ask why we shouldn’t take a trade at the yellow arrow on the picture?

Hello friend.  
I just put some quick examples, I didn't look at all of them either.  
  
In this case that you indicate, you can follow the doctor's instructions, opening two operations at No. 2 and closing the first one at the pink candle and you can let the other one go, while the H4 histo is still in the buy mode.  
In case it is the first entry where you indicate, it seems correct to me but with caution because I see the Rsioma very high already.

Hey man, we currently don't have APB Candles for MT5. The Guppy Template for MT5 and MT4 that I posted should work accordingly. I have a few more updates planned.

Thanks for your work friend.  
I'm testing the Guppy SuperTrend of mt4 on M1 and I've found a few signals that don't appear correctly.  
Is it my mistake?, does it not work for M1?, does it still need to be adjusted?

Thanks for taking the time to test. You'll need to adjust the histogram inputs for M1. The default histogram inputs are for M5. Change Histo Input 1 to 45 and Histo Input 2 to 135.

I have copied all the indicators into indicator folder and all of them are working except Guppy Reinvented MTF.tpl which I have highlighted in the screenshot. Please can you tell me that I have to attach all the indicators to the chart which are in the screenshot?

Hi rehmatkhan00  
That file "Guppy Reinvented MTF.tpl" is the template, it´s not an indicator, that have to be in the template folder.  
  
After you have place "Guppy Reinvented MTF.tpl" in the template folder, restart the mt4, then you are able to open that template in your mt4, and you will see that all 12 indicators are working well.  
  
Please upload a foto of your Indicator folder and also of your template folder, that we can check, if you have done that right.  
  
Kind regards 

Don't trade because you think you have to do something.

My apologies brother. Try now.   
  
Also, the EA is coming along well. It just needs a few more tweaks.

Don't trade because you think you have to do something.

Is it MT4 or MT5 EA? On which timeframe do you make the backtest? On how many pairs?

It's seem correct but your timeframe is M30, if you follow the rules of doctor, we recommand to trade on H4.

Very true. Why try to analyse what is inside the system. Are the indicators same or renamed? I have given a tool on a silver platter. Just use it.  
When in doubt, look at my trading journal.

I really have no idea if this system can be backtested with so many indicators and parameters. Though Gann 9 points the entry candle, our entries are not on every alert... i will suggest a manual backtest where all conditions are satisfied.  
Second and better option is to view my trading journal and the trade list. It will be a backtest as well as a forward test as the journal will not lie.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

H4 is optimal for me and my trading because of my work. But this tool can be used in any timeframe, with a proper risk and money management.   
You will need the experience and psyc to trade in lower timeframes like Kraneos <https://www.forexfactory.com/kraneos> .

There are setups within setups. and much better entries (very low risk and very very high reward) if you understand the system.  
RSIOMA is a very roboust indicator and is very important in making trading decisions.  
for example, my trade today was purely based on RSIOMA BULLISH DIVERGENCE.

Though Gann 9 points the entry candle, our entries are not on every alert... i will suggest a manual backtest where all conditions are satisfied. Second and better option is to view my trading journal and the trade list. It will be a backtest as well as a forward test as the journal will not lie.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1) ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

I made a backtest with my EA for 2024 on EURUSD H4. For the moment, this EA is still under development.  
  
Please find below results.  
  
My setup with my EA is:  
  
1) All trend envelopes must be the same color: Lime for a BUY and Magenta for a SELL.  
2) Gann vertical dotted line must be Lime for a BUY and Magenta for a SELL.  
3) RSIOMA must be Lime for a BUY and Magenta for a SELL and must be in a zone between 65 (OverBoughtZone) and 35 (OverSoldZone).  
4) Stoploss = High-Low  
5) Take profit = R:R 1:1  
  
You can check this 19 trades on your own EURUSD H4 Guppy chart with the list of trades made by my EA.

Hello doctor.  
I have a question to understand better.  
Would it be a good BUY setup if "SWGHL" would be between the 20 and 10 lines?  
The way we see it now, there would be a very high possibility that the trend will continue towards sell because "SWGHL is at the 50 line?

Yes, but with the histograms set to M1/M5 and softer colors.  
You have the template in Post 621.

SWGHL is subwindow gann hi lo. This is a chart indicator which i have converted to subwindow for convinience. This is not a oscillator so has no relation to any levels.  
If you scroll the chart to left you ill see its posiotion change with respect to levels.

Ok, then it doesn't matter what level SWGHL is at, it is just important for a good setup that it has the same color as all other indicators?  
  
Is that right?  
  
Best regards 

Don't trade because you think you have to do something.

You probably didn't download this version that the doctor posted, that's why you don't see it on your screen.

The colors of the lines I show with the arrow are very pale. Isn't it difficult to follow and observe them? After all, the color change is important. And I think you replaced the star with an arrow to make it more noticeable, right?

Yes, you can change the colors to your liking, and the arrow is simply that I see it better.

To Matteorossi :  
Here is the setting you ask for, and I am not changing original setting from doctor.  
Doctor also already mention the setting in previous post, post 502 and 531 ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1).  
Is better you ask question about indicator setting here, because I am not the creator of this system, I just use it blindly ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1).

very good friends, first of all I want to thank you for sharing this system, and I want to ask a question, in this graph if we had entered the red vertical line, in the green candle should we exit? and re-enter in the next signal? thank you very much

If the candle is green and wicks also green then i usually close the trade irrespective of profit or loss. Or atleast shift SL to the high of the candle. in your pic the wick is grey. Any candle with grey wicks is a consolidation candle. Green candle green wick is a bullish candle. red candle with red wicks is bearish candle. This is how we interpreet APB candles.

There is a lot of discussion about the histogram. The logic of histogram is simple. For any timeframe our Gann activator is set to 9.  
If on M1 the M5 histogram will be 9*5 = 45; M15 histogram will be 9*15 =135 and M30 histogram will be 9*30 =270 so on and so forth.  
The advantage over using MTF histo there is no need to wait for the MTF candle to close for confirmation. Also M15 histo on M1 will give color of the last 15 candles (15 minutes) and not the actual candle like from 9.00 to 9.15.  
  
Add as many histograms to a pirticular timeframe as you need.  
I ususlly like to refer to 2 timeframes up for lower timeframes for lower timeframes as lower timeframes are used for scalping.  
H4 and beyond the trend is already established for swing trades so entries may be taken without histo of D1.  
still if needed add 9*4=36 histo on H4 fot D1 on H4  
Hope you all understand.

For convinience I will post a new MTF templete adding histograms of two higher timeframes by tomorrow. I will need to modify the indicator to give proper alerts that can be understood easily.

A trade i just entered. H4 with D1 and W1 hisograms.  
As you see on H4 there is a failed breakdown. W1 is in uptrend. But D1 is in downtrend. When D1 color changes to lime the alert ahould be "on H4 D1 ternd change Buy". meaning the D1 histo on H4 timeframe has changed to uptrend.

**Doc,**  
I may be wrong, but I don't see this pair revisit the extreme highs of 1.30000.  
Price has moved up towards the lower/high to reverse downward on the 4H & 1H.  
I stand to be corrected.

You are absolutely right. but as i said, there are setups within setups.  
Ordostia had requested to check GBPUSD [https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...9#post14940699](https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/post/14940699#post14940699)  
I had replied immediately to wait for a long setup [https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...6#post14940706](https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/post/14940706#post14940706)  
  
Let us analyse my entry in this setup.  
Though it does not follow the guidelines of all colours to be the same..... It resembles a failed breakdown.

1) my entry candle is Bullish APB. lime body and wicks.  
2) It has broken 2 dynamic resistances TE 3 and TE 9.  
3) All subwindow indicatores are lime.  
4) RSIOMA in oversold zone turning lime.  
  
These are _High risk_ high reward trades. Need to monitor carefully. Book loss immediately if you feel that the setup is failing _at the end of the H4 candle._

A follow up at the end of H4 candle ( blue horizontal line)...  
1) APB is still bullish candle.  
2) This candle was not able to close beyond our guppy lines which act as dynamic resistance.

_**IF**_ the next candle closes above the high of this candle.....  
1) either there will be profit booking or  
2) Stoplosses will be triggered.  
  
The buyers were strong in last 8 hrs, not allowing to go the price down and pushing the price up.  
Again **_IF_** the next candle closes above 1 and 2 .... the price will passively push up independent of strong buyers.  
At this point even week buyers will push the price up without any effort. we are weak buyers but at that point all indicatrs will turn blue/lime and that will be entry candle as per guidelines. A sharp upmove with momentum can be expected.  
  
  
I dont expect any one to understand this at this point of time but ......... " Yeh to trailor hai. Picture abhi baki hai"

To begin with just "Follow the color."  
Study the charts and colors, understand, learn, ask questions, understand the logic, trade in demo account.  
There is lots more to be a successful trader.

Hi. the histogram at the bottom does not appear in the one minute and 5 minute charts. how can we solve this problem? Can you please share a template to be used in the one minute and 5 minute charts. also the star symbol blends with the colors of the candles so many times that it is not visible that it is a star. it is not obvious.

> {quote} There is a lot of discussion about the histogram. The logic of histogram is simple. For any timeframe our Gann activator is set to 9. If on M1 the M5 histogram will be 9*5 = 45; M15 histogram will be 9*15 =135 and M30 histogram will be 9*30 =270 so on and so forth. The advantage over using MTF histo there is no need to wait for the MTF candle to close for confirmation. Also M15 histo on M1 will give color of the last 15 candles (15 minutes) and not the actual candle like from 9.00 to 9.15. Add as many histograms to a pirticular timeframe...

What's helped me the most is to look for pullbacks and not reversals, as stated in the rules of this strategy.  
  
Once the trend is confirmed bearish, look for a bearish pullback. Once it's confirmed bullish, look for a bullish pullback.  
  
Here's an example (my trade currently):

I trade mainly on asia and london session. I rarely trade on us session.

Me too, the first pullback after 51 change direction is very good, if the trend continue, we just follow the direction of 51 and 9 for entry.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Dotted red lines are entry position when I trade (entry example), follow the colour. I usually exit when the candle colour change or power candle or RSI reach to opposite OS/OB.

Thats absolutely right. These are very common trades in all timeframes. Lets stick to trading pullback continuation pattern and forget reversals.

Hi ozkanim.  
  
So I have observed that the RISOMA for a good sell trade is always below the SWGHL, in all time frames, at least for XAUUSD, I don't see any others. However, the chart should not be zoomed in vertically, it should be at full size, otherwise the SWGHL will shift. It's just an observation, I don't know if it really has an impact on successful trade, we can try it out.

For a buy trade it is of course vice versa.

Great day! I've refactored the Guppy indicators again and sped them up tenfold. Also, the SuperTrend on MT4 is now fully functional.

I'm using the Guppy-SuperTrend, Guppy-Gann, and APB Candles. The Guppy-SuperTrend combines all indicators into a simple histogram. This saves computer memory and helps you focus on the overall trend. I'll post the updated template in the post below.

Correct entry, but the market volume for buyer is decrese at that time. When this situation happen, I cut my trade and find new one.

No one know where the market will be move in next minute.

Thanks J. This was actually one of the indicator of famous Synergy PRO APB System. Unfortunately source code has not been made public.   
However, I found code for basic APB Candles. I hope you can play with it to meet the needs.

As long as we keep the losses small, with 1 win we can cover many losses.

Keep trying in demo, don't give up until you really think that m1 is not suitable for you and try bigger tf ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1).  
Before I am using this system. I like to train my eyes with other guppies system.

Hi Jblanked  
  
Thank you for your great work ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) Would it be possible to add settings to the Guppy Gann indicator so we can adjust the style, width and colour of the vertical gann lines?

Hello, first of all, thanks to doc for sharing this great system and everybody else helping to contribute. What great commitment!  
Just a question, would it be possible to code a scanner that scans all the pairs so that when all the conditions are met and there is a continuation pattern, an alert will be sent? Scan all the pairs using 4H timeframe + alert when there is a continuation pattern with all the conditions met, in order to take the trades with the highest probabilities in a time frame with the highest success rate. Saves us time and helps us take high quality trades. Just a suggestion ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f642.png?v=15.1)

I dont understand why you are rewriting all the indicetors when i have provided all the original MQL4 sourse codes.  
  
Secondly you are flooding the thread with your experrimental indicator files and templets causing a lot of confusion and unwanted comments and replies. i suggest you communicate with me on PM, let us finalise your product and post it here after it is tested by both uou and me.  
I will be forced to block you if you dont comply.

Here is a PM to me from a fellow trader and i agree with him completly.  
  
Hi Walvekarraje , thanks again for your generous sharing here on FF.  
At this point of the Thread , however, there is a risk. And that is to lose sight of your _original_ system that is based on clear rules, is mechanical and managed by a man.  
In fact, I see that many are starting to ask for an EA, some even for a scanner:  
  
I have seen many interesting Threads _ruined_ by Eas.  
It works like this: a good trader (like you) publishes his system, with clear rules. After a while, someone comes along and says "_Let's make an EA, let's make an EA!"_  
And all the members of the Thread no longer follow the original (profitable) system, to follow the illusion of an EA that - without effort and without human commitment - makes them all millionaires.  
After a while, end of Thread.  
  
EAs are just illusions, the intervention of man/trader will always be indispensable in trading ( and in medicine/surgery ).  
Sorry for this long message, but I just wanted to express my humble thought.  
All the best.

Any one who is interested to compile EA or SCANNER, communicate with me on my PM first before posting any files or templets here or they will be blocked.  
This is the first and only warning.

Man to man, you could've PM'd me instead of adopting the "...if you don't comply" mindset (we were just talking in PM).   
  
I rewrote the indicators because they were outdated and there wasn't an MT5 version. The yellow lines were from the APB candles indicator that ThriftTrader dropped in the thread. It’s a great system, and I still appreciate you and others for the guidance, but it seems like my support isn't wanted here. I’ll remove the indicators and show myself out. Best wishes and much success in your trading journey.

It has taken my years to learn understand and perfect this. It is annoyung and irritating to see experiments, indicators and templets posted without any backtest and confirmation that they are working. This was my opportunity to stop any one trying to ruin this thread and i took it.  
you may PM your indicators and templets to me even for mt5. let us test them together and then you can post the final product here. I think this is a reasonable request.

You got what you wanted, you built the robot and only you tested it. After you've got everything you need to get, you're going to ignore all these people here and disappear. I think you were looking for an excuse to do this behavior and you found it.

You're rambling without understanding what I'm saying. Anyway, I am talking about the generosity of the doctor. You should read a lot of books to understand what you read. Education is essential for peace!

the doctor has shown nothing but generosity with not only his guppy strategy but also his wisdom of using and applying it in the most effective way possible, 99% of members here have been amazing apart from a few ungrateful bad apples and I only wanted to defend the doctor against the haters.

Can't you see who I quoted in my message! You still don't understand who I sent my message to. I think you have mental problems as well as psychological problems. Anyway, I won't keep the thread busy for an idiot like you.

no need to be rude and ill mannered is there?  
also for someone entertaining to be intelligent and reading books you might need to update your knowledge to the fact mental problems and psychological problems are of the same thing. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f92d.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f648.png?v=15.1)

As promised here are the indicators and templete with hiatogram of next 2 timeframes printing on current timeframe chart.  
  
Please copy and replace all indicators as there are minor changes made for the alerts.  
The alerts on histogram are Gann 9 alerts for that timeframe.  
  
The modification in alerts is as follows:  
1) PBC alert on TE 3 is the same.  
2) TE 51 alert on main chart current time frame will be "TE 51 TREND REVERSED " Buy/Sell  
3) Histogram alerts : if there is a change of color in histogram of D1 on H4 chart; the alert will be "D1 trend reversal on H4" BUY/SELL  
  
The idea is ease of understanding alerts without looking at the chart and which time frame alert is generated on which chart.  
  
The files are uploaded in the first post.

Lastly i would like to add is that the higher timeframe histograms are useful only in scalping on M1 M5 or M15.   
H4 is the best timeframe to trade this system where trend is already formed. Histogram of D1 and W1 on H4 chart might cause confusion.

Thank you Doctor, for these changes.  
For those of us trading lower timeframes, the risks are greater when the market is moving sideways.   
I have just been monitoring this new template, and I can see where I would have lost a few trades today due to sideways movements.  
As a wise person said, one of the secrets to making money is to avoid unnecessary losses.  
  
It's also easier to follow the rules, when you can monitor all indicators on one screen.  
  
Thanks again, and may your hard work and generosity be rewarded in ways even you cannot imagine.  
It's very rare in todays world to have someone offer publicly a very good system.

Yes. Initial SL at swing high/low. After TP of one lot is reached,l trail to BE. Then to TE21 , TE9 and finally to TE 3 as the trade progresses. Keep a watch on APB candles. As long as they are in direction of the trade,TE9 is a good trail.

Hi shandybagusj.  
This indicator is not part of Doctor Walvekar's trading strategy. This indicator is part of my own trading strategy, which I experimentally combined with that of Doctor Walvekar. To trade successfully, it is better if you strictly follow Doctor Walvekar's trading strategy and his instructions.  
  
You would be wasting your precious time, looking for something better, because Doctor Walvekar has already put the best at your door for free.  
  
To your question, it is a simple pivot indicator.  
  
Best regards. 

Don't trade because you think you have to do something.

What dgold means say by "comprehensive" is that the histograms will represent Gann 9 trend in the next 2 higher timeframes.  
It can be "customised" means that you can add as many histograms of higher timeframes as per your need and trading psyc.  
For example, on M5 you can add H1,H4 Gann 9 histograms. ( apart from M15 and M30 which are already there).  
Calculation is simple and already explained in one of my previous post.

" Trade the timeframe and Not the Instrument"  
A new concept ? NO...Actually it is not new but the original concept in my first post.  
  
The histograms and MTF templete was more of on popular demand rather than my choice.

If he can compile Gann hi lo activator to a subwindow oscillator with fixed minimum and fixed maximum set to either 0 to 100 or 100 to (-100)  
This will make a huge diffence in the system.

Hello doctor, I'm Amin, I'm interested in your system, I've been involved in forex for a long time but still don't have a system that really works, can you explain, for transaction order entry, where do we start from or see it first, step by step.., do we first look at the oscillator?, for example, look at the largest time frame first, on H4, and on H4 we look at the rsioma oscillator first then the MA?

Trade in the direction of the trend.  
The easiest trade is Gann 9 alert on current timeframe. ( lime and magenta lines on chart)  
when you get this alert 1) confirm all indicators are of same color. ( the histograms at the bottom of the chart represent next two upper timeframes.).  
2) Rsioma lines should not be in overbought or oversold zone.  
Enter at the close of the candle.  
  
Manage SL and profit targets as per your trading style.  
  
Please read all the guideline documents in the first post and compre them with live charts.  
Get used to the system first. Trade in demo till you are confident.

In the above chart on H4 there is no valid buy trade.  
But H1 shows a valid buy trade as per our guidelines.

This is the way we can improve this system.   
From the begining i have shared the sourse code files with documentation.  
Darwiti has shared exactly what changes he has made "its only used buffer in _Gann High-Low activator_ indikator"  
A positive unbiased input I a looking forward to .

Exactly what I'm waiting for. I read Dr's thread from the beginning and this is what I find should be included. So that it doesn't repaint, right?

Each indicator is better suited to its creator's needs  
  
Honestly, this is just my algorithm for my indicator,  
  
and just for fun trying to combine it with the "_Gann High-low activator_ buffer indicator"

Indicator indicates and it never lies.   
I never said that your algorithm is good or bad, _it just does not fit in our system._  
Its like any other MTF Color RSI or CCi or MFI etc but nowhere close to how the Gann HiLo prints in the in subwindow.   
Please understand i dont mean any disrespect.

If the original buffer "Gann High-Low activator" is displayed as a line then it will appear on the chart like this  
  
compare it with the oscillator

I respect your enthusiasm sir, but...  
combining guppy and gann HiLo on main chart makes the chart unreadable and chaotic.   
Thats the reason i converted it to a subwindow indicator and it goes very well with Rsioma.  
Sir, we are not trading one indicator. we are trading a system where all indicators are in agreement.  
With respect, dont try to dissect one buffer in one indicator and screw the whole system.  
I hope you understand.

Changing just colors and symbols will work for you but confuse all others. I am repetedly requesting.... Use this as you like, modify to your needs but DONT post your personal templets and indicators without consulting me. I dont want 100 templets and 1000 indicators flooding this thread.  
I dont care if this thread dies as there is no one interacting or lack of activity.

Good morning, everyone!  
I’m very pleased with the Walvekarreje system. I believe it was the missing piece to complement the other system I use, the Shahab8b method. I’ll be sharing my charts here soon.  
To give you a heads-up, I’ve been using the Shahab8b system for entries and the Walvekarreje system for exits. I must say that the results from my recent trades have been extremely rewarding!

please don't hijack this thread with the shahab8b method, seems like a plug for that, on this group we are only focused on one system for enrty and exit to avoid any further confusion ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1faf6.png?v=15.1)

I had a quick look at Shahab8b COT trread and what [hope&glory](https://www.forexfactory.com/member.php?u=41306) says is absolutely right.   
You said you are using this system for exits. We are all weak in TP and Exits. So will you please explain how use this for Exits?

I think much better results are obtained when trading with trading conditions below the magenta cloud. what is your opinion on this? And of course rsioma should not be in extreme buying and selling zones

Since I started using this system on 10 July, I have doubled my account. Small numbers but it proves the system works.  
  
I was actually at a point where I was evaluating what it will take to make my FX trading journey successful, because it seemed nothing I tried was working.  
  
I have taken stupid trades I shouldn't take. Not following the rules. At times revenge trading. I have closed out winning trades too early.  
The stupid mistakes I made, annoyed me but made me refocus and try to understand the system better.  
  
I am now calmer and work to analyse each trade before taking it.  
I will keep working on staying in the trade for as long as necessary but not be too greedy.  
  
The miracle is that this system found me by divine guidance.   
Doctor Walvekarraje, I cannot thank you enough for creating such a simple but powerful system with clear and simple rules to follow.  
  
I wish my words had more power, but I bless you everyday and I send you God's blessings and protection.

Please note: I am still learning myself, so you will have to understand the system according to your temperament.  
  
I trade XAUUSD on M5. The biggest learning is to align with the higher timeframe.  
All colours of 5 minutes aligned with M15,M30 and H1 tend to be good trades.  
If the highest timeframe(in my case H1) has the TE51 alert(the star), this gives very high probability outcomes.  
Personal lesson: Be Patient, and wait for the right trades. Some days the market has no money to give.

I use a different system for my entries, where I enter the order early, risking only 1% of my total capital. Then, I wait for the Guppy system to come into play. Once the GAN ALERTS appear, I adjust the stop to TE21 and exit with a profit that usually exceeds rr >1.

Yes, but it would be better if you wait for the conditions to occur after the small time-frame histogram is pulled back and magenta colored. My opinion

The RSIOMA should be around 50 and not in overbought or oversold zone.

in this position I also experienced a loss, because the vline had formed green, and I saw that the H1 timeframe also confirmed bullish, can the doctor explain what to do if you face a condition like this?

I am constantly on the screen to find suitable conditions. I set up a telegram group. to make this and similar joint information. but there was no participation. that is, there was participation, but only as a member of the group. no one expressed an opinion. so I deleted it. my suggestion to you is that everyone should share here when appropriate conditions occur in the time frames they want. Otherwise we can't do it by looking at the screen all the time.

It is not very common to have a bullish APB candle followed immediately by a bearish APB candle.(start of new week, ie first monday candle or news impact can be a major reason) Usually there is any/some type of consolidation candle and we get a chance to re-evaluate out trade. Any way in the guidelines and in my replies also i have mentioned that if an opposite APB candle is printed, i exit the trade irrespective of the profit/loss or shift my SL to the high/low of that candle depending on the situation. After all not all trades will be profitable and money management is equally important. Our aim is to identify high probablity trades, maximise the profits and most important of all is to keep losses to minimum.

Secondly any system will/can fail trading lower timeframes in a volatile or sideways market. I trade H4.

Don't be disheartened. It's a journey and sometimes the road can be bumpy. Are you trading on live or demo account?

Gentlemen,   
  
Please not that August can be a slow month, and days without news can be difficult to trade if there is no volume in the market.

The image I posted is in H4, while yours is in H1, which is why they look different. I was stopped out in profit. Now waiting for the next pending order to trigger.

What time frame do you trade on? And how are you approaching it? A friendly piece of advice: try trading on H1 or H4. Shorter time frames can make it challenging to achieve consistent profits. Use pending orders and proper risk management. Control your emotions—if you lose what you were prepared to lose in a day, close your computer and come back tomorrow. Not trading is also part of the strategy.

Hi Eddy  
  
Is it your believe then, that the entry recommended by the Guppy system does not work??

Hello! I believe that the Guppy system has its advantages and can be quite effective in many situations. However, I've noticed that while my exits using Fibonacci were not as good, exits using the Guppy system have been much better due to entering the trade earlier. Combining the Guppy system's recommendations with Fibonacci-based entries has shown even more positive results for me. Each system has its strengths, and adjusting strategies to complement Guppy can really enhance the results

I believe it's RAJESH D1 and W1 for the longer-term trends. The doctor suggested they were not necessary when trading H4, so I don't really consider them when I'm taking a trade.

try and try agsin, if at first you dont succeed try again pal! Throwiing the towel in on the manual apprpach so early isnt going to end well in your journey to be a successful trader, no holy grail and an EA is far away from any certainty.

Dear people,  
  
to all new visitors to this thread, I would like to ask you a question.  
  
Do you only read the last page of a book and then question the author about the content?  
  
I don't think that's advisable, I would feel like I've missed something.  
  
This thread is 48 pages long because a lot of people discussed a lot of important things.  
  
If you really can't make money with this brilliant, easy-to-understand trading strategy, you should think about whether Forex trading is the right thing for you.  
  
All you have to do is, follow the original instructions. It's the same as mom baking a bread and the only thing you have to do is, eating the bread.  
  
You all should keep this valuable thread alive, going with really good contributions.  
  
A good place to start would be to begin reading on page one.  
  
With kind regards. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Don't trade because you think you have to do something.

Ditto!

True. I have used fibonacci a lot and you will find many posts in the other guppy thread.   
But with APB and RSIOMA the need to use fibo got eliminated.   
After the entry, as long as the APB candle color is in your favour and RSIOMAS are not flattening, your trade is safe. This way it is possible to remain in the trend for long time. If the APB show consolidation or the candle size becomes smaller or the RSIOMAS start flatteninng,(this will usually happen simaltaneously),and it means that the trend is loosing its strength, it is time to either book profit or shift SL to low / high of the previous candle.

I think [Eddyrj](https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/post/14962052#post14962052) 's COT system can give very early entries but it is very difficult to understand for me.  
What i recommend is to compare entries with whatever system you were/are following with guppy entries. You might find guppy entries are earlier and more reliable.

Shorter time frames can make it challenging to achieve consistent profits. Use pending orders and proper risk management. Control your emotions—if you lose what you were prepared to lose in a day, close your computer and come back tomorrow. Not trading is also part of the strategy.

I cant agree more.  
Also start with demo account or smaller trades till you get used to reading the charts in real time. Just wait color of all indicators to agree. Wait for the close of candle.

> Dear people, to all new visitors to this thread, I would like to ask you a question. Do you only read the last page of a book and then question the author about the content? I don't think that's advisable, I would feel like I've missed something. This thread is 48 pages long because a lot of people discussed a lot of important things. If you really can't make money with this brilliant, easy-to-understand trading strategy, you should think about whether Forex trading is the right thing for you. All you have to do is, follow the original instructions....

On Point. You hit the nail on the head bruh. Not many people understand this simple logic bruh. I started reading this freaking awesome thread from the beginning and it has proved invaluable for me. Many of the questions I should have asked, I got them from the first 5 pages of this thread. If you're new to this system, I suggest you do as @Michael.MSA says.  
  
Besides, I was able to come up with a strategy that makes it possible for me to enter trades on the 5M time frame using the 15M time frame and which I'm still testing right now and seems promising. And hope to share when the good Doctor approves.

I think this system is very simple, just follow the colors.  
My advice for those who just joined and tried this system, you should keep trying until you really know how this system works, without IF, BUT and HOW ABOUT.  
You will smile to yourself when you realize how easy this system is.  
Remember, do not add and do not reduce even 1 indicator in this system.  
  
If a system does not work, do not blame the system first, but check yourself again. The system did not make a mistake, you made the decision to buy/sell and close.  
  
Until today I use this system, I only change the colour, because my eyes can't stand bright colours.  
  
Good Luck ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1).

Hi Doc  
  
Something is wrong for me.  
  
The RAR files contain code that are MT4 and I must compile those before I put them on the chart. As you see, a lot is missing on my chart. I believe it is because I miss files like several copies of RTE 25 and RSIOMA with different values. But I cannot find this described anywhere. See post 14 compared to mine.  
  
I have read documentation 3 times and likewise the 2 first pages. A solution to setting up should have showed up by then.

Also be aware that this system, like all other systems do have a number of losing trades in a row. Zoom in to the statistic at the top of the page and you will see, that the trader had 6 losses in a row one time.  
  
So keep going. It will come.

I believe T21 is a Moving Average. Would anybody like to have a robot that automatic exits the trade if T21 are touched?

Why robot if one can simply manually trail the stoploss st TE 21 after the close of the candle?

This system is too complicated for expert or robot. There are too many parameters to compile into a single code.   
Manual trading on H4 plus timeframes is the best way to use it.

3 reasons.

  1. You need to be attentive and manually move the stoploss at end of every bar.
  2. If you trade many pairs, it is nice to have one of the tasks made for you. Then you can concentrate on finding trades.
  3. You can call it a day and leave the screen and let this robot finish the work.

I believe that the robot can do most of the tasks, but when i comes to changing timeframe for finding the right trade, there it is difficult to make a robot. So I will not do that.

Did you put the .tpl file in the templates folder?  
And all the other files into the Indicators folder?

It seems odd that I had to compile all the MQ4 files. But still, what is it that automatically makes all those lines that I am missing?

Hi Riskfighter.  
Go to the 1st page and download the "GUPPY MTF HISTO.rar"  
This is what it should look like in your indicator window.

Maybe you have too many indicators in your main indicator folder. If this is too full, the MT4 cannot work properly.  
  
What is written in your signature, may help to many people. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
Please also read the that: "Explanation of changes

Maby you don't want so many histo indicators, then kill what you don't need.

That is not fair. I allways read the whole thread. But not without having the chart setup. That would be a waste of time. Do you really mean, that when I cannot setup the chart, I should read 25 pages to be sure that I haven't missed anything before I ask ??? Would you do that ???  
  
It would however be fair to believe, that problems about setup and the right templates, descriptions etc is on place within the 2 first pages. So that were as long as I went. Many times. And I read the documentation many times.  
  
And when Post#1 specify "GUPPY RE-INVENTED" RAR at the very top, it is fair to believe, that this is the RAR to use. If not, then it should be removed.  
  
Post #37 by OP indicated that setup problems were solved. So no need to read 25 pages.   
  
The RAR that you show me now, has the headline "Indicators and templete **with histogram and modified alerts**." So this is believed to be a modification - not the main thing hiding at the very bottom of post #1.  
  
Post #1 really needs a refresh.  
  
But thank you, I guess this will solve the problem. 

Read post #1 !! Then read it again 10 more times before you ask.

Hi RiskFighter.  
  
That is the best question I have ever read.  
  
The correct answer to that is:  
Of course, as in every thread where visitors look in to find a "One click to get rich" system.  
  
Kind regards.

Yes, I did, thank you.  
  
Maybe take a look at the post 555, surely it's what you're looking for.

I will now quitely start reading from post#1. I might make a robot, but I will not publish it in the thread. So you will not be disturbed with my getting rich fantasies. Yes I have them :-)

Hi RiskFighter  
I'm really happy about that. Once you have read the entire content, you will know exactly how Doctor Rajesh's original system works. Maybe it will save you from wasting precious time developing a robot.   
  
For example, an autopilot in an airplane only works when everything is going normally; when things get difficult, the pilots have to work.  
  
Trading robots have no idea about trading, you have to tell them everything and thinking for them. I belive it's a waste of time. Think about it, what would be, when there really is a trading robot that could trade so successfully that a trader is satisfied. The same thing would happen as in a casino with roulette. The players who can successfully outsmart the roulette in the casino will be banned very quickly.  
I can imagine that the brokers would quickly change the trading conditions to our detriment. The brokers are used to making money, if they can no longer do that, because a genius built a valuable robot and released it for free, you can be sure that the brokers would do something to stop it. But because that is not possible, there is nothing to fear.  
  
You will definitely think differently once you have read all the content, you will definitely not be disappointed.  
Now we can think about the new trading day.  
  
Have a successful day. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
I would be happy to read more about your successes and experiences.  
  
With kind regards.

Hi RiskFighter  
The guideline documents from Dr. Rajesh on page 1 will answer you many questions. If not, maby all the content of the thread, I already gave you that idea.  
Don´t get in hurry. It´s better to study everything with patient.  
  
Also, here are a lot of people in this thread, I'm sure they're also willing to help new members with their knowledge.  
  
With kind regards

Hi RiskFighter,  
  
There are two versions of the system. The first version on Page 1, which the Doctor advises everyone to trade on H4 and higher. For that, you simply place all files except for .tpl in the Indicators folder, and the .tpl in templates.  
  
Later, he released a leaner version for M1 M5 for anyone wishing to trade lower timeframes with health warning that he has not tested on lower timeframes, but believes it should work.  
You can see the details of that here :: [https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...5#post14931465](https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/post/14931465#post14931465)  
  
You will copy the Histogram into indicators, and .tpl into templates, then open a new chart, drag the histogram on to the chart, then open the template.  
  
There are discussions about settings on this page :: [https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...vented?page=27](https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/1288141-guppy-re-invented?page=27)  
  
Which timeframes do you want to trade?  
  
Hope this helps you get the issue resolved.

Nope the issue is not resolved. Don't use more time on this. I gave up and have unsubscribed from the thread. I have my own strategies and robots which works, so I am not in any need.  
  
But thank you for trying to help.

thank god, and good riddens .. always complaining, only reason to be on this thread was to get another EA to his collection of 5000 others, lazy attitude and truth is just too lazy to use the system how it was invented to be used, suggest you carry on dreaming your get rich fantasies without putting some real effort in.

I don't know by you, but I use minimum 10 hours on this hobby daily. You cannot call me lazy.  
  
Complaining - well, I tried for many days to get some help for this issue, and I was only called an idiot that does not know how to read a thread. I have now made my own Guppy using the standard - no not lazy. However I cannot find it to be better than the stuff I have.  
  
And by the way I have started 24 threads where I have tried to share things with people. How many threads was it that you shared?? Me Lazy??  
  
You have 60 posts - I have 1.200 posts. Who is lazy here?  
  
You Dumass.

One of all the things that you don't know Mr. Glory, is that even when I unsubscribed, all comments to my posts will be visible for me. So remove that laugh and learn how the forum works.  
  
To you _and all other in this thread that cannot read_. In my footer i write "**Read post #1** ". You all keep referring it as read the whole thread. It is not what I write. And that is because OP should secure that all vital information is in post #1. That is how FF works. At least the setup of the charts and the description of the strategy should be correct and updated.  
  
I have read Post#1 many times - including each and every Word document. And I have downloaded everything and put it on charts - several times. I have been in this forum for 7 years. I am present in the threads I follow every day, including weekends. I normally have no problems. I am able to understand more about MT4 than most people, so when I this time for once ask a question, it is not because I have been to lazy to solve my problem. And you guys could have tried to help in stead of asking me to read 25 pages.  
  
Regarding intelligence Mr. Glory, let people read your contributions since you started in 2007 and let people read mine. Was it around 60 very intelligent posts? Regarding my intelligence I am shure my CV will over match yours in all aspects.  
  
I am sure Mr. Glory, that you will find some more laughs to cast on me. And I am sure it will never stop. So I end it from my part here.  
  
All other than Mr. Glory, don't reply to my posts, I want to get out of the thread. 

Read post #1 !! Then read it again 10 more times before you ask.

are you still here? Theres a really good thread called 'I own 20,000 EAs but I still don't know which one to use'. My word of glorious advice would be to join that.

Hi hope&glory.  
I like reading that.  
  
We should not let such a insignificant incident disturb us.  
We can't cure mental health problems, but we can help each other with new Forex knowledge and insights news. That's why we're here, and that's why we should stay.  
  
Look at XAUUSD this is a new all time high. It can't take much longer, that it head to the SELL direction.  
  
With kind regards to everybody. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Hello Doctor. I have been studying this thread for 15 days, putting together the templates and putting things in order in my head. I can only congratulate you for this great system. I would also like to thank the people who participate in this thread and contribute to the understanding of this strategy. I hope to be able to collaborate as I gain experience in this strategy. Thank you, you are CRAKS. 

Wisdom is gained little by little. Don't be in a hurry "FOCUS".

Hi Wally1953  
  
Your take profit could be at risk.  
Have a look to that foto, on H1.

Your take profit is much higher than this resistance level.  
Maybe that level can be broken on first contact, but it is a risk.  
  
With kind regards

Yes, no system is ever too complicated to code into an EA, if the rules are clear and unambiguous.  
It is only impossible to code a discretionary EA, when the main rule is that the trader must use intuition.  
Of course, it is always possible to code a Trade Manager EA, if the rules for the management are also clear and unambiguous.  
  
You were correct in your posts, and it looks like most people don't really know what they're talking about, but they think that they are smart and they know - which is a typical Dunning-Kruger Effect.

and here we have yet another EA fan trolling a thread where no one is interested in such traders or should we say lazy traders wanting to talk about trading ethos based on a robot .. kind of says it all to be honest, Smart ? Hmmmm, I won't comment ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f923.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f92a.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f92d.png?v=15.1) but please move on to a EA thread, what the doctor has provided is.real it's about real trading for real traders wanting to learn what trading is about and the mechanics of just that. EA are purely designed for lazy and dare I say dim traders ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f618.png?v=15.1)

HiWally1953  
I saw this by chance.  
I'm sure you know what you're doing. Sometimes one have to take little risks, but if one watch the movements carefully, nothing bad can happen.  
  
I wish you always green bips. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

EURUSD on H4 is in a nice uptrend with good support at TE 21. The Guppies are evenly spread and all other indicators are well alligned including the HTF histograms. In this case it is reasonable to beleive that the previous high will be taken out to acheive a higher high.  
  
Only caution is a start of new week, so how the first candle prints is imp. If it is a bullish APB the target is possible.

Hi hope&glory  
It's nice that there are people who are trying for other people to find out whether one can earn money automatically. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f92d.png?v=15.1)  
  
Where would we be if only one of the many thousands EA developers had created a really usable EA? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1fae2.png?v=15.1)  
_What would do that genius?_  
1\. Maybe use the automatic money maker for hisself and not tell anyone about it?  
2\. Or release the long-awaited device for free?  
3\. Or simply selling the machine for a dreamfull price without having to take any further risks? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)  
  
I belive thinking about it is just as wasteful of time as developing such a machine.   
  
A small sentence comes into my mind.  
An unsuccessful person asks a successful person, "Please can you tell me how I can get rich quickly and easily?"  
The successful person answers: "No, unfortunately I can't, but I can tell you how you can become poor quickly and easily, namely if you try to become rich quickly and easily.   
Is that true?  
Maybe one should definitely try it out one time?![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Kind regards

> Hi Doc Something is wrong for me. The RAR files contain code that are MT4 and I must compile those before I put them on the chart. As you see, a lot is missing on my chart. I believe it is because I miss files like several copies of RTE 25 and RSIOMA with different values. But I cannot find this described anywhere. See post 14 compared to mine. I have read documentation 3 times and likewise the 2 first pages. A solution to setting up should have showed up by then.

i installed MT4 on a new laptop and downloaded and installed indicators and templet from first post GUPPY MTF HISTO.  
The charts and alerts are working absolutely fine at my end.

You are refering to the HTF histogram which is lime.  
Just look at the chart and the price action.  
This is a failed breakout with lower highs and lower lows.

Though i have set TP for one lot, It is reasonable to expect the price to break the recent lower low.  
If the HTF lime histo changes to magenta! It will be a extremly profitable trade.  
As all indicators are in my favour at present except the lime histogram.  
  
I will not trail my SL till 1) my first target is reached .  
or 2) there is a bullishh APB candle at its close on H4.

As expected as per indicators, Your resistance level is already taken out. All APB candles still bulluish.

However, if you had entered the trade from where I marked with the same logic, your position would have hit the stop loss.

My entry was on TE 51  
Your mark, all indicators are not red/magenta. The guppies are still lime. I will never enter at your marked position.

When you say TE 51, it´s also mean SL 51?  
What do these abbreviations mean, TE 51?  
It´s the same line?  
  
Kind regards

Ok. Let me explain and clear your concerns.  
1) We are trading the Guppy Multiple moving averages System.  
This is a trend trading system.  
  
2) TE 51 is the only alert on a live candle. all the rest of the alerts are on the close of the candle.  
  
3) TE 51 alert means a change in the trend.  
  
4) As a trader knowledge of DOW theory, higher high, higher low, lower hihg lower low....  
  
If you learn ABC only then you can understand DEF.

I don´t think so, because left the histo of day.  
  
I belive he entered on yellow line cruce, but I would like to know it exactly, that´s why I´m asking.  
  
Kind regards. 

Don't trade because you think you have to do something.

My entry was at the TE 51 SL long (in the data window) of the previous candle which printed the TE 51 alert.

When are you planning to start trading on the real account? Also in this thread a programmer had converted this method to automated trading. but then he left the thread. i remember he shared his results. it was pretty good.

If the system were automated it would not be as profitable. The human eye filters unconsciously.

Hello Doctor, I have been reviewing your closed operations and I can only congratulate you for your excellent management.  
I am amazed by your SL.  
Could you explain better how you get such a small SL.  
I am not able to reduce them that much.

Moved my SL just under consolidation on my EURUSD trade locking in 48 pips. Very undecided at the moment.

My entry was at blue line. When i saw the chart there was already a signal (yellow star in circle) 2 candles back and price was around the close of that candle. so i took a sell trade.

Now the first target is done easily and my SL is now at breakeven. As the trade progresses i will trail it further down.  
  
  
TE 51 is Trend Envelope on 51 EMA.  
Guppy uses Multiple EMAs. I use trend envelope indicator. All the lines you see on main chart are trend envelops from 3 to 51.  
I use these values for trailing stoploss so sometimes it is reffered as SL 51.The values in data window are TE 3,9,21 and 51`from above below  
  
My final trailing SL is usually TE 3 or SL 3 (that is the first value in data window)

Today is a crucial day on my trading journey. I traded my small test account back to my original capital.  
I had lost 64% of the account(and blown another) before finding Guppy re-invented. As per my previous post I managed to double the account from my starting point.  
My goal was to recover my original capital. Today I achieved that while learning this system, and working through my trading demons.  
  
The last three trading days, I found a setup that works for me, and I use it as a traffic light system, which has been very helpful, and stops me from taking impulsive and reckless trades. I am still work in progress. The plan is now to scale the account.  
  
The rules are simple, when the Gann in all 3 screens align, open a trade in the direction of the Gann  
  
Dr. Rajesh Walvekar, not all heroes wear capes. I am humbled by your generosity. THANK YOU.  
  
Here is my layout and results for last 3 days:

Congratulations PR![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1). Couple of questions, Are you talking about aligning of Gann Vertical Lines or both Gann Histo on all 3 screens? And do you place SL at recent Swing of M30?.   
Cheers!

Kind Regards, TT

Hi TT  
You want Vertical Gann and Histo as the same colour on all Timeframes.  
I start my SL around 50pips or above the TE51 whichever is safer on the M5 chart.  
The trades are taken on the M5 chart and M15 and M30 are there for trend confirmation.

Hello!  
Have you additional filters? For example here (after bold vertical white lines) is the situation you describe but price goes not with Gann ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Please, can you kindly show several of this trades on the chart? Just drag-n-drop from trades rersult to the chart area - for easier understanding of the moment. (Coz I try to add your GMT to the timing on your charts and can't find those entries)

from your picture,the gann line and gann histogram do not align at the same time on the 30 mins and for a start ,so this cant be counted as meeting the requirements for a trade. Pere can correct me if im wrong

2 questions from this picture, please:  
1\. Maybe you take **only the first** "gann aligning" after it changes on M30?  
2\. Could you please provide your logic of the SL\TP for this trade? (we see lashes higher you SL and levels more near then your TP)  
  
Thank you for all your sharring!

Once the M30 candle closes and the Gann Line is drawn in alignment with M5 and M15, I take the trade.  
My conceptual target is around 50pips, however, this setup gives around 130pips from the star trigger on M5. I obviously don't enter the trade on the star, so can't collect all 130.  
I set my TP as high as possible, then monitor price momentum. If there is a lot of momentum, I try to collect as many pips as possible.  
I always manually close the trade when I sense exhaustion in the momentum.

I just go out of this trade with 72pips manually because it was approaching 2500.00 which is a key level.

Hi PereRaphael,  
Thanks for sharing your experience and insight. If you don't mind, it would help me if you could point me in right direction on setting up 3 tf screen like yours. When I use Guppy template, it comes with with same screen as ours for 15m but not for 5 and 30m. May be I am missing something so thought I would seek some information. May be the indicators use on those tf or template file would be helpful.   
Thankyou.

Hi PereRaphael  
That was a good trade. Entry TE 51

So, now there are already 2 good trading methods.   
This one at M5, with confirmation at M15 and M30.  
  
And the other one, the trading method, at H4 with H1.  
  
I think both are very good and very reliable.   
The only thing what one urgently need is patience to wait for the right situation.  
  
I believe that if one know that it works, then one can have the necessary patience.  
  
Thank you so much Dr. Rajesh and PereRaphael. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
With kind regards 

Don't trade because you think you have to do something.

Does anyone know if this system and its indicators have been coded to TradingView ?

The templete already has next 2 timeframe histograms representing the direction of Gann 9 in that timeframe.  
On the M5 chart The first histogram at the bottom is Gann 9 on M15 and second is Gann9 on M30.  
  
Ideally it is possible to analyse the higher time frame trend on one chart.  
In M5 if both histograms are magenta, just wait for a pullback on M5 (Lime vertical line) and continuation pattern (magenta vertical line ) to enter the trade and vise versa. This is easier to understand .

This is very very important.  
Looking at three charts simultaneously may work well for PereRaphael, but it might not be the best approach for everyone.  
Take the time to study and understand the system. It’s designed to provide clear visual cues without the need for additional analysis.  
Ultimately, it’s always better to develop your own trading style rather than trying to replicate someone else's.

One more important point I want to emphasize:  
In trading, you’re not just trading the instrument—you’re trading the timeframe.  
Each timeframe can show a different trend for the same instrument.  
I prefer to trade on the H4 timeframe because, by the time a signal appears on the chart, the trend is already well-established in the lower timeframes. If the histograms also align with this trend, it becomes a perfect continuation trade, consistent across both lower and higher timeframes. This approach allows for low-risk, high-reward trades with calculated risks.

Does Histogram repaint?

To much as for broker difference. I'd tested it myself but your broker doesn't provide opening new MT4 demo accounts.

No sir,  
None of the indicators repaint. Just wait for the candle to close.  
Broker diffrence, I cant help it.

At this point I would like to explain the logic behind "breakout _P_ ull _B_ ack _C_ ontinuation" (PBC) trades. and trading reversals on TE 51 ( only alert in our system on open candle).

1) The weekly histogram (bottom of chart) is bearish.  
2) the daily histogram ( last but one at bottom of chart was bullish)   
3) the guppy on main chart was bullish.  
THis is a pullback in a downtrend where buyers are aggressive.  
  
When TE 51 is broken on the downside... the Stoplosses of buyers in the blue rectangle will trigger pushing the price down. at the same time the buyers in the red and faint blue rectangles will start booking profits pushing the price still down. So without any aggressive sellers the price will fall and if aggressive sellers enter, the price will gain momentum on the downside........ This will happen till aggressive buyers enter the market indicated by a bullish APB candle on our chart.

Wow didn't think this way - just recommended your indicators and template without changes.

Dear Doctor, if I understand the system right,  
PereRaphael, staying **with the rules** of **your** system, can do absolutely **the same** analysis on **one** M30 **chart** only.

Hi Walvekarraje,  
  
I love your strategy so far! I just started reading and practicing on demo. I already have 3 out of 4 winners ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) I am actually using renko blocks on the Dow. I will post some trades later today when I get some time. So thanks for this great contribution to FF. I appreciate your effort and keeping the thread going.

Price is at top of weekly range so could reverse, that's the only reason I thought a short may work out.  
  
Is this analysis reasonable or am I kidding myself? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Hi Doctor. I appreciate your feedback a few posts back. I am not here to gamble but to learn, and I will be following your method as it is laid out. Thank you!

Please ignore my words about gambling.   
Your trade was against all the guidelines we are following.  
  
"Closed EURUSD trade, -11 pips. Second guessing myself, playing it safe."  
That was the right thing to do. Retrospectively looking at the chart it was a minor pullback and your loss would have been much bigger.  
  
"Price is at top of weekly range so could reverse, that's the only reason I thought a short may work out."  
Could reverse and short may work out...... this is a hope trade, and all hope trades are hopeless trades.  
  
In this system Guppy multiple moving averages act as support and our intension is to identify entry candle which is in continuation of the existing trend.  
We are following a system based on technical analysis based on multiple indicators with a hope of identifying low risk high reward trades.  
  
The Plan is to Trade when all indicators ( colors ) agree....  
  
Plan the Trade and then Trade the Plan.

Right question. All of us are trying to find an answer to....  
Let me try to answer this to the best of my knowledge and the indicator system i have shared with you all......  
  
1) Enter trade at the close of the candle. Make sure all the indicator colors agree.  
Initial SL is swing high/low or TE 51 in the data window.  
Entry with 2 lots.  
First target for 1 lot with R:R 1:1  
There are only 2 possibilities...a) SL for both lots will be hit or 2) target of one lot will be hit.  
If SL is hit you are out of the trade automatically.  
  
2) If SL is not triggered, watch APB candles. As long as the candle color is in your favour, the trade is safe.  
(lime body and wicks: bullish candle, magenta body and wick: bearish candle. Any other colour combination is consolidation candle)  
Wait for close of candle.  
As long as the APB candles are in your your favour, dont change SL or TP.  
  
3) When the APB candles show consolidation, watch RSIOMA. If there is no change in color of RSIOMA.... dont change SL or TP.  
  
4) If. a) APB candle color changes to bulish (if you are short) or bearish (if you are long) OR b) any one or more RSIOMA color changes at the close of the candle...  
Book profit or loss irrespective of SL or TP.  
  
5) TP for second lot... your choice.

Hello Doctor, I have been observing the entry in the AUDCHF pair by the colleague "desde80808" (post 1094), according to my observation if this entry had been made in H1 there would be no losses.  
I would appreciate it if you could review it to see if I am right since I am learning the system and I have doubts.  
**Entry at 0.57240. 2 Lots.**  
SL 057440 -21 pips  
**Lot 1: TP1 reached 21 pips**  
1st Decision with Lot 2: TP2 BE if SL goes to BE after TP1. **Total 2 Lots 21 pips.**  
2nd Decision with Lot 2: TP2 -3 pips if the operation is closed due to the color change of the APB candle in H4. **Total 2 Lots 18 pips.**

Wisdom is gained little by little. Don't be in a hurry "FOCUS".

Again your logic is perfect as per guidelines.  
  
More important is that on H1 this sell could be initiated at the close of last but one candle before your entry candle.  
In your chart notice the 3 flags printed by the lime coloured lines... followed by a RTE 3 PBC alert (Yellow hollow circle).  
Please read "TRADING MINOR PULLBACKS: “buy on dip” and “sell on rally”." topic in the guppy re-invented document in 1st post.  
  
Hope this helps.

We also fought against the brokers, opening spread of 27 pips, they swept the shorts and kept the money.

From the time stamp of your post I guess this have something to do with NY close and Sydney open spread increase.  
  
Copied the following from link [https://www.asiaforexmentor.com/what...market%20opens](https://www.asiaforexmentor.com/what-does-spread-mean-in-forex/#:~:text=Most%20financial%20centers%20have%20overlapping,until%20the%20Tokyo%20market%20opens). :  
  
_Most financial centers have overlapping operating hours, except for the transition between New York to Sydney. New York closes at 10pm and Sydney is just starting to open, leading to low liquidity and higher spread. The spread usually remains this way until the Tokyo market opens._

This happens when brokers run out of liquidity, some markets open, others close, and there are a few minutes when [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") go up. This is what happened to me in post 1113.

If I remember correctly, the doctor said that it was healthier to enter the process from the area I marked, that is, around the fifty level.

EURUSD trade -96.  
  
USDJPY trade -140.  
  
Both went straight to SL...bummer. Total train wreck. No attempt to manage trade, I was a bit sidetracked during these trades. It is demo, but no excuse for not taking seriously. In the future I'll try exiting trade when candle gives opposite color so not to go to full SL.

My dear friend. Please post the full picture, not a trailer.  
See how i post my pics with explaination and my trade explorer.  
  
"3 not good signals in a row." what your pic shows? there is no time frame , there is no history.  
May be this is the end/exaustion of the trend.  
have you traded these in real time? in a demo account at least?   
or are you just looking at the historical charts and trying to pinpoint the flaws?  
I will answer to the best of my knowledge or understanding if you give me the picture.  
  
Any way, I never said that all the trades will be in profit.

This is a system easy to follow. But you need to have a basic knowledge and understanding of technical analysis and use of indicator.

Then it equals tighting the SL - then what is the sense of SL calculating?

Please read and understand again .  
RSIOMA is oscillator. It will never change its position and never repaint.  
GANN in subwindow is NOT a oscillator. I have modified a chart window indicator to a subwindow indicator. It will change its position in subwindow as the chart moves.

The initial stoploss is before you decide to enter a trade. It is a calculated risk. How much you can afford to loose in the trade and what profit you expect.  
The moment your entry is triggered, it is up to you how to minimise the loss and when to book profit.

I am really sorry. Its my fault.  
I started this thread Guppy Re-Invented.  
I have explained all the other indicators and colors .  
I took it for granted that The Guppy Multiple Moving Averages System is known to everyone and i am improving that concept....  
  
Now i understand that i need to explain the Guppy first. And then the re-invented part should have followed  
  
I will do it this weekend.

If you entered the trade only by looking at the 4-hour candle, this is the wrong logic. Go back to the 1-hour chart and look. On the 1-hour chart you have found the most favorable entry moment.

Where's the Magenta sales line, genius!? This is a purely experimental process. this is not how the process rules described on the first page work. Don't make yourself funny by commenting without reading the whole forum and without understanding what you read!

I've been here since the beginning. The Dr. trades the H4 as he has stated many times. You commented that he missed the optimum entry and entered using the wrong logic by finding an entry point on a timeframe that he doesn't trade. We could do that all the way down to the 1M chart.

In the rule posted by doctor, it is indicated: RSIOMA AND GANN BOTH must be in overbought zone (above 80) to go short and oversold zone (below 20) to go long.

That's the rule for **TREND REVERSAL ENTRY**.  
For entry with the trend **All indicators should be Line/Blue for buy and Red Magenta for sell**. In the image provided by [since80808](https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/post/14980645#post14980645) entries 1 and 3 have correct colors but entry 2 doesn't have all colors correct (one on the lines on the GANN is wrong) but it get correct color one candle later. The problem in this case are  
not the indicators but the entries are directly into resistance.

Just took this trade on USDJPY.  
  
I believe this qualifies as a trend reversal trade, am I correct?  
  
My plan is to get out early if I get a closed magenta candle.

Doctor, I think this is an excellent system. It is possible that some of us need to adapt it to our personality or type of trader, conservative, aggressive, etc. The time available is also important. "IT IS WONDERFUL" I have been doing this for a few years and I have never had something so easy to operate and with an excellent percentage of success and ratios.  
In my case, I never enter without keeping in mind that the H1 chart guarantees me a lower SL, which allows me to do intraday operations that are sometimes very easy and fast. Not all operations have to be in H4. I have the necessary time to do this in H1 and improve the ratios, being more selective with the signals.  
CONGRATULATIONS and thank you very much for sharing this excellent system. 

Wisdom is gained little by little. Don't be in a hurry "FOCUS".

Well guys, I test, backtest, forwardtest and retest focusing on the SL situations bc, I remind, I think this is THAT the System we all need ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Dear Doctor, let me describe "my AAA scenario" of using your system. If you say it's wrong at all or going against your rules, then I delete this post at once for not confusing future readers.  
  
I've found _for myself_ that I get my best results (with less trades) on H4 when I take  
only the _first_ **continuation** signal (#4)  
_after_ the **reversal** signal (#1)  
and after forming a _visible_ new trend (#2)  
_when_ it's according to the **HTF** histogram (#3)  
(with the initial SL at the nearest extremum, TP1=SL, then moving SL to BE and trailing the next target)  
  
Thank you for your great work (and excuse me for my Eastern European English) ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f340.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f4a1.png?v=15.1)

I completely agree with you. Our goal should be to learn and grow together. The market is indeed our only competitor, and by sharing our insights respectfully, we can all improve and succeed. Let's continue to support each other and maintain a positive environment..

Of course, the better the trend, the better the entry. What I like most about your contribution is that you have expressed the entry of excellent quality with a triple AAA, which opens up the possibility of classifying the quality of the entries. We should no longer think only about entries but about their quality.  
Excellent contribution.

If you say it's wrong at all or going against your rules, then I delete this post at once for not confusing future readers. I've found for myself that I get my best results (with less trades) on H4 when I take only the first continuation signal (#4) after the reversal signal (#1) and after forming a visible new trend (#2) when it's...

Yes, definitely the first signal is much more efficient. You said 4-hour candles work better with this system. And did you also find any details that you observed that would allow us to make a good entry?

Boss , your buy entry is too good to be true.   
" My entries follow the Shahab8b method"  
This is not the place to highlight one successful trade based an unrelated system.  
Use this system to the best of your advantage but do not post any entries not related to this system.  
Consider this as a warning.

Be careful. The RSIOMAS are in overbought zone. watch the trade and keep a tight stoploss.

Doc do you not wait for both histograms to be in alignment or is it because you’re trading H4 you consider the trend already established?

Hi ozkanim,  
I'm realy surprised. Maby you can ask Dr. Rajesh if he can explain his trading strategy to you again. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f603.png?v=15.1)  
If one see something like that on your chart, one quickly get the impression that something about his trading strategy is still not understood.  
  
With kind regards. 

Don't trade because you think you have to do something.

Hi bitgiggy.  
This chart is an H4 chart, the top histogram is D1, the bottom one shows the weekly histogram.  
So the weekly histogram is colored magenta because the main weekly trend is SELL. The daily histogram shows a small BUY, which was already stopped at a resistance at 0.57861.  
  
To get back to your question. With such a trading entry against the main trend, it makes no sense to wait for the weekly histogram. In most cases it is only a short, quick trade that takes place, which should be monitored carefully after entry. I hope I explained this correctly.  
  
With kind regards ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Hi Wally.  
Isn't it a bit early to enter? At the moment the price is stuck at a support line in H1.  
The D1 histogram is still green. I think the H4 candle would be better if it is completely outside of the green guppies. Risoma is also not where it should be. I hope you get good luck, at least the main trend is in SELL, so it could work, but it's still quite a high risk.  
  
Kind regards 

Don't trade because you think you have to do something.

Hi everyone.  
  
I would like to present an idea:  
But first a short introduction.  
  
What do you think is the most dangerous thing in trading? There are certainly several things, but what I mean is the success in trading, which I'm sure many of you already had.  
So anyone who is successful in trading feels good and safe, and that is exactly what is dangerous. Then you come up with the idea to do it even better now, because you believe that now I got it, that's how it works, and what works with few money will work also with more money.  
  
To open a trading order in itself is not difficult, but it is difficult not to do anything, to wait patiently and to observe.  
And that's exactly where my idea comes in:  
There are many people in this group who all like to respect the tradingsystem from Dr. Rajesh. We all operate in many different time zones, what is very good for us. So we all could trade together.  
  
So, if you want, you can post signals from your favorite trading pairs every day, every moment, like Wally1953 is doing. So I mean in the H4 timeframe chart, where all trading conditions are met like Dr. Rajesh showed us. Or where all trading conditions could probably be met shortly, but only in the H4 chart.  
Then don't trade immediately, first communicate about it with different people who are currently online. In the H4 chart we have more time, the candles don't change so quickly, which is a big advantage.  
  
Don't forget: We could also create a few internal rules, such as: no trading on fridays from the second half of the day, or being particularly careful when there is red news, etc. Anyway whatever you mean could be important for a rule.  
  
Then everyone can open his trades together with the group members at the same time, in demo or live account.  
  
I am convinced that we will learn from each other very quickly and safely and can become a very good trading community. This is certainly not only a lot of fun, but also definitely brings profits.  
  
How do you like this idea?  
  
With kind regards 

Don't trade because you think you have to do something.

Be careful if you SWING.  
Another STOP due to the increase in the spread of the brokers due to lack of liquidity, this problem has a bad solution. You cannot operate with adjusted or normal stops at this time. We went from 0.7 to 19 pips of Spread.  
Is it worth operating with double stops?  
  
Reflection:  
  
1st If the first lot is a 1:1 ratio under normal circumstances, wouldn't it be better to consider 2:1 since the [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") in hours of low liquidity are excessively high and this causes us to have more losses. Therefore the 1:1 ratio is unrealistic.  
  
2nd To improve the statistics for this reason, we cannot ADJUST THE STOP in a graph smaller than H4, so it would not be better for the smallest operations graph to be H4, so the main graph would be D1.  
  
I would like to discuss this topic and know what the doctor thinks, since he is the one with the most experience in this system.  
  
If we do INTRADAY this should not affect us.

[quote=Michael.MSA;14985772]Hola a todos. Me gustaría presentar una idea: Pero primero una pequeña introducción. ¿Qué creen que es lo más peligroso en el trading? Seguramente hay varias cosas, pero a lo que me refiero es al éxito en el trading, que estoy seguro que muchos de ustedes ya han tenido. Así que cualquiera que tenga éxito en el trading se siente bien y seguro, y eso es exactamente lo que es peligroso. Entonces se les ocurre la idea de hacerlo aún mejor ahora, porque creen que ahora lo entiendo, así es como funciona, y lo que funciona con poco dinero también funcionará con más dinero. Abrir una orden de trading en sí no es difícil, pero es difícil no hacer nada, esperar pacientemente y observar. Y ahí es exactamente donde entra mi idea: Hay muchas personas en este grupo a las que les gusta respetar el sistema de trading del Dr. Rajesh. Todos operamos en muchas zonas horarias diferentes, lo que es muy bueno para nosotros. Así que todos podríamos operar juntos. Entonces, si quieres, puedes publicar señales de tus pares de trading favoritos todos los días, en todo momento, como lo hace Wally1953. Me refiero al gráfico de marco temporal H4, donde se cumplen todas las condiciones de trading, como nos mostró el Dr. Rajesh. O donde probablemente se puedan cumplir todas las condiciones de trading en breve, pero solo en el gráfico H4. Entonces no operes de inmediato, primero comunícate con diferentes personas que estén en línea en ese momento. En el gráfico H4 tenemos más tiempo, las velas no cambian tan rápido, lo cual es una gran ventaja. No lo olvides: también podríamos crear algunas reglas internas, como: no operar los viernes a partir de la segunda mitad del día, o ser especialmente cuidadoso cuando hay noticias rojas, etc. De todos modos, lo que sea que quieras decir podría ser importante para una regla. Entonces todos pueden abrir sus operaciones junto con los miembros del grupo al mismo tiempo, en una cuenta demo o real. Estoy convencido de que aprenderemos unos de otros muy rápido y de forma segura y podemos convertirnos en una muy buena comunidad de trading. Esto ciertamente no solo es muy divertido, sino que también definitivamente trae ganancias. ¿Qué te parece esta idea? Un cordial saludo.  
  
Excellent idea.

The hour from the close of the NY session to the Sydney opening every day there is a significant increase in spreads and this must be taken into account if you have an open trade because a tight stop may possibly be swept in that time frame. Then, you have to be in that hour pending of the operation, either you remove the stop (not recommended) or you enlarge it until the storm passes.

I hope you get good luck, at least the main trend is in SELL, so it could work, but it's still quite a high risk. Kind regards

Hi Michael. At this point it has broken through that support line and seems to be heading in right direction. I will try to pay more attention to price action, support/resistance, before taking a trade. Thanks for pointing that out!

I am used to trade H4 charts without the HTF histograms. I introduced the HTF histograms as many traders refer to higher timeframe trend for analysis and with the histograms it is easier to refer to a single chart eliminiting the need to swith between charts.  
The histograms only represent the TREND color of Gann 9 in HTF.   
  
But [since80808](https://www.forexfactory.com/since80808) did an excellent backtest and analysis in post 1162 [https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...7#post14982107](https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/post/14982107#post14982107) and i am sure the results of his "AAA scenario" will generate better results.

No, i have not switched to forex. I only trade Indian equities in cash. As Indian markets are open only 6 hrs 15 min, I need to observe only two H4 candles and is easier for me to enter or exit trades.In my line of work it is impossible for me to be in front of the charts all the time. I am a long term investor. I trade only 9 instruments and instead of booking profits, i accumulate shares from the profit as a long term investment.

> So we all could trade together. So, if you want, you can post signals from your favorite trading pairs every day, every moment, like Wally1953 is doing. So I mean in the H4 timeframe chart, where all trading conditions are met . Or where all trading conditions could probably be met shortly, but only in the H4 chart. Then don't trade immediately, first communicate about it with different people who are currently online. In the H4 chart we have more time, the candles don't change so quickly, which is a big advantage.

I completly agree with Michael. This is an excellent idea and this will eliminate my ignorance about [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") and trading sessions.

Also keeping H4 timeframe as a standard, will give enough time for others to communicate and comment on the quality of the trade.

There are certainly several things, but what I mean is the success in trading, which I'm sure many of you already had. So anyone who is successful in trading feels good and safe, and that is exactly what is dangerous.

Hello dear Doctor!

Are the situations right after the bold white lines the same?  
and  
We saw a downtrend left and then the uptrend right. How did you make the decision to sell (even seeing HHs and HLs)?

1) We don't consider uptrend till all the guppies are lime/blue. So the uptrend right that you mentioned is a pullback. This will be clear when I explain the guppy mma and how we interpret it on our charts.  
2) Ignoring the histograms, both the entry candles you mentioned are correct. First will hit SL and second eill give good profits.  
The question is how to manage the first trade which will hit stoploss any way .  
Look at the APB candles following your first entry. All have lime body.   
Now third candle after your entry is a bullish APB. (no lower wick, very small upper wick). Also the lower two Rsioma have changed color. Meaning either the trend strength is decreasing or this is a false breakdown.   
Here either book loss at the close of this candle or move SL to this candle high. This way you can minimise your loss.  
H4 charts give adequate time to analyse the trade and act accordingly.

After entry, APB candles and Rsioma are the best guide to manage trades. As long as they agree and dont cahnge color, the trade is safe.  
If the APB body color changes but Rsioma do not, it is time to trail SL to minimise loss. When any of the Rsioma also change color, its time to exit the trade.  
I have answred your question to the best of my knowledge.

Let us analise my current trade.  
  

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

[![Click to Enlarge

Histogram 1 : magenta.  
Histogram 2 : Lime. Long term uptrend.  
  
  
#1) Uptrend  
#2) The buyers in #1 are booking profit. So it is a pullback.  
#3) The TE 51 break is a false breakdown (star in circle on chart) because the RSIOMAS are in oversold zone #4  
As there is no follow through on the lower side for the next five H4 candles, false breakdown is confirmed.( Absence of strong sellers)   
#5) Gann 9 alert (lime vertical line). Rsioma changing to lime/blue in oversold zone and gann lines in subwindow changing to lime.  
All confirm uptrend will be resumed.  
  
Entry with 2 lots. first target R:R 1:1 acheived. Moved SL to breakeven.  
Now it is a risk free trade. As long as APB and Rsioma are bullish, hold position.  
  
If the histogram 1 turns lime.... it will turn out to be a extremly profitable trade.

In H4, entry at close of candle. Not at high.  
Even if you miss the entry, place limit order at the close of the candle. Very high chance the entry will be triggered.

This looks good so far, but I would still wait for the D1 histogram, and that is a candle above the magenta guppies. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Here I can't trust the EURUSD, I need the D1 histogram green too. In this case I miss experience. But I think Wally has a good instinct for entering into a trade. But I would still wait of green D1 Histo. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Entry is at close of candle. Below is a chart with Japanese candles, easier to see the close. Although not doing so well at the moment.

Hello friends.  
I believe here comes soon a good trading opportunity. When the lower weekly histogram changes to color magenta, you should be ready. The 4 horizontal yellow lines are possible take profit points.

The weekly histogram is Lime since march 2024 on H4  
If you scroll back the chart, more than 80% the times the weekly histogram is bullish.  
Probably it is wise to wait for buying opportunity rather than going short.

The Weekly histogram on H4 chart is too far fetched for me. I am used to trade H4 without any HTF histogram. A basic technical analysis is maximum requirement to read the charts.

This can be considered as a failed breakout.  
  
GU was in nice uptrend. Lastly it formed a lower low and lower high. Note that it tried to get support at TE 51 but failed to break the previous high.Break of TE 51 again after a lower high is good enough to go short. White vertical line is entry candle.  
First Target already done, SL to breakeven for second lot.  
D1 histogram in favour of short But W1 histo bullish (which i ignored).  
Now will not trail SL till APB candles print magenta.

That's exactly right, I agree. I missed to check the weekly histogram from the past. For this reason, I think it's good that we talk about it before we place an order.  
This might be the right way to learn more about it. Furthermore, we now know that in this case it is unnecessary to wait for the weekly hitogram.  
  
Thank you Dr. for this important information. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

I like it.  
We definitely have to acustumbrate us to read the charts correctly in that way, which also improves our experience. I feel, that we need much more convesations about the trading, even if one sometimes have to repeat some things.

Now that the last two candles have closed below the previous support, the logical target will be 61.8% fibo retracement and second 50%.  
Let us see how long this trend continues. SL shifted to previous candle high which is well above the previous support.

So looking at the previous candle is it time to minimize SL? But it looks like uptrend pullback - no?  
And looking at the curent candle (if it close magenta) is it time to close the trade? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1)  
  
Or maybe "ABP+RSIOMA color rule" is for profit (the second) trades only (not for moving the initial SL)?  
  
Thank you

Previous candle : consolidation candle. No action required.  
Current candle : Magenta APB (body and wicks) with Gann 9 sell alert and change in Rsioma color... square off long trade irrespective of profit / loss at the close of the candle.  
  
Suggest to make your bar chart color to none so the APB candles will be clearly visible, especially the wicks.

EURNZD is in downtrend as per basics of technical analysis. Lower high, lower low, previous support acts as resistence (marked by arrows) etc etc. A keen eye might notice Rsioma divergence also.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
As per our chart if at the close of the candle 1) The Gann 9 alert persists . 2) The Rsiomas remain red and curving down from the overbought zone. 3) ignoring the D1 histogram , The weekly histo is bearish....

My bad - I agree with your analysis according to the previous trend and the current resistance. (But ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) I see HH and HL in the "new" (fake? mini?) uptrend)

As for me - guppy under the current candle ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) As I understand it's a continuation signal for you - you are brave enough to take continuations on such an old trend - not for my nerves ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Perfect answer "As for me - guppy under the current candle " are lime...  
  
" As I understand it's a continuation signal for you" Not until I get the TE 51 sell alert on the candle close. And all indicatore turn red/magenta.

Hello, greetings to all, I have a question. Does anyone operate the system with m5? I'm doing it and I'm amazed by my results, and I don't let the TP reach me. I do very short scalping and I usually close in manual, but even so, I have 2. 85% of the account is positive, the system is great, José

Good morning all,  
  
Interesting thread. Just noticed so thought I'd follow along.  
My chart looks very similar but the vertical lines differ slightly.   
Any idea???

Thanks Dr,  
  
Another question. You referenced the "data window" regarding the placement of the MA's. Am I missing that, where's the data window. I'll I see is the OHLC data?

Press Ctrl+D, it will open data window, where you can read data you are looking for.

I leave you with some entries taken now. Some of them are continuations of the trend, these are in my opinion the safest.  
Please give constructive criticism.  
Sorry doctor, I have adjusted the colors to my eyes, I hope you understand. I also added a filter that I am testing, I hope it improves reliability, in a while I will have the results.

The GBPAUD trade analysis.... Equal highs followed by lower low lower high meaning resistance followed by start od downtrend, previous highs acting as resistance....followed by TE 51 and Gann 9 alert on the same candle and D1 histo turning magenta on the same candle...perfect short entry at the close of candle. Michael was worried about the previous low acting as support but all indicators were bearish, hence i had TP of one lot well below. that TP was triggered, so now SL of second lot trailed just above previous low.

I made 2 trades.  
The first is with take profit, the second trade is with open take profit to possibly set the stop loss to break even.

@DR, There is an observation on usdjpy 4hr chart, if you check on my uplaoded chart the 2 white vertical lines shows where the [histogram 1] pullback started and ended but in your uploaded usdjpy 4 hr chart the pullbacks is shorter [ in terms of numbers of bars] that can only means one thing, that the setting of HISTOGRAM 1 is wrong, either your setting or ours because i have the same chart with macheal msa in post 1,199 and wally1953 in post 1,188.  
obviously, if setting is wrong tthe signal wouldnt be accurate. please help to review HISOGRAM 1. thanks

We consider Gann 9 as our entry candle in every timeframe. Histogram 1 is representation of gann 9 of D1 in H4 chart.. D1 chart has 6 H4 candles. So histogram 1 is 9*6=54 and Histogram 2 is W1 Gann 9 on H4 meaning 9* 30= 270.

Wow tolani, you are fantastic !  
A few days ago i realised that GANN HI LO ACTIVATOR was based on simple moving average. As our guppy settings are based on exponential moving averages, i had changed the code of all gann indicators from SMA to EMA, thinking that it might work better. Then i totally forgot about it till now when you pointed out the discrepency in the charts. Since i changed the code in all gann indicators, i am uploading fresh rar file in the first post as well with new templete named "GUPPY MTF HISTO EMA" to avoid any confusion.   
Do the change improve results? Yes, I think so...  
  
i am sorry and grateful to you for pointing out...

Greetings to everyone and many thanks to the Doc for this incredible system. I have been subscribed to the thread for a few weeks and I am going to start writing and uploading some positions. I am starting with this reversal in the USDJPY pair in h1.

Josekawa!  
I looked at your chart above and I looked at my same chart.  
I'm speaking under correction here, but your reference to a reversal is incorrect. We are in an uptrend and it seems to me that this is a continuation not a reversal.  
Any takers on this my forum friends?

Thanks for the comment Worsman. Yes, I understand that we are in an uptrend, maybe I didn't explain myself well. I mean the price closed above the MA 51, the star symbol warning went off and both histograms turned green. So, do we consider this on the h1 chart as a continuation or reversal?

This is a perfect entry..  
The first histogram represents H4 and the second represents D1. If you consider the full chart, D1 is in uptrend and H1 and H4 are in pullback.  
The signal generated, TE 51 star and H4 histo lime suggest that in both timeframes the pullback is over. One more important thing is the Rsiomas are breaking out of oversold zone adding confidence to go long.  
[Worsman](https://www.forexfactory.com/worsman) is absolutely correct that that this is a continuation not a reversal. But if the histograms are removed from the chart your entry is a reversal entry on TE 51 signal.  
This is the beauty in the system that H1 And H4 signals coincide perfrctly on one single candle indicating end of pullback and continuation of uptrend in both timeframes. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Anyone trading divergence, _RSIOMA is the best indicator to trade divergences._ 1) it is non repainting. 2) it is roboust: wont change direction frequently and suddenly with each candle like RSI . 3) _RSIOMA divergence_ in over bought ( above 80) and over sold (below 20) are the best trend reversal trades.  
  
Though RSIOMA in our system has no alerts, it plays a very important role in making entry decisions. Not only it precisely identifies the over bought and over sold zones but more importantly it also acts as a momentum indicator. Also it acts as a filter to trade entry.  
To go long: if RSIOMA 8 is above 12, means the upward momentum is strong and it is a low risk high reward trade.  
To go short : vise versa...  
_Trade rsioma divergence only if above criteria are met..._  
  
The rsioma divergence has to be supplimented with the alerts generated by the system. All indicators if complimenting eachother, only then an entry is validated.  
Just a random example from my current chart.....  
The entry is white vertical line where divergence is confirmed and a alert is generated in our system.

Lastly i dont want any one to ask or start coding rsioma divergence indicator as it not the core for the system but a part of it.

Hi Michel. I think what you propose is perfect, I will look into linking an account. I have also been reviewing your operations, I see that you have modified the strategy of this thread or so it seems to me, especially in the exits. Could you explain what modifications you made, the SLs are smaller (you do not execute the stops when the color changes, you varied the ratios) and the percentage of success is much higher than that of the Doctor. Congratulations on your results. 

Wisdom is gained little by little. Don't be in a hurry "FOCUS".

Hi RafaBy.  
You observe very well. There is a simple explanation for this. It is not my intention to change anything in the trading strategy. Due to time constraints, I am forced to place pending orders in the evening by asia open, for the next day, to be ready when London open, and then New York. I pay attention to all entry signals, but only in the H4 chart.  
My pending entry for a sell order is slightly below the last 4 hour candle. Then for my take profit I look at where the price could meet support, that will be my take profit level.  
I have to do that in this way because I have no way of monitoring the open trades during the day on the computer. I can see my open trades only on my mobile phone, but without the indicators from Dr Rajesh.  
  
I use the distance from the entry to the take profit as the distance for the stop loss. Unfortunately I have no other possibility.  
  
My success rate is definitely not better than Dr Rajesh's success rate. I just started this account a few days ago. So I can still make a lot of mistakes. But the good thing about it, is that I can learn from it.  
  
Most of the trades that ended in red for the doctor were initially well in the green; he often had no opportunity to observe his open trades due to time constraints, and so later they changed the color to red. I observed it sometimes.  
  
On the other hand, I believe that the most important thing is to get the right entry correctly; everything else can be handled in the way that suits you best.  
  
For example, I really get nervous when I see on my mobile phone that the trading price isn't moving properly, I just get out of the trade when it's in plus, before it goes in the opposite direction, that's why sometimes I don't reach the take profit. In the end this can be good or bad for me, but I prefer not to get in minus when the trading price moves very slonly.  
  
If you have the time to follow your open trades on the computer, will it be better to do it exactly as explained in the instructions, that's definitely the best way to success.  
  
I am happy to answer any further questions.  
  
Kind regards

our system identifies the entyy candle with a great accuracy .after the entry with 2 lots, tp1= R:rR 1:1,. after that trail SL to break even and book profit according to APB candles or the RSIOMA ..  
  
the documents in the first post are guidelines.

There is no exit indicator guys, either book profit when you are happy or book loss at the minimum if the price is moving against you.

Had a very busy schedule this week resulting in SL being hit mainly due to " no opportunity to observe open trades due to time constraints". But a good trade to end the week.

Do you think that opportunities at the week close should be ignored?

Lamentablemente, así es como funciona. Los traders están tan inundados por el bombardeo de información que no nos molestamos en aprender las estrategias correctamente y saltamos de una a otra. Así es como funciona.  
  
Por mi parte, sigo pensando que la estrategia en sí que he aprendido de ti es excelente, los ratios obtenidos con ella son muy buenos. Llevo unos meses comparando las señales TP/SL de esta estrategia con otras míticas de forex factory como:  
  
Comercio simplificado (TDI)  
[https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...ng-made-simple](https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/291622-trading-made-simple)  
  
Nihilistas  
([https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...rex-indicators](https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/490220-nihilist-forex-indicators)).  
  
**Solo poner esta estrategia encima de estos dos "debería estar orgulloso",** independientemente de cómo funcione el hilo, en estos hilos, sobre todo al principio, el autor los mantiene, solo hay que leerlos para darse cuenta de ello.  
  
Por otro lado, la estrategia que estoy usando y seguiré usando, veo que es de las mejores que he tenido en los últimos años, pero tiene mejoras como todo en la vida y estoy trabajando en ello.  
  
Os dejo expuestos algunos de ellos por si queréis checarlos, desde mi punto de vista el GANN 9 en vez de marearos te llena el gráfico de lineas si sigues la estrategia a diario te marea y te da muchas señales falsas, en vez de esto para limpiar los gráficos y hacerlos más apetecibles a la vista he creado un **"GANN PRESIGNAL"** en un time frame superior. Un GANN de 50 marca la dirección del mercado en H4, las entradas son en esa dirección en un time frame inferior siempre y cuando el GANN superior no diga lo contrario.  
  
He eliminado la primera ventana de la plantilla con sus dos indicadores porque las entradas siempre coinciden con los colores de estos, si te gustan los colores están muy bien, si te gusta la practicidad no sirven para nada o eso entiendo yo, siempre que hay una corrección a las medias 3,9,21 y 51 los colores coinciden con el movimiento inicial.  
Lo único para lo que sirve el RSIOMA es para ver divergencias y por lo que tengo entendido de esta plantilla es una plantilla pura sangre si el mercado esta fuerte la señal no falla (Esto es lo que más me gusta de ella).  
  
Los promedios que no aportan nada salvo la parte visual los he eliminado.  
Bueno, hice algunos cambios más, en la parte visual pero no en la esencia, solo pretendo simplificar el trading y adaptarlo a mi. También adapté la estrategia a marcos temporales más pequeños M1_M5_M15, para operaciones intradía y scalping.  
  
Por ultimo comentar, he leido en alguna parte de este hilo que no debiamos hacer cambios sobre esta plantilla inicial, disculpe si algun momento lo he molestado, lo que hice fue adaptarla a mi y simplificar la plantilla que no la estrategia pues en esencia como dije es de lo mejor que vi en los ultimos años, mi más sincera enhorabuena me ayudado mucho.Dejo unas imagenes para que vea como queda mi plantilla.

Hi, how are you.  
I have a question. What do you think? Why do currency prices always go to the support and resistance lines?

"Lamentablemente, así es como funciona. Los traders están tan inundados por el bombardeo de información que no nos molestamos en aprender las estrategias correctamente y saltamos de una a otra. Así es como funciona."  
True. i have been using Guppy system for many years now and very successfully Simply because of its ease to identify trends.  
  
"Solo poner esta estrategia encima de estos dos "debería estar orgulloso", independientemente de cómo funcione el hilo, en estos hilos, sobre todo al principio, el autor los mantiene, solo hay que leerlos para darse cuenta de ello."  
Every strategy has advantages and disadvantages. None will work in sideways market. The only important thing is to keep losses to minimum. In this system it is very easy to trail stoploss looking at the data window. The stoploss levels are always at dynamic support or resistance. one of the best method is to place initial SL at the fourth value in the data window and as the trade progresses' in your favor, move SL to 3rd,2nd and 1st values to minimize loss and maximize profits. TP is always according to traders greed. It is always good to exit trade when you feel that the profit earned is sufficient.  
  
"Por otro lado, la estrategia que estoy usando y seguiré usando, veo que es de las mejores que he tenido en los últimos años, pero tiene mejoras como todo en la vida y estoy trabajando en ello."  
Any suggestions and improvements are most welcome.  
  
"Un GANN de 50 marca la dirección del mercado en H4, las entradas son en esa dirección en un time frame inferior siempre y cuando el GANN superior no diga lo contrario."  
i cant agree more. i have also changed the setting Lb = 51 and take trades on PBC alerts in that direction.  
  
"He eliminado la primera ventana de la plantilla con sus dos indicadores porque las entradas siempre coinciden con los colores de estos, si te gustan los colores están muy bien, si te gusta la practicidad no sirven para nada o eso entiendo yo, siempre que hay una corrección a las medias 3,9,21 y 51 los colores coinciden con el movimiento inicial."  
The strategy can be stripped down to three moving averages 9,21,51 and one Rsioma 12 but it will require further analysis before entering the trade. With this chart i can spot entries in one second and need not think twice for trading without fear. Look at the chart below. All the flag entries after the yellow vertical line( weekly trend changed to bearish) and marked by rectangle..... easiest trades, minimum risk and huge reward. This will not be possible if you strip the chart naked.  
  
"Lo único para lo que sirve el RSIOMA es para ver divergencias " "Los promedios que no aportan nada salvo la parte visual los he eliminado"  
Here i disagree. I love RSIOMA indicator and i rarely use it for divergence (as i have used it today for my current trade).  
RSIOMA is a very smooth and robust indicator. it wont change direction like RSI with every opposite candle. Also it indicates how much moment is possible in the trend. A bullish RSIOMA below 50, i expect a strong up move. I also use it as a momentum indicator. 8 cross 12 from below above indicates a strong bullish trend and vise versa. In fact i don't trade unless 8 is above 12 for going long and vise versa.   
  
"Bueno, hice algunos cambios más, en la parte visual pero no en la esencia, solo pretendo simplificar el trading y adaptarlo a mi. También adapté la estrategia a marcos temporales más pequeños M1_M5_M15, para operaciones intradía y scalping."  
Change template as per your requirement and make profits. That is what the forum and this thread is for. A sincere request : please do not post your modified charts here. Some one will definitely ask for Template file and unnecessarily the thread will be flooded with files and templets causing confusion.   
And yes the system works in all time frames.

Not on the horizon and dont expect one .  
Creating a EA for this system will require a lot of coordinated work, testing, retesting, finding and correcting errors etc etc. No coder will be ready to do it for free.

Please,  
  
click on it with the mouse and  
press the right button:  
  
on the list that appears,  
open the "list indicators" and  
  
scroll the menu ...  
  
see the main window and the  
subwindows  
  
(that contain  
the indies you are looking for)

Hi Michael, the price seeks liquidity in the markets and as a consequence it crosses or touches those support and resistance zones, as they are commonly called. In reality, what the price is doing is seeking its efficiency by reaching those zones. If you look closely, most of the time when it reaches those zones it breaks a maximum or minimum by just a few pips when the zone works. Entering these zones works better if there is a FAIR VALUE GAP beforehand, although what I am telling you has nothing to do with this thread. This has been studied for many years now and is now called smart money, but in the past it was called in many other ways. In the end, it is price action. It is all the same, whatever you call it, do not be fooled.  
If you do not understand what I am saying, I recommend that you study "Smart money" it will help you understand price action.

Hi RafaBy  
Thank you for the kind answer.  
Let me explain why I asked. Unfortunately there have been no more posts about this excellent trading system from Dr. Rajesh for some time now. It is probably like already written: “Everything has been said and sufficiently explained”. It looks like that there is no further interest in making helpful contributions.  
So I thought I would write a question to an active member of this thread about an interesting topic that should be basic knowledge for every active forex trader.  
  
I already knew this answer, I read about it a time ago. I wanted to ensure that this valuable thread was continued with further contributions.  
You are the second person who very kindly pointed out to me that my post had nothing to do with this thread, a friendly member had sent me a private message.  
I had written another post with this topic, but then I immediately deleted it.  
  
What one should do if there is nothing more to say?  
Such a valuable thread from one of the best trading system ever should keep alive. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Kind regards 

Don't trade because you think you have to do something.

Hi Michael, I am really grateful for your contribution and concern to keep this thread alive !  
There are no posts in the thread probably because i have been clear enough to discourage flooding of posts with indicators , templets , and EAs which may cause confusion among readers. Be assured i am receiving many personal messages thanking, encouraging and congratulating me for a good system. Most important is traders are making profit using the system.  
All agree that the system has excellent entry signals but exit is a major issue as with all other systems and it is ususlly left to the psycology of the trader. Sometimes we book profit too early and sometimes we take losses more than expected. I was working on a good _exit strategy_ to compliment the system . That is the reason you might be seeing major losses in my trade explorer as i was testing live in demo account.  
  
We are celebrating Diwali and tomorrow is "Lakshmi Pujan" that honours Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, prosperity and fortune.  
Tomorrow i will be introducing EXIT INDICATOR which i have compiled using ChatGPT. The results are quite encouraging. I hope it will make the system much better and more successful.

Hi Dr. Walveka, thank you for sharing this thread and your post. I use a Guppy for my long term portfolio.  
  
I've done well. I'm long only (only the SP500 or Nasdaq) and have built up my portfolio over the years. I add a bit by bit relying only on H4 or sometimes the daily.   
  
I get out when it goes against me and get back in when I see it go green. I've been wrong a lot of times (missed profits) but long term this has been the only system that really works.  
  
I hope to contribute to this thread. A+ also that you are a cancer surgeon ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) Cancer research is one subject that is dear to my heart. Enjoy your celebrations!

This is the exit/re-entry indicator I was talking about. I dont know who originally coded it, with due respect to him,I have grossly modified it using ChatGPT and renamed it to suit the system.  
I have not tested it on live market but visual/manual backtest on charts looks promising.  
  
A couple of things to consider before using this indicator.  
1) When ever you feel you have made adequate/satisfactory profit, book it and exit the trade. Let the market do whatever it wants.  
2) Trailing SL at the data window values is still a good option. The TE 21 value (Third value in data window) or TE 9 (second value in data window) during the initial phase of the trade ( to prevent stopping you out prematurely in a good trend) and TE 3 (first value in data window) when profits are better than expected is what i do during my trades.  
3) I always trade with 2 lots and book profit of one lot at R:R 1:1. Then trail second lot to breakeven and above. I have been practicing this for many years with good results.  
4) Always place SL in the system when trade is initiated.  
5) Trading timeframes H1 and above is safer and more profitable in this system ( This is my personal opinion and i dont mean to hurt any one who is good at trading in lower timeframes) H4 is the best.  
  
Always trade in demo account first, test the system and if you feel comfortable and confident only then trade in live market.

I also created (not modified ) two more indicators related to rsioma, using ChatGPT, in quest of good exit indicator. Though they might not serve for a good exit, still they might be useful to traders using rsioma in their strategy.  
One draws arrows in subwindow when two rsioma cross ( not the standard rsioma and ma cross). this indicator has no alerts.  
The Second draws vertical lines on change if slope and color of the rsioma line. this indicator is with alerts.  
  
As far as i know, such such indicators do not exist.  
To use them in our system just drag them into the rsioma window.  
The cross serttings are 8 and 12 and the slope change is for Rsioma 12 which we use in our system. settings can be changed or modified.

Absolutely agreed. I am a long term investor . i choose 5 to 6 instruments per year usually in January using fundamental analysis of PE and ROCE using MAGIC formula sorting out only GROWTH stocks. i only buy stocks in uptrend using Guppy and when approximately at 10% profit i exit a part, approximately 75 % quantity and retain the remaining 25% in my portfolio for ever. Again I buy the same script after a pullback is over and repet this cycle for 1 year. I always invest a fixed amount every time for all the stocks. I maintain a excel sheet of all my transactions meticulously so i know at any moment where i stand. I have color coded the excel sheet so at a glance i know what to buy or sell.  
Guppy makes it very easy to make decisions and this system used in H4 or D1 is just what i need.  
This is how my excel sheet is for today. this is inspite of indian market down by almost 10%

The order flow analysis in charts like GoCharting is much better to understand "Smart Money". The only data needed is Delta, Cumulitive Delta in real time. It is wonderful if combined with Guppy system even for scalping in 1,3,5 min charts. For long term it is phenomenal.  
I am using GoCharting for last 2 years and will be happy to share my method. but not on this thread please.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Hello walvekarraje. I don't know the Gocharting platform in depth, I've never used deltas combined with GUPPYS, I think it's a very interesting and intelligent idea, apparently you've already developed a system. I would be very interested in following it and supporting you to the extent of my knowledge. If you decide to open another thread with this other system you can count on my full support.  
Regards.

I did a visual backtesting for a few years and I was really surprised at how reliable this indicator is in relation to your strategy teachings. It does what you say. This indicator is really good. Thanks again for your effort. Congratulations.

Hi thefxpros.  
I'm sorry. That template was the content of a concern that has nothing to do with this thread.  
It was a mistake to post this chart, unfortunately I couldn't undo that. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)  
Please excuse me.

Hi Rajesh. First of all, thank you for the new exit indicator.   
  
Secondly, I may be asking the obvious, but, I really want to improve on placing the Trailing SL. Whenever you get a moment, can you please share a screenshot of your Data Window and highlight the three values you are referring to as good SL options? Thank you.  
  
1\. The TE 21 value (third value in data window)  
2\. TE 9 (second value in data window)   
3\. TE 3 (first value in data window)

**Dear Doc,**  
Regarding the above two indicators; I note that when I'm in a Sell trade and the alert comes in to warn/consider that I exit the trade it mentions the opposite direction(**not the direction that I'm in**) does that mean that there's a change to the opposite direction for me to consider taking?  
I just need to get a clear understanding of this.  
  
Thanks again for your great input since the start of the thread.

You are speaking about the [RAJESH GUPPY EXIT.ex4](https://www.forexfactory.com/attachment/file/4834162?d=1730462058) indicator.  
This is the one which deaws Histogram: LIme above 0 level and Magenta below 0 level.  
  
When all the histogram is printing Lime lines and the last line is magenta at the close of the candle, the indicator will alert "Consider Exit Long OR Re-enter Short ". This means that if you are long you should consider exiting long position. But if the trend is bearish and you are not in trade then you can consider entering a short position.  
This indicator is to be used as a Exit indicator or a reentry indicator depending on the Guppy trend. This indicator _does not indicate reversal of trend._

A couple of things to consider before using this indicator. 1) When ever you feel you have made adequate/satisfactory profit, book it and exit the trade. Let the market do whatever it wants. 2) Trailing SL at the data window values is still a good option. The TE 21 value...

Sure.  
  
There is no change in the settings except gann vertical lines at Lb 51. Trade in direction of these lines.  
There are few improvements:  
\-- Exit indicator added. it is the bottom histogram in the chart. alerts enabled.   
\-- the other histogram color width increased so it will be easy to read the change in exit indicator.  
\-- All alerts modified so that the understanding of what is happening on chart is greatly improved.

Few important tips/guidelines to be stressed at this point of time:  
  
Our basis of trade is to follow the trend.  
\--Guppy decides the trend.   
\--Reversal or change in trend is indicated by TE 51 (" TE 51 TREND REVERSED ") alert ( indicated by star in circle on chart ) OR Rajesh swghl current alert ("CURRENT TF TREND REVERSAL") alert ( indicated by vertical dotted line on chart). Both will be always on the same candle. this is done purposefully by me to stress on reversal of trend. Fake breakouts and breakdowns are possible so it is important to monitor the trade.   
\--Do not trade reversal trades based on PBC alerts or Rajesh Exit alerts. these alerts indicate loss of momentum in the current trend and do not indicate reversals.  
\-- H4 is my preffered and recommended timeframe.   
  
Lastly trade in demo account, get used to the system.

Hello Maxus182. It cannot be solved with physical means (template), if you do not have to apply mental means (knowledge in the system). You have to be very patient with the current market where there is no clear direction (do not enter). From my point of view you have to be very selective in addition to applying the rules of the strategy you have to wait for the second histogram to be aligned, that is, that the trend in operating time is in momentum, plus higher time frames aligned. If you do it this way you will carry out fewer operations with a higher percentage of success (more signal quality) you will avoid that in the moments of DD the system generates doubts, all systems go through this situation, trading with another trend system will not improve your trading, only your experience will improve it.  
It is not a problem with the system but with how it is applied, in easy markets the system does not fail, in markets like the current one the experience in the system is everything.  
  
This is what I mean by being patient. Enter in the direction of the 2nd histogram H4 (SELL on H1) ignore the 1st histogram on H1.

Guppy is a trend trading system and not meant to trade breakouts and reversals. Pullback continuation pattern (PBC) is the method for entering traades in the direction of the trend.  
let us see the same EURUSD chart and there are multiple possible entry candles to take a short trade.

The basic principle is to enter trade only when all indicators are of same color.(Red/Magenta for short and blue/lime for long)  
The vertical magenta dotted line is where the bearish trend has started on H4 and the vertical lime line is where the the trend has ended.  
After the magenta line the bias should be to take only sell trades.   
The red vertical line is where the trend has turned bearish on weekly timeframe.Here there will be alert and message " W1 TREND REVERSAL ON H4 Sell " This is the first short sell trade.   
Even if this trade is missed, watch the APB candle color. Notice the small lime color APB candles.. these are tiny pullbacks and a short entry is possible after the close of next magenta APB candle.  
Similarly notice the flags created by guppy lime color lines. This is a pullback. The end of this pullback will "PBC PATTERN sell " alert and yellow circle above the candle on the chart. These are also valid short entry candles.  
The yellow Guppy line which i have stressed is the TE 21 line. This is represented by the third value in data window. I use this value to place my initial SL when i enter the trade. I trade 2 lots. The target of first lot is = My SL . This is R:R 1:1...When first target is acheived, I trail my SL for the second lot at TE 9 and finally at TE 3. These are the second and first values respectively in the data window.   
I never trade pullbacks or breakouts.   
I trade only H4 charts and for me these are the easiest method to trade the markets.

When the first higher high is printed, it signifies that the trend is losing momentum even though the weekly histo is bearish.This is where you should move to another chart or other trading opportunity.  
At the end of the chart the RSIOMA has made a lower high signifying that the bearish momentum is resumed.

Which LTF you trade? May be i can help you. also let me know if you use MTF for reference...  
For LTF, subwindow indicators are not required. Only Guppy and APB candles are more than sufficient for scalping.

I tested the 4-hour timeframe this week and observed no opportunities on six major currency pairs, with only one opportunity appearing on BTC/USD.  
  
\- Is this valid position? as the second histogram not in red?  
\- Also what best lower timeframe u suggest for intraday?

Respected Walvekarraje, I am extremely thankful for your contributions, form which I learnt a lot. Will you elaborate more about your LTF strategies using Guppy and APB candles as you have mentioned. I would be highly grateful again.

Trading LTF with Guppy and APB :  
  
1) To understand this trading system please read Guppy document and APB documents first.  
2) It is advisable to know at least few basics of trend trading like Dow Theory. Trend lines, flags and channel breakouts. These will supplement and or confirm entries taken using this system.  
3) GUPPY APB is a trend trading system. Wait for the trade to manifest itself. Wait for candle to close. All entries are at the close of the candle. Alerts are also at the close of the candle but you can change to open candle if you want. I do not recommend it. Do not trade very big candles or candles with large wicks.  
4) The entry candle should be at par with the previous candle visually in current timeframe, not too big, not too small.  
5) No counter trend entries are recommended. Always trade in the direction of Long term Guppies. Dow Theory is only to enter in direction of trend and avoid counter trend entries.  
6) This is not Holy Grail. There will always be winning and losing trades. The aim is to keep losses at minimum and ride the trend as long as possible.  
7) RTE 21 is a HARD STOPLOSS. So the risk is predefined before entering the trade. According to money management if the risk is greater than the max allowed, do not trade, or keep SL as per your money management protocol.  
8) As it is a trend trading system, the R:R is 1:2. I always recommend trading with 2 lots. TP of one lot is with R:R 1:2 with pre defined initial SL at RTE 21. Shift to BE or trail SL to RTE 6 value when TP 1 is achieved for the second lot.  
  
DO NOT :  
1) Add or delete indicators from the template or try to strip down the system to minimum indicators. This is a visual trend trading system easy to understand and follow.  
2) You can add indicators or remove them but do not post pics on the thread. It will confuse others.  
3) Do not ask for Dashboard with alerts. I will post a screener/dashboard in my own time and explain how to use it.  
4) Do not ask if the system is available on any other platforms like MT5 or trading view. I use MT4 only. All the settings are in the template. Design/replicate the system in other platforms.  
5) DO NOT ask for EXPERT ADVISOR or AUTOMATED TRADING USING THIS SYSTEM. Because I know it can’t be done.  
6) I am a long term investor in Indian market in equities. I do not trade forex. In forex I trade in demo account only in my free time. But this system I do use in futures and options in Indian market whenever I get a good opportunity on M30 chart. I usually sell options for passive income. So please don’t ask me what pairs I trade and which sessions I trade.  
  
Lastly:  
1) These are recommendations, not rules.  
2) Understand and study the system, get used to it, trade in Demo account first. When confident trade in real account.  
3) This is to be used on 30 min TF. It can be used on M15 or H1.I don’t recommend below M30. H4 and above are already discussed.

In the above chart, when the candle closes below the RTE 51 (1) line, an alert " GUPPY 51 TREND REVERSED " will be generated and SWGHL magenta vertical dotted line will be drawn. Athe LONG TERM GUPPIES (2) are already bearish. a short trade at the close of such a candle is justified. SWGHL lines represent the short term GUPPY TREND CHANGE. At this point as the ST guppies are not clearly visible on chart in live market, vertical lines make it possible to understand this trend change.  
A second short entry also becomes a possibility when ST guppies are clearly visible on chart and a pullback as mentioned in the guidelines.

Look at this chart. even though there is a buy signal on both long (white arrow) and short term guppies (lime vertical line), there is no clear trend visible.. Avoid such charts.

On the other hand, this chart you can see a nice uptrend with a clear pullback. it will be worth to wait for PBC buy alert and a bullish APB candle to close to go long.

This is a right question. In guidelines I have clearly mentioned TP 1 = R:R 1 :2   
Answer is 1) I knew i will not be able to monitor the trade due to my working hours. So keeping TP 1 at R:R 1:1 , my intension was to book one profit so that at least my trade does not go into a loss with second lot also R:R 1:1 . Unfortunately TP 1 was never hit and both lots hit SL.  
  
This is the problem of trading LTF... 1) you need to be in front of the monitor all the time. 2) Fear and Greed will take you out of the trade in a loss or minimum profit.   
  
Any way, This system concentrates on the Entry and initial SL after entry. And as always there are no rules but only Guidelines. Executing and monitoring the trade is indivisual perspective.

SL to BE... Changing TF to H4.... H4 is more comfortable for me to monitor.

EJ on H4 , the price is far above our moving averages , more likely to have a major pullback. So trail SL to RTE 6/ first value in data window.

Would like to start off and say Thank you for sharing this strategy! Ive downloaded everything and added it to a demo account to mess around with. 2 problems.  
1\. When i download the latest indicators and template, everything is installed into the respective folders. I load the template and its a pitch black screen lol. Any thoughts?  
2\. Can i PLEASE enquire into your color pattern and colors. Are they custom? if so, would you share the numbers? Just cause your chart is so apealing on the eye. Kind of sick of the color scheme I have and i cant seem to mimic yours. Ive messed around with greens and pinks/purples but just cant get it right. Yours is electric if i might say.  
Again, thank you, if you dont feel like sharing your colors thats cool too B)

As expected EJ is in pullback. Trailing SL hit but on M30 price inside short term guppies. Long trade possible as per our strategy.  
Holding on to UJ with SL and TP in place. Will let it run its own course as it is a risk free trade.

i use both. the first one on equities on H4 as a long term/positional trade. 80 to 90 %. the second on M30, only if i have time and i can spot a good trade especially on NIFTY.

When the price approaches the upper and lower bands, more successful results are obtained when the formation occurs. The first system you shared is my favourite. Doctor, if you want me to delete the indicator here, I can delete it right away.

Rather than the height of the wave here, if the wave is short, the formation of a double crest seems more useful. do you agree with me friends.

The system definitely works best on stocks, on D1, H4 and H1. It can also be done intraday on M15. Here are some active entries on H4.  
I risk 0.50% of the account per operation, the closings are first R1, I partially close and protect BE, the rest of the lot R10 with trailing to the average 51 or 21 as I see it. There are operations that can last more than 30 days. Quiet and reliable trading.

The details are already explained in this thread. Mr. Walvekarraje's strategy applied to CFDs on shares or pure shares is more profitable than applied to currencies or commodities. Shares are more trend-oriented, "this system is trend-oriented."  
If we choose trend-oriented products and apply good money management, it is difficult to lose.

Thank you for your kind words !  
A short recap... the basic is the same as discussed in this thread. I always trade with 2 lots. TP 1 = SL. Once TP 1 is hit, SL of second lot to BE. This makes the trade risk free and then take advantage of the trend as long as possible,

One more surprise for you guys. There is a MTF version which i have not included. That is what i am using now. I am waiting for two things..  
1)You all should get used to this version. Trade in demo accounto first. Post live charts using this templete.  
2) Waiting for the dashboard to get working. Master MwlRCT is helping generously for the same. his latest version looks very promising which i am testing now. A working dashboard may make a great diffrence and we all can be on the same page ( I suppose ).

You have taught many of us here something much more virtuous than making us earn money. and that is to do good for nothing. believe me, I remember your sacrifice every day in my daily life and think about how I can adapt it to my life. Knowing that there are people like you, even if it is a little, is a very powerful reason to make this world livable despite everything.

Your message truly touched me. Knowing that my efforts go beyond trading and inspire others in a meaningful way is the greatest reward. We all have the power to make the world a little better, and I'm grateful to be part of a community that values kindness and selflessness.

Welcome and best of luck .  
Your chart clearly shows lower high and higher low. Look at my previous three charts. there is clear HH,HL or LH,LL pattern.  
This can be a profitable trade but one i will avoid.

Be assured till all APB candles are lime  
Suggestion is: when price reaches the trendline, shift your SL to BE.  
I can be wrong but this is just a suggestion.

Yes. That is the MTF version a was talking about.   
It helps to trade H4 on M30 and H1 and also filter trade entries. I just wanted you guys to get used to this version first.

I keep initial SL at RTE 21 or RTE 50 but as the trade progresses in my direction I shift SL to BE. As i trade H4 it gives me enough time to reevaluate the trade. As it is a trend trading system and i take continuation trades only the chances of loss is minimal. Once in profit the risk becomes Zero.  
This is a demo account.   
  
In my real account Indian market hours and my working hours are same, so i do not get time to keep watch on the screen. So i usually sell options on H4 so that the time decay works in my favour and need to observe the chart is minimal. Once in profit I need to just wait for the option to zero. But that happens only at expiry. I dont wait that long. I book profit when the price falls to 70% of my selling price. Indian market is only 6 hrs 15 min so trend goes in my direction on day 1 and 2, it becomes apassive trade and i just wait for target to hit.  
  
I use the demo account to get used to the charts, precise entries, modify and upgrade the alerts and define targets.

1) It was in downtrend forming lower highs and lower lows.   
The entry candle has clearly broken the previous two lower highs and closed beyond that. Indicating Change Of Character.  
2) The vertical lime dotted line printed on chart is RTE 51 signal indicating start of uptrend.  
3) After the vertical line there was a small pullback just below RTE 6 (Yellow dot) Immediately followed by entry candle which closed above RTE 6 (white dot). Also the subwindow lines changed from magenta to lime indicating continuation pattern.  
4)All the guppies on chart are lime indicating Uptrend.  
Hence the Long Entry.  
My entry candle is a large candle as compared to others, So my SL is at the low of the same candle.  
If the trend continues up, I expect this low to be defended.  
Also as long as the APB candles are lime, I will stay in the trade.

What you are talking about is trend reversal entry with a combination where RTE 51 and RTE 21 alerts appear on the same candle. This is already defined in Type 1 entry in my guidelines. Out of the three entry types I have defined you are practicing only one subtype of Entry 1. This is a good practice to follow one single strategy and perfect it.  
  
"i feel we all should do testing with different combinations as we'll come to a conclusion early". This I dont agree. I have spent a lot of time to properly define the system and prepare the guidelines.All the permutations and combinations for a low risk high reward trade are already defined. I have already done the Thinking part. What you have to do is only the Learning part.  
I dont mean to discourage you but i will suggest you read and understand the system and the guidelines properly, practice in demo account, perfect it before taking live trades.

If you can define entry, exit, stoploss, trailing stoploss, take profit, breakeven, re-entry for all the three types of entries i have in the guidelines...And a coder to do all this ....Yes.... then it is possible.
