Thanks Almo for your generosity. Looking forward to your video. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f600.png?v=15.1)  
  
Does the time frame has to be 1 minute or can it be used for higher TF's?

Hi Almo,  
  
Kindly check my chart. There is not uniform color/missing color on the CCi filters. Is this common?

Hi There,  
  
Thank you for your system and thank you for your video explanation....  
  
I have couple of questions...  
  
1\. In 150Usd account what was your leverage?  
2\. and what was the lot you started with?  
3\. When do you close your opposite trade? I was mean that you explained in your video that if we have 10k account for example and if we open 1.0 lot then we will open 0.3 lot opposite trade. We will aim for 40 pips profit and we will close that 1.0 lot but you did not mentioned when do you close opposite trade or i may have missed it...Please let me know  
4\. Do you get any signal when the condition matched or do we have to monitor the screen all time?  
  
Thank you  
  
Best Regards..

Hi Almo  
nice video...just to clarify, when selling you place 2 sells at 0.34 position size and 1 buy at 0.34 position size.  
If price goes against you and eventually a buy signal develops you close the two shorts and open 2 more buys at 0.34 and 1 sell at 0.34.  
or do you only open 1 new buy and 1 sell, because you have a buy open from earlier.

Almo thank you for this, thank you so much.  
  
Do you have a set risk % per trade that is the reason for your lot size per trade?  
  
Also you know the TP but it's not a set max SL. Looking at your historical can you suggest an emergency stop that could be put in where if not watching the charts it would alot by far most of the trades to work themselves out and work back to TP but allow the really bad trades to be closed?

Don't think so  
Sell signal---- 1 lot short and .34lot long Stop loss---- close 1 lot short add 1 lot long and .34 lot short Now he is 1.34 lot long and .34 lot short so 1/3 safety hedge is getting out of whack a bit maybe.  
EA anyone?----make quick work out of seeing if viable edge exists. Don't think there would be many signals per trading period so would take long time to test.  
Also with flash crashes becoming more prevalent any system without proper SL is asking for account draining plus house. Even with SL sometimes.

Hi  
A/ 1:100  
B/ for this specific account i used almost full leverage(i used to divide my capital to 200pips)  
C/ if my target reached for the original entry i from the start of the trade set the sl to 40+the spread of the specific pair for the insurance trade  
E/ If i see price go against me 50 pips i start to monitor and use alerts 100 pips from the entry price against me.  
  
Cheers

ok,i think you little bit confuse ..  
  
let say we got short position , i open one trade 1lot for this short but!,at the same time i open one trade 0.33 as insurance for long  
if in this case price go against me in full conditions as i mentioned what i do is like that  
  
1.close the short position but leave the long one i had from first one i had with the short signal  
2.i open new only one long trade with 1.33 lot and at the same time open as insurance trade 0.4 lot for the short position  
in this case i now have two long trades / one from the lowest price (the insurance i put from the short signal) and one from the signal price   
and have one short trade as insurance that i put from the fresh long signal.  
  
Cheers

Hi , i cant tell but as i wrote ,i set price alerts every 50 pips against me   
  
and please dont forget i just treet with this 150 usd account as an development tool as i do not suggest to trade full leverage   
  
good MM is to divide the capital at least to 2k pips and calculate before enter a trade i with this account divided always the capital to 200pips  
  
but for this case its worth it

It would be nice to have an alert when all conditions meet, because in my case it would be night hours, and a sound signal is better that to keep my eyes all night long in the charts...  
  
Anyone can develop an EA that send and alert if all CCI filters meet inside a time zone?

Just by visually checking a couple of charts, I have to say this method is really worth looking into. Especially when everything lines up at the first match.  
But, you need lots and lots of screentime to check all the different currencies. That strategy is good for daytraders.

Hi Almo,  
  
Thank you for reply. I think you misunderstood my last question. i was mean like do we get entry signal from any indicator? or do we have to check the graphs continuously to enter the trade...it is one min chart so it will be very difficult to sit infront of screen all time...  
  
thanks

Hi Al.  
  
  
See the attachments.  
I coded it as an EA, but now only used for alerting all conditions ok.  
I put all your suggested pairs in the EA.  
So you need only one chart.  
I changed the cci indi. Made less external parameters, now only period and the limits are external.  
So the indi must be saved in the indicator folder.  
The EA in the experts folder.  
Tests need to be done.

Hi Al,  
  
I coded it as EA. But now don't bother about it.  
It should work now as indi and only gives alerts when all conditions are met.  
Later we can extend and see how far we can extend this.  
  
  
It can be if you change pair that the smiley of the ea doesn't smile anymore.  
So you have to enable him again.  
Normally i use two charts/screens, one with the EA and one with all the indi's for pair switching.

It is not important how often you fall down, but how often you get up again

Hi Dirk,  
  
Strange, i have not and others also not.  
Not clear what it is.  
This ea is not taking too much cpu power.  
Evey minute he does its calculations.  
  
Can you check the experts and journal tab for messages.

I don't know. There are no error messages. But if I put the EA in only one chart, the CPU power jumps 200k up. I really don't know. But don't worry, I just do the visual check. No Problem.

Hi,  
@Al,  
  
Question: we set tp to 40 pips. As example we start a sell trade (buy trade as contra trade), but price goes against us and we get new signal. So close the sell, add an other buy and also as sell contra trade. If due to what ever reason we will not touch TP and have more signals, we every time close trades and open new ones again. Is there a limit how long we will go on. Is it really until we hit TP, or do we close before after x signals.

I made an indicator, it can help you to see better. When you change the settings, don't forget, The first CCi (7777) have another rules, like the other four.  
  
Reduce Signals:  
  
When it is true, the indicator will display the next signal only, when the 3 CCi (777,555,1300) was "empty" in the same time.  
  
Ignore Signals:  
  
(it works only when the "Reduce Signals" is true) When it is true, the indicator will not display another signal, within the adjusted number of candles.

Hi,  
  
Just use for alerts.  
Coding EA is more work, certainly much more testing.

hi  
  
i want to make the indicator alert me for when just the first 3 CCI's line up (777,555 and 1300). I'm not bothered for the other values, how do I do this?

Hi Al,  
  
Just put the ea on a chart. It does not matter which one.  
It can even be a pair which is not one of the eight you proposed  
Also timeframe is not important  
It will give you alerts for the 8 pairs you talked before about.  
  
The EA will scan the 8 pairs, and if all conditions met it gives you an alert.  
  
So the EAwill not transfer to other charts.  
The only thing is that if you change pair in the chart with the ea then the smiley of the ea changes.  
To prevent this i have a second chart with a pair changer. See the two added pictures.  
  
Forget the 2 buttons, this is a next step for auto and manual trading.  
I also added the pair changer.  
  
Hope all it clear now.  
  
BR

The EA will scan the 8 pairs, and if all conditions met it gives you an alert. So the EAwill not transfer to other charts. The only thing is that if you change pair in the chart with the ea then the smiley of the ea changes. To prevent this i have a second chart with a pair changer. See the two added pictures. Forget...

Hi Al,  
  
I think i confused you and maybe also others, by making/calling it as an ea.  
But it now works as indi, saying he does not trade, only giving alerts if conditions are met.  
All these parameters are needed when the ea starts trading. This i'm now testing in other version.  
For giving alerts none of them is needed.  
  
Yesterday i got 3 alerts, I checked with your template and was ok.  
Tonight and up to now i got no alerts. If i check the pairs with your template also no signals.  
  
BR 

It is not important how often you fall down, but how often you get up again

> Hi, @Al, Question: we set tp to 40 pips. As example we start a sell trade (buy trade as contra trade), but price goes against us and we get new signal. So close the sell, add an other buy and also as sell contra trade. If due to what ever reason we will not touch TP and have more signals, we every time close trades and open new ones again. Is there a limit how long we will go on. Is it really until we hit TP, or do we close before after x signals. BR

the probability that it will fail twice its very rare!! if we go by the rules and the trading hours that i mentioned

Hi Al,  
  
For sure it will happen seldom.  
But if i make EA, something i have to do in the case it happens.  
I can put a limit that after 2/3 times, the cycle will stop.

Perfect, thanks.  
  
Now on every symbol chance your indicator produces an alert. Can you "fix" this? My suggestion:  
  
Declere global vars  

Inserted Code
    
    
    ...
    double a01,a02,a03,a04,a05;
    double Bar_ok;
    string DPA;
    string   previousAlert="";
    datetime previousTime;

And change the alert lines so it only alerts when i==0 and only once per bar.  

Inserted Code
    
    
    if (i<=1 && (Arrow_dn[1] !=EMPTY_VALUE  || Arrow_up[1] !=EMPTY_VALUE))
    {
     DPA = StringConcatenate(Symbol(), " at ", TimeToStr(TimeLocal())," Almo SCS");
       if (previousAlert!=DPA || previousTime!=Time[0])
       {
          previousAlert = DPA;
          previousTime  = Time[0];
           if (AlertsMessage) Alert(DPA);
           if (AlertsEmail) SendMail(StringConcatenate(Symbol(), "Almo_SCS"), DPA);
           if (AlertsSound) PlaySound("alert2.wav");
        }
    }

Hi all,  
Thanks Almo2312 for this thread.  
Can you please update to post #1 with more information about your strategy, entry to open trades, how to find SL and TP?  
I have to say thanks again for your video, BTW, I (and many other traders like me) get hard to listen, just because my English is not very good. So, please write down your strategy to post 1, and we can ask Mr.GoogleTranslate ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
Thanks in advance.

I hope it is ok now, but you need to test it. I have changed it, now only do alert when the provious bar have a signal, and don't let it run through the "while" cycle. I hope it works in this way.

hi  
  
is there a parameter i can set so that the indicator doesn't take into account the stochastic for example? I'm just experimenting around.

Your effort is much appreciated.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)  
  
For the improved indicator, do we need to make any changes to the values to the inputs? In one of the previous post:  
  
"I made an indicator, it can help you to see better. When you change the settings, don't forget, The first CCi (7777) have another rules, like the other four."  
  
Thanks

Hi Al,  
  
Would you advise to use the system for higher time frames for swing trading?

I dont know what is the problem, this is my view. Do you have enough data to calculate all the CCIs?

It is only a suggestion, when you make any changes, don't forget:  
  
the rule for the 7777 CCi is: long above 0, short below 0  
the rule for the others: long abowe the adjusted level, short below the adjusted level.  
  
The levels are in the indicator (not external parameters now). The same settings like in the original templete.

Great! Thanks for the EA. Test it soon.

Given I can only trade during the NY session, and Almo stated take only the first arrow in a given direction, I took this UJ sell successfully. I did enter the trade late, but felt given where price was at the time it was reasonable. It was the first arrow of the day for the UJ. I wasn't sure if anyone else took the trade.

Really interesting strategy, Al.  
  
Was wondering if u take 40 pips with spread? for example if spread is 3 pips then u target 37 pips.  
  
and also, why only gbp pairs? i backtested, and eur/usd got a few trades aswell.  
  
and third, why only take 1 call and 1 put trade on each pair? when one trade has won in either direction and another signal appears for the same direction then why not take it?  
  
regards,  
Carel

I modified it. I hope it works, but not shure, I can not backtest it. Could any programmer check my alert, and "fix" it when something is wrong in the code?   
  
Thanks.

Hi mate ,  
  
the reason is cause in the long run the BT show me that for a given day i need to trade only one operation per direction   
  
for the same pair , one long one short ,per one pair per day

Hi All,  
  
Changed EA into dashboard indicator.  
So put file in indicator folder/directory.  
  
First 3 colums are general info, spread, pips from open and ADR.  
If stoch values are > 90, green color, < 10 red color, else orange.  
  
CCI, you see last two closed bars in colors like template.  
I exchanged CCI colums 1 and 2, to make period ascending

Like the Dashboard.  
Got a question though. Would it be possible to put into the indicator the option of choosing the pair you want. Basically into the inputs like EURUSD;GBPUSD and so forth?  
  
Thx.

Fantastic work emonts!!!!  
  
I'm with DirkH143, please make symobls adjustable as extern input and can you please add myDigits == 1 (line ~230) because I want to test it also on Dax for example.  

Inserted Code
    
    
    if( symbolData[ww]._myDigits == 1 || symbolData[ww]._myDigits == 3 || symbolData[ww]._myDigits == 5 ) symbolData[ww]._myPoint = symbolData[ww]._myPoint * 10;

Great job you are doing here with your strategy..Keep it up buddy..I have been reading your thread for a while and your strategy looks promising..I noticed something about the dashboard..Eventhough a buy signal was for GU and GCAD was issued by the arrow , Dasboard didnt issue any buy signal..Strange..Maybe its a bug.

Great job Emonts! i am reading carefully this tread from yesterday. i like the lovely effort of the coders and i say a big thank to everybody! and obviously to **Al**.  
Today i was busy so i coudn't trad, but when i came back, i saw the long entry signal on gbpusd. the price was too hi yet, so i have waited a bit and now i am long (entered under the level of the signal).  
I noticed that nobody is trading the controtrend reduced size position, why? Anyway i have opened both.   
the orizontal blue line is the close level of the signal's candle.

Hi All,  
  
Update of dashboard.  
Found one bug.  
You must know you need software bugs to keep a good consistant relationship with your customers.  
  
Added user pairs.  
You can select for the default pairs or the own defined pairs, not both.  
Pairs must be sepearated by Comma  
  
The dashboard updates its info every minute to save cpu capacity.

Hi,  
  
The last two colums for me is not clear what to display.  
  
If I display the buy or sell signal, this is only one minute valid and you must be very quick.  
  
Other option is i show the buy or sell signal for x minutes.  
  
Or other suggestins from you.

GJ no alert or signal from dashboard..I assume dashboard must turn all Green for buy signal and all Red for sell signal...Buy arrow was issued but Dashboard didnot issue any alert for Buy..

So the spread, pfo and adr gets updated every x seconds (timerUpdateInSeconds) and stoch and cci values/colors gets updated on every new M1 bar (when the 6th second begun ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)), correct?

Hi,  
  
Yes  
  
The first three rows are just added info.  
If Pips from open > ADR probably the price will not go higher/lower.  
But this is not part of the setup / strategy.  
This basic info i use in DB's.  
  
The calculation of cci and stoch for high periods, take some cpu capacity. So update every minute.  
That is also the reason that at start of the db it takes some time before info is showed.  
  
BR 

It is not important how often you fall down, but how often you get up again

Hy,  
  
a suggestion. As long as everything lines up, either buy or sell, let the buy or sell signal green or red. As soon as the conditions change, the color should disappear. What about that?

Hi Al  
  
Let's say you enter on the first Buy signal on January 31st. It was Buy throughout January 31st.  
  
So do you exit, at the end of the day i.e. 2 hours before US Close?  
  
(or)  
  
Keep the trade like that till reverse signal comes, example: Close the buy on February 1st when you get the sell signal.  
  
Sorry if i missed this point in your thread.  
  
Thanks

Good Work. I am waiting on the USDJPY. No arrow yet today, so I am expecting one.

The EA seemed to be signaling correctly now right? By the way this looks good, just confirming... we know the simple money management to use, how much of a deal is it going to be to get someone to code a very basic but true to method EA for this do you think? If the EA signals correctly then its really the money management piece right?

I coded EA, but still in test phase. Not all logic is ok. It will take test/debug time.  
Also need to optimise the code. The calculation of the long period indi's takes a lot of cpu time.  
  
I guess it will take a few days to have a tested version.

It is not important how often you fall down, but how often you get up again

Hi Almo2313, first of all thank you for your strategy and I am wondering why you need Stochastic's when you're trading when CCI's aligned, also I noticed when all of the Stochastic's values perfectly aligned in overbought/oversold area maybe we should start looking for reversal. Maybe you already noticed that. Anyways, thank you for sharing your strategy with us!  
  
Best,

**Friends/coders, in attachment is my EA (source code). You have only chande input indicator from Joker to Almo CSC and code one long/day and one short/day and it's ready. TP in this EA is in PIPS or reversal mode. Please take a look and write, what do you think about it. I'm not a coder. In nobody can code it, I'll find some coder to do it.**

Yes, email and push messages consist symbol, timeframe, buy or sell signal and the bid/ask price.

Hi Jagg,  
  
Please see attached image. You will know what we mean. I think its indicator which gives signal on current open candle so that is the main issue and as soon as if price close below or above its changing the color. so in this case we need signal at closing candle and not open candle...

why'd you take 3 long trades on a single pair?  
  
i think it should be like this: you had 1 signal on GU long yesterday, it should've won (atleast mine did). then you ignore the second signal that came yesterday, cuz its against the rules, and today you would've taken the signal which was generated.  
  
correct me if im wrong

yup, but atleast you've also opened the counter-signal trade?  
  
and thats what i ment trading the news (maybe ignore the signals on pairs that the news affect on certain day?) - GU long and GA short; depending on the news one of them is going to TP

I adjusted the SL on the GU trade. In case it reverses I am not completely without something.

No i did not open counter trade. I know this against the rule of system but i am still learning that part because what i am thinking is...as he explain in his video that if we open 1.0 lot in sell then we need 0.33 buy but as per my experience it is very hard for me to manage opposite trade. so i thought to open 0.67 lot sell instead of opening 0.33 buy trade...even if market crash you are risking 0.67 lot so why dont i manage my own money, leverage to control the risk so only lot management i managing my own way...  
  
Sorry Almo but it will take time for me to manage risk according to the system...  
  
thanks

oh okay, i got that part wrong then, thought that it ment not to open 2 trades in the same direction on the same pair.

Hi Guys,  
  
Here come a dashboard EA.  
  

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

[![Click to Enlarge

Name: Al_DB.png
Size: 111 KB](/attachment/image/2169229/thumbnail?d=1486041088)](/attachment/image/2169229?d=1486041088)   

  
  
=============================  
First:  
=============================  
@ Al: Many thanks for sharing this simple strategy with the community, let see if it is consistently profitable in the long run ;-)  
@ Emonts: Many thanks for sharing a first Dashboard ;-) I do not want to compete with your Dashboard here, I was coding a Dashboard EA on my side and I saw that you shared a Dashboard also. I thought I would share it also instead of keeping it for me  
  
=============================  
Dashboard Settings:  
=============================  
  
Dashboard settings are really straight forward. Here is a quick description of the main functions.  
  
This Dashboard comes as an EA so please install it in your MT4 experts directory.  
  
In OOTB (Out Of the Box Settings):  
  
\- During initialisation, the Dashboard will download historical data from your broker to make sure you have enough data to have the correct calculations. If you are using a fresh MT4 installation, it might take a little bite of time the first time you launch the Dashboard.  
  
\- You can place the Dashboard on any timeframe as the settings for the timeframes used for calculation are coded in the EA (inside EA settings).  
  
\- This Dashboard EA can be used as a Dashboard only which generates signals or as an EA as well. In OOTB settings EA mode is turned off.  
  
\- You can changes the list of pairs to display the 28 standards, for this first version I have hardcoded the list of pairs suggested by Al.  
  
\- in the floating results panel, when trades are open you will notice small red crosses, a click on it would close the open orders.  
  
\- In the info panel the dashboard displays:  
The current spread (in Orange if it is higher than the average spread)  
The average Spread  
Today ADR (in Orange if it is higher than the average ADR)  
The average ADR  
  
You have various alert modes available in the Dashboard.  
  
A click on the pair label or on the signal square (when there is a signal) will open the chart of the selected pair, you can specify the template in the DB settings. I am using Al template as default, if you want the template to be opened correctly make sure to install al Indis from post 1.  
  
Dashboard is movable anywhere on your screen.  
01 - Click to select the dashboard (a little square will appear in the top left corner)  
02 - Let shift keyboard button pressed and left mouse clicked and drag and drop the DB where you want.  
03 Unselect the dashboard to make sure display is correct  
  
If you are displaying the 28 standards pairs you have an option to display separators lines to make the informations more visible.  
  
The file comes as a compiled file as I am using some helpers (mqh) to code.  
  
=============================  
EA Settings and filters:  
=============================  
  
You can filter trades with trading hours, settings are really straight forward. Time filter is using LOCAL HOURS (I can see the questions coming already) as specified in settings.  
  
You can also filter trades per sessions.  
The dashboard is using an automatic GMT offset calculation, no need to change sessions time. The DB is using windows OS to get those values, tested on W10 and on my VPS running W server 2012.  
Open sessions are highlighted in colors below the dashboard. You can specify which currency are tradable during each session.  
  
I tried to keep the EA settings as simple as possible, using Al suggestions and trade management, however I have added a couple of options (possibility to place SL and TP with trades, options to use a second leg trade as Al is doing).  
  
In OOTB settings:  
\- all individual SL and TP are on off.  
\- Fixed MM is used First leg with 0.1 lot and second leg with 0.03 lot.  
\- Both legs will be closed if leg 1 reach 40 pips.  
\- Opposite orders will be opened if the dashboard generates an opposite signal.  
\- Spread filter is on (if current spread is higher than average spread the trade is not open), only applicable for the first initial trade to open.  
\- ADR filter is off (if on and today ADR > average ADR or distance between Today ADR and average ADR < inputs in EA settings the trade is not open), only applicable for the first initial trade to open.  
  
Trade are open when a signal is generated on last closed candle. There is an option to use the current open candle instead.  
  
I have not fully tested the trade management so be careful and test it  
  
Working perfectly on MT4 build 1031, windows 10, coded with editor 1498.  
Dashboard tested on TradersWay which has a suffix i and working fine.  
  
Thats it, there might be a few glitches here or there do not hesitate to report them ;-)  
  
=============================  
Additional info:  
=============================  
I have coded the DB as emonts, please note that the first CCI on the Dashboard is the one with the Slowest period (555) when on Al templated the first one (the upper one) is the period 777.  
  
40 pips as TP sounds good for pairs suggested by Al. For other pairs with a lower ADR the TP might have to be lower.  
  
Have fun,  
G

I think its indicator which gives signal on current open candle so that is the main issue and as soon as if price close below or above its changing the color. so in this case we need signal at closing candle and not open candle...

Ok, here is my modified version. I name it Almo_CSC_with_Alert_v1.00**j**.mq4(j for jagg **![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)**)  
  
* I've added a new setting to **reduce cpu usage** (see picture).  
* I've changed the indicator to look for a **signal at bar -1 (not the actual bar which is forming)**. So it shouldn't be any arrow on that bar which still is forming.  
* There is **only one arrow** shown in the chart **for one direction**. So when we have a buy arrow this buy arrow will be the only buy arrow until we have a counter entry signal (sell arrow).  
  
Please test it!

As I was writing my previous post, I just had 3 closed trades in profit and 3 new trades opened as displayed in the pic below.  
  
In the next update, I will include an option to avoid opening new trades once we had a profitable trade on a pair, I think it would make sense.  
  
The pips results are also showing a negative value as it sums up the pips of the buy and sell order considering the spread. In the next update, I might teak that to show only the pip count of the trade in trend direction.  
  
This first test shows that the TP option is working fine in the DB.  
  
Next step is to test the opposite trades mode when we have an opposite signal.  
  
I think it make sense to set trading hours from Frankfurt till 1 hour before London close also. Or maybe to let trading on 24/24 and use the session filter per currency as suggested by Al.  
  
More stats needed…

Thanks for developing this dashboard EA. Better to trade it with this and semi automatic trade. Thanks a lots.

Your welcome ;-)  
  
  
Ok, here is a quick update with an option turned on in OOTB settings which stop opening new trades on a pair once pair cash result is in profit for the day..

OOTB means default settings when you launch the DB.  
  
If you want to turn on autotrading to use the DB as an EA just turn on this option:

Here is a last DB update for today (if no glitch till there) showing the pip count for floating result of the trade in trend only.

Thank you @gringoh.  
1\. First problem is with open a trade after a signal. EA must open trade only exactly on arrow (ALMO CSC indi). Now, when I open mt4 30 min after a signal, and conditions are still god - EA trades (it's too late). It must trade only when signal occures (no later).  
2\. Trades per day \- Only one long trade per day (it doesn't matter profitable or not), and one short trade per day (it doesn't matter profitable or not).  
  
If you change it, we can test it.  
  
**Once again thank you for magnificient work!**

@ Emonts: thanks ;-)  
  
@ Strom :  
  
1: DB open trades on fresh new signals only. I am not using the arrow here to monitor setup, I am using Al indis from post 1. Please note that on the DB, fresh new signals appears on Red or Lime colours and when conditions are still valid on following bars they appear in Teal or Pink.  
  
2: Ok I have coded this option in this new update. Option on false in OOTB settings.

Sorry but no, MT4 strategy tester does not handle multiple pairs backtest !!! And even with only 1 pair in the DB, with the way it is coded, I don’t think the tester will handle it.  
  
I am currently forward testing it here ;-)  
  
As stated in one of my previous post:  
  
\- The stealth TP function at + 40 pips is working fine  
\- The opposite signal function: I am still monitoring some open trades to see if we have such a potential condition  
  
Here my current situation (some trades were re-open even if I had profitable trades already, that was before the addition of the latest options to allow only 1 buy/sell per day).

@ Strom: thanks  
@ Al: Results are reported according to the EA Magic Number, if you want to see results of manual trades (without Magic Numbers) you have to input 0 in EA settings. Please also make sure to switch Off autotrading to make sure that the EA do not manage some trades opened manually (to avoid potential issues).  
  
One additional note:  
  
At the moment when trade are open comments are:  
Gig-In Trend Buy (for the in trend trade Leg 1)  
GiG-CTT Sell (for the CTT trade Leg 2)  
  
If opposite trades are open  
GiG-Opposite Buy  
GiG-Opposite Sell  
  
I am considering changing those comments for:  
  
GiG-L1-In Trend Buy  
GiG-L2-CTT Sell  
  
And  
GiG-L1-Opposite Buy  
GiG-L2-Opposite Sell  
  
What do you think guys?

1\. Can we add some option to close each trade on Dash? Now we can close only all tardes.  
2\. Can we add some option turn off each pair on Dash? For ex. adr is very low and I don't won't to trade.  
3\. I'm thinking about different TP and SL for each.  
  
Guys, what do you think about it?

Hi mate the indicator show only the first sell or buy and not for the given day

@ Strom : Everything is possible but as I stated I tried to keep this Dashboard as simple as possible and to code only Al rules.  
  
I have coded some much more complex Dashboard with a lot of options but at the end when there are too many options it is almost always a failure.  
  
The best way to go from my point of view is to have a Dashboard EA like this one and to use it semi manually. You let the Dashboard open the trade for you (at least if you are not in front of the computer when there is a signal the Dashboard open the trade for you). And then when you are in front of the screen, if you are not comfortable with the trade you can decide to close it manually.  
  
1: In the DB you have a red cross (at the bottom) which allow to close ALL trades, and when some trades are open, on the left of the floating results, some red crosses will appear also, and allow you to close only the pairs trades (please check my previous screenshots you will see them).  
  
2: For the time being I wont code any ADR filter (excepted the one already coded). Best thing is to add or remove pairs from the Dashboard list of pairs. Lets play with this tools first, and once we have some stats we can discuss a potential additional ADR filter.  
  
3: To go further with the ADR filter, we can also imagine a TP according to the pair ADR (the current TP of 40 pips is around 1/3 to the ADR of GBP pairs), so we can imagine to have a dynamic TP of the pairs ADR. But thats for later once we have stats ;-) For SL I have no view at the moment, we only have the opposite signal in the DB at the moment.

The best way to go from my point of view is to have a Dashboard EA like this one and to use it semi manually. You let the Dashboard open the trade for you (at least if you are not in front of the computer when there is a signal the Dashboard open the trade for you). And then when...

You're right @Gringoh. Let's start testing this method first. Thx for your answer.

It might be a good idea to use it as a Dynamic Take Profit, lets discuss that tomorrow ;-)

you get many many alerts on one bar with Almo_CSC_with_Alert_v1.01j.mq4? Can't believe that ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)  
  
I did a test for you (with modified indicator so I get an alert) and it worked as it should.  
All alerts in settings activated, I got  
* **one** alert window in MT4  
* **one** alert as email (gmail)  
* **one** alert as push on my android phone  
  
So which alert(s) you get many times (and which alert(s) you set to true in indicator settings)?

Great idea, with those feature we can maximize pips gain. 

Risk comes from not knowing what you're doing.

Hi Guys,  
  
Here is an update for today. I have fixed a glitch and added the Dynamic ADR TP. Now I think we have a good candidate for a week test starting next week. I am going to set 2 DB on my VPS, 1 to test the pairs recommended by Al with a fix TP of 40 pips, and a second test with the 28 standard pairs with a Dynamic TP of 25 % the average ADR.  
  
================================  
Fixed Glitch  
================================  
Yesterday when I have updated the DB to limit trades to 1 buy in Trend and 1 sell in Trend I have forgotten that when you open a trade according to Al rules you were opening a buy and a sell at the same time, so trading would have been limited to 1 trade in Trend only. Now this version fix this issue and trading is limited to 1 buy and 1 sell in trend with their CTT leg.  
  
================================  
Dynamic ADR  
================================  
As discussed yesterday, I have included a Dynamic ADR TP. This option can be useful to test how the DB performs with the 28 standard pairs. In OOTB setting the % is set at 25 % the average ADR value which is, from my point of view, roughly the TP that Al is using for the recommended pairs. I have also included a minimal and maximal value for this Dynamic ADR TP in order to avoid abnormal value when there is an abnormally low or high average ADR (which occurs from time to time). There is also an option to display those Dynamic ADR TP value on the right side of the DB (as in my previous pic). On default this option is on false to avoid cluttering the DB. You can also see this value if you hover your mouse over the various average ADR values.

================================  
Session filter  
================================  
Here is a quick note for guys who want to test the session currency filter. The dashboard is using an automatic GMT offset calculation to see which sessions are open or not. Based on that some pairs are allowed for trading or not. In the screenshot below, you can note that only London session is open (Green color). In the DB settings, you can note that during London session only EUR, CHF and GBP currencies are allowed for trading (you can note that those currencies are in Green below sessions time on the DB). The result would be that only pairs which have one of those currencies in the base or quote would be allowed for trading.  
  
Those settings in the DB are the most common ones which make sense. However, from my point of view this session currency filter would be more useful during Asia session than during London and NY sessions, which mean you would probably want to allow all currencies for trading during London and NY sessions.

================================  
Technical note  
================================  
In the dashboard, the signals are checked this way:  
  
If the previous closed bar has a signal and the bar before do not have a signal, then this is a valid signal and it is highlighted in Red or Lime on the DB.  
  
If the previous closed bar has a signal and the bar before has a signal, then this is a continuation signal (not a valid signal to enter a trade) and it is highlighted in Teal or Pink.  
  
The dashboard is not checking for the first signal of the day (for CPU issue). If your dashboard is running 24/24 a day, as the dashboard is limiting trading to 1 in trend buy and 1 in trend sell a day only the first valid signals would trigger a trade. It also means that if your guys are launching the DB in the middle of the day the DB might trigger a trade with a signal which is not the first signal of the day.  
  
Hope it make sense.  
  
Only 1 DB option was not tested yet as I didnt had a setup to test it yet, the opposite signal trade.  
  
================================  
Additional filter  
================================  
As I said above I think this DB is ready for a forward test. I dont plan to add any other options for the moment as we have already all Als rules coded and even more.  
  
From my experience, all Dashboards monster with tons of options are always failure, so lets try to keep it simple.  
  
Off course we are people with an open mind here and any suggestions are welcome, and off course if Al has other ideas I will update the DB ;-)  
  
================================  
My settings for my test  
================================  
You can also find attached in this post my 2 sets files.  
  
1st set file: Pairs recommended by Al with a fix TP of 40 pips.  
2nd set file: 28 standard pairs with a Dynamic TP of 25 % the average ADR.  
  
I am also using a time filter from "+8.00,-17.00" (my local time) which is from Frankfurt open until London Close.  
  
PS: you can note that there is a small clock at the bottom of the dashboard below the Pairs labels, if the clock is green trading time is on, if the clock is red trading time is off.  
  
Cheers,  
G

Gringoh  
First thanks for coding an EA for this strategy ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1). Got a couple of questions after viewing two times Almo's video.  
  
\- " Stealth Take Profit" : When triggered, will this close both the Leg1 Trend order AND the Leg2 countertrend insurance order ?  
  
\- "Close and Open new Orders on Opposite Signal" : Will this close both trend(main) and countertrend(insurance) orders ? My understanding is to let the countertrend order opened when having an opposite signal, while closing only the main order.  
If it's not the case currently, maybe you should deal with dual magicnumbers (one per leg) ?

@ corsican :  
  
\- Yep stealth TP close both legs trades.  
  
\- Opposite signal should (example for a in Trend buy with an opposite signal)  
  
==> close the BUY initial Leg 1 in trend order  
==> let the SELL initial Leg 2 CTT order open  
==> Open a Leg 1 SELL order  
==> Open a Leg 2 CTT buy order  
  
The DB should work as intended by I didn’t had such a setup yet to test it. I will report once I have a confirmation.

Ok, I launched a DB with set file 2 yesterday evening to test the 28 standards pairs (preliminary test) and to potentially have and test a setup with an opposite signal.

Results are not that good on DB but hey we are Friday, let see on the long run ;-)  
  
I just had an opposite signal on NZDCAD. A sell trend trade was open just after London Open and was cancelled by an opposite buy signal a few minutes ago:

The logic is working fine, there was just a glitch as I made a dirty copy/paste in the code with the wrong lot size to open the Opposite L1 order (the L2 lot size was used).  
  
Here the updated DB.

Carel,  
  
This suggestion of not trading, is it identifying pairs that have news items scheduled? (or) not trading even after the news is out?

Maybe according to the news? And yes, it would identify the pairs.  
  
I like the 25% adr idea too!

Hi GRINGOH  
  
Tks for your work.  
  
I will take a look on this EA during next weekend.  
  
Is it possible to include parameter do trade also manually... I mean send the signal alert and trader analyze the scenario before push the buy or sell button.  
  
Tks..

Almo, which lotsize did you use (for the initial signal order), per slice of 100USD available capital in the balance ?  
You used 0.03 at first when you had initially 150USD ?   
I want to understand how you compounded with 1:100 live leverage, while trading the 8 pairs simultaneously.  
To use easy round numbers perspective, what initial lotsize would you use for a 1000USD starting capital ? or Once you reached it ?  
  
And congratz.. Going from 150 USD to +4000USD in a month is just amazing.

Almo, does a gap down or gap up signal count as valid for you? Ie the signal I got today on market open for GBP/CHF was due to the gap down over the weekend. But does that count as a signal for you?

Hehe, newbie mistake, in my previous set files I have forgotten to turn on the option “Use Dashboard as EA ?” on true, so the DB was not taking any trades.  
  
I turn on the option 2 hours after London Open and here my results for the moment:

UJ hit TP...GU missed by 1 or 2 pip and GC and UC still running. UC gave buy signal but i was sleeping and GC is not given buy signal yet...I have UC because H4 200 MA saying some good story. I am waiting for it to break 200MA. It is rejected at the moment and working as a strong resistance so waiting for it to break. If i was awake at mid night then definitely i had closed it and opened up buy because i can see clearly that it had hit the tp and could have covered the loss...but now i have to wait to recover or to take more loss if it break the 200MA...  
  
wait and watch...

Hey,  
  
I have the latetest Version of the EA. The EA opened 1 trade one the gbpusd and gpbjpy. It hit TP on both and then opened another trade on the next Signal. I enabled the only trade 1 profitable trade and the 1 buy and 1 sell. But this time it opened 2 times for sell and it supposed to open only once in one direction once a day. Do you know whats wrong?  
  
D.  
PS: does Opposite Signal has anything to do with it?

Trade limitation is only for initial signals.  
  
Opposite trades mode is a different story it open an opposite trade when a trade is already open and you have an opposite signal.  
  
There is no limitation in number of trades for this one for the moment as you shouldn't have more than 2 opposite signal a day.

So, if I turn of the Opposite trade, than the EA does 1 trade buy and 1 trade sell, if they appear? Am I right?  
  
Thx.

Nice trade, are you trading only in london session? 

Risk comes from not knowing what you're doing.

I am using the preset files sent a few post above nothing more (only one modification to make in them, just make sure to turn on true use DB as EA).  
  
Trading time is from Frankfurt open to London close (when Al is using 2am > 10pm GMT+2).  
  
Hope it helps ;-)

Finally our Sell trade on GBPCAD was closed by an opposite trade. This opposite trade BUY was closed in profit really quickly.  
  
Now there are 2 other GBP trades which are the main contributors to the current DD.  
  
A few notes for later:  
=======================  
\- In the floating results I changed the open pips counts calculation to display only the in trend pips. For Closed results the pips count look messy I might change it for number of winning trades/Loosing trades? What do you think?  
  
\- As we are not using any SL and not any recovery management for opposite trades, a few loosers can kill our profit in no time. That is the main issue with the current strategy from my point of view. The CTT leg help to compensate a little bite the loosing trade but that might not be enough. Just thinking loudly... ideas are welcome....

What happens to your trades when the EA is offline? For example when a trade is in DD, opposite signal appears outside of london hours, will the EA recognize the signal that has been generated and automatically close the DD trade and open a new one?  
  
I might have some ideas for exits, CCI or RSI. Gotta test them out when i get home.

When the EA is offline (if your MT4 platform is not connected): then nothing happen.  
  
Concerning the trading time filter, it is applicable only for the initial trade, for opposite signals, they can be triggered any time (that's how it works at the moment).

Update: Now GBPAUD is the main contributor to the DD, the situation is realy different with a few loosers!  
  
Considering my time filter setting's which are different from Al's, my GA Sell trade was trigger after LO when Al one was trigger earlier and was closed in profit... I will keep those settings for this week to have some consistent stats, but I will consider changing time filter like according to Al's. Thanks Al ;-)

Yep, saw that too. Wouldnt it be possible for the ea to recoqnize which signal it is, is it initial, or is it 2nd (like today) or 3rd?

what if we would use exit signal from CCI Filter 777, when it crosses OB/OS it would close the open trades for the currency pair accordingly?  
  
or, maybe use this rsi (attachment) as exit. it can be used as a higher timeframe rsi.  
for example, in 1m chart if the period is 14, and multiplier 15 it means its the same as the normal rsi period 14 on 15min timeframe  
OB: 70  
OS: 30  
  
also, would it be possible to add alerts to this indicator? when rsi crosses either OB/OS it would alert, thx!

Hey guys  
  
First and foremost a great big thanks to Almo and Gringoh for their amazing work on this project as well as all the others who have contributed including emonts and jagg  
  
Just thought i'd share my results so far with the default settings with one change, my tp is 20 pips as you can see, with a stop loss of 30. not a good ratio according to most i know, but the results speak for themself  
  
I'm gutted i cant show todays results as it was looking rather spectacular at about 23%! I then refreshed a setting and todays results are nowhere to be seen...lol  
  
I've played around with this project quite a bit so far, excluding certain CCI's, using different time frames and thus far found the dafault settings and timeframe of 1m the best.  
  
I'm certainly finding the CHF pairs quite an annoyance but i would like to see this week out before removing any pairs  
  
My only concern is the NEWS. The only thing this wicked machine lacks in my opinion is an easy filter to filter those pairs that are going to be affected by news. if this could be added in future, would be a great help!  
  
Anyways, I'll keep you guys updated.

why not 1:1 RR 20:20? it would work if the system has around 60% winrate, amiright? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
and yes, i support the news option  
  
also, would it be possible for the ea to include settings like "risk x amount money" and or "risk x%"

Here is a quick DB and results update:  
  
=========================  
Modifications  
=========================  
\- Now, the pip count for all displayed results is showing only the L1 orders pip count (the previous DB was showing the net of both legs orders and was a bite messy). The total is displayed also.  
  
\- I have also included an additional information to show a Win/Loss counter per pair and for the total.  
  
\- I have included some buttons just after the pairs label. Green = trading on, red off for Buy/Sell. On init there are turned ON by default, you can switch all buttons status with the 2 buttons at the bottom. Those buttons are filtering only the initial trades as the other filters.  
  
PS: Buttons not tested yet but should work as intended as I have already used those filters in other DB.  
  
=========================  
Note  
=========================  
I wont include any news filter in the DB. I did that in the past and it is always a nightmare as you rely on website informations and formatting and for any reason if something change the function wont work anymore.  
  
You have various functions which can help you to avoid trading during news: Trading hour filter, Session filter, now the buttons to allow buy or sell.  
  
=========================  
Results update  
=========================

Ok, here is a new version of the indicator _(Almo_CSC_with_Alert_v1.0**2** j.mq4)_  
  
***added*** Show ADR value(s) on a corner of your choice  
***added*** Show trade history - this shows if past arrows were winners or loosers (according to your set tp/sl)  
(green line from entry to tp if it was a winner, red line from entry to sl if it was a looser - or a line from entry to next arrow if neither tp or sl reached)  
***added*** Show TP/SL line(s) on an active signal (this is for information only - no trade is executed if it's reached)  
  
_Please test it on a live market. I didn't had any new signal so "show tp/sl lines" is untested if it works as designed._  
  
**I've added also my used template. I added buttons for easy symbol change (with Almos default pairs) and replaced the pivot indicator.**

Many thanks for this indi Jagg ;-)  
  
Now that almost all the rules are coded into your indi, what about making a quick stats calculation to get a proxi of results?  
  
A basic approach could be enough with let say a pip value of 1 for leg 1 and 0.3 for leg 2.  
  
For the moment, I think that the only thing which is not managed by your indi for this calculation is the opposite trade rule? (with Al rules we should also remove the SL).  
  
Just an idea… Thanks again ;-)

If you are using my DB it is probably when you launch the EA.  
  
When you launch it the DB tries to download historical data which might not be available on your borker.  
  
You can try to download those data manually.

Everything seems ok, did you had a signal already (popup message?). I don't see any valid signal on your screenshot above.

No pop up signal and no trades but the previous version of EA keeps opening orders unlike the new version of EA..

Hello,  
  
I have noticed that already when trades are lining up, some go wrong. I think it has to do with the CCI 7777 setting. If you check the history and you only take the first signal after the CCI 7777 changed than the chances of a good trade increase. If the EA takes signals after that first Signal, the likelyhood for a win is not that great. Just do a visual check, you will see.  
  
@ gringoh. Would it be possible for the EA to only trade the first Signal after the CCI 7777 changed and ignore all the signals that come after until the CCI 7777 changes again?  
  
Thx.  
D.

the ea took two buy trades on GJ, but why? considering the first one was winning, and the second one lost. i'm testing 15:20 pips RR.  
yes, i have the setting limit trades to 1 buy and 1 sell trade a day  
  
al's strategy also gave another signal as well on EJ, which wouldve been a winning trade, but the ea didn't take this trade?  
i think there are a few more, but i didnt check all the pairs

Many thanks to Forexpinbar, bradipo and packgreen49 for your responses. I do however have another query and that is if there are outstanding open trades before the market(s) you are in close, do you close these trades regardless whether they are in profit or not

Hi guys,  
  
Just a quick clarification.  
  
I cannot and won’t reply to messages saying the EA is doing this or that when it should do this or that if your guys are not giving me more information’s.  
  
If you want me to reply, please post:  
  
\- A screenshot of the DB EA  
\- A screenshot of the EA settings tab with concerned settings  
\- Potentially a screenshot of you Terminal’s Experts tabs if needed (if any weird notification)  
\- Potentially a screenshot of the Terminal’s Account history with trades concerned  
\- Potentially a screenshot of trades with Al’s template  
  
I cannot read in your mind nor on your MT4 platform, believe if I could I would…  
  
Do not take it personally, I am not targeting anybody.  
  
At the same time, here is a results update:

Hi Forexpinbar,  
  
Just having a look at your screenshots, on your second screenshot, I can see values in the CCI n°5 when on your first screenshot I cannot see any values.  
  
Have you changed any CCI settings?

If you check the history and you only take the first signal after the CCI 7777 changed than the chances of a good trade increase. If the EA takes signals after that first Signal, the likelyhood for a win is not that great. Just do a visual check, you will see. @ gringoh. Would it be possible for the EA to only trade the first Signal after the CCI 7777 changed and ignore all the signals that come after until the CCI 7777 changes...

I never had a situation with 2 buy trades or 2 sell trades the same day on 1 pair.

In the temporary DB version I sent you, you should have CCI values printed in the expert tab like in the pic below.  
  
The idea is to check that you have a correct value for CCI 5 as I do not see any values in your DB various screenshots:

Hi gringoh, I wish you could share your setfile, these question would be silenced and we focus on the testing.  
  
My EA has not taken any trade since the last modification of the ea?

alright, here are my settings and sc of db.  
now that i think of it it might be the "limit trading to one profitable trade per day?" setting, as i have selected "false" instead of "true", but it should still work cuz limit trading to 1 buy and 1 sell is "true"  
  
and when the "limit trading to one profitable trade per day?" is on "true" i get 1 to no trades. does it apply to all pairs or each one individually?

to see the value one has to go to the chart by clicking on eur/usd for example and manually scroll enough data for mt4 to calculate cci 5 value. it worked for me: image below.  
  
also some stats got lost

No idea I haven't change any thing in the logic in the latest version excepted trading buttons and more infos to report winning//loosing trades.  
  
I will check the code this week-end.  
  
From my point of view it is due to historical data with brokers, when there is not enough history to calculate CCI 5.  
  
To get signals, CCI 5 must have a value...

for me it seems to sometimes open new buy/sell when one of CCI's turn green/red again.  
  
Almo still monitoring this thread? any ideas? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
just a random idea, what if we switch signals, buy into sell and vice versa. i wouldve be now quite a few % up instead of dd. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1) atleast with 1:1 rr like 20 to 20 pips

i think it has similarities with CCI Filter 1300.  
  
but for what i understand is, if 555, 1333 have crossed level 155, 2333 has crossed 0 and 200MA above 365MA - then the indicator shows green, vice versa for red/purple/pink

Hy guys,  
  
Please don't take this the wrong way but should'nt we focus on the original strategy and get that to work as best as possible before adding and adding new stuff. That is in my experience the first step such a thread gets lost in itself. First Focus on getting a consistent Profit, than try to improve it. This testing will still take longer to get it run profitable.

i think that it also depends on the current market situation, is it trending or ranging  
i believe Almo achieved the results in a mainly trending market, correct me if i'm wrong

Maybe before trading, we should determine the trend, using a higher timeframe, and than disable the buy/sell so that it can only open in the trend direction.  
What about that?

yeah you could manually see for yourself it for yourself for example if a pair is in a narrow range on H4 chart then disable the pair until it moves out of the range, but that would be jumping ahead of Almo's original strategy again. I want to wait and see when gringoh adds the reversal indicator to the DB and it if it has any effect on results ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

i got to watch the video for a bit before it went private, so here is my explanation:  
  
on GBPAUD we would enter normally like the system says with the blue arrow, unfortunately the price reverses and starts going lower. now comes the reverse trade (green line on the chart), we would close the initial position with around 65 loss, and open new trade in new direction.  
  
IF we wait for the normal reverse signal, the loss would be 130 pips (red line and arrow represents the old reverse trade)

Thanks for the explanation, do you have the indications about this new signal (the detailled calculation), it would help to code it into the DB EA.

Hi Gringoh, I believe the idea of the AlmoCC1 2 indicator is from this thread [http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...=631956&page=8](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=631956&page=8) . This is where the idea for this thread started. hope it helps

i, unfortunately dont have any exact calculations about this reverse signal indicator, however i do have a hunch of how it works  
  
BUY SIGNAL:  
CCI 555 > 155  
CCI 1333 > 155  
CCI 2333 > 0  
EMA200 **ABOVE** EMA365  
  
SELL SIGNAL:  
CCI 555 < 155  
CCI 1333 < 155  
CCI 2333 < 0  
EMA200 **BELOW** EMA365  
  
  
BUT this indicator can also give false signals, see images below  
from YELLOW(original entry) to RED(new reverse signal) is about 32 pips  
from RED(new reverse entry) to GREEN(original reverse signal) is about 40 pips  
so in total it would generate a 72 pip DD, not sure how frequent this is tho, hopefully not very frequent ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Hi G  
  
something wrong with the last two version of the cci arrow indicators , they give sometimes signals that not match the real entry conditions ,  
  
  
did somebody else notice that?  
  
Cheers  
  
Al. 

Dream, believe,fight for it and you will achieve and NEVER EVER GIVE UP!

youve got to add trading hours, in the second last picture. currently you would be trading only on saturday, but markets are closed then.  
  
copy this: +2.00,-23.59 and add it to sunday-friday trading hours  
  
also, i suggest you trade only the 8 recommended pairs, less risk

Almo's strategy seems to work well if you trade only the pairs he recommended..Here are results for today since London open..So far so good.Thanks to gringoh for creating a beautiful EA to trade this strategy..Green pips to you all...

Why trade all 28 pairs when Almo has already recommended EURGBP,GBPAUD,GBPCAD,GBPCHF,GBPJPY,GBPUSD,USDCAD,USDJPY ? We are only going to lose if we trade other pairs other than the ones recommended by ALMO..This is where discipline in trading comes in...Most traders fail because they are not disciplined , myself not excluded..Still working on my discipline though and I hope to become as disciplined as a robot..Green pips all.

Hi fellow traders.  
I was interested in this simple strategy which seemed to be powerfull and developed EA by Almo CSC rules in order to back test it and maybe use in trading. Unfortunately almost all currency pairs showed losing results in back-tests. Back-tests were run:

  1. In Open prices model as EA operates with M1 bar open prices. This method reduces testing time while the results are the same comparing with all ticks method.
  2. Using deep 2+ years M1 history to get more deals under different market conditions.
  3. Default EA setting match Almo CSC basic strategy rules although you may change EA inputs and try to get better results.

Sorry but at the moment I do not see any market advantage in this strategy.  
You may download back-test results and EA, run back-taest yourself and compare with mine.  
EA doesn't need any external indicator or anything else to work in MT terminal/tester.  
In oreder to be sure that EA back-tests are true you may run it 1 week on demo account and then run the same period in MT4 tester back-test and comare results. They match 99%.  
To be honest this strategy realy showed good results in January 2017 according to back-tests that is why Almo's gain is likly caused by luck but I can not see any winning agde in long term.  
Hope to prevent you from wasting time and maybe money. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
Take care and stay green.

Interesting results, thanks!  
  
But do you have Trade1 and Trade2 in your EA (e.g. for a buy 0.10 lot long + 0.3 lot short and so on?! Only one trade per day or max 2 when we reach counter signal and so on ....)   
  
_17kb for that (your EA) looks really small for me_

he did not use counter-leg-trade, so the results above are not valid  
also, manually switching off the feature to trade certain pair decreases DD, for example news time.  
we just have to wait for gringoh to get that reverse signal to the DB

Yes EA places **one trade per day**. Opposite trade may be opened at the same day if it is allowed by EA settings.  
My EA do not have "**insurence opposite order** " according to Almo original strategy as it doesn't bring any trading advantage. Say you open Buy 1.0 lot and Sell 0.3 lot at the same time. And having reversal signal you close the main order 1.0 lot and remain "insurance" 0.3 order. This point is absolutely equal that you have opened Buy 0.7 from the very begining and closed it at the checkpoint. You may open or not reversal order at this checkpoint but it doesn't cause much difference in average performance. You may test it yourself as EA has 3 differen types of close opportinities of losing trade:

  1. Close losing trade according to SL,
  2. Close losing trade according to opposite singal without opening reversal order,
  3. Close losing trade according to opposite singal with opening reversal order,

"Insurance" 0.3 lot reverse order causes loss only:

  1. Increasing spread loss for opening & closing 0.3 lot.
  2. Increasing swap loss in case trade lasting more than 1 day.

It is as simple as arithmetic: **1.0 - 0.3 = 0.7**

It is realy funy to read. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
Imho code must be as short as possible while controlling all necessary trading events and executing orders. The strategy is too simple so there is no need to complicate algorithm and code. You may check yourself if EA obey the rules. I've alredy checked myself. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Congratulations mate! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
But what is the magic in converting my losing results into your winning? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
Is it the same EA? Are there the same default settings? Would you ming to attach the whole html detailed statement to compare as I did?

Yes, but this "insurence opposite order" isn't closed at counter signal. So when counter signal goes into profit you have 1.3 lot winning (and 0.3 from this 1.3 from the initial buy order price). But Almo should answer that....

Dear M.r sevan!,  
This EA is far away from my strategy! also on the sl on reverse there is bug!check it out very good before u insolte someone that gave from his time to strange peoples!.  
I suggest you to back test like the oldies and after that  
Talk to me..,and for the rest traders,trade the pairs i told  
Trade the hours i told,trade like i gave the exmples on the revers and to put 2 orders at the start of the trade,also i gave an optional reverse indicator that decrease the DD.  
Use it only after first signal failed and only for reverse.  
And as i told b4 ,the probability trade will faill twice is very rare,also u can check it via M.r S EA,in the con loose section its 1!.  
Cheers.

Once again the pair GBPCAD has los teavily, i have blocked it today. anyway the EA has recovered the loss, and that Gringoh'S DB is extraordinary, i like it.   
the gain percentage is not important at the moment cause i am using low leverage, <1%; maybe next week i will try leverage 2. What matter is the rapport W/L and relative pips gained.

Gringoh, where are you?

Hi Guys,  
  
I was busy with personal work and so I didn’t have much time to work on the DB EA so far, but a major update is coming in a few minutes.  
  
I can see that some of you have some great results.  
  
And I can see that some of you still do not have signals with the latest DB EA version available in this thread (due to CCI 5 which do not have values). Initially, I thought it was due to historical data missing but there might be another reason. I had some issues with some of my tools with MT Crap latest build (1045) which was buggy. I had to force the update to the latest BETA build 1049 and it seems that those issues are fixed now (my other tools which were not working anymore with build 1045 are now working fine again as they always were). I give more explanations to update to beta build 1049 here: [http://www.greed-is-good.com/forum/v...php?p=540#p540](http://www.greed-is-good.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=540#p540)  
  
As you have probably already noted, Al has decided to close this thread for non-activity reason (post 1).  
  
Considering the new features in the next DB EA update I will open a new thread for it. That’s what not my plan to open a thread for it, but you will understand why when you will see it.  
  
The new DB EA will come in a few minutes, the time to prepare the wording for it, stay tuned, I will post a link in this thread once ready.  
  
Cheers,  
G

i never said you needed to do anything, i was merely asking if you were gonna put up a trade explorer not for measuring dicks but the profitability of your system.  
I wonder why everytime a trade explorer is mentionned people suddenly get aggressive.

Here are my 2 weeks results using the DB (no modifications in my previous presets shared here):  
  
\- 8 pairs, Frankfurt open to London close, 40 pips TP, 2 legs, Opposite trades on

The results are not amazing, but it is not a disater. The win rate are not bad at all (67% and 74%), if we manage to limit the losses we might have something here.  
  
That's the reason why I have coded the DB EA update ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)
