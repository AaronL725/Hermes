**The original thread<http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=165948>**  
**Grew to a size that made it very difficult for new people to gain an insight into the original system.**  
  
**Below is the 1st post on this new thread and will list the original indicators that are used now. Any repainting indictors will not be posted as they created many questions which already in the thread has been answered many times  
  
This system can used on any time frame**  
**I like using it on the 5min and 1min but also have it set up on the daily and hhour I personaly also use it on a daily time frame..**  
  
**I use it primarily on EURUSD this was added 27th July 1020 and hence the change in the Thread title.**  
  
**A few brief lines on the history,**  
  
**I found and used a combination of 2 indicators BB MACD and Trend Magic ( TM).BBMACD was used for gauging of the trend i.e. up or down and the TM was used for entry and stop loss**  
  
**The BBMCD and the TM were then combined into 1 indicator called the HA_0001a this indicator would give a green bar when a BBMACD and TM long signal was present and a red bar when BBMACD and TM sell signal was present**  
  
**This was later developed into the Multy time frame version called HA_0001a_MTF although a good indicator which does not repaint people found it difficult to work with and I will explain why**  
  
**When you have a 5min candle we know the bar opens at 5pm and closes at 5.05pm if we use an MLT indictor that shows 15mins then we have to realise that when the 5min bar closes the 15min bar part of the indicator still has 10 mins to run to complete… hence you get a signal on the 5min you look at the 15min and it confirms the same colour and you take the signal … after 10mins the bar ends on the 15min and its now showing the opposite colour and in hind sight you wouldn’t of taken and perhaps you lose. This caused massive problems when looking back on signals through out the day so although it doesn’t repaint I wont inc it here in this thread  
**  
  
  
**Next post will show indicators and settings**  
  
**  
  
PLEASE KEEP THE THREAD CLEAR OF ALL OTHER INDICATORS ATM**

Details of Stop placement and movement, please read this in conjunction with the chart posted  
  
I will explain in screen shot a b c d etc   
  
A - Signal to go short  
B - Initial stop is 1pip above last swing high ( good technical point for stop)  
From A the TM then slopes down it goes flat and slopes down again when the slope is fixed ..ie cannot move which happens at close of candle C move stop to TM horizontal line at D  
From C the TM goes flat and then moves down when slope is fixed ie.. cannot move which happens at close of candle E move stop to TM horizontal line at F  
  
  
We follow down TM horizontal line with Stop but are ALWAYS 1 level above so we eventualy get stopped out at G for 16 pips

Deja vu anyone?   
  
Paulus,   
  
What changes have been made to the system since over a year ago? As far as I remember the old thread failed because of:  
  
1\. the arguments and conflicts (blah blah blah)  
2\. Because the system was just not generating enough profit to be followed up on.   
  
Any changes in MM, filters, the approach...  
  
P.S What happened to your 'Mechanical Trend Trading' thread. I enjoyed the clean charts. Seems like you jump from system to system quite a lot. Either that or you've got major processing skills that allows you to trade many systems at once. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1) Looking forward to your response.

Hey Paul,  
Good to see the new thread without the repainting indicator baggage. Hope it stays this way. I have added a few reminders below, I hope you don't mind me doing this (there is no way to contact you so I could not ask for permission..![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1)).  
  

**SOME INFO FOR NEW PEOPLE**  
  

1\. Make sure you trade while there is enough liquidity. Taking trades in the wee hours of the Tokyo session is not very smart as the system described by Paul can be considered a trend following system. Trading this on an intraday chart requires the right time. Trade with the flow. In the old thread it was suggested to start trading with the London open and I see no reason to deviate from that. Not sure when it opens? See this: <http://www.forexmarkethours.com/markethours.php>  
and this: <http://www.forexmarkethours.com/GMT_hours/02/>  
for the advanced, you might also want to take a look at this, especially if you are considering pairs other than the fiber: <http://www.forexmarkethours.com/volatility/05/>  
  
2\. Please read the whole thread before you start asking questions - some of them have already been answered. As of right now, the thread is only a few posts, which should make it very easy for you. Remember, we are here to make money and you should do your homework before asking for help. However, if you do need help, feel free to ask - there are quite a few people from the old thread who will be willing to help you out.   
  
3\. If you experience any difficulties with your trades, please remember to post a chart with your entry/exit and reasons for entry/exit.  
  
4\. As Paul already said, no additional indicators, please. This is why Paul has resorted to starting a new thread. If you want to know what happened, kindly follow the link of the first post to the previous thread.  
  
Good luck! 

If you don't risk, you don't ever have to lose.

Hi Ace   
  
If you read the thread on mech trend trading you will see I was always having problems with getting it mechanical to a degree where every one could trade the same thing..and then to code it..  
  
This seemed impossible with the thread...  
  
Nothing has changed re The trend magic thread and as for making profits this is a personal view..daily I may make a loss weekly I make a gain monthly I gain overall.  
  
If I had 3 bad days with TM but the month was up overall by 25% Im happy..Not enough returnsd translates into ' returns for whom' ?  
  
The argument started because of the constant debate of TG integrity and here its raised its head again its off no consequence to use now so lets move on

Hi Paulus, I was wondering if you had any experience with StepMA's and if you have tested them against TrendMagic. You insight would be most helpful. Thanks

Yes I looked at step ma for the 1min in some details as the steps were larger between each stop movement but long term they lost more pips even on the 5min trouble was in sideways movement they just stayed at the horizontal and the little steps that reduced the loss with TM didnt happen with step MA resulting in a bigger loss  
  
cheers

Thanks Paulus for your quick reply. I having been using the Step MA with decent results. I'll take a look a TM, and compare the two, maybe even try using both. If I come up with anything interesting I report back. Cheers PTL

Paulus  
It's very helpful that you mark your entries also with a vertical line , so we can be in sync .  
In both cases , 11:15 and 19:20 , it looks you have entered on the first change of the BB MACD color ,but actualy , only after the bar is closed , we can be sure that the dot color in the BB MACD will not change anymore , so how can you know that, during the formation of the bar ?  
Aren't we supposed to wait for the NEXT bar to open ?  
So the entries weren't supposed to be at the opening of 11:20 and 19:25 bars respectively ?  
Tks for answering

Hi Paul  
  
It seems as if there was a long signal before the first short signal, is that correct?

Thanks, I hope this can bring some decent pips in my account on a weekly basis. Good thing we can keep the repainting S*** off this damn thread and keep things real and hopefully simple around here.  
  
Paulus would you recommend using this on the m1 yeh?

So now what's the most contributing factor for a signal? The TM line backed up by the BB MACD? Or vice versa? Or anyone just trading the BB MACD signals?

Hey folks  
  
I spoted a disturbing thing today. Sometimes when price is hovering around the TM colorchange it tends to repaint the past. See the screenshots taken from eur/usd charts today.  
I spoted similar thing several times.  
  
Regards  
  
Kristjan

Thank you for the indicators. I posted a screenshot yesterday on the old thread and it had your HG, TudorGirl's HG and a BBMACD with your 144,233 settings. Scrolling on my charts I noticed color inconsistencies in TrendGirl's HG muti timeframe bars with the BBMACD TM combos and your HG and assume it is because the MACD settings built into both HG versions (the ones in the old thread at posts 81 and 172) may not match the BBMACD which is adjustable or eachother. I read and understand why Trendgirl wont expose her code, but could both of you at least state (or maybe its restate) the MACD settings coded into your HG's? Is it possible to recode them to allow inputs for the MACD settings--that might be asking too much, but please at least give the MACD settings? (also, just what does HG0001 stand for?)  
  
Also, for new people, I just tried downloading the newly attached TM and BBMACD links and it wouldnt open meaning I could save it directly in Indicators but not open the code. The TM in the old thread post 32 does let the code be seen. I found a BBMACD elsewhere that I could download and has inputs for the settings.  
  
I just tried downloading the Vorticity and it wont let me do anything but save it as a .php file. Why wont it download as the ex4 so i can use it?

i downloaded that too and overlayed them, identical except one was green/red the other blue/red. But what purpose were the 3rd color in Supertrend and the 3d and 4th in TM--they dont show up anywhere that I saw.

Paulus is that your way of saying that the MACD 144,233,21 is also the setting you have in your HG indicator as well as on BBMACD?  
Anyone know what Trendgirl used in her multitimeframe HG version?

The original thread is actually fairly interesting and can match War and Peace in length. Lot's of good trade examples and even other systems spawned from it.

When it download as *.php then just rename it to what ever the indi is called and put ex4 or mq4 in the end (indiname.ex4).  
Some indicators are compiled and can not be opened by mql editor, only indicator that end with mq4 and be opened with editor.  
  
Hope it helps

I love systems where there is a magic line to guide which direction to trade ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1). I have a question about SLs though. Initial stop is clear. My question is about the subsequent stops. It looks from the example chart of the short trade that the stop is moved when TM trends downward 2 times. Then the stop is moved not to the most recent higher plateau but the plateau above that one. Am I reading this correctly?

HiPaulhus. Glad to see you back. Is it okay to trade if the trend magic changes colors before the MACD???

No.. G is the spot (pun intended) where that particular trade would have been stopped out. The stop is always adjusted to the previous horizontal line, which means that if you are watching a live screen and TM goes flat for some time, you adjust the SL to the previous horizontal line*****. I prefer to use swing highs/lows, but that's just because I've had so much screen time that it has become easy for me.  
  
***** If you are using MT4, always remember to take into account the spread when adjusting SL levels because MT4 displays bid charts. You don't want to get taken out and then watch the price head in the direction of your trade just because you weren't adjusting for spread. 

If you don't risk, you don't ever have to lose.

Stop on the G spot and never take my eye off the spread... got it. Thanks for clearing that up, bug. I learn so much here.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)

I think the arrow was added manually by Paulus to show the entry on the chart he posted. I don't think there is such an alert in any of the indicators in the template. I just loaded everything up this morning, though. So if I'm wrong and there is an arrow alert I'm sure one of the traders who have been using this system longer will correct me.

I have an indicator that puts an arrow when the MACD crosses its Signal line, but it is MACD only no BB so it may not be useful here.  
  
Also there are several versions of MACDBB. The old thread had the snakelike MACD dots and the BB lines showing. The pictures earlier here didnt.  
I was going to add that if you have the snaklelike dot version, colorchange on the 144-233-21 isnt enough, you need to see the snake move inwards across the Bollinger Band it had been riding or at least straddle it before considering an entry. A little earlier I took a GBPUSD 5 min short trade when the color changed to match TM from a bar or two earlier, but stayed above the upper band and I got stopped out. It was a demo so I dont really care, but looking at other moves I realized it needs to move across the band. I think.

This Indy will give an alert when it changes. It has a neutral color, so you _can_ get an alert without the TM/Supertrend line on your chart changing.

Just a note of caution for anybody who is planning to testdrive or trade (live) this system today or tomorrow on a low timeframe such as M5: the markets are not really in a 'giving' mode right now as they are waiting for figures from the US and UK. Both nations will publish their revised GDP estimates for the second quarter tomorrow. There's been a deluge of bad economic data from the US, but recent high impact news have been unable to rock the boat on either side.   
  
This means that GU, EU and UJ are all moving pretty much sideways until the second estimates of GDP figures have been released. I personally have already reached my weekly goal so I'm keeping out of the market, but if you really feel like you should use every opportunity to test this system, then I suggest to test M1. In current market conditions, with swings between the upper and lower R&S bands, M1 is the only viable TF. So, either wait for normalization or keep out. 

If you don't risk, you don't ever have to lose.

The stop is always adjusted to the previous horizontal line, which means that if you are watching a live screen and TM goes flat for some time, you adjust the SL to the previous horizontal line*****.

That can certainly help but chart will still display the bid price, so you would still have to account for the spread when moving SL. 

If you don't risk, you don't ever have to lose.

![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f643.png?v=15.1)I'm sure your broker thought you were just another 'kid' losing your shirt. The sad thing is that brokers don't mention this to their clients before they start trading and we are supposed to figure this all out by ourselves (I generally don't have anything against them). Good to see that you've figured this out. 

If you don't risk, you don't ever have to lose.

hi back from hols took an extra week although was at home just opened FF today but have been trading and struggling !  
  
Markets have low volatility Aug always seems to be the same allot of people go away on hols in Aug it must have an impact..looking at friday the TM line was almost flat for 8 hours just immpossible to make money when its like that.  
  
Friday i spent the day scalping with 10pip TP and 10 pip SL on a system I dug out of my bag that uses TM..  
  
If its any good over the coming weeks I will post it on another thread ..  
  
In the mean time lets pray for some volatility because without it the best of systems will just crash and burn

I think it is possible but manual trading is way better.

This system is really multi faceted and adaptable. I find myself preferring taking trades using 2 other indicators which dont belong being listed here that need to confirm oneanother, but I always leave TM on my charts to help pick out my SL points and sometimes TP levels especially when market entries need an immediate change to the entry to set the initial SL and TP levels and the TM visual makes it quick. It really does help in any number of ways besides trend. I also still usually dont trade against Paulus' longer term setting for the BBMACD and use it to try and stay a little longer regardless of other indicators.

without getting in to indicators from the old thread that repaint, i am finding that to just take the repainting arrows or dots as a warning, but as long as the TM slope is not flattening, stay in, works.  
  
not meant to start a discussion--it was just my observation.

Hey Paulus,  
I see you are using BB_MACD_CCT that I saved some time ago. Love that indicator for a scalping setup that I use....38,120,20. I see your settings are a bit slower....I'll have to check it out. Here is the source code...I see you have an exe file in post 2.

I think Paulus was trying to keep this thread clean of indicators. Since the alert is merely using the basic setup, seems OK to post the link.

nice trade, but 30 minutes earlier when both indicators went blue together, why not go long treating it as pullback with a new buy signal?  
it would have failed, but thats hindsight.  
  
No need to answer--its because the bands didnt re-expand.  
I'll leave this post up though.

Glad to have found this thread, just a question, on the SMA alert indicator, do I need to change the SMA setting to 21 or leave it on 50? Alerted when colour change to yellow, is yellow neutral?

yellow is when bbmacd and tm arent both the same color, otherwise it matches their red or blue direction

I just uploaded the indicators and this is what I saw now, colour changing at the bottom two indicators but the TM not changing colour? Any idea's?

Alright so basically if TM turned blue that would have been a long entry correct?

EJ Trade - with the time of day and what was happening with JPY pairs, I was looking for an EJ short and I usually do that time of the evening.  
  
AU Trade - The first sell alert I ignored because I was wanting it to break the nearest low from 2 bars earlier. The next buy signal I ignored because it was below TM. The third signal I took because it was bearish price action re the prior bar and I had a good place to put the stop. And AU had been on a good tear and was pulling back on bigger timeframe. Was also about to break an M5 trendline...I didn't draw the line but I could see it. And overall price action on other USD pairs had some influence. So it was not simply a matter of taking the signal. You can't trade it that way, in my opinion. I treat it as a heads up...and I take it if I like the overall price action and what is happening in general.   
  
I'll post the next trade that doesn't work...not cherry picking the trades.

interesting that you dont plot the BB part of BBMACD as a guide to new moves or old ones that just gathered new steam as the bands go from narrow to wider.

are your bottom indicator settings set to match the faster bbmacd right above or the slower one above that?

2 AM EST is Frankfurt open (their 9 AM). Some decent volume kicks in around that time. It isn't like 8 AM EST because London/Europe is open (therefore high volume) whereas Frankfurt opens from low volume.

Our 2AM EST is Frankfurt's 8AM and that is when their market opens. Frankfurt is 6 hours ahead and London 5.

is there a max number of bars on the 5 min between the time TM recolors followed by BBMACD or vice versa before the entry is invalid or too risky?  
  
i understand there are other factors people might consider before entry like pivots or fibs or s/r, but generally speaking, is there a max?

I found this thread 2 days ago. Because I don't like second guessing, I read the first instructional post and stopped there. I use my own exit strategy so I didn't need to read any of that. I can say that on Thursday I started trading TM live. First trade lost 8 pips (but that it would seem, is the beauty of this system), trade #2, rode it for 41 pips, then trade number 3 (on Friday) rode it for 86 pips! Closed all trades and banked 119 pips before NFP on Friday (using TM only)! To the man that created these indies (and the template) I say thank you! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1) This system certainly takes K.I.S.S to a new level of Simple!  
  
"Trend Magic"...sort of has a nice ring to it..yes?![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f647-200d-2642-fe0f.png?v=15.1)  
  
Incidentally, if you would like to make it even more powerful, add a few Bill Williams indicators to the chart (Alligator and Fractals). That's just me though, I love Bill Williams System! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

I realize my post isnt TM directly, but everyone taking short term trades with TM is affected by the new rules in effect mid-October.  
I need a new broker, I was with Gallant but they are moving us to [Forex.com](/brokers/forexcom "View FOREX.com Broker Profile") and look at the difference in the [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide")!! (screenshot taken today--Saturday).

Go with interbankfx.com or [Oanda](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile"). I like interbank better because the platform has many tools that Oanda does not.

> I found this thread 2 days ago. Because I don't like second guessing, I read the first instructional post and stopped there. I use my own exit strategy so I didn't need to read any of that. I can say that on Thursday I started trading TM live. First trade lost 8 pips (but that it would seem, is the beauty of this system), trade #2, rode it for 41 pips, then trade number 3 (on Friday) rode it for 86 pips! Closed all trades and banked 119 pips before NFP on Friday (using TM only)! To the man that created these indies (and the template) I say thank...

Hi Colostarr  
  
You mention you are following the  
is strategy as per the first thread, what do you do to exit, also what pairs are you trading?  
  
Thanks

Yes thats 5 min.  
  
Its a clean method of getting in trend. Like anything its not perfect. Take care around certain times and length of run needed to signal a trade eg if its around Frankfurt open (FO) and you've run 30 pips to get a signal, entry there could be a problem. Also take care if the entry candle is too large for the tme frame you are looking at, 15 pips + can be a problem on 5 min. I focus on taking a signal with a lh/hl.  
  
I have used a 1hr 8lwma to approx trend but this does seem a nice alternative.

These are the kind of set ups I'm looking for. No oversize candles nice lower highs or 2 b trades (see right tick price makes a slight high instantly rejected for a shooting star) in line with system. Entry candles have little/no lower wicks.   
  
Pity they were both too early for me. Good examples though.  
  
There is another sell chance below 113.25 but its often a reversal time so we didn't consider.

Hi,  
  
yes i found this system a few days ago and have started trading it. It seems good, I went back to original thread and have included TudorGirls MTF indicator on a 1hr and have it as Paulus has set it up on 1 min/5 min depending on how things look.   
  
My problem is i either take profit too soon and don't let it run or i try to let it run and it comes back hits stops. Need to work on exit and stops, but I will perservere for a while and see how it goes.

Sorry for my delayed response. My internet has been un-reliable the last few days. For exiting the trades, I use the flatline of the TM and I move it up as it changes levels. I've gained as many as 86 pips in a single trade or as little as 5 pips. I've lost 3 trades this week for a total for -24 pips, otherwise I am up around 200 pips all together. I have applied the TM to only EUR/USD chart, I monitor the 5M, 1H and daily (do a back test on the daily chart with TM and you'll see what I mean! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f911.png?v=15.1) ) Hope this answers your question!

The thread is definitely quite, but I have been trading this method for about 4 days now with STELLAR results! I trade EUR/USD on the 5M, 1H and Daily charts. Up 200 pips 4 in days!

It doesnt really because in your original post you said..."I use my own exit strategy so I didn't need to read any of that."  
Using the flatline and moving from new flatline to flatlineline as the trade develops is the thread method.

Mrs V spotted this one earlier. EJ tracked EU reasonably well this am. EU wasn't a trade ito the rules, this was.  
  
We also do not exit according to the rules. EUR stopped at 1.40 and as mentioned ej was tracking quite close so when it hesitated Mrs V banked close to 30.  
  
At the moment watch gu, eu, ej and au. Looking to trade the one that looks the best.

Right you are. But that is the simplest of exit strategies. I thought you might have been looking for some kind of complicated exit strategy. My philosophy is to keep it simple. Yes, I move the stop up or down as TM changes levels and then wait for the stop to hit! It makes trading fun again! Check the chart I attached today. I took a signal on the hourly chart and was stopped out at 70 pips. I've been using this system for 1 week, and so far can find nothing wrong with it! I've lost count of the pips I've taken, but it's in the 300 to 400 pip range and around an 86% win rate. The bigger winners come from the hourly signals

I looked it up. Guessed it was used in the first tread of this system, so went to post one of this tread, followed Paulus link to the first tread. Click the paperclick, hide images and start looking for someting called MTF CCI.  
  
Try it yourself. You'll find it.  
(But i'm kind enough to post it here![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)   
  
But let me remind you Paulus didn't want us to come up with a bunch of indicators on this tread......  
He started this one to get rid of the huge amount of indy's. Let's keep it pure and like he intended it. I'm testing the system on a 4h chart for 3 pairs. Let you guys know how it performs.

You don't really need MTF CCI, because when it comes down to it, it's just a moving average plotted as an oscillator. All MT4 platforms have the moving average indicator by default. 

If you don't risk, you don't ever have to lose.

Thank you Jules for the indy. I understand the bunch part,, looking for something to make it clearer for me. Intend to keep it simple and will eliminate the ones I can not relate to. Just looking for the holy grail ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f923.png?v=15.1) been looking for 11 years and counting.....lol

Hi, just got through the whole thread. Seems a very nice and simple method.  
  
I have question on the entry though:  
  
**_"Entry long  
  
_**BB MACD blue   
TM goes from red to blue  
  
**_Entry Short_**  
  
BB MACD red   
TM goes from blue to red"  
  
1\. As I understand it the BB Macd should already be blue ahead of the TM for long. That is the BB is already blue then the TM turns from red to blue back to color agreement?  
  
2\. Now what if the BB is red, but the TM is blue and I want to look for a long. Do I wait for the BB to go blue, then the TM to go red and change back to blue before entering?   
  
I guess what I'm really asking does the order of the indicators agreeing have to be BB first, and then TM going against and then agreeing?   
  
So, three conditions?:  
  
1\. BB blue or red.  
2\. TM opposite  
3\. TM swithes back to agreement.

Not exactly. According to the original rules, you have to wait for BB to go blue to look for longs. If TM is already blue, you just jump right in. If TM is red, you wait for it to go blue.   
  
I have traded this system quite a lot in terms of screen time and I can tell you that BB is not really that important once you've traded it for a while. The nice thing about this system is that it doesn't really hide the price so once you have enough experience, you are able to use price action and TM only to place your trades. You can and should use BB if you are just starting to use this system, but once you progress, you should be able to see with your own eyes the lower lows, higher highs and so forth. That's what happened to me, anyway. Alternatively, you could place a moving average (some have already done that via CCI, which in essence just shows you whether the price is above or below a certain SMA) to replace BB. I don't want to deviate from Paul's original setup, but I have found the 50 ema very useful when the market is trending. Also, have round numbers marked on your chart before you start trading (a'la 00 and 50 intraday levels).  
  
If you have more questions I'd be glad to answer.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Hi, another question.   
  
Here is something that I saw today.  
  
Got up today saw both TM and BB were red. So, I got in short as it didn't look like a bad spot.  
  
Shortly thereafter both BB and TM turned blue, but price had not yet hit my SL.   
  
Instead of waiting for SL I just got out early and took the long.  
  
Is this a good or bad thing to do to use the change of TM/BB as an early exit, before SL?

I must say having lots of fun on this method, using to trade 5 min higher lows and lower highs. We do not trade moves through TM even with correct colour changes unless that move itself is a hl/lh.  
  
Thanks Paulus.

Well, tried it today and I lost -151 pips on GU today, over 5 trades, trading the 5M.  
  
Probably not the greatest day to start being friday.  
  
One trade could have been +50 but got stopped out at BE, should have just taken 50 as it was really a news reaction at 7:30.  
  
Looking back my entries could have been better. It seems that the best entry is with the color change, you can't just jump in because the colors agree and hope it continues.  
  
Also I noticed that the BB changes color right along with the TM, so what is the point of even bothering with the BB? Is there a better way to use it instead of just reading only the color?

Hey KD,  
Yep, yep...that'd be Bugs' way, it is worthy to note...  
PA, PA, PA...HL's, LH's...123 pattern, etc.  
Also, note the relationship of EUR/GBP today...Euro is the weaker one,   
so better to look for shorts against USD, YEN, etc.  
Not to mention round numbers as potential targets.  
News is always tough puppy any way, but you did have profit,   
maybe tighten up on the stop to protect profit.  
  
Hope your trades are better for you next week.   
Included a round numbers indy if anyone wants to throw it on their charts.

I'm afraid there aren't any 100% fool-proof rules and you just have to acquire enough screen time to be able to answer those questions. The thing is that I could give you an answer that suits me but I'm not sure it would fit with your trading style (the saying is that each and every one of us has to find a style and a system/strategy that fits their personality). With that mind, however, **_I would like to emphasize that price action can and once you have enough experience, certainly will help you make those calls_**. Vantage has made a very good point in the post that follows your post. Emphasis mine.

So there you have it. Paul's original system + price action. You could try putting little boxes on an old chart to denote higher highs, lower lows and so on just to get the feel of it. Then proceed to live demo testing and see what you end up with. For me, this seemed a little to much to take in at first but trust me, once you get the feel of it, it will be easier. It will still take all the focus and hard work that you would expect from trading, but the amount of confusion should drop. 

If you don't risk, you don't ever have to lose.

Um...I'm not sure what you expect me to answer, really. Money management is a huge topic. In the interest of my time (and others'), could you please specify what exactly do you wish to know so that I don't have to write down everything I know about MM?![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Probably not the greatest day...that's for sure. Now, here's a real shocker for you: you absolutely have to keep an eye on the calendar here at FF and make necessary adjustments to your trading times or lot sizes.   
  
Maybe it's a bit too much to ask, but it would also help your account if you were to check financial news every day to get the big picture (at least once a day, before trading perhaps). You don't have to be a Wall Street analyst to interpret the news that has been hitting financial pages these last few weeks. The big news right now is that Bernanke has been suggesting starting another round of quantitative easing (ie. printing money thereby driving down the dollar). This afternoon Bernanke gave a speech where he touched this matter. About 15 minutes later some important data came out which rocked the USD boat. This is a killer combination of RED impact events all marked in the FF calendar. I'm not mister smartypants so I'm not going to tell you that I knew this was going to happen. But volatility _does pick up_ during these events:  
  
Central banks shape monetary policy  
United States (still) has the largest economy on the planet  
The US dollar is (still) the predominant reserve currency of the world  
**Thus:** anything that the chairman of the Federal Reserve says or does can have a large impact. The same applies for regional Fed presidents, Fed governors, the SOMO chief and a number of vice-chairmen and vice-presidents. This is especially evident in times of change - when economic growth, inflation and/or unemployment stay at a level that is deemed undesirable by the monetary authority.  
  
If this is too much to ask, then trading for profit is perhaps not your thing. Please don't think I'm saying this because I'm trying to outsmart you on a public forum. This is a kill or be killed business and you have to protect your account - reading a bit of financial news and keeping an eye on the FREE calendar at FF is a very simple task and will most likely help you immensely.   
  
When it comes to trading this system, I personally prefer using it with EU rather than GU. GU has higher spread and way lower liquidity. This lower liquidity results in stops being taken out _all of the time_ , which, in chart-speak means that cable doesn't respect S&R levels nearly as much as EU does (GU whips past important S&R levels just to take the stops out and then goes back to where it was). 

If you don't risk, you don't ever have to lose.

Coming back to my previous post, here's how I start my day(s):  

  1. I get up. I eat something and make coffee.
  2. I check the news and blogs I follow for important developments.
  3. I check fx talk for overnight developments and order flow.
  4. I write down news release times on a separate sheet I keep by my PC while I trade.
  5. I check high time-frames for R&S.
  6. I check lower TFs for R&S.
  7. I mark off round numbers (you could do this with an indicator).
  8. I start trading with minimal size.
  9. If I feel everything is going alright, I switch to bigger lot sizes. If I don't feel confident enough or something is bugging me OR there is a huge red impact news coming, I wait.
  10. Once I have reached my daily goal, I pretty much quit trading for the day (not always). Some people don't operate with daily goals in mind because they feel it puts too much pressure on them. I feel that this is a personal choice type of issue (kind of like whether you prefer higher or lower TFs).

If you don't risk, you don't ever have to lose.

I know it will hurt a little but put up your charts and show where you got in etc etc, then comments will be a little more helpful.  
  
Have a look here, <http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=108544> this kind of concept may help you with entries on right side of trend.

Definitely cannot just jump in with a colour change.  
  
No BB and TM do not always change colour at the same time. Not with the settings as set out by Paulus.

This will show what I'm looking for. The lines show the colour changes, the arrow up and down show the next higher low and lower high for the trades.

Vantage,  
Great teaching concepts in your last few posts. Both you and Bug have a gift for explaining these PA concepts so clearly.   
I've been trading Forex for over 5 years now. Always appreciate it when I encounter teaching on this level.  
Thanks much.

I'm familiar with looking for H/L/H sequence through using sonic. ( Stopped using that because there were some good trade because of it, but also a lot of fakeouts)  
  
My questions would be when do you enter using trendmagic and H/L/H, do you wait for it to pass to the other side of TM or just when it looks like a continuation from a lower high (short) or higher low (long).  
  
Also when it hits the lower high, how do you know its not just going to continue upward? Or are you just using the direction of the TM + the higher low as your bias?

Look at the chart again 3 posts or so up. Right side, last arrow, the green candle before is the lower high. It wouldn't have been a lower high if it had continued.... enter the other side of TM line.

in other words its only a lower high AFTER the candle closed, so you wait to see.

Here are my stupid stupid trades from friday, Oct. 16th. Any comments of how I could have done better, using this threads method, are welcome.  
  
Trade are marked with a green or red dot for long or short. The trades are all taken on the 5M on GU. I only trade GU.  
  
My breakout box is set to 11:00 -13:00  
  
1\. Short loss: Had just got up TM and BB were red and price was close to it, so I got in short. Almost as soon as I got in both turned blue so I got out.  
  
2\. Long BE: Got in right after both tm and bb turned blue. Waited for the news. Could have taken +50 but instead I put trade at BE and was stopped out.  
  
3\. Long loss: The hammer before my entry made it look like it was just a higher low to me, so I got back in after my stop out at BE. It of course then tottally reversed.  
  
4\. short loss: TM & BB turned red and had a big candle going through TM. Price of course then reversed on me then TM and BB turned blue so I got out  
  
5\. Long Loss: Because of TM and BB turning blue I got in long again, and of course price reversed on me again and BB and TM turn red. This time I just wait for my stop and am stopped.  
  
6\. Short Loss: Got in after I was stopped out thinking that since everything is the right color for short it will continue and since price made it a point to go so far to stop me out. But, no I picked a bottom again and price reverses. I get out in disgust and quit for the day. And of course if I'd held on this one could have been a winnner.  
  
P.S. Please note that everytime the TM had a color change so did the BB, which is why I asked what is even the point of the using the BB, or is there a better way to use it.

if i were going to trade gbpusd, i'd limit it to 2-6 am est--just before london opens at 3 am est. your charts gmt+0, correct? so that would be 6-10 on your box. they match my broker charts.  
the spread is just under 4 pips then which still isnt great, not sure what it was when you traded.  
  
I also might have considered taking your 2nd and 5th longs except that that they were right at daily R1 so I wouldnt, and that 4th short bar had just dropped 36 pips --something vantage had pointed out to stay away from, although he might have said that to me in a pm.

It seems to me that you exit your potentially winning trades with a loss, instead of being patient.   
Use hard stop that is initially under/above last low/high. If it is too far away then better do not take the trade but wait for the next opportunity.  
Anyway, do not jump out only because the line changes color. Supertrend (TM) is tradeable even without paying any attention to its color. Just above or under is the information you need, and the break of the line is the strongest signal.

Hi Indrek,  
First of all, thank you for contributing to the thread. It seems he did the right thing. While the BB MACD switches direction, he changes along too. Any reason why you said he's being impatient? Perhaps you can share with us?

I just suggest to use hard stop instead of manual exits based on instincts. Any indicator can change its color back and forth, we have to trust our entries.  
Of course, the first thing is to pick the correct entries. In this case, there were false entries, too. But at least two short ones would be winners if the trader did not exit too early.  
Again: initial SL (hard stop) is under/above last low/high. Another option with this system is the previous flat level of TM. If these are too far away - no trade.   
I do not take trades from M5 timeframe if the SL would be more than 25-30 pips.

Why do you say only trade GU then, it has plenty of movement in the US session? Also, Im in US central time so that is about 1 AM for me I think, so thats not going to happen.  
  
My charts are +0 and the spread was about 4 when I was trading for GU.

Yes, I check FF religiously for news before trading. I guess I'll go back to EU for trying out this method then. Though I tend to like GU better as it has bigger moves when it takes off.  
  
Do you trade EU during the US session?  
  
P.S. mmmmm looking back the same friday I got boned in GU, EU would have had a great day with this method compared to GU.

Pardon my language, but that's a really uneducated approach. You could just as well trade fiber with bigger lots to compensate for the smaller pip runs. Cable is like an untrained horse, as it were - it runs as fast as hell but it knocks you off if you don't know what you're doing. Fiber is a much more tame animal - it moves slower and the moves are in clear bounds, making it psychologically and monetarily easier to stay on the saddle. All of this goes back to what I wrote earlier about the liquidity of those two pairs. So, if you want to make more money, why don't you consider trading fiber with lots sizes big enough to compensate for the opportunity cost of cable's appealing pip runs?  
  
I do trade the US session but not as often as I used to. Since I live in Europe, I find it most convenient to trade the European open and late morning session. A few days a week I might trade the EU-US overlap session, but that depends on the amount of macro work I have on hand at any specific time. To be honest, I'm not a big fan of the US session as I tend to have difficulties understanding the way price behaves on a minute by minute basis during that time. I still trade it, but with more care. 

If you don't risk, you don't ever have to lose.

not a great spread like bug said and i've had not great luck with it. there are better pairs for the ny sessions.  
i think the gbp pairs might be better trades during london hours.

Indeed it is. When I find myself having to type eurusd a number of times in a text I usually replace it with fiber because it's just easier (I'm a speedwriter so ease of writing is an issue when choosing what specific words to use, I like to keep a constantly high speed, typing eurusd just feel slow and 'wrong' LOL). 

If you don't risk, you don't ever have to lose.

Bug and or Vantage, on this jpeg I've marked a H/L/LH sequence that matches up with TM & BB from last friday 15th of OCT on EUR/USD. In the US session.  
  
Is this more or less what you look for before entry?  
  
And where would either of you place your entry?  
  
Also I use, "zig zag fractal A," indicator to help point out the H/L/LH sequences, is there a better way of spotting them?

except that red bar after the lower high was the bar opening 830 am est just when a whole slew of economic releases were being reported and TM didnt go red with a bar below it until the 8:40 est bar. stop would have needed to be about 20-25 pips to put it above R1.

Yes, I know about the news coming out at that time. But, regardless of news thats the set up for TM + H/L/LH set up right?

hlh is just an add in vantage uses, its not really paulus' system i dont think, but regardless, the short is after price goes below TM.

Yes, I know it's not in paulus original method. It just seems that if you just blindly enter on the change of the TM and it happens to be a ranging day you could get screwed pretty quick.

I don't want this thread to become a hl/lh thread when there are several (including mine) but very briefly: FO/LO each are likely to have reversals around half an hour in, 7.30 gmt and 8.30 gmt. I look to trade hl/lh's and 2b trades in that time frame exactly as per my thread. Once LO range has been broken hopefully the LO head fake has played its hand and the session range will follow. From there its follow TM as per Paulus with hl/lh's. If 8-10 gmt is quiet then you guessed it the move is likely to happen around 11-1pm gmt. If London range decent then around 11-1 gmt it might well consolidate around its extremes waiting for early US to chip in.  
  
Does this happen every day, of course not, does it happen often enough to build a method around (like Paulus' here) yes. So you can take something like this and some knowledge of likely times of moves in the market and build a method. Always remembering that if you have entered on right side of trend and you've had a test of direction (a hl/lh) and trend resumes again the odds are put that little bit better in your favour.  
  
So we are looking for hl/lh's on the correct side of TM, if the hl/lh occurs on a TM cross thats also fine, but make no mistake we're looking for hl/lh's ie the test and confirmation of trend.   
  
Hope this helps, if unclear perhaps discussion better served on a hl/lh thread and keeping this for TM trades.

Hi Kumo  
Your trades:  
1) Its definitely a lh but price doesn't go 1 pip below the candle. That alone would have failed my final requirement. This little trick will save you some losing trades, honest.  
3) In and around news will do that at times. Nothing you can do.  
4 and 5) Price action has moved much too far to get in, on the sell that last large candle is from 6061 to 6025, much to big and increases your stop and risk level much too much. I get worried at 15+ pip candles.  
6) Again a very large candle closing on RN, both very dangerous. Price doesn't go 1 pip lower below 1.60 but the size of candle, RN both would have kept me out.  
  
Hope this helps a little.

did u go long after the breakout, then slap with a stop loss.  
since the trend is heading south now, u then go short and ride the trend down?

I just eyeball.  
  
Same eur chart, left arrow, clear lh but TM hasn't turned around yet.  
  
2nd from left. There is a lh close on 4075, that prob would be a losing entry with a small stop. Price then tries for 1.41 fails for a nice lh trade below the RN. So if you count this as a -12 ish and a + whatever but bigger than 12.  
  
3rd arrow from left, I definitely would not have let this go to a losing trade from prob close to +20 up.  
  
The x has now made a higher high from prev trade so its a difficult sell to make.  
  
Right arrow down another lh that works nicely but perhaps late in session.  
  
All the sells have nice lh's, entry candles have little/small lower wicks, none of set up candles are overly large.  
  
You decide on your own stop, take profit levels, or whether you'll follow system. Entry 1 pip or so below the set up candle you identify as the lh.

Unfortunately, I missed the previous long trade possibility. If I took it, I would exit manually at the close of the huge candle taking 45-50 pips. Not wise to risk with retracement or reversal.

There were a couple of earlier lh trades, we got this one, exited +24 when move below 50 level stalled. Due to size of session run didn't want to wait for TM to poss get hit, that type of exit is typical of our trades.

This is exactly what I do. If a trade gives you 50 pips in a spike, TAKE IT! Use your judgment, you are trading your money. I have closed NUMEROUS trades just like this while using TM. When market is trending, use it to ride the wave, move your stops and wait. If during a news event it gives you 50 PIPS in a spike...TAKE IT and wait for the next signal. Jeez that's 50 pips you lost!

Thats very good! cool 50 PIPS there.   
For your own strategy, does the BB MACD play a part here?

Rarely...from my experience in this forum, people try to learn a new system and stick to it to the very letter. Which is good, but use judgement. I love to set and forget, and I take the greed factor OUT of my exit strategy. If I see a setup, I take it, if the pair SPIKES (actually took a 100 pip bearish move on Friday!), I close the trade and put the pips in my bank. If it trends in a favorable direction, I move the stops in accordance with the entry instructions, if the stop hits, it hits, if not not I keep moving it until it does get hit. The system is so simple, it is designed to minimize your losses and maximize your profits. If you get a signal, take it, if it spikes close it, if not move your stops until you get stopped out (K.I.S.S). Be happy with the PIPS you get, but you must also be happy with the PIPS you lose. To answer your question, I use the BB MACD for entry (per the instructions), I use my head for the exit. I've lost 2 trades (-8 pips) last week, I banked well over 400 exiting when it felt good using TM for entry. I took one trade today +12 pips, which takes me to 11 consecutive wins using TM since Monday last. Choose your entries carefully, and NEVER give back pips TAKE THEM!. This is strictly my method and in no way am I trying to circumvent the creators strategies. Trend Magic is a phenomenal system! I've been trading live for 5 years now, this is by far the easiest and most profitable system I've seen in those five years! Just keep it Simple!

I have a question about moving the Stop as per the first post.  
  
We move the stop to the last plateau (straight sidways line) the TM creates when that plateau can no longer be changed by a move of the TM?  
  
So, right now I'm in long trade.  
  
A plateau was created, then TM moved up creating a " backwards L," so the plateau can no longer change direction. This is the point I'd reset my SL?  
  
Or only until another plateau is created above it?

Do you think you could post some charts of your entries and why you took them? I would like to see.

Very nice, Mrs V and I haven't had a losing trade yet when our normal hl/lh entries line up with TM/bbmacd in the week or so we're used. Early days yet but thats a solid position to start off with.

Oh to the person that had a bad losing day trading the TM crosses, have a look at the trades Paulus posted on page 1. Whether by luck or flaw each trade had a few things in common. 5 min hl/lh's, set up candles weren't overly large, entry candle had little/no wick in direction of trade.

Sure thing...attached is an hourly EUR/USD from Friday. I took the short signal from the very large inverted hammer (note TM is blue). The TM turned red afterwards (when it changed it only served to tell me to stay in the trade). I set the short at 1.40736, my first stop was set at 1.40171 (actually the FIRST stop was at the high of the previous candle) and again at 1.39210. I stepped away from my computer for a few hours, when I returned the EUR/USD had just formed a bullish inverted candle (very nice one). The decision was too easy, I didn't use TM's exit strategy (that would have cost me around 45 pips!), I set my stop at the high of the bullish candle and within 15 minutes the stop hit and I banked 202 pips! I hope this helps!

Do you only trade the H1 chart?  
  
I ask because I'm wondering if that would be a better idea for me. I'm trying out trendmagic because I'd like to learn a method that when I get up at 6 AM I can find 1-2 trade and stay in till 11 Am for the bigger parts of the US session.

Normally I trade the 5 minute. This particular day the news that hit caused volatile movement. The 5M chart became too erratic to attempt a trade, so I switched to the hourly. At that point I was not concerned with TM, the very large bearish candle SCREAMED short entry (get a copy of Bill Williams book trading Chaos 2nd edition). The angulation formed from the alligators mouth had my mouth watering! Again the TM had NOT given a short signal, the hammer and alligator did! The TM changed color later and made me feel better about riding the wave and staying in the trade...I'm glad I did it was a good day! Most of the trades I make with TM are from the 5M chart though, you can scalp the crap even out of a ranging market! It's phenomenal! If you get a chance take a look at the Daily chart on the EUR/USD with a TM template...I am still waiting for a color change on that..VERY POWERFUL!![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f911.png?v=15.1)

While reading through the whole thread and trying out the TM and BBMACD indicators on H4 and Daily time frames, I was wondering why no one mentioned trying this system on these timeframes and there it was on the last post ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) this system looks very powerful on an eyeball backtest, however the repainting issue keeps coming back on this thread too... i would recommend everyone to demo forward test this to gain more comfort.   
  
Just finished reading Michael covel's trend following and this systems seems to be in sync with the book and trend following.  
  
My 2cents. Try this on higher timeframes and you can cut out all the noise such as economic news. However your money management and your account size should permit that.

Trading it on a higher TF also requires patience which is a very difficult skill to master (speaking from experience). But yes, you are right. TM is very well suited for trend following. 

If you don't risk, you don't ever have to lose.

Yes, that is definitely the case for me. Recently I've started doing a lot more work on identifying and quantifying longer term trends. The fiber is especially well-suited for trend trading, as is obvious from the last few years of price data (leaving aside the QE spikes in Dec 08 and March 09). I still like intraday trading because that's just who I am but I am seriously considering opening up another account for trend trading.   
  
BTW, I've also read Covel's book. It's not what you would expect from a book focused on trading, but is good at making the case for trading trends. I personally think it was a bit of an overkill in terms of repetition. I didn't like the condescending and somewhat callous tone either. From a pure practical perspective it's still good, though. 

If you don't risk, you don't ever have to lose.

i agree. covel's book is a good read for someone who is already sold on trend following. if one is looking for a system, then they'll definitely not find it in the book. in fact, the kindle version of the book was offered for free on amazon. i guess there weren't many buyers before ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) to sum up - i would vouch for trend following but probably not for the book.   
  
good luck with the 'long term' account ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
on another note, ive seen a lot of threads here in the 'factory' about adding alerts to the TM indicator. has anyone come across one that works well?

Well, I had a bit better luck today. 2 Trades, -39 short Loss, +48 Long win.  
  
The short could have been avoided had I just waited for the candle to close. The TM turned red and I got in before the candle closed, and then it of course turned back on me blue.  
  
I got in the long when things were in color agreement and I saw a L/H/LH form. That entry was still a bit late, could have had 80, if I had got in at the optimal spot.  
  
From there I just trailed it as per the first post.

Not to preach or anything but I would remind you of what Indrek said a couple of posts back - enter with a solid stop loss, or, if the risk is too big, don't take the trade at all. That 39 pip loss could've been a 20 pip loss. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Ya I know. At the time the last lower high looked a might too close.  
  
I'm not used to trading methods that have such tight SL. A SL of 20 or less gets me starting to worry I'll get stopped out just by normal movment and have the trade go my way anyhow.  
  
Do you generally find the last high before entry on the 5M holds up as a SL that doesn't get taken out on breath?  
  
P.S. I don't mind good advice at all.

As per the TM and BB there was a potential short on the EU at 20:30, which is 3:30 in the afternoon here.  
  
I saw it but ignored it because of the time of day.  
  
Would anyone else who is trading this method have taken it, and why?

I haven't had ANY re-painting issues, nor will I try to find any. Doing this creates doubt in the traders mind, and makes you second guess an entry! The TM is a moving average, and to my knowledge it WILL repaint while that candle is active. I have yet to see TM repaint a closed candle. While TM is a great system, there are other basic trading principles that everyone should ALWAYS apply, News, daily and weekly pivot points, hammers, inverted hammers, double tops, bear or Bull traps the list is endless. Don't become a slave to just ONE system. I found that TM augments other systems very nicely (as an example Bill Williams method "Trading Chaos", there is a thread in this forum that covers this method). Just don't loose sight or get "tunnel vision" for just one method! Be a smart trader and stick to basics first! Don't make a system harder than it needs to be. Just my 2 cents!![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)

That was a BEAUTIFUL signal! You ignored it because you didn't stick to the systems most basic entry rule, when TM and BB change color at the same time it's an ENTRY. Because of that very basic and simple fact, I would have MOST definitely taken that signal! Who cares what time of day it was ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f633.png?v=15.1)? You need to keep it simple, TAKE AN ENTRY SIGNAL, set your stop loss and wait (PATIENCE!). As a general rule I almost always set a limit or stop 5 to 10 pips beyond my stop loss price. If the market is trending you'll make good on the signal, if it is ranging, hopefully you can recover your losses and then some. For future reference when TM gives you a signal TAKE IT! Hope this helps!  
  
Edit: it looks to me from your chart that you ignored roughly a 60 pip move...knowing what you know now, would you have taken that signal ?

China hiked rates. AUD/CAD and EUR/USD going crazy right now. Not recommended to enter for a while!

"News that China's central bank is set to raise interest rates sent shockwaves around the currency markets Tuesday, with the U.S. dollar soaring while others, most notably the Australian dollar, fell hard. "  
  
Incidentally the AUD is recovering...USD is still going down. I entered a sell signal on TM about 15 minutes before the news release. I have 40 pips locked in right now, waiting for more movement!

Colostarr,  
Do you mean to say you moved your SL to 1.3882 after entering at 1.3922 as the trade progressed?  
What was your initial SL?  
Thanks.

This a trendmagic thread the op has asked that it not be polluted with other indicators.  
  
Correct me if I am wrong but it looks like some THV stuff, and I dont see anything on there resembling trend magic. So, why are you on this thread?

I locked in the last TM level early as it looks like it could possibly be a turning point to me.   
  
+61 pips locked in, so I'm happy even if I am stopped.  
  
P.S. stopped out at +62 pips. Good run. Had I gotten up just bit earlier I could have caught the best entry and been closer somewhere to +100

Hi Colostarr  
Thanks for sharing and posting.  
In the EU m5 there were many signals since 7:45 gmt in both directions.   
How have you filtered them to avoid possible loses ?  
Tks

Congrats! Glad it worked out for you! I stopped at 90 pips! I was lucky in that I got in before the news from China hit, and even luckier that it spiked in my direction! Keep it going! You didn't have those 62 pips when you started the day! Feels good doesn't it? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Yes it does. And what feels better is that I didn't spaz out and do 5 trades within one session trying to find the best direction of the morning to be in.  
  
Just thought I'd upload a jpeg of todays trade so anyone who is interested or has comments, observations, tips, and or questions could see.  
  
I got in a bit later then I would have liked. Got out of bed at 6 Am and was still rubbing my eyes when my screens came on and price was jumping around in that little range there. Had I been up a bit before 6 Am I could have caught a better entry.  
  
Anyway, everything lined up to my eyes good enough so I got in with a stop behind the last lower high and just kept moving my SL down with TM.  
  
I put my SL early to +60 thinking it would reverse. I should have just left my initial TP which was +100 and hit before the move past that stop level. Can't complain though +60 is really nice.

You caught 43% of the average daily movement in fiber* (based on volatility data spanning 10 weeks). If you could keep it up, you'll be trading a big account lot sooner than you think. Well done!  
  
*Average daily movement over the last 10 weeks is 140 pips. 

If you don't risk, you don't ever have to lose.

Ya, one of the things that attracted me to this thread was trend following AND trailing stop set up of TM.  
  
Of the methods I've been toying with the past few months from FF none have had a dicernable, repeatable, and logical way to trail and lock profit that doesn't always take you out too early and give you room to follow more potential move, while still at least locking in decent profit. Trend magic seems to adress that nicely  
  
What I'm really looking for is a way to get up at 6 AM and determine what will be the most dominant direction or trend of the day and stay in as long as I can. Try to catch as much of the move between 6 Am & 11\.

Aren't we all? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
  
What I do is keep an eye on the news. Sometimes it gives you a heads up, sometimes it doesn't. Right now, however, there is a lot of talk about BOE doing more QE (thus the cable weakness today). The Chinese surprise interest rate hike took a bit of steam off risk assets (thus the fiber, gold & other risky asset selloffs). It takes a bit of time to do this and to guesstimate the eventual impact of those stories, but I might say that if you want to stick to trading for the long run, it will certainly not do you any harm to follow the news. Not religiously, having a general grasp of things is good enough.  
  
Analyzing longer term charts is another way of doing it, although this too isn't perfect (nothing is). Right now it looks like the dollar is headed for a rebound (if you're trading dollar pairs, have a look at USDX), at least in the very near term (some of it has already fed through). There might be some more dollar weakness going forward, but that will be decide by the FOMC meeting on November 3rd.  
  
I've already taken up quite a bit of space so I'm going to stop here. Don't want to lead the thread too far off the main topic. 

If you don't risk, you don't ever have to lose.

If you are asking about the GMT shift variable for the breakout box you'll have to ask your broker what + - GMT they are.  
  
P.S. the breakout box paramaters are up to you, they have little bearing on a TM trade. I just use the box to mark 6 AM to 8 AM because I get up at 6.

-6 Long.   
  
-33 short. Could have been avoided. TM changed but BB didn't. But at that time, on the 4 H it looked to me like it could have been a retrace to more short movement. Actually should have been less of a loss but I moved my stop wanting to stay in.  
  
+89 Long Everthing lined up so I just kept riding it and moving my stop to TM when it looked good.

Here is a jpeg of my last two winnning trades using trend magic.  
  
The first was my long I already posted about earlier +89 from the US session.  
  
The second was a short. I followed trend magic rules for entry but put a wider stop (60 pips) , above a resistance that rejeceted price strongly on the 4 H in the past. Normally I wouldn't have a stop this wide using trend magic.   
  
However, because of the huge long spike in the US session and the consolodation that followed, I expected that there would be a reversal short, if nothing else for profit taking from big dog trader. And that if it didn't go my way after consolodation perhaps the resistance above might reject price.  
  
The thick blue lines show entry and exit Long, and red for the short.  
  
I also did not follow the TM rules for exiting on the short. The short movement was so swift that I just locked in 50 with a postive SL, I've seen spikes that fast reverse hard too often.  
  
P.S. Pair is the EU, it's the only one I trade at the moment, and it's as crazy as hell this week.

Then that's what you're going to get. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
  
I hope you can still see the price behind what I drew on your chart. I've been banging on about higher/lower lows and highs in a couple of my posts. Now I get to show what I mean. Now, what I'm about to tell you is not that easy to follow through when you're actually trading, but I hope this will help you see what I deem a good entry point considering higher lows and all that stuff.   
  
On your chart, your entry was at point C. You have already marked two higher lows on your chart that preceded your entry. However, points B and A would have provided a better entry point. Point X marks the spot where you had your first HL. This tells you that something is about to change, since price bottomed at a higher point that before.   
  
The way I see it, you have two potential entry points:  
1\. Reference point A. Once price has already made a higher low, you enter when price breaks through the high that it reached before making the HL.  
  
2\. A higher probability trade could have been taken at reference point B. First you waited for price to make a higher low at point X. Then you wait for it to blast through the high at point A. You enter once price breaks through the last reference high at point B. This is the highest high we've had since price made a higher low and this is a very good entry point.   
  
[There is a third possibility. You wait for the price to blast through point B, make a higher low and then enter once it starts going up again.]  
  
If I have confused you then let me know. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Greetings from Germany, this is a awesome indicator, I earned around 200 pips today with only 3 treads. But now I am really tired, I watched the hole day the screen for the colorchange. is it possibel to code an alert in this indicator?  
  
It would be great if someone can code that after the color change from red to blue a wav will play and from blue to red another wav.

Nice trade David.  
  
If I understand your strategy correctly, you are essentially trading 1-2-3 patterns in the direction of the indicators recommended by Paulus?

i believe alpari is +2, so the offset is correct.

people somehow use it to trade with some kind of breakout.  
i only use it to color in blue the times of day for a given pair i dont want to be entering a trade and color the silver lines black to get rid of them.  
i set the start and stop to coincide with chart times of when i no longer want to be entering and it stops blue when i want to be watching.  
too easy to overtrade just because tm recolors with bbmacd at the wrong session.

G-Man  
I am trying to combine Vantage's HL/LH as I understand it with the TM sys. In other words , If I get a signal , eg  
Blue TM +Blue BBMACD , I will to enter the trade unless I see that price have made HL/LH.  
In my chart you can see that I have entered close to the HL , so it was not a classic break out of the 123 pattern ,  
but I may enter on BO's also.  
Hope it help  
David

thanks for the mtf cci link, i've added it and use it as a final filter like someone suggested earlier, cci30 needs to be on the proper side of zero to take the 5 min tm-bbmacd entry signal.

Hi Simpletrader!  
  
Are you every signal trade on EURUSD M5? Because today many fals signal in the London trade time.  
But I think the M15 time frame is the good entry signals and M5 is the exit chart.

you'd never take every signal. you want to catch the original reversal if possible and if not, then later entries rely on judgment with filter help.

Attention!   
Anyone that uses the ant-gu breakout box to mark the Asian session (or any other session) should make necessary changes due to shifts in daylight savings time. From November 1st London time = Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). This stems from the fact that London adjusts the clock but GMT is fixed (during the summer, London time = GMT+1. If you are trading the Frankfurt session, please note that Germany adjusted their time as well. More information is available here: <http://www.timeanddate.com/time/dst/2010.html>  
and here: <http://www.forexmarkethours.com/>

If you don't risk, you don't ever have to lose.

Is there anyone that has an alarm indicator for when the BB amd TM have the same color indicating when to buy or sell?   
  
This would be most helpful. There was another thread that said it had one but it does not work.   
  
Can someone post the alarm indicator here?

Thanks for the link. However, is there a specific alarm for the combined BB and TM? I think it would be great if there was an alarm that showed when the BB and TM match as in when to sell and when to buy. I only saw alarms for just the BB. This alarm would need to be tailored to the two indicators of the Trend Majic trading system.  
  
Or am I missing something?  
  
Also, what is Super trend?  
  
Thanks again.

forget supertrend it repaints alot. all those other indicators are why this new thread was started to leave them behind.  
the alerts are when bbmacd and tm line up on bar close. load the ones you are testing on a 1 min to get the quickest opportunity to find out.

What is the best time period to use this system? The 5 min seems to repaint alot and it makes it hard to secure a position to make any profit. I am trading eurusd.   
  
I used it this whole week and it seems for every dollar I make I loose the same or more.  
  
Is 15min or 30min more reliable?

This is one of the best indi based systems around that I've seen. You cannot however take every cross and expect to be OK, that won't happen. With respect take this method but have a look at (shameless plug but it may help) my higher low lower high thread. Take this concept with higher lows and lower highs and it honestly should help some. Also be careful of the size of the run taken to generate a signal, times of day (London open head fake to name just one) and the size of the candle that generated the signal to name just a few of the other items to be considered.  
  
Post your trades with charts and let people discuss, you'll learn more from your losing trades than your winners.

Hi all  
Long time reader, first time writer. Love the show!  
  
I haven't tried Vantage's system yet. Still working on this one.  
I hate to refer to other indicators here, but I don't believe they interfere with the spirit of the system  
I use fib pivots, just for an extra heads up, and I take alerts from MACD_SMA_alerts_v2.  
  
Re money management, I'd tend to trade .01 to .02 of my account per pip  
  
  
  
PS Thank you so much Paulus for the system, not least for the clock- I've been wanting one of those for ages!  
  
And Anne(TG), you're a philanthropic wonder. I'm in awe!

Is is possible to take the **BB_MACD_CCT_alerts_v2** indicator and turn it into an EA for any currency pair and in any time period? Where Buy and Sell is executed on the close of the candlestick? or has someone already made this into an EA?  
  
Can someone point me in the right direction? i would like to back test this as an ea. Here would be the specs  
  
1\. The EA initiate a buy or sell based on the color of the candlestick red= sell and blue = buy.  
  
2\. Once an order is in place the ea would not initiate another order until a change in the candlestick color or the user places a stop loss on the order ( a parameter default is none but the user can change in the settings )  
  
3\. The user would need to be able to adjust the following settings:  
Fast Len default is 144  
Slow Len default is 233  
Length default is 21  
StDiv default is 1.1  
UseAlert default is true  
  
Lot Size default is 0.1  
Stop Loss default is none   
Order Initiation default is candlestick close  
  
Basically, it is taking the BB_MACD_CCT_alerts_v2 indicator and adding the last 3 values and making it an EA and not a indicator.  
  
This has exciting possibilities!  
  
Please point me in the right direction.

Now that really is deviating from Paulus' request!  
  
But a robot incorporating these indicators would be fantastic, especially with the moving stops

Are you expecting free candy or something? There are plenty of paid programmers out there. Not one sane person is going to do your work for you for free. Please take your request someplace else.

Visiting the International Space Station would be fantastic, anyone here want to provide me with $2 million so I can take a trip there*? Come on now, people. Paul has provided you with a system that is so simple and foolproof that you don't need a machine to do it. Go demo, learn the basics of MM, get some experience if you can't do it now. I've always been of the opinion that if you want something done, you have to do it yourself. If you want to make money trading, you've got to do it yourself, no sitting back on your couch and waiting for someone to post an EA. You guys really baffle me. How do you think the best athletes, traders, authors etc. made their money? Sitting on a couch? Unlikely.  
  
*This is not a joke. You can take a trip to the ISS with the Russians. Soon you'll be able to visit space with Virgin Galactic, but that is no ISS. 

If you don't risk, you don't ever have to lose.

I don't wish to get into an argument with you, which is why I want to clear up a possible misunderstanding.  
  
I have never asked anyone for any freebies, and would never expect to be offered any.  
  
I'm of the same opinion as you regarding the request for an EA. I was just saying that it would be a better EA than any out there.  
  
Mkay?  
  
Much respect for all your sagacious posts, by the way

ummm... this is the indicator from the Trend Majic system. All I am asking is has this been made into an EA?   
  
What is so dificult about that? Someone made the indicator for free and the group has been testing and fine tuning. That is what I am asking.   
  
I know for a fact this indicator is not perfect but I believe that with the GROUP working to back test it and make revisions the Trend Majic indicator converted to an EA would be sucessful.  
  
So no I am not asking for "free candy" because even though the indicator turned into an EA would not be the final product without revision and testing by the group on this thread at large!  
  
I thought the purpose of this forum is to work on creating a winning system by testing by the group and feedback on how to make it work. So, this is not work for me but free to the group as a whole.

Given the number of EA request in this and the previous thread I think it is abundantly clear that not one member with sufficient programming skills here has the interest to create such an EA and giving it out for free. There just well be an EA out there for this system but who in their right mind would give it to you for free?

Clearly you have never written a single line of software before. It is NOT easy. Talk to the people that write code and they will tell you that creating an EA that works just as you would like it to is far from easy.

That is exactly what we've done here. There are quite a few member here who find this system, or at least the TrendMagic trailing stop part of it, very useful in their trading. Contrary to your opinion, this thread has never been about writing an EA. In addition to Paulus, quite a few other members have spent their time here explaining how to best use this system. Paulus has already created a winning system, all you need to do is USE it.

I'm not following you here, I'm afraid. As I said before, there are people here who have had success implementing this system and are just fine with it. Since they are not lazy couch potatoes, they have put in the time and effort and have learned how to trade. You, on the other hand, want a free lunch. You want nothing to do with trading, instead you want someone to write an EA for you and all you have to do is sit back and make suggestions. I'm sorry but that's not the way it works. If you want the EA so bad why don't you have someone write it for you? There have been plenty of people here requesting for one (but never doing something about it themselves) so why don't you all team up and share the cost amongst yourselves?  
  
I'm sorry to break it to you as bluntly as I did but the fact is that you're not going to find a lot of allies in this place with your EA talk. Please take your request to the Platform Tech forum or, better yet, a professional programmer.

Okay, fine. I know programming is not easy, I have tried it but have been unsuccessful. I know that writing the code for the indicator was not easy either but someone did it and gave it away freely. I know that comming up with this system was definitely not easy but someone did it. (THANK YOU PAULUS!)  
  
I too have tested this system for atleast 40 man hours and have been experimenting with different timeframes.   
  
I do have issues with the system.  
  
1\. repaints. the trend majic indicator repaint alot in the lower time frames (especially 5 min.) that causes miss calls and throws the entire systems reliability in jepardy.  
  
2\. whipsaws. the BB MACD also whipsaws a great deal making it difficult to determine the best/optimal point of entry for an order.  
  
3\. currency pairs. the eurusd seems to be one of the worst pairs to use this system in the 5 and 15 min timeframes. 30 min seems to be more stable but as you get to 4 hr and daily the TM becomes unstable again. Has anyone used other currency pairs and found them reliable with TM?  
  
4\. timespan. Since the market runs solid from Sunday evening until Friday night and the market activity periods are set at different times of the day London, NY, Tokyo, it is physically impossible for a person to remain awake at all times and if they do it is not healthy. My only reason for suggesting an EA is because it can function 24hours a day and we would then have something we could back test. I am not saying this is the answer. Actually, this would provide the basics to better evaluate and fine tune the system.   
  
Also, your speech about others willingness of others to program for the group is incorrect. I have seen and have worked with people trying to perfect a system by making it into an EA. Some people are willing to give it a go for the sake of proving a system after all, people took the time to create the indicators and then modify and post it for the group for free. So, you are wrong with your statements.   
  
Lastly, "bug" dear responder, please let us work together and not be so negative. I am trying to look at this in an objective positive manner. Are you?  
  
I would not ask questions if I did not think this system had value. In fact I think this is a great concept and the system has great potential.   
  
I would not bother to spend a week testing the system if I did not think it had merit. So, please stop with all the spattering about my request and questions.  
  
Can't we be friends and get along?![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
  
  
P.S. Let us take this offline out of this thread. If you wish to discuss further and make comments let us do that beweeen us. I wish to concentrate on the Trend Majic system than argue.

Well...  
I would disagree, myself, that the TM repaints on any TF....those bugs were worked out long ago...when the candle closes on any TF, it does not change color...it's a non-issue.  
The MACD does not whip saw if the 144, 233, 21 default Fib. numbers are used...very smooth in transition when moving in Trend.  
I would even go so far as to say that an EA will never be made for this method as it's variables are way to complex to program successfully. Sure it would be nice, but it ain't happenin'.  
As far as times to trade, London, New York, Asia, etc., well, pick your poison...  
If the market is trending then look for some entries...if it's not, then go do something else with your time...  
After all, the thread is about an indicator called... Trend Magic  
  
Let us here no further talk of this EA business...  
  
Enjoy the weekend, Trading Bro...

No whipsaw? Well let us take a look at Friday on a 5min chart. You will see whipsaw. If you had traded you would have lost money.

I tested this indicator and it repaints even when the bars close. It shows a much better picture in the backtests than in live trading. Also try to trade for a while and then turn off your MT4 and turn it back on and you will see what I'm talking about.

I do not know about the indicator that some people call TrendMagic - if it repaints or not. What I know is that the indicator's other and best known name is Supertrend and it does not repaint. I have posted it many, many times in FF, and people still use wrong versions with bugs...  
I am a heavy user of Supertrend. All systems that I use, include it as one of the main elements.   
What I can say in connection with Paulus' system is that:  
1) it is one of the best that I have found in FF;  
2) if a trader has little understanding about the market then it may demand at least some other filter(s);  
3) if a trader has absolutely no understanding about the market then it is better for him to find another hobby;  
4) the system works best for EU and EY, especially EU.

You can't trade yet you wish to create an EA. I don't understand you. Learning to trade successfully is a very difficult task and some never learn it. Creating an EA that works just the way you would want it to is an equally difficult task even from just the programming point of view. I think you are getting way ahead of yourself. You should learn to trade first and then start talking about an EA. In any case, singling out last Friday as a bad day for trading just goes to prove show that you can't trade thus making your suggestions for a possible EA quite useless, really. You will find a chart with possibles entries attached. But let's step back for a minute - even if Friday were a losing day, it would not matter as the system has proven itself over and over again. If you want to use it to its fullest potential, you first have to learn it. If everyone else has put in the time and effort to learn how to trade and learn how to use this system, why do you expect a fast road to riches with a 'simple' EA?

Nope. I'm going to keep at my negative tone as regards to the EA. Why? It's very simple, really. EA = no work. Trading = a lot of work. Those of us that have used this system have had to learn how to trade. We've been through the emotional rollercoaster and it has taken quite a lot of time (maybe there is a wunderkind among us, but usually it takes a lot of time). By requesting an EA you are essentially sending us a signal that you don't really want to put in the hours and the effort. I don't like it.   
  
**BOTTOM LINE**  
I'm here for you if you want to learn how to trade. Post a chart with your entries and I will show you what you could've done better. Mr and Mrs V may just be able to help as well (depends on whether they still frequent this thread). Paulus is away but you can still read his old posts and look at his charts for clues. But I'm not going to help you if you're going to be clinging to your couch potato mentality.  
  
**I will shut up now for the sake of the thread.**

I just used Friday's 5min chart as a reoccuring example. I posted this one as an example because there are 7 others that occured with this one on the same day. The _**entire**_ week looks like that with whipsaw action on the 5 and 15min charts using this indicator. Also, Trend Majic DOES repaint!![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f633.png?v=15.1)  
  
Additionally, I am a successful forex trader but I use Elliott Waves and trendlines mostly. I have been trading and living off my own trading profits for 3 years now. I work for myself so I am not a noobie.

And there still is no clear resolution to these problems. If you want to be helpful as you state, please post what the latest version of the indicators are and what you think the answers to these questions may be.

> Nope. I'm going to keep at my negative tone as regards to the EA. Why? It's very simple, really. EA = no work. Trading = a lot of work. Those of us that have used this system have had to learn how to trade. We've been through the emotional rollercoaster and it has taken quite a lot of time (maybe there is a wunderkind among us, but usually it takes a lot of time). By requesting an EA you are essentially sending us a signal that you don't really want to put in the hours and the effort. I don't like it.

Then I am sorry for you. However, I am always on the look out for a better mousetrap. Especially when I see a potential where it could be refined and made better. EA's just simplify the system and then the fine tuning can sometimes result in making a potential system better. Just bnecause it is an EA does not say that this is the answer to trading. All systems in all instances fail. EAs prove this. Also, it is easier to back test and possibly find better settings to optimize a trading system. If you cannot see that then I am sorry for you.

Great and glad to hear it!![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1) I respectfully ask you to answer my questions and provide the latest indicators and state what the setting should be that work.

Category 1s just identify entry points in the direction of a wave.

Discovered this system yesterday, very simple to execute, clean signals (as I believe strategies should be;-)), It is a refreshing change to many of the systems out there that tend to confuse rather than simplify trading.  
  
I have been using s/r for a while now, trading the bounce of those levels but am definately going to give this strategy a go.  
  
What I have found interesting is the additional clarity that the Supertrend brings to my s/r levels when trading the bounce.   
  
All good stuff.

Hi Evaluator, have never come accross your indicator before can you tell me how you trade it as I am not too familiar with the elliott waves or the numbers displayed by your indicator.

Well, this just goes to show that you have a lot of learning to do when it comes to trading. I'm not belittling you, we've all been there. The trick to using this system is to figure out what entries **not to take**. I provided you with 2 charts that should give you an example of what entries to take. TM repaint? Then use the Supertrend (another name for TM) indicator that Indrek has posted.

Well good for you. But it looks to me like you've been trading higher TFs and need some time to get used to M5. Either that or your EW and trendline approach is clouding your mind. Whatever the case, it seems to me that you need some additional screen time. Again, I'm not belittling you, I'm just pointing out the direction that you should be heading in order to improve your trading results with this pariticular system.

I'm all done with adding new indicators. I also don't understand Elliott Wave, in my mind it is way too subjective. I'm sure there are people who find it applicable and I congratulate them for figuring out something that I couldn't. I would also like to remind you that Paulus specifically asked people not to post any new indicators (too many indicators was the reason the last thread died):

I see what you are talking about there...I guess one could call it whipsaw, but...  
  
I view this phase, I think more appropiately, as an indication of the market moving from Trending to Consolidating and from Consolidating to Trending, etc.  
As to losing money, well, that would depend on your expectations of Take Profit. After all, it is only a 5m TF.  
  
I think I am going to run the Super Trend from Indrek's post with the BB-MACD to see if it will produce the set up for a trade that you are looking for.  
Should prove interesting.

**Evaluator,**  
This looks interesting...Loaded it on to chart with the   
Trendmagic/Supertrend indies...seems to be acurate on all TF's...  
I put the color to None for the #1 and left the others unchanged...attached is 15m trade I have on the USD/CAD showing the layout...  
  
Do you have a preference as to a TF that you like using it for most?  
Thanks much...

Whipsaw? What whipsaw? The 5 minute chart presented ample opportunity to profit from the movement of price. I thought I posted two charts illustrating that...I must be going senile or something.  
  
Whatever guys. You seem to be more interested in defining whipsaws according to your personal P/L statement and requesting some magical programmer to write code for you than learning how to trade and/or use this system.   
  
I'm singing off on this thread. Goodbye.

Bug,  
I completely agree with you on the subject of an EA for this method...Must be some misunderstanding there...  
I was pointing out that the BB-MACD does help with defining the transition from Trend to Consolidation and Consolidation to Trend...  
Of course, also adding the candle formations of a Hi/Lo, 123 patterns, Pin Bars, etc., as this transition occurs helps with the entry...  
Hope you decide not to "bug" outa here after all...  
Appreciate your input...

Bug,   
  
why did you mark some of the trendmagic lines with the Xs? That's where the indicator 'broke'. It started to give a signal and then it corrected itself, but of course if you followed it you'd enter it. If you were trading it live those would be losses, right?

This is one of the easiest systems to trade. If you focus on trading when the trend is changing and not try to trade every time price crosses TM, it is profitable. And you can trade the cross of TM in the direction of the prevailing trend with a little price action. With good money management, you should be able to handle the losing trades. I don't see what there is to bicker about on a simple system like this.

Which indicator were you actually following for your entries? It is kind of confusing from this screenshot. From what I'm seeing on your screnshot, you were pretty much following the middle indicator only. Also, which indicators are the ones displayed below the chart? Thank you.

The very first post says it very concisely...  
  
**"I found and used a combination of 2 indicators BB MACD and Trend Magic ( TM).BBMACD was used for gauging of the trend i.e. up or down and the TM was used for entry and stop loss"  
  
**It's not any more complicated than this.   
  
It might be productive to post some trades in real time....and folks could comment. This approach works on other pairs and other timeframes....  
  
Cheers

Thank you very much, CanuckCT. However, what confuses me is the 3rd indicator that you have on your chart. Is that MACD? Thanks again.

You have obviously not read this thread....and it's only a few hundred posts. I've already posted a link to this, it's discussed on the first post, and is in the predecessor thread.  
Cheers

It is a very simple and effective system. As indicator systems go this is less stressful than most as it provides entries and exits mechanically. I will only use the three inidicators ie price action, supertrend and bb macd combinded with my s/r levels. They all fit very nicely.  
  
Thanks to the guy who created the thread :-)

cce   
  
thanks for the feedback. i would not use it in 5 min. i would recommend 30 min or 1 hr timeframe because it will clear up alot of the whipsaw acton that occurs to frequently in especially from what I have seen in the BB MACD indicator and the repaints in the trend majic.  
  
i like the use of BB MACD and trend majic indicator. i am always looking for indicators that can identify the true top and bottoms of a major wave movement. that is why i find these indicators so useful.   
  
i just downloaded supertrend and will test this week to see how well it acts with repaints. hopefully it will removes the repaint issue with the trend majic indicator repain problem.  
  
the 3 level zz semafor indicator is good for identifing the exhaustion areas of ups and downs. on major movements you can make good returns. the problem i have is that sometimes it will identify a top as a strong 3 when it is actually a 2 so you have to watch it.   
  
again i would not use 3 level zz semafor indicator on 5 min charts because of the whipsaw actions that can stop you out.  
  
good luck trading.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

simpletrade,  
  
i listed that as a demonstration of the whipsaws that occur. also, understand i am not going to live trade this i only use demo on new systems.   
  
and you are correct i have 2 windows open running side by side to make comparisons because it is easier to see the two indicators individually. so in my example screen shot it does show 1 indicator. i have the other in another window running next to it to better see the two running beside each other.  
  
also, from my testing since the market reopened the supertrend seems to be the better of the indicators because it does not repaint.....so far.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)

> Well, this just goes to show that you have a lot of learning to do when it comes to trading. I'm not belittling you, we've all been there. The trick to using this system is to figure out what entries **not to take**. I provided you with 2 charts that should give you an example of what entries to take. TM repaint? Then use the Supertrend (another name for TM) indicator that Indrek has posted.

bug,  
  
yes, you are belittling but i can see that is your nature. the difference between us is i am a strategic trader and you are a tactical trader so we are destine to look at things from different perspectives and see things completly opposite....![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f620.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f94a.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f620.png?v=15.1)  
  
i recognize that even though you may not.   
  
therefore, i understand why elliott waves will be completely alien to your trading habits. elliott waves are are used more for strategic trading by identifing trends and the wave structures they contain.   
  
i will admit that i am looking for longer trades that can get me 100s of pips per trade and not 5 pips here and 9 pips there because unless you are trading huge lots (very risky) because the returns are justified for 5 pip trades when you look at the amount of effort, time, and stress to make those trades.  
  
don't misunderstand i like these indicators because they have the potential to find exhaustion points in major drives. paulus has done a good job by putting it out there for us to see and i thank him for his kindness.  
  
also, you are correct i like trading in longer tf because they tend to be more stable. i find that with these indicators 15min, 30 min, and 1 hr tend to better.

You can get in with small stops meaning runs like this give ROI of around 5-7% from 1% risk. You only need to get a couple of these a month with smaller trades here and there to have a great return.  
  
For me the left arrow would have been a stretch due to sideways pa and 15 min was indecisive, 2nd arrow from left would have been an entry for me (no trades at all today due to some major thunder storms computer was off).  
  
Eur and gu basically the same pic as this.  
  
Avoid sideways pa, avoid 40-50 pip runs that generate 1st signal, avoid entry candles that are overly large. Lower highs/higher lows along the way can get you in if first trade missed. My 2c.

This was 1 and only trade we tried to set up today. Perfect lh entry around 6010, lost contact just as the lh candle was closing so we switched everything off.

Hi guys,  
  
I have been using the following indicators in my account with great success.  
  
1) Supertrend nrp.  
2) BB MACD  
3) Nonlag lot.  
4) 3_level_semafor  
  
I use 15 min char for entry. Look at supertrend and nonlag dot.  
  
BBMACD is slightly lagging compared to Nonlagdot.  
  
The exit has been my problem. I come out too early if i use my money management rules ( 1:1). If i use any of the indicators above for exit, i feel i loose some pips.  
  
What is best strategy for exit?  
  
Thanks to all the wonderful indicators. 

Intraday only.

Nice chart setup Vantage, it looks similar to mine (ie camarilla levels) although I have my grid builder sr/levels (ie every 00, 50) on as well.

EUR/USD at 11:45 GMT +66 pips  
GBP/USD at 11:00 GMT +55 pips and +45 pips  
EUR/JPY at 11:45 GMT +106 pips  
4 trades giving you +272 pips (max potential profit). If you take only 50% (+136 pips) I think it would be a good day ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1). This strategy is full of opportunities every day. I couldn't have taken advantage of them because of my full time job...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1)

You were the first trader to answer my qeustion ( indirectly) how you look at the chart for exiting a trade. Unfortunately, no one wanted to answer to my post. Probably in this thread, the traders _do not_ answer to queries by newcomers to this thread?  
  
Anyway, i am seeing RSI21 and CCI 14 indicator, in your chart. How do you you use these indicators for this sytem, thanks.

Today was a super easy trading day. You could get pips with a shovel. But unfortunately this isn't the case every day, so don't get overzealous.

Guys,  
  
I am using this system and trading since 15 nov.  
  
6 trading days. Collected 280 pips untill today. Total trades : 38. Win : loss ratio = 38 : 8.   
  
I opened four trades today and earned 84 pips. All ended in profits. Average 21 pips per trade. 

Intraday only.

By the images he posted, I would say he is using simple S/R lines to exit

It was mentioned in an earlier post that yesterday was a good trading opportunity to make money, but it is not always like that as you know. However, it is still not difficult to make pips every day using this system even when the market is slow. The supertrend and the bb indicator are very good even when the market is tight (ie to keep you out as well as in the trade).  
  
Simplicity is key which is what this system is:-)

After sitting through a largely go nowhere (2 BE trades and a +17) London session I took a break and missed a couple of nice ej trades 11.20 and 12 gmt.  
  
Got this eur trade, we'll see where it goes, target is RN hopefully and if pa strong perhaps we'll go through RN and get to 85 level, we'll see. Nice lh, shooting star, little/no lower wick.  
  
Stop is at BE.

Almost taken out at BE back down to 3518 if we don't push down I'll exit with something from trade, TWT.

Out +33. PA struggled down and RN perhaps an issue, happy to take profits.

Nice.  
  
50 pips today, yesterdays big fall and easy trades I missed due to storms here. So yes can easily believe 128 pips. Low stress, small stops, generally low draw down before trades move on.  
  
For newer traders compare the above ej, eur charts posted to this go nowhere junk on gu. Look at the last gu move that generated the single red dot. Took 40 pips move to generate that signal. The entry candle alone was around 17 pips, not the kind of set up that will generate low risk trades.

1\. What is the significant of the greyed area that is usually displayed by the Ant-GUBreakout indicator? Is it that it is not safe to trade during those period or what?  
  
2\. Apart from the GBPUSD and the EURUSD pair, can I use this Trend magic system to trade other pairs too?  
  
  
Your answers will be highly appreciated.  
  
Thanks.

EJ - short from 111.459...i'm trying to use price action to gain a slight edge on entries, hence why this was taken even though the BB indicator has yet to turn red....will probably regret in hindsight, but i'd like to think price action and indies can live harmoniously sometimes. sl currently above the swing high and i'm targeting the 138.2 fib extension initially and if hit will reset the fib following pa down to derive a new 138.2 ext tgt.  
  
Edit: scratched @ b/e. EU looking bullish again to me, not worth the risk in holding longer.  
  
Edit: ha, turning south again, so will try another short entry if it breaks the lil support @111.36

scratched for b/e, if these trades don't move away decisively from entry it's probably best to exit for small profit / breakeven. I took too long to exit this one really, given it's Thanksgiving. Still, there was 10+ pips in this one for those more nimble.

This is a wrong entry based on PA.   
  
I would simply follow the Trend indicator and enter long or short. It is a lagging indicator but as you said it avoids you from wrong entry.  
  
See what happened today. If you have followed trend indicator, you may not have entered short at 1.3320. !  
  
Indicator is great and if we follow that strictly, it is still great !  
  
By following a lagging indicator, you are on 'Track" even if you are not catching the "top" or "bottom" 

Intraday only.

May I ask why you prefer them over Bollinger Bands? I have tried them out too yet maybe I am doing it wrong, because I couldn´t get a distinct advatage out of them yet.  
  
Your insights would be much appreciated.

Both have nice lh's to reject the move up, both have set ups that have not moved too far, entry candles not too large. The lower wicks are little/none.

Mostly personal preference....I find the TMA bands smoother and I like that. It takes a bigger move to reach the edges of the TMA.

Can someone explain their exit strategy.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f615.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/2753.png?v=15.1)   
  
When should one exit a trade;(4 examples)  
  
1\. When the color of one of the two indicators change?   
  
_Opinion:This tends to lead to premature exit of a trend._  
  
2\. When the color on both the indicators change?   
  
_Opinion: This tends to give up a significate amount of profit on some trades and make profitable trades a loss on other occurances._  
  
3\. When you have candles setting higher highs on the sell or lower lows on a buy?  
  
_Opinion:This also can lead to premature exit of a trend and loss of greater profit.(sometimes sigfnificant profit)_  
  
4\. When the trendline in broken on a direction?  
  
_Opinion:This is the old school way for me as I am a trend trader. However, it does have its downside especially when working in a 5min environment because it can get you out of a trade with no profit or even small loss.  
  
_I have played with it in those 4 scenarios. How does the group exit a trade?  
  
Also, do you use a stop loss? If so, what level? I use 100 pips.  
  
Lastly, the Supertrend indicator seems to be more stable than the original indicator listed in this tread. Supertrend does not repaint like the other and therefore is more constant.  
  
Thanks in advance for your input.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

I like to enter a trade when supertrend has 'turned the corner' so to speak, indicating trend direction. Observing the above posts and my own charts when supertrend is flat that to me indicates indecision and a ranging market.

Good. But requires caution when supertrend line is flat.  
  
Another thing i noticed, the trend starts during europeon session, when we get up from sleep already the trend is on and might reverse during us session. How do you solve this?

It is nice to see lower highs or higher lows or some confirming price action...had a nice smooth lower high on the AUDUSD sell. Sure would be great to be in a different timezone.

It's not part of Paulus system....so is it a new system....and should it be migrated to it's own thread?  
  
Paulus's system is not broke...and I think he wants to keep it pure.  
  
My two cents.

I know that, it's just that since navk posted that he was using nonlagdot and that one person asked for it and you also asked for a screenshot, I thought I'd attach it.  
  
I don't mean to go off on a tangent.

2\. In Ant-GUBreakout setting, what value should I input in START and END time.

Hi canuc, sorry i did not reply to you but game has replied.  
  
I have been using non lag dot indicator and supertrend very successfully.  
  
I enter long once i see non lag dot changing colour from red to blue. Take profit 10 pips stop loss previous swing low. Almost 10 pips stop loss. It works perfect.Vice versa for short.  
  
But as this author of thread has said, when trend magic line is showing "long" and non lag dot shows blue, you can take more pips, not 10 pips. Just try it out. all the best. 

Intraday only.

Don't expect this to be any better than what you have here <http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=214635> this is a method like any other and blindly entering when 2 things happen won't help. It still (and always will) be trading price action, candles etc etc. These indis are just trying to keep you on the right side of short term trend.  
  
TM/supertrend is basically trading right side of CCI 50 (Steve Hopwoods thread explains).   
  
I don't know what nonlag dot is but you could just as easily chuck on an 8 lwma on your charts, they're so close.   
  
All of a sudden trading above below CCI levels with an 8 lwma doesn't sound so special. That basically is what the Andrew thread is. If it works for you fine, good luck.

when H or L of 1st candle that closes to the opposite side of ST/TM is exceeded, and when indicators agree. This is trading Higher H, and Lower L in a developing trend.

Hi all,  
  
I took the liberty of modifying the last version of the STnrp by using the output of the CyclePeriod indie (from Ehlers' book) as the internal CCI period (instead of the fixed 50 period).   
  
You need both attachments in the indicators folder, but put only Adaptive SuperTrend on the chart, insted of TM or current ST, if you want to play with it.   
  
The variations are minor at a glance, but might prove useful, depending on one's entry style I guess ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1).

Unfortunately I was away from computer for this one but it has everything I look for. 1hr and 15 min positive closes, hl, 5 min candle with little/no upper wick (for the buy).

BBMACD - 38:120:20 is a good setting compared to what you have.

Some opportunities from this am. All nice lh's in line with trend. These kind of opportunities come virtually every day in London session.

I was out Fri and did not trade at all. These are 2 likely trades in line with 1hr and 15 min neg closes and of course the trend.  
  
Nice lh's little/no lower wicks. The middle x I wouldn't have considered at all as the set up candle is 20 pips.

Nice hl, little/no upper wick. Never followed through really, lost internet a couple of times so we decided to exit +12.

i guess this is no longer a trend magic with bbmacd thread like paulus had intended?  
he moved it here this past August because of all the other indicators that were getting posted and had nothing to do with TM. He said this in bright red letters...**PLEASE KEEP THE THREAD CLEAR OF ALL OTHER INDICATORS ATM**  
  
If you want to cloud a TM thread with unrelated crap, go here to the old link [http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...=165948&page=5](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=165948&page=5)  
  
And by the way, your nonlag dot indicator is far less effective than HMA hull trend.

My guess is because although price had made 1 lower high, it hadn't made a lower low so at least another lower low gives confidence that the trend has changed to down 

Dream big, start small. Have it all

Whilst I think this method is simple and helps keep you right side of trend I don't trade it blind. There was some resistance there and some 15 min hammers. I waited for a lower high and move below 15 min hammer low.  
  
So I trade it with my hl/lh tweaks but think the simplicity is fantastic.

Mrs V and I are taking this week off. I'd suggest if you are to trade don't look for big runs grab those 20 pips and be happy.  
  
I know jag has been trading per a couple of posts on hl/lh thread, Paulus also has been trading through the last 2 weeks with good success.

I'll get that thread link now.  
  
PS The only reason I'm on now is Mrs V is listening to Andre Rieu, my goodness Sarah Brightman, 3 tenors, Andrea Bochelli (excuse any typos) I can understand but Andre Rieu wheres the sick bag.

Vantage.   
  
I have seen several of your posts. Did you put the arrows in your graph or does the indicator post the arrow on the screen? If the indicator puts the arrows on the screen please post what indicator you are using.  
  
Thanks.

I put the arrows on to show the candle that set up entry for me. When price goes above/below the extreme of that candle thats when I go in.

you mean you sold 3332 and covered 3282 for 50? 3782 was a long time ago--more like 500 pips. either is nice.

i saw that first entry opportunity but was trying to figure out the importance of EURUSD and EURGBP to a successful GBPUSD move.  
EURUSD was climbing back but its TM and BBMACD were short so that concerned me and EURGBP was confirming short --which made sense since the GBP relative to the EUR was therefore climbing, but 2 bars later EURGBP reversed direction although its TM BBMACD didnt.  
  
I kind of thought EURGBP at that time of day was more controlling on the GBP than EURUSD would be on the USD since US markets and banks were closed. But I still passed on the long entry. Is there a co-dependence? I see a lot that EURUSD and EURGBP need to be moving the same direction for an entry of either to work irregardless of whether both TM BBMACDs are the same color for the 2 symbols.

I don't watch eurgbp at all so cannot comment there. I used to have swissy up to check that all are agreeing. 1 has to lead generally so if you miss that one then may get chance to trade the other that catches up. I have taken swissy off.  
  
Am looking to concerntrate on trading in line with daily and viewing anything else as counter trend.  
  
Cannot remember which trader said it but 'if its going up buy it, if its going down sell it'. So if daily is up I'm happier buying etc etc.  
  
So daily was up, we had broken above a D res area, 5900 from 14 Dec, and the Asian move down was rejected on 1hr. So quite happy to buy retraces on something going up.  
  
On eu (as mentioned on hl/lh thread) I was expecting problems 3500-3550 so I just decided to leave that one and focus on gu. If I was watching Fri pm here (US open) a perfect upper close little upper wick hammer on 1hr would have given confidence I think to buy. It closed on 3550 area and one of my other rules of thumb is smaller bounces from key areas = good chance of fail of that key level. You'll see from 5 min the hl's going into US open suggested level would fail and move up had good chance.

in other words, on the 5 min you still follow TM and BBMACD but ignore new setups if they are counter the daily trend?  
  
also 'swissy' is chf with what paired currency?

Since Mrs V started trading with me we are taking profits around 20-30 pips. She has been inducted into the 20 pips bank hall of fame.  
  
I want to use the daily (green candle green histo and vice versa see chart as example you'll get drift) more as my definition of trend. Then using this method (with my hl/lh tweaks on entry) to let trades run a little longer in that trend direction. I'll take good counter trend set ups but hopefully there will be a difference in pips banked.  
  
I don't know if I'll get this right as banking early is pretty much in my dna, they say you can't teach an old dog new tricks!!![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f937-200d-2642-fe0f.png?v=15.1)

Thanks SimpleTrades -   
  
Question - can you recemmend another indicator, or share some insight using the TrendMagic indicators, for judging how deep into a trend is is prudent to avoid taking a position and wait for a reversal signal??  
  
Thanks  
Mario

Hi everyone, I've read through a fair bit of the first part of this thread and now onto this part.  
Is there a problem with Tudorgirls indicators, everything seemed great for a while then it 'all went wrong'?  
I know I'll be told to read through the whole thread but can someone briefly fill me in and be very kind and post the latest indicators and template as I'm starting to get double vision now.........

.. if you are interested in BB-MACD I suggest you read and learn how to use it! In my opinion and experience just looking at BB-MACD color is not much more than looking at up/down sloping MACD. Just because MACD is dynamic (combined with BB) doesn't do much good in this system the way it is used!. Also adding TM to the mix does little good as it is nothing much more than CCI (if you trade color only same as trading CCI).  
  
Before you comment this I suggest you do your homework first...  
Manual for BB-MACD use:  
[http://www.nexgent3.com/Nexgen%20Sof...ay1%202010.pdf](http://www.nexgent3.com/Nexgen%20Software%20Services%20User%20Guide%20May1%202010.pdf)  
  
Videos where BB-MACD used:  
[http://www.nexgent3.com/newvideos/Fi...pe%20Trade.htm](http://www.nexgent3.com/newvideos/Fibonacci%20Momentum%20Type%20Trade/Fibonacci%20Momentum%20Type%20Trade.htm)

ps.  
I'm currently programming Nexgen T3 indicators (of which BB-MACD is one) for MT4, I am also testing them on MT4 tick charts (build with custom script). I might even start a new tread about that here or TSD, but for now I prefer to stay private with it... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) Anyone who can contribute is welcome to join and PM me...  
  
Here is a screen shot of the system on MT4 25 tick chart:

I was always sceptic about the simplistic use of MACD BB in this system.  
  
the pdf is spot on- thanks for that.

Hi Trend Magic Traders,  
  
  
I have a very similar method for Daily Charts and just wanted to get feedback on Trend Magic Entries . It seems that if we also added 1 more rule ( filter ) for entries it might help increase winning % and reduce drawdown on trades. Since we are entering " Long " above TM and " Short " below TM we are in affect using TM Indcator as Support and Resistance. One filter we might add to entries is " only take LONG entry if opening of entry bar opens above TM and only take SHORT entry if opening of entry bar opens below TM ? This way we are entering LONG trades above resistance (TM) and entering SHORT trades below resistance ( TM ).   
Any thoughts ?   
  
  
Thanks for sharing TM Method Paulus I have followed it since the original thread with Tudorgirl.

I'm new to FF and the original of this thread is the first one I've read. I'm just wondering if there are still interest in writing such a strategy into an EA? As someone who always use EAs, I can't imagine how can anyone validate a system without making it mechanical and test it over time. Visual testing is far far from accurate and forward testing is usually too slow to build enough data to draw concrete conclusions.  
  
TM is a good trend indicator however because of of repaint issues, I would choose to use TG's MTF indicator, which doesn't repaint. I know some people who had trouble using it, although in my view, if you use it correctly, it does have value.

BB-MACD and TM show nice results in trending markeys but return the money in ranging and choppy mkts... just try to programm them into an EA and try! Lookin at BB-MACd with TM (basically just CCI) is basically looking at two very similar lagging indicators and really do not bring much to the table! S&R, pivots, harmonic pattern, channels etc are mich more useful, most lagging indicators are absolutely useless and putting them together won't change anything!

Usually many traders loose money during choppy markets and consolidations.  
The main road to profit is good money management. That's all.

How can any trend indicator with any kind of accuracy not being a lagging indicator? Can someone foresee the future? I don't think so.  
  
This is what we have to live with. If you want a indicator provide stable and accurate signals, it'll be lagging and not sensitive to price movement, as a result under the market condition when there's no sustained movement it'll likely only tell the trend near it's exhaustion point. However, during long movement, it keeps you in and capture more profits.  
  
On the other hand, if you have a indicator that is very sensitive to price movement and "foresee" the future price, you will get repaint problems as well as many fake signals during choppy markets. I don't care how mathematically advanced you are, you can't get around it. As no one can tell where the price is going to move in the further, all they can do is "repaint".  
  
I agree with the above, money management are key. So far the two most useful tools I find in trading are: well capitalized account that can sustain temporary set backs and sensible take profit. The deeper the pockets, the easier to make money.

I will probably go as far as saying that a good trader can make use of most common indicators and make profit out of it. The reverse is also true.

Yup, as far as I know fund managers in large investment funds use only 1-2 indicators and daily chart. That's all.

I'm not sure how the current TM works, but atleast the one i used a while ago had a redrawing issue.  
  
Problem with TM comes when CCI crosses 0-level and TM will redraw, so what you see on history chart is not what you see on live trading!   
  
I used TM (actually just CCI) in one EA and solved the redrawing by programming a parameter for treshold margin around 0-level, so inside this margin no buy/sell signals are given only on crossing treshold up or down and if treshold set to 0 indi works as original. For example if treshold set to 20 indi value neds to go above 20 or below -20 to give entry signal (TM to change color) in between we are in no action zone indicator drawing yellow

If you can sit though a 400 pip drawdown you'll be able to trade that way also. Not being argumentative I agree thats how the big boys trade but they have bigger pockets to sit through the pain. That would wreck MM needed for us to make a return.

Paul, This thread started in June 2011,  
but now, i see you are active in kevinator trading system's thread and post your trade using another system(not using this trendMagic).  
so i want to ask to you, Is this Trend magic system reliable enough for live trading? If so, why you don't be active in this thread by posting your Trade using this system (not another system/strategy)?  
  
Thanks

I would use it on 4-h or daily chart.  
But if you want to trade intraday, I would recommend you to use another strategy. - Find the book " The new commodity trading guide" and read n#m strategy for 15-min chart

My thanks to Paulus for introducing me to this excellent indicator. This indicator is so good that you do not need any other tools to trade the 1 min chart. I have discarded all other tools and this is the only one I use - it is really that great.   
Now nowhere in this thread have I seen a clear explanation of the MACD BB tool; so I did a Google search and found a wonderful video on this tool specifically.

The name of the indicator is BB MACD cct.ex4, and you can download it from this thread - Post #2.  
  
Instead of 1 MACD BB indicator I actually use two instances of the same indicator. I call these the Fast and Slow MACDs. Here are the settings  
  
FAST MACD BB (38, 120, 20, 1.1)  
SLOW MACD BB (144, 233, 20, 1.1)

Hi   
  
I am using a similar system with supertrend and MACD BB on a 5 pips range bars chart.  
  
check this post  
  
[http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...72#post4790872](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=4790872#post4790872)  
  
  
I have posted an EA that takes signals from supertrend/ trend magic. If we could incorporate a filter of macbb in that EA, this system would be worthwhile.  
  
Long and short signals as per supertrend signal and macdbb to filter countertrend trades.  
  
Strategy is to open 2 or multiple of 2 lots....take partial profits at 10 pips or so and allow other lots to run till the supertrend signal lasts.  
  
We can just put the EA and switch it on /off as per macdbb.  
  
Anybody interested in modifying this EA as per this system?

Hello everyone,  
I recently discovered TrendMagic and find it to be very effective as an exit strategy. Could someone directs me towards an EA that closes the trade using Trend Magic ?  
I'd like the trade to be stopped when we have a cadle close on the other side of the the TM or have a stop placed one level above the TM line as explained by Paulus in post #3.  
  
As anyone seen this coded somewhere ?  
  
Thanks

Hi, Jani72. That's very interesting. Can you share your customised CCI indicator?  
  
Thank you, in anticipation.

Anybody else notice that a possible trading system would be buying/selling when price crosses over the TM line? Looks profitable to me, could be seeing things though so let me know what you think!

You are absolutely right about it. I always wondered why people are continuosly trying to trade the color of TM/ST instead of trading the break. To my mind, the color is absolutely unimportant.

Anyone traded this way? Because it looks to me from visual back testing that it's be great.

Right guys,  
probably some of you has been receiving a lot of emails endorsing this oustanding and most profitable "software" that gives signals with uncanny precision. Please go to this website because the story about the conspiracy of scams' sellers and bankers who threated him not to spread this knowledge is fantastic! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)   
<http://indestructibletrendwinner.net/>  
  
Austin is pretty close to Karl Dittmann and this fact alone should make everyone careful about "his" products...  
Well, the news is that now he is selling this Indestructible Trend Winner that is a lousy copy of this Trend Magic or Forex Simplification System that is also available here <http://www.forexbees.com/forex-simplification-system/> for free.  
The only difference is that he added the fractals to set Stop Losses and a yellow line between the red (sell) and the green (buy) lines to warn you that a change of colour is probably about to happen.  
Look at the two charts: one is made with Austin's indicator and the other one is made with Trend Magic template. Pretty the same, eh?  
The settings are the same as well: CCI 50 and ATR 5.  
  
So my advice is: save your bucks and keep on with this system that is much better than Austin's one ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

That's why THAT thread needs to be deleted.   
  
But if it's getting page hits, well.. why not. The "freelance NASA astrophysicist" nothing but a scammer working with another user that was also banned.

Good indicator. Congratulations to all. Keep it up. Giancarlo  
  
However when the market is sideways, with TF 1 Min is a disaster. Better go on TF 5m or more

That thread was a scammer's paradise.  
  
TudorGirl (wasn't a girl), Edgetrader and TRO all converged on it.  
  
The TudorGirl posts are some of the funniest you'll find anywhere. Her "grandfather" even showed up here vouching for her. One of the most intricate scams I've witnessed.

Please tell me more, and what happened to this system?  
  
Nobody use BB_MACD anymore?  
  
Look OK to me on short term charts e.g. 15 M, any suggestions?

Ended up taking 21.2pips on CHF/JPY trade and 15 pips on EUR/JPY trade because i wanted to go to bed and i am yet to get over leaving trades in while i go to bed when no profit is locked in... CHF/JPY the lowest low was 31pips and using the system you would have gotten 14pips as for EUR/JPY lowest low was 37pips from when i enterd the trade and following the system would have been 15pips...  
  
I also believe its all in how you use your stoploss in any system and how your emotions are trading the plan, with the aud/nzd i pulled out early because i felt the price was oscillating, as soon as i closed it the price fell my way to 60pips on 15min time frame if i didn't interfere with that particular trade.  
  
i have placed 6 trades using this system so far...  
EUR/JPY 20.9 pips profit  
CHF/JPY 4.8 pips profit  
EUR/CAD 14 pips loss  
AUD/NZD 5.2pips profit  
CHF/JPY 21.2 pips profit  
EUR/JPY 15 pips profit  
  
i entered on the candle after the yellow vertical line

Hi Fugly,  
  
Dr. Zain Agha and his Zee Systems are doing great.  
He just came up with another great system called Zee Money Maker (.com)  
He has also started a Signal Service Zee Inner Circle (.com)

The trend is clearly bearish as outlined by the white trendline; the redlines outline the support trendline, price may reverse on the redlines, a break through them will open further fall in price. The green trendlines are current resistance line and the yellow lines simulate a possible price movement.

I did take a quick short when the fast MACD BB crossed over the slow and changed color. Closed when it bounced off the 200ma.

In the forecast the green dashed resistance line is expected to resist any bullish force has it occur in point 2 it occur at point 1 as forecast, but it only drop an average of 40pips. Now I expect the same resistance force that occur at point 3 to happen at point 4 as indicated in 1Hour time frame screen shot above.  
  
  
_4hour Time frame review_  
  
The point 1, 2, and 3 emphasis how important the bold green trend line is at 1.0979 price level at point 4. Possible price reverse or Sell entry is expected to occur at point 4.

The support price at 1.0811 and resistance at 1.0967 as formed a bullish trend outline by the white trend line. The solid red support trend line is expected to hold the price from falling further while the dashed red trend lines indicate possible bear trend that the bull must break-out from as simulated by the yellow and blue dotted line. The blue line indicates possible price movements, the yellow line indicate expected price movement and the green trend line is the resistance line.

The profit target 1.0840 was taken as expected. Now the price movement calls for caution because the bear force still exists between the red dotted trend lines. If the price can maintain a close above the support of 1.0800 between January 12, 2016 and the open of trading for the European session on January 14, 2016, the bull should break out of the red dotted line. The blue simulating line shows bear force exist within the price range of 1.0900 and 1.0800.

I am running the TrendForecast EA on MT4 build 950 on window 7 right now and there is no problem. The DLL import should be enabled. If the problem occur again, provide the detail and the operating system the mt4 is running on to check it.

I got it to load (TrendForecast EA on MT4 build 950 on window 7 as well) I think another ea was conflicting so i did a fresh install of MT4 with basic indi's etc.  
  
Is it supposed to be plotting something because it loaded, but nothing is happening and a sad face.

Ok, I noticed the mt4 terminal you are using identified the EURUSD pairs and GBPUSD pairs as "EURUSDi" and "GBPUSDi" respectively, the TrendForecast.ex4 will only recongnise "EURUSD" without the "i". That is why it won't load. The solution now is to load another EURUSD chart and GBPUSD chart without "i".

Hmm, I cant. That's the designation with the broker. Anyway you can include a setting for suffix?

Re-attach the EA to EURUSD 4hr chart and send me the screen shot of the message in the expert log on the terminal for further review.

Since the expert log did not report any message from the EA that means the EA did not run on your mt4 terminal, I guess some application is interrupting the operation of the EA, may be you should re-start the mt4 and temporarily stop other custom software that might be running on the terminal before re-attaching the TrendForecast.ex4 . I tried it on my mt4 build 950 and its working.

Download this new one and input the symbol in full as it's indicated on your terminal before loading, for example: EURUSDi. Let me know how the EA operation works.

I did what you said in [FXCM](/brokers/fxcm "View FXCM Broker Profile") mt4. Closed all the other applications and mt4. And then reopened mt4,attached the EA to the chart but it's still not working.It is working on [Oanda](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile") mt4.Thanks anyway!  
  
By the way, does the EA only forecast for one week? or it will continually forecasting for the next week?

Ok, make sure the "Allow DLL " is enabled, delete the previous TrendForecast.ex4 I sent to you, and download this new one I attached below.

If the EA keeps printing DLL not allowed, then the DLL is not enabled on the terminal. I am using the EA on thesame Tradersway mt4 terminal and it works.   
I think the DLL is not enabled on the mt4 terminal, it may be enabled on the EA settings but may not be enabled on the mt4 terminal.

Go to Tools in the mt4 menu and select options, then now navigate to the Expert Advisor menu to check if the DLL is enabled and retry to load the EA again. I attached some screen shot below.

A new feature has been added to the Trend Forecast technical analysis, called the "Trade-Time-Zones". The Trade-Time-Zones shows the Trend entry and exit point in time period. Price can make an entry point for a trend or take profit for an exit at the Trade-Time-Zones. When price start to make a correction around the Trade-Time-Zones, it's a good opportunity to exit or enter a trade.

When attaching the EA to chart, ignore the INPUTS required and click OK button to load it and Allow DLL function must be enabled for the EA to work.

Should the GBPUSD follow the simulated yellow line to close above 1.4000 on 3rd March, 2016, price may maintain the bullish green trend to break out on 4th March, 2016. Currently there is a bearish pressure for the 1.4000 support level.

Ah ok thanks. But there is any other version that works on other pairs? Maybe a premium/paid version? Or that not exists?

Hello, there is a paid version that works with other pairs including GOLD instrument. You can still get the trial version. What are the currency pairs you are interested in to check if a trial version is available?

**_A little detail about the triangle trend line_**   
  
The triangle trend line identifies the current market bull and bear force. When the triangle is facing up the price is actively bullish then when the price cross into the triangle facing down the bear force is active. This help to identify when to buy and sell a trade.

The current bullish triangle facing up is currently overbought for the 1.4501 level; it will be more comfortable for the price to correct into the next bullish triangle facing up; indicated in the LONG PATTERN image, to trade for the 1.4501 level on route for 1.4569 level. Any price push up towards the 1.4501 level in the current bullish triangle will be a risk on trade.

And for a sell trade to occur, the price has to break through the now support green trend line as indicated in the SHORT PATTERN image to target the 1.4283 level.

On EURUSD, in my opinion, even though I don't have any open trade on EURUSD at the moment, but if I had a open trade on EURUSD, I will close it now and look for a selling opportunity in the upcoming bearish triangle facing down using the trendforecast_v1.2.ex4 rules.   
  
**_GBPUSD Forecast Update 31st March- 1st April 2016._**  
  
A interesting formation pop up from my trading archive on EURUSD within the period 2015.05.11 to 2015.06.30, something similar may occur tomorrow on GBPUSD, so trading tomorrow especially at the non-farm payroll release calls for caution.

If a rejection of the bullish triangle occurs between now and end of trading tomorrow, it will confirm a HEAD and SHOULDER pattern I have spotted. And for now in my own opinion, I have closed all Buy trade on GBPUSD.

I really enjoy your work with this indicator! Most people underestimate the power of dynamic support & resistance trendlines and channels. In fact, most price action is based off of these simple trendlines. Please let me know if you're still using your indicator and are continuing to be profitable with such system. If you have stopped using this system, please explain why and what other system you have in place of it. Thanks!
