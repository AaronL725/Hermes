Hello, Traders!  
  
The system I’m going to introduce here has nothing new in it. I just tried to describe it with some strict set of rules as much as possible.  
  
The beauty behind this system is that initially it does not rely heavily on indicators. There is no such thing in it as “when indicator 1 does that and that and indicator 2 crosses lvl such and such, I enter long or short”. I believe this kind of approach to be essentially wrong because when you rely only on indicators they do not give you the perspective of what price is doing.   
  
Use indicators to guide your entry only after you’ve examined PA and you know what pattern or model you’re playing. Be that Double Top or Bottom, Head and Shoulders, 1-2-3 Pattern e.t.c.   
  
Use visual tools first – trend lines, divergences, S/R and fib lvls and then use indicators to enter.  
  
I don’t know how to emphasize more on this, but once you get this idea in your head, you can use any indicators you like for your entries.   
  
For our PA examination we’re going to use **Trend Lines** and **Divergence**. But before I get to the explanation of the system itself let me talk about some important general stuff first.  
  
_General Info:_  
  
1.**Timeframe:** I use 5M TF. It suits my needs of active intraday trader the best. This doesn’t mean that the system won’t work on other timeframes, but initially this thread is intended for intraday trading.   
2.**Timing:** I advice to look for trade opportunities during following market hours: 5 GMT – 8 GMT and 11 GMT – 15 GMT. This is how the pro’s do it, so instead of inventing the wheel lets just do what people who really make money on forex do. I got these timing hours from one of the best threads here on FF – the Sonic R thread (<http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=114792>). Plus that’s how Dean Malone does it on compassfx. So if for some reason you don’t believe me, go and see what these people tell you.   
3.**Pairs to trade:** I trade only EURUSD with this system. Again, this doesn’t mean it won’t work on other pairs, instead I believe that first the technique has to be mastered to the point where you do not miss any trade opportunities on one pair. Add more pairs only after you’ve felt that you can use it effectively at least with one pair.  
  
_Template:_  
  
Here I’m going to describe the indicators I use and why I use them.  
  
1.**MACD (12, 26, 9)** – I use for spotting divergence and I trade only with its direction.  
2.**Stochastic (5, 3, 3)** – I use it to spot divergence where it can’t be identified with MACD.  
3.**EMA’s 20, 50 and 200** – I use them for visual trend identification.  
4.**IB** **(Inside Bar)** – I use this indicator to spot low-volatility areas in the market.   
5.**Fractals** – I use them to identify pullbacks and points used for drawing trend lines.  
6.**Semafor (8, 13, 34)** – I use this indicator to identify price swings and points which are used for trend line drawing.  
7.**PivotsD_v5** – I use this indicator for identifying intraday S/R lvls and targets for TP lvls.

As I already mentioned we will be using **Divergence** with MACD or Stoch and **Trend Lines** as our primary tools for spotting the setups. The system utilizes approach of trend line break plus the return move.  
  
  
_Setup Rules:_  
  
1.Find the divergence with MACD or Stoch indicator. Check out the PDF file attached, in particular pages 22 and 23, to see what types of divergences should be looked for on Stoch if simple divergence can not be spotted.   
2.Use Semafor Indicator to identify significant swing highs/lows which will be used for trend line drawing. Draw trend line and wait for the price to break it.  
3.Wait till MACD turns to your direction. This usually coincides within few bars with close of price below/above 50 EMA.   
4.Wait for a return move.  
5.On the return move wait for the fractal and inside bar to form.  
6.Enter either on the break of IB or on the break of new trend line which is drawn through the newly formed fractal.   
  
**Why wait for a return move?** We always wait for a return move after the break of trend line since these set-ups are very high probability ones! Return move is a necessity for SL placement. If price explodes without any pullbacks then it’s not the right setup – skip it! We identify return move using Fractals indicator. If a fractal has formed on price swing, that means we have a valid return move.   
  
**Why use inside bars?** According to Jeff Wilde (askjeffwilde.com) as described in one of his trading courses, whenever you have an IB the market is consolidating into a tight range of low volatility. And as we know market always explodes out of tight ranges! The natural market cycle is to go from low volatility to high volatility and back again. When you enter a trade during low volatility it allows you to “buy low and sell high”. If you buy after the market has become volatile then you are “buying high and selling higher”.  
  
_Let’s consider few examples:_  
  
The pictures below show examples of recent EU trades.   
  
1.First picture shows good double-bottom setup on Tuesday May 18th. Entry is explained on the pic. PivotsD_v5 indicator gave exit 60 pips away at the R1 lvl. (It can not be seen on there since it calculates lvls for current day only).  
2.Second pic shows an example of trade using Stoch divergence from the pdf file attached. This trade happened on Monday May 17th and could’ve earned you up to 50 pips.  
3.Third pic shows today’s PA. There was a good divergence and double bottom, but price gave us no entry because it just went straight up.

With the rules described I recommend to use the following approach when trading this system: **Have a checklist prior to the entry!** And if one or more steps from it do not agree, skip the trade! I urge people who will be posting here prior to any trade post the explanatory picture along with a check list! That’s what I’m gonna be doing and hoping others will do the same.   
  
This approach helps to organize oneself whole lot. You trade using strict rules; the rest is up to the market!   
  
Here’s the checklist I will be using:  
  
1.Is there divergence on MACD or Stochastic?  
2.Is trend line broken?  
3.Has MACD turned to my side?  
4.Is there a return move?  
5.Is there a fractal?  
6.Is there an inside bar?  
  
Well, I think I’ve said everything I wanted. So let’s start making money! I will see you tomorrow during the 5 GMT – 8 GMT session.   
  
Best Regards!  
Snu.

Good Morning, traders! Lets start trading!  
  
There was nice H&S on EU yesterday during US Session.  
  
I was not at home but still managed to get 59 pips. Not much, considering it went 200.  
  
Here's the pic and checklist:  
  
1\. Divergence on MACD - YES  
2\. TL Broken - YES  
3\. MACD went above zero - YES  
4\. Was there a return move - YES  
5\. Was there a fractal - YES  
6\. Was there an IB - YES  
  
As you see, everything was ok except for timing. But I still decided to go for it!

Yes, I use them as a visual aid for TL drawing. Nothing more.

great, simple system.  
  
Mine is very similar.  
  
I use 24ema, 55 ema and 100sma  
Macd crosses and Divergences.  
I also use an 8ema on higher TFs for 'bounce' orders etc.  
  
The system works if you stick to it.

hmm i think that we should looking for div only or stoch - there is no situation i think that there is a div on macd and on stoch there is not?  
we should focus on stoch easier not to serarch here or here.. stoch only  
what do you think?

I understand what you are talking about. But in those cases when there is divergence on MACD it's kind of hard to spot it on stoch, because quite often you would have to look for it between extremes which are several swings apart. Anyways, if you're good with it try to use only stoch! But please, post pictures and show people what you see!

i'm a divergence fan but typically i focus on higher timeframes. this method is great for trading them on smaller TFs. i've attached the MACD indicator i use. it's the standard 2 lines plus the histogram. some people also trade the histogram divergences, not me

Yes, looks like its going up!  
  
Have to come up with some rules for re-entries, i guess. These would be good in case your BE is hit or you missed the initial entry for some reason.  
  
Well, anyways, enough for me this week!  
  
See you all next week  
Have a great weekend!

It's pretty much almost the same as yours.  
I don't use a Stoch, I use a 14 RSI  
  
When RSI is OS in the 15/30m TFs, I'll watch the 1/5M TFs.  
When RSI is OS and MACD is crossing up, I'll go long.  
Just the opposite for shorts.  
  
Very similar to yours.  
I'll add one of my charts to your thread later tonight when I get a chance to sit down here.  
  
Many pips to all !

Please do post a screen shot, but also can you give what  
are your rsi settings, etc? Could post template  
so we all can see and understand what you see.  
  
Much appreciated. All the best  
  
Good pips to you on the new setup SnuSnu!

Hi, Forex Girl!  
  
Any TF is fine and it's used pretty much like Zig Zag - it helps you identify price swings. You can adjust settings yourself, I personally prefer 8,13,34.  
  
8 is for minor swings  
13 is for intermediate  
34 is for major ones.  
  
Play with it and find combination which suits you the best.   
  
Regards,  
snu.

Good Morning, traders!  
  
Long setup is forming on EU. My order is in place.  
  
Checklist:  
  
1\. Is there divergence on MACD or Stoch? - YES (see the pic)  
2\. TL Broken? - YES (see the pic)  
3\. MACD went above zero? - YES (see the pic)  
4\. Was there a return move? - YES  
5\. Is there a fractal? - YES  
6\. IS there an IB? - YES  
  
They might push it lower though before Frankfurt Open, in this case we will have nice double bottom.  
  
Regards,  
snu.

Perfect entry using 30M TF! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Not much going on during our trading times regarding the entry setups.  
  
There was a good entry yesterday during late US session (see the pic).  
I also advice you to look at higher TF from time to time. This will allow to maximize your profits - you could still enter on 5M chart, but keeping in mind what Higher TF is doing allows you to stay in position longer. See the 30M chart to get an idea of what I'm talking about.   
  
As I allready mentioned before I'm in a process of writing rules for additional trend-following entries. Just have to discuss them with several people to make sure everything is ok, so at the end you guys here get all the best! So stay tuned.  
  
Regards  
  
snu.

Hello, Traders!  
  
Sorry for not posting anything today - we didn't have any entries according to the system during our timing. There was a good entry during Tokyo. (See the pic.)  
  
In the following post I'm going to describe pullback entry rules, so even though initial entry is missed we could still have an opportunity to enter the market.  
  
Regards,  
snu.

Additional entries we're going to consider will be trend pullback entries.  
  
I advice to utilize the same checklist approach as with our primary entries here.   
  
_Entry prerequisites:_  
  
1\. **Prior trend:** Since these are trend pullback entries, the main thing we need here is a trend. The rules for spotting the trend are the following: If 20 EMA > 50 EMA and both sloping up and MACD > 0 the trend is up. IF 20 EMA < 50 EMA and MACD < 0 then the trend is down.  
2\. **The pullback:** The pullback is considered to be valid when the Stochastic indicator goes above/below the 50 lvl. Also it is important to look for hidden divergence on the indicator. Hidden divergence tells us that trend is most likely to continue in our direction. No hidden divergence - no trade, remember this!  
3\. **Pullback depth:** When analizing the pullback it is important to see that it retraces to some sort of S/R lvl. So allways use additional tools, such as fib retracement lvls, trend lines, moving averages and S/R lvl indicators to spot potential areas of where price is most likely to go.   
4\. **Price action:** Price action is another aid to anticipate the end of a pullback. Wait for a period of consolidation on the pullback end - look for inside bars.   
5\. **Risk/Reward ratio:** Before even considering the entry, calculate if risk to reward ratio is acceptable. I advice to use minimum 2:1 ratio. This means that your potential profit has to be at least 2 times greater than the amount of pips you're risking.   
  
_Entry:_  
  
When all the prerequisites apply enter market either on the break of an IB, or wait for a price to close above 5 EMA and enter on the break of that candle.  
Place your SL few pips above/below the pullback lvl. Place your target at the nearest fib extension or some sort of S/R lvl.  
  
_Example:_  
  
Let's consider today's example of long entry on EU. (see attached pic.)  
  
1\. MACD > 0 and 20 EMA > 50 EMA and both were sloping up - the trend is up!  
2\. There was a hidden divergence on Stochastics.  
3\. Price retraced to the 20 EMA and to the trend line.  
4\. IB formed at the end of a pullback.  
5\. As seen from the setup we risk about 20 pips and our potential target is 40 pips away from the entry point, so the R/R ratio is acceptable.  
5\. Enter on the break of the bar which closed above the 5 EMA.  
  
_One more thing worth mentioning:_  
  
Its important to understand, that **market never plays by your rules, so you have to play by its rules.** This means that one time price might retrace to 20 EMA, another time it might retrace to 50 EMA or a trendline, next time it might do a completely different thing. The point is - you never know! Thats why you have to be creative and keep in mind all the possibilities. I believe this to be the trickiest part in trading, but once you're good with it, you won't be missing any trade opportunities! This is something to work towards for everybody, and this is one of the reasons I run this thread - so people could come here, and share with others what they see. This way we could grow towards becoming better traders together!  
  
Cheers and happy trading, all!  
  
Regards,  
  
snu.

With start of our afternoon session looks like we have a H&S with the small one inside the right shoulder. I would wait for the break of bigger TL and then look for an entry. Any thoughts?

Early entry trade closed @ BE! So i reentered According to rules.  
  
Ideally entry should've been @ 1.2262 - on the break of IB, but because of my broker spreading i could only enter @ 1.2254.  
  
Now position is @ BE

You mean you shorted and the market went up, and now you're trying to overwait it?

I don't know ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1) But I'm more down biased in mind.  
  
Draw TLs and Wait for price to break them and retest then you'll know.  
  
Something like this I would say.

Yep, I'm kinda biting my nails now. Gotta learn to stay in longer.   
  
I also believe that splitting position is the best way to maximize profits.

Interesting thought pivotman, i never really paid attention to round numbers!  
If you like the system, join in and start posting setups here! I think everybody reading this thread will appreciate your input as well!

Gj, pivotman!  
  
Could you plz explain why you entered from that point?  
  
Here's my trade for fast 30 pips:  
  
30M showed divergence both on stoch and macd, i entered on the break of the low of the bar which broke previous high to the upside.(So-called 2B pattern)  
  
Ep: 1.2380  
Sl: 1.2395  
Tp: 1.2350

Looks like a potential pullback re-entry setup is forming.  
  
But I'm skipping it for two reasons:  
  
1\. Timing  
2\. Bank Holidays.

I believe that trading 5 minutes at betonmarkets will be better and give better returns.  
  
With 5mins trading of fixed odds, i get better returns than i do in fx. In the trade i state the amount i want to trade and win and in 5 minutes, i have my cash.... no lots... no account size checking.... only place trades and win. Who else have tried it?

I noticed good setup to the upside, but overall market direction is downwards (according to the higher TF). I didn't analize higher TF first thing in the morning to get the idea of an overall bias. If I did that, I would not have missed the entry to the downside.   
  
From now on I will try to post charts of higher TFs first thing every morning.  
  
Using todays example:  
  
15M showed strong downtrend: 20 EMA < 50 EMA and both were sloping down, MACD was below zero. Price retraced to the trend line and Stochastics showed hidden divergence. There was a nice entry around 1.2275  
  
The pictures are attached. 5M chart shows two entry points. One @ 1.2278 - after break of the first trend line. Second one around 1.2255 - after the break of the second trend line.

Closed half @ +25. Now free trade  
  
Edit: closed second half @ +30, decided not to wait for the target since overall trend is to the downside and this was a retracement move

From my graph i would only have entered at 1.2169. Pls tell me if my analysis is wrong. Thank you!

Destarder, your entry @ 1.2269 is absolutely correct, the entry I made was an early one and was made because I saw H&S model there and entered on the neckline break.  
  
The pic according to your entry is is attached.  
  
When you post pictures, you can attach them by pressing the "Attachments" button and selecting pictures you want to share with us from your PC.   
In order to save a pic from MT4, rightclick on a chart and select "Save as picture"

Ok, guys as you probably noticed my big problems is that I cut my winners short. This problem needs to be solved.  
  
Any suggestions how to avoid exiting early, maybe someone can share a good indicator-based exit strategy or give an advice on how to lead the trades in order to maximize profits? I would really appreciate it.

wow the trade really took off. A pity i didnt take it as i was worried when i saw ur entry. Still got lots to learn. Anyway how would you draw the latest trend line? it looks like another good set up for a down trend as there is divergence on the stoch? Thanks for the help!

maybe u can set one lot to take profit at 20pips....and the other one u can set trailing stop for 50pips...that way u can give the market some space to retrace.....just an idea...

off course no problem but its still "under development" ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
first read something about alf and tvi from this thread  
<http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=226154>  
in first psot there is version with 2 colour tvi but i like to use tvi as a colour candles ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) its easier to read  
  
its 2 charts for m5 and m15 on m15 with alf and tvi fractals sr , stoch from m15 m30 (for conformation) and from h1 to not trade against some biger trend ! and zerolagmacd for looking for div , on stoch looking for div too!  
and m5 temp almoust the same + mtf alf to se alf from m15 on m5 chart and stoch from m1 to catch "momentum" also stoch and macd for div  
i dont need any semafor from first post to draw trendlines but you can add if you like ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
entry with break trendline div on stoch or macd cross stoch on m30 and near to cross stoch on h1! and cross the alf ;D  
exit half +20 rest when tvi candles change colour ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)   
something like that but you must feel it !  
ps im still working to delete unnedet things i jus need couple more weeks![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Here is 5M chart.  
20th EMA is below 50th, 50th below 200th.  
MACD below zero line.  
Doble bottom provides deep pullback to the fiboLVL.  
Looks like good hidden divergence is forming.  
So i'm gonna look for short entry. Any comments?

Hi Guys,  
  
I was wondering if you guys are seeing a upward divergence.   
  
From my attach chart, it has already broken out the TL. An upward fractal is there, there is a inside bar, what is lacking is a return move which seems to be happening now.   
  
Will u guys take the trade?

Mini-divergence on Stoch.  
38.2% fibo retrace.

Well, according to your picture the upper TL was not broken so far - I dont see any bars which closed above it. Technically, everything else seemed ok to me.

it is still a chance![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1) but remembour buy low sell high! its important i personaly dont belive in this big numbers its all in traders head ! thats why if let say 10000 traders belive in this particular big number it can be a s/r place  
but if no there is no magic in it![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
but technicly enntry was ok remembour not every setup must work   
if you will have time read "Douglas, Mark - Trading In The Zone" he write a lot about psychology of profesional trader ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) you have not to worry about small loses it must happend sometime! you have to be happy about your big wins !

There is div @ 1H TF.  
So I'll wait the upward movement.

Actually u are right. I entered the trade 1.2225 which actually touched the line it was a very fine line, and i decided to take the trade. Somehow the trade only got executed at 1.2232. But i am glad that what i saw was partially(mostly correct) i dun mind those pips. What i am looking for is the correct judgment which will eventually make us all successful. And I agree with Bbols, it all boils down to chances, the difference is just higher or lower chance. Thanks for the help. I definitely learnt a lot from the thread. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Here's what I saw regarding current EU situation.  
  
1\. There was a double-bottom setup and first entry possibility (early entry) was at the neckline break around 1.2212. I entered and got stopped out at BE.  
  
2\. After the price broke 50 EMA and started to retrace i drew my TL and waited for retracement with Stoch confirm (it retraced below 50). I was trying to enter on the break of IB @ 8:50 at 1.2220, got filled @ 1.2225 and got stopped out @ 1.2205. I wanted to re-enter on the break of IB @ 9:10, but didn't get filled.  
  
Regards,

Let, I find fib extensions to work well. But, overall, exit strategy is somewhat subjective.  
  
Once you're determined with your direction, use last retracement move as reference points for fib drawing. The least price does most of the time is 138.2% extension, so set it to be your first target. You can use other tools such as S/R lvls, whole numbers,   
  
Considering today's example: first target should've been around 1.2245 if you entered long.  
  
Snu.

Here's the pic I made myself with market phases as described on marketgauge. Plz study this, i hope you will find this useful. These are widely used on stock markets to define market sentiment, however i find them work just as well on forex.

Good morning!  
  
Here's Higher TF charts:  
  
Both 30M and 1H look quite bullish, but price has been consolidating for past few hours, it looks like there is retracement under way.

Hi Snusnufreak,   
  
This is a great looking system. I trade something along similar lines - essentially looking for a trendline break - BUT looking for that all important retracement - this gives me so much more confidence in a trade. Personally I look for a retracement to around the 9ema. I often find that price shoots up when it breaks a TL, then 'calms down' and pulls back - I like the 9ema - its almost as if this is the 'true price' of a currency pair, and price never strays to far from it.  
  
Attached is a pic of the sort of trade I take - didn't take this one, was tucked up in bed!  
  
I'll be taking a much closer look at this thread, and hoping to learn a few tricks!  
  
Cheers  
Andy

Andy, I'm glad you find this system useful! I'll be glad if you join in and start participating.   
  
I know that 9 EMA is widely used both on Stock markets and Forex. As the matter of fact here's another picture showing the application of so-called "MA-TRIO" - it describes how people use 10, 20 and 50 period EMA in conjunction with each other to find trends.  
  
Hope it helps!  
  
Regards,  
  
snu.  
  
**_Update:_** Attached is the indicator wich shows you an arrow when all 3 EMA's cross.

15M chart. Pretty nice H&S pattern.  
Gonna look for a short entry after retracing to the neckline.  
Any thoughts?

Yes, looks like valid H&S.  
  
There was an entry using hidden div on 5M around the 1.2285 area, unfortunately I was not near the PC. However, the major TL is broken only now, we will see if we have a retracement to it and a pullback entry.   
  
Here's the pic.

Guys, in my previous post I drew TL incorrectly, this way the entry can not be seen.  
  
The correct way to draw TL is use todays first extremum low and first Lower Low the price has formed (according to the pic).

This sounds like a nice idea. I will give it a thought over the weekend to see how to work it out.

Hey, thanks for that, very interesting! Yup, I'll try to drop by as much as I can.   
  
I think we're going to see a quiet morning until the news this afternoon hopefully gives us some direction. Should be an interesting afternoon's trading!

While the market is still quiet, I thought I'd post a chart of yesterday morning's 'failed breakout'.  
  
As I saw it, it would have been quite a risky trade to take. Price was very 'sticky' around the 62ema, which created additional confluence with the TL, and was reluctant to close below this level.  
  
The main driver for me passing on this trade, however, was that the R1 pivot was just 5-10 pips below the trendline. Personally, I like to take breakouts like this where there is a good 20-30 pips 'free run' before any potential S/R, or a round number.   
  
Just my 2 cents.

Ok! i'm hoping this goes well and won't distract anyone from the market! See you there on monday then!   
  
BTW, why today is a bad day? there were nice, almost textbook, setups to the downside.

Hi,   
  
I took exactly the same order  
however i did not manage to identify H & S  
Instead i took because price went above MA50 and MACD was above 0.   
Pls take a look at my trendlines and tell me if i draw it wrongly. Thanks

Hi,ALL...  
Let me clarify H&SH formation:  
1.Spike in Volume on the LSH  
2\. Divergence   
( between LSH and HEAD Left side of NECK - then mirrow  
Rignt side of NECK and RSH)  
...according to this - PA breaks LeftSideNeck = RightSideNeck then  
RE-Test = RSH  
  
indicators have to be used accordingly  
1\. stadart MACD in positive Zone  
2.PA > 50EMA   
3\. draw TL touching RSN = HH  
4\. IB, Fractal = HL = RSH  
please, correct me...

serguey, so according to this RSH should be always higher than LSH, could you plz clarify. The entry to the upside should be considered only now?

Hi everyone!  
  
I missed the initial entry this morning, but got in on a retrace. I got out at 1.1950 for around 20 pips -around the confluence of the 62ema on 5M, and the 23.6% fib retracement of Friday's move.  
  
Technicals showing nice MACD divergence on 15M, and my gut tells me we could see 1.2000 today (which would be the 38% fib retrace) but it would take a braver man than me to buy Euros in these market conditions!

Hi Snu - think we got out around the same time. To be honest, I'm happy to escape with any pips at all after a very choppy morning. What is the FS1 lvl that you mentioned?  
  
Yeah - round numbers and .xx50 - EURUSD really likes those levels, more than any other currency pair.

Sorry, i meant a fall, but looks like i am wrong.. I was thinking that once it falls below the trend line, I will look for an inside bar, a downward fractal, MACD below 0 and px <ma50.

In this post I'll try to explain H&S using todays entry example. Plz refer back to post #158:  
[http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&postcount=158](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3774204&postcount=158)  
  
After you've spotted the divergence its easy to identify Left Shoulder and the Head, the tricky part is identifying the Right Shoulder. Here's the rule for identification of right shoulder(according to the system).  
  
_The rule:_  
  
\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Right shoulder (Higher Low) forms **only after** we have Higher High, MACD turns to our side, 50 EMA is broken and price retraces back to it.  
\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
The pic in this post shows the right designation of H&S model.  
  
According to the H&S model target is calculated based on the distance between head and right shoulder. Most commonly used ratios are 50% of that range and 70% of taht range. See pic.  
  
As you can see, I entered when right side of the neck was forming, and thus had to wait out through the retracement which was the right shoulder formation.   
  
The correct entry after the right shoulder has been formed was at the same price lvl, but it **was in the correct place and time** \- after the inside bar, as shown on the picture.  
  
Regards,  
  
snu.

Whilst the overall trend is clearly down, I still think we might see a retest of today's highs, with 1.2000 being hit. Interestingly, price bounced off the TL, which was also at the 200ema on 5M. Unfortunately I was away from my desk, so will wait for a retrace, if any.

Morning all,  
  
Any thoughts of where we're heading today? Price is hemmed in by an acsending triangle, and R1 and the daily pivot. I think once we clear those, we might see a big move, especially after the relatively low volatility yesterday.  
  
My feeling is that we'll head to the upside - but you can't trade a feeling!

Sunseeker, my scenario still remains from yesterday. On higher TF i consider this movement to be the retracement. First target using fibonacci retracements is 1.2005. If I see setup there on 5M TF I'll be entering it with no doubt!

UPD - close half at +25.  
SL at BE.  
Decided to move TP for the other half at 1.1880 cause 15M chart TL is also broken. Now just watching...

My analisys.  
1H TF there is the fractal to move up, so this is retracement, after TL broken down, and we must wait 2nd fractal - end of retracement.  
5 Min TF retracement 50 EMA, IB.  
My target - 1,1880 Fib + KG sup.  
Anybody see the same?

Pls advice.

Des, your trades are all according to the system, except for last one. There are several things to note here.  
  
1\. 1H TF reached the retracement target of 1.2005 (see my posts) - EU had little space to go further.  
2\. Semafor showed good local extremum, and before entering to the upside it would be a good Idea to wait for an extremum at the bottom (represented by the "sun")  
3\. Not our timing.  
  
Regards,  
snu.

EU reached first retracement lvl @ 1.2005 yesterday.  
1H looks bearish to me. Any thoughts?

Maybe. But at the moment that trendline on 1H is providing a fair amount of support.  
  
In the short term, I think if price breaks above 1.1960, the daily pivot, we'll definitely see a retest of yesterdays high, and on up to R1.  
  
TWT!

Actually entry was around 1.1947. The formation looks like H&S, with A-B-C in right shoulder, according to it target is @ 1.2020 (70% of distance between head and RSH). Unfortunately I missed it.

Good call Sergey - did you catch the whole move? Bizarre, if you took a mirror and placed it at the daily high, around 7.20pm on a 5M chart, price has completely reversed, almost bar by bar, in an identical way as it rose...

i'm waiting for Inverse H&SH Formation on the level 1.1975-1.1950 with  
Upside move - TP-1 to-day's HIGH , TP-2 - to-day HIGH +2338%  
  
if PA break 1.1930 it'll be another scenario....

Yup, I'd agree with that analysis. Price is currently sitting on the 200ema on the 15M, deciding where to go.. but i also think a move south might be in order...  
  
Should be an interesting day tomorrow......

I'm expecting price to retrace to one of the lvls drawn on the picture (common fib ratios) and go on further up according to the scenario I've previously posted.  
However, if price for any reason will break the lower TL I'll be considering the move to the downside. Its also possible that we won't have that big of a pullback, then I'll wait for price to reach the 1.2100 area and look for shorts there.  
  
Regards,  
snu.

Morning All,  
  
I agree with Snu, I think we'll see some good trading opportunities. Charts are looking nice and clean. I still favour the upside. There are lots of little 'attractions' for price to visit - R2 at 1.2137, 62ema on 4H at 1.2125, and a nice level of resistance at around 1.2150, also a half/round number. All to play for! I'd like to see a meaningful retracement first, though, before taking any longs.   
  
Let's see what happens!

Point B moved a bit higher, I'm still anticipating the retracement. Possible lvls are shown on the picture.   
  
I also use different semafor values. the "sun" on the picture hase value of 170 in the indicator parameters, which tells me that we're approaching a strong extremum. This + the local divergence tells me that most likely the point 1.2062 is the correct point B. Now we're waiting for point C to form.

snu.

Here is H&S model.  
Can we consider this as right shoulder?  
Anyway, gonna wait for 50th EMA breakout and re-testing to entry.  
Early entry is also possible.

With all this fuss about playing retracements we missed a good entry to the upside. Now have to wait for a pullback. Very annoying and not effective at all, since i was expecting the move all morning.

Hi there I am interested does anyone scale out of their position ??  
I have been lately exiting my trade in 3 or 4 increments, 8,16 and 20 pips each with BE at 10 pips and finding that it is working quite well for me. not as profitable as full 20 pips but nice to bag some profit along the way?

Exactly! I also got caught up in the chop. Luckily came to my senses in time to snatch 20 pips on a minor retrace from 1.2045 to the daily high, to make up for my earlier stupidity.  
  
I agree, now we have to wait for another pullback.....

According to the model  
  
We see wave "C in wave C in wave C" forming if it plays out it is going to be an impulse move I suppose. I'm still holding my position.

Its important that you understand the difference between setup and the model.  
  
**Setups** stay unchanged and are being conducted using rules described in this thread.   
  
**The model** is the representation of the market which helps us to determine which setups to take and allows us to calculate possible targets.  
  
My previous post showed the model. Now since we consider market to go up you play setups from points C.  
  
at first point C (1.1956) there was a H&S setup  
at second point C (1.2008) there was a 2B setup  
right now at current point C looks like there is 2B setup (or possibly double bottom) forming as well.

Hey pip.  
I think there is 2B pattern @ 15M TF: EP 1.2065 SL 1.2086 TP 1.2026  
5M TF there is H&S with same profit @ 1.2026.   
Isn't it?

Good Morning!  
  
Here's current EU situation, as I see it.  
  
PA looks like H&S formation. We can see divergence in volume and on MACD as well.  
  
I've drawn possible targets for point C using fib retracements and ABCD model. (Look at horizontal blue lines on the picture)  
  
The most reasonable target to me seems the 1.2052 line since this lvl coinsides with the 70% distance between head and right shoulder.  
  
If price breaks and retests lower TL I'll be looking for shorts with target around 1.2050.  
  
I'll consider market to the upside only if 1.2150 lvl is broken and retested (previous extremum)  
  
Regards,  
  
snu.

BTW, the extremum at point 1.2148 is shown even if I use settings of 500 on semafor, this tells me its a very strong point and we should expect a deeper pullback.

Here is 15M and 5M charts.  
TL looks finally broken.  
I missed 2B entry at 1.2114, so decided to enter short after IB formed at 1.2100.  
SL 20 pips, target is near 1.2050. Keeping in mind, that major bias is upside, so it's just a correction move. Shoudn't be too greedy anyway=)

Good morning, traders!  
  
Looks like scenario, I've drawn on friday is on its way.(first pic)  
  
Here's the pic for todays possibilities.  
  
I'm long biased in mind. So I'll wait for the price to retrace to one of the lvls and then look for setups there. However if price breaks lower TL (green line) and retests it I will be looking for shorts.  
  
Regards,  
  
snu.

Here are possibilities of todays' trades and explanation of how the analysis should've been conducted.  
  
1\. We spotted yesterdays low and todays high as our reference points A and B  
  
2\. We used 4H intervals to find extremum points for plotting different scenarios and thus different sets of lvls for identification of point C.   
  
In this particular case (see the pic) we used lowest points from different 4H intervals as our reference point A. As you can see the one which worked out was the lowest point from todays first 4H @ 1.2106. This point and point B @ 1.2206 gave us point C @ 1.2262 (using fib ratios). As you can see price reached that lvl. Target (point D) according to these three points was @ 1.2253.  
  
3\. We looked for price formations @ point C. Our template and indicators showed us H&S formation with fakeout on right shoulder (see pic). Target using ABCD model should've been 1.2250.  
  
4\. As you can see our initial ABCD model worked itself out. Now we start looking for new ABCD models, since we consider the trend to go up. Third pic shows the designation and possible retracement lvls for it (using fib ratios). As you can see lvl 1.2221 worked out, thus our target is 1.2303.  
  
5\. Price formation at point C gave us hidden divergence and our pullback entry setup. You could've entered right away using 2B pattern or on the break of second TL (after IB and fractal formation).   
  
I tried to show here in what manner we should work every day.  
Plz fell free to give feedback and ask questions.  
  
Regards,  
snu.

Good Morning!  
  
Here's EU as I see it.   
  
I took two points as reference A-points to calculate A-B-C retracements.  
Retracements for point 1.2048 are marked in red horizontal lines.   
Retracements for point 1.2162 are marked in blue horizontal lines.  
Thick solid blue line is where lvls from these two points coincide.  
  
Pic 2. Shows possible H&S formation on the lvl. I'll be looking for longs, if neckline is broken and then retested.   
  
If price goes down more I'll be watching for setups to form on lower lvls (per pic 1)

snu.

I missed early entry opportunity @ 1.2195  
  
Now HH is forming, will wait for a decent pullback and enter from right shoulder and new point C.

in the morning we have H&SH formation - then FALSE breakdown - this false move usually means fast-flowing move...-ab- will be straight line...

Now on Upside move ( point -b-) there is a Divergence = it means PULLBACK ( and I can start do Fibo calculation)....

Yes, Serguey, thank you for pointing this out!   
  
We should start designating models (putting points A and B on graph and calculate possible lvls for point C) **only after we spot a local divergence**. Only in this case we can assume that price will retrace from this point and thus a valid point C will form.   
  
Use stochastics and CCI indicators for spotting local divergence (watch Serguey's posts).

snu.

I' still expecting a deeper pullback since current leg up looks like a 5 wave pattern with divergence forming between wave 3 and 5. Please also note the divergence within wave 3.

Good morning!  
  
First pic shows target according to the ABCD model we considered yesterday that was not reached.  
  
Second pic showes possible retracement lvls if we consider different swing lows (Points A) from yesterdays up move and the high @ 1.2348 (point B)  
  
Third pic showes H&S formation and an EP which should've been taken an hour ago. Right Now possible re-entry is forming.  
  
Regards,  
snu.

We had double top setup with break of the neckline and pullback to retest it.  
  
Right now i'm waiting for a break of TL, fractal, IB and I'll enter short.  
  
Initial target is 1.2250, if its broken I'll consider price to reach the 1.2210-1.2220 area.

Red TL is drawn using local fractals.  
  
My order is in place - right below the TL and IB @ 1.2285. Target is 1.2220

We reached one of the possible lvls for point C formation according to our current ABCD model (blue labels).   
  
I see two scenarios:  
  
1\. If price breaks and retests TL shown on the picture, I'll be looking for shorts with targets around 1.2220 as previously stated.  
  
2\. If price forms H&S pattern to the upside and gives me a valid entry I will be entering long with target around 1.2450.

Here's a picture of long setup on EU. Everything according to the rules descrbed in post 1.  
  
I didn't enter because of hesitation.   
Now I would like to see a pullback with stoch going below 50, this will provide me with additional entry to the upside.

Thx bbolss.  
  
Check out post #292 and #294, it is identical situation. i was looking at the divergence on MACD and missed my entry to the upside.   
  
I talked to serguey and he explained that divergence should be looked for only when price reaches one of the important lvls according to the model you're playing.

Here is 1H and 5M charts.  
1H: 50% fibo retrace with doublebottom formation and TL bounce.  
5M: TL is broken. Waiting for retrace to the TL to enter long.

Closed the other half at +132.  
  
Cause price riched the first target - 138.2% fibo extention from the correction move.  
  
Now I expect correction retracement after such a great move with valid setup created to enter long again![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1).  
  
Good luck, fellows!

Eu pic shows that target is reached. Both ABCD models worked out their lvls.  
  
The formation looks like double top. I'll be looking for shorts as soon as I spot a setup to the downside.

There is div on 30M chart(1st pic). If we consider marked area as an upside move, why cant we draw TL like this?  
  
Also on 5M chart (2nd pic) div is formed.  
I entered short according to 2B-pattern rules at 1.2403.  
  
What is ur view?

Your 2B pattern is wrong:  
  
1\. The bar didn't close above previous high.  
2\. We only consider 2B pattern on Right shoulder.  
  
Your entry is correct, i guess.  
  
We had TLB + retrace and fakeout to the upside. If you saw that then your EP is justified.

Do not forget about major TL. 4H shows nice support area, so I expect this TL is gonna be broken, wich means even greater move down.

Look. We have fake major TL breakout - 1H chart. Price gonna run down after real one.  
5M - price's retesting this TL (lower red line on chart).  
I consider downtrend as long as TL (higher red line on chart) works as support.  
Adding some short positions? - may be....

Hi. traders!  
  
Was busy today so posting only now.  
  
Eat_my_shorts, good analisys indeed, keep it up!  
  
Just wanted to correct you a bit regarding 1H TF: The TL is actually broken (drow it precisely using lows of the bars) and we have setup forming according to the system: Now we have to wait for the fractal and IB and enter short according to the 1H TF.  
  
The pic is attached.  
  
Regards,  
snu.

SL hit, I was too greedy at all=)  
Should closed at least half of total position at 1.2352 as it's strong resist lvl.  
But I am still in tread. Will see, what US traders are gonna do.

Break of lower TL - Short  
Break of upper TL - Long (IB + fractal prior to that)  
  
But I think its enough for today anyways. Best entries always happen during Frankfurt/London session. US does some weird stuff most of the time.

Good morning, traders!  
  
Pic.1 shows possible scenarios. Looks like one of them worked itself out so I expect the retracement to the upside.   
Pic.2 showes divergence and possible setup forming to the upside.

Morning.  
Major TL was absolutely broken yesterday. Now i expect re-testing retrace to it. Especially there is MACD div even on 1H TF.  
5M shows doblebottom formation. So let's wait for the long trade opportunity.

Sl 20 pips as usual. First targert - 1.2352 as strong S/R lvl.  
Second targert - 61.8% fibo retrace 1.2394. I'm already in. Will see.....

Moved SL 5 pips below to stay in trade. We have KG lvl works as support at 1.23035. Price also bounced 61.8% fibo retrace lvl. Hope it'll work out

Eat_My_short, there are several aspects regarding your entry that are worth mentioning.  
  
1\. Technically, your entry is absolutely correct. But allways remember that you have to lead your trade. I've marked the bar on the pic which broke 3 EMA's at once - this is **very strong local reversal signal.** You should've exited your trade right after that bar and not waited for your SL.  
  
2\. Also, make thorougher analysis and decide if its safe to enter early. In this case I personally would've waited for the break of 200 EMA and retest since we have nice fib cluster there according to 5M TF.  
  
Current situation as I see it:  
  
Since we finally broke the low, I expect the market to go further down.  
According to 1H TF I would suspect it testing or breaking the Neck LVL @ 1.2250 after which we would have a nice retracement with right shoulder formation and opportunity to go long on 5M TF. We shall see.

Target of 1.2286 reached according to ABCD model marked with red lines.  
  
Neckline is broken and retested. I put buy limit @ 1.2270 (point C according to bigger ABCD model, marked in green lines on pic) but didn't get filled.  
  
Target according to "green" ABCD model is 1.2305

GJ, bbolss!  
  
Its nice that we see same situations on the market using different analisys. I entered at the same point as you did and had 45 stressful minutes as well, but the right thing to do was to wait for the neckline break and retest.   
  
We should try to train ourselves to catch impulse moves right before they happen instead of waiting out through the pullbacks. Understanding H&S model and waiting for the _**break of neckline and retrace**_ will help us do that!  
  
Check out the picture with explanation of correct entry point! I post this partialy for myself since I'm also having troubles entering the market at the correct place and time.   
  
Regards,  
snu.

Well, you never know anything for sure on forex, however its up to you to either follow some strict and predefined set of rules or enter market using some other stuff including one's own prejudices.   
  
In my previous post I tried to explain how its done by professionals who write books on technical analysis: Don't enter on the break of anything, allways wait for retest! Its up to you if you accept this approach or not.

snu

Good morning, guys.  
EU watch:  
Look at 1H chart. Price reached very strong S/R lvl 1.2351, Price bounced from this lvl for several times. So I expect move down.  
5M : H&SHS model is forming, nice div on MACD. After Londons open will search for a setup to go short.

I entered into smaller H&SHS model after breaking and retesting TL after IB at 1.2335 with 20 pips SL.  
Main Goal according to ABCD model is near 1.2110.  
Now price's retesting the neckline. May be there will be formed re-entry setup for those of us, who missed early entry. Regards

SL moved at BE, cause price may be pumped further up before the final run down

Priced was stopped for several bars at 61.8% fiboretrace lvl.  
But I am still in, cause there is no MACD divergence to be worried about.  
I will stay short until divergence is formed.  
As pro's says, "Stay in a trade from the divergence until next divergence" ;-)  
So I expect only tiny pullback to the one of the EMA's.

Forgot to mention.  
Very nice hidden Div is forming on Stoch, wich prove my suggestion about trend continuation. So, we are all gonna look for a trend cont. setup to entry, but i'll skip it, I suppose, cause leading different orders on the same pair is to difficult for me.

This is pretty confusing. Looks like possible H&SHS are forming to provide much deeper pullback. I will close short after the break of the neckline to temporary buy for about 20 pips and then re-enter short. Let as usual the market to decide=)

1\. Double Divergence = between LSH and Head - if You want to play here - use caculation correct cluster level - entry 2B Pattern... this entry means Right Side of Neck.... 2. Triple (Quadriple) Divergence = between LSH and RSH ( or 2-nd RSH) in this case You play standart Head&Shoulder Pattern - here You can use two kind of entries -a. according to the strict RULES - Break of Neck Line - Re-Test..... b. using abcd formation inside RSH = a little bit earlier....

15 pips SL hit. I huriied. S/R KG lvl wasn't actually broken. Now we have 2B pattern for sure in the right shoulder provides entry at 1.2280. Price also may form doble bottom before upside move. Of course, there also may not be any upside move, who knows=)

Good morning!  
  
I see two scenarios currently developing on EU on 5M. See pic 1 plz. Targets for both are not yet reached, so I expect EU to go higher. This would coincide with the end of development of Right shoulder on 1H TF (pic 2) and give me a nice, long-term entry to the downside.  
However I consider another possibility: If price breaks lower TL of RSH (see pic 2) and holds below it, I will consider EU to the downside and will look for short setups.  
  
Right now the situation looks like there is a double bottom formation.

Picture shows EU setup:  
  
1\. Divergence on MACD.  
2\. MACD > 0.  
3\. 50 EMA and initial TL broken.  
4\. Fractal and IB formed.  
  
Understand that this is the entry into the right side of neck, so know your target well. **Read Serguey's posts from yesterday!**  
  
I expect price to break the neckline, retest it, forming A-B-C. I will enter from point C.

I got my expected scenario - price retraced to the expected lvl, but there was no setup to the upside: lower MACD was below zero and never came back to the upside, plus trendline was never broken.  
  
I entered after an IB @ 1.2335 and got my SL hit @ -20 pips.

Good morning!  
  
EU looks like there is H&S forming to the downside. I will wait for neckline break and retest wich will give me point C of my ABCD scenario.  
  
Take a look at pictures.

We have divergence on EU between ystd's and today's lows. I will wait for the setup to the upside with the target around 1.2300 (38 retracement of ytd's move + 600 EMA + whole number). If price breaks below 1.2250 and canceles out the divergence I'll be considering market to the downside with the target around 1.2200

EU went down without any clear setups to the downside.  
  
Right now according to the 30M TF it looks like we've almost reached the potential reversal zone around 1.2215-1.2200 area.   
  
We have Previous week low there, mmline, 261,8 fib extension and also a whole number 1.2200. Looks like a very strong lvl to me and we definitely should have a bounce from it at least to 50% of the whole down leg.

Use Navigation menu and select MACD indicator from the list of standard indicators. Also read help menu if you experiencing troubles with MT4, everything is explained there.

Thanks for the useful information and keeping things simple. Followed price action and plotted 2 trendlines since im good with spotting them, noticed resistance at the top and missed the first bounce down, the second attempt to break the top trendline pretty much failed and showed resistance and ended with a Pinbar, i took a short, managed my stops and made some profit.  
  
In with +20 and the rest is riding by itself. Hope I can carry on spotting these trades and just pulling these triggers now. Been messing with lots of systems for too long, hope I can make steady profits now.  
  
Cheers bud, screen attached of my rough entry.

Hi Snu. Thanks for this perfect thread. Really useful. I've learned many things here.  
I noticed the HS formation yesterday while watching Portugal vs Spain, but a valid trade signal did not come. Just one question. How did you find HS profit target? Is it 70% of Head / Neckline distance mentioned some time ago? Thx.

Yeap. I was short from 20:25 (1,2251) till 21:30 (1,2237). I quit the trade with +14pips as it seemed that the strong S/R lvl at aprox 1,2235 wil not be broken.

My today entry and analisys:  
1\. @ 30 M TF we can see xABCD scenario, what show us direction  
2\. @ 5 M TF we also can see xABCD scenario

So my first entry:  
EP: 1,2220  
SL: 1,2210  
TP: 1,2240  
Closed @ BE, but this is erly entry, because there is not left shoulder, and not formed B & C points

Hope you guys were smart enough to short the Euro after a long move up, some nice money to be made on the retracement going down.  
  
Wanna milk these pips like a b*tch next week. Oh, and if im not wrong, i had a trendline break on the m15 stoch? while it also crossed to the downside, that was a good hint that the retracement was ready to start.  
  
Interesting week for sure. Have a good weekend guys, hope we can all make some good money next week.

Infact, forget being a wussy, Im going to wait for a retracement south hopefully on GBPUSD, and If i get the setup im looking for I'll short that and milk some pips from that too. Why let the money just run away? Spent 2 damn years letting all my signals just fly by on screen, time to take them and make that money back now.  
  
After a long move up, even GU will be coming down sometime. Might as well take another trade seeing as tomorrow will be much more volatile and risky to trade ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Took another stab at the Euro since I know what to look for now in the countertrends in one of my other charts, just took another quick 12-14pips or so. Shorted from around 54 ish on the Euro down to 38 ish.  
  
Gosh i love these late post london session trades. I think im not going to bother posting charts or any more posts in this thread or anywhere else and just stick to making pips next week and get heaps of practice before I lose focus again.  
  
Thanks once again to the thread opener for some nice info here, you've been a positive influence to help me making pips finally. Cheers and happy trading ya'all.

30M looks like xABCD has developed (check out fib lvls)  
  
5M looks like double top is forming with the neckline around 1.2480 area.  
  
For short entry I would like to see MACD < 0, break and retest of neckline with IB and fractal formation on the return move.  
  
For long entry I would like to see price break previous high and retest it.  
  
So basically: short below 1.2480, loong above 1.2540  
  
Regards,  
snu

Hi, traders!  
  
Here's my EU vision for today!  
Break and retest of lower TL = down  
Break and retest of upper Tl = Up  
  
I favor upside, since we have divergence and 5 wave pattern to the downside. But we shall see what market will do.  
  
Regrads,  
snu.

Hello, traders!  
  
We had a nice run up yesterday. I consider this leg to be an XA move with price currently forming the BC leg, I expect the retrace up to 1,2630 area and then run down. So right now I will be looking for long setups and later on I will be looking for shorts!  
  
Again, this is only one of the possible scenarios, price can do whatever, so lets watch and play it according to the setups.  
  
Regards,  
snu.

EU H&S model per 5M TF.  
  
We have tripple divergence (between head and left shoulder and between shoulders as well.)  
  
Target according to the model is around 1.2630 area.  
  
EP - on the break of triangle in right shoulder @ 1.2590.

Hello, fellow traders! We had couple of nice possibilities yesterday, sorry I was not posting them right away - I got lazy. They're explained on pics 1 and 2.  
  
Pic 3 shows EU for today: currently I do not see any setups or patterns, so I do nothing. I wait for price break out from both the triangle and trading range and then I'll look for setup possibilities.   
  
Notice how we're currently in a trading range bettween right shoulder and left neck. Moves happen when we break out from it. While in it, depending on its width, you could scalp on lower TF (2 or 3 min), so remember allways to set range boundaries for yourself at the beginning of each trading day. This will help you know if you're in a trend or in a sideways movement.  
  
Regards,  
  
snu

1\. 15M MACD turned to negative territory - start analizing market!  
  
15M TF: We reached the trendline so the move up is possible - **In order for me to go long I would like to see PA form local reversal model on 5M (inverse H &S or double bottom), then I'll wait for break of 50 EMA and neckline, retest and entry to the upside.**  
  
5M TF: H&S is developing. Neckline is at the pivot and got broken, **I Will wait for right shoulder formation and enter short if I get a setup to the downside later on. I will wait for semafor on 5M TF at the top.**  
  
1H TF: Price action looks like we're about to begin wave 4 decline, targets are 38% and 50% fib of wave 3. Nice divergence has formed on MACD plus we reached strong S&R lvl around 1.2700 area.

Hello, traders!  
  
Here are some setups I had today.  
  
1\. This one was during asia but I still took it since expected EU to go down starting friday (1H TF gave me a signal to the downside). Pic showes the setup. I got out manually with 38 pips as soon as woke up.  
  
2\. Almost identical pullback setup. Got out with +15.  
  
Regards,  
snu.

Out with +10, since 1.2587 looks like good Resistance lvl.

Looks like H&S within bigger H&S. More up movement?

I like your first pullback system. It's simple and very profitable. This is very similar to how Chicago Floor Traders trade. In a trending market, buy the dips and sell the rallies.  
  
The first pullback system is the best!!! In a trending market I buy/sell when stochs are overbought/oversold according to direction (it doesn't happen often for the stochs to stay overbought or oversold in a trending market ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)).   
  
I also use sweetspot indicators that basically show the psychological levels of 0,25,50,75,100.  
  
Nothing wrong with this system, but there is just too much checking for this and that for me. Your first system is the best and thanks for sharing it. It's going to get me my first Ferrari ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1) Yay!!!
