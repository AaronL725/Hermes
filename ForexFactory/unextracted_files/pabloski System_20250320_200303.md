I have been studying the fascinating world of FOREX for more than two years and ForexFactory was one of the first places were I found valuable help and information. I usually spend all of my time in this forum reading and learning, so I think now is the time to share.  
I have created and tested many many systems during all this months and finally there is one it seems to generate regular profits for me. I have only tested it on GBP/JPY. I have fund that H4 is the best timeframe to spot firm trends and reasonably early. We know that trends in GBP/JPY are strong and prolonged, but it's not that easy to recognize its beginnings and the right time to exit. I'm sure this system should work with other pairs with the right adjustments if needed, as each pair has its own personality.  
TPs and SLs for this system are “dynamic”, as I called them, because they change according to the indicators used. You will understand what I mean once you read the logics. At first it may look a bit complex, but soon you will realize it's easy to follow and understand. Of course, charts with examples will finally give you the full picture.  
  
Ok, let's start. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
  
This system uses two visible indicators: ATR Channels and StepChoppyBars v1.1, which needs to work properly StepMA v7 and StepRSI v5.2 indicators.  
StepChoppyBars is a great indicator created by Igorad from Forex-TSD.com forum. Legend for StepChoppyBars indicator is the following:  
Blue: Strong UpTrend.  
DodgerBlue: Retrace UpTrend  
LightBlue: Choppy UpTrend  
Aqua: Be ready to change UpTrend  
Red: Strong DownTrend  
Tomato: Retrace DownTrend  
Orange: Choppy DownTrend  
Yellow: Be ready to change DownTrend  
  
Buy & Close-Buy Logics  
Buy three equal positions when a candle closes between Lime ATR Centre Line and Aqua ATR Line, Step Choppy Bars candle is blue and previous Step Choppy Bar candle is Blue or Yellow. SL for the three opened positions is a candle closing below Yellow ATR line.  
TP for the first position is a candle closing above Aqua ATR line. Once this TP is reached, the SL of the two remaining open positions will be moved to breakeven. TP for the second position is a candle closing above DodgerBlue ATR line. Once this TP is reached, the SL of the remaining open position will be a candle close below Aqua ATR line. If trend continues and price “touches” Blue ATR line, SL of this last position will be now a candle closing below DodgerBlue ATR line. This last position will remain opened till SL is triggered or a candle is painted Aqua.  
Note: In the case a candle is painted Red, Tomato, Orange or Yellow during any time of the process, all positions should be closed.  
  
Sell & Close-Sell Logics  
Sell three equal positions when a candle closes between ATR Lime centre line and ATR Yellow line, Step Choppy Bars candle is red and previous Step Choppy Bar candle is Red or Aqua. Initial SL for the three opened positions is a candle closing above Aqua ATR line.  
TP for the first position is a candle closing below Yellow ATR line. Once this TP is reached, the SL of the two remaining open positions will be moved to breakeven. TP for the second position is when a candle closing below Orange ATR line. Once this TP is reached, the SL of the remaining open position will be a candle closing above Yellow ATR line. If trend continues and price “touches” Red ATR line, SL of the last opened position will be now a candle closing above Orange ATR line. This last position will remain opened till SL is triggered or a candle is painted Yellow.  
Note: In the case a candle is painted Blue, DodgerBlue, LightBlue or Aqua during any time of the process, all positions should be closed.  
  
Note: If we see a sell opportunity but the candle is closing between Yellow and Orange lines (instead between Lime and Yellow lines), **very close to yellow line** , you may:  
\- Open three positions, apply the TPs and SLs for the 2nd and 3rd positions as usual and use the same TPs and SLs than the 2nd position for the 1st position.  
\- Open two positions, ignoring the 1st one and applying TPs and SLs for the 2nd and 3rd positions as usual.  
The same logic applies to a buy opportunity, but doesn't happen frequently.  
  
When taking a position, always wait for the candle to close. A possible variation would be opening only one position and moving the SLs accordingly.  
  
What I like about this system is that it generally gives accurate signals and if not, will tell you to exit early avoiding big losses. Also, it's very likely that for not so prolonged trends at least the first TP will be reached, so you will generally exit happy with profits. The system requires attention but not so much, it's enough to take a look at the chart every 4 hours to see how the candle is closing.   
  
Of course, always test every system before risking real money. This is open to modifications and improvements, fell free to comment! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

your system looks very promising , i'm using something like your sytem too, but its called braintrading system in the same timefraims, i got a question for you regarding your system, how would you avoid this sell order that accordingly to your system had to be made on the chart ?

I would be interested writing an expert on this system. But don't hold your breath, it might take a while, as I am doing some other projects as well.  
  
btw, vitaliy did you know you can increase your chart workspace by reducing number of buttons on toolbars and moving them all into one line on top.

yeah, i was just too lazy to do it =) mmmm this system looks pretty good the only problem that I see with it that it has quite few cases that I pointed out, if to assume that you get 3 orders loses are going to be huge .... I tried to combine this system with braintrading and some more indicators. I found that braintrading indicators show trend earlier that in Pabloski System, so eventhough if the trend changes direction you will have at least few pips in + .... Also i tried to make EA for BT, but unforunatly I did practice for a long time and I forgot everything and my EA was full of bugs which I couldn't even find.

Thanks for sharing your system. You said you were using two visible indicators, then what about the other two indicators you attached, Step RSI and Step MA? Are you using them in any way, for filtering/confirmation etc.?

"which needs to work properly StepMA v7 and StepRSI v5.2 indicators."**  
  
They are there so the other indicator can work.

I believe that is the recent dip on H4 GBPJPY  
  
According to his rules, that sell would of reached the 1st take profit, and the other 2 positions would of been moved to break even  
  
so it still would of been a profitable trade.

I must say, that I am impressed by the indicator you use, namely the StepChoppyBars. It is fascinating how precisly it can find trend. However it slightly repaints but nothing to worry about if used for identifying trend. I would use this indicator for spoting trend on higher timeframes and tradint on lower.

first: thank you very much for posting your strategy, you won't regret it! Normally a great discussion is formed whenever someone posts a method like this ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1).  
  
And Vitaliy: You can also disable your open trades and results by clicking on the corresponding button in the topmost symbol toolbar or double-click on "terminal" so the thing gets very little - only one line so you just have to paint one line black ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

aha you would take profit on the first order but the other two would be negative orders because the price at which you would make the order is far below the green line, so on the other two orders you would lose around 80 pips on each one because your SL price is at the green line right ? so profit from the first order wouldn't cover your loses from other two, or I missunderstood the rules ?  
  
P.S. also at 02.09 at 12:00 check this candle out ... the SL would be hit without even closing the first order and than it drops down again ... any ideas how to avoid it ?

Make your picture bigger, because I think you are missing an entry...  
  
You would actually enter the trade sooner than you are thinking...on my chart, i have a red candle entry the one before that long candle... soo all three trades would of been profitable  
  
and understand...once you close your first position...you are suppose to move the other two stops to BREAK EVEN so you wouldn't be at a loss when the trade closed.

Here this should make it clearer  
  
  
And actually when the yellow bar appears you are suppose to close all trades....you would of actually been in 14 pips profit on that trade....that is if the indicator doesnt repaint itself

Thank you for sharing your method, it looks great and would love to try it. For some reason I am not getting the Red, blue, etc bars on my candles, please see attached snap shot. I attached all 4 indicaters to my chart, is there something missing that I need to load for this to work? Thanks for the help and support.

That would end up being a loss, because later on down the road it eventually closes above the aqua line before going below the orange line...but think of it like this  
  
  
If your trade went over a 100 pips in profit before hitting your stop...would you let it go into a loss?

**" This system uses two visible indicators: ATR Channels and StepChoppyBars v1.1,"**  
  
  
You only need to have the ATR Channels and the StepChoppyBars on your chart, the other two indicators only need to be in your indicator folder for the StepChoppyBars to work...

You need to load other step... indicators in the first post choppybars uses them internally.

If you copied and compiled the 4 indicators, it should work. You only need to attach ATR Channels and StepChoppyBars to the chart only. The other two are not necessary, but you may attach them if you want.  
  
Tell me if your problem was solved.

Hi Irusoh, thank you for you input. Im afraid there is one little correction to make. Everything is ok in you count except this short position:

First, you should go short at 12:00, because at 8:00 previous candle is not painted red or aqua. Second, the position never reached SL because a candle never closes above Aqua Line. If you read the logics, SL is a candle closing above Aqua Line (not touching aqua line).  
  
According to my count, results for that position are:  
  
Sell @ 236.56 - 12:00  
First TP @ 235.76  
SL (breakeven) reached @ 236.53 for 2nd and 3rd position.  
Total Pips: 69  
  
Please see chart attached.

later on there is the same crazy whipsaw and the first bar closes between lime and yellow line ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) also, I saw in history when uptrend starts at red line than goes to orange and yellow ... mmmmm I'm thinking about combining two systems braintrading and pabloski , and see what it will give me as result

You are right about the close I missed that. My long candle prior to entry is red maybe because of time difference with diff dealers (I used velocity in this chart)  
  
Well if that's the case the whole thing could be in 1000 pips gain overall.

small coment on this one   
short 2.9 08:00 236.59 t/p 2.13 12:00 235.67 profit 92-9=83  
isn't it would be a losing position because at 02.12 at 00:00 the candle touches an aqua line ? or where the SL point would be ?  
  
  
OOOOOHHHHH I SEE ON YOUR GRAPH NOW, but if you would have your SL point set up for the aqua line it would hit it, so here we wouldn't set up SL on the order, instead we would have to watch it .

I guess you wait for candle close.

This is a great system ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) thnx to those people who could defend it from my criticizing ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) but to make three orders and not to go down on those parts that i pointed out on the charts you need pretty big balance to cover these swings ....  
  
100 pip jump back x 3 = 300 , so its pretty significant number ...

True, but I think that if you open three positions, you should divide your usual lot size by 3. For example, if you usually open 0.1 lot, then open three position of 3 microlots. If you usually open 1 lot, then open three positions of 0.3 lots, etc. This is how you can manage your risk.  
As I said in the 1st post, you may also open only one position and let it ride moving only SLs (or choosing the TP you wish).  
Everthing can be adapted to fit your needs.

Try with a fresh new installation of MT4. Copy ALL the indicators to experts/indicators folder and then compile them.  
Let me know if it worked.

When you go to save both the StepMa and the StepRsi see if there is a [1] at the end of the filename. If there is then remove the [1] that is part of the file name and save without the [1] that way the Stepchoppybars will recognize these indicators.

I have copied all four indicators as instructed and I have different colours for the same period mentioned below. Check out 2/2 08:00 and 12:00 bars, they are blue on my chart, not yellow. Can anyone tell me why? Does it differ because of different servers? I am using Alpari. Or does this indicator repaint?  
Thanks.

I have downloaded these indicators on mt4 from STS Finance this time and it gives completely different colours compared to yours and Alpari. This means users should be aware of different outcomes with different mt4 servers.

Looks promising on GBPJPY because it is the most trending pair. And re. luck, I believe everyone will get different backtest and forward test results with different mt4 platforms, therefore one should stick to the platform he/she backtests this strategy.

If you divide your usual lot size by 3 to manage risk, this means you are cutting your reward as well which keeps your risk/reward ratio the same.  
  
The logic behind your strategy is consistent, but SL will be a problem if all three positions are stopped before hitting the first TP. My Alpari platform shows a Long entry 03/29 @ 231.52 with three lots. At that moment, yellow ATR line is @ 229.7991. If the price closes below this level, let's say 229.78, we will be stopped out with the minimum loss of -174 pips x 3 = -522 pips.   
  
If the position is opened towards Aqua ATR line (for longs) and stopped out towards Orange ATR line due to using the closing price only, there is always the risk of higher SL amounts. As a result, you'll need high winning ratio to overcome this SL issue as well as long and strong trending prices to exit the third lot at a considerable profit to improve overall risk/reward ratio of this system.  
  
Thanks for sharing your system.

the winning ration is good i think ... I chacked the history and I could find a single time when it failed ... sometimes it goes -100 pips against you but after 2-3 bars comes down, check my previous posts where I placed screen shot with the worst time in the history for 2007 H4  
  
actually for 2007 i see only one losing position at 01.30 at 00:00

Fxhermit,thanks for your help and support, the problem was resolved and it was exactly as you described it, the [1] in the file name.  
  
Pabloski, thanks for your guidance, I did not need to reinstall MT4 platform again, it turnd to be a file name conflict as Fxhermit described it.

Great, I didnt know about this version. StepMA_v7.mq4 I attached is actually version 7.1. I changed the name simply because StepChoppyBars recognizes the indicator by its exact name.  
Ill try it and then change the surce code from StepChoppyBars in order to use StepMA_v7.2.mq4  
  
Thank you Lugopt!

Good it was solved. Yes, I forgot to tell you StepChoppyBars needs the exact name of the other two indicators in order to recognize them.

I understand your point. However, if you divide you lot size by 3, its not necessary to multiply negative pips by 3. If you sum up total pips lost for the three positions, you should at the same time consider that those positions are 1/3 of your original lot size each. So, you are loosing almost the same if you open 1 lot than if you open three positions of 0.3 lot each.  
Those ugly -522 pips for the three positions are in fact -174 pips for your regular lot size.  
  
The reason I decide to open three positions becomes obvious when you test and see the system working. A high percentage of the positions you enter reaches 1st TP. At that point you are free of any possible loss. But also at that point sometimes the trend continues and sometimes not. You cannot be sure about what will happen, so you have two remaining positions with SL at breakeven that have a great potential to close with high earnings (or at cero in the worst case).  
  
Thank you for your contribution!

Hi Blackeagle, the only difference I have noticed is between demo and live accounts. Usually, price quotation in demo is not the same that in live, so you may notice some colour diferences. I didnt test this among different brokers.  
If you want to backtest, try using Alpari historical data.

Hi Vitaliy, thank you very much for your post. I will be soon publishing a full backtest with statistics (like MT4 reports).

That's why I said your risk reward ratio will not change. You can have -522 pips loss, but your profits will be high too. If you open three positions of 0.3 lot each, you will have -174 pips loss but your profit in total will be reduced proportionally compared to trading standard lots.  
  
And I agree with you to trade this system with multiple lots, because it provides better risk management.

> I understand your point. However, if you divide you lot size by 3, its not necessary to multiply negative pips by 3. If you sum up total pips lost for the three positions, you should at the same time consider that those positions are 1/3 of your original lot size each. So, you are loosing almost the same if you open 1 lot than if you open three positions of 0.3 lot each.

At that point you are free of any possible loss. But also at that point sometimes the trend continues and sometimes not. You cannot be sure about what will happen, so you have two remaining positions with SL at breakeven that have a great potential to close with high earnings (or at cero in the worst case).

I am attaching my GBPJPY chart on Alpari server and please compare it with the one on your post #56. As you will see, there are differences. I am not sure if the one on post#56 is from Alpari. It looks it is from Metaquotes Corp. which may have different data feed and therefore different bars.  
  
After I have read your first post, I have found the original thread on tsd forum and there are a couple people there complaining about different charts on different mt4 platforms. I am using Alpari and will stick to it to follow your system.  
  
A few people on tsd forum also complained about repainting of the bars, I have been watching the indicator since yesterday and I haven't seen such a repainting yet.

Rename both indicators as stepRSI_v5.2 and StepChoppyBars_v1.1 and StepMA_v7 if it has a bracket as well.

Doesn't look bad for me...  
  
These are the trades (using Alpari data):  
  
Trade #1  
  
Sell @ 221.17 - 04.09.2006 8:00 (Red candle closing between yellow and orange line, but very close to yellow line so I take it as a trade according to the logics. We open 2 positions, ignoring the 1st one)  
TP2 @ 219.75 - 05.09.2006 12:00  
SL3 @ 219.00 - 11.09.2006 8:00  
  
Results (counting 9 pips spread):  
2nd Position: +133 pips  
3rd Position: +208 pips  
Total: +341 pips  
  
Trade #2  
  
Buy @ 219.72 - 12.09.2006 0:00  
TP1 @ 220.63 - 12.09.2006 12:00  
TP2 @ 221.81 - 14.09.2006 12:00  
SL3 @ 220.77 - 15.09.2006 12:00  
  
Results (counting 9 pips spread):  
1st Position: +82 pips  
2nd Position: +200 pips  
3rd Position: +96 pips  
Total: +378 pips  
  
Trade #3  
  
Buy @ 221.80 - 26.09.2006 20:00  
SL1, SL2, SL3 @ 220.28 - 29.09.2006 12:00  
  
Results (counting 9 pips spread):  
1st Position: -161 pips  
2nd Position: -161 pips  
3rd Position: -161 pips   
Total: -483 pips  
  
Results for September 2006 month: +236  
  
So the "worst" month resulted in a 236 pips gain...  
  
Looking very good for me. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Yes, I see some colour differences between Alpari chart and Metaquotes chart, but it's not indicators fault. These variations are because of the differences between Alpari data and Metaquotes data. Just compare candles opens, closes, highs and lows and you'll notice considerable disparities.   
  
Just as an example. See (in 4H chart) candle **28.03.2007 4:00  
  
** For Alpari data:  
Open: 230.64  
High: 230.89  
Low: 229.89  
Close: 230.29  
  
For Metaquotes data:  
Open: 231.65  
High: 231.69  
Low: 230.03  
Close: 230.17  
  
StepChoppyBars seems to be very sensitive to price quotation, so I think this should be the reason.  
  
Regarding bars repainting, that seems to happen sometimes on shorter timeframes like M1 and M5. For longer timeframes like H1, H4, D1 I haven't seen bars repainting during all this time.

Take a look at the two charts Im attaching. There you can see all candles for September 2006 month with explanations. Those are all the trades I see. Remember that if you have a trade in process you dont open a new one till the three positions were closed.

For the first chart, you have a sell signal **@ 207.28 - 16.05.2006 12:00  
**The three positions are closed **@ 207.21 17.05.2006 - 12:00** when the LightBlue candle appears. I see that in your chart that candle doesnt appear LightBlue (it appears Orange), so for you they should be closed at the next Blue candle.

Chart 4 is cleared in my previous post about September month.  
  
As you can see, that is what I ment in my 1st post when I said this system usually tells you early to exit a position that is not favorable.  
And if its in our favor, it usually generates MANY pips.

our charts slightly different that why ... and its weird, is there any settings in the indicators ?  
what settings do you have for shoppybar indicator ??? because changing HighLow to true seemed to change my chart slightly, and corrected this small problem in may mmm , but then it created problems in another part of the chart ...  
  
so what about chart 4 ? for october, what do you think of that, or on your chart indicators are different ?

Hi Pabloski,   
I wanted to clarify something.   
When opening new trade, it opens at the open of the new bar and 2 previous bars are blue or first is blue and second is yellow.   
  
Is that correct.?  
  
First I got the impression that as soon as last bar was blue you can open.  
I am making backtest EA for this and wanted to clarify.

Hi Irusoh,  
  
The rule to buy is that the bar for the candle that has just closed is painted blue, and the previous bar is blue or yellow. To sell, the bar for the candle that has just closed is painted red, and the previous bar is red or aqua. You must always wait for the candle to close. The last candle that is still opened is not considered.  
  
Hope it helps! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Could you have taken the previous candle since it looks like it closed above the aqua line? Are you still in with 3 positions? Where is your 1st TP.

If you read the logics, candle must close between lime and aqua lines. You may also buy if a candle closes between aqua and dodgerblue lines but VERY close to aqua line (when I say VERY close, I mean candle closing no more than 10 pips away from aqua line).  
  
So, answering your question, you can consider the previous candle as a signal to buy as its closing very close to aqua line. I didnt see this ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1):, thank you!  
  
Im in with 3 positions. To know what is my 1st TP read the logics.  
  
Best wishes!

So, based in the logic of this system, your SL is at 229.23 ?

Candle closing above aqua line, closing 1st position with +12 pips. Moved SL to breakeven.

Hi pabloski,  
  
You said SL for the three opened LONG positions is a candle closing below Yellow ATR line. And you also said we should open three SHORT positions when a candle closes between ATR Lime centre line and ATR Yellow line.  
  
Regarding recent LONG position form 234.85, let's say we have a close between centre lime line and yellow line with a red candle and previous candle is red or aqua. In this case, SL for the long position will be between centre lime line and yellow line since we are going to close our long position and open short.  
  
Therefore, in practice, can we say SL is not ALWAYS below yellow line (for longs) or above aqua line (for shorts) depending on the colours of StepChoppy candles?

I did not go long because my alpari chart shows the last three candles as dodger blue.

This is right. However, I dont consider this as a SL for the long position. If you read the logics: **"In the case a candle is painted Red, Tomato, Orange or Yellow during any time of the process, all positions should be closed."** So long positions are closed because of what previous rule says, not because SL was reached.

2nd and 3rd positions closed with no profits (breakeven). This was a very short trade, but in profit.

Its clear that different price quotes from different brokers causes colour variations in StepChoppyBars indicator. Im suing NF for my live trades. I will try to compare the signals with other brokers data in the upcoming days.

How can we change the parametres of the indicators to make this strategy to work with the other pairs?

I'm trading with IBFX and FXDD. Their MT4s produce different colors. In this case, FXDD's MT4 has similar colors to pabloski's chart colors.

No, you must always wait for the candle to close.

How do you propose to act in the situations like this one?  
(The red candle after the aqua one but closed below the yellow line)  
Thank you!

Thanks Pabloski for sharing your strategy.   
  
We have finished testing GBPJPY with your rules on post #1. From Jan 06 to April 07, total profit is 9,285 pips. # of total trades is 57 with 45 wins and 12 losses giving 78.9% win ratio (If you look at monthly figures, the one we prefer to evaluate systems, there are 4 months with losses out of 15 which gives us 73.3% winning ratio). Max loss with 3 lots is -720 pips (-240 pips per lot) and losses are generally not less than 100 pips per lot. The results is promising for a trend following strategy, but there are a few issues we'd like to discuss.   
  
First of all, 7631 pips of total profits (82.2%) are coming from 4 months (Feb & Apr 06, Feb & Mar 07) and 4931 pips (53.1%) are coming from last 2 months which had exceptionally strong moves, both up and down, on GBPJPY. Secondly, a consistent uptrend/downtrend is not enough to get a good result from any trade, the move should be very strong, because there are many trades ended at BE (second and third lots) (though it is good in a sense of riding a risk-free trade) although they caught the move in early stages. Therefore, our recommendations would be to modify SL strategy and maybe the rule for exiting the 3rd lot to increase the profit potential. Because, sometimes, due to a strong move, price hit the last ATR line and then consolidates. During this consolidation period, ATR lines keep moving in trade direction but the bar is closed in SL area (above orange line or below dodger blue line) due to this horizontal move. So, we noticed during the backtests that some trades exited the third lot very early. Another recommendation would be to trade 4 lots instead of 3 and trailing the 4th lot similar to the 3rd lot (after modifying the 3rd lot exit). Drawdown can be seen a bit too much (-720 pips) by many others, but we believe it is not for this pair and a trend following strategy, though can be reduced by modifying SL rules (we are going to work on this as TeamAphid).  
  
Anyway, our recommendation in overall is to modify some of the SL and exit rules (these should be backtested properly before amending the original rules)in order to have much more consistent results and not depend on a few months of very strong moves. We believe this method is profitable in the long run if applied with discipline, especially on GBPJPY as it is the most trending pair.  
  
ps. We did not put exit dates and times on backtest spreadsheet to speed up testing process. You can find them by using prices. We used Alpari server and historical data in our tests.   
  
Regards,  
TeamAphid

I've created a backtest EA that tests pabloski strategy.  
I want to post resulting chart shots month by month for discussion.  
  
Here is a month of January.   
First comment: it seems that when trade goes wrong from the beginning there are large losses.  
Also Mr Pabloski and others can comment if they see any inconsistencies with the original system.

Seems like this method was not good in that month for short trades.

Great month. Three trades, all winners, worked as designed.  
Someone asked, can you make 1400 pips off one symbol per month.  
Here is the answer. Question is which month?

Disaster. Giving back all February gains.  
When this system loses, it loses big.  
If anyone wants to know if you can lose 1400 pips per month, here it is.

I think the problem is the SL too far from the entry, there must be a better method to get out early from a bad trade.

There seems to be a difference in your EA results to those that were posted by Team Aphid.  
  
The TA results showed Jan-288, Feb +1496 and March -930 ...Maybe a mixup of rules?

These are my counts for the Jan, Feb and March 2006. Using logics exactly as stated including the option:  
Buy if a candle closes between aqua and dodgerblue lines but VERY close to aqua line (no more than 10 pips away from aqua line). Sell if a candle closes between yellow and orange lines but VERY close to yellow line (no more than 10 pips away from yellow line).  
Results include spread. In the charts you can see "StepChoppy" indicator which exactly the same as "stepChoppyBars" but shows bars colours in a separate window.

I have designed a new method to pace SLs which reduces considerably losing pips. Ill post a detailed description and add it to the logics tomorrow.

I will consider your helpful advices to improve this system. Ill post some modifications very soon.

Irusoh's charts show that he is using Metaquote Company's server, not the Alpari. That should be the main reason of difference.

Pabloski, we thank you for sharing this method and we believe it can be improved to the extent that trading only GBPJPY (if this is the best pair for this method and even if it doesn't work that well on the others) can be really profitable due to the nature of GBPJPY.  
  
We are also working on improvements.  
  
We are going to check your charts and results and compare them and Irusoh's with ours.

Hello Pabloski, hello TeamAphid, hello Irusoh!  
  
I don't understand your March back test. Correct me if I'm wrong.  
  
Let's take minimum. Let's work with only 1 position. It's equal to breakeven for other 2 positions if there is TP for the first one. Ok?  
  
Now here is my March chart by Alpari. I see no one SL. All positions are closed with TP @ minimum condition: "candle close above/below aqua/yellow line".  
  
Please tell me am I right? Or did I missed something? It's really neccessary for me because I'm really interested deeply in this strategy.  
  
And thanks again for sharing!

Aktaurus, your chart is showing March 2007. Pabloski's and our backtests are for March 2006. You are correct that there is no SL in March 2007.

To answer Team Aphid question I use alpari data that I took from alpari UK databank. I converted M1 data into all other timeframes for which I use my own script to synchronize alpari data in all timeframes. I ran it on Velocity Trader server, which essentially makes no difference except for spread may vary by dealer.  
  
One serious mistake that may happen with backtesting is unsynhronized data across different timeframes. That is M1 data does not correspond to H4 data, for example loading M1 data from alpari but leaving H4 data that was in history before. The important thing is not which server is running the data but the data be completely synchornized from M1.  
So I loaded synchronized M1 thru D1 data for 2006 into history.  
The second important thing when backtesting is to use MT visual tester even for manual backtesting. Quite often indicators give signals differently in real time rather than just looking back at historical chart. Thus certain entries that didn't take place in historical chart may happen in real time since signal was given and then erased later on recalculation.  
I used EA that picked up signals as they were presented at the time of evaluation.  
  
Of course choppybars may look different on different charts too due to various timeshifts with different dealers but then again good system can't depend on how signal is generated based on time shift and should on average make money regardless.  
  
The only difference in my expert was that it chose to exit instantly when bar changed from blue colors to red colors on a buy and vice versa. It seemed sometimes it gave a better exit point than just waiting for s/l to be hit. But it doesn't seem to happen very often.  
  
I am waiting anxiously for improvement suggetstions from Pabloski and/or Team Aphid to incorporate into the system.

3 trades all positive.  
Unfortunately long trade ended to early due to s/l.

Well in that case after close the long 3er position (+39 in the graph), you have an aqua bar (or lightblue) and then another blue bar between green and aqua line, based on the system your expert must open a new long position the next blue bar following the blue bar opened.

It's hard to see here, but I think what happened, that bar closed slightly above aqua line so expert took no trade.  
If one wants to still take trade few ticks above aqua, this is possible but then has to be restested for all data, to see if it gives more porfit than loss.  
Maybe can take 2 positions instead of 3 and set s/l below green line.

Here I found on the first trade that waiting for bar to close to tunr red paid off. So better result.

That trade (04/12 08:00 bar LONG) is the main difference between our April results. Since it is within 10 pips range of green line, as explained in the strategy, we chose to take 3 positions here which gave us +497 pips. These kind of situations will vary the results as taking the trade is discretionary depending on your risk appetite.  
  
We compared your charts (as much as we can see) with our and they are almost identical. We are, as a team, doing all our backtests ONLY manually.

Could you please write the rule of entry? Yellow-blue - is it candle or line? Can you show any chart?  
  
Thank you!

You mean enter long after yellow and blue candles?  
What is your exit point?   
Or you just use the same setup as original only with 20pip s/l?

Hi,  
I did a research, and the result varies, the most confident entry level was after a candles yellow and blue, you shoul enter after the signal was given,(yellow folowed by a blue candle). I just did the research in the GBP/USD 15M and 30M. I found better results in 15M charts. I looked into 4H charts, but the result varies and not so good, and we have to set a higher S/L. I dont like my short stack of money floating with those monster out there.Every pair has is own conditions, I will posted the results as long I finished with the others. So, you should find your comfort zone and investing strategies. I like short entries, and avoid get hit by markets news and market corrections. I enter strong trying to profit in the short run. Eleven signals in march and 9 went perfect, 40, 27, 32, 52, 21,20,39, 105, 142, I will close 80% with 20 pips and the other 20 i let it run moving my S/L to make 10 pips in the other 20%. Next target will be 40 where I will close the other 15%, let it run the other 5% and moving the S/L to 20 pips gain, Which is my confort winning zone. I usually enter with 20 standart lots or 200 usd every pips it moves. I'm happy making $20,000 a month. The other two trades that went wrong were -26 and -25, but i always put 20 pips S/L. we could chance to avoid those losses, for the trade lasted longer than usual, almost 6 and 8 hrs to lose our money. I will recommend if after 2 hours it hasn't move as expected, we should close our position. If doing it, we should profit from those losses18 and 17 pips respectively, Which it makes it 11 out 11 trades. 100% perfect trades. Anyway, let it run after closing at 20 pips profit, we could easily upset the losses. Becarful with MT4 signals, it gives me completely different signals between accounts, I had 2 accounts and a demo, and my partner has another 2 accounts, one of my account give me different signals, for it workd with another server, so beware you do not received wrong signals. Finally, tested with small lots until you gain confidence and get familiar withy the indicator.   
  
Up- trends signal:  
Yellow- blue: strong signal...  
blue-blue:weak signal...i get 60% result  
  
down trends:  
acqua-red: strong signal. 55% result  
red-red:weak signal. 41% results  
  
check before trade, and good luck!!!!  
I hope that can be useful information!!!!!  
  
  
check fridays signals:  
down trend was an excellent signal.entry at 1.9825 it went down to 1,9781..  
investing 10 standard lots or 100usd per 1 pips it moves...  
first close at 20 pips or 1.9801...profit $1600 move S/L to 1.9835  
second close at 40 pips 1.9781..15% profit $600 move S/L to 1.9825  
Let it run the other 5%, which retraces to 1.9801..profit $100  
total profit: $2300  
  
and then after the up-trend yellow-blue:  
enter 1.9849 close 80% at 1.9869 profit $1600 move S/L to 1.9859  
second close at 1.9889, but it retraced to 1.9856, so we close the other 20% profit $200  
total profit:$1800...  
  
not bad for a 4hr trade... total profit $4100....  
Always use your take a profit manager so you avoid fast market movements and no need to set your S/L and take a profit manually or do any calcalutions, and always hide your S/L and take a profit targets from your broker, so they could not see where your S/L is...and activate your expert advisors once you close the 80% you dont need to stay in front of the computer all day....  
Once again Good Luck!!!!

I always recommend follow the trend, I will always invest going with the trend, I dont try to guess the market. Forex market are very trendy, from my short experience. Do not enter a trade without no reason. we will have to wait when the trend reverse to downtrend, maybe the strong down trend signal aqua-red, has a better % of return..eventhough is not bad...  
To determine the trend, I will always look at 4H and daily charts...  
Good Luck!!!  
P.D. Remember to be aware of different server signals by your broker, and every pair has its own characteristics. this research applies only to GBP/USD...Also, do not enter the market when economics releases are given...must of te time the news reaffirm the trend..is just like people know what to expect ..info filter everywhere...look at the charts, and u will find out that we always enter the market after a trend is on the way...dont be afraid eventhough it has move already 100 pips...also just put a S/L or enter with less lots at news....I am working on GBP/JPY

Without ATR-lines analise? Candles colours only?

ATR Lines will only confirm the volatility ahead..as the ATR widened the volatility is low....when they are narrowing something big is coming...check today before the big jump....only a difference of 50 pips between the two extremes..after the economic releases more than 200 pips...if you go backwards it happens in most of the cases..todays weak uptrend signal(blue-blue)...which is 60% effective...using it properly almost 67%....gaves the entry point GBP/USD at 1.9922, before the news release it was already at 1.9940...i will played safe at economic releases with a S/L...but even after the economic release it gaves us again the weak up trend signal at 2.0024 and it went up to 2.0073, but i will only go for 20 pips closing 80% of my position...and then so on....another 15% at 40 pips and let it run...but with weak signal i will say closed your entire position with 20 pips profit...olnly 13% of the weak signal trend reach 40 pips gain...i will not take that risk...the purpose is open and lock in your profits..more signal will come for sure...that's trading wait for the right time and right moment..always trying to enter the market when we have the advantage...even the bulls with michael jordan lost 12 games in that memorable season...and brazil lost the world cup...no one really knows what's going to happen..otherwise we should not be here trying to figure it out how to beat the market...so keep the calm and do not fustrate when we have 4 or 5 bad trades in a row...try to equalize all trades..and do not put more weight in some trades than other...avoid surprises...all trades equals....thanks pablosky...working in GBP/JPY...and I will put close attetion to the ATR movements..to close our positions...Thanks for the feedback..

You could check my PIPS results for March for the strong up trend signal(yellow-blue) to compare the results and determine the proper platform and server. Finally, you shouls tested before with small lots or a demo until you gain confidence and get familiar withy the indicator.

Thanks Bluemiami for your inputs. As I told you, Ill test your variation and let you know my results.  
  
Im sorry for my late post, I have been studying and looking many ways to improve this system during these days.  
Finally, after testing A LOT of indicators, I have came across one called "TrendPower" which seems to do an amazing job filtering trades. To test it, I used TeamAphid backtest.  
  
Rules for filtering trades with TrendPower indicator are:  
Buy if TrendPower value is >= 0.14  
Sell if TrendPower value us <= -0.14  
  
Settings for the indicator are:  
ADXPeriod=14  
SMAFast=5  
SMASlow=14  
  
So, what results did I get? From ThemAphid backtest, ALL negative trades except 1 were filtered. That is only 1 losing trade for 15 months. On the other side, it filtered also some positive trades but most of them were trades that resulted in small profit (this is explaned as they were from weaker trends). Many trades were modified as the entry point was triggered some candles after.  
  
Results:  
Total trades=33  
Winning trades=32 (97%)  
Losing trades=1 (3%)  
  
Total pips: +11221  
  
No losing months, all in profit.  
  
Like it? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
  
I think this can be perfectly adjusted for other trending pairs and other timeframes with excellent results. We just need to adjust the settings and entry levels for TrendPower indicator and also we may change general rules of the system itself.  
  
Check the .xls file and indicator attached.  
  
Best wishes!

The candle had closed yellow.  
The next candle started forming and the previous (already closed) candle turned blue.

I was looking at 15M bars.  
  
I suspect that if the bars repaint on one time frame, they will repaint on any time frame.  
I may be wrong.

Indeed. StepChoppyBars tends to repaint on shorter timeframes like M1, M5 and M15. For longer timeframes like H1, H4, D1 bars generally dont repaint.

I can't see the indicator. Maybe was not attached due to viruses.  
Paploski, can you repost the trendpower indicator.

I've been doing some testing of my own with this system using an Expert Advisor.  
  
I've come to the following results.  
  
1\. It seems best setting for ATR channels indicator is 1.4,2.9,4.0  
2\. When setting s/l after first close, it is better to wait for the bar to close first. If bar closes higher (on buy) set s/l at breakeven, otherwise close trade at once  
3\. Wait for the last unit to close (below/above) green line (on buy/sell) at all times eliminating all complex rules with touching blue line etc.  
4\. My test showed (from 8/2004 to 12/2006) that there were only 4 trades that closed 2nd unit and then went to b/e. So I eliminated 2nd unit close and hold 2 last units as per rule 3.  
  
in my tests after applying these rules results approximately doubled.  
  
This was a test for GBPJPY.

After testing GBPJPY, we have decided to test EURJPY and GBPUSD to see if pabloski system is profitable for these pairs as well.  
  
When we finished the first four months of testing EURJPY, we wanted to check the results and see if the stepchoppy indicator was repainting. We saw that most of the entry bar colours went one bar backward (ie. entry at 12:00 bar became an entry at 08:00 bar). Some of the entry bars went backward multiple bars (4/5 bars backward) and some of the entries were missed during the backtests and some of the entries shouldn't have been taken. After years of manual backtesting experience of Team Aphid, we have decided that this cannot be a mistake by us, and the conclusion was the indicator is repainting. We wanted to test GBPUSD as well to make sure of this situation and the indicator has repainted itself on this pair as well.  
  
Now, the strange thing is that we have been keeping records of every bar colour of GBPJPY since April 9th and we check our backtest results posted on this thread twice everyday to see if the indicator repaints, and the colours are still 100% matching. So, the indicator repaints itself on EURJPY and GBPUSD, but does not repaint on GBPJPY. That's pretty weird, we think.  
  
Another observation is that we used same broker, same server, same platform and same open/high/low/close prices, everything was the same bar by bar on two different computers, but the colours of the bars were different.  
  
Our conclusion on this issue is that Stepchoppy indicator is not stable, but somehow it still did not repaint on GBPJPY and it is still stable on this pair only. We keep watching it on GBPJPY and if it repaints, we'll inform you asap.  
  
ps. we only use 4hr time frame, not shorter ones.

I think it has to be happenstance that the GBP/JPY was not observed repainting.   
  
The programing allows a bar to change color after close and I don't see how a particular pair could be exempt from that.  
  
I've followed a lot of false leads on systems that looked great on a chart and they turned out to be repainting. This is nothing new.

Hi pabloski, our opinion is that it shouldn't repaint at all, otherwise backtest results will not be reliable.  
  
There were complaints on other forum that this Stepchoppy indicator was first released but the thread owner/originator did not reply to those claims.  
  
Anyway, we recommend everyone to watch this indicator on GBPJPY and see if it repaints previous bars before taking live trades.  
  
When we are sure it is not repainting, we'll continue to improve and backtest this system with new rules and we'll share the results with you.

We agree with you how a particular pair could be exempt form that but it is the case for the time being. We are checking our backtest results since Jan. 2006 twice everyday on current GBPJPY chart and all entry and exit bar colours are still matching the test results. This means it didn't repaint YET, and we believe it will likely repaint, but we must be sure to claim that and we must see what we saw on other pairs.

Hello pabloski and thank you for the update!  
  
There was an error in the indicator: unexpected ";". I've deleted it, it seems to be working but... Could you please just write your MQ4-text of the indicator right here in the message? It would be more real.  
  
Thank you!

Hi Guys,  
I have been looking all day at 15M charts, to see if the bars repaints, but so far, it has not repainted. I am just looking for the big markets swings to enter into a position, especially after news trades, so far pablosky's system keeps giving me those profitable signals.  
Today, 4/20 at 4.30am eastern time USA, I did a trade on GBP/JPY retail sales. Before the news, the price opened at 237.93, the bar before was acqua, then went down to 237.46 closing at 237.48 the bar closed red. Strong dowtrend signal was given, so I enter the next one at 237.49 after almost 50 pips down in 30M and 82 pips since the european markets open at 2:00 AM or 2:30 hours. So, it finally went down to 237.18, but I closed my 20 pips profit at 237.21 using my take a profit manager, beacuse it rebounds back so fast that I could not even have a chance to close it manually, and most important the bar did not repaint, at least in my demo account which is the one that gives me the right signal.   
OHHHH...I just look into my demo platform GBP/USD also, and everything worked fine too. it gave the downtrend signal perfectly (aqua-red). I could not trade because I was trading the GBP/USD, but also we could profit 20 pips following the acqua-red strong downtrend signal...  
On the other hand, my live account gaves me different signals, only acqua-acqua-acqua, and completely different colors afterward, but it never gave me the acqua-red and desired entry signal. Right now, I have a weak uptrend signal (blue-blue-blue) in my live account, but my demo platform is giving me(yellow-yellow-orange), so no trade. So, I stick with my demo platform which is working perfectly, and the one fortunely I did the research on. Otherwise, I could not be trading on pabloski's system today. Reasons why I told you to confirm trading signals before entering any trade, and do your personal reasearch.   
I have been watching the only pairs I trade after the sad news of repaint, GBP/USD, GBP/JPY, ERU/JPY, USD/JPY, EUR/USD and at least all day today, it has not repaint after a bar closed(15M CHARTS ONLY). I repeat, I havent seen any repaint. If anyone has seen something different in 15M charts feel free to comment please. I noticed that bars repaint before closing the 15M cycle, but after the bar closed the previous one has not repainted yet, At least in todays personal experiment.   
I just try to follow the market trend, and when everyone is selling at unison , no one is buying, except some no brain like me at times before, then prices drop like crazy, especially in such speculative pair like GBP,JPY that's a market behavior, and I just followed and profit from that behavior. Who control the market, banks!!! Bank's traders have rules to follow, they called trading policy, we, the small fish,do not have any policy, we enter anytime without a boss behind and a set of undefine and undisciplined rules( I included myself, working on improvement). We just loss( in most cases) or win our money, not a job or reputation. So, when they enter the market all bank's traders(who has the biggest volume and price movements influences) follow the same rules, if the economic releases was below expectations, which bank will go against the market? No one, I guess, that's when everyone enter the market and prices move like crazy in one direction. I recommend follow the trend, NEVER CHALLENGE the market, I learned from personal experience. So far, the system is working for me. If anyone noticed something different please let us know.   
We should be like bank traders, we should have our own trade rules that we must never violate!!!! avoid emotions, over trading, and forget about guts, that does not lead to success at least in trading. All my losses has come from guessing, overtrading, sticking to undisareable trades that last longer that expected, not recognizing a loss, that later becomes catasthrophic (both financially and emotional), not setting predefine rules with entry and exit points, stop-losses( not all trades will go as expected) and finally trying to reinvent the wheel(personally working and improving trading strategies, this forum is helping me). This market is rules set, we dont make the rules, big players make the rules at least in the short term, which is my trading strategy and for 99% of small stack traders. Who enter in a position for a year, a month, even a week, let say for an entire day, at least all my trades I generally close them in less than 30 minutes, some last days, small positions only, and with this system sometime after profit my 20 pips less than a minute. The market will finally correct after a combination of economic data and fundamentals, Banks or institutional investors has been here for centuries, and more to come profiting from unexperienced traders who enter the market dreaming to turn into the next Soros or Ihcan, and this guys are more sophisticated than any company out there. They have between others, but two major advantages: Technology(research-software) and Rules that make big players and any trading strategy succesful over the long run. I would include capital too $$$$, but biggest players have break down like LTCM, hegde funds like Amarath recently, and also banks who play against the market. Thanks to pablosky and others, we have some helpful tools, but what small investors also need are a set of unbreakable rules, like a trading bible that work according to a trader personality. I recommend to share your trading with a group of two, maximum three traders, It's definitely cost wise,funny, it has physical,mental,social, and healthy benefits, risk sharing, time saving, and force you to make the necessary rules to succeed in this difficult profession. Sometimes, the best system is not the most sophisticated and perfect, like the ones that Credit Suisse or Goldamn Sachs has, is the one that works for you personally and fit accordingly to your personality, eventhough has it flows and mistakes, everything needs readjustment, upgrades and constant changes until reach the desired perfection, also, the one that boost your confidence and finally make you successful. Good day and good Luck to all!!!! Thanks again for sharing your knowledge and research, I am trying and giving my best.

The 16M bars do repaint. I have watched them do it in real time.  
  
That does not mean this isn't a good system and that the system won't make money.  
  
It means that one cannot look back on historical charts and draw any accurate conclusions about price movement and bar color. Any testing done on this system must be real time forward testing.

His guys,  
My friend noticed that the EUR/JPY 15M chart repainted. Today starting at 8.30am after 4 straight yellow, the fifth bar closed yellow, but when the other start moving it repainted to blue, which is an strong signal to enter the market. We had enough time to close the position without a loss after 2H, does not move as expected we should close the position, BUt definitely that's a misleading signal. UNACCEPATBLE!!!, let see if pabloski can do anything about it. So, far I haven't see any repaint, but we must be very careful, and monitored well this system. I will keep trading following the same rules mainly in GBP/JPY GBP/USD pairs. I will post any irregularities. If anyone noticed anything, please feel free to comment and keep everyone inform. Have a wonderful weekend!!!!!!  
Let see next week!!!!!

Like Bill said, that doesn't mean that this is not a good system, so far is working. Now, I have to question the accuracy of the research and how effective is pabloski's system. I am testing it in real trading, and so far 2/2 in GBP/USD and GBP/JPY strong signals. I'll let you know is something goes wrong. If anyone using it in real trading, where emotions are different like just look at the chart and said we could have make easy money. Nothing is easy money in this world, but if the sytem is accurate enough to give results above 65% at least with strong signals, i'll stick to it. Please post your results and observation. Thanks!!!!

I don't know why so much fuss about repainting.  
Repainting is normal for many indicators. As price moves, conditions change and indicator repaints itself.  
Now, a real time testing is crucial because the way indicator looks on historical chart, is not necessarily how it happened in real life.  
For example if bar repaints itself from yellow to blue, it is good idea to exit short position, just what bluemiami did, I beleive. Sometimes 2 bars change from yellow to blue at once, thus real time entry is delayed since 2 bars that look blue on historical chart weren't blue when bar closed.  
The real time testing should be first accomplished with MT tester and then on demo account.

Repainting is a fuss because looking back on the charts doesn't give you a clue how the system performs.  
  
Forward testing is important on any system.   
  
There are many systems to choose from for your testing.  
  
Would you rather spend your time forward testing one that historically has been profitable or one that is a complete unknown?  
  
I'm not sure about this, but I doubt you can do an accurate MT4 backtest on repainting bars.  
  
These bars have problems beyond repainting.  
Team Aphid observed two different computers with the same platform and same data feed looking at the same pairs on the same TF, coloring the bars differently.  
  
I have seen other exotic indicators do exactly the same kind of thing.

I just did a backtest on 2 different platforms which by the way show different color bars for the last few bars. (one shows yellow, the other blue).  
  
Even though results are different they are similar, one shows 2378 pip gain the other 2768. But with spread difference between the two, the pip diff should be no more than 200 pips. That's good a test enough for me to show that systam works no matter how it paints itself over time.  
I think that to test systems that use such indicators by looking at historical charts is a good way to lose your pants.

The backtests which will be done with repainting indicators are not reliable, as you all know. Therefore, only way is forward testing to understand if the system is profitable or not. The fuss for repainting indicators is about the time, because forward testing takes time.   
  
We asked our programmer about stepchoppy indicator and he said it can repaint after checking the codes for all four indicators. He says it repaints due to the StepRSI indicator which is used to calculate stepchoppy indicator. He said StepRSI calculates its values from the left of the chart, and not the right. Therefore at every new bar it recalculates everything, creating opportunity for repainting. He stated that the formulas "buffer" it very good, so it's not happening a lot but it can happen. This is the main reason you see it repaints more frequently on 15M chart than 4hr.  
  
We believe there are two ways to trade this system. One is after forward testing and observing the bars real time so that we can have more reliable test results. The other one is not to use stepchoppy indicator if you find it unreliable and use only ATR channels, Trend Power indicator and price action, all together. At the moment, we are forward testing pabloski system with our modified rules (we already backtested it with our modified rules, and the result has improved a lot but due to the repainting nature of stepchoppy indicator, we are not sure how this result is reliable), and we are also backtesting another modified pabloski system without using stephoppy indicator.  
  
We are going to share both systems here under pabloski thread to honour his generosity for sharing the indicators, his strategies and ideas.

These are two quite dissimilar opinions. Lets first study and analyse the system carefully before making any conclusive judgment/s. Just my opinion. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

I completely agree with you Irusoh.  
  
Test, modify, improve, analyse, adapt, etc, etc. If it is working for you, then is ok!

We are trying to modify your system as well, but what we are doing different is to keep the time frame same, some of the basic rules same and indicators same. After backtesting your original rules, we saw some opportunities to improve the statistics and result of your system and decided to test those opportunities.

I like stepchoppy indicator, even though it repaints. I only saw it repaint one previous bar so far on 4hour chart. I couldn't find usefulness of trendpower indicator. Just from visual obsertvation it seemed to show all kinds of values on various system entries.  
But then again, as Team Aphid noted, I bastardized this system a lot in the course of my testing, so I don't know if I should post my results here in conflict with original.  
  
Among other things, I got rid of stoploss, i got rid of 2nd close, and I hold last unit until it goes opposite color or breaks the green line, just to name a few.   
It is still not perfect, there are a lot of things to be worked on, but I consider it a workable system to be put into forward test.

Hi,  
What is the difference between stepchoppy v1.1 and v1.3?  
I am using v1.1.   
So far, I am looking at 15M chart GBP/JPY and no repaint yet....

Hi Bluemiami!  
  
In terms of given signals, they are exactly the same. The first version of this indicator was StepChoppy. Then the author had the idea of showing the signals as candles or bars, so he created StepChoppyBars from StepChoppy v1.3.  
Both indicators will give the same signals (as they are actually the same indicator ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f633.png?v=15.1)) but in different ways, thats all! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Hi,  
Thanks pabloski. So far, I've checking all day since the opening at 6pm 15M Charts, GBP/JPY, GBP/USD and EUR/JPY, and no repainting so far. The system could have its minors flaws, but the most important thing is from now on, as the masterteam said, forward testing and real results. I am working on this three pairs for the moment. Good Luck to all!!!

Hi, Pabloski, I appreciate your efforts in presenting this wonderful system to us. Just a quick quesiton to clarify, for the following quotation about buy logics, you said that the Step Choppy Bars candle should be blue and previous step Choppy Bar Candle is Blue or Yellow.  
  
Does the "blue" of the previous bar only refer to the blue color or any color in the blue range? In other words, what if the current candle is blue and the previous candle is either dodgeblue,lightblue or aqua, shall we enter the long position?  
  
Thank you.

I think you must wait for a bar with the legend "Strong UpTrend" in the tooltip, a navy blue bar.

Yes, I understand that the current bar should be navy blue,   
  
but what if the previous bar is dodgeblue.  
  
If we can enter when the PREVIOUS bar is yellow, we should also be able to enter if the previous bar is dodgeblue because dodgeblue is more uptrending than yellow.

I believe light blues do not appear after a yellow bar, that is why the bar before the entry bar for a long should be navy blue or yellow.  
  
On my chart the short of 19th April changed to long on today's 1st bar.

Are you trading this system?  
  
Did you not get a dark blue bar after a yellow bar closing in the zone between the green and aqua lines to go long during the period since the 19th April?

We have decided to forward test this system after backtesting and getting fantastic results with our modified rules.  
  
We are using Alpari, Russian server (there is also UK one), and there is no blue bar after the short entry on April 19th.

Ok, thanks, so the difference is due to different server times and therefore different 4h closing, my daily bar opens at 10pm UK time (GMT+1). Right now another blue bar after aqua is forming on my chart which closes in about 1 hour 30 min.  
  
Have you disclosed your modifications?

I have created an expert with quite different rules but nonetheless based on Pabloski's idea. I am now forward testing in and at the same time working on improvements.  
Entry/exit structure was greatly simplified. Also martingale like money management (I will call it smart martingale) was added to improve results.  
  
First buy was taken on NF on 2007.04.23 04:00 for 0.8 lots. It is now -84 pips.  
Additional buy was taken on 2007.04.24 04:46 for 0.8 lots. it is now +84.  
  
When I am satisfied with my system I will probably try to describe it in a separate thread.

I understand that there has already been a trend filter that makes the results very excellent with only one loss in the past year according to backtest.  
  
Is the modifications you mentioned a further refinement to this system?

Im happy you are working on variations and even an EA. Thank you Irusoh, TeamAphid, Aktaurus, FXed2, Bluemiami and everyone. Really expecting to hear from you guys!  
  
Im forward testing the original system, some variations and on other timeframes. Ill let you know if I find anything interesting.

We are working on two different variations, one is using stepchoppy indicator and ATR channels only with modified rules and the other one is not using stepchoppy indicator (for the ones who are uncomfortable with the repainting feature of stepchoppy indicator), only ATR channels and Trend Power indicator.

Following rules are our modifications to pabloski system. They are only related to entry rules. We are going to explain modifications of SL and exit rules later.  
  
The main difference in entry compared to original pabloski is that we are not looking at the colour of previous bar to enter a trade as well as not waiting for a close between GREEN and AQUA ATR lines. Wherever the bar closes (up to 10 pips above AQUA ATR Line for longs and down to 10 pips below YELLOW ATR Line), if the bar colour changes to BLUE / RED, we see it as a strong indication of trend change and enter at close of that bar. Look at Jan 8th, 2007 12:00 bar entry instead of waiting for Jan 9th, 2007 08:00 bar original entry, 222 pips difference. Another example is on March 6th, 2007 00:00 bar, instead of original entry of March 8th, 2007 16:00 bar, 216 pips difference. Our backtest results show that this kind of entry improves the end result.  
  
Another main difference is that we are trading 4 lots instead of 3 to get better statistics and we did indeed.  
  
  
  
pabloski system entry rules modified by Team Aphid:  
  
Entry - Close above / below GREEN ATR line - NO ENTRY IF BAR CLOSES BELOW / ABOVE YELLOW / AQUA ATR LINE  
  
Special Condition 1 - If the close is 10 pips below / above YELLOW / AQUA ATR Line, then enter with 4 lots as if the price closes below / above AQUA / YELLOW ATR Line  
  
Special Condition 2 - If 4th lot exit is due to bar colour change (BLUE / RED), then reverse entry will be on the same bar (no need to wait for a close above / below GREEN ATR Line)  
  
Special Condition 3 - After exiting all 4 lots, you can reenter in the previous trade direction again if the bar colour triggers the trade(ie. You closed long position, after that if the bar colour turns to BLUE again and closes under AQUA ATR Line, then reenter with 4 lots to go long)

Count numbers of ATR lines from centre are:  
Aqua - # -1  
Green - # 0  
Orange - # +2  
So why do you use not equal distance from centre?

Thanks aktaurus for reminding, we have corrected our mistake in our original post and replaced ORANGE with YELLOW.

Team Aphid,  
  
You didn't say this in your summary, but must the bar close blue for a long and red for a short?

We did not modify pabloski's system that much drastic, lol. Yes, go long at close when the bar is blue and short when the bar is red.

To summarize these rules:  
  
for buy:  
\- enter on close any time 2 last bars are red to blue.  
\- enter when close is between green line and aqua line + 10pips and previous close was below green line.  
\- enter when close between green line and aqua line + 10 pips and last bar was blue and close before that was above green line.  
  
Please, confirm.

Yes, we did backtest EURJPY as well but we saw stepchoppy repaints itself a few times in a day.

Will do that later after getting feedback in regard to modified entry rules to allow people discuss different aspects of the system one at a time and to keep focused.

It's hard for me to understand these rules.  
  
So you enter buy between yellow and aqua lines +10 pips anytime you see a last blue bar?  
  
Can you write rules for _BUYS_ separately, otherwise it's a very confusing above/below business.

I know you didn't ask me, but I think I understand it-  
  
BUY  
Blue bar closes **between** the green and aqua lines OR blue bar closes **above** the aqua line- the close being no more than 10 pips above the aqua line.  
  
SELL  
Red bar closes **between** the green and yellow lines OR  
red bar closes **below** the yellow line- the close being no more than 10 pips below the yellow line.

Let's say you exited all 4 lots and you have no position. Whenever you see a close with Blue bar and as long as the close is below aqua line +10 pips, enter long, no matter where the bar is. Even if the bar close is between red and orange ATR lines, if it is blue at close, enter long. If you see the blue bar appeared at close and above aqua line +10 pips, then NO entry. Our assumption is that blue bar shows a strong trend change, so NO NEED to wait until we have a close between green and aqua ATR lines. But if the close is above aqua + 10 pips, we assume we are late to catch the trend and we are not entering long.  
  
Look at the yellow arrow on folllowing chart. The blue bar is between orange and red, so this is a buy signal, no need to wait until a close between green and aqua lines.  
  
Therefore;  
  
BUY when BAR COLOUR IS BLUE and CLOSE IS ANYWHERE BELOW AQUA ATR LINE +10 PIPS  
  
Sorry for the confusion, we hope it is clear now.

Wherever the bar closes (up to 10 pips above AQUA ATR Line for longs and down to 10 pips below YELLOW ATR Line), if the bar colour changes to BLUE / RED, we see it as a strong indication of trend change and enter at close of that bar. Look at Jan 8th, 2007 12:00 bar entry instead of waiting for Jan 9th, 2007 08:00 bar original entry, 222 pips difference. Another example is on March 6th, 2007 00:00 bar, instead of original entry of March 8th, 2007 16:00 bar, 216 pips difference. Our backtest results show that this kind of entry improves the end result.

Team Aphid, some questions :   
1\. You don't use the Trendpower on this new rules, do you?  
2\. If you enter using 4 lots, what is the rules to exit for this 4 lots?  
  
Thanks to you, and surely, to Pabloski, the originator of this system.

1- We have two modified versions, one with trend power and other one is without it. We will explain both. The first version that we just started to explain with entry rules will not include the use of trendpower.  
  
2- SL and exit rules will be explained later. Please read post #198 for the reasoning.

Ahhhh, anyone reminded of a primary Vegas 4h tunnel signal? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
I can see where Team Aphid got their idea from - stepchoppy turning blue is basically similiar to the 8 SMA changing the slope - there's been a change in trend, so we try to ride it as early as possible. Fake signals get compensated by the earlier entry.  
  
Nice idea and should really be better than waiting for a middle entry.  
  
This is also something I had wondered about in the high/low trending system of tkimble, who also uses a tunnel, but enters at the very outside boundary of it - the total opposite logic. You get guaranteed a late entry, because it tries to catch breakouts, but he tries to make up for it with a tiny stop.  
Here we try to get into changes early - sounds good to me, like I said, like the 4h Vegas tunnel logic.  
  
  
Not sure I've understood the SC 2 or the others yet, but that's most likely because I haven't put anything on my charts yet ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)  
Sorry. Wanted to wait until all of the kinks are out and the super-optimized Team Aphid version is finalized ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
Btw, that screenshot above looks like a DBLHC or BUOB(the first blue bar with the arrow) =bullish reversal. Price action can also help along here ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Just threw it on a chart here.   
  
Currently looking over entries mostly. Checking whether a simple "turns to Red or Dark Blue, stop just below/above the bar" approach works out okay.  
  
Placing stops so far away manages to keep you in if the startup is choppy, but it can also wind up costly...would be the question whether one offsets the other.   
  
Also it seems better to do the TP on a touch of the ATR lines, not on a close?  
Each blue hue being a quarter, the last quarter kept until we move back more than 2 ATR lines or color changes for example...  
  
I'm also wondering about entering again after lighter hue blues turn dark again..same for the reds.  
This might be what Team Aphid means with one of their special rules?  
I may have simply missed some stuff, I'm sorry, I'm trading alongside as I write this and cable just completely lost it, so 80% attention is somewhere else ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)

You're supposed to wait for the close of the bars as far as I know.  
  
Watching it on Alpari UK on the side, no problems just yet.

Hi all,  
  
As you know we are trying to improve pabloski system further. But today something important happened. As aktaurus indicated a few times, stepchoppy indicator is repainting and we believe our backtest results or anyone's backtest results cannot be correct.   
  
Please have a look at following two charts, and especially the last two bars. They are the same charts and saved within 10 minutes respectively. We were holding our short position @ 236.33 until today but a few hours ago, when GBPJPY started to climb, then current bar (08:00 bar) (now 12:00 bar is current) and previous bar (04:00 bar) were both yellow first, when the price passes 238.40 level, all of a sudden, last two bars became blue. Then when price retraced back towards 238 level, they became yellow again. If the price had climbed further and closed at let's say 238.70, the last two bars would have stayed as blue and according to original rules and our modified rules, we should have exited at close of 04.00 bar at 237.96 which was impossible at that time.   
  
We know trades are taken at the close of the bar, but since it also repaints previous bar, it is even impossible to forward test this system. Therefore, as Team Aphid, we are not going to use stepchoppy indicator in our modifications. Therefore, please discard our previous post explaining our modified entries.   
  
We said we are also working on another version of pabloski system which is not using stepchoppy indicator. It is still work in progress and whenever we finish it, if we satisfy with the test results, we are going to explain its rules in this thread again.  
  
Once again, stepchoppy indicator is unstable and cannot be backtested and forward tested properly and cannot be traded either.

That is why visual backtesting on MT backtester is very reliable. It shows in real time what is happeneing.  
I ran special stats on backtester and found that at the close of the bar there is never previous bar yellow, and that is they both turn blue at the same time so you are looking back at 2 blue bars.  
  
Anyway, here is my basic stepchoppy strategy, which you are welcome to test and comment on:  
  
It's very simple.  
Buy: on 4hour open when last bar is blue and 2nd bar is blue or dodgerblue or red.  
close buy on 4hour open when last bar is red, orange, tomato or yellow (its' not of blue colors).  
Sell: on 4hour open when last bar is red and 2nd bar is red or aqua or blue.  
close buy on 4hour open when last bar is blue, dodgerblue, lightblue or aqua (its' not of red colors).  
  
I don't use ATR channels at all.  
Oh, I adjusted kv=0.8, it seemed to work a little better.  
Here are some results of backtest with pabloski original system, and my system with variations using money management.

Basically I increase a size incementally say by 10-20% as i lose, so first loss is 1 lot, 2nd 1.2 lot, 3rd 1.4 and so on. You lose when price is ranging. Usually after 3-5 losses comes a big run so I get it all back and more.  
If you look at results, flat MM increased original size no more than 4-5 times and progressive about 10-12 times.  
With progressive after so many losses, say 4 or 5, I start increasing size in larger chunks instead of 0.2 by 0.4. Logic is the big run must be close.  
So let's say you lose 4 times, each time you add 0.2, now your size is 1.8  
on 5th time and forward you increase double so 1original + 5losses * 0.4 double increment = 3 lots next bet.  
I also decrease loss count by 2 every time I win.  
  
This is a rough cut, it could be refined, but it should work with winning strategy like this improving your results.

That's ok! But HOW then we can make a back test? How can we test your rules to start use it?  
  
Thanks for your ideas!

Nice to see your variations backtested! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Just a question: in my original system, did you include TrendPower filter?

No, I didn't use trendpower. This was the best try at imitation of the original rules.

Thanks for NOT repainting version. We are also backtesting this and compare it with repainting version to see the difference. Our first impression is that in most of the cases, they give signals on the same bars, but in some cases, NOT repainting one gives signal one bar later.  
  
Anyway, we'll test and share our results here.

Hi  
Please see the chart. The top section with price has Igorad's latest Step choppy V2. Note the first blue bar with the red horizontal line.  
At the bottom of the chart is the StepChoppyv1.3 and note the blue bar starts one bar previous. This does not happen all the time but it does occur.  
Regards TA

Can somebody tell me why my stepchoppy chart looks completely different?  
I wondered already last week why TeamAphid did not see blue bars.  
  
What are the settings to use forthe stepchoppy indicators?

Hi DanS  
It will be because you are using a different broker to Team Aphid. They are using Alpari Ru and it looks like you are on Interbankfx.  
Hope this helps.  
Cheers

Yes, it is the interbankfx live server.  
I would understand a difference in 1 bar or so when switching colors, but this looks entirely different.

That is exactly what I observed on the server, after close 2 yellow bars are repainted blue, that's why you always get blue/blue signal and never yellow/blue.

That would be great. Just make sure to include TrendPower filter. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Hi everyone,  
  
After "igorad" fixed repainting issue of stepchoppy indicator, we started working on pabloski again and we did many backtests last week. And we believe we now have a tradable version of pabloski with much lower drawdowns and better risk reward ratio.  
  
We are going to explain all details of our modified version of pabloski system and also send alerts for a while as soon as a signal is triggered so that you can walk with us to learn this system.   
  
Before we start explaining the system, first you need a correct setup of GBPJPY chart with required indicators.  
  
Use GBPJPY 4hr chart.  
  
You'll need all indicators attached on post # 2 by pabloski (this set of indicators includes repainting stepchoppy indi and we are going to use that one together with igorad's NOT repainting stepchoppy indi).  
  
You need to attach Trend Power indicator to your chart as well (go to post #162).  
  
You'll also need to attach NOT repainting version of Stepchoppy indicator (go to post #219).  
  
As a result of above attachments, your chart should look like as follows:

ENTRY RULES:  
  
1- For long trades, look at bar colours of stepchoppy (SC) indicators. If they are both blue AND they are below AQUA ATR Line + 10 pips (anywhere below it, NOT ONLY between GREEN and AQUA ATR Lines), then enter at the close or immediately at the open of next bar with 4 lots. Following charts show two examples of correct Long entries.  
  
Look at vertical white line and the close of the bars. Both pictures show that repainting (on the chart) and NOT repainting (the bottom window) versions of SC indicator changed the bar colour to BLUE at the same time, on the same bar (see assumption below). The place of bars is not important, in the first picture close of the bar is between GREEN and YELLOW ATR Lines. In the second picture, it is between ORANGE and RED ATR Lines.  
  
So we enter long with 4 lots at the close these bars or opening of the next bar by assuming downtrend ended and uptrend started because of BLUE bars.  
  
Another assumption here during backtesting was repainting version on the chart repainted previous bar to LIGHT BLUE (14/3/2007 08:00 bar) at the end of the BLUE line (14/3/2007 12:00 bar) in the first picture and corresponding bar in the second picture so that we had BLUE bars on both versions of the SC indicator. If this assumption is not true in real time, then we'll use another entry method which will be explained in the next post.

ENTRY RULES:  
  
2- Most of the time, BLUE bar on repainting version will not match the BLUE bar on NOT repainting version. Before we had NOT repainting version, we did backtests with repainting one and results were more than satisfactory. Therefore, if we can enter at the same level by using NOT repainting version, then we can duplicate those results. So, we have decided to enter a limit order at the close of the first BLUE bar of NOT repainting version by using the close of the first BLUE bar of repainting version.  
  
Have a look at the following chart. BLUE bars do not match, so when the price closed at 231.72, repainting version repainted the previous bar to BLUE, so we should have entered at 231.52, but we are one bar ahead now. Therefore, enter a limit BUY order at 231.52 with 4 lots when the price is at 231.72 and wait for your limit order to be filled. Your limit order was filled on 30/3/2007 00:00 bar at 231.52.  
  
What happens if price does not hit that limit entry level? Are we going to miss the trade? Of course not, please see next post for that.  
  
ps. we are using alpari ru. server for all our illustrations.

ENTRY RULES:  
  
3- Please have a look at the first chart. According to rule #2, we should put our buy limit order at 234.05 (close of 20/2/2007 08:00 bar) at the close of 12:00 bar. But look at the vertical white line (12:00 bar) where the value of Trend Power indicator is 0.14 at the close. In this case, we are not going to put a buy limit order at 234.05 and we will open a long position with 4 lots at 234.97 (close of 12:00 bar). So, before putting a limit buy order, you should look at the value of Trend Power indicator, if it is equal to or greater than 0.14, then you will buy at the close of the bar or open of the next bar, no need to put a limit order. In this example, the value of Trend Power indicator became 0.14 when NOT painting SC turned to BLUE.   
  
There are some cases it turns to BLUE a few bars later (look at the second chart). In that case, first put a limit buy order at the price of first BLUE bar of repainting SC and then watch Trend Power indicator. If your limit order is filled, then you are in position and no problem. If the price does not hit your limit order, then cancel your limit order and open a position at the close of the bar WHEN the value of Trend Power indicator is 0.14 or greater.

Thank you for this, Team Aphid.  
  
I'm anxious to see the exit rules.  
  
What you wrote applied only to long positions.  
  
I assume that shorts are just the opposite- red bars and a -.14 Trend Power reading. Correct?  
  
Thanks again.

Couple of questions, just to make sure,  
  
Must the previous non-repainting bar always be blue for a limit order entry?  
  
Must it be always blue for a TrendPower entry?  
  
With either a TrendPower entry or a limit order entry, must we still observe the Aqua+10 pips limitation?  
  
Thank You

We are not interested in the colour of previous non-repainting bar. But we are looking at it on repainting SC.  
  
For TrendPower entry, both non-repainting and repainting bars should be blue AND previous repainting bar should be blue as well. If not, since they are both blue, you will enter without checking TrendPower indicator - Entry Rule #1  
  
Yes, you will observe Aqua +10 pips limitation all the time.  
  
Btw, your assumption of shorts being just the opposite- red bars and a -.14 Trend Power reading is correct.  
  
But we have an observation here, red bars on repainting and non-repainting SC match all the time. Therefore, whenever you see a red bar on non-repainting SC, if it is above yellow -10 pips limitation, then you can go short.

TeamAphid, thanks for all your hard work and back/forward testing and development of this method!  
  
It seems that these news rules add a certain level of complexity to the system. Have you considered simply using the new non-repainting indicator the same as we used the repainting indicator before? Could the loss in pips due to entering one or two bars later be that much? In your last post in this chart ( [http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...9&d=1178363236](http://www.forexfactory.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=30669&d=1178363236) ), we missed over 100 pips because we waited for the price to retrace to the previous bar's close, and if we had just placed our long order when the non-repainting indicator bar turned blue, then we would have made many more pips.  
  
It just seems that trying to get this to match the previous indicator's entries is a long way around what should be a shorter path. Am I missing something, or do I not understand, or...?  
  
Also, looking forward to SL and exit rules!

I've taken the newest entry criteria from TeamAphid and consolidated it into the following... TeamAphid, please check these for validity:  
  
==============================================  
SCv1 = Repainting version of indicator (the one on the price)  
SCv2 = Non-repainting version of indicator (the one in the separate window)  
  
Long entry:  
  
In all cases, the previous bar close must be below the aqua line + 10 pips.  
  
Wait for a blue bar on SCv2.  
  
(1) If the corresponding bar on SCv1 is the first blue bar, or if the TrendPower indicator is >= 0.14, (or both, obviously), enter long now. Entry is done.  
  
(2) Else, if there are prior blue bars on SCv1 and the TrendPower indicator is < 0.14, place a buy limit order at the closing price of the first blue bar on SCv1.  
  
Check the charts at the next bar close.  
- If this closed bar caused the buy limit order to get filled, our entry is done.  
- If the buy limit is still open, and if TrendPower is >= 0.14, enter long (and obviously, cancel the buy limit order)—entry done. Else, wait until next bar close and recheck.  
  
Obviously, if a non-blue-shaded bar appears, we abort our entry.

We have considered simply using the new non-repainting indicator the same as we used the repainting indicator before and we already backtested it. The reason why we were trying to match the previous indicator's entries is that there was approximately 6,000 pips difference in 15 months of backtesting period if we could have entered with repainting indicator's signal. But instead of using our 3 entry rules (limit orders, trend power entry etc.), if you use the new non-repainting indicator for entry (BUY when the bar is blue AND the close is below aqua atr +10 or vice versa), you will get 465 pips less compared to our entry rules, it is not actually a big deal.   
  
Therefore, for the sake of simplicity, we agree with you using just non-repainting SC blue and red bars for entries.  
  
We'll post SL and exit rules asap.  
  
Thanks for your contribution.

EXIT RULES - SL and TPs:  
  
Assume we are LONG 4 lots.  
  
1- If the entry is between yellow and green atr lines, then SL for all lots will be a close below yellow atr line.  
  
2- If entry is below yellow atr line, then SL will be bar colour change to red (there was no such a case during backtesting, we mean if entry is below yellow atr line, all trades closed in positive, gained big pips).  
  
3- If entry is between green and aqua atr lines, then SL will be touch of green atr line (this rule considerably reduced big losses and drawdowns, though caused only a few trades missing).  
  
4- First lot take profit (TP) - close between aqua and dodger blue atr lines.  
  
Exception 1- If entry is below green atr line, then do not wait for a close between green and aqua atr lines, exit the first lot when the price  
touches aqua atr line.  
  
Exception 2- If entry is within 10 pips of aqua atr line (bothsides), then   
exit the first lot when price touches dodger blue atr line.  
  
5- Second lot TP - when the price touches dodger blue atr line.  
  
6- Third lot TP - when the price touches blue atr line.  
  
7- Fourth lot TP - After exiting 3rd lot with profit, trail the fourth lot with green atr line, whenever price touches green atr line, exit the fourth lot.  
  
8-After exiting first lot, SL for all remaining lots will be touch of green atr line. Same is applicable if first and and second lots are exited at profit and price touches back to green atr line.  
  
9- We are not using reentry strategy during the same cycle (during the same uptrend or downtrend).

Hi TeamAphid. Thank you for your hard work and great contributions.  
  
Have you backtested the system with these modified settings?  
  
By the way, I started testing your signals and last week performance was simply excellent (only using 1st TPs).  
  
Keep up the good work!

You are welcome, pabloski. We thank you for this thread. We modified your original rules a little bit to get better results and statistics, sorry for that.  
  
Yes, we have backtested the system with modified rules (actually, we have been testing your system since you put this thread on action) and the results are just fantastic (actually the results were even better with the repainting SC, but we cannot use it alone).  
  
Please see our next post for results and statistics.  
  
Thanks again.

Thats great. Everything is better when we work together ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1). Ill change thread title (anyone can tell me how to do so? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)) to: "Pabloski System Modified by TeamAphid" or we may just make a new one with modified rules.  
  
Also, have you fund that 0.14 value is the best for TrendPower indicator? Or you just considered my filter as-is? During my backtest, that value seemed to be the best one but other values looked interesting too.

Please see attached spreadsheeet for results. We used our own entry rules. But you can use joshdance's entry rule which is much more simple, it costs only several hundred pips.

Pabloski, no need to change the name of the thread or make a new one, it is all yours, we are just trying to contribute and help FF members. Thanks, anyway, for the offer.  
  
Actually we tried only 0.15, but it seems 0.14 is good enough. But if you use "joshdance's" entry rule, then no need to use TrendPower indicator.

Well, I hate to throw away pips, but given my schedule, a quick glance at the charts might be worth the small pip loss, but I'll give it a try both ways!

Awesome, I can't wait to try this strategy out... my only concern is, looking at the last backtest data from TeamAphid, the last three trades have been negative, for somewhere around 700 pips... that would be a very discouraging start to any system... but hey, I guess that means that it's due for a profitable trade verrrry soon :-)

You are welcome JoshDance. We have another recommendation. If the first blue bar of non-repainting SC is below yellow atr line, then enter immediately at the close of this bar to save some pips. If it is anywhere between yellow atr line and aqua +10 pips, then you use our 3 different entry rules. We are sure this kind of entry strategy will add some more pips to the end result.  
  
We are also going to post our trades here.

The reason you have better win/loss ratio is you are bringing remaining lots immediately to BE after first TP together with very wide stoploss you use. We also use similar strategy (even tighter one, because we are not waiting for first TP to be filled and we define our SL as green atr line immediately), but we think this strategy makes the difference (reduces losses and drawdowns and improves profit factor considerably). 4.89:1 profit factor is incredible, in our opinion.

Yes, last three trades have been negative with -612 pips and it is the maximum drawdown this system has so far since Jan 06. Compared to profit factor and win/loss ratio, this is really nothing. There are many people who are trying to trade systems with 40% win/loss ratio with 1.5:1 profit factor. And don't forget, this is GBPJPY, wild west ride of forex market.  
  
When we have time, we are considering to backtest GBPUSD and EURJPY as well.

TeamAphid, regarding the new rules. I'm making a matrix of how to handle stops/exits/tp's, and I have a couple of questions:  
  
1) Does a red bar take precedence over all other exit/TP rules? IE, if in a long trade and a bar suddenly turns red, we take all profits/losses and exit all positions?  
  
2) When you say that a SL is at the green ATR line, do you mean that the stop will trail up and not move back down, or that the stop needs to move up AND down with the green line?  
  
In Rule #8, you say:

> Quote
> 
> Disliked
> 
> 8-After exiting first lot, SL for all remaining lots will be touch of green atr line. (Does this mean that the SL's trail? I assume so.) Same is applicable if first and and second lots are exited at profit and price touches back to green atr line. (Could you explain what you mean here?)

  
3) For rule #7, you specify TP for lot #4, but in actuality, we just trail the SL along the green line and let it hit, right? So we never manually TP on lot #4, correct?  
  
Thanks for any clarifications you can provide--when I get my rule matrix finished later tonight, I'll post it and you guys, if you don't mind, can offer any corrections to it. I'm trying to get the rules in a fairly 'dummy-proof' format--my brain will overload if I have to think too much every 4 hours hehe :-)

TeamAphid,  
  
Maybe this rule should be modified slightly for the case where a blue bar closes just a few, say 5, pips above the green line?

In practice, if a blue bar closes just a few pips above the green line, for a currency like GBPJPY, it is almost certain that you will be stopped out. Therefore, we think every trader should put a safety margin before using this rule. So, we agree with you about modifying this rule.  
  
Another recommendation could be if you are stopped out at green atr line and then if you see a close BELOW green atr line, then you can reenter although we are not using reentering strategy normally. By doing so, you will have a second chance with much better risk reward ratio. Please see attached chart for such a case.

Here are the rules for managing a long trade. Hopefully they are correct... TeamAphid, I've tried to get things correct here. Let me know of changes!

Why do the rules allow such an entry if its almost certain to get stopped out?

Because we did not want to limit traders by saying "if entry is below green atr +50 or +30, then SL will be below yellow line". There were only a couple cases in backtest period which had very close entry to green atr line and we did not take those trades. Therefore, for this rule, every trader should put a safety margin between green atr line and entry price according to their risk profile and apply green atr line stop. If entry is below that margin, then use "a close below yellow atr line" stop.

As you see from the attached chart, both repainting and non-repainting SC indi. gave Sell signal today on the same bar, but since the close is below yellow atr line, we passed this trade. Now we are waiting for a blue bar to form to enter long (please see entry rules).

There was also a failed long trade that occurred since you posted your new rules.

If you mean either 7/5 04:00 or 9/5 08:00 bars, they don't qualify as long trades since we are not entering in the middle of a cycle. For us, the cycle began at 27/4 08:00 bar (although it is repainting bar, we take that into consideration) and since the price was above aqua + 10 pips at the close of 12:00, we passed that trade. For such cases, we are waiting for a red bar to go short. We are not taking long signals in between.

What defines a cycle?  
What begins and ends a cycle?

Since we are not using reentry strategy as in the original pabloski rules, cycles starts when you get a signal in opposite direction of the previous signal. It does not matter if that signal is qualified to take the trade or not. For example, the cycle started on 27/4 08:00 bar, though we did pass this trade as we saw the beginning of cycle at the end of the next bar due to repainting issue of SC and it was above aqua +10 pips. Then cycle continues until we see a red bar (10/5 12:00 bar, sell signal) (does not matter if you are in the trade or not), therefore we are not taking any trades in between.  
  
Look at 19/4 04:00 bar where the cycle started. We were stoppped out on 19/4 16:00 bar according to grean atr exit rule and then we passed next short signal (23/4 04:00 bar), because cycle started and ended with stop-out. So cycles ends with stop-out or in other terms, exiting all lots with either profit or loss. Then next cycle should start with opposite trade direction, in this case 27/4 08:00 blue bar.

By my count, the last "good" trade to enter was 29/3 16:00. This was a blue bar, and it fit all the criteria. The 19/4 04:00 bar was not a good idea to enter although it fit the criteria, because it was nothing more than a higher low in a strong uptrend. Patience would have paid off in not taking that trade. Just not a good idea.  
  
Now, however, we've been in a bit of a consolidation phase for the last several weeks, and hopefully new trending will start soon. As has been said before, this system works well in trending markets, but not so well in ranging ones.

You cannot enter on 29/3 16:00 bar, because you see that blue bar at the close of 20:00 bar due to repainting issue. If you use non-repainting SC ONLY to enter (not our 3 different entry methods), then you can enter at the open of 30/3 00:00 bar which is 231.73 (we don't take spread into consideration). Now the question is what will be your stoploss? If you use green atr line, then you were stopped out at the same bar. If you use original pabloski stop rules, will you be able to withstand 119 pips x 4 = 476 pips drawdown? And if you use original strategy, then our backtests showed that drawdown is much higher and profit is less. We are just trying to understand how you will trade mechanically this system.   
  
The same is true for 19/4 04:00 bar. How do you know this bar was not the end of uptrend when it closed? Then you shouldn't take short trade on 12/3 12:00 bar with the same approach. What we mean here if you use discretion to take trades, we believe you will end up with a completely different system and/or results. That is the danger of using discretion in mechanical systems. If entry/exit or stoploss fits all the criteria, then one should take the trade if the system will be traded 100% mechanically.  
  
We have integrated green atr stop and not reentry strategies to minimise losses in ranging markets and as a result we got very high profit factor with very reasonable drawdown for such a volatile currency.

Thanks for the heads-up edashan! I'm going to monitor this on my account but I don't think I'm going to take the trade, as I'm not going to follow this system as mechanically as it was intended. The pretty highly tested R area at 239.67 makes me concerned that it might not take off. But for the sake of all who take the trade, I hope it does!!

Yes, we are long at 238.93 + spread with trailing stoploss at green atr line.

We are trading 4 lots and long at 238.97 including 4 pips spread. Aqua ATR Line is at 239.2851 and we have 30 minutes to close the current bar. If we see a close at 239.29 or above, we are going to exit first lot and the stoploss of remaining lots will be green atr line. We'll keep you updated.

Hi, TeamAphid, you said in post #251 below,  
  
_Exception 2- If entry is within 10 pips of aqua atr line (bothsides), then  
exit the first lot when price touches dodger blue atr line._  
__  
So I think we need to wait the price touch dodger blue atr line to exit 1st lot.

That rule is not applicable for current trade. Because we have entered at 238.93 + 4 pips spread at 16/5 16:00 bar. Someone recommended an alternative entry when non-repainting SC triggers signal which was at the close of 16/5 12:00, we are not using that entry method. If you use it, then, your point is correct.

We exited 1st lot at the close of 17/5 12:00 bar from 239.40 with 43 pips net profit and trailing the remaining 3 lots with green atr line which is at 238.65 at the moment (entry was at 238.93 + 4 pips spread).   
  
Our profit target for the 2nd lot is at 240.12 right now, the level of dodger blue atr line. Please keep in mind that these levels keep changing in both directions with price. Therefore, you need to trail them.

If you use plain technical analysis methods like S/R and trendlines, we agree that there is a strong resistance between 239.60 - 239.75 zone. But we prefer trading this method 100% mechanically as we do in our other systems. We don't use any discretion after setting the rules for a system.

I agree.   
There is always a technical analysis reason to stay out of any trade.  
If something works, leave it alone.  
If you don't, you'll "improve" it out of existence.

I try to refrain from using absolutes like always and never. I don't find it to be useful in trading. I am short GBP/JPY precisely because of the huge resistance shown.  
  
With respect to following a mechanical system blindly...I would suggest entering a smaller position size near strong support and resistance.  
  
There are usually compelling reasons why price is reacting in these areas.

Our long position on GBPJPY was stopped out at 238.71. So, the trade result is -35 pips for 4 lots (+43, -26, -26, -26) including [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide"). Now we are waiting for a red bar to go short. We are not going to reenter long if we see a blue bar again.

hi team aphid....from my analysis....the trade you've entered its a no trade if its base on pabloski filter rules using the trend power...becoz the trend power doesn,t exceed the 0.14 value....so i didnt take the trade.....sorry if i were wrong....just sharing my 2cent

If you use that filter, you are correct. But we are not using pabloski's rules, we have modified all entry, SL and exit rules and trade accordingly.

hey teamaphid,  
  
Your original 3 sets of entry rules, uses repainting indicator.but i thought you had mentioned that if it does repaint, you can not rely on backtests. then how can u trust the backtesting results?

We sent that post on 5/5 and since then we had only one long entry which matched Entry rule 2, therefore we had no opportunity to test this assumption.   
  
Actually, it is not that important whether this assumption is true or not. Because, at the end of the day, the number of long entry cases which match entry rule 1 is only a few and it will have negligible effect on backtest results.

The reason why we were trying to match the previous indicator's entries is that there was approximately 6,000 pips difference in 15 months of backtesting period if we could have entered with repainting indicator's signal. But instead of using our 3 entry rules (limit orders, trend power entry etc.), if you use the new non-repainting indicator for entry (BUY when the bar is blue AND the close is below aqua atr +10 or vice versa), you will get 465 pips less compared to our entry rules, it is not actually a big deal.

I am a bit confused.....there is a 6000 pips difference between repainting one's result using original pabloski rules or your 3 sets of rules?

We are not using repainting indicator.  
  
Entry 1 looks at it, if they both match, then we enter, this means entry depends on non-repainting SC here. Because non-repainting SC lags, we use this entry after confirming the blue bar on non-repainting SC.  
  
Entry 2 looks at it to determine entry level, but after we see repainted blue bar. When do we look at it? After we see blue bar on non-repainting SC.  
  
Entry 3 happens after Entry 2 case is realised.  
  
As you can see, we base our entry criteria on non-repainting SC. Without confirming blue bar on non-repainting SC, we take no action and our backtests results are reliable and correct.

Sorry for confusion. We didn't say there was a 6000 pips difference __if you use repainting one's result using original pabloski rules.__   
  
As you know, we have started to post entry rules by using repainting indicator previously (at that time we hadn't observed live the indicator repainted itself on GBPJPY) and then when we observed it really repainted itself, we posted an important notice saying we were not using this indicator.  
When we started posting those entry rules, we had finished backtesting with repainting SC and the results were plus 22000 something pips. After repainting issue was fixed we tried to match entry rules which we used for repainting one by using non-repainting SC to decrease 6000 pips difference between __our backtest results with our modified rules using ONLY repainting SC and our backtest results with our modifed rules using non-repainting SC (current rules).__  
  
Original pabloski rules will produce totally different results with both repainting and non-repainting SC which will have bigger drawdowns and less pips.

Ok....here are the Teamaphid/Joshdance rules...A simplified version. Its actually longer than Teamaphid's version but its very simple in a sense that I divided all the rules into 8 sections. section 1-4 are for long...and section 5-8 are for short. I have used Joshdance's entry rules and Team aphid's exit and SL rules. when you see a red or blue bar forming...quickly go to the section that applies to that situation and thats the only section you need to refer to. Teamaphid, Please feel free to make any modifications you see necessary. I can also post this into word format if anybody wants.   
  
  
  
ATR Legend  
1st one from top: Blue  
2nd one: dodgeblue  
3rd: Aqua  
4th: green  
5th: yellow  
6rh: orange  
7th: red  
  
  
  
ENTRY:  
  
LONG ENTRY On the first Blue bar AND the close is below aqua atr +10   
  
SHORT ENTRY/SELL: Closed Bar is Red and above yellow-10   
  
Pasted from <[http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...=23592&page=17](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=23592&page=17)>   
  
  
9- We are not using reentry strategy during the same cycle (during the same uptrend or downtrend).  
cycles starts when you get a signal in opposite direction of the previous signal. It does not matter if that signal is qualified to take the trade or not  
  
**EXIT RULES - SL and TPs:**  
  
  
  
RULE SET 1: IF LONG ENTRY IS BELOW YELLOW LINE   
  
-> Stop loss will be bar color change to red(there was no such a case during backtesting, we mean if entry is below yellow atr line, all trades closed in positive, gained big pips).  
  
First Lot exit: the first lot when the price touches aqua atr line.  
  
After exiting first lot, SL for all remaining lots will be touch of green atr line  
  
Second lot TP - when the price touches dodger blue atr line  
  
Third lot TP - when the price touches blue atr line  
  
Fourth lot TP - After exiting 3rd lot with profit, trail the fourth lot with green atr line, whenever price touches green atr line, exit the fourth lot  
  
RULE SET 2: IF LONG ENTRY BETWEEN YELLOW AND GREEN LINE  
  
-> Initial stop loss will be close below Yellow ATR Line/But a Red bar takes Precedence over any other stop loss  
  
Exit the first lot when the price touches aqua atr line.  
  
After exiting first lot, SL for all remaining lots will be touch of green atr line  
  
Second lot TP - when the price touches dodger blue atr line.  
  
Third lot TP - when the price touches blue atr line.  
  
Fourth lot TP - After exiting 3rd lot with profit, trail the fourth lot with green atr line, whenever price touches green atr line, exit the fourth lot.  
  
RULE SET 3 IF LONG ENTRY BETWEEN GREEN AND AQUA LINE  
  
SL will be touch of green ATR Line/But a Red bar takes Precedence over any other stop loss  
  
First lot: close between aqua and dodger blue atr lines  
  
After exiting first lot, SL for all remaining lots will be touch of green atr line.  
  
Second lot TP - when the price touches dodger blue atr line.  
  
Third lot TP - when the price touches blue atr line.  
  
Fourth lot TP - After exiting 3rd lot with profit, trail the fourth lot with green atr line, whenever price touches green atr line, exit the fourth lot.  
  
In practice, if a blue bar closes just a few pips above the green line, for a currency like GBPJPY, it is almost certain that you will be stopped out. Therefore, we think every trader should put a safety margin before using this rule. So, we agree with you about modifying this rule.  
Another recommendation could be if you are stopped out at green atr line and then if you see a close BELOW green atr line, then you can reenter although we are not using reentering strategy normally. By doing so, you will have a second chance with much better risk reward ratio. Please see attached chart for such a case.  
  
RULE SET 4: IF LONG ENTRY BETWEEN AQUA AND +10 LINE  
  
exit the first lot when price touches dodger blue atr line/But a Red bar takes Precedence over any other stop loss  
  
After exiting first lot, SL for all remaining lots will be touch of green atr line. Same is applicable if first and and second lots are exited at profit and price touches back to green atr line.  
  
Second lot TP - when the price touches dodger blue atr line.  
  
Third lot TP - when the price touches blue atr line.  
  
Fourth lot TP - After exiting 3rd lot with profit, trail the fourth lot with green atr line, whenever price touches green atr line, exit the fourth lot.  
  
  
RULE SET 5: IF SHORT ENTRY IS ABOVE AQUA LINE - all positions will be exited if bars turn to BLUE  
  
-> FOR SHORT STOP LOSS WILL BE BAR COLOR CHANGE TO BLUE  
  
exit the first lot when the price touches YELLOW atr line.  
  
After exiting first lot, SL for all remaining lots will be touch of green atr line.  
  
Second lot TP - touches ORANGE ATR LINE  
  
Third lot TP - when the price touches RED ATR LINE  
  
Fourth lot TP - After exiting 3rd lot with profit, trail the fourth lot with green atr line, whenever price touches green atr line, exit the fourth lot  
  
  
RULE SET 6: IF SHORT ENTRY BETWEEN AQUA AND GREEN LINE  
  
-> Initial stop loss will be close ABOW AQUA ATR Line/But a Blue bar takes Precedence over any other stop loss  
  
Exit the first lot when the price touches Yellow atr line.  
  
After exiting first lot, SL for all remaining lots will be touch of green atr line  
  
Second lot TP - touches ORANGE ATR LINE  
  
Third lot TP - when the price touches RED ATR LINE  
  
Fourth lot TP - After exiting 3rd lot with profit, trail the fourth lot with green atr line, whenever price touches green atr line, exit the fourth lot  
  
RULE SET 7 SHORT ENTRY BETWEEN GREEN AND YELLOW LINE  
  
SL will be touch of green ATR Line/But a Blue bar takes Precedence over any other stop loss

Third lot TP - when the price touches RED ATR LINE

RULE SET 8 IF SHORT ENTRY BETWEEN AQUA AND +10 LINE OR YELLOW -10  
  
exit the first lot when price touches Orange ATR Line/But a Blue bar takes Precedence over any other stop loss  
  
After exiting first lot, SL for all remaining lots will be touch of green atr line.  
  
Second lot TP - touches ORANGE ATR LINE

Hello Traders,  
  
does this method have a templete with all the indicators setup in it? or one simply has to include all the indicators in the chart. Also, how does one search for indicators, jpgs, etc.. in this forum without having to go thru every page.  
  
Regards,  
  
Graham

Go to the forum page where you see the thread, click the little paper clip icon, and that will show you all the attachments on the thread. Since this thread is only 20 pages long, however, it should take you only maybe half an hour or so to take an initial skim through and find all the indicators you want.

Just one small change...rule set 8 I changed to between yellow and yellow -10 instead of aqua+10 as the rule set 8 is for short entry.

Hi there,  
  
thanks for all this info and also the detailed explanation. it would be good if some of it was shown graphically, but, thanks again. So, the recommended currencies are GBP/JPY and EUR/JPY? and the best time frame is 4H?  
  
regards,  
  
Graham

Graham,   
  
I will post screenshots very soon. however, I have a problem while doing some backtesting. I hope teamaphid or joshdance or someone who has tried to backtest this system could help. I think the rule for going short is when stepchoppy indicator is red which means strong downtrend in the legend. I dont see any red bars on that indicator!!! actually, I am not good wth clolors so i just look at the legend to see if strong downtrend becomes 1. I saw from 01/2004 to -05/2004...and not even a single short entry!!! do you guys have a small problem?

I see, so when you look for going short, you are not looking for strong downtrend value to be 1, you are looking for retrace uptrend value to be 1. rigth?

We are not looking at any values. We just check bar colours as explained in rules.

Did you go beyond post #1 and see updated indicators, etc.?  
  
It might be helpful to post a picture of your chart.

Friends,  
  
I dont know if someone has tried to backtest this strategy. I am done with backtesting 4 months, Jan 2004-April 2004. This strategy has been performing negatively in all four months. At the end of April - -20% drawdown. I actually didnt consider the trades where SL was too close to entry. Because as mentioned by teamaphid and others, its most likely gonna stop out. and thats true, they all did stop out for loss. I will still continue the backtesting untill the end of 2004 but this worries me a bit. attached are the backtest results.  
  
Its done using Alpari datafeed.

thanks alot, i sorted it out already, now i can see coloured bars.  
  
BTW does the bar repaint itself? when the bar open, does it keep painting itself with different colour until it finally close after 4 hours? and also does bars that have closed, will it repaint if u close and restart MT4?  
  
BTW i backtested it from GJ Jan 2007 to May 2007, all months are profitable with Jan 2007 earning 1900 pips that month alone.

what rules did u use? there are like 3-4 different entry and exit rules. did u use   
  
1 - original pabloski rules?  
2 - team aphid version 1 using repainting indicator?  
3 -team aphid version 2?  
  
I used team pahid version 2 but for entry rules I use joshdance's simple rules.

i use the original pabloski rule, but there are loses as well. i mean profitable is in term of end month (win minus lose).  
  
  
BTW since the introduction of non painting stepchoppybars, does it means that backtesting with it is reliable already?

DID YOU use original rules with the repainting indiactor? if you did, then read the whole thread. I dont think those backtests are reliable. I just finished 2 more months...and I am coming up negative for ALL SIX MONTHS!!! at about 30% drawdown at the end of six months! if somebody would like to recheck it please! I want to believe in this system but the results speak otherwise.   
  
its done using joshdance entry rules, and teamaphid exit rules, alpari datafeed, January 2004-June 2004.

Please go back and read through the whole thread. You'll find answers about repainting. It's only 20-something pages, you can read that and find these things out in an hour.

Hi Zalak,  
  
We should test it properly with our own modified rules, when we finish (it may take a while), we'll inform you.

Ok acutally, I will do it with your entry rules. I used your exit rules but josh' entry rules as you had mentioned there is not that much diff in performance. I will email you results in a week or so. I will not take trades that were very close to stop loss and just put a note with a date and time of the candle.

Hi everybody,

  
When I tried to compile TrendPower.mq4 I got a message “semicolon unexpected”. The problem is that I can’t delete the semicolon, because MetaEditor generates a message “Access is denied”. How do you guys deal with “Access is denied” ? Thanks a lot ! scardi   
=============================  
Sorry guys, I found out the reason.It has to do with indicator's folder attributes.

I wrote an indicator called ToR 1.02 that will help with pabloski or any other trading system. It uses ADX on multiple timeframes to let you know if you are in a ranging or trending market.   
  
I started a thread for ToR here:

We are long @ 240.33 with 4 lots and since entry is below green ATR line, our initial SL for 4 lots will be a close below yellow ATR line.

It was not qualified as a short trade because the close was even under orange ATR line.

We exited first lot at 241.43 ([oanda](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile") price) with +110 pips profit. Stoploss for remaining 3 lots is at 240.39 (green ATR Line) as of this post which means we locked +110 + 3 x 6 = +128 pip profit.   
  
We'll keep updating this trade.

Team Aphid,   
  
Was this trade entered on a limit because repainting indicator showed blue 1 bar before the non-repainting indicator?

It was a spike on Alpari. Today's actual high is 242.36 as of this post. So we are still holding 3 lots. Modify 00:00 bar's high to 242.09 from History Center on mt4, because high price error on that bar is affecting ATR levels.

We exited second lot at 242.62 (oanda price) with +229 pips profit.  
  
Stoploss for remaining 2 lots is at 240.92 (green ATR Line) and 3rd lot TP is at 243.49 as of this post which means we locked  
  
+110 + 229 + (2 x 59) = + 457 pips profit.   
  
We'll keep updating this trade.

Thanks to Pabloski and Team Aphid for their system and generosity![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f647-200d-2642-fe0f.png?v=15.1). A great tend following system. When backtesting 2004 I can't see these short entries. The first entry I can see is on the 03/09/2004 2000 bar. Just to clarify a short entry occurs when there is a closed red bar and above yellow -10?

We still see them, maybe you are not using Alpari server.

Yes I'm using the Alpari data but those candles aren't red using this data. I'll check again.

This is from Jan 2004 using Alpari UK and Step Choppy v 2. I get the same as Team Aphid.  
Hope this helps.

Hi Antra, thanks for your reply. The difference could be to do with the historical data I'm using. MT4 I think warns you that downloaded history data can differ from the data on the trade server, because its coming from the MetaQuotes Software Corp history centre. I'll try downloading directly from Alpari, hopefully that should fix it. Cheers

I'm now using Alpari data and still getting different results. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f615.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/2753.png?v=15.1) The only difference I can see is the StepSize value is 113 in the corner. I'm using stepchoppybars_v2 with default valuesand stepchoppy_v2. Does this setting need to be changed? I would really like to backtest this system and any help would be greatly appreciated.

Hi  
How frustrating for you. There must be something wrong...let's see if we can work it out!  
  
StepChoppyBars_v2 settings are:-  
  
Length 10  
Kv 1.0  
Step size 0.0  
MA Mode 0  
HighLow false  
Step Size Fast 5.0  
Step Size slow 15.00  
  
Same as yours?  
If this does not fix it then please PM me.  
Cheers  
Antra

Previously, we exited 3 lots with 768 pips profit. We are still holding 4th lot and with the current rate of 247.55, we are up +722 pips on this one. Current level of green ATR line is at 245.26 which means we locked   
  
+768 + 493 = +1261 pips for this trade.  
  
We'll keep updating this trade.

Hello Pabloski/Team Aphid and others,  
  
Please clarify my picture. This is from Alpari Demo Chart.   
The ellipse part of the picture is colored red. This picture I took after I re-install Windows on my computer.   
Before I re-install my computer, I firmly believe, very firm, that ellipse part was not even red. It was light blue, or blue something.  
I am really - really sure of it.  
  
Is there any repainting issue on this case? Thanks  
  
Regards

Here is my chart. This is Alpari Ru data feed. Indicator is StepChoppyBars_v2.  
There has been known to be some difference with Alpari UK and Alpari Ru.

I see your step size is different. Mine is 113.  
  
Setting:-  
Length 10  
Kv 1.0  
Step size 0.0  
MAMode0  
HighLow False  
Step size fast 5.00  
Step size slow 15.00  
  
  
  
I have been watching this indicator for a few weeks now and I have not seen any repainting.  
The earlier Step Choppy did repaint.  
Hope this helps  
Cheers

Antra, I see your chart and I am now sure that I am not wrong. I don't know how, but before I re-install my computer, my chart looks like the same with you. See, from your chart, the ellipse part of my chart should be the same color with you. But after I re-install the Alpari, it suddenly change color.  
  
Antra, Would you mind to tell me how to subscribe to Alpari.RU Server? IF you don't mind also, would you please attach your template so I can be sure that my setting is correct.  
  
Thanks

Hi  
Here is the Alpari Ru site

make sure you save it to a different folder as well.  
  
  
and I have attached the template I use.

Please read Post #240 on page 16 by TeamAphid. On that Post, Team Aphid mentioned clearly the indicators which are needed to build up the system, including on which posts the indicator was attached. Make sure you have all the indicators, not just the stepchoppybar itself (as stepchoppybar is also built from some indicators). It seems that you might lost one or more indicators which are needed to draw stepchoppybars on your chart.

Hi all  
  
I have read this entire thread but at the end i was realy confused, because this method develops in so many stages. Wich rules are the good ones for this system ? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f615.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/2753.png?v=15.1)

Hi everyone!  
  
I've been through the thread once and about to go back for another re-read, but thought I'd check in and see if I am starting to see things correctly or not? Does the current setup warrant a valid long Pabloski entry using the simplified rules of JoshDance? I have the NON-repaint StepChoppy v2 indicator only. Any feedback would be great!  
  
Thanks to everyone for their input along the way and to Pabloski for sharing. No doubt I will be back with more questions soon!

I know it can be confusing to understand ...things progressed in the thread as it was discovered the original Step choppy repainted. You can have a look at the backtested results in post 255 and read the Team Aphid rules and then follow them up with Joshdances modified rules AND you you can follow what is happening here in this thread as I think Team Aphid will be posting trades or if they are asleep then someone will.  
  
Fresian  
...yes there is a signal to go long. It's not too late for anyway to get in as price has not moved too far away from the entry 28/6/7 bar 20.00 246.68 plus spread. 4 lots with target 1 being a close above the aqua line, target 2 being a touch on the dodger blue, target 3 a touch of the blue and fourth target being touch of the central green line...if we are lucky enough to have a nice run like that.  
Stop loss is the yellow line.  
Cheers

Thanks Antra.   
  
One thing I was a little unsure of was the rule of no entry on the same cycle, but looking back it appeared that there may have been a short since the last long trade depending on your level of discretion? The close of the red bar on 2007.07.27 00:00 was probably a little more than 10pips below yellow line so maybe not technically a short? How do others interpret this rule?

I have been testing this strategy on a couple of different brokers & getting very different results. The picture below shows why: the latest long entry (at close of v2 blue bar) is 100 points different: 245.68 on Moneytec, 246.68 on Alpari.

According to JoshDance's simplified rules, it is a valid long at 246.68. According to our rules, we are still pending at 246.47 with a limit Buy order.

The recent long is valid and it is not on the same cycle since a red bar appeared previously. We are not looking for a red bar to be a valid short entry, as long as it appears, we accept a new cycle begins. Therefore recent long entry is valid as it comes after a red bar cycle.

No, we are not. We put a limit order at 246.47 after 28/6 20:00 bar closed. But our buy order was not filled with a couple of pips. Now we are waiting for a new cycle which will begin with a red bar and we'll see if it will be a valid signal.

hi bhatiaashish007,  
  
this is a Windows issue. Just right clicks on your file and choose rename, then delete the uneeded caracters. You should have the indicator name like this: StepChoppyBars_v2.mq4 for version 2  
  
Same thing for the indicator if you want to use it : StepChoppy_v2.mq4  
  
Hapy trading,

I think I am finally getting my head around it all now, I just wanted to check a couple of more things.   
  
Aphid - from post #251 the first lot TP is between aqua and dodger blue atr lines. From this I wanted to see if the exception 1 was correct or should it be, "Exception 1 - If entry is below green atr line, then do not wait for a close between aqua and blue atr lines, exit the first lot when the price touches aqua atr line"?

And looking back on the previous winning Long trade entered on 2007.06.12 at 240.33 (attached), by using the Aphid rules and entering on a Limit order you entered below the green line, giving more room for the trade to move as the SL was the yellow atr line (red arrow in pic). However if you were to use just StepChoppyV2 and trade without discretion (ie no re-entries) then you would have been stopped out of this trade and missed the big run?  
  
I like the simplicity of JoshDance's suggestion of trading just StepChoppyv2, however the extra pips on trades like this will be hard to leave behind. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Using the Aphid entry rules, it seems we have a limit buy a few moments ago at 247.76 + spread or thereabouts. Pretty close to the SL level too.

Are you sure the limit is not set at 247.06 or thereabouts? That's the closing price on the first repainting blue bar on my charts.

I think I am reading it correctly, I have StepChoppy v1 the repaint on the bottom. The horizontal line marks where I thought the limit buy would be. Let me know if I have missed something....cheers.

Fresian, you're not using an Alpari UK data feed, which is what all the prior testing and current testing done by Team Aphid is based on, and it makes a huge difference since we're using 4-hr bars, and time zones are different. So, if you want to be on the same page as everyone in the thread, you should probably get an Alpari version of MT4.

This is correct and you should be long as our limit buy order was hit on 12/7 08:00 bar. At that time, the green ATR line was at 247.68 which was too close as the low of the same bar was at 247.69. Therefore, you could put your SL below yellow ATR line to give room, but now we are well above green ATR line (247.86). If you don't want any risk and lock some profits, you can use green ATR line as your SL. If you love risk and give the trade more room, then you can keep your SL below yellow ATR line.

Doh, I forgot that I'm not even running a version of Alpari on my machine anyway! What I quoted in the last few posts was from IBFX, and I think they're on a different TZ than Alpari, so I was dead off either way :-)

So it looks like we have a change in cycle with a red bar but the close was more than 10pips below yellow ATR line so I guess now we hang back and wait for some BLUE to go long....

I've been reading through this thread and doing some preliminary backtesting using TeamAphid's modifications. My initial observations show this to be a potentially very profitable system across multiple pairs.  
  
As there's not been a lot posting on this thread in the last several weeks, I was just wondering if anyone else out there is still working on developing this system further.

Hi everybody!  
  
I'm back after a long absence. I've been busy with other projects, university and some new job opportunities during this time. I didn't even opened my FX plattform for the last months, so I'm trying to get up-to-date.  
  
I would love to know how this system perfomed during the last months, specially for TeamAphid and JoshDance rules (if anybody is using it, of course!) ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
  
Thank you!

Hi Pabloski!  
  
Welcome back and thanks for sharing your method. I have just been following on demo, not live trading but there has been some very nice trades the last couple of months as a result of the carry unwind and subsequent bounce back.  
  
I had a question for anyone following this system using the modified Aphid rules. The 29.08.2007 16:00 candle (Alpari Ru) signalled a long limit order entry as TrendPower was below 0.14. However by the close the following candle (20:00) TrendPower was greater than 0.14 which indicates to take the entry at this point. The one thing to note though was that by this time price was above the Aqua Line (+10 points) by ~45pips. So would this trade have now been disregarded or because it hadn't yet reached TP1 then still take the entry?  
  
While only demoing this method still, I took the trade and had the initial SL just below green line and also had it just below the low of the previous candle, ie the 16:00 candle. I was then fortunate enough to be sleeping when a couple of bars poked below the green line but did not hit my initial SL. So at the moment I still have all 4 lots on this trade open.  
  
So for those still following and using the modified rules, would be good to hear your take on this entry?  
  
Thanks..

Hi ! I only recently read this excellent thread and am still trying to get my head around the rules so please bear with me !   
  
As far as i can tell the last Short Entry was not valid as the first RED bar closed more than 10 pips below the Yellow ATR line.   
  
At what stage does a "new" potential short entry come into play ? Must there be a change in cycle again for this to happen ?   
  
In the current situation the bars have closed back above the yellow ATR again and then subsequently a red bar closed below the yellow ATR again. Would this be a valid Short Entry if that red bar were to close within 10 pips of the yellow ATR. I suspect not but just want to make sure i am understanding the rules correctly.  
  
Thanks !
