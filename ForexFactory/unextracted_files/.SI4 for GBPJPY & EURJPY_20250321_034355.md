I have some excellent .SI4 files for Fibonacci Trader SRV if anyone is interested.  
  
**UPDATED FILES POSTED AT[TRENDCHASERFX.COM](http://trendchaserfx.com)!**  
  
  
I've been working on these for quite some time and is now the only system I use and have been using for a while. Nice part is, as you FT SRV users may know, is that I don't have to watch the charts at all. I let the system run, which is 100% mechanical, and it signals my phone when a trade is called; I log in on my Blackberry and make the trade. I had thought about marketing these, but I really don't have the time or the need to make a profit on them.  
  
Even though it's mechanical 100%, it's a highly profitable system. It's a volatility based system and that's all it really requires. No news watching, no fundamental analysis...just do as your told. And obviously, don't over leverage yourself. It's a day trading method that works most efficiently on the 30-150-D FT SRV charts. I can practically guarantee that there is no more efficient system for trading the GBP/JPY than this one.

For anyone who's not famaliar with Fibonacci Trader, it's available for a 14-day demo at fibonaccitrader.com. Make sure you download the SRV version for forex. Don't register until I get the files to you so you have the most time to either demo or profit from its use.

[Forex.com](/brokers/forexcom "View FOREX.com Broker Profile") and GFT both have a platform that works with Blackberry devices. GFTs' is specifically built for BB, while Forex.coms' is a browser based app. GFT has a much nicer interface as forex.com is just boxey and ugly. I also prefer GFT as a broker due to the fact they offer more services, more platform choices, a pro platform for executive accounts, as well as over 5 sales branches. I have recieved phone calls from my account exec. every week since switching to GFT. I hadn't heard from my FXsol guy in months. I want to know that my money is safe....they give me that feeling.  
  
I'm going to type up a "READ ME" file for these .SI4's so there is no misunderstanding as to their use. I'll get these out to everyone that has requested as quickly as possible.

![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) I think I got everyone. If not, let me know. Please include your email.  
  
The TREND CHASER FX system posts a 56% success rate, which in the trading realm is an outstanding number. Especially when you consider that the wins can run for several hundreds of pips whereas loses are limited. Most traders are lucky to be 36% percent win/loss ratio even when experiencing great success.  
  
The one thing I hadn't thought of till now is that that 56% percent may be dependant on the timezone I'm in. These trades all close at EOD (End of Day). No carry overs. So, you MAY experience a slighlty lower or possibly higher percentage. Either way, this is still a great system. The best I've used personally. Hope you have as much success!!

When you recieve a signal, do as your told. DON'T ANALYSE, DON'T SECOND GUESS.  
  
Those are the only rules. Really doesn't get easier. The system is a day trading system so all trades expire at the close. For me, around 8PM EST.  
  
You must respond to the signals regardless of what time of day.   
  
You'll win....you'll lose. But you'll win much more often and more points than you ever lose.  
  
I usually back up the GBP/JPY positions with a 150 point stop loss, JUST TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE. But I prefer to stay in till the system stops out....or calls a FLAT. I normally put on the SL when I need to leave the PC for a time.

Ah, I think I have the files in the right place. Now just waiting for my demo to get approved before I try this new toy out. I trade 4hr charts primarily so I have alot of "downtime" to tinker ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Mudd... i have used GFT but am totally confused with their statements and it seems that i get eaten alive with interest? Have you been able to deciphire their statements? I agree that their reps are great.... I switched because i just couldn't figure their statments out.

Mudd: PM sent, thanks  
  
James: I think you had troubles because your base currency wasn't USD(guessing), the other problem is you have "unrealized profit/loss" which can take a couple of days to clear which makes it more confusing. I had the same troubles. I trade with them now, and i keep a record outside of GFT and then compare to their statements, and its ok.

Muddy, does this look set up right? I also added email alert for "system trades and price alarms" only.  
  
So is all there to it is do what signal tells you then close it out at 8 pm est regardless of profit/loss?

If you change the chart to OHLC bars, the system is set up to paint the bars and make it easier to distinguish between SHORT, LONG, and FLATs.

The system will generate the FLAT at the end of the day and notify you. This primarily depends on your time zone. The system performance increased about 12% by closing positions EOD rather than carrying over. So, regardless of state, they are going to close.  
  
I was thinking about the whole time zone thing last night and figured that if someone is experiencing radical differences in performance due to their particular time zone, the easiest method would be to change the trading times to match EST - USA. So say your in Dubai which is 8 hours ahead of EST -USA, you would need to set the trading times back 8 hours.  
  
For those of you not famailiar with 24 hour military time, it's based on twelve midnight at 24:00. Past midnight is 00:01, 00:02, etc. One o' clock in the morning would be 01:00, 02:00 for two and so on. Twelve noon is 12:00 with one o' clock in the afternoon as 13:00. 14:00 for 2:00 and so on. 14:00 Sunday minus 8 hours for Dubai would need to be set as 08:00.  
  
This may overcome performance differences due to time zone.

I left that out of the READ ME file, but it does need to be set to "System trades and price alarms"  
  
You can also set it to "Short messages for text"

Couple more questions, if you would be so kind Muddbuddha.   
  
I have it all set up (only on gbp/jpy 30-150-D chart) and at 10:30 AM est I get texted "sell 1 short at 234.2200 Now SHORT 1" So I place a short at 234.22 and just hang out  
  
at 12:30 est I get text'd "Buy 1 at 233.76 Now FLAT" What does that mean? Is it referring to an old buy signal just telling me whats going on? or is that a new signal to buy now and get out of my short?  
  
4:06 EST I get text'd "Buy 1 at 233.48 Now FLAT"   
  
I am assuming that "Buy 1" is an old signal that was started before I got the platform up and I am getting texts on the status of it and that the signal to short 1 meant go Short. So I hypothetically would have 2 open orders one short and one long? And I would hold them both until 7pm EST before closing them regardless of profit/loss?  
  
I am sorry if these are remedial questions but I am trying to understand this system and I am sure some of these other fine folks might be wondering the same thing.

Also, MuddBuddha, if you could take a look at the screen shot and verify the time matches yours I think this would help a great many people as to how to match your results. Also, what data feed are you using? I think this may effect results too. Thanks!!

Actually, that Trailing Volatility setting is wrong. It should be 0.005.   
  
Is that straight from the imported system?

Times are right on the money...unless you live outside the EST timezone. The datafeed is straight from [FXCM](/brokers/fxcm "View FXCM Broker Profile") for FT SRV by default.

**Correct. Open a SHORT with 1 LOT**  
  
_at 12:30 est I get text'd "Buy 1 at 233.76 Now FLAT" What does that mean? Is it referring to an old buy signal just telling me whats going on? or is that a new signal to buy now and get out of my short?_  
  
**FLAT means that for whatever reason the system has declared the trade invalid. If it's prior to EOD, then the primary reason would be a retrace and close back above the trailing volatility line....or a progressive climb in the other direction. One of those two reasons. At this point, you would close your position.**  
  
4:06 EST I get text'd "Buy 1 at 233.48 Now FLAT"   
  
I am assuming that "Buy 1" is an old signal that was started before I got the platform up and I am getting texts on the status of it and that the signal to short 1 meant go Short. So I hypothetically would have 2 open orders one short and one long? And I would hold them both until 7pm EST before closing them regardless of profit/loss?  
  
**No. It called that one as the EOD, "you better be out by now" call. BUY 1 at 233.48 Not FLAT means that the trade is longer valid so buy one lot to close out the SHORT position. Sometimes it may seem like a repeat. It's just a little quirk it has. You would only get a old signal if the opening was VERY close to when you fired up the platform.**  
  
**Fibonacci Trader was originally built for stocks and options and was ported over to forex. So it doesn't have the ability to hedge a position of the same symbol.**

For those just starting to set up charts, if you open the charts screen and select new chart, the pair symbol, and then place 30 in the first time box and hit TAB, FT will auto in the rest of the boxes.  
  
There is a chance that FT automatically adjusts for timezone difference....not quite sure since I've only used it in EST - USA.

I would normally never discuss pip gains as I typically couldn't care less about how many I close out, but to serve as an example to how effective this extremely easy system is (unless it wakes you up at 2:30 AM ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1) ), I went ahead and did the math and found I closed out 558 pips this week. That was after a 86 point stop out earlier this week.  
  
Now, to stiffle any comments as to, "What about non volatile weeks?", well you still have a better than 50% chance of a weekly gain, so this is how I approach that. I check the FF calendar a few times a week. I really don't care whether the news comes in bad or good and rarely even watch the charts around news time. What I am looking for is the chance of a volatile week. A highly voaltile whipsaw week just feeds this beast with lots and lots of $$. A not so volatile week still feeds th beast but to a lesser degree....so....up your lots. This way you compensate for the lack of volatility. On volatile weeks, lower your lots to the normal level.  
  
If I close 200 a week, I'm fine. I'm not in a race or competition with anyone. My goal is financial freedom...not bragging rights. **558 was a decent week for trading one pair on the 30 minute chart and never actually seeing the chart.**

Others may want to check as well...it shouldn't have been .004. I apologize for that. Not sure if it was something I did or ???

Okay, if I got this right..like you said earlier just enter when it tells you and we exit one of 3 ways?  
1.) get a "FLAT" signal then exit  
2.) get an opposite signal then exit current position and open new position in opposite direction  
3.) exit at 7PM EST if #1 and #2 didn't happen regardless of P&L.  
  
Maybe I misunderstand your post and #2 shouldn't ever happe. Please let me know if those rules are wrong, I'm just trying to get the semantics right. I don't mean to come across as a knucklehead.

Right....except for the 7pm part. I stay in UNTIL it tells me to exit. It will FLAT at EOD unless there is a reason to prior.  
  
If you get a SHORT 1, and an hour or so later you recieve, NOW LONG 2, it's basically performing a STOP AND REVERSE where you buy 2 lots in the opposing direction to close out the ones short and enter one long. It will never have to positions at one time. But don't jump the gun on the EOD exit; let the system go. You never know what might happen. I jumped the gun about two weeks ago thinking I had milked it clean and in the last 30 minutes it drop another 150+. The system knows what it's doing.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

I apologize, but I know nothing about MT4 scripting at all, so I can't be much help there...possibly skyline. I've been slow to get the second batch of emails out as I've been working late this week on an emergency project for the State, so posting the files here probably would be the best method.  
  
I'm suprised by the overwhemling response to the first post. Didn't quite expect this many requests. If you're expecting a highly complex system of technical formulation....this aint it. This is a trailing volatility system that thrives on the GBP/JPY; and the GBP/JPY has a long history of high volatility. If you think it's hard to trade now, you should have seen it back around 1998 when it plummented over 3000 pips like a hot iron through butter. It seems to climb, climb, climb...reach a breaking point and then fall into a lower orbit only to start its ascent again. I'm not really that interested as to why, just that it does. I don't have to know how the mountain was formed to admire its' majesty. That is the GBP/JPY in a nutshell.

Yes there's no problem MuddBuddha, I can code it in mt4 and this could be a good pleasure for a lot of users that use it here. But I have to know the rules, otherwise I cannot , could you summarize them here ? Do you use some particular indicator ?

Well that will take me a bit of digging. It's similar to the trailing stop, chandler stop, and volatility stop indicators you can find on Tradestation and MT...._but not quite the same. Also, FT SRV is fairly unique in it's three time frame approach to charting._ Not saying it can't be done, cause I really don't know. Just not sure how easy it would be personally.  
  
I'm not going to beat around the bush about it's value. Typically one decent trade will pay for FT SRV for a month or two. A GOOD trade will pay for FT SRV for a year! A couple of good trades and you have yourself a charting package as well as a Blackberry! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1) I have no issues with spending money to make money. Which is why I have stuck with FT and this particular system. I also have a T-Mobile line specifically dedicated to the Blackberry which I use only for trading. I believe in it _THAT MUCH_. Not saying it's easy....I hate getting woken up at 3AM from a deep sleep to open and close a trade; but at the same time it gives me a sense of excitement knowing that I may wake up to find the GBP/JPY has taken off on another 200-500 pip run. I'm not selling FT, just that I believe in its value as far as trading. I've read all the threads about the GBP/JPY which seem to be growing all the time. It's an exciting and frustrating pair to trade soley on personal discretion and analysis. I've had such good success with it on this system that I thought I would share this little secret system. I know how frustrating it can be to trade, trade, trade, and never seem to get anywhere.  
  
Also, I didn't invent this system. It's not even really a system at all. It's just an indicator that I kept playing with over and over trying different ideas until I was able to get it around 55% successful. Out of the last 51 trades, its won 30 and lost 21. Giving it a current rating of 58.82%. It's won up to 4 times in a row and lost twice in a row. It averages about 130-150 pips per win with the recent top at 430 pips and the largest loss at 138. You typically get 2-4 signals per week, maybe less if the movement is strong. You won't catch all the points possible, but with those previous posted results.....who cares?! It works well with the GBP/JPY and decently with EUR/JPY. It's terrible on the EUR/USD and better than terrible on the GBP/USD. So I stick to the top dog and live off that. No point giving hard earned $$ back to a pair that doesn't deliver as much as the GBP/JPY>

Mudd,  
Your chart is awsome! The volatility stop is too accurate. Here is an image of the NRTR for MT4. It's not as accurate as what you show but perhaps it will assist in creating the MT4 version.  
Do any of your indicators repaint? The accuracy of your chart is going to make me lose sleep.

Well, I'm not quote sure what you mean by repaint, but if I've guessed correctly you mean kinda, "After the fact".  
  
This system triggers at the bars close. That's part of what makes it so successful. A lot of times the price will come to the volatility line, sometimes cross but not close and then move on to profit. An instant trigger would have closed out and missed the profit as price was penetrating and rebounding due to stops or anything else that may make price action bouncy. The painting of the bars is not really part of the process, just eye candy to help show position, i.e. LONG, SHORT, FLAT, at a quick glance.   
  
If that doesn't answer you question let me know....but walk me through more of what you mean.

Do you know if there's any chance in FT platform to get the formula from indicator? I downloaded FT just to check by myself but my account isn't yet activated , so I cannot verify directly. If I get the indicator formula I can try to code something for mt4 otherwise it will be impossible to do any conversion.

No, the GBP/JPY and EUR/JPY listed were seperate, previous versions of the Trend Chaser SI4. You want to use it on the 30-150-D. I just included the others in the zip file in case someone wanted to play around with them. I'm going to post this on FF thread as it may come up again.

FT SRV is all graphically based which makes it quite different than others where as there is no direct coding. You select values and trade types from drop down menus. I can see only the period type and CONST value. There are some scaling values and what not, but nothing that would give away the true equation. I'll see what I can find on Google.   
  
BTW, don't confuse it with the volatility stop. That's actually a seperate indicator in FT.

Here are a couple of screenshots.  
  
The first is the setting that should be present for the volatility indicator; if it isn't, please change it promptly.  
  
The second is the profit/loss chart for the last 51 trades.

I've been using FT for awhile. And I still can't figure out how you're getting FT to close EOD at 5PM EST. I've tried changing exchange time, trading times, you name it -- It still closes EOD at the 23:30 bar...  
  
The only way to prevent this in FT is to set your trading times to a non-24 hour market.  
  
So I'm interested in how you're doing it... I might just go ahead and email Carlos..

I stuck it and a screenshot on the first post of the thread.  
  
Make sure the system setting is .005 after you have applied it to the 30-150-D chart. You'll find it by right clicking the system name in the upper left corner and select EDIT. Double click the trailing volatility indicator and check the setting for .005. Default is .004, but during volatile movement it trails too closely and will get stopped out too quickly.

These actually close for me at 19:30 EST, Monday thru Thursday - 5:00 on Fridays. If you use the exchange times under the symbol set up, it doesn't quite work the same. Use the EOD option in the systems OPTION screen.

Mudd,  
  
Have you backtested this "system"?  
  
It's possible that you could simply be experiencing a very good run right now; one that simply cannot sustain itself in the future (or has not in the past for that matter).  
  
But knowing you, I'm sure you've dotted your i's and crossed your t's.  
  
Thanks

Well, the only requirement of the system is volatility. Every pair climbs and falls. That's the nature of the market. Especially in the current trend of feeding on low volatility to maximize vesting potential.   
The system doesn't do anything special other than trail that volatility for however long it can prior to the reversal. How that can be a short lived effect....I'm not really sure.  
I personally don't believe that every system fails. _I do, however, believe that every trader fails._ Seeing the state of the market and trading accordingly is part of the game. If a system that needs high volatility is failing in low volatility over a prolonged period, then it needs adjusted, not abandoned. In the case of this system, you would need to only adjust the indicator parameter down to somewhere from .002 to .004.  
  
I think you'll find the market will increase in volatility as more and more traders learn that markets are easily swayed in low volume.  
  
No, I haven't acktested it for any prolonged period.

And that's just it, Mudd. It's the good ole' problem that's inherent in every system -- you never know you're in a range until it's too late. Heck, if we could all find the magic choppy indicator, we'd all be rich... (well maybe not... some traders would still lose... but you get my point I'm sure...) ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) I did. It still closes at 23:30...This would be easy on my futures markets... not so on Forex since it's 24 hours and there's no "EOD"... That's why it closes at 23:30. Why yours closes at 19:30 is beyond me. My exchange times are -7 on FOREX, and I'm -3 from EST.  
  
I also get worse results than you. Very good, but my percentage is lower. Around 46-48%... which is still very good for this system (this is much like the TeamAphid BAT system)...

Ok, I know what the problem is... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
It closes at 23:30 EXCHANGE time, which is:  
  
23:30 - 7 = 16:30 my time... OR  
  
19:30 EST... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

As you can see, if you started using this in 2005, you'd drop it after the first drawdown... well most people would. And I would put money on the fact that it doesn't backtest well before that...  
  
Of course, you can see where 2007 starts...

Here's the NO CLOSE EOD version -- which I prefer when trading stop and reverse systems...  
  
Notice that in early 2005, you actually go negative. That's scary. But overall, it's very good.  
  
I plan to look at this with some stop losses and whatnot to see if we can minimize the drawdowns... but other than that, I like this better.  
  
Once again, S&R systems with no close EOD is all dependent on your risk tolerance.

What if we add a stop based on the last 55 periods of hi/lo? (Note: FT's Trailing checkmark is broken. In order for it to trail, the hi/lo Trailing setting must be **unchecked)**  
  
The results are pretty much the same -- DD is a tad larger, but overall, you end up with about 20K more...and a slightly better curve.

Looking at the charts it looks like if you used a true stop and reverse in this pair you would have 2614 pips august 8-31st, and if you used EOD it was 2065 pips. But I'll try Muddbuddha's set up. You cant argue with results like his.

I'm going to help out those that may not know or have the ability to set up the SMTP portion of the FT platform.....  
  
Under the EMAIL ALERTS in the GLOBAL SETTINGS (UTILITIES), use the SMTP information from the screenshot except substitute your cell info (SMS text or cell email address).  
  
Here are the email addresses for the 6 most popular cellular phone carriers:   

  1. **T-Mobile:** _phonenumber_ @**tmomail.net**  
**Virgin Mobile:** _phonenumber_ @**vmobl.com**  
**Cingular/ATT:** _phonenumber_ @**cingularme.com or @txt.att.net**  
**Sprint:** _phonenumber_ @**messaging.sprintpcs.com**   
**Verizon:**_phonenumber_ @**vtext.com**   
**Nextel:**_phonenumber_ @**messaging.nextel.com**  
  
where _phonenumber_ = **your 10 digit phone number**

If you don't know the phone carrier for the cell phone number you are attempting to call, [you can try this universal service.](http://www.tech-recipes.com/instant_messaging_tips362.html)  
  
You need to enter the email as the username authentication ([SIGNAL@trendchaserfx.com](mailto:SIGNAL@trendchaserfx.com)) and the password.   
  
I don't want to post the password in a public forum as it would risk it being used for spam. **If you're a 1KT trader, I will send you the password.**  
  
**I will also need to limit it to less than 25-50 users to make sure the signals make it through in a timely manner.**  
  
All others will need to be vouched for by someone trustworthy. If you can figure out the SMTP by Googling your mail carriers SMTP settings, just place it in the appropriate field.

Have you manually gone back to analysis the trades? This would help determine why the back test would see such a drop. Trailing is trailing. The pair would have to make abrupt jig jags about every 250 pips in order to have that poor of performance. Using the .005 setting should limit losses to no more than 150 points. I checked the 2004-2005 charts and the pair was still trading within a 1000 point range which should be more than sufficient to trade successfully. It's actually been in that same pip range with the recent trades.  
  
If you get stopped out more than 2-3 times in a row or your P/L is in a steady decline, utilizing any system be it automatic or manually traded....it's time to go over things.   
  
My experience is that forex traders jump from system to system too quickly without putting any blood, sweat, and tears into it first. We often look for the perfect system that will weather any storm.   
  
When I lived in Wyoming I would change my summer treads on my car to winter treads without fail every October to prepare for the Winter...._maybe life lessons can be learned in the simplest things._  
  
Take a look at the charts manually and let me know what you think. My FT platform kicks me back to 700 bars everytime I place it at more than 29,000. So I can't help you much there.

_"I plan to look at this with some stop losses and whatnot to see if we can minimize the drawdowns"_  
  
I normally place a 150 pip stop loss from opening if I'm not near the PC. If it's getting later in the day or I'm in meetings all day, I'll place a 200 pip trailer on it as well. That seems to work just as well. Though to be honest, it hasn't hit my stop prior to being called FLAT or reversed anyway.

Muddbuddha, it seems you have been through this system with a fine tooth comb. I wonder what your thoughts are about not closing EOD and just rolling as a true stop and reverse so you are always in the market?  
  
It appears to work fantastic if you are always in, but I don't have alot of bars to go back and look, only since August 8th or so on my charts.

Funny you mention....I have been playing with one on the GBP/USD that was near 89% by being in all the time. As far as this particular system, mine gained 12% by closing EOD than rolling over and getting hit with the strong move reversal that is common on the GBP/JPY. I knew that others may see differing P/L values depedning on barws in history, time zone, settings, etc....just wasn't sure to what extent.  
  
To increase the bars in memory, click the options icon (chart bars) and set the bars in memory to 29000. This should bring it out quite a ways. You may want to try 30K or more...mine resets to 700 if I do but you may have better luck. You can also change it in the global settings which will make it default for any new charts you open.  
  
I'll dig up that GBP/USD system. Some of you recieved the first Trend Chaser FX system in the .zip file....that one is a fairly safe system. Not as profittable, but safe in that it only takes trades in the direction of the major trend and is based on a longer time frame. It would sometimes hold for a couple of days. I used that one for quite some time prior to stripping it down to just the Trailing Volatility indicator. FT SRV makes it so easy to design and play around with systems since it's all graphically based that I often shot around ideas on Sundays prior to the open just to see what I can come up with.

Had a decent conversation via PM...thought I'd share.  
  
_**"Also, could you comment on the ~ weekly pip gain from your system?"**_  
  
Well, I'll help as much as possible. I typically _EXPECT_ 200 points per week, but there have been weeks where the P/L gain has exceeded 800. This week was around 580 even with a stop out. Gains come in time. The key is to be patient and not get anxious about the losses. Put realistic goals on yourself and your system. Try new things and ideas....break out of the forex dogmas that often exist concerning MA systems, Naked Trading, price action,funamentals, etc. All things have benefit to an open mind and all things hinder to a closed mind.  
  
I started enjoying the most success when I stopped reading what others thought and did and traded sound, tried and true ideas. I avoided FF for a period so I wouldn't be tempted to read the most recent posts of this weeks guru. That's when I realized that the only thing making trading hard was me and me alone.  
  
When you do succeed, be proud of your accomplishments, but make it a quiet pride. Boastfulness only breeds selfishness which in turn breeds greed and vanity. Be more like Rocky and less like Mr. T. (corny 80's reference)  
  
Approach trading as a business, not a competition. Use a profit margin for your weekly or monthly goals. If you're not meeting those goals, evaluate yourself AND your system. Indentify where you are suffering albeit your system or your own temptations.

postcast is the smtp server I use to email out stuff from MT4, works good and is free. pretty easy to configure FT to use it once Mudd told us where to find those settings. let me know if anyone has questions.

Hi Mudd,   
  
I have attached my time zone screen, my timezone says -4  
I'm just wondering if you can confirm that is what yours is as well,  
I have set my computer clock to est (usa) to make sure I get the same  
settings as you without any complications.  
  
Thanks for the great system.

Carlos and the gang over at FT will be very surprised come Tuesday, since they run such a software package that has a very small, dedicated following... Seeing about 200 people request demo's should be interesting to them... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Oh lordy, that fixed it, thanks for being a hero MuddBuddha. It was so obvious I missed it. I'll go find my dunce cap. I'll go delete the other posts I made. Clutters up this thread ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

market just did a nice jump right as the 30 min bar closed, gave a buy signal then few seconcds later gave a close flat signal, wild stuff.  
  
Did you also get this mudd, I just wanna make sure my settings are all behaving correctly.  
  
Just noticed I don't see the sell flat arrow there, only the buy, but an alert popped up seconds after it gave the buy signal, saying  
to close, then after that i got another buy signal, so it turns out I got 3 signals in about 1 min, all got sent to my email, go long, then flat  
then go long again, hopefully nothign wrong with my settings, just a freak price move so it freaked out maybe.  
  
thanks

So i got a buy, a short to close, and then another buy at 2:00 am ESt, then a short to close at 2:30 am est, I got a feeling one of my settings is wrong, or does this sound right?  
Oh and with the latest short to close signal there is no arrow there, but i received a email and saw the message popup in FT.

Sorry for all these posts mudd, I just wanna make sure I got it right, i have attached the indicator edit page for the trailling volatility settings,  
should the calculate only at bars close be checked? Or is it normal for the system to tell you to close out before bar close? If that's normal  
then that would explain whats been happening, just I was under the impression this is a bar close system, it keeps signalling to close/flat even tho the bar hasn't closed, i think since the long signal at 2:ooam est its signalled for me to sell/close about 10 times, is it normal to repeat itself tellin you to close?  
  
From what I just read, on page 4, you said its a bar close system, so I'm sure I got something wrong going on, cause visuallly, it looks like I should still be long, as there is the green arrow from 2:00am to go long, and a bunch of bars have closed after that, and there is still no white arrow printed on the chart.  
  
Thanks  
Westie

I got the call to go LONG same time as you did....I didn't get a FLAT though. The TV line should be down near 233.19, so it shouldn't have triggered a FLAT.

post up a chart screen too, please. And double check the settings under the STOP and PROFIT screens against the previous posted screens I put up.

Anyone interested in trying, I got a 5% performance gain by editing the STOP options to CLOSE AT EOD and REOPEN NEXT DAY. Check both and I gained 5%.  
  
You can track the performance of the system by right clicking the system name on the chart and select RESULTS. Then choose SUMMARY>PERFORMANCE>RESULTS.  
  
If anyone else experiences that, let me know.

Okay, I know you guys are going to want to smack me.....but.....  
  
I was playing around with some settings since Mr. Trend had been talking about the 2004-2005 performance and came across this.  
  
If you add the same indicator to the system a 2nd time, but change the setting to .009 and then click USE AS TREND INDICATOR & ALL TREND INDICATORS MUST BE IN THE SAME DIRECTION.  
  
Uncheck OPEN NEXT day in the STOP options screen; keep CLOSE AT EOD; close the system screen. You should see a nice increase in performance.  
  
Check out the screens below. Try if you like, or stick with the original....it's a holiday so I had time to play around.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Mine drops almost 7% performance if I uncheck close at EOD. Does yours go up? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f615.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/2753.png?v=15.1) It LOOKS great, but the actual profit gain is lower than closing out at EOD.

I reloaded my chart and your system, and it seems to be not shooting off  
flat signals now, so hopefully it's fixed now.  
  
Does it ever tell you to close midway thru a bar, or is it a true bar close system where it has to close on the other side of the line before signalling  
the flat?  
  
Thanks   
Westie

_  
No, it will signal at the bars close for a FLAT; and unless it's also EOD, it should signal a reversal if the price crosses back through the T.V. line.

Hey Mr. Trend....check out this P/L chart, see what you think. It suffered no drawdown since 01/03/06. Only 46% Vs. 58%, but there are no extended periods of drawdown.  
  
Of course if you compound your lots as equity grows, then this chart would only be representative of the original balance and not the compounded balance.

I tried to duplicate that chart Mudd, but I guess its not 0.009 trailing volatility.  
  
Is there a decent indicator to use on the higher time frame to filter the 30 minute time frame. Like only take trades in the trend direction of the 150 minute or even daily? I am looking through these indies and some say next and high so I assume those are the ones to look at.  
  
I tried to save a P&L chart but I can't find where it is saved. Anyone know what file the charts are saved by default?

Here....try this and see what you think. The HIGH/LOW activator is a good choice for trend filtering. Use the HIGH.

Yeah...it probably doesn't make sense to people who use retail brokers, but here's a thought...with a GBP/JPY average of 2-3 pips at Interactive Brokers + commission, you'll probably cut that spread in half...recalculate and get back to us.

I don't mind paying for service. Everybody deserves to make a buck and the bigger the company, the more bucks required to be made.   
  
Companies that advertise fractional pips or the lowest spread??? How do they pull it off? You get what you pay for a lot of times.  
  
But I get what your saying, lep.

IBFX is worse than that. GBP/JPY ranges from 9 to 20 pip spread. The average looks to be around 11 or 12.  
I'll probably move my account because of that.

Dang.  
  
I don't mind paying a FAIR price, but that's a bit excessive.  
  
When it comes to brokers you need to avoid the dollar store brokers and the Saks fifth avenue variety. Find yourself a nice Wal Mart broker and stick with em'.

I was a victim of Refco. Another thing I'm concerned with is the broker folding up and taking my money.

And that is always a risk even with regulation. The fact is once a broker enters into bankruptcy hearings, your money is stuck. Every trader should take the ability of their broker to be there in 5-10 years very seriously.  
  
When you reach 200K will they allow you to pull 65K from your account all at once? Regardless of whether if it is yours or not, you'd be surprised at the excuses a lot of brokers will come up with to persuade you not to. It could be for a kidney transplant...they couldn't care less.  
  
Check their operation. How many offices...how many staff. Are they still developing their platform(s) or letting them age? Are they keeping up with technology and demand? These questions won't guarantee that they won't fold, but they can give you clues to a company that is loosing money. Does your broker shut down for several hours on U.S minor (bank) holidays (excludes christmas, easter, thanksgiving, etc.) ? Even though the U.S. is on holiday doesn't mean the whole world is. I got stopped out on a profitable position about a year ago because my broker was closed from 11-7 for the holiday observance while the rest of the world continued to trade. I couldn't close when it came time around 2PM and had to watch it go negative and stop out when they came back online at 7PM. Servers run regardless of there being anyone in the office or not. These are the kind of things to watch for and avoid as you mature in trading.

sounds like FX Solutions to me....they seem to be the only one I know that shuts 'em down...so to speak...I left them along time ago especially when they told me the spread on the G/U was going to 5!!! and their reasoning was that there was'nt much volitility on the pair???? ie. slow mover WOW!  
  
Good luck with finding reputable brokers...they are few and far between...but with new Regs around the corner, maybe we'll see some mergers and folders.

Anyone know where FT SRV saves the results p&l graphs? I am looking through the file and cannot find them. I found some interesting results just tinkering and would like to show some of them. I'll just post a screenie in the meanwhile. This is from 3/31/06 to present. Its 1/4 of the trades of Mudd's and about same profit.   
  
The more I look through this software package the more I like it. The multi time frames built in lend to some interesting ideas

I use IB. Comms and spread equal to around 4-5 on GBPJPY... not bad at all. They are interbank [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") and sometimes I can get 1 pip on GBPJPY... albeit for a second or two.  
  
They're entire setup and the way they operate (tight margin requirements and risk adverse ideals) is why they are the professional's choice. And why when you talk to successful traders, they trade with IB or people like MB who are known for their futures platform for YEARS.  
  
I don't understand why people go with hinky dinky brokers. It must be the infomercial thing or somethin'...go with the big guys who have been around awhile like IB, MB Trading, etc. The only retail FX broker I would even consider is [Oanda](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile").

Muddbuddha:  
  
It has been quite a while since I have spent any amount of time on the systems posted here. I have given yours a thorough look and backtest with Fib Trader and have posted some excellent results. I wanted to share my data with you in regards to closing out at EOD vice not closing out.  
  
I set the # of bars on the chart to 29000 (seems it won't go higher than 30000)...  
  
Date: 03/07/2005 to 03/09/2007  
  
218 Trades  
  
Results with closing at EOD: 2710 pips  
Results NOT closing at EOD: 6308 pips  
  
Clearly this is a strong argument for not closing out at EOD. Both scenarios put on 218 trades; with a 9 pip spread for GJ this = 1962 pips lost due to spread (ouch!)  
  
Thank you wholeheartedly for sharing such a simple system. I will be forward testing it shortly and will share my results here!  
  
Best in trading,  
  
D.

Or it feeds a trader's emotional flaw of always having to be in a trade... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
You have to figure out who you are in this game and always be honest with yourself. If you're a daytrader, be a daytrader. If you're a swing trader, be a swing trader. If you work on a system that has great P/L, but it's in and out of trades all day like a kamikaze, and you know that you'd be biting your nails all day, then perhaps that's not the right system for you. What **will** happen is that you won't follow the system and you'll lose, no matter how profitable it is...

If you haven't got a handle on your emotions, then GBP/JPY should be the **LAST** pair people should be trading!  
  
Taking this strategy back to when the pound and yen were more correlated, the wild moves would be taken off the table and closing EOD would be a hinderence, especially if you've got 7-8 pips spread(me).

Just an update to my previous post:  
  
Even with closing out at EOD off, you will still be out of the market occasionally.  
  
I had an issue with the exit signals - they seemed to pop up even in the middle of some pretty strong trends. I played with it and found the following:  
  
If you turn Heiken Ashi ON, it gives you much better exits, to the tune of 9,277 pips for the same time period as I posted above.  
The largest losing trade in this scenario was only 158 pips!

Been there, done that. Look at the opening of the heiken-ashi bar and then look at the actual open of the bar. Big difference. That's because HA bars are an average of the open. So your results would be totally flawed. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

I was creating a system one time, and I had HA bars up and a couple other ideas on the system, and I thought I was gonna be a millionaire in about a year. As I was going through my system while forward testing, I realized there was a big flaw somewhere... the flaw was entering off of the open of the HA bar... not even close to reality. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) I was so disappointed.

You get 2 out of 20 ideas to work? I'll take those odds anyday!!  
  
Anyway, check this one out.. Not a whole lot different from Mudds just different time frame. I need something that trades less often because I am paying through the nose in spreads. Thing about this one is from the last 18 mos there is a streak of 11 loses and a drawdown of 939 pips. You have to keep the faith when trading this, oh and its an always in system, no close eod.

So the question is, can you handle a 939 pip drawdown? I know very few that can -- well, at least the ones who are honest anyway. And I know at least three traders, IRL, who are pro, and they can't handle that. It takes a real trend trader to be able to handle those swings. And you can see it happens A LOT with that system.

Well, I could sweat it out if I had a successful track history using the system. But if out of the gate I had a 1k draw down, I'd be crapping kittens.  
  
Is there a way to get more bars to backtest past 2006 in the FT platform? I got it to go back to 1993 on daily bars, but I need 4hr bars.

You shouldn't even think about trading a system unless you've got a good historical backtest (I personally do AT LEAST 200-300 trades) and, with automated systems, a good (IMO) three months of live forward testing.

The best you can do is set it at 29000 bars. You're then limited by the historical capabilities of the data provider (which in this case, is [FXCM](/brokers/fxcm "View FXCM Broker Profile")).

Here is another one that is fun to look at. over 7k pips in 18 months and only 51 trades. It uses the dbl stoc ema indicator as a filter. I tried to look this indicator up to see if it repaints and I didnt find anything that said it did. Again this would be sweet if you can heartily sit through 1,000 pip drawdowns.

Okay, here is a slightly tweaked version, over 73% winning trades over 18 months and nearly 8k in net pips. Smoother equity curve and the drawdown is very tolerable and only 1 losing trade in a row. It was 49 trades in 18 months so that is only 2.5 trades per month or so. Lazy pip earner. This platform is fun to play with ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

That is the basis of being a self earning trading is the ability to recognize areas of possible improvement, try, test, and try again until you come up with a system that _YOU_ are satisfied with.   
  
FT will give you the tools to do just that without learning a scripting language and allows you to try several ideas within a short period of time.   
  
Don't hesistate to try variations of other peoples ideas. Check your backtest for sustainable profits with minimal drawdown. Save your systems and make reference notes if necessary.

I am really digging this platform, even though I know very little about it. Is there a FT SRV forum or some other idea exchanging place for this platform? It is very powerful stuff, you can literally create systems in a couple minutes and check how they do. When I get home from work I'll try to get something put together for the cable.

I would have assumed that the fib trader program would have used the actual price, not the averaged (heiken ashi) in the backtest - I will have to take a look at this as if it doesn't that is a major flaw in the program. With HA it's not normally the price you are interested in, just the change of colour to signify end or start of a trend - as long as the backtest positions exit with the REAL price then it should be accurate.  
  
I hope this thing isn't as buggy as MT4 with it's EA backtesting .. that thing's a piece of shite.

No, it's not a flaw. It's actually the **correct** way of showing Heiken-Ashi. You're just used to MT, which requires an indicator just to show those bars, which is a bastardized way of doing things.  
  
If you go look up the definition of Heiken-Ashi, you'll see that any program that **does** show it like FT does, is actually correct.  
  
MT is a good program for the cost (free) and for those who are starting out in trading, but to be quite honest, it's a piece of crap. Check out Neoticker, eSignal, Tradestation, Ensign, and FT. Those are the guns that have been around awhile and have stood the test of time. (Neo is a little new, but it rocks.)

Here's how I get email and cell alerts for anyone that doesnt know how.  
  
First I signed up a email account with bluebottle  
then fill the fields as such,  
  
SMTP Server: mail.bluebottle.com  
Sender name: mudd signals  
Sender Email: [Whatever@bluebottle.com](mailto:Whatever@bluebottle.com)  
Recipient Name: Whatever  
Recipient Email: [Whatever@bluebottle.com](mailto:Whatever@bluebottle.com)  
cc: [10digitphonenumber@mobile.celloneusa.com](mailto:10digitphonenumber@mobile.celloneusa.com)   
  
Turn use authentication on:   
username:whatever@bluebottle.com  
password: whatever your bluebottle password is.   
  
  
This way you get a email and a cell alert, you can obviously  
have no email and just cell alert by putting the cell number in the   
recipient email field.  
  
hope that helps anyone that can't figure it out.

Yes I do understand how Heiken Ashi works - as I said before, however, I would assume that any program that backtests a given system would use the real price for entries & exits; just like we do when trading.  
  
D.  
  
Edit: I took a good luck and it looks like it does trade on the HA averages, not the actual price. Thanks a bunch for pointing this out Mr. Trend!

Very nice! 2.17 profit factor is excellent! Very few draw downs. If you feel up to it, post a .zip of it here or email me a copy....if you don't mind.

That equity curve goes negative homey, still not shabby though. Did you see my post that has a profit factor of 4.04 and 8k pips in 18 months (post #117)? Hit me with a PM with your email if you want to look at it. Regardless, most these posting have seen drawdowns in the multiple hundreds at times, and you have to have nerves of steel to stick to your plan if you ever take one of these live, and of course make sure you don't leverage yourself into a margin call if you catch a bad stretch.  
  
I like longer TFs because I trade less often and pay less spread. Also lets me get away from staring at charts.

Yeah, it's practically impossible to develop one that doesn't show some type of drawdown from initial use. What I look for the most are the severity of drawdowns and a nice increasing trendline of equity. A jagged mountain range it tough to deal with. When you're on the wrong side of the mountain you feel as though your system is failing you, though you may be out of it within a day or two. A nice ascending slope is easier on the nerves overall.  
  
I saw your system, lep....what profit rating did your platform generate? Also, what JPY cross are you using?

Exactly. I think these guys are doing a very good job so far. I'm anxious to see their work as well.  
  
With GBPJPY, you're gonna have drawdowns. And with the kind of systems that are being looked at in this thread, 400-800 pip drawdowns are very common.  
  
You can't really kill too much DD without hurting the profitability of the system -- at least in terms of these kinds of systems.

Check out this Profit Factor![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f973.png?v=15.1)9 trades in 18 months, talk about some swap ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1) 2 losing trades in 18 months for only 289 pips. Don't get too eager though, the floating P&L roller-coaster on this bad boy would make baby jesus cry.

Here is what I have come up with - it basically uses MACD (12,26,6) as another trend indicator. I have been playing with all sorts of settings for it (hence it taking so long getting it up here) - if you manage to get it working better, let us know!!!

Heres the system from Post 117, Its only 49 trades in the last 18 months so it will be nigh impossible to forward test on a 2 week demo FT account. Profit Factor is great at 4.04 and max drawdown of 656 consecutive pips. 73% winning trades though ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Heres the above system w/ Damien's macd idea put in also. It has slightly less pips but much better drawdown at 393 consecutive pips. Smoother P&L curve.

Here is another one, nearly 9k pips in the last 18 months, that is nearly 70 pips per trading day. Remember, the floating P&L on these can get nutty, so I would only risk 1 mini per $2000 unless you don't like sleeping at night.

I forgot to mention to everyone creating systems. Never create a system that executed "at bar close." Because that's not real world. You always want to execute at "next bar's open", because you can get some slightly off results. It's not substantial, but when you start talking about slippage and whatnot, it can be.  
  
Unfortunately, FT doesn't do a good job of allowing you to add slippage. Tradestation, on the other hand, does do a good job as I recall...  
  
Regardless, hope that helps.

Well, the time frame is subjective to the method and doesn't necessarily garauntee that you have to take fewer trades. Also consider that FT has the ability to "see" three time frames at once. That being said, the Trend Chaser built on the 30-150-D typically only takes a trade once a day. If you want to hold position longer, then gradually increasing the TF can be effective. However, on volatile pairs with systems where you rely on the system to call the trade flat Vs. a set stop line, you could go extremely negative on longer time frames when events occur, like the subprime scare, that cause the market to dump suddenly. **Not saying you shouldn't use longer timeframes, just don't box yourself into a set time frame because that's what you've always used._Use what works_ and provides you the level of security that you're looking for personally.**  
  
This is acutally my first system that EVER traded on the 30 minute charts. I typically prefer the hourly. In this case, the performance was substantially higher on the 30 and still took trades about once a day.  
  
I like to stay somewhat active in the market so trading once a day is no big deal for me, considering it's typically through my Blackberry; and the TF applied to the system normally limits the stop outs to no more than 80-90 points.

Madd,  
  
I backtested the GbpJpy from 5/2005 until now and profitability really kicked in about april 2007. It seem to have stagnated during '05 and '06. The same period give better results when the EOD was not checked.

Mudd,  
Several posts ago, you and Mr. Trend were discussing the different results that were seen when enabling/disabling the EOD feature and I recall you sticking with EOD enabled due to a higher winning percentage. I compared the results ( 2 volatility indicators) from 3/26/06-9/5/2007 and I saw that the winning percentage was higher (~6%) however the results with EOD enabled netted ~2000 more pips. I made the same comparison using the original system as well and results with EOD enabled netted over 2000 more pips as well. I am curious to know if you see what I see, and if so, could you give your thoughts on why you'd choose the greater winning percentage over the greater net pip gain, if this is the case? Also, I am forward testing the lastest update (2 volatility indicators) using 1 mini lot, are you currently using this system or the original?

I'm actually trading it with EOD off at the moment. While the win percentage was higher, the NON-EOD setting did enable it to bank more pips per trade which offsets the lower win percentage a majority of the time.  
  
It becomes a risk when you're in the big trades when they hit, but allowing your equity to get chewed little by little on the small losses. You have to find a balance where the scales are tipped slightly in your favor all the time.

Well, for those of you who don't feel compelled to catch the entire movement, but are satisfied with tidbits at a higher lot level....  
  
Try using the Trend Chaser on the 30-150-D EUR/JPY with no EOD and a profit target of **75** pips. You can also use the same system on the GBP/USD with a profit target of **55** pips. This increases the win percentage and makes for an _extremely pretty_ equity curve.

I think it also comes down to who you are as a trader. For example, I know I need to be in a trade most of the time, so I trade nothing but stop and reverse systems... If I closed a trade at EOD and it ended up going another 100 pips in my favor, I'd go nuts.  
  
There isn't anything wrong with that, per se. As long as you are following your plan. You just need to know who you are.

That's as about as true a statement as was ever made.  
  
No system, no time frame, no stop out and take profit level will ever satisfy every trader or even the majority of them.  
  
So, if by some weird chance there is or was a holy grail system out there, leave it to forex traders to bugger it all up!![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f644.png?v=15.1)

You have to increase the number of bars in memory. Mine won't accept anymore than 29-30K....I think Mr. Trend has gone much further back.

The best you can do is 29000 bars in memory, and I have the server collect data back to 1/1/2005. If you're serious about creating a system and have one where you think it's definitely worth working on some more, then I would suggest buying tick data. If you have an account with [Oanda](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile"), you can get free tick data. And OandA is known for their data before they started as a big broker, so...

No stop loss. The trailing volatility line will call a flat if the price returns back across or a stop and reverse if the price penetrates both lines in the same time frame. With the .004/.005 settings, the loss level is within a controlled range.   
  
I typically also put on a trading platform stop loss that is higher than where the system would call a flat just in the event of a major move due to unforseen events.

Posted are the .SI4 files for the EUR/JPY, EUR/USD, and GBP/USD.  
  
This is a short take profit method with a higher win percentage. The TP's are 75 for EUR/JPY, 55 for GBP/USD, and 40 for EUR/USD.

The very first time I started using the trailing volatility indicator, I was using it on the EUR and GBP on the 13 minute chart for small quick trades.....and that was about last fall sometime.

Thanks, bapxzy! I appreciate it.  
  
Lep, the differing settings act as a type of deadband between long and short to filter noise that maybe strong enough to close one position but not have the ability to carry through with the next position. If you had ever tried the Dolly sytem on MT4, it acted in the same manner with a deadband around the open that had to be crossed by price to the topside or bottomside prior to intitaiting a trade. It's also a popular method for daily chart traders who will place entries above and below the previous days close.

That explains it, I wondered why longs were using 0.004 and shorts were 0.005 but that makes sense now

I have enjoyed your thread and have followed it since the beginning. I noticed that your system is very much like the BAT strategy: <http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=12808>.

This volatility stop is based on Parabolic stop of a moving average. It looks surprisingly similar to the FT version. 

It really is that easy.

Right, it basically steps behind price. The useful part of this indicator is that it can be used within a range as well as a trend; dependant on how you set the step parameters and the use of any deadbands.

Hey MUDD  
  
Long time no see. Glad to see you up and running. Maybe one day we can compare notes on what has gone on lately.  
  
Interesting system you've got here. I am still with FXSol and their accucharts.  
  
Have developed a couple systems myself that work pretty well, still fine tuning them.  
  
Anyway, good to see you.

Trt rebooting and see if that clears it up. Also, check the version and see if you are running version SRV 4 R0. I had problems with the most recent release and had reverted back to the previous version because of error messages and crashing.  
  
Let FT know as well. Email [carlos@fibonaccitrader.com](mailto:carlos@fibonaccitrader.com)

Well, since this was a rather low volatility week, I added two extra pairs to make up for it. I'm only shooting for 25 on EUR/USD positions (83%) and 55 on GBP/USD. 65 on EUR/JPY. This keeps the success rate higher than usual and gets me into some positions, though each one is relatively small.  
  
The GBP/JPY is "No limit, EOD", but of course it can snap at anytime and shoot 200-300.  
  
I've got several differing screens under the "Page" screen that I load and unload depending on how the week is progressing.  
  
A basic two pair screen with the serpents tail, a three pair screen which lacks the GBP/JPY, and the four pair screen when the market is REALLY rangey and quiet.   
  
The EUR/USD is really non-volatile for the most part, so I ALWAYS use a limit on it, otherwise it will chew you up little by little. Go small...around 25-30 at the most. You won't get many, but you will get some.  
  
Sorry about the confusion on the screens....but I will name it whatever seems to make sense to me the most at the time.

Okay, here is a system for eur/usd I made up. Its based on 2 MACDs on a 5m time frame. It is always in, no EOD.  
  
Its made 200 pips per week for 3 weeks. I wish I could back test this further. 73% winning trades, with profit factor greater than 4. Anyway, here it is if anyone wants to improve it, let me know via this thread or PM.

Fantastic, thanks for doing that. So, its not as good as it first appeared, but overall still profitable. at least for the last 6 months ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

As a general rule, if it doesn't look good on at least 300 trades, trash it. Time period, or rather, length of backtest in months, years, etc., really doesn't matter.

Thanks for the advice Mr. Trend.  
  
On another note. Anyone here able to, or know someone who can convert MT4 or VT indicators into visual basic form for Fibonacci Trader?  
  
There are some ideas I been dying to try out, but FT doesnt have the required indicators. I am mainly looking at the qqe indicator that was converted from Virtual trader to MT4. This indicator in FT with its multi time frame capabilities would be powerful.

You can always email carlos over at FT. Just email the support email. He'll most likely offer to do it as long as you are open to it being public. if not, he can point you to people who will, for a charge.  
  
Also, bear in mind that you cannot automate Forex trades in FT.

I received a reply from Carlos, he said he would be willing to code the qqe indicator but needed additional information, like how its calculated mathematically etc. I gave him a mq4 version of it, so hopefully that is enough to code from. I"ll post it here as if/when I receive it.

Hey everyone!  
  
I just wanted to post a quick update on these methods...  
  
One thing to look out for when testing is the number of trades made during the particular time period. 8000+ pips over 2 years sounds great until you factor in that it took 800 trades to do so @ 9pips spread per trade. A lot of results seem to be skewed due to this.  
  
I am still unsure if I will be subscribing - I am finding that the program is hanging at times and does not send out the appropriate open or close position. There also seems to be some 'slippage' from when the signal goes out to when you receive it and manage to enter the trade (probably my txt message provider). On top of this I am frequently inside RF emission free zones due to my work requirements. I have missed a few signals so far because of these issues...  
  
And btw, the majority of the systems posted fail miserably in the first half of 2004 - nice gains are pretty well 100% given back in the span of a few months. It has been clear sailing since, however so all is not lost. Just shows how fickle this beast can be!  
  
Take care all & good luck with your trades!

Just a thought--when we take human discretion out of the picture (good discretion I mean) and rigidly follow a system, aren't all systems subject to fail over the long run? Unless a system can adapt to new conditions and markets, which is ultimately really only reasonably possible through a human's intervention, isn't even the best system bound to fail?  
  
If a system produces great results for 20 years, but blows up on year 21, what's the point? I suppose a solution would be to say that the max drawdown be at a certain percentage, say, 40% or something--when it reaches that drawdown, shut it down. But then it would be time to switch systems, and the system-hopper would be at it again. Ultimately, isn't trader psychology the key, regardless of the system? So why this endless search for systems that have backtested well over the last 5 years or something? That really says little about how well it may perform this coming year, right?  
  
Don't mean to get off the topic or anything, but this subject always seems to come up.

And you made some good points.  
  
While I take back testing into consideration when creating/modifying a system, the results will ultimately be dependant on the trader. I'm not a personal fan of auto trading; I had my shot with it and it worked ok.  
  
I follow the system fairly strictly, but there have been occasion where I've been stopped out repeatedly in the same direction and have backed off taking those directional trades because I realized I was trading against strong momentum.   
  
My biggest problem with the periods where the system seems to tank is why?  
  
The system is based on a simple principle of trailing price action. If there is an extended period where it continually fails, figure out why and adjust.  
  
Do the trailing volatility indicators need tightened due to low volatile market conditions? Should I switch to a higher volatile pair? Should I use a conservative limit of 65-100 pips? Is the volatility SOOO high that good trades are turning bad because I'm staying in too long?  
  
These are discisions that the PC can't make. These need to be made by the trader and the system adjusted.....not scraped....just tweaked to match current conditions.  
  
This is why I mentioned tracking a margin percentage every month or quarter and maintaining as best as possible that margin. If you can comfortably perform 3% at $XXX,XXX.000 then hold yourself to that and track your performance....obviously adjusting as your balance grows to reflect the true margin. When I speak of margin, I'm referring to the business definition whereas a person who sells a job or contract meets a margin requirement laid out by his/her corporation that must be meet. In most companies that would be 35%.  
  
If you see that your performance is dropping month after month, spend some time figuring out why. Is it me? Is it the market?; which would mean it's really me! or is the system needing tightened and adjusted to trade the current volatility levels?

Seems like a good plan MuddBuddha.  
  
As I'm sure you know, there are umpteen methods out there for calculating (in other words, not eyeballing and discretionary human opinion) market conditions and volatility. One is by Kaufman, who calculates what he calls an Adaptable Moving Average and uses an "efficiency ratio" to determine market conditions. Might be something to look into if anyone's interested in that kind of thing. But after looking at it, while it may be helpful to some, I found it's basically just another number to me. I'm not good with indicators in general, they all start to look garbled to me after a while :-) I use multiple moving averages, both guppy, hull, and another here by linuxtroll that he calls the rainbow. They are great for me to visually see what's going on with the trend and it gives fantastic entry opportunities and is great for scalping (exit is based on quick profit as a multiple of amount risked). Sorry for the rambling, and thanks for your reply!

Does anyone else experience FT crashing with an "out of memory" error. The last couple days I get home from work and it says this.   
  
Of course I miss any alerts for opening/closing positions when this happens. I first thought it was because I had too many charts open but I deleted all but 4 charts and it is still occuring. Just curious if anyone has seen it before, I check the help page to no avail.  
  
Oh, and Carlos said he is currently working on the qqe indicator. I'll be sure to post it asap.

It keeps coming up and that's why if you're a systems developer, you have to continously create new systems.  
  
Trading, and the development of systems, needs to be something you enjoy. I don't think enough people get that.  
  
One thing you fail to realize is that systems don't just all of a sudden fail. If you've developed a system and you've been trading it successfully the last two years, and then in year three you make 20% less, and then in year four, you make 20% less than that, then you need to sit up and take notice that the market may be changing for your respective edge.  
  
Hence, why you always need to be looking and working on new systems.  
  
If you don't like that, then you don't develop systems. You trade discretionary with certain rules.  
  
Discretion is fine. It's just another way to trade.

Mr T, this is actually a huge issue I've been dealing with, and reading this strengthens my own conviction in the way I believe. I think this was the missing piece of the whole "system" puzzle for me--I liked the concept, but knew that a single one would never work forever, and the thought of searching and designing over and over made me want to find some other way of making money. You've helped me to realize that I don't have to take that route--thank you very much, I feel like a huge monkey has been lifted off of my shoulders...!!!!

Hello, first of of thanks for the system...It seems interesting to test it and everything. I have installed everything and is now sending the signals to my cell and all that.  
  
However, please can you tell me how you do to test it on hystorical data and see that profit lines you show here. I want to tweeak it, but testing on history first. Also where I can put on the system for a desired amount of pips per trade and then force a stop or so.  
  
Thanks and congrats to the creator, hope this takes all of us out of the rat race. lol

Hey guys, Carlos came through on the QQE indicator. Problem is that its an exe file and is 1.6mb and I can't post on the forums because its an exe and its too big, even after I zip it. If you want it just pm me your email and I will send it too you. If you want to thank Carlos, just send him a thanks via FT's website.  
  
Carlos's instructions were to shut down all programs then run the exe. It will install the quantitative qualitative estimation indicator for you. Reboot and then start building systems.  
  
I got one for gbp/jpy I'll post later when I get back to my home pc.

Here is the first one I came up with. Its simply the QQE crossover on a 60 min chart and a 30,10,10 stochastic as a filter. I set TP at a hard 150 and stop is 100 pip trailing. The remarkable thing about this on is its equity curve, max drawdown of 62 pips. I wish I could backtest it further. But here it is.

Here is another one, its a 4hr chart with just the plain QQE Stop and Reverse on the cross. 12,600 pips in 2 years.

I am using 5 usually, I have toyed with 1 and 60, like auslanco's 15 min strategy.   
  
I've made one up for it and its profitable, but its win rate is only in the 40% range using 60 sl and 100 tp defaults, I think the key is entering on the 5sma pullback which I can't duplicate in FT.  
  
But, the system I posted above using the 4hr bars, you are holding it for a a considerable amount of time. If a guy were to just take the long signals from it, even if the trade is negative some pips he could bank some mean swap.

I have been doing visual backtest with QQE smoothing 1 on 30min gbp/jpy no stop loss no take profit just pure stop and reverse and it looks promising. I'll try backtest this properly when I can.

But in hindsight, that's the case with GBPJPY. You don't know what the future will bring, and you don't know if we're gonna have another two year tear up.  
  
Tread lightly with systems on GBPJPY. Make sure that the theory behind your system makes sense... that's the key. Anyone could've bought on dips last two years and would've made bank.  
  
The question is how would this system do during range markets? If it breaks even, then you might be ok -- here's why:  
  
You can't realistically expect most systems to perform well during all types of markets -- hence why systems degrade over a set amount of time. But what you can look for when creating systems is those periods of time where your system is not necessarily supposed to perform that well but yet DD is kept to a minimum. THAT is a good system, because if a pair (like GBPJPY) has a tendancy to trend over a lengthy period of time, the odds are that you will be safe with a trend-based system. So if you do get rangy periods, and it breaks even or is slightly positive, then you are in good shape. You can at least stop using it after a certain period of "breakevenness", and turn to your range-based strategy.  
  
On the other hand, if you are backtesting a system that is based on trending theory, and see that it performs horribly in a ranging market on an otherwise trending pair, then you should be careful, because you never know when that market is going to change and you will lose a chunk of capital.  
  
Hope that makes sense.

That makes perfect sense Mr. Trend. And its good you come in here and keep us all honest ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
You put that same system above on most other currencies and it fails horribly. I guess you have to know the pair your trading. If you had a great ranging system, you could probably make a killing on a pair like gbp/eur.

Hmmm.. yeah. Not very robust.  
  
That's not to say you can't trade it. There are plenty of systems that work fine on one pair and one pair only. But generally you have a really good system if it works across a few pairs.  
  
Some of the most robust systems work on indices.

I managed to download and display data back to Jan-3, 2005 for the system on 4hr bars. Attached display (if it works) should show profitability and equity curve.  
  
The equity curve was flat until Nov-2005 before it took off. Why? I'm not sure - I just did this, so haven't had a chance to review. Worth looking at further to understand.  
  
To retrieve this much history, I set the max bars at 29,700 (click the FT logo at top left of chart) and I downloaded history from the FT Server - right click on chart, choose FT server, then update 240min bars. Less charts you have and open for the GJ, the quicker the download will work.  
  
The MFE and MAE stats under the Show Detail option in Results offer some valuable data. MFE illustrates that on a number of trades, a lot of pips were left on the table before the system triggered the reversal. You can export these stats into an Excel sheet and then write formulas to identify effective profit targets and also perhaps stop loss values.   
  
There's a lot more when you scratch under the covers.   
  
Hope that helps.

Yeah, there has been a lot of useful contribution so far. I installed Lep's indicator last night and am running that system beside the EUR/JPY Trend Chaser today. So far I'm very impressed. I made a couple of small changes to suite my own taste, but the core system is the same.

One thing that I neglected to mention while using FT4 SRV is that you can trend your systems performance and use discretion as to when to trade the system and when not to.  
  
Here are the P/L charts of the GBP/JPY and EUR/JPY versions of Trend Chaser.  
  
Notice where I've enclosed the 10 and 20 MA crossovers....the P/L charts display when the system is in a period of drawdown. Most of the time the actual cross of the 10/20 is about the same time as the drawdown period is over; but a change in slope can indicate that market conditions have changed and you should use more discretion.   
  
I'm posting this in response to a couple of comments I recieved about the stop outs at the beginning of the week. I switched over to the EUR/JPY and traded my way through it after a couple of GBP/JPY stop outs.  
  
Keep an eye on your P/L reports. While they may not represent your actual P/L experience, they are a useful tool to determine market conditions and adjust your trading strategy appropriately.

I developed a version of this for EOD daily trading which can be used on ProRealTime charts. ProRealTime is java based....can be used on any PC....and is 100% free for EOD use.  
  
The TrendChaser FX version on ProRealTime can be used on several pairs and only needs to be checked once a day.  
  
Here are .jpgs and a text file on settings it up.

Wouldn't like this thread to fall by the wayside as I do like the FT product and use it extensively. Mechanical systems are always going to have some weakness, like leaving pips on the table and being unable to spot support/resistance.  
  
Anyway, has anyone made progress in tweaking the systems or indicators or in using them to trade? Problem I found on GBP/JPY is that spread is big, this beastie moves quick and from alert time to actual trade execution via SMS alert can be 30 or 50 pips on occasion. So the results ain't quite what they seem.  
  
Let's keep this thread going, eh?

Yeah, it was more or less just a distribution thread to get the files into everybodys hands; not really a discussion thread. The original two plus the GBP are probably about as good as they'll get. It would be nice for others to post other pairs as they get them testing efficiently and share them. Also look forward to seeing variants of the existing systems for other time frames.

Well, the Fibonacci Trader SRV charting software gets it's price feed from [FXCM](/brokers/fxcm "View FXCM Broker Profile"); but you could use any broker you like. Fibonacci Trader has a deal where you can get the charting software for free by opening an account with FXCM and trading 70 mini lots or 7 standards per month. That's always something you could explore.  
  
The account link is on FT's website.

Hi matrixebiz,  
  
Sounds like you are new to trading. Welcome to this mad world. You are in for a wild ride!  
  
Mudd, mentioned a broker earlier in this thread. I forget which, so start from post #1 and skim through til you find it.  
  
Minimum money to open an account. That is easy. ZERO!!!  
  
Since you do appear to be new to trading, the worst thing you can do is open a live account with real money. You should demo trade exclusively until you are fully confident in the system you are using, and are also consistently profitable.  
  
When, and only when, you've met the above conditions should you open a live account. When you do, run away as fast as you can from opening a mini account with only $300. You would have to start your trading with 10000/300 = 33.33:1 true leverage. That amount of leverage is insane, even for an experienced trader. If you don't know the difference between true leverage and broker leverage, then take a look at my sticky in the beginners forum.  
  
When you do open a live account, the minimum amount you should deposit in my opinion is twice the size of the lot you'll be trading. For example, if you open a micro account (highly recommended), each microlot is valued at 1000 units, so you should deposit $2000. If you open a mini account (NOT recommended if your account is under $40,000) then your minimum deposit should be $20,000.

Love the avatar. Division Bell was, by far, the groups greatest work. I listen to the album almost weekly. It's a good "unwind" album while you enjoy a cold beer and an expensive cigar.  
  
Anyway, I've got a 5M Quick Trade for the EUR/JPY .SI4 that I use to fill the gaps when the 30 min system has gone flat.  
  
Here ya go.  
  
It has an excellent equity curve on the results. Keep in mind that this is for Fibonacci Trader SRV charting software ONLY. It will not work with MT4....and no, I will not port it as I know nothing about MT4 programming.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Here is the final version of TrendChaserFX on the 30-150-D charts.  
  
I'm using it exclusively on the EUR/JPY as the equity curve is unbeatable.   
  
If you have any questions, let me know. If you have any mods that possibly improve performance, PLEASE LET ME KNOW!!!  
  
I've been working on this system for a year and feel it is about as close to perfection as it can get. Unfortunately, the indicators involved are specific to Fibonacci Trader SRV and I don't feel like putting in the time to learn programming just to port it to another platform.  
  
I moved my accounts to FXCM as I get the FT SRV platform for free each month that way. It aint so bad....  
  
IF, by chance, any of you port this to MT4 with the same back test results, please let me know as soon as possible. Thanks.

the nicest guys in the world like classical rock, progressive and Pink Floyd. This is not a opinion, but a fact. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
but about the system what was your maximum consecutives losses with that new on 5m and the trendchase?   
  
woulbe nice if someone could write an EA for both systems. The code of the volatulity indicator is open?

The 5 minute is 10. The 30 TrendChaser is 4. I'm working on fine tuning th 5 as much as possible in my freetime. There is a better version available for download from [TrendChaserFX.com](http://trendchaserfx.com), as well as screens of the current equity P/L's.  
  
I'm using the GBP/JPY, GBP/USD, & EUR/JPY personally and only using the 5 minute QuickTrade when bored. I'll get it nailed down to a smoother equity curve eventually. Gotta just keep bangin away at it.

Hi MuddBuddha, thanks for sharing this system, I'd like to make some questions about things that didn't find in the thread:

  1. Do you close trades at the end of friday? Do you open trades at start of sunday if there's a signal? I guess sometimes the gap can mislead the indicators, how do you manage that?
  2. I wonder if you could post the backtest with the performance results window, the one with gross profit, gross loss, net factor, etc.; my problem is that I used my SRV 14 day trial time before, so I can't take a look without suscribe, this last issue leads me to the third question...
  3. I guess since it is a paid service, the answer is obvious, but anyway, have anybody managed to open a secound trial of FT SRV? is that possible? or are we logged with the I.P.or something inside computer?

Thanks for reading.

In your "read me" file you mention the price of FT SRV and then say "as well as the SMS charges".  
Just curious what those charges might be.

The SMS charges will depend on your phone carrier if you use FT to alert you to a trade via mobile email (highly recommended). Most carriers charge $.10 per text without a SMS package. I have a 200 per month package through AT&T/Cingular for $4.99, which is reasonable.

Been looking at this Fibonacci Trader. Seems quite unique I have to say. I especially like the divergence indicator that's already integrated into the platform, and you can apply it to any indicator.  
  
Shame MT4 doesn't have that feature.

I'll agree with you there. The ONE thing that has kept me with FT SRV over the last few years is the unique assortment of indicators and the ease of use when designing and backtesting systems. I prefer to concentrate on systems performance and my own trading than learning to program code. Especially when your time is split between this and the rest of your life.

Thanks for your answer MuddBuddha. If something comes up I'll let you know.   
  
BTW, are you using SMS instead of email to receive the signals? don't they arrive delayed sometimes?

I have a BlackBerry which has its own email address through AT&T. It doesn't incur any SMS text charges to send the phone an email as it has a constant "EDGE" network connection. I switched over from T-Mobile to AT&T because of the delay I was experiencing with T-Mobile. AT&T emails typically arrive within 60 seconds of sending as long as I am in a data coverage area.

I don't trade from my BlackBerry, just monitor trade signals. You can trade with a BB and Smart phone using GFT, [Forex.com](/brokers/forexcom "View FOREX.com Broker Profile"), TBS, and thinkorswim. Those are the only FX brokers I know off the top of my head that have both Windows/BlackBerry phone platforms. GFT has the nicest and most stable. When I first started this thread I was still with GFT primarily.

I've read that you moved to [FXCM](/brokers/fxcm "View FXCM Broker Profile") to receive the SRV charts for free, but they don't have mobile platform, so, how do you manage your trades now? what do you do if you are in a BBQ or in the street and a signal email arrives? are you carrying a lap all the time?

Well, the one pro-active thing I do is monitor the charts regularly so I'm aware of when a potential trade may be coming up. During the week I'm typically around a PC somewhere, but still may get pulled into meetings and what not. That may cause me to miss a trade from time to time. Most of the 30 minute systems have limits, so I'm okay there. If I feel it may get stopped out, I'll put a hard stop where the volatility line is and let it run. Normally I only use an "emergency" stop of 150 pips from entry so if something happens and I cannot access a PC due to weather, car accident, etc., I won't go bankrupt.  
  
It would be great if FXCM would come out with a mobile platform as I felt a bit more secure with it, even though I didn't use it all that often. They do intend on supporting MT-4 in early 2008 which has a mobile platform, so I would need to switch phones.

I have the signals sent to my AT&T/YAHOO DSL email account and for free they alert my cell phone.  
  
The last alert a few minutes ago was under 10 seconds from the time the computer alerted to the time my phone beeped with the text message from FT SRV.  
  
A few earlier alarms took 15 to 20 seconds.  
  
MuddBuddha keep an eye on EFX's Remote Trader software which should have a full release this Jan./08. Its free like Metatrader and has been developed as a Metatrader replacement to trade through EFX. Not having your broker deal against you is huge. The software will be accessible from any Internet Explorer enabled brower plus have full mobile accessiblilty.  
  
Their full indicator programming language won't be released until a few months later and it remains to be seen if it could duplicate your "trailing volatility" indicators but this is the software of the future!!!!...as far as free one's go.

Thanks to the market volatility today, the EUR/JPY and GBP/USD closed out three trades since midnight. Couldn't ask for a better end to the year.  
  
I contacted a MQL programming company about trans-coding to MT4, they turned it down, saying it couldn't be done. I'll try a couple of others and see what happens. Would be nice to have the trades auto execute as long as the equity P/L was VERY, VERY similar to the current system.

**New .SI4 revisions for EUR/JPY, GBP/JPY & GBP/USD have been posted for download @ TrendChaserFX.com!!**  
  
Once unzipped and imported, the system should end with the extension "**1.F** ".  
  
Please use these new files. You should see a 0.6 to 1.7% performance increase. Doesn't sound like a lot, but compounded over time, it kinda adds up.

For those of you trading the GBP/JPY TrendChaserFX system, try changing the PROFIT PROTECTION LIMIT to 125 points for a smoother equity curve.  
  
You might find it easier to digest the swings.

Here is a screen of the new GBP/JPY P/L curve with the 125 Profit Protection Limit. The equity ONLY smoothed using 125. Even lower values caused high peaks and valleys.

Yeah, it was a hell of an improvement. I'd been trying for a while to figure out the right TP level to smooth that pair out.   
  
The other night I was studying the performance report and saw that the back test said AVERAGE WINNING TRADE = 1.26 (126). So, I decided to try the average win with no stop loss and no RSI.   
  
Badda bing, badda boom, now you've got yourself a smoother curve....go figure.

Good luck on those positions tonight. GY already went SHORT on that Nikkei plunge and it looks like the EY may follow suit on the back of a stronger YEN.  
  
4% is a huge plunge on the Nikkei. So much so that the ticker on CNBC stopped updating.  
  
FYI, auto trading _MAY BE_ possible using FT SRV through [Interactive Brokers](http://http://individuals.interactivebrokers.com/en/main.php). I've put in a inquiry to FT to be sure that the SRV version is supported for the auto trading. I'll let you know as soon as they get back to me. You have to download and install the individual API's for the position file to be created and a trade generated. Would be nice if it would work out.

**New .SI4 revisions for EUR/JPY, GBP/JPY & EUR/USD have been posted for download @ TrendChaserFX.com!!**  
  
Once unzipped and imported, the system should end with the extension "**1.G** ".  
  
Please use these new files. Credit goes to FXTRADERA for providing the ideas for the new revisions. These revisions carry more than double the profit potential of the original systems. Again, keep in mind that the GBP/JPY is a highly volatile pair, and while the system is VERY profittable, it is very volatile at times. You may want to keep a bottle of Mylanta handy. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Happy to find your thread here again.  
Looks interesting and promising, I didn't have time to check everything out yet (my broker is using MT4), but I somehow trust you, man, and I am happy that you are posting.  
  
My best wishes and prosperity to you for year 2008!

Appreciate it. Hope you have good success with the .SI4 files! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) It never hurts to try out something new and see if it suites your style of trading.

Mudd, i have contacted Newdigital from Forex Tsd forum and he said that if i give him all rules detailed problably he will got some friend like Igorad or other to code a EA for Metatrader. Maybe the indicator used is a problem but he said that is possible to make using another indicator. Igorad made a lot of indicators for Metatrader.   
  
it is possible to post the rules/logic to help to creat a EA? or if you prefer send me in private o enter in contact with Newdigital at Forex Tsd.  
  
but i think post here is better so others can try do make a EA for Metatrader.   
  
i was running the system for somes days am entered here to compare the signals but as i can see you are running another version.  
  
if a EA can be made it will be far more easy to compare results in foward tests.  
  
many thanks again for share the system and updates.  
  
and sorry for my bad english. hope you understood. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61e.png?v=15.1)

Your chart timeframe should be set to 30-150-DAILY. That looks like a DAILY Chart which is why your signals are so short.  
  
I'll work on getting the rules set down so I can post them.

I realized last night that I had not included a README file for the .SI4 files. Hopefully there weren't too many people confused by the trade alerts?  
  
Systems overview:  
  
*NOTE: The first numeric of the time period line is the proper time frame to trade the system on. 30-150-D would be the 30 minute chart. 5-25-75 would be the 5 minute chart. D-W-M would be the DAILY chart. Deviation from the designed timeframe may result in negative equity P/L.  
  
1.G Systems: Trade (2) lots at position open with a trailing stop loss and set limit that both shed (1) lot when triggered. Upon shedding, the remaining lot position stays active until stopped out and reversed by the Trailing Volatility indicator, or runs to profit and is called flat at the appropriate limit level. The 1.G systems, which currently is all pairs except GBP/USD and EUR/USD Ichimoku Standard, incorporate the use of the RSI/Volatility indicators to filter trades.  
  
1.F Systems: GBP/USD ONLY. Trade (1) lot at a set limit and no stop loss. The trade is called FLAT when price penetrates and closes below or above the opposing Trailing Volatility indicator. This system does not utilize the RSI as a filter.  
  
Ichimoku Standard – EUR/USD: Trades on the DAILY chart. Rules are based strictly on the Ichimoku crossover method of the Tenkan line and Kijun line. The RSI is used a an entry filter. Trades are called FLAT when the lines cross back the opposing direction.  
  
Hopefully this clears up any confusion. I apologize for not including the README. Got a little distracted by the playoffs. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

no. my chart is 30 too. And looking your chart the signals looks like the same. Only the signal #1 and #4 (right to left) are different. #4 is 5 bars after mine signal to buy.  
  
i think my fuso is correct. here in Brazil is gmt-3 and we are in DST. FT is showing -2 so i think is correct. I don't know what can be wrong.

giraia br,  
  
Right click on the screen and select, "THIS SYMBOL" > "EDIT SYMBOL PARAMETERS".  
  
For TRADING TIMES make sure SATURDAY is unchecked. End the week at FRIDAY @ 19:00 GMT and start the week on SUNDAY @ 08:00 GMT. Make sure your pip size is set to .01 and the decimal is 2.  
  
Let's see if that helps. Also, take a screenshot where the dates are visible.   
  
Let's try that and see what happens. Did you have this issue with the 1.F version>?

Okay, well, the heart of the system is the Trailing Volatility indicator. It works much like the Chandlier Stop and Danton Stop. It trails price at a value which represents it's offset to price. As price moves away, the TV indicator moves with it and sets it's position at the close. I could tell you the TV period for this system is .04 for one and .06 for the other. Once price has penetrated the TV line and closed, the TV line swings the other way to represent the new FLAT line.  
  
If the TV indicator can be coded properly, the rest will probably be a piece of cake. The RSI acts as a trend filter; but let's see if anyone can mimick the TV indicator first and then we'll start on the next part.  
  
Quote from other site:  
  
_"Simply, if the trend is considered up, then the trend of prices are composed of upwaves and the downwaves are countertrend movements. Downward trends are the opposite, seen as downwaves with countertrend upwaves. Using several tools and functions, we can design a quantifiable approach to defining these waves. My favorite is the volatility indicator, which is a formula that measures the market volatility by plotting a smoothed average of the true range. The true range indicator originates from the work of J. Welles Wilder Jr. from his New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems. The definition of the true range is defined as the largest of the following:_

  1. _The difference between today's high and today's low_
  2. _The difference between today's high and yesterday's close, or_
  3. _The difference between today's low and yesterday's close._

_The calculation uses a 21-period weighted average of the true range, giving higher weight to the true range of the most recent bar. The final value is then multiplied by 3._  
  
_The volatility indicator is used as a stop-and-reverse method. Let's say the market has been rising, then the volatility indicator is calculated each day and subtracted from the highest close during the rising market. The highest close is always used, even if there has been a series of lower closes since the highest close. If the market closes below the volatility indicator, then for the next day, the current reading of the volatility indicator is added to the lowest close. This step is followed each day until the market closes above the trailing volatility indicator. We now have a definition of the trend. An upward trend exists as long as the volatility indicator is below the market and a downtrend is in force if the volatility indicator is above the market."_  
  
And from another site:  
  
_"__VOLATILITY INDICATOR  
  
Editor,  
  
The September 1998 article “Trading The Trend” by Andrew Abraham, in which he presented a volatility indicator, doesn’t provide the information necessary for the educated layman who is interested in technical analysis. In my opinion, it should have provided more detail on some areas.  
  
I understand the calculation of a 21- period weighted average of the true range, but why is the final value multiplied by 3? Is the volatility indicator in a rising market calculated by subtracting the 21-period weighted average of the true range from the highest close in the same 21-period?  
  
Then when the market closes below the volatility indicator, is the volatility indicator calculated by adding the next day’s value of the 21-period weighted average of the true range to the lowest close in the 21 periods? I hope you can clarify this for me.  
  
TONY RAMSELAAR, via E-mail  
  
Weert, The Netherlands  
  
The volatility indicator discussed by Abraham in the article was originally introduced by J. Welles Wilder in New Concepts In Technical Trading, published by Trend Research in 1978, available from the Delta Society (336 698- 0500). Wilder explains that the constant used in the volatility system can range from 2.80 to 3.10 and was found by testing. The volatility indicator is a trailing stop-and-reverse approach. The volatility indicator is the average true range multiplied by the constant and subtracted from the highest close for long positions. Thus, if you are long, you should go short if the market closes below the volatility indicator. While you are short, the volatility indicator is added to the lowest close, and you go long if the market closes above the volatility indicator.  
  
I hope this helps to fill in the gaps for you.—Editor"_  
  
Please let me know as soon as you can if any of you are successful or need to ask questions. I'd be thrilled to have an EA for this on MT4!

FYI, CMS has a similar type system built into VT Trader called, "Level Stop-Reverse System".  
  
So if any of you know VT, that's the system you want to copy from. It still needs a secondary TV line, but all in good time.

It's hard to tell with the candles instead of bars, but yes, it looks ok.  
  
Nice that the market FINALLY started to cooperate today with some profit. New Years hangover may finally be wearing off. Now if only chicken little would stop declaring recesion, we may be back in business with a more cooperative DOW.  
  
I updated the website with both the 1.G and 1.F versions. I got a few PM's asking for them back.

Hi,  
  
I've found the solution for Trailing Volatility indicator. This indicator haven't nothing common with adaptive indicators because it's based on Envelopes(Close) with period=1 and Deviation (ex.0.005 and 0.009 on screenshot).  
  
This indi (TrendEnvelopes_v3)for MT4 you can find at TSD very soon.  
  
Kind Regards,  
Igor

Thank you very much Igorad, your coding skills are well known and appreciated.  
  
I had made the same observation about the trailing volatility indicator a while back. I would posted that information in this thread but I haven't been paying much attention to the forums for the last few weeks.  
  
Getting this indicator for MT4 would be fantastic, it would open the doors for EA coders to experiment and the idea sharing can begin anew between FT SRV and MT4 since both are using the same tools.  
  
I will be watching forex-tsd. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Thanks!, Got it loaded. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Now once we incorporate the RSI as a trend filter on entries and set a working limit of 65 pips, we should have a working version of "1.F".   
  
It will be interesting to see how it does.

Hello,  
  
Can we use this indicator instead of using the Fibonaccitrader software?

Hi Mudd,  
  
What RSI settings do you use?

You could. The indicator is a great start but I think we're still a little away from a full blown copy cat system.  
  
If you post the two side by side, you'll see what I'm talking about. We still need a bar coloring to indicate LONG, SHORT, and FLAT zones, and the RSI as the trend filter, but you could add the RSI or MACD currently and manually trade decently.  
  
I don't think it will be too long for a full blown EA.

The RSI is a standard 14.  
  
The 1.G system uses the RSI whereas the 1.F does not. You could use the MT4 MACD @ 12.26 standard settings to substitute.

NOW YOU CAN!!

  
Indicators are .zip'd on the website along with indicator settings. Still need a trailing stop EA to shine it up. If anyone has one for MT, let me know. This is strictly for MANUAL trading as it is only a collection of indicators; no EA yet. HUGE thanks to everyone who has been working their butts off on this.

I neglected to add the stepma indicator that makes the choppybars work. Fotunately it was pointed out to me before too much time passed.  
  
I'll post this on the website tonight as well.

So.....why do some of the MT4 platforms work without the StepMA and some do not?  
  
Anyone have any insight that can clear it up for me?

Hi,  
  
I cant beleive what youve done here. Giving something of value away for.. ermmm... Free. Very strangely nice of you. I dont see that very often.  
  
Ive been to the site, and as someone above said, the MT4 indicator download link is not working. Is there anyother way to get hold of it?  
  
Thanks for sharing.

Here's what the current version of the MT4 TrendChaserFX looks like. This is with the StepMA indicator included.  
  
For anyone using it, I would stick with the 65pip limit as with the FT version as it provided for the best back testing results with the smoothest P/L curve which was the whole point of developing it the way I did.  
  
I'm really liking and excited about where the MT4 version is going!

Quick question Mudda, from your experience is backtesting on Fibonacci Trader relatively reliable?  
  
Thanks.

Okay, the .SI4's are only for the Fibonacci Trader SRV charting package.  
  
There are seven available on the website:  
  
30-150-D EUR/JPY TrendChaserFX 1.F/1.G  
30-150-D GBP/JPY TrendChaserFX 1.F/1.G  
30-150-D GBP/USD TrendChaserFX 1.F  
5-25-275 EUR/JPY 5 Minute Quicktrade 1.G  
D-W-M EUR/USD Ichimoku Standard 1.G  
  
We're got a batch of MT4 indicators on the website that now mimick the FT SRV version (1.F) fairly well, and will soon have an EA. The MT4 indicators are in a .zip file posted prior to the .SI4 files on the website. The MT4 indicators only show entry and reversal into a FLAT or opposing position. They don't show limits. These will need to be entered manually. They were E/J = 65, G/J = 75, G/U = 65 for the 30 minute systems (1.F versions).  
  
I've been runing them side by side and the entrys are identical for the most part.

Well, if we're not talking tick charts, then yes, I believe so. All of the systems I've created on FT all enter based on the close which I always observed as the most reliable.  
  
Now the P/L results differ slightly from real life as there is no accounting for spread and other delaying factors in opening the trade. The data feed for FT is through [FXCM](/brokers/fxcm "View FXCM Broker Profile") and I have noticed in several cases where the trade has reached limit on FT, but my trading platform, also FXCM, didn't trigger the limit. The prices should be identical and the limit should be the limit, so I have no explanation for it right now.

Just FYI:  
  
The MT4 version also works really well on the 5 minute chart and the Yen crosses.

MT4 Indicator Usage:  
  
When price crosses and closes above or below the StepMA line the indicator will signal a trade by displaying the bar as either blue for LONG, or red for SHORT.   
  
Once in the trade the bar color remains the same until price starts to retrace at which time the bar color will lighten. You can either stay in and watch for reversal or close out and wait for an opposing trade or re-enter if the bar color darkens again.  
  
If price retraces back inside the Trend Bars, price will go FLAT (white), indicating no trade is available. Typically for a LONG, the RSI should be above 50 and below 50 for a SHORT.  
  
I prefer this system on the 5 minute, 30 minute, and daily charts. I feel those provide the right trend channels to profit on a regular basis. Some pairs have more "pattern persistance" than others. JPY crosses are known for this as are most GBP pairs. The CAD, however, can abruptly change direction and doesn't seem suited for this type of system.

Hi MuddBuddha  
  
Thank you for a good thread and food for thought.  
  
Could you share what your parameters are for the MT4 StepChoppyBars_v2 indicator?  
  
Thanks in advance.

Mudd Buddha was a EA ever developed for this system I have been trading it manually for some time with great success.

If you have any problems with the links, let me know.

So there is still no EA for this strategy MuddBuddha? What a shame   
Poocher I just trade the original ones that MuddBuddha used it on, Euro & US sessions are the best times to get a signal from them. An email alert would be the next best thing to attach to the trend envelopes but I am no coder not even close. Sorry to hear about your web site Muddbudda there are some strange people in this world that we all live in.

If you go into the properties of the step bars, you can change the colors. I eliminated the colors for all exept the blue and red for personal preference. You can do it any way that suites you.

Yeah, I thought we were close to an EA, but it never developed into something tradeable. I don't code either so I'm stuck living off the [generosity](http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0geu7z6oQ9IAisAKx5XNyoA/SIG=15m81qa7s/EXP=1209070458/**http%3a//search.yahoo.com/search%3fei=UTF-8%26fr=b2ie7%26p=generosity%26SpellState=n-3678822577_q-t%252FBEB7qPkk0wKFPZ9td%252FKwAAAA%2540%2540%26fr2=sp-qrw-corr-top)of others.

So I take it everyone is using mostly the MT4 version. Still a great version, but lacks the notification of the FT SRV version. Unless you're trading full time, I'd stay with the MT4 though.  
  
The site thing was a pain. I'm used to getting a lot of hits from the US and Russia (don't know why, but they seem to like me in Russia?), but then started getting hits from Bulgaria on the order of 2500 a day. A little peeking into the file changes and I noticed that they were attempting to hack the blog and change the php code. Dang nine year olds have nothing better to do with their time??!!!   
  
Anyway, the site is blog free, so it should be fine. Eventually, I swear, I will have the chat room back in operation. I know alot of people miss the chat room here at FF.

A few have asked about my current version Vs. the one posted on the website. For the most part it's the same basic principal except I no longer use the StepMA and StepRSI and have been using the Ravi as an entry guide.  
  
I've posted the Ravi on the website for those who would like to try it out.

Hello, MuddBuddha. actually it's quite easy to use MT4 to send you notifications, including phone calls. I've incorporated this function into one of my EAs, which I've attached here. you can either copy the appropriate function and paste it to your own EA, or send me your EA and I'll make the relevant changes for you.  
  
to make the phone calls work you need to have either a phone line connected directly to your PC thorugh an analogue modem, or have skype installed.  
  
let me know if you have any problem with this.

This is basically how I've been using the system as of late. It's simple and keeps me sleeping during the night. Appreciate the post iplaygames.  
  
I've also added language translation to the site as it has been getting many overseas hits. Hope it helps out.

Absolutely. **_1000% YES!_**  
  
Yes, you lose out on some points, but more consistent profits add up faster than those few lost points.

I still like the stepchoppy bars on mt4.  
  
Its nice even to scalp with in the direction of the trend.  
  
On one minute going from red to white bars for buys and from blue to white bars for sells.  
  
But there has to be good movement in the trend for this to work and I just look at yen crosses for this scalp.  
  
As always...Thanks MuddBuddha!!!![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

IF you're trading this on the 5 minute chart, I would change the deviation on the trend envelopes to **.002** instead of the default **.005**.

And **.003** seems to work best on the 15 minute charts. I'll post these details on the website later today.

Hey, in case anyone is interested, [FXCM](/brokers/fxcm "View FXCM Broker Profile") is now providing MT4 downloads. No demo yet, however.  
  
This works out well as my FT SRV (free) subscription was dependent on the # of trades per month on my FXCM account.

Here are the .tpls' for the 5, 15, and 30 minute time frames. Of all, the 15 is my favorite to trade from.  
  
These templates rely on you having the Ravi installed. It can be found from the website if you need it.

Here's a small variation of the TrendChaserFX template on the 15 minute chart. It has the "trend guard" concept that I had on the .SI4 files for FT SRV.  
  
Basically, the trend guard indicates the intermediate trend direction via two higher deviation lines (envelopes), while the shorter deviation indicates entry points; the most proffitable and safest obviously being in the direction of the intermediate trend.  
  
Again, it relies on the use of the Ravi, or your choice of secondary confirmation indicators. You can grab the Ravi from TimeFreedoms post up above.

For those using FT SRV, I contacted Carlos to see if he could help out with getting the RAVI for FT. Hopefully he'll be kind and pop out the coded indicator.

Quick note:  
  
The SRV version of TrendChaserFX works great on the 15-75-225 chart of the GBP/USD.  
  
I've posted the results below. It profits as much as the 30 minute chart, yet seems to take much fewer trades and doesn't wake you up at all hours of the night like you think it would being on the 15 minute time frame.  
  
With the market being in a somewhat uncertain mode Vs. the $$, I would ensure all positions are closed out by EOD.

Not a whole lot to report. System is performing nicely. I'm trading is on the DAILY charts as I've been swamped at work. So with the DAILYs I rarely have to check the charts but once or twice a day and typically wait till close.  
  
I haven't really been following the news whatsoever, which could be the reason the system has been doing so well! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f644.png?v=15.1) Don't need those silly fundamentals clouding my techie mind!  
  
Here's a screen of my current set up on the DAILYs.  
  
You can see I'm well up on the GBP/USD and have two good positions on the EUR/USD and AUD/USD. The AUD is a second entry trade. I had taken 220ish pips on that chart a couple of days ago and then got re-entered on the continuation.

Hi MuddBhudda,  
  
Thanks for replying to my post & PM; I genuinely appreciate it!  
  
Apart from the Ravi FX Fisher, I don't recognise the other indicator(s); is one TrendEnvelopes?  
  
If you could list the indicators and preferred settings for the daily TF that would be great.  
Are you entering purely on RaviFx or a combination of both indicators? And how are you calculating your stop. I think you said your TP was partly discretionary but also on a reverse signal.  
I'm looking for day system and hopefully this may be it!  
  
Thanks for your help, mate.

_"Apart from the Ravi FX Fisher, I don't recognise the other indicator(s); is one TrendEnvelopes?"  
  
_Yes, it's the TrendEnvelopes indicator. _  
  
"If you could list the indicators and preferred settings for the daily TF that would be great."  
  
_I'm using just the TrendEnvelopes and the RAVI. The deviation for the DAILY, I've set at .04.  
  
_"Are you entering purely on RaviFx or a combination of both indicators? And how are you calculating your stop"_  
  
I wait for a signal from the TrendEnvelopes and verify the signal with RAVI. RAVI should be on the south side for a TE SHORT and vice versa. My STOP is a reversal of the TE.  
  
You can take multiple positions rather than holding one position for an extended period by closing your position on a reversal and cross of the RAVI and then placing a entry order about 50 pips above/below the current price going in the direction of the TE>  
  
Fairly straightforward.  
  
Let me know if that didn't make too much sense.

hi   
do you mean you wait for a candle to close above the green trend envelop with ravi crossing above the upper line to enter a long ?  
do you find this way more profitable than the first variation?

Yes. You can see from this chart that I have the "USE ALERT" value set to 1 to signal an alarm window whenever price closes past the TE line going in either direction.   
  
The RAVI should already be going in the direction of the trade and on the side of the trade. If not, then I don't take it. That filters out the chops and spikes.....most of the time.  
  
"do you find this way more profitable than the first variation?"  
  
Well, profitability is relative to market conditions. There are times when the 30 minute or 5 minute variations are just kicking ass and pulling it in and then the pair will go through a transition and you'll loss one after another. The 5 seemed more profittable than the 30 if you adjusted to trading during the peak hours and didn't get crazy stupid. But you also need the time to sit in front of the PC and watch consistently. T  
  
The daily charts have been doing really well and I've been enjoying them. You can see three good shorts on the GBP/JPY aroundl ate July, early November, and then a brief one in mid February. The current up swing looks like a dead bounce and hopefully we will see a return to the downside as the RAVI is already there.

Yeah, that's what I have. Except on the GBP/USD, I have the deviation at .05.

The TP is subjective. I typically close on the RAVI bottoming out and then place re-entry orders about 50 pips going in the same direction.   
  
I've posted the AUD/USD showing entries and which ones lined up with the RAVI and which ones didn't. A couple could have been good trades anyway, but the pair had become vary choppy. It is what it is.  
  
The circles are trades, the squares are bad areas.

Thanks MuddBhudda; it's a great help.  
  
Would you mind showing where you exited the trades (_RAVI bottoming out_) and when you say:   
  
_RAVI bottoming out and then _place re-entry orders about 50 pips going in the same direction._  
_  
Do you mean in the opp direction to the orig trade that you exited (_bottomed out_)or in the same direction as the orig trade? Please show on the chart as it makes it a lot easier to grasp.  
  
Sorry for all the questions!  
  
Thanks,  
  
Gray.

No, the re-entry order is always in the direction of the TrendEnvelopes as they set the overall trend direction. The RAVI is just a tool to help determine entry and exit support.  
  
For the AUD chart above, my exit from the previous short was closed at .9125 and the re-entry occurred at .9075. I had a previous GBP close at 1.9632 and then re-open on a continuation of the SHORT at 1.9975 during an up spike to where we're sitting right now at 1.8961; so a little over 1,000 pips and holding.  
  
The point being, the trades are always in the direction of the TE. The RAVI is just a tool to aid your decision to open or close a position. When the RAVI spikes up and the TE is SHORT, I wait till the RAVI re-crosses the median and then consider going SHORT again if I don't see any evidence of other like currencies going against my trade. It also helps a little to know some patterns indicating continuations and reversals. It won't fool proof the system, but it does help out.

Just an update:   
  
Two more positions - EUR/JPY and GBP/JPY. If I hadn't missed the NZD, It would be a full house.   
  
All currently well in the green. GBP/JPY dropped over 200 pips last night.

Current Position Standings. Yes, I know I'm getting spanked on the NZD re-entry. Please hold the applause! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
The other pairs are still indicating a downward trend, so I'm sticking to my guns.

All positions closed based on lack of downward continuation. Sell Stops in place about 100 points from current price with the exception of the GBP/JPY which is 200.

Good to hear it freed!  
  
The GBP/USD and EUR/USD re-opened last night sometime; so maybe the down push isn't quite over yet. We'll see how they develop.

Not sure what you mean by updated, but all the indicators for the MT4 and FT SRV versions are on the website.   
  
They are also scattered here and there throughout this thread, so they can be accessed through that little paper clippy thing in the top corner.  
  
All the positions other than the AUD and NZD have re-triggered as of this morning.  
  
Not an overally exciting system to trade; down right boring for the most part. I only check it twice a day for a few minutes.   
  
The system is a straightforward trend chasing system. The only discretion or analysis needed is for exiting and re-entry strategies. Those can be fine tuned to your flavor. I use very simple methods for exiting and re-entry and they seem to work fine. **I may miss a few pips here or there or give up more than I needed to, but I'm not chained to the PC all day and still managed to pull in 1300 points in the last 30 days.**  
  
The key to not going bankrupt when you loose is to use small lots and not overleverage yourself. I know it's tempting to use larger lots and pull in the $$, but all things in their own time. Perfect your skill at exiting and entry and the $$ will eventually start coming in in larger amounts. I risk a mere fraction of my total balance and never break a sweat even if I'm 200-300 in the hole.

All positions nicely in the black this monring. I don't expect this dollar push to be as strong as the last without some greater retracement, so I'll be watching these positions closely for an indication of reversal.

Since I'm still getting a lot of emails for the indicators, I'm going to re-post them here....again.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
I'm only posting the RAVI and the TrendEnvelopes as they are the one's I'm currently using. All the others are on the website. (TrendChaserFX.com)  
  
**Three positions have re-triggered: the GBP/JPY, up VERY nicely; the GBP/USD, FLAT at BE; and the EUR/JPY, which is slightly negative**.

Here are the templates for my current set-up.  
  
I use Deviation04_TCFX.tpl for the EUR/USD and GBP/JPY.  
  
I use Deviation05_TCFX.tpl for the GBP/USD, NZD/USD, AUD/USD, and EUR/JPY.

Just FYI:  
  
All pairs but the AUD/USD have re-triggered entries and are in the black; some much more than others.  
  
The RAVI is dragging the ground quite a bit on the GBP/JPY, so I may not leave these open much longer as this is a holiday and tomorrow may bring a whole different sentiment.  
  
We'll see.

Here's the latest 30 day report from InterbankFX. 23 total trades. 19 winners. 4 losers.  
  
Still shows an even 1300 for total pips gained. Not sure if it's coincidence or what. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f615.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/2753.png?v=15.1)  
  
I don't keep track myself, so unless this number changes on the IBFX report, I'll take it as current.

Another great day for the TCFX. Thought I may have to hold some negatives given my positions this morning; but upon coming home I found that they were all wayyyyyy in the black.   
Because of the length of the EUR/JPY candle, I've closed them all and taken profit. Around 8PM I'll place re-entry levels once the pairs have calmed down some.

Just trade performance FYI. The total pips won still hasn't changed from 1300. Not sure if that's due to a lack of update from InterbankFX or what.   
  
The averages seem right on though.

Hey MudB ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) Do you trade the method exclusively on daily charts? Given that the signals arent very frequent - the interval between two signals can even be weeks.  
  
What is your opinion of using this on 1h or 4h charts?

> Hey MudB ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) Do you trade the method exclusively on daily charts? Given that the signals arent very frequent - the interval between two signals can even be weeks.  
>

> Ignored

I started using it on the 30(results on website) and have dabbled with it on the 5 and 15. I haven't really ever cared for it on the hourly or 4 hour, but it can probably be done without too much effort.  
  
Using it on the daily has required very little interaction on my part and it seems that the less I pay attention to what the market is doing throughout the day, the better my trading results are overall.   
  
Keep in mind that the signals from the TrendEnvelopes indicator are merely intermediate trend direction indications. I typically hop in and out of positions several times a week per pair; but always in the direction of the TrendEnvelopes indicator.

I use the OHLC bars and zoom way out because I like to see the big picture and not the noise in between.  
  
Your TrendEnvelopes deviation looks too tight. I'll post screenshots of the settings here momentarily; though the template should have posted the indicators correctly. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f615.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/2753.png?v=15.1)

Okay, here are the screens:

  1. Indicator List
  2. Top group of settings for TrendEnvelopes_V3
  3. Bottom group of settings for TrendEnvelopes_V3
  4. Settings for RAVI, these should be default

_NOTE THE DEVIATION OF .04 ONLY APPLIES TO GBP/JPY AND EUR/USD (BASED ON MY PERFORMANCE AND EVALUATION)_.

I should mention that I have my trading times set to:  
  
SUN : 16:00-22:00  
  
MON-FRI: 04:00-16:00  
  
That will affect the backtest results.

Hi Mudd (Anyone)?:  
  
I have been going thru this thread post by post. I appear to be th e only one totally in the the dark. It looks like "FT SRV" is some type of very powerful analysis program which relies on a live data feed.  
  
Would someone please provide a web address so as I can investigate.  
  
Thanks much

No problem.  
  
I don't actively use FibonacciTrader SRV anymore as I switched to TD Ameritrade and they have a very powerful trade station. But if you have any questions, I can probably give you a decent answer.
