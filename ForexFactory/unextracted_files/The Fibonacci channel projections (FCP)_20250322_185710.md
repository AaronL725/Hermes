A simple and elegant system graphic analysis for trading on any currency pairs and any timeframes. The FCP system is based on a graphic display of the psychology of market participants, expressed in the interaction of prices with TL, S/R, Fibonacci levels.  
  
_Advantages of FCP:_  
\- Simplicity and, subject to proper money management, reliability.  
\- The ability to adapt to your strategy.  
\- May be in addition to your trading method.  
\- Versatility - any pairs, any timeframe.  
\- Clean charts.  
  
_FCP disadvantages:_  
\- Requires some trading experience, not suitable for absolute beginners.  
\- MT4 is not the best software for graphical constructions.  
\- You can not immediately take and use.  
  

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
A few words of introduction to clarify.  
Everything that I will give here will be absolutely free. And I hope that from your side there will be no requests for private educations. I do not do it. I have enough of my trade and those small pips that I receive every day. As you know, I don’t need to prove anything to anyone. Ask everything you want to know here, let it be useful for other participants in the thread.  
  
I will not give screenshots of my account or statistics of my trade to convince you (this is my business and my private territory). If you are competent, you will understand the essence and potential of the method without this. You will need only examples of charts and deals. You will find them in my [profile](https://www.forexfactory.com/search?searchid=24806914). I will also post charts with examples of FCP here.  
  
I also have the right not to disclose absolutely everything to you, I owe nothing to anyone other than thanking those people who helped me and from whom I studied at one time. Consider me returning my moral duty.  
  
You may ask why I give you for free what brings me money... First, the money is brought not by the system itself, but by experience and knowledge. Secondly, it is not completely free. You will pay for it with your diligence, discipline and hours of training in front of your monitor. He, who is ready to make an effort, will receive the result. At its core, the FCP system is simple, but it is impossible to explain it right away (I think it’s even harmful), so be patient and you will succeed. I will explain FCP gradually and over time (or maybe very quickly) you will understand everything.  
  
In this thread we discuss only FCP. I think you know [how](https://www.forexfactory.com/userguide.php#membership-trader_coc) to behave so that everyone is comfortable and the thread is useful for its participants.  
I hope this thread will become a place of communication for fans of this system.  
  

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
The FCP system is based on a graphic display of the psychology of market participants, expressed in the interaction of prices with TL and Fibonacci levels. At the heart of FCP is the idea that the price, breaking out of a diagonal/horizontal channel or triangle, travels a distance equal to the projection of the FIBO levels on the channel width. We will start with the FIBO projection from the diagonal channel, built from the trend line, since this is the basis. In the FCP, for TL we will use the Sperandeo method (Trader Vic).  
  
On the example of uptrend.  
Find the last Highest Low (or bottom preceding the last maximum peak). Draw a beam from this point to the left. The first bottom that touches line the will be the second point. You got our trend line. Build the channel so that one of the sides coincides with the TL. Usually we get point 3 by placing a max (min) swing on the midline of the channel, but the best place for the point 3 would be a straight continuous movement as far as possible from point 1 or point 2. Measure the vertical width of the channel and build a FIBO grid equal to this width. When the price leaves the channel, place the FIBO grid so that the line 1.000 passes through the breakdown point of the TL. Lines 0.382 and 0.000 will correspond to our TP. Look for an entry after closing the signal candle at 1.000. SL is usually a few points above the level of 1.000 or extension 1.272.  
  
My daily trading consists more of scalping on m5 or m1. However, I do not recommend starting with a timeframe below 1 hour until you have mastered the system well enough.

haha, yes, I was searching hard where those Fibs retracements levels came from

could you please explain how you choose the other side of the channel, why not on the extremes mark with arrows ?

or the High between the two anchor points, which would be the 'classic' way of drawing channels.

Pay attention to this High. I placed it on the midline of the channel. This combination is of primary importance in the construction of the channel. In this case, we see a weak channel, from which we should not expect good projection, plus the Lon&NY sessions are already closed. Nevertheless, TP1 reached +35 points.

Later I will show what other important points we should consider when building a channel.  
And another example (I have tons of them ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f600.png?v=15.1), I always take a screenshot of my deals):

Hello ! Pretty interesting thread , made me remenber of Andrew Pitchfork , it graphically would be the same of using it with the fib levels on the channel it makes? the specification for the pivot points used on the AP would be the same of that of the fibo channel?

I did not study the AP in detail, but it seems to me that this is not so...  
But, you can try to build FIBO projections from a channel built using the AP.  
Maybe it will work, I do not know ...

Fresh example of FСP.  
I closed this scalp just with +30p. A good example of another rule for building a channel. If the price goes up (down) from point 1 or 2 with a single impulse and does not roll back, we place point 3 (the second side of the channel) at the place where it stops.

Im confused about how you form the channels.  
  
Could you do a step by step rule set on how to setup the channels?  
  
tnx in advance.

A very interesting method. Sometimes I really don't understand building a channel ..I would like to ask you why you don't have point three as I marked?  
Thank you. And continue your work...

The construction of the FCP channel is largely subjective. There is no clear algorithm. And I like it, there is an element of creativity. There are a few of simple rules. In fact, it is not difficult, you just need experience. You need to practice a little and you will see the channel only after seeing the chart.  
1) Place the last High (for the uptrend) or Low (for the downtrend) on the midline of the channel. In this case, the second side of the channel will be built automatically. It will not necessarily be the closest to TL High or Low.  
2) If the price rises (falls) from point 1 or 2 (TL construction points) with one impulse and does not roll back, we place point 3 (the second side of the channel) at the place where the price starts to roll back. Examples of this in my previous post.  
3) If there is no combination of High or Low with the middle line, and also no strong continuous movement from points 1 and 2, in this case, draw the second side of the channel through the point at which the price starts to roll back after rising (or dropping during downtrend) from the point 2.  
4) Ideal channel: A strong impulse from point 1 or 2 gives point 3, while the swing top is on a connecting line. Such an installation is rare, but it gives a good projection when the price exits the channel.  
5) When you built the channel, check it: the price swings inside the channel should be combined with the internal lines of the channel (25%, 50% and 75%).  
Try to carefully read what I write and carefully analyze the charts with examples, and of course you need to train. Part of my work day is testing. I'm just doing many back-tests of the FCP.

You are right, after an impulse I always draw a line through the point of its end. I wrote about this above. Otherwise, the projection may not be accurate.

Hello!  
Yes, the channel and Fibo levels you have built correctly. We need one more Fibo level 0.750-0.786. These are two lines, but we will consider it one level. In the projection we have two trigger levels, these are 1.000 and 0.750-0.786. We will enter the deal at these levels. Later I will tell you by what criteria we will determine the entrance. On the chart, I showed the ideal ratio of channel lines, price swing and Fibo projection. This is what I wrote about before. Hope this clarifies. Give it a try.

Hello.  
All right. Just need to fix some details. Show the middle line of the channel.  
Fibo level 1.000 (trigger 1) we place at the place where the candle body exits the channel.  
Raise the levels a few pips up. One more thing. To enter, I do not see a beautiful signal candle.  
You need to look at the situation in the context of higher time frames.

Hi. Thanks Seysin32 realy cool stuff.  
  
Just a short question, if dump please ignore and sorry than.  
  
  
Would it be possible to measure simple the distance of the trendlinebreak to the last high/low and take this value for TP? Measured with fibs? Without channel?  
  
  
Regards and nice WE,  
Klausi 

Stick to the plan!

In the first post, I wrote about the main idea of the FCP: after the breakdown of the channel, the price travels a distance equal to its width. How to determine its width, if you do not build a channel? After all, the outer side of the channel is not always the high/low. Also, the middle line does not always go through the high/low. Sometimes the external side of the channel (and hence its width) is determined by the size of the first swing pulse at point 2. I also wrote about this. Nevertheless, I think that it is possible to build projections using only TL and levels Fibo. But for this you will have many settings for each case of price behavior. It is much easier to draw 2 parallel lines in a few seconds and two mouse clicks.

Unfortunately, in this example, part of the channel is not shown in the screenshot. There will be many more examples ahead, don’t worry. We will disassemble everything as questions arise.

Dear Seysin32,  
  
Thank you for sharing this method. I always like to use Fibo but as price changes, i was often confused by it's application. I wish to learn from you... attached herewith GJ, did I draw it correctly?

No, not right.  
1\. Start with H1 charts. While you learn.  
2\. Where are the levels of 0.750-0.785?  
3\. Carefully read the description in previous posts on how to build TL.  
I made a model for you on my chart. Chances to reach TP 50/50. Additional signals needed.

Hello Seysin32, I like your system and I would like to apply it in the best way. I have to tell him that I understand the mechanics and how it is applied, but in order to start it, the first thing I need to know is the "channel", I explain:  
That channel, which indicator is it? or how is it built ?. I use metatrader4, does my indicator exist on my platform?  
If I could solve this problem, for me it would be easier to follow the system, because as I say I already understand the mechanics

> Hello Seysin32, I like your system and I would like to apply it in the best way. I have to tell him that I understand the mechanics and how it is applied, but in order to start it, the first thing I need to know is the "channel", I explain: That channel, which indicator is it? or how is it built ?. I use metatrader4, does my indicator exist on my platform? If I could solve this problem, for me it would be easier to follow the system, because as I say I already understand the mechanics a greeting

Hi  
For MetaTrader4 users,  
I think  
the " Fibo Channel " with modified levels,  
is the best for drawing the channel.  
  
The regular fibo channel in MT4 is not an equal distance channel.  
By changing the default setting ( as I show in the image ), we can make the equidistant channel with 5 lines ( the regular fibo channel has 6 lines ) for using in this system.  
This fibo channel does not have any relation with fibo levels , which we have to use in next step of the system.

Dear Seysin, thank you very much for working out this model, i re-learn and understand much more.  
  
I use fractal to find the bottoms and this system will help in avoiding the fake out signal. As we follow the price movement, we tends to jump into trade too early, FOMO. This system provide clear guidance & we can set standing orders, really set & forget.  
  
Please let me know if my understanding is correct.  
  
1st chart: when the price cross below the channel, we may enter sell limit at Fibo level 0.786; However, when the price move back into the channel, this signal is invalid and we got to hunt for the next setup.

2nd chart: when the price cross below the channel, our setup of standing order entry-TP is perfect! (we could use candle cross Fibo levels to extend our TP beyond 0.382). This is RR of 1:6 ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f929.png?v=15.1)!!

Thanks. You showed and explained correctly. I do not use MT4 for graphical constructions, only to open positions on one of my accounts. But, I think this is not a problem, and you showed it.

Your channel is built incorrectly, which means everything else too. Once again, re-read all my posts about FCP constructions and carefully study all the examples (so far there are not many). In the future, you can use additional indicators to confirm the entry. But we have not yet considered anything but the construction of the channel and the TL. Therefore, I strongly recommend that you and everyone here train to build a TL and a channel. Just rewind the chart six months ago and draw, draw and draw. In the next stages, we will consider what precedes the breakdown of the channel, the behavior of the price after the breakdown, the correct location of the Fibo levels, trigger levels and the opening of a position. I think I blabbed too much, no? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f600.png?v=15.1)

Friends, here is an example of FСP setups from start to finish. This is an example of ideal setups about which I wrote in this [post](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=12855580#post12855580).  
Such setups are rare, but they have a fairly high probability of a model triggering. In this example, the deal brought 90 pips or so.

Dear Seysin, thank you again & I hope you dont mind I kept asking as I'm keen to learn... I appreciate your great advice as it help me to learn more (No, i dont think you blabbed, but you patiently sharing your knowledge)...   
  
So i copy & paste your charts and instructions, trying to learn more. With the same chart of UJ H1, I hope you dont mind examine my drawing & see if I got it correct this time. Much appreciate your patience ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f604.png?v=15.1).... Cheers!

You created the TL correctly. But the channel is weak, usually I do not trade such.  
The middle line is free and the second side of the channel is also free, i.e. point 3 is missing.

Please read a few posts above, where I show on the chart the construction of the TL step by step. Here is how I would build a channel in this case. But, I have already said that I do not like him. I regard the chances of performing the Fibo projection as very low. Maximum 50/50. Maybe the price will make a correction and reach our TP. Or maybe the trend will continue. If in doubt, it is better to refrain from trading and switch to another pair. Swings inside the channel, points 1, 2, 3 must be such that they scream. I hope you understand, we must immediately see and understand them, this is what we need. If in doubt, it is better to look for another setting.

Friends, since you are asking me, let me give you advice. These are simple things and you have heard it many times, or you yourself have said it to others. Do not try to apply this to live trading now. Testing old charts. Then you can make one movement with the mouse to the left side and immediately check the correctness of your FCP setups. Price will tell you that.

Hi Seysin  
  
I saw that you mentioned a couple of times that "the channel is weak".  
Can you please explain further on this?  
Anything to do with the slope or width of the channel?

The first chart - yes. Proper setup and good projection.  
The second chart is not bad. But, if you make the TL differently, you would get a better price to enter.

A weak channel does not mean a weak trend. You need to pay attention to the swings inside the channel, the price movement at points 1 and 2, and yes, you are right, the width of the channel. That is, look at everything together. There are still important factors, but about them later.

The channel looks beautiful. But I do not see TL. Therefore, it is difficult to make a comment...

Rule for trade FCP (for live trading in the future). Build a TL. Do not build the channel, but wait for the breakdown of the TL.  
If the price makes new High/Low, rebuild the TL. If it breaks through the TL, draw a channel and check it. It's simple.  
  
Friends, tomorrow I have a weekend.  
Do not worry if I do not answer. If you have time, practice the graphical construction of the FCP.  
I wish everyone a good rest. In this difficult time, take care of yourself and your family.  
See you on Monday.

good morning,  
  
looking at the uptrend chart in ur post #1 and assuming #1 & #2 on the TL are shown on this chart.......then for the life of me I cannot see where the #3 position would be after studying your construction criteria in post #19..  
  
there appears no point of contact with the mid-channel and no single impulse from either #1 or #2.  
maybe Im getting too old..

Nice effort.  
  
The way:  
Can you please indicate points #1and #2...on that chart?  
Then we point out #3 on both upper line and mid-line.  
  
Thank you,

Hello.  
Thanks for the nice question. It's amazing that only you noticed it. You are right, I showed an atypical case. However, you will understand, it is not difficult. You are not getting old ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f600.png?v=15.1). Look at the first chart. We had TL1. Then it was canceled when the price went up a little higher. Then we drew TL2. However, we see that the price has not gone far, and kept the area that I circled in yellow.

Having received TL2, we had a choice: option number 1.

In both cases, we got our projection and TP. But these two options did not take into account that we previously had TL1, after which the area encircled by me retained its strength. Then we expand the channel so that it includes the ascending region TL1 (just to check). And we see that the price precisely interacts with the channel lines, and the maximum is exactly on the 25% line.

So, you are right. A more accurate option is option number 2. But, as I wrote earlier, there is an element of subjectivity here that allows you to see a little wider, and ultimately get more freedom in assessing the situation.

Hello Seysin32,  
  
I use MT4. Would you recommend to draw the straight lines with "Andrews pitchfork"? Just an idea.

Hello Seysin32, i'd worked out on few charts on gold and as we are doing backtesting, often we will be very much influence by the known outcome on the right of our chart. Therefore, I hope to learn forward testing with demo, trying to draw TL & Channel using your method.

Hello, my friend.  
1\. CADCHF  
The FСP model is built correctly. What should be done.   
First, remove the Fibo level of 0.893. Our trigger levels are 1.000 and 0.786-0.750.  
Secondly, look at the higher timeframes, to see if trigger prices in the past are S/R levels.  
The third. We will not open positions only on the breakdown of TL (this is another rule of the FCP). We will wait for the rollback to trigger levels and the rejection of the test. Check out the examples on the charts that I have already posted.  
2\. EURJPY  
See the chart:

Hello everyone.  
Fresh example. This is happening now. Do not pay attention to the time frame, we are only interested in the FСP model.  
In this situation, you can build a channel in two ways. And while there is no development of the situation and additional signals, we cannot say for sure which option is correct. Therefore, I built 2 options at once on two charts. The first chart - channel is built on the movement from point 2, the second chart - channel is built on the midline. Let's look at the further development of the model.

Here is and development. The first scenario turned out to be more accurate, but the second has not yet been canceled.

Seysin32, if EJ already hit 0.382, once it retrace to 0.786, will the buy potential still there?

You need to see how the price will respond to the trigger 0.750-0.786. Look at the rejection of test at this level, look at additional signals. For example, on a candlestick model. In any case, having reached TP1, we either fix part of the profit or moved SL to breakeven.

You are all right, just take your time. Today I did not talk about purchases?, all the examples from EUR/USD on M5 are examples of sales.  
If you remember, I asked not to fall below the H1 timeframe.  
Look at my chart below. Does he look up?

Do you also not want to consider the purchase situation? perhaps a little lower...? I still don't understand how you start counting and end the Fibonacci levels.

I do not mind buying. But for now, there is no FСP model for a long position. You are right, maybe a little later.

You're right. For purchase, I will wait for the test of trigger levels.

Compare the chart from [post#83](https://www.forexfactory.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=3598317&d=1586115482) and the chart below.  
If we see a test rejection, the model will work. Additional signals needed.

Yes. Wait for the hour closing. With a small SL.

Fibonacci channels are highly subjective. The trader chooses three points they deem to be significant, yet the market may not view these points as significant and thus may not respect or react as expected to the drawn levels. On the contrary, Andrew's Pitchfork lines are based on ABC patterns easier to identify and more reliable.

You are right, in the FCP is an element of subjectivity. However, not much more than in another method. The FCP has clear criteria for constructing channels and projections. However, how you apply these rules is up to you. Since you have not studied FCP in depth, you draw hasty conclusions. As I wrote earlier, this is a simple, reliable and with sufficient experience effective system. This is easy to verify. Even considering that up to this time I have described only the main elements of the FCP , without mentioning the important details.

The model worked well. Some difficulty due to the fact that the retest was already too high.  
I think it was not too late. It all depends on how many pips you are going to receive. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f604.png?v=15.1)

That's the point, it takes 3 seconds to see the pitchfork in the above image: median line starting at 2, upper and lower trigger lines at 1 and 3 (lower low).   
There is not need to study in-depth to get the same outcome. Anyway, I was only giving another option that should still work with your system.

The red line between the median line and the upper trigger is for extra confirmation.

Thanks. I see, that price responds to projection levels, is good. But your projection does not start at the channel breakdown? In that case, what are the entry criteria and where are the trigger lines? Please do the same on the EUR/USDl H1 chart like below, I just want to compare.

Ok, I tried it myself. Two main questions.  
1\. What is the width of the projection (1.000-0.000)?  
2\. Where do we place the trigger line 1.000?  
All in all, yes, I see that it works, maybe not so accurately, as FCP.  
Due to an earlier entry, there may be more triggering of the SL. Need to testing.

The trigger is the actual trigger line, first one is the black arrow but it pulls back second is the red arrow and confirm entry with red line.  
  
That's it, you don't need anything else. The fib extension based on the PF swing is only for TP

Now it is clear. It's not that simple, my friend. What will you do in most cases when the price does not test TL at all after a breakdown? The projection width by swing size is a small target. For a more accurate TP goal, it needs to be doubled. Yes, this topic has already been raised in the threads of Real Trading, in the end I was left with my own way. In this topic, more than 400 charts with examples of my live transactions based on the FCP, you can see there a good accuracy. And yet, I ask you to make a projection on the euro chart H1 in the very place to compare.

The main idea of the FCP: the width of the projection is equal to the width of the broken channel. This is a classic graphical analysis.  
If you try to use the AP - ok, but we get a completely different system. It may be easier to build, but I have not yet been convinced  
that it is works better. Therefore, we return to the Fibo projections based on the channel width.  
The question is closed.

Somehow I see some similarity with Tom Demark trend line trading.  
The difference is his is using the highest/lowest fractal to the trend line as a projection of target.

Friends, let's continue. So, the FSP itself is a graphical model. She is simple. The presence of the model itself is not a guarantee of its work. We need an "advantage" (if you don’t know what I mean, ask). Advantage depends on the method and conditions of application of the model, and it depends on the filling of the model with signals. You can use those signals (indicators of superiority) that you usually use, in which you are well versed. And this is the universality of the FCP. I will tell you what elements I use:  
1\. Candles breakdown TL.  
The candle, preceding the candle, a candle breaking TL should be the opposite. A candle breaking TL, or following, it should be accompanied by an increase in volume.

2\. Graphic models of swing, before the breakdown of TL.  
These are well-known price models; there are threads on the FF dedicated to them. I draw attention to the fact that point 3 in these models coincides with the middle line of the our channel (that is, with point No. 3 of the FCP model). If we find these models in the channel before its breakdown, it also increases our advantage.

3\. Fibo extension levels.  
If the swing maximum/minimum coincides with the extension 1.272 (or 1.618) of the Fibo grid, this also significantly increases the advantage.

These are not mandatory, but desirable conditions. The presence of these signals gives our model a great advantage in the direction of execution.  
I will write about the signals after the breakdown later.

Apart from your chart 1, can chart 2 be discretionary as below, with shorter expectation of target, and not considering the lowest fractal marked in blue?  
Thank you for your comment.

Yes.   
The price movement on chart 2 is still inside the wider price movement shown on chart 1.  
We can consider chart 2 as finding the best price to enter chart 1. This is the theory.  
But in this case, I would be aloof. I like to see a position right away and not look for it.  
IMHO.

And one more thing ... On your chart from point 2 to point 3 there is no continuous movement. Price does a small pullback.

Just a suggestion that maybe you can expound on point 3 in post 1. Point 1 and 2 would be quite easy.  
What I know now is that point 3 can be either to the right of point 1 or in between point 1 and 2.  
A better point 3 would be a straight continuous movement as far as possible from point 1 or point 2.

Between points 1 and 3, there can be bullish candles, just no pullback?  
  
Thanks for your strategy!!

Sorry, I'm not sure I understand the question correctly. From point 1 to point 3, the price can go as a single impulse without rollbacks. Or maybe do rollbacks. In this case, there are no rollbacks. I usually start to evaluate the model only after closing the candle behind the TL line.

just sharing that it is good to apply FCP in smaller time frame when price retraces to a higher time frame support zone in an up trend.

my 2 cents. the uptrend was broken and normally follows by a period of consolidation.  
it is safer to trade when price breaks out of the blue consolidation zone.

Friends, let's continue. A few words about the interaction of prices with TL. If the price breakdown through the TL and then returned back, but did not make a new maximum (minimum), we move the FIBO lines 1.000 (trigger line) to the candle whose body has broken through the channel again. In this case, we do not take into account shadows, it is the body that is important. See examples on charts:

Sorry, missed your post.  
Unfortunately, it’s no correct. Read in my first post the rules for build TL, and in the following posts where I explain of the channel and the 3rd point.  
Also pay attention to how I built the TL and the channel in the post above.

Hello, I am new to this forum, please what platform do you use the method. I see that you mentioned that MT4 is not the best software for graphical constructions.

Hello. For graphical constructions of the FСP, only 3 tools are needed: a simple line, parallel lines and Fibonacci levels. I think that this can be done in MT4. But I have been using professional software for many years, it’s more convenient for me.

Just want to encourage those who _really intend to learn_ this FCP method of trading.  
We as individuals learn at different pace due to our own trading experiences.  
These experiences nobody can help you, you have to seek your own.  
There is no short cut, unless you are willing to pay for a mentor which can be costly.  
So do not be discouraged if you don't get it the first few times.  
  
Today I've read post 1 the fourth time.  
I remember when I was a newbie I have to read a particular method 10 times.  
3 times in the morning, 3 times in the afternoon, 3 times at night.  
Then the 10th time the next day to see whether the method is suited to my style of trading.  
  
My _personal opinion_ on Highlights from post 1.  
"At the heart of FCP is the idea that the price, breaking out of a diagonal/horizontal channel or triangle, travels a distance equal to the projection of the FIBO levels on the channel width."  
  
So this is a break out method. Not just any break out.  
Use it with the main trend then this becomes a break out after a retracement.  
The target being a Fib projection based on the channel width.  
  
Hope that you can see the _big picture_ now.  
\---> Trend trading on retracement break out with entry, stop loss and target.  
What more can you ask?

Hello everyone!  
Firstly I want to thank Inthebox for a good post. Really, what more can you ask?  
Now a little theory on the example of the current situation with the EUR/USD. In fact, I did not want to talk about this until I gave a full explanation of the basics of the FCP. I think this is not a problem. After yesterday's movement, the price formed a small horizontal channel. Personally, I am not a supporter of trading inside the horizontal channel. I want to see a breakthrough in one direction or another. But this is a matter of your preference. Check out the charts below:

You may ask, why not draw simple parallel lines above the maximum? Answer: with the right scenario, the maximum probability is the achievement of TP1, the higher the lower the probability. Also, if we use Fibo lines, we get an important trigger level of 0.750-0.786. See more chart examples below:

1\. This is from post 1 with a link to post 43. In the second chart, it mentioned "Not a single shadow or body of a candle should cross the red line".  
2\. You Fibonacci Channel has 4 lines with unequal distance between them. Should have 5 lines with equal distance.  
3\. My chart for your comparison.

hi there,  
  
is it a must for point 3 to only coincide with the mid channel? or it can coincide with the last line too?  
  
also, how do you draw a perfect channel whereby point 3 coincides with the mid channel, i tried doing it with mt4 but it is not accurate...  
  
thanks

if your entry is at fib 100, then your point 1 should be adjusted to the one on the right of your point 3.  
quite some time had passed since your point 1.  
do not like your point 3 as there were many jagged retraces from your point 1 to 3.  
your FCP looks weird.  
i wonder why you did not see my posts today on that. and i posted twice.  
if the FCP is not right, so resulting the fib target is not right.

the purpose of point 3 is to measure the width of the channel, which will affect the width of fibonacci 0 to 100, which will after the target.  
  
from post 1.  
"Usually we get point 3 by placing a max (min) swing on the midline of the channel, but the best place for the _**point 3**_ would be a _**s**trai** ght continuous movement as far as possible**_ from point 1 _**or**_ point 2."  
  
i prefer point 3 drawn from point 2 from this example in my chart, in which case the other end of the channel is used.

In the image, please how did you determine the 127.2 level that is above the 0.0 level. It doesn't have the same with as the 127.2 level below the 100.0 level.   
  
Thank you.

Friends, any system is not good in itself. And FСP too. I used to write about the advantage that we must find for the model to work. But the biggest advantage is you yourself. You have to become them. If this is not the case, even the best system will bring only losses. Therefore, I do not believe in indicators, I do not believe in ideal systems or the holy grail. I believe in smart people and their experience. This is an advantage.  
If I ever hear that said me a more experienced trader, I tried to cling to every word: what he said, what it is, I want to know this. If i didn't know that, I was looking for information, I spent many hours, days, and weeks to find out and try it. Then I either kept it to myself or discarded it.   
I say banal things, but can’t say otherwise. There are only 11 pages in our thread now. If you cannot read them carefully, think and understand simple things, then trading may not be for you... I hope this is not so.

Okay, let's continue.  
So, we have a channel and a Fibo projection of its width. The fact that the price has broken the channel is not a reason to open a deal. We must look for a situation, where the price rolls back to trigger levels (1.000 or 0.750-0.768) and cannot overcome them. It may look like a pin-bar, doji Heikin-Ashi, candelstick model, failure swing pattern (by Tom Dante) or any reversal signal that you use in your trading system. I always wait for a signal at trigger levels and if it is not there, I will not take a deal, even if the price then rises or falls. What else does it give? Small SL and opening at a good price. On most of my charts here you will see signals to enter at trigger levels. Do not rush if the candle touches the trigger line, wait for the next candle, it is a signal candle for entry. Below are a few "bad" charts. You see that entering too early without a signal candle would be a mistake.

Hi All,  
This is for anyone who is using MT4 and wants to get the Fibo Channel tool settings right.  
  
1\. Draw out the Fibo Channel tool on your chat.  
2\. Go to the properties of the Fibo Channel tool and use the parameters below...

  1. Common : Change the Style setting to a colour that fits your background (I use Red)
  2. Fibo Levels : Use levels -0.25, -0.5,-0.75. Change the style color as needed (I use Blue) and I use the dashed line.

That is all that is need to use the tool in MT4. Hope it is useful for someone.  
Thanks.

Very clever adjusting. ( Choosing of the Fibo levels. )

i think your post appeared late as you are a new member.  
your answer here [https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...3#post12871703](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=12871703#post12871703)  
  
hmm ... first time i encounter where the 2nd point 3 is higher than the 1st point 3.  
maybe Seysin can answer.  
not so sure. a bit discretionary. the difference is not much.  
personally i prefer to see the latest point 3 to be lower than the previous peaks. this is to show that the momentum going up is slowing, in which case point 1 has to be shifted to the right

Hi, im trying to understand the system and youve explained it very well. I have 1 question, you show multiple TP levels in your graphs, but only 1 entry level. What does that mean? Do you not close the whole trade once it reaches tp level or do you have multiple positions open (if so at what fib levels do you open them?)  
  
Thanks!

What if the pullback only touching the FIb channel and only by its wick not the whole body passing the channel, will it consider also need redraw the channel or only require rearrange the Fibo retracement start from the wick that touching the channel? look at message 175 the Video Seysin uploaded, i think just need to move the fibo

Hello.  
I open a deal at the trigger level 1 or 2 (1.000 or 0.750-0.786).  
When the price reaches TP1 (0.382), I close part of the position, usually 1/3, and move SL to the BE for the rest part.  
When the price reaches TP2, I close one more part, and allow the rest to grow. If I opened at trigger level 1, and then get another signal at trigger 2, I can add.  
I prefer to take profits and decline losses, I feel so comfortable, but you can do otherwise. It all depends on what timeframe you are working on and what profit will satisfy you. If on H1 and above, you can increase the position gradually.

Hello and welcome.  
Not bad FСP. It's simple - look for signals at trigger levels. Add to this an analysis of a higher timeframe or other signals from your system.   
For example, as on my chart below. To improve, train more to find FСP on old charts.

In fact, I did not want to talk about this until I gave a full explanation of the basics of the FCP. I think this is not a problem. After yesterday's movement, the price formed a small horizontal channel. Personally, I am not a supporter of trading inside the horizontal channel. I want to see a breakthrough in one direction or another. But this is a matter of your preference....

depending on situation and to be seen in the whole context.  
in the video:  
1\. at 0.20 the wick touched the channel and point 1 was shifted to the right.  
2\. later on point 1 was not moved.  
3\. compare the passage of time. 1 above price moved up for more than a day before coming into contact with channel, whereas 2 above hours passed.

Hi @Seysin32, Thank you for your sharing.   
  
I understand that this system does not use any indicators but just out of curiosity for the chart that you have shown me; may I know what is the indicator at the bottom of your chart and what settings please.

Can you tell me if i drew this correctly? it seemed that the entry level is at 625, but after going below the breakdown it went back up. Is there an error in my channel ?

All the same, only for a horizontal channel. A - channel width, B - projection width. Here is today's gold example.

be careful if price does not come down, h4 becomes a pin bar.

Hi @Inthebox, is it a double-top for readings between the start of April to date?

so the expected happened.  
the trade gave 25 pips gain before price went up.  
i am still in the trade.  
i do not use hard stop loss. use it only when i am asleep.  
i only exit a trade by looking at the candle at a resistance level.  
this is a personal preference.

hi @Seysin32,  
  
I have made another take on eurusd hourly chart. If I have drawn the chart correctly, it looks like a good SELL entry if there is a price signal at 0.786-0.750 range. What is your opinion? Thanks in advance.

Hi @Seysin32,  
  
Thank you for your guidance. I am trying to figure out what has gone wrong with my charting. Is it because of the new low (Point 3)?

Hi @Inthebox,  
  
Thanks for sharing as well. In addition, I am thinking point 3 might due to the use of Sperandeo method to draw trend lines. Perhaps @Seysin32 could guide us further.

The Sperandeo method means that after price had broken the FCP channel, it retraces back to fib 100 or 75/78.6 for entry.

The rules for constructing a TL, channel and choosing point 3 are quite simple. Follow them and the price will "respect" the lines of your projection with amazing accuracy. However, as with everything else, practice is needed. Trainings more on the old charts, you can always check your FСP and see where you made a mistake.  
Important note. Always consider your FСP model in the context of other information - other signals, S/R levels on higher timeframes, etc. The only way. In this case, you will not have confusion in your head. If you are working on the m5 chart, open the H1 chart, see if there is a model of the FCP there? What will you do - look for a Buy or Sell? When everything is clear, go back to m5 and build the FCP model in the right direction. For example, some time ago I published a deal in which I was looking for an entry point for H1 at the levels TP1/TP2 m5.

the fcp mid line should be touching your circled point 3.  
you are encouraged to use higher time frame when assessing lower time frame entry.  
the downward sloping trend line in h1 would have indicated that buying is not ready yet.

Thanks  
You are totally right.  
  
But ( as an experiment ) I try to choose the wide of the channel such that the fibo level 1.272 mach to some important point in my chart.

pardon me if i am too long winded but i want you to get it right.  
i don't mean your fibo, i mean your channel.  
if your channel is not right, it follows your fibo is not right.  
the blue arrow (middle line of channel) should be touching the blue square box.

So friends, let's continue.  
This is the final part of the description of the FCP model, which does not prevent you from improving it in the future. I spoke earlier about the elements (additional signals) that create an advantage in our model towards its success. Two more such elements that are MA and MACD. With MACD, everything is simple. I am looking for divergences or hidden divergences at the maximum/minimum inside the channel, or on the trigger lines. For MA - I’m looking for the intersection of two lines, and if it is on the trigger line, this is ideal. Also, the MA lines for me are the final argument in deciding to open a deal. The rule: is to always look for a deal in the direction from the pink dashed line MA to the yellow dashed line MA. Even if you have the perfect channel and projection, if the MA lines are not crossed in the direction of the deal, the price may go against you. Below are some examples with explanations and settings for MA + MACD.

Note. MA settings may vary depending on the pair. Set up and see how price interacted with lines in the past.

this is quite common.  
impulse wave broke yesterday's low and now in consolidation.  
quite obvious that trend is down.

the zone around your channel point 2 is a support zone.

au. if your point 3 is at outer fcp, then the point 2 to point 3 is jagged - should be smooth as far as possible.  
if your point 3 is after point 1, use fcp mid line.  
if your point 3 is before point 1, use fcp outer line.  
general guide only. all depends on how wide you want your fcp which will affect your fib targets.  
compare ....  
  
uc. tp1 and 2 achieved with horizontal fcp.  
price broke out of consolidation with lower high lower low, so no buying.  
multiple opportunities to sell at fib 100.  
even if want to buy, still can achieve tp1 profit with smaller time frame.  
knowing that one is trading counter trend.

I think the number of visits to the FF has really increased lately. But everything works fine for me.

Hello Seysin.  
Nice thread you have opened here. Basically just price action and psychology. I have only read half the pages and I'm trying to learn how to draw the correct lines. Does this one make sense? 1st target has been reached and stop would be at b/e by now. I did take that trade live (on demo) but after that strong retracement, I decided to get out with a few pips, also because I didn't want to leave it open overnight. Big mistake! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f600.png?v=15.1) I suppose patience is the key...

> Hello Seysin. Nice thread you have opened here. Basically just price action and psychology. I have only read half the pages and I'm trying to learn how to draw the correct lines. Does this one make sense? 1st target has been reached and stop would be at b/e by now. I did take that trade live (on demo) but after that strong retracement, I decided to get out with a few pips, also because I didn't want to leave it open overnight. Big mistake! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f600.png?v=15.1) I suppose patience is the key... {image}

I built the FCP on the GBP/JPY for comparison. Keep in mind that the price has already worked out the basic levels of projection.

Waiting for this to develop (m5 just for learning purpose). I have readjusted the fib after breakout and reentry of the channel. I see higher support there. Any suggestion?

It didn't exactly touch on my chart so I had a late entry, but more than that, I was waiting for a confirmation candle. Is that wrong? Basically my entry was on 0.75

no right or wrong for entry.  
if your style is waiting for confirmation candle, then do what is comfortable.

it's not that i am accurate. the target maybe.  
the truth is that i divided my intended lots by 3 sometimes 5 entries.

Guys, I missed this one. I had set up my order at the 1 level but it didn't retrace far enough. I'm still a bit confused about entries. Maybe on 5min it requires quicker entries? Or probably if the momentum is strong it would be worth to anticipate at the 0.78?

careful. there may be a bounce after break out of trend line.  
look at higher time frame first to see big picture.  
for small time frame, you may want to divide your intended lots by 2 entries.  
one at break out, one at retrace.

That's right. To enter, we must have signals at trigger levels. Breakdown of TL can be false. And of course, the context of higher timeframes. We have already talked about this. Be careful.

Well TP2 has been reached already.  
What about this other one? But I used point 2 as the outer line of the channel. Was this mentioned or did dream about it?

Assuming my theory about point 2 is right (and I would be glad if I got confirmation please), can you tell me if I could have entered at some point on that bar marked by the arrow? Maybe looking at a lower TF?

sorry for flooding the thread. Just seeing setups everywhere, hopefully agreeing with rules and higher TFs. Opinions about this? It broke out my channel and then reentered inside, to then break out again

Yes, they could, since the price crossed the TL many times, but did not make a new maximum. But I would not take such a model. I love beautiful setups. And if I don’t see it, I’m not looking for it on purpose. Look a little wider on my chart.

Here is one example of bad trade but i can't figure it out what went wrong, when the price pullback from the 0.786 area its simply goes straight to my SL hahaha.  
  
Maybe this thread keen eyes could spot the problem i've made on this trade?  
  
everythings seem in place, the MA crossing, the bearish hidden divergen, the higher time trend (H4)  
  
  
nb: I've been made quite some pips using Seysin method using fibo bring in this thread, thank you very much for sharing this method. i'm form Indonesia btw.Inthebox...also thanks for actively contributing on this thread, learn a lot from you also

if these were traded in smaller time frame, none would survived.  
  
after the higher time frame regular divergence, price could not break up the strong resistance.  
then the support broken. what's next? retrace and continuation.

this is not in line with the method shown in this thread.  
in fact it is opposite.  
this is a break out method, whereas you are using the rejection/bounce method.  
you would not have post if you have read post 1.

I see you wrote the same thing in different threads. Sorry buddy, but this has nothing to do with the FCP.

Hello.  
Your first channel is built incorrectly, therefore, there is no accuracy in the projection.  
Look at the chart:

No problem, buddy. You can open a new thread dedicated to your method of build channels, etc. Then you can post your videos there.   
Here we are talking only about the FCP.

Nicely said.  
  
This system is absolutely brilliant . I love it , Thanks for sharing![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f970.png?v=15.1)

All right, buddy. I do not in any case did not want to interject into your thread just thought maybe it would be interesting for everyone to learn something new t system very, very similar and then to intensify the efforts to enter the trade. But if the conversation is only about FCP then OK

ok but the biggest issue i have now is that some trades end up hitting the SL because it breaks the TL, I enter, and then it goes back towards the SL and hits it  
  
how do we filter out false breakouts of the TL??

what time frame do you trade?  
smaller time frames you find more set ups and SL will be hit more often.  
experiment yourself.  
if you like trading in smaller time frame, not necessarily to use fib 127.2 as SL.  
use the previous one fractal away or two away. experiment.  
if you find SL has been hit often but later price end up going in the original direction, you can even consider the other end of the channel.  
that is, provided you got the higher time frame trend right.  
or else try m30 and above.

Hello. You have provided too little information to give you an answer. Try to publish the chart, it will be more informative. I hope while you train on a demo account.  
And one more thing ... you read the post 205, and did not find the answer in it?

this is for those who like the 'excitement' of trading in lower time frames.  
hopefully it will mitigate the losses.  
start looking for the fcp channel after the vertical dotted line, only when you see a lower high and lower low.

So friends. Since the questions from the participants are repeated the same, let me repeat the answers to them.  
First of all. Take the time to carefully study the information from [post#1](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=990237).  
What are the findings to get started?  
1\. If you are new to trading, FСP is not for you yet. Do not think that just by reading the description of the method, you will immediately become a successful trader. Learn the basics: market structure and participants, supply and demand, price action, S/R levels, candles, etc. Only then FСP.  
2\. Start mastering the FСP by testing on old charts. It will not cost you anything. But it will give a lot. Believe me. This is a good training. You can always see your mistakes right away, just by moving the chart to the left. Over time, you will see the projection only by looking at the chart. Having sufficient experience in the FCP, I devote a lot of free time to testing on old charts. I like it.  
If you started.  
1\. If we built the model correctly, the price will “respect” the lines of projection with amazing accuracy. It starts with trigger levels. If this does not happen, I know that I built the model incorrectly. And then I'm looking for an mistake in the TL or in the channel. If the model is controversial, or I doubt it, I am looking for opportunities on other pairs. Good setups are visible right away.  
2\. If you look at all successful FCP models in retrospect, you will see, that signal candles did not break much trigger levels. This means that SL can be very small. In this case, if you make a mistake three times, you will lose a little, but for the fourth time you will recover the losses and also earn more.  
What else to say... I do not know. He who has eyes, let him see.  
I am grateful to all the participants who bring useful points to the strategy of using the FCP, while preserving the model itself.  
I wish everyone to enjoy your trading. Take care of yourself and loved ones.

Hi @Seysin32  
  
Just found your thread and going through all the posts. I love this method. I used to trade a 2 channel intersect (4H and 1H) a while back.  
  
Looking for setups on M5 just for practise.  
Can you let me know if I've drawn this correct? This is a GJ M5 chart  
  
Also another question in how to draw your channels (bullish/bearish). Coz sometimes the Daily/H4 may give you one direction and the ltf may be showing another.  
  
Thanks again, and look forward to seeing good results from your method.  
Cheers

thanks @Seysin32. I have gone through your Gold analysis and it makes sense.  
  
For my charts (GJ), the issue i'm having is that I see it's bearish on the htf (eg D/H4 etc).  
  
So even though I've drawn a bearish channel (expecting a bullish trade), that would be counter-trend trading and a little risky imo.  
  
That's why I drew the recent bullish channel (for the Short trade) so I can follow the trend.  
  
1) When you say the channel is not needed, I'm a bit confused. What if I hadn't drawn the bearish channel (that you said is "ok")?  
Would the other channel be valid then?  
  
2) Currently on GJ M5 I'm in a SHORT (but you said channel is not needed, so does this mean it's a bad trade?  
  
  
3) Please help me clear the confusion:  
What is the 1st step? Do we look at the D/H4 to get the overall direction and then draw the appropriate channel on lft that will align with that htf direction?  
  
I'm sorry if I'm not making myself clear. I hope you understand what I'm trying to say, and where I'm getting 'stuck'.  
  
Again, many thanks for your help.

Serqew, nice trade. What oscillator are you using?

Imagine that the price moves inside the channel at htf. We have three options.  
1\. We are waiting for a pullback and enter in the direction of the trend. We are looking for the exact entry point at ltf, having built the FСP there.  
And, as you know, you can trade the pullback itself too. I gave an example in a previous post (oil chart).  
2\. Expect breakdown of high/low. We considered ([example](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=12869423#post12869423)1, [2](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=12873702#post12873702)) the option of constructing this model in a thread.  
3\. Do nothing, but just wait for the price to exit the channel. As soon as the price has left the channel and we have received confirmation of this,  
we are looking for a place to enter at the best price.  
In your case:  
If the price exited the channel up (against the trend), the projection would show you where you can enter in the direction of the trend - at TP1 and TP2,  
the impulse usually weakens (example [here](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=12867648#post12867648)).  
PS. Do not forget that today is Friday.

thank you very much for your reply.  
makes sense.  
  
I will continue to practise. It truly does look to be a very profitable system if properly implemented.  
If I may ask, how long have you been trading this method?  
  
Thanks again and have a lovely weekend! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Hi Seysin,   
  
Thanks for sharing this strategy to us. Will practice this one.   
  
By the way, were you guys able to check on GBPCAD 1 hour? I see a breakout of the channel and a sell setup.

Opinions on this one please? I used point 3 for the outer line again  
EDIT: 5 pips in profit while typing but I realise it was kind of an extended move from the bottom of the channel. Probably a retracement to be expected?

Where do we really place point 3 on Fib Channel? Is it on the median line or on the outer line? I have it on median line. Is this right?   
  
Thanks.

after price broke down the h4 trend line, it is finding hard to break up the trend line and resistance zone.

Please try to publish charts only with FСP.  
I have no doubt that your system is very good, but it is something else.  
And one more thing - if you quote a replica of a thread’s participant, do it in the original language.  
I hope for your understanding, as well as that you won’t have to repeat this for the third time.  
Thanks.

Seysin, can you kindly enlighten me on this. I saw the post of InTheBox - post 133, but is point 3 always on the outer line? When do we place it in median line?   
  
Thanks.

Well Seysin I have already noticed that You do not like the opinion of other participants this is Your right and your chat But in Your channel constructions there is one common mistake that 90% of traders make so your channels are built differently and people in the chat ask so many questions about this it's a Pity that they did not want to listen to me but it's always the case that when there is an opportunity to approach perfection there are always barriers good Luck to Everyone and profit!!!

Nobody bothers you to save 90% of traders from this common mistake by creating your own thread.  
Thanks for your kind wishes. Good luck to you too.

> Ignored

Point 3 is placed on the outer side of the channel, if from point 1 or 2 (or from 1 and 2 together) there is an impulsive price movement without rollbacks. It is desirable candles with a large body (relative to other candles). Preference to the impulse from point 1. In other cases, point 3 is on the midline. It is not complicated, and there is also an easy way to check. I always check the channel looking at how the price reacts to trigger levels. If price does not pay attention them, then I rebuild the channel (put 3 points in another place). The ideal option is described in [post#23](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=12855580#post12855580).  
  
Here is a case that is not common: There is no momentum from point 1 or 2, the swing max/min is so small that if we place it on the middle line, we get a channel with a width of pencil. Place point 3 on the 25% line of the channel. If the external side of the channel (before or in the area of point 2) and the price go in different directions, decrease or increase the channel so that they are directed in the same direction.  
The problem for many beginners (I do not mean anyone here specifically) is that they do not want to think and evaluate the situation in context. To consider a combination of factors. They want a mechanism that works itself, always and accurately, like a robot. I remember a case when fake news appeared on Google and robots trading in the news caused huge losses ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f602.png?v=15.1)  
  
As I said before, the element of subjectivity is not in the interpretation of principles, but in their application. The conviction of sellers and buyers, fear or greed, all this is also subjectivity. Subjectivity drives markets. I think it's great. This is a creative opportunity that is rewarded with money. I get pleasure from it.  
Below are a few examples of what I said and a video to improve your mood ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Thanks so much Seysin.  
Have been following this thread since day one.   
Still trying to "learn to see" when I look at the completed examples posted, it seems so obvious.But then when I look at a "blank" chart by myself, it is not so obvious.  
These videos allow me to "learn to see" what you see!!

Keep the indicator draw the trend according to the method Sperandeo. I think it will be useful for many to start then learn to draw yourself

I think the channel is not correct.  
Due to the following note from post #1.

i guess it's alright with point 3 at fcp mid line after point 1.  
  
but i would like to ask seysin comparing the 2 charts which one he prefers.  
the notion is from [post 14](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=12852864#post12852864). point 3 at fcp outer line after point 1.  
my reasons are:  
1\. point 3 is the lowest low.  
2\. there are 2 price touches reactions at the fcp quartile line.

Same as what I have. Your candle color though may confuse you later. Should be green for bullish, red for bearish. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f62c.png?v=15.1)

Hello, friends!  
This is just my opinion, you should work yours head.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f604.png?v=15.1)  
1\. Context.   
Where are we. You see on chart#1 that we are inside a big movement "А". Аll subsequent swings are decreasing. This means that channel projections are also decreasing. Conclusion - we make small projections with small TP. Before the price breaks the figure, it can go out and come back. Until the figure is broken and we receive confirmation of this, be careful.  
2\. The build of the channel.   
So, we have 2 options for the 3rd point. Why do I choose chart#2:  
a) On chart#4 (the 3rd point on the midline) we see, that the price ignore trigger line#2. On chart#3 (the 3rd point is on the outer side of the channel) we see, how the price reacts to trigger#2 (and to other projection lines quite accurately). Also, as Inthebox said, in this case, the price takes into consideration the internal lines of the channel.  
b) Continuous movement from point 2 is interrupted by a small rollback. This is not critical and in another case we can ignore it, but here it is in favor of chart#2. And as we can see, this also coincides with the outer side of the channel.  
3\. Action plan.   
Considering what was said in paragraph 1, and the fact that we have a narrow channel with a small projection. It’s also that MA lines diverge and while we are on the sales side. In the case of receiving a long setup on m5, I will enter with a small SL and with TP in the area of the upper MA line.  
4\. I am not a supporter of catching turns at the most extreme point. I will enter later, when I see confirmation. In doing so, I will earn less. But, I don’t need much, even 15-20 points will be enough for me. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f642.png?v=15.1)

Hello Isabella and welcome!  
I am not sure that I have the right quotes, my candles look different. However, I would build the channel and projection as on my chart. You need to wait for the development of the model and confirmation signals. If your trading style allows, go down to H4 or H1, there are more trading opportunities for training in FСP.

A pleasant tone that you maintain here @Seysin.  
On monday / tuesday i will have time to try out current market time frames as you suggested. I prefer M30-W1, so a actually search should be worthwhile in the next week. Let's see if I can do the technical craft in the chart.  
  
Your channels have 5 lines. Would you also accept 3 lines, especially in higher tf? Or does this view destroy your concept.

[quote = Inthebox; 12885491] {quote}我想第3点在第1点之后的fcp中线就可以了，但是我想问seysin比较他喜欢的2张图表。这个想法来自第[14篇](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=12852864#post12852864)。点1之后的fcp外线的点3。我的原因是：1.点3是最低的最低点。2.在fcp四分位数线上有2个价格触动反应。{image} [/ quote]

Everything is fine. I think, that maybe 3 lines. The midline and channel width are important. You may try. I am not a big specialist in htf. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f642.png?v=15.1)

I am a newb so I may have missed something, although I have been doing my studies as instructed.  
  
When I look at the EURUSD 1hr chart and 30 min chart, I see multiple trades setting up, day after day.  
  
I have attached a file (another new task) with my chart. Can you give me any feedback?  
  
Thanks

if you use m30 as your main chart, also look at 2 time frames above and below it to get better informed.  
the 1st fcp on the left was too steep, m15 provided more information.  
your fib 100 was placed wrongly.  
compare.

I have a subjective point 3 on GBPJPY - 5min chart.  
  
You think the retest of price on 1.000 could've been the best entry point?   
  
Thanks.

I always try to take rollbacks to the trigger line, when a signal candle appears. But this does not always happen ...  
We can see the FCP setups on many charts, but I like to take only beautiful ones.

may not be able to retest fib 1 as momentum was strong.  
advance stopped by london open high.  
however day open is also a support area.

**Inthebox** , thank you for your critique. That final fib 100 **was** placed incorrectly. It seems to have gotten moved during my chart cleanup for presentation.  
  
In reviewing your comments, I saw that the very first channel on my chart was too wide. By changing the channel boundaries, using the lower time frames, as you suggested, I was able to create a little more opportunity for acting on the first FCP.  
  
The Eur/Usd chart was originally presented by**Chrisjia** in a request for review.  
  
Thanks to **Seysin32** for commitment, time and patience, as well.  
  
I look forward to all of your posts.

Yes, the channel was correct. But I would consider the projection as finding a place for a short position for H1.

Sensei Seysin32,  
  
Your USD/CAD trade post was very helpful. While examining it, I saw a different trade to analyze within the chart.  
  
This trade starts on Friday 4/17 at 4am with a sharp decline that lasts through the rest of the trading day. I have drawn a simple channel to show the setup. The market closes just as the price crosses the TL. On Sunday , The price crosses Fib 100 signalling a long entry.  
  
Is my analysis accurate?

for comparison.  
the time could be shortened for set up.  
  
since the original opportunity to enter a trade was missed at the h4 fib 100/75 area:  
i could wait for:  
1\. h4 retracement to fib 100/75, or  
2\. look for a h1 set up

Hello!  
Perhaps this is correct. I am not sure about this situation, my quotes are slightly different. That's what I think. On H1, a small channel, inside weak swings, looks so-so... To clarify the situation and get a better place to enter, we go down to m5 (we only need trigger line 1 and 2). On m5, everything is much better, and you see a good setup for entering. I showed on the chart.

To clarify the situation and get a better place to enter, we go down to m5 (we only need trigger line 1 and 2). On m5, everything is much better, and you see a good setup for entering. I showed on the chart. {image}

Instruction understood. My apologies for the data format. That was a TOS equity chart and it does not present the same data. I will change to a more readable format soon.  
  
My focus has been on the H1 with point 3 on the channel. I'll reread post 1 and the linked posts and dive in deeper.  
  
Thank you for sharing your idea and your time.

1\. built incorrectly ...  
2\. while there is no FСP model, development of situation and then confirming signals are needed.

Thank you for your reply. Can you show an error on the indicator? So that I can correct it.

Unfortunately I can’t, my platform does not support third-party indicators. Just compare the charts.  
I think that it is impossible to create an indicator for the FСP. But it is possible for some of its elements. Maybe I'm wrong...  
Why not learn and use the simple rules for constructing channels, it's easy. It’s much harder to create indicators ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f642.png?v=15.1)

Thank you for the rapid response.  
And proves you have built this skill to be able to do it when half-asleep !  
  
It makes sense now that I was so focused on confirmation of my original TL that I missed the creation of a different point 1, and a whole new TL!  
So simple, but like a good golf swing....practice, practice, practice.....but only practice with a good coach, otherwise you develop bad habits.  
  
Thanks for the answers and for starting and coaching this thread!

Hi Seysin and In the Box,  
  
could you show me what mistake i've made for this trade? indeed no divergen, the channel seems perfect as in intercept the mid channel after point 1 and bottom channel right on the bottom price in the channel.

Did you enter the trade after the pullback to 100? or right away during the break out?

Hi Seysin,  
  
did you really wait for the MA crossing separated visually to enter the trade? because on this trade seem you could directly enter on the 100 level of the fibo?

i have my intended trade unit divided by 3 so that one can be at break out, one on pullback, the third one as i see fit.  
this is my own preference. the first one is like a scout out to test, the rests when the movement becomes clearer.

Hi Kvak,  
  
if i see your gold trade, if we entered during the first 3 candles after breakout, we will lost the trade and hit the SL, while on those 3 first candles seems like the bottom wick clearly showing the rejection around that area.  
  
how do you think, we can pass those 3 first candles and wait? should we always in this case, wait until it reach again the trigger 0.782 area?  
  
any thought?

nice MM then, so we could manage lesser loss when the price against our prediction.  
  
could you comment on my trade? is it due to no confirmation of the candle to entry?

the main thing i would advise is do not trade usd vs cad in asia session.  
trade jpy or aud or nzd (asian currencies) vs eur or gbp or maybe usd.  
so i expect less movement and therefore would lessen the width of fcp channel.

Hi my morning view for gold was looking for sell I have pending order....   
I will disappoint you, no magic. Lucky buy. I don't have much time, I'am babyssiting my kids, they have a closed school..... I had time for a while, I looked at other timeframes and it was only after those red candles. I painted the channel and then go to buy. Really lucky ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

I very rarely enter without the 1.000 test. I do this in the case, when the price crosses the TL many times back and forth, but does not make a new min/max.   
In this example I did not enter at trigger1. So as soon as the price touched trigger 2, I entered, by this time the MA lines crossed.  
Chart below:  
Three candles closed under Trigger line1. There is no signal candle. You can’t enter.

Its ok, i just wondering how you can escape those 3 candles, before you get the bullish move. If it just a luck and it is your day then. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

Thanks Seysin,  
  
noted:  
rarely enter the 1.000 (at first I bet) because it is too risky the price might trying to break the channel, and more of it if it try touching multiple time to break the channel.  
Of course after sometime when it pullback again to 1.000 it might be better to enter as long as we have the trigger candle  
  
Thanks for your insight.  
  
the trigger candle you mean here usually a pinbar, double top/bottom, or bullish/bearish engulfing?

Hi Seysin,  
  
this trade interest me,  
  
what is triggering you to enter here, as it have not a pullback to the trigger line? solely due to the bullish candle of it that pierce right to the 0.782 area?

You are right, I more often enter from Trigger 2 (zone 0.75-0.786), than Trigger 1. If it is not a scalp, but a deal on Н1 and higher, on Trigger 1 I open only part of the position, on Trigger 2 one more part (approximately, like Inthebox does).

I mentioned that I entered on m5, and I took the target from H1. Look at the chart m5, there everything is the same what we are talking about****:

Seysin,   
  
Do you always wait for the candle close of the price rollback/retest to 1.000 line and/or to 0.786/0.750 line?   
  
I have GBPNZD and GBPUSD on 15 Minute. Can you kindly check if these rollback/retest are good entry point?   
  
Thank you.

On both charts, everything is correct. I always wait for the candle to close, it is desirable that the candle touches the level or slightly breaks through it, and then closes in the opposite direction (or next candle).

Thanks, Seysin.  
  
Now it's clear.  
  
I checked this EURUSD 5 Minute and saw this retest on 1.000 line. The entry point will be at the close of this candle, right?

How do you base where you place the 0 and 100 fib levels?

I think, drawing a channel is not the first thing, you need a Trendline first, when price breaks the line, the you create your channel.   
  
I advice you go read post 1. 

Begin with the end in mind

compare the h1 chart.  
if you are using retracement for entry, go to m5 at the point of yellow dotted vertical line.  
in m5 you use the same fcp method to refine your entry.  
so your fcp has to be downward sloping, not an upward one.

In all honesty, this is a load of hogwash. You are trading a trend line break using fibonacci to manage your money, it's not a strategy, it's a money management system.

i assumed that you have read post 1 because this is the least basic thing to do before you start to make a comment in a thread.  
  
from post 1.  
"The FCP system is based on a graphic display of the psychology of market participants, expressed in the interaction of prices with **_TL_ **and Fibonacci levels. At the heart of FCP is the idea that the price, _**breaking out**_ of a diagonal/horizontal channel or triangle, travels a distance equal to the projection of the FIBO levels on the channel width. We will start with the FIBO projection from the diagonal channel, built from the **_trend line_** , since _**this is the basis**_."  
  
you mean the above mention of using trend line is not clear enough in post 1?  
  
using trend line break in higher time frame and upon retracement, using trend line break again in lower time frame is not a strategy by itself?

so now you have come to agree that  
1\. mention of trend line break is very clear in post 1.  
2\. trend line break in both higher and lower time frame is by itself a strategy.  
  
therefore going forward, kindly refrain from using such strong wordings as "a load of hogwash".

while waiting for seysin to answer, a few comments.  
the idea is there.  
both of your entries made some profit.  
however work on the overall structure and know the limits of targets.  
see the support and resistance limitations.

Good. You yourself see, when the price accurately confirms the correctness of the projection.

great, thank you. I used M5 for the trigger but a different method.. this is also what is great about your method, as you said, it can be integrated to other system very nicely.  
Cheers bud.

Got it. Thanks! I also use your indicator sometimes. It also helps me to catch some pips too ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1). Didn't realize the RD... A lesson.. haha

The width is not that far because of the continuous movement has formed in point 1 to Line 5, right?  
Therefore, it is a profitable FCP action except for my wrong placing of channel.

It's me again.   
Actually, I notice that the TL can be drawn for more than one opportunity in the same chart.  
Chart 1 is what I am in now.  
Chart 2 is what I find another opportunity in the same chart.  
Can I say that if the FCP is created correctly, then normally I can just focus on this FCP and ignore the other possible FCP?

i noticed that you are using h1.  
do not force to draw fcp, it has to jump out quite clearly.  
you intend to buy because the trend tells you so.  
but h1 fcp does not jump out.  
you will miss out a lot of things if you do not go down to lower time frame.  
go down to m5/15 for more details to look for traces for an entry.  
  
1\. fcp jumps out in m15.  
2\. regular divergence in m15  
3\. higher high higher low in m5.  
  
so chart 2 is better.

You must have misunderstood. I don't think trendlines are reliable, let alone a strategy by themselves.

As you can see, on your 2 chart you get a more accurate entry at the best price.

i understand.  
it's a matter of opinion. nothing more nothing less.  
it's only your personal experience that your own method of application of trend lines failed you previously, leading you to form the opinion that trend lines are unreliable.  
however, it's otherwise for me, strategy using trend lines as part of the arsenal is a successful one.  
  
with due respect to seysin, my conversation with you ends here as we agree to disagree on this subject matter.

Hello, friend.  
1\. The channel is built incorrectly (description and examples in post 1).  
2\. See chart H1 with my comments.  
3\. See chart m15 with channel build and projection.  
3\. Check the m5 chart with the entry point and goals.

my explanation if i may add, is that your sell is a counter trend to higher time frame.  
for counter trend is more risky, the fcp width has to be adjusted smaller.  
however it is better to trade with the higher time frame trend  
the h1 (with explanation) fcp and m15 fcp are shown with buy at yellow arrow onward.  
trading smaller time frame by itself alone has not enough information to see the whole picture in context.

Hi Seysin,  
  
if this trade made by me, i will enter the trade much faster than you either during the pullback to 1.000 or after reaching 0.786 after pulling back to 1.000, i dunno what make you patiently wait that small pinbar that retrace to 0.786 line? i would think that train is long gone after its leaving the 0.786 ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)

Dear Seysin an InTheBox,  
  
when we make the channel after a breakout, when the price than after few candles, pullback to the channel with some of the candle body I know that mean the channel is cancelled. What about the candle wick that entering back to the channel, should we simply reposition the Fibo line only or this is also cancelling the channel?

1.000 is a very weak level until it is confirmed. But often, when a signal candle appears, the price is already leaving too far from 1.000.  
Then I wait for a pullback to 0.786-0.750 and enter there. This is more reliable.

i think it's better you show a chart on this.  
sometimes when candle enter back to fcp, especially for short period of time, it does not mean that fcp need to be adjusted.  
the original and adjusted fcp can be compared at the point of a followed up breakout point.  
time and the depth of retrace play an important part.

If the price returned to the channel, but did not make a new min/max, the channel is not rebuilt. Maybe it will look like a few candles on the TL, back and forth. We transfer the Fibo lines only at the intersection of the TL and the candle body (not the shadow), when the candle again leaves the channel, but does not make a new min/max before that. Maybe later I will find you an example chart.

Hi InTheBox & Seysin,  
  
here is the graph i meant earlier, after the break a long wick piercing the channel (which is then I entered the trade after this candle), after that a group of candle entered the channel. The MA crossing, few candles after I made my trade.  
  
Divergen is there also in the channel. conclusion: after I got stop out then the trade went to TP 1, not my lucky day.  
  
What i've made wrong?

Stop loss hit with the way I applied the channel and Fibo, but when you arranged it, TP hits. Woot!   
  
I need to work on the channel, point 1, 2 and 3. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f642.png?v=15.1)

You are correct that trendlines are not reliable enough to use as a trading strategy. I have a long winded explanation of why I think that FCP should not be casually dismissed, if you are interested in reading along. I am not the spokes person here, but these comments reflect what I have learned.  
  
NB: My brain is wired to think in terms of prices, not exchange rates. When I say prices, you should translate that to pips.  
  
The Fibonacci Channel Projection describes a process that does use a trendline, but it is not a standard trendline that you would see in other systems. This process does not lead you to blindly make trades when the trendline is broken. Instead, this process starts with the identification of a large increase in price or a large decrease in price during a short period of time, after which prices has pulled back. For the purposes of my discussion, I will assume that the price is trending up and call the high price the apex. The apex is later used to form a channel. Near the base of the chart where the large increase started, you locate a lower price that will become a point on the trendline which I'll call TL. Then, you look for a another low price point that occurs after the apex and created as part of the pull back. This point becomes the second point of TL See Post 1 for the specific rule. Unlike standard trendlines, the trader gets to elect which 2 points are used. This may significantly affect the profitability of the trade. Seysin32 refers to this as the artistic part of the process.  
  
Next, you a create a channel, using the two low points (forming the TL) and the apex point. Then measure the vertical distance from the TL to the apex side of the channel. Since the two channel lines are equi-distant you can measure any vertical points along the channel. You will later, use this distance to create the projection. I like to think of this distance as the measured move.  
  
After the channel is created, you wait for price to break through the channel. It may be at or near the pullback point, or it may occur later in time and higher in price along the TL. At the point where the TL is broken, you draw a fibonacci retracement on the chart, placing the 1.0 fib line at the TL breakout. Measure down the chart a distance equal to the channel vertical distance (measured move) and place the 0.0 fib line there. The fib is used to project the measured move target for your trade.  
  
I explained this based on higher trending prices. It works exactly in reverse for lower trending prices with a break to the upside.  
  
Your job as a trader is to then use your own rules for entering the trade, so as to protect yourself from losses. You have a choice of taking profits at suggested triggers, or setting your own.  
  
In my opinion, what makes the FCP system work is the careful selection of dramatic swings in the market, then collecting a measured amount of pips on the anticipated reversal.  
  
Go to Post #1 and work through the posts until you think you understand how FCP is used. Then find some potential trades. Add the channel and fib projection to a chart and post the screenshot here, with your questions. You will receive a reply from someone who will give you honest but brief feedback. Then try a trade and see if it gives you usable results. If it doesn't, you can ask for a review here as well.  
  
The best of trading to you.

i think the main issue here is the expectation of target.  
your channel width is more than 100 pips.  
personally day trading for a m5/15 entry, we don't frequently get more than 100 pips profit.  
in my chart i lessen the channel width by placing point 3 at the outer channel providing around 60 pips or less target.  
  
i would shift the channel from your position to mine when A exceeded the previous high and  
B did not go lower than previous low. then there was a strong candle break down which gave me a better entry.  
then C and D formed but i did not shift the channel to D.  
reasons are D gave me a worst entry and i prefer a strong candle break at outer channel.  
both TP1 and 2 reached.

Hi Seysin, on this picture on Chart one you highlighted the part where the bar breaks the trend line but then goes back into the trend line and closes under. In the video you posted earlier you edited the trend line to the new peak when that same event occured. However on this chart you dont. What is the difference and when should I edit the trend line?

Hoichoi,  
I am still learning, but here is what I saw on the AUDUSD 5 min.  
The new low pivot at pt1 gives you a better breakout and entry.  
Its a winner to both targets. :-)

your channel is upward sloping, so you are selling.  
when price leaves the channel, it has to break down the bottom outer channel line.  
you have to shift your fib 100 to where price break down at the bottom outer channel line.  
  
please read post 1 three times with all the instructions, links and videos.  
compare.

there should not have any candle or tail touching the bottom channel line between point 1 and 2.  
also by not shifting the channel, the sell price is worst than mine.

when you are selling, the channel is sloping upward not downward sloping. see my chart of post 598.  
vice versa for buy.  
normal channel has 2 lines.  
fib channel let you better fit the fractals to any of the 5 lines.  
so you have more options and flexibility.

Hello. We rebuild the trend line whenever the price makes a new min/max. I deleted this image. It is controversial.  
Follow the general rules. Later I will give comments on this teme.

Hi Seysin,  
  
I put my SL to BE once my TP1 reach, and usually I take my profit either 1/3 or 1/2 of it. but on that trade, the price not even reach TP1 but to my SL first. as InTheBox said maybe in low TF it is better to make the channel < 60 pips  
  
cheers

imagine that you come to the computer at the red vertical line.  
where is the high point immediately before the red vertical line? isn't point 1 the right yellow arrow?  
then from that high point 1 put on a trend line to touch all the other high points to find your point 2.  
get a straight line with **only point 1 and 2 touching** with no other points touching before point 2 and in between point 1 and 2.

Hello. On each of the two charts, the price reached TP before it went higher. You did not have to lose. The maximum lose = BE.

Hello. Wrong. Refer to post 1. The price continues to go down. Wait for TL break. Rebuild the channel with a new low.

Hi Seysin32  
  
I really appreciate your efforts . I am hoping someday you'll allow me to make a difference as you have to me.  
  
i still dont understand the subjectivity of drawing the trendline. The Rule's say that we should find the last Highest Low (or bottom preceding the last maximum peak). On the contrary to an uptrend, we should find the last Lowest High (or Top preceding the last minimum peak) i assume.  
  
From the image you've recently shared, in a downtrend , isnt that the Highest peak? Point 2 circled by you looks like a High to me.  
Please understand i am trying to develop a trendline approach similar to yours so i can make correct observations going forward. i dont care if i lose a trade or 2 as long as i dont blow my account because of misinterpretation.  
  
Thanks again for your efforts.

In 1 Hour chart, Point 1 and 2 is established and that there'll be a pullback and a TL break to the upside.

Hi, Seysin. Thanks for the explanation. Here I attach another chart, and some questions are on the chart. Please advise whether am I correct or not. Thanks in advance.

Point 1 I marked the last local maximum preceding the minimum. From this point I drew a line to the left until the first touch with the shadow of the candle, this is point 2 (from point 1 to point 2 of the TL should not be crossed by candles).

There are no swings on H1 in your channel, it's just a continuous upward movement. However, there may be a model on the m5, but watch carefully for the trigger levels and the signal candle. While everything is going up, it may take time, do not rush and do not forget that today is Friday.

if i may give a different perspective.  
post 1: "On the example of uptrend.  
Find the last Highest Low (or bottom preceding the last maximum peak)."  
  
so in a downtrend, we find the last lowest high _**preceding**_ (just before or immediately before) the last bottom.  
this is the circled point 1 in the chart.  
then find point 2. the trend line from circled point 1 to circled point 2 should not be touched by any candle or its tail.

We never enter as soon as the price crosses the TL (there are exceptions to this rule). We expect the price to return to the level of 1.000 (Trigger 1) or to the level of 0.750-0.786 (Trigger 2). At these levels, we expect a signal candle. This issue has already been discussed in detail, links are collected in post 1.

Hi guys!  
It looks like the base of FCP is a pennant or I am wrong?

Probably we are talking about very similar things.  
I found that pennant with triple RD is a very good setup.  
Especially in the direction of tha main trend: we have 2 HH and 2 HL on H4:

This is a weak confirmation. Only as a trening.  
Look at my charts in the thread, where the price reached TP, what was the retest in this case.  
The week ends, the volume left the market. So you can rest.

I like to see the pennant after the impulse. In this case, it works better than when the price goes by slow swing.

if you had been trading just one currency pair yesterday.......  
gj h1 looked like it was in a range. but look at m5.  
2 sell trades would hit target fib 0.

ok so here are my questions if any one willing to reply.  
  
1: how to draw the parallel channels  
2\. how to measure the width of the channel since the post does not specify a point like point 1 or point 2 from which we need to measure the width

Do you move your fibo grid from the break of the TL to the actual entry point or does it always stay at the break of the TL no matter what? I guess if it returns to 1.000 that answers my question but what about trigger 2?

assuming you got the correct point 1 and 2, fib 100 remains at the intersection of trend line and candle body closing above/below it.  
trade entries will be price reactions at fib 100 and 78.2/75.

Beautiful thanks for the clarification. And for reactions we look for candlestick patterns at these levels 100 & 75-78.6. What kind of experience did you gather from your entry points so far?  
  
What is wrong with this setup? I mean, is it just a loss one or did some of the conditions not meet?

go to seysin's profile and click images. you will see how he entered trades (circled) at the 2 locations after a good closed candle (pin bar, engulf, etc)  
as for me i do enter trades without candle closing or go to the m1 chart, as long as we are trading in the htf direction.  
  
there was not enough information on the chart for a decision.  
1\. what was the higher time frame saying? higher high higher low?  
2\. based solely on the given chart, price was breaking out of a range. wait for retrace to buy at arrow. the 2nd, 3rd, 4th arrow if you arrived late at the computer.

use the h1 chart first to see direction, then use your own m5 chart to draw a new channel after the break out candle close of h1 chart.

the previous h1 fib projection was drawn upside down.  
now h1 fib projection both targets reached.  
  
m5 trading would have lesser profits, but there were 2 trade opportunities.  
the 2nd channel can be built at the white downward sloping line. all targets reached.

1 ) If your chart does not have the channel tool, you can use the trendline. You have already identified points 1 and 2 that define the TL. You are looking for point 3. In your case, it is the highest point above TL and also above the dotted resistance line. Measure from point 3 straight down to the intersection with TL. You will use this measure to draw your fibonacci retracement. 2) Yes, on my system it is called a fibonacci retracement. Some chart software may call it a different name.  
  
When you draw the fib, make sure that 1.0 is intersecting with the place on TL where the breakout occurs. 0.0 is the measured distance below the TL (on your chart).  
  
3) I don't have the fib channel tool on my charts, I only have the top and bottom channel lines. If I need a mid-point, I just draw it with a trendline tool.  
  
If you watch Seysin32's videos, you will see that he draws a fibonacci retracement from point 3 down to the TL, inside the channel. Then, he moves the fib over to where the 1.0 lines is at the breakout. If you can do that on your chart, you won't need to measure from 3 to TL.

Friends, I changed the Fibo levels a bit. Take a look at the screenshot.

As you can see, I added levels 0.236, 1.146, 1.382, 1.500 and 1.618. I will explain the meaning of the changes. Lines 1.146 - 1.618 allow us to see the reaction of prices to these levels before the price exits the channel. The rule is that if the price accurately responds to these levels, there is a high probability (but of course, this is not a guarantee) that it will also respond to other projection lines after exiting the channel. See how it works on the chart:

Levels 1.146 and 0.236 are also members of the Fibo number sequence and are located behind TP1 and TP2. How it works. If the price has precisely reached the level of 0.236 instead of 0.382 (TP1), the probability that the price will reach the level of 1.146 instead of 0.000 (TP2) increases. It just means a shift in TP levels.

These changes are not critical, you can use the levels that you use in your terminal and which work well for you. The main thing is that Trigger levels 1(2), TP1(2) remain unchanged.

actually success rate is irrelevant.  
because for expert it can be above 80%, to novice it can be 30%.  
or put it in another way.  
out of 100 people, how many will put through trades exactly like seysin? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)

Hi Seysin32, thanks for your new inputs.   
  
Just a question, your previous level 1.272 is used as a SL; for your new fibo configuration, where would you place your SL? 

Knowing is not enough, we must apply. Willing is not enough, we must do.

Level 1.272 it was not mandatory, only an approximate maximum for my SL. Usually I placed the SL slightly above the Trigger, from which I entered the trade. Or without SL, assessing the situation in combination of factors. Now for hard SL, I will focus on an area slightly above/below 1.146.

Simple deal.  
Part of the position is closed with + 27p, the rest part is released for running (SL= +5p).

It looks like "TradingZone"- similar with horisontal S/L zone. It's hard to draw it in MT4. For breakout upper border is valid; for rebound- lower border.

Hello, my friend!  
You asked about the likelihood of success. If I turn to the statement of my account, then more than 80% of the deals are successful (I do not like to talk about it, while I am living in Russia. I think you understand what I mean). I will say this, for me, the winrate is quite high. With the right approach and some experience, it will be possible for you too. I am not interested in a single amount per deal, only constancy. Even a small advantage with consistency makes us successful. In short, I try to approach trading according to the principle of the casino.  
The second question was about the time spent. Yes, I spent a very, very long time in front of the screen. For at least 7 years in a row I lived near a computer. With interruptions in sleep, food and physical exercises. There was a time, when I spent time in trade from morning to evening, seven days a week. It's very hard. Perhaps if I were led by an experienced mentor it would be easier for me (and I would not lose a lot of money), I do not know. Many times I wanted to give up all of this. I do not know if this is good or bad. I can not advise this to anyone. Everyone chooses for himself.

It is easy. Just press and hold CTRL and drag the line where you want.

the costs of learning by ourselves..........  
the tuition fees we pay to the market were the money we lost.  
plus our health, our eyesight, our time, our lack of sleep, our lack of social time, etc ........  
it's through high amount of interests and determination that bring you to where you are today.  
one thing for sure .......... no short cut.  
you reap what you sow.

can you tell me how you draw the channels ? . i use trading view and in that i have a channel that is divided in to two parts. although i looked in to MT4 but i can not see a channel that is divided in to four parts ( like your channel is always divided in to four equal parts )

Hi, Perhaps you can take a look at this [post](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=12871026#post12871026) for drawing of Fibo channel in MT4. 

Knowing is not enough, we must apply. Willing is not enough, we must do.

point 1 and 2 correct if you arrived at your computer at the left vertical line where the fib was drawn.  
if you arrived 10 bars earlier, the channel would have been steeper, unless you want to wait for further development.

Just to add on to the reply from IntheBox, you may want to configure the fibo channel as such.

The key is whether the price will continue in the direction of the channel break or in the direction of the channel. What helps you make decisions?

Friends, I said everything I wanted about the FCP method. I outlined the essence of the method, its rules and gave many examples (including several examples of live trading in the FCP). I believe that information, to understand enough, you only need to practice. Anyone who carefully studys everything that is collected in post 1 and reads in a thread a discussion, will be able to understand and use FCP. Now I have nothing more to add. I hope you will be react with understanding to the fact that I will rarely appear. I wish you good health, good mood and successful trading.

Spasibo [Seysin32](https://www.forexfactory.com/seysin32) and Thank you [Inthebox](https://www.forexfactory.com/inthebox).  
Great thread. Looks like I'm starting to understand how to draw channels and fib retrenchment, and it took me only 3-4 hours of reading this post and practicing. I'm far away from correct drawing but understanding is there. Now just "small part" left called practice. Don't want to ask any questions at this point as I think reading over and over and over all information multiple times will get me an answer, plus it's better learning that way. God bless you both and hope you have a successful trading ahead.

well said.  
but alas, there are some who wants short cut without spending the 4 hours of reading, much less reading over multiple times, preferring half understood knowledge.

Nope. I mean the entry and exit indicator mt4 file. 

Knowing is not enough, we must apply. Willing is not enough, we must do.

Noted and thank you Inthebox. I am not looking for an EA; just to check if you have the mt4 file that highlights your point of entry and exit.

if you would have traded the asia session.  
after the positive aud cpi news.  
2 opportunities.  
one below the day open line with fcp.  
the other below yesterday's low with horizontal fcp (as there was no chance of drawing a normal fcp).

If trend h4 / hl is opposite to m15 / m5, will it be more certain that trend m15 / m5 will be disrupted? 

Please excuse the bad English via Google Translate.

yes.  
not that one cannot do so but the risk will be higher and profit lower for trading counter trend.  
and only do it at higher time frame major support and resistance.

I'am doing the same way like you- enter with 1/2 lot on breakout, and then add position on retrace.It works so far ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Hello, first of all I want to thank you for sharing the knowledge and effort Seysin.  
  
I've started reading the thread (I'm around half-way), was practising and I've got some doubts that the rules don't make clear to me to build the channel, perhaps is because english is not my native language or because I didn't finish the thread, if is the second case I apologize.  
  
When a impulse is not too "energic" from 1, you place the 3 in the center of the channel, but this does not happen everytime; for example when the swing from 1 is not too big, then you make 3 in another point and not the max/min of the swing from 1, like here (post 32):  
[https://www.forexfactory.com/attachm...6&d=1585936486](https://www.forexfactory.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=3597346&d=1585936486)  
Is my guess about right?  
  
Also, I know you can build 3 from 1 or 2 with a big impulse and 3 will be on the other side of the channel, but is it possible to build a not too big impulse from 2 to the center of the channel and make it 3 like you do when the impulse goes from 1 to 3? (See picture as example I edited)

Hope is not too confusing! Thanks

seysin stated yesterday that he had completed all he has to show in this thread and he will rarely be here.  
if we read carefully his posts the answer should be there. so maybe we have to read them multiple times.  
  
my opinion concerning point 3 from 1 or 2.  
in your chart, point 1 to 3 is straighter and have less retrace than point 2 to 3. so point 1 to 3 is to be used.  
you have placed the channel mid line on point 3. this is correct.  
if you find that the channel width is too wide, place the channel outer line on point 3 to make channel narrower.  
if you find that the channel width is too narrow, place the channel 25% line on point 3 to make channel wider.

so the channel is adjustable to cater for your target expectation.  
a good channel is built when price reacts to as many channel lines as possible.

from post 1.  
_FCP disadvantages:_  
\- **Requires some trading experience, not suitable for absolute beginners.**  
\- MT4 is not the best software for graphical constructions.  
\- **You can not immediately take and use**.  
  
i know that there are many novices looking at this thread.  
i understand that it would be difficult to follow if you do not have 1-2 years of trading experience.  
i would advise to try it a couple of times to see whether it suits your style of trading.  
if it does not suit beginners, i would advise to go for more simple thread like "roadmap" which uses moving averages to trade.

Thanks  
Do you use any indicator for previous days high/lows? or you mark them manually?  
Looks like pivots were close to those numbers as well.

The trade went pretty well. Redraw my channel a bit like yours, but looks like it's all subjective, but I see what you mean. I think the trend might reverse from here, lets see.

to mitigate the subjectivity, use fractal.  
shift channel to the right when there is a higher low being formed.

hey "inthebox" . i have been trying this method but i am not getting an intutional sense of it. there are few questions if you would like to answer since "sye" is no longer addressing this thread.  
1\. since we are trading breakouts i am having trouble identifying them  
2\. how to tell that the breakout will be upwards or downward ? ( although i know the trendline will project project the direction but how to decide the direction . for eg. in 1 hour you see the the graph rising but in say 5m you see an upward trendline thus we are betting for it to breakdown lower.  
3\. when to enter a trade. as sye told that the graph will retest it but in many cases during breakdown the prices moves very fast ( in 1m or 3m ) thus you can never actually see the restest and the trade that was needed to go right goes wrong. and the winning percentage declines.  
i will really apppreciate any help from anyone who uses this method.  
thanks. ( i have read the thread but still read it again if anyone suggest a post that particularly answers my questions . )

Coin tossing will be about as accurate as other methods.

1\. since we are trading breakouts i am having trouble identifying them  
if you are having problem with lower time frame, why not switch to higher time frame. switch your time frame one or two higher.  
2\. how to tell that the breakout will be upwards or downward ? ( although i know the trendline will project project the direction but how to decide the direction . for eg. in 1 hour you see the the graph rising but in say 5m you see an upward trendline thus we are betting for it to breakdown lower.  
solely looking at h1 graph rising is not a basis to sell in m5. something is missing. h4 must be falling to reflect that h1 rising is a retracement.  
my example in the chart using h4 as htf and m30 as ltf.  
in simplified form, h4 is enough to show me the medium trend.  
3\. when to enter a trade. as sye told that the graph will retest it but in many cases during breakdown the prices moves very fast ( in 1m or 3m ) thus you can never actually see the restest and the trade that was needed to go right goes wrong. and the winning percentage declines  
it's very chopping in m3 and m1 as the stop loss is very tight but that's your choice. if you find m15 is not so choppy then use it.  
to get the best of both world, split into 2 positions - one for breakout, one for retrace.  
  
do your own back testing. i believe that there are much more successful trades than failed one. and don't forget it also depends on your expectation how far the trade can move.  
and also it will fail at the region when h4 begin to switch sides.

Coin toss is 50/50, forex spread makes it worse. Lots of indicators = lots of coins.

in my experience i have gathered 7 indications for trading in post 1 of my journal.  
the more indications the better.  
in this thread, we have trend, channel break, fibonacci and oscillator for divergence.  
so it's not a problem for me.  
  
i am around to tighten up the loose end just in case some one needs clarification.  
if the participation has gone down, i too will leave this thread as probably most questions posed would have been answered.  
just need reading again and again.

@Inthebox, I've made a pdf of all the information about FCP. I have a question. When I found a enough indications for a trade on the 1h, I wait for the price to roll back to the trigger point. My question:  
  
Do I need to stay on the h1 to see the the candle close or is it also possible to switch to the m15 for a closer look and take the trade when a m15 candle close? 

You'll get what you give.

Hello, friends. I hope all of you are well.  
As I noticed, many have difficulty in defining the 3rd point in the examples, that we analyzed and they looked "not according to the rules." Let’s clarify this question. There is nothing complicated about it. Consider the example of the uptrend. When you built the channel, look at the left side of the chart behind the outside of the channel. What did the price do before it hit the channel? Did she fall or go up in the direction of your channel (trend)? If the swings rise up, you can expand the channel so that one of the top appears on the midline. And that’s all. You may ask - we get a wider projection, will it work? The answer is yes, if you get confirmation at the price of Fibo levels before the breakdown of the channel and confirmation at the price of Trigger levels 1 and 2 (especially 2). In addition, when choosing the channel width, consider that you are building a projection on the trend, or on its correction (see htf). I picked up a few examples so that you understand how it looks.

By the way, someone said about throwing a coin. This is a very good example. I wrote earlier that my approach to trading is similar to the principle of a casino. This is not the same as throwing a coin. At the casino there is an advantage (I'm talking about roulette) - this is zero. So the odds are 49/50, or so. But this 1% gives the casino billions of dollars. The question is the number of deals. Build your advantage on your system and use it. I am sure that we all have it and it is much more than 1%. It remains to do the same thing. There will always be those who did not bother to study and try, and those who did. The difference between them becomes visible only with time. The first will simply disappear, and you will live. The FCP system itself does not give you a big advantage, it’s just a template, fill it with what you better own, and it will work like a good watch.  
Good luck friends.

My question: Do I need to stay on the h1 to see the the candle close or is it also possible to switch to the m15 for a closer look and take the trade when a m15 candle close?
> 
> Ignored

so i take it that both h1 and m15 is used for trade entry. remember to look at h4 for trend.  
this means  
h4 is rising --> h1 is falling (retracement) --> m15 expecting soon to be rising as per h4 trend.  
it will be dependent on your expectation of profit.  
if entry per h1, then it is h1 target (larger) --> look only at h1.  
if entry per m15, then it is m15 target (smaller) --> look only at m15.  
or if entry per m15, but h1 target --> look only at h1, because your fib is based on h1 channel.

Update on today's trade on EUR/JPY. Exited 10-15 pips below daily highs, was expecting it to go to the pivot and TP2 but saw strong rejection and thanks to IntheBox was watching out for previous days highs. In general great trade I enter little early as my rules for my other system were there, total 52 pips on this trade.  
I see the most trades with this system are great for TP1 as Seysin sad safe point.

depending on the currency pair, be realistic and flexible about targets.  
for example, gbpjpy (the beast).  
asia session - channel width about 20-30 pips without news.  
london/new york session - channel width double or triple that of asia session.

i would like to tell the rest that if you miss an original trade opportunity,  
this is a good example of waiting for lower high lower low in smaller time frame.  
the question as always is whether we have the patience to wait for it.

both ok.  
i prefer the 1st m15 chart with smaller channel width due to candles responded to the channel inside lines and eu target of 40 odd pips.

do you find that your trading has improved over these past 2 weeks?  
or is it due to your past experience?

I think it's improved. I have been trading for 2 years. I have a Micro account. I always preferred indicators and little I painted in the graph. It was a mistake. It's very important and I see how it helps me. And I'm learning patience in opening stores. And also money management. This was critical for me in the past, I let the trades run at a loss, instead of closing them and finding a better entry. A long way to go ....

the trend line in red is a proper trend line (to me).  
the one in yellow is demark trend line.  
i would say both can be used.  
demark offers opportunities when the proper trend line was missed.

something to think about concerning the last sell entry in previous post.  
it would not be a location for entry if the channel is drawn as follows.  
so try to find a channel that can give you a better entry.

Very nice system, will post some more trades later. I did around 10 of them for whole time I joined the thread. Only 1 didn't work out and I think it was due to end of trading day, price went down eventually. However, great winning ratio comes with TP1 point only for now. Many TP2 at 0 doesn't work out.

I agree. It certainly helps me in making a clearer decision.   
  
Reaching TP2 is a bonus ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

session period and currency pairs play a big part.  
for example eur, gbp vs jpy, aud, nzd, cad  
can hit tp 2 with 30 to 60 pips in london/new york session.

different people draw trend lines differently and this will affect results.  
one also should know stuff like inner trend lines and outer trend line.

Hello, friends!  
I hope everyone is doing well.  
I am glad to see that you are using the method and this gives the result.  
Two fresh examples. On the EUR/USD chart, a beautiful FСP and a good result.  
The second XAUUSD chart, is an example of the projection of a horizontal channel. This is a new approach to projections of horizontal channels.  
I’m not ready to explain it to you until I have done a sufficient number of tests. But in advance I can say that it works well. It is interesting that on the chart you will see the projection, but you will not see the channel ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1). As soon as I am convinced that the method works, I will share it with you.

In today's world, the number of subscribers is not a guarantee of the quality of the content.  
Channels filled with all sorts of nonsense have millions of subscribers. If you know what I mean... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f642.png?v=15.1)  
At some point, we must choose - either the income from trading, or the income from advertising (as we are called in this case?).

My candles look different. In my opinion, if not considering HTF this projection was difficult to trade.   
See my version on the chart.

Your graph looks very different =) Maybe broker difference. This is bigger chunk of my graph. Very interesting but I find Fibs very often connect with even numbers.

when buying channel should be sloping downward or horizontal (when ranging).  
entry price will be better than upward sloping channel.  
you can draw upward sloping trend line to show uptrend.  
in the chart, channel is in opposite direction to trend line to reflect channel is retracement.

this is a good educational video on outer trend line and inner trend line.  
focus on the m5 chart and treat the short upward sloping trend line as channel.

Ok, will study more. I see inthebox posted correct drawing =) However, for week and half of trading I have 14 wins and 1 loss which is not bad. Im neither very lucky or my other system plus almost 4 years of PA watching paying off as well.  
Last trade for today USD/CAD. Did catch the top was watching it from the morning.

as per trading a m15 chart, the short trade had already fulfilled the target of tp1 and tp2 before the reversal.

Firstly, this is not entirely true. If you watched the price at the time of the news, you could see how, after the publication of the news, the price began to fall. This went on for about an hour. All who expected the sale, sold. Well, then the price did, what was expected - turned up. Secondly, what will happen next no longer matters, the model worked.

Have a question to most experienced users...Which one of options below is the correct one?  
  
The channel created on A is wider but looks more balanced than B.

if you prefer A, the channel is too wide for h1.  
h4 or d1 would have a more balanced view. this means that the trade would have been held longer.  
  
h1 would have presented more trade opportunities but with shorter targets.  
  
trade targets according to the time frame one is trading.

i have a different view.  
trend is down but price at d1 support.  
price is in a range per yellow box.  
use horizontal channel when price break out of box.

Thanks Inthebox for your response,  
  
I have also done up EU as shown... did i draw correctly? I feel that the Channel 1 is in play now and might go to the TP as shown by the arrows before price comes down to put Channel 2 into play.

work needs to be done on channel point 3.  
  
analyze to trade trend or counter trend. probably counter trend gets one third or quarter of trend target.  
good old trend is higher high higher low.  
if in doubt on your reference chart, go one or two higher up chart.  
d1 tells me in range. h4 tells me in range and in triangle. coming to apex for breakout.  
price above h4 yellow dotted trend line, i shall buy only.  
h1 watch out for downward sloping channel to buy.

Hi there,  
  
May I ask which option between A and C is most convenient or even correct?  
  
Following creation rules for FCP, we should find the Highest Low (or bottom preceding the last maximum peak) for point 1, from there point 2 and then 3. And this is draw on figure A.  
  
I've found several examples where different Highest Lows are used and they does not preceed the maximum peak. Figure C  
  
  
Figure B is just the middle point scenario between A and C, where a trigger candle is not present and we must correct our channel.  
  
Thanks in advance.

channel needs to be redrawn (or not redrawn) as new fractals are created.  
so it would depend on the time you are at the computer (represented by vertical yellow line)  
  
A - present no set up.  
B - channel shifted and entry after retrace (assuming your style is to wait for retrace)  
C - channel need not be redrawn as at that point in time there was already retrace coming at B.

In this case our point 1 now always will be the " Highest Low (or bottom preceding the last maximum peak)" and that was my initial concern trying to find a mechanical way to draw FCPs.  
  
Based on fractals (assuming we are talking about Bill Williams Fractals) the FCP should be as follows:

In addition to what Inthebox said. Always pay attention to what did the price before the channel. In option "A" you include in the channel the area of pure upward movement. In this case, the probability of reaching the target projection levels is greatly reduced.

Inthebox said everything correctly. In my opinion, the best setting is option B. Two tops are approximately at the same level, in such cases we ignore the insignificant difference between the tops levels.

Based on fractals (assuming we are talking about Bill Williams Fractals) the FCP should be as follows: {image}

in my opinion trading is not an exact science. can be mechanical but cannot be 100% mechanical.  
what i try to illustrate with the following chart is that one has to consider the context of what is happening in the surrounding.  
if i had drawn trend line B without consideration to trend line A, then all my entries will be getting a worst price than using trend line A.  
  
likewise if two point 1 is ambiguous/not clear due to the levels made not much difference, then the basis is that i compare the present and previous, and take the one that can give me a better price.

Hello Seysin, Thank you for sharing your method. From backtesting in hindsight it looks very good entry method for my approach. That said i use it only on M5 TF on predetermined key levels.   
Now i start to forward test on some positions to explore more. My targets also not always agrees with your method, but i need much more testing to see which target approach works better for me.  
  
After first seeing this approach i started to see this setups everywhere on every TF. I think it's important not to get lost in the bushes and observe this pattern on significant levels. Well at least for me as FCP is everywhere.  
  
Heres one Deal i made today. UC. My exit obviously too early, i will adapt with time.

Hello. I am glad that you use the FCP and see the potential for yourself in this. This is really a very simple and effective method. Now in my trade I do not use anything else. Follow the top-down analysis HTF to LTF, consider the strong levels of S/R and the opening of the day. And that’s all. You always get your pips.

This what i meant by its everywhere. GJ i see slightly different. But its just shows that usually u can find this pattern both ways it's comes down to whose overall bias is right.   
And i not trying to find mistakes here, just interested to discuss how can we make sure that we on the right side of FCP.

yes it can go both ways. but which way can hold better? that's where different experience comes in.  
my bias is down so i take sell. i can buy but target should be small.  
if i sell only, i have 2 options.  
1\. to exit trade take a loss if not going my way for the moment and try to sell again with better price later?  
2\. to hold trade because my higher time frame tells me to do so?

gj result.  
on hindsight, m30 offered a better channel.  
the higher time frame trend saved the day even with lousy entries.

Thank you Seysin for reply. Yes FCP on GJ would workout both ways. Everybody happy.  
  
New week, new setups.  
  
Ussually i am slow on Mondays, but i think this FCP Deal on Gold worth a stab. Out of the gate it reached ATR expecting at least some pullback. TP1 looks realistic as it is previous resistance.  
  
Edit: Stoped/ shoulda leave more breathing room, whent to TP1

eurjpy, euraud, eurnzd, eurcad.  
gbpusd, gbpjpy, gbpaud, gbpnzd, gbpcad.  
  
i find that m30 and above channel gives me lesser deep retracement.

Thanks for sharing.. Sometimes for these pairs, their long wicks are hard a bit to read. Will try to practice more on these pairs.

For those who buy the retrace at the trigger zones (0, .786-.75). How far does the price have to move away from the 0 line on the initial move for you to cancel the trade. For example if the price make an initial move from the 0 line to the TP1 (.386) will you not buy again at the retrace to the trigger lines?

as long as price does not close below TP2, i will take the buy, especially so in smaller time frame. because the channel width is smaller and there is more wriggling.  
the reasoning is price often retraces to test the break out zone.

Hello guys, first let me tell You that this is nice thread. Honestly, I tried first time like yesterday / today and I'm not sure if I do it correctly. Kinda fun, but I tried it on phone. What about this EUR/USD monthly chart? Can be kinda interesting tbh.  
  
Here's a picture.  
  
Tell me please if correct. I'm almost sure it is OK, but not sure about the second line. And on phone.. Pff.. Disgusting piece of hell to write something. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
  
Thanks Guys, SF.

I should say that this drawdown is kinda big, isn't it? You trade it manually or some kind of auto? Thanks ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

was not around to take another sell at the zone when ltf regular divergence formed at htf resistance zone.

Got it, You are correct. I only look EUR/USD most of the time. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1) I would do the same probably.

Yep. Thanks mate. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) I doubt it will go up immediately, but we can check for some trade. Does look pretty good to me.

SilentFather, I do not use your product, so I do not know how to change the individual cells in your image. It looks as though they have already been modified once. Note the values you already have, then click the Restore Defaults button. You should see the fibonacci levels restored with the appropriate settings.

i have a high tolerance for stop loss if i am at the computer.  
i exit if a h1 candle (1) closes below a h1/h4 fractal next level below and subsequent h1 candle (2) not able to close above the h1 candle (1) high.  
in this case, a h1 candle closes below previous day low.

It looks like strong downtrend (2LH+2LL) with no clue of reversal-> low probability trade.It should be more then 2 factors to enter the market in case of daytrading.  
Check out Inthebox trades: it's 5 or 6 indies on the chart.

Yes. Also there’s bears engulfing pattern & pinbar rejecting higher prices. That’s why I exit earlier.

i will be here less frequent.  
  
try to trade with the methodology below.  
  
in short: breakout, retrace, continuation in the direction of higher time frame trend, preferably with divergence.  
  
example for sell in a down trend. take the upward sloping trend line as a channel.

Here is a simple daytrading strategy using FCP:  
check out this [link](https://www.investing.com/technical/technical-summary) and find strong trending pair (let's say Strong Sell on H1); check out indies for not beeng oversold; check out nearest support; go to M5-15 and use FCP to sell.  
One may add breaking of previous day low/high- it's a big plus to make a higher probability trade.  
HD and RD are very helpfull as well.

It's about 120 pips to the strong suppor-> big room to open a few sell orders. I am planing to add sell orders with smaller lots after putting SL to BE.

GPB/NZD H1.  
I wont trade this yet, as its looking for the big reversal of this long downtrend (daily look good though)  
But it show how the Seysin method is amazing, using 0.75/0.786 fib region. Broken and retest tell you your channel is right.

Another example and confluence.  
CADCHF H4  
  
When 0.786/0.75 Zone is a SR flip. it really add confidence.  
Also the break off the channel is right on the 20 EMA.  
  
Notice how the zone is also exactly at daily pivot.... this is my favorite setup... SR Flip + Daily pivot. and of course divergence on last swing.

to enter, you go to lower TF and do the exact same thing... and the zone are equally perfectly respected. magic

Looks promising. Waiting for bounce from support.

EA. Lost trade.  
Catched divergence, also channel breaks. Entered on next swing, but saw some strange upside moving (higher lows) & some strength of bulls. Exited earlier, before SL.  
Also a mistake was entering in such trade when price ranging near strong support on D1.

Hmm. My MACD show another picture. What indicator you use?  
  
Aha. MACD_OsMA. As I understand it something like MACD + OsMA?

hi experts,  
  
I am currently trying FCP on my demo account before dabbling it on a real account. May I know what did i miss out in this chart? EURJPY was able to hit 38.2 but it had a strong drawback till entry level. How do I know whether or not my trade will be invalidated before it reaches 0.0?? Thanks

Hi! Sorry if I may sound "ironic". But if anyone __**knew**__ what will happen, we would not be in this forum...  
  
The chart looks perfect to me. Beautifully hit the 38.2. And then? We never know.  
A good idea imho in this case would be to work with trailing stops. If it continues: perfect. If not: at least saved part of the win

I see some kind of bullish engulfing on H1. You need to investigate deeper. On M30 & M15 there's bullish regular divergence, also multiple bullish engulfing PA appeared. Also you can check a volume - bears not pushing price anymore, bulls trying to catch the move.  
  
Also, try to avoid creating big wide channels. Wide channel increasing you risk.

we never know when's the reversal.  
look left, there was a pause at fib 38.2. that was a support.  
that was a good 70-80 pips run. i normally look for 30 to 60 pips.  
  
many ways for target.  
exit everything at fib 38.2.  
or one exit at 38.2, the other at 0.  
or i can double the lot size with half the distance.  
or  
keep channel width say 30 to 60 pips. that will reduce the fib extention which make it easier to hit fib 0.

EU. Some interesting situation. We have 2 opposite signals (for bullish divergence & bearish trend continuation), but second signal appeared later.  
Channel fully broken. Missed first wave, but catched some pips on second. Also NY session opened, so waiting for PA confirmation that bears are still in game.

this is a good example of trading the _retracement_ _according_ to the time frame target that one is trading.  
if the m5 gives 10 - 15 pips, so be it.  
  
this is in accordance to the methodology of post [942](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=12994218#post12994218).

Thank you ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) I keep learning & trying to find more confirmations when entering the trade. OsMA really good indicator, but need some time to adapt to it.

all nicely packed in post 1 with many linked examples.  
but first you must get the channel points 1,2,3 correctly.  
don't understand, ask again.

Here are the trendlines for H1 according to Sperando method (as stated in post #1 'In the FCP, for TL we will use the Sperandeo method (Trader Vic).')  
the two red one are strict Spredando TL the, yellow one an accepted one by Seysin method.  
  
if you would trade at the point you enter you prolly would need to go to a lower time frame to find a valid channel.  
Others are using less strict TL but it its not the OP method, so its difficult to expect correct Fibonacci projection if the channel is wrong from the start.

Using the Valid trendline, this would be the result for EURJPY H1. you see, this was actually a very good FCP.

it actually selling/buying the first pullback after a confirmed trend change guys. Adam H Grimes call it the 'Anti' pattern, google it its a great trader/teacher... but FCP gives you more : confirmation levels AND targets. truly amazing. cheers all

Seysin said that mt4 not the best, not me.  
deal with the 2 comments first:  
1\. if selling, the lower channel should not touch any price body or shadow.  
2\. your channel is more than 160 pips wide, which means that you are expecting target of there about. are you comfortable with that? i myself expects 30-60 pips for day trading.

Oooh. This channel is too wide. Try to build more tight channel, it would give you not so much in pips, but be more safe & target can be easily reached.  
Also on M30 there's trend continuation divergence, so you could enter on second swing.

you got point 1 and 2 correct. now work on point 3.  
get point 3 as straight a line from point 1 or point 2 with as few retracement as possible. see 1st example.  
the placement of the channel at point 3 is adjustable. can be the extreme outer line, the mid line, or the quadrant line so as to get different fib projection.  
  
i provide another perspective of h1. the channel point 2 is not drawn on the lowest point as per above example.  
the distance of point 1 and 2 is shorter. it's ok as long as the channel bottom line does not touch any candle body or tail to the left.  
  
the drawing of channel would very much dependent on when is your arrival on seeing the chart.  
m15 showed a late arrival at chart compared to an earlier arrival. it was a break out entry. no retrace.

yes there is an attraction to the stronger upper resistance zone, probably to fib 61.8. then the down trend continuation. just watching for the main event turning point at the 2 zones.

Today, wish to trade GBPUSD m5.  
In first setup:  
Trade was missed, price was fly away quickly without deep retracements, so forgot this setup and build another for sell.  
In second setup:  
First spike was lost but then price consolidating, I saw some PA - high price rejection (pinbar & doji) but news coming in calendar. Changed deal to smaller lot size & decided to leave it one. That was risky, but spike was controlled by bears & price rollbacked to its position at beginning (•̀ᴗ•́)و

do you recognize the pattern [here](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=12994218#post12994218)?  
trading is like dealing in property. it's about location, location, location.  
trading is about waiting at the location for the right timing.  
below example waiting for price to reach the flip or first time back location.  
then apply the channel.

What do you guys usually check first?   
  
Pairs?   
Timeframe?   
Divergence?   
Highs and Lows/ S & R?   
  
Do you combine timeframes like 1Hr and 5Min?   
  
Thanks. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

I’m trading eurusd/gbpusd on m5.  
First, checking economic calendar to be ready for price spikes.  
Then checking m15/m30/h1 to find S&R.  
Building fibo channel & waiting for divergence/price action/volumes changes.  
Combining TFs is important for build S&R zones and choosing bulls or bears side.

don't know what type of trader are you, which classification you fall into.  
to me, for day trading, time is not a factor to exit trade, except at the time before i go to bed to hold or not to hold.  
what matters more is which level of SR that i want to exit if price pull back.  
like [here](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=13007532#post13007532), i felt that the upper resistance zone is stronger, so i held on.  
but for scalping, it's different. you exit at the resistance just above as whipsaws occurring are higher.  
however there is also more opportunities for trade set ups.  
so medium term trading and investing are another story.

if there is a strong h1 candle (not pin bar) that closes above that top most resistance, i exit the trade. no hard stop loss for me unless i go to bed.

I was waiting for the breakout and didn't pay attention to that down move. It went 100 pips though. Missed.

the smaller time frame showed downtrend.  
went into a range and broke down.  
  
the [h4 h1](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=13009013#post13009013) broke a downward sloping trend line.  
they are not uptrend or downtrend as have yet to break the top to qualify as uptrend.  
my bias is slightly to the upside for higher time frame.

I see some kind of regular divergence, but another hidden divergence signal also tells me that downtrend could continue. Wait for retracement & confirmation of bulls strength.  
But on H4/D1 I see uptrend.

What does Seysin mean in post 19 when he says: 5) When you built the channel, check it: the price swings inside the channel should be combined with the internal lines of the channel (25%, 50% and 75%).

Grab some pips, but closed deal earlier because of today's EU Summit. Also 2 bulls divergences was a result of my decision. Price jumped as expected.

need not be a strictly hs neckline entry.  
just for info, it's a quasimono which gave an earlier entry than hs, although on first look similar.  
could also be taken at a lower time frame.

Thanks for the answer, I get it.  
I did not see FCP models on your chart, so I posted my chart so that you can analyze your mistakes.  
H&S, divergences and etc, complement the FCP model. In this case, the model was quite accurate, we can say beautiful.  
With proper building, you would receive an accurate signal to Trigger line 1 and the exact achievement of TP.  
That is all that is needed.

Seysin32, is it correct to build channel through opens/closes of candles, not through highs/lows?

It will be right to build a model on Highs/Lows.

although there was a pin bar, i guess the resistance zone will hold.

Looks good. You could enter a little earlier, cause of bearish engulfing PA. Now I'd better wait & see how price retraces & catch hidden divergence.

You didn't place the maximum peak on the on the mid line of the channel. Instead used previous as Point 3. Is this because divergence is inside the channel?

I deliberately placed a mini-chart H1 in the corner of the chart m15, so that you can see the construction of the channel.

I think channel was built a little bit incorrectly. Also there was uptrend continuation divergence, but fortunately downtrend continuation divergences appears on M15.

What an inspiration.

Only the disciplined ones are free in life.  
If you are undisciplined, you are a slave to your moods, you are a slave to your passions.  
If you want to be successful, you must respect one rule ......  
and that rule is: Never lie to yourself."

Hi Stef! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
I'm great. I mainly do scalping on m1/m5. Therefore, rarely publish here.  
In addition to that, I have nothing special to say, except what has been said here about the FCP.  
I just trade for a living. I am quite satisfied with several small deals a day, so that the rest of the time I will go about my things.  
Something like these deals this morning:

EURUSD H1  
Today, investigating how to build channel & get early but safe entry.  
Used version 1 of setup but think it's not right, cause catched risky price jump - that's why not perfect entry ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f937-200d-2642-fe0f.png?v=15.1)  
But will be cool to use version 2:  
Think that channel should be built closer to price divergence - it give more opportunity for early entry & more space for possible strong price retracements.  
What do you think? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)

there were many factors came into play, of which the most important is  
the strong candle that break the support/resistance and/or the trend line/channel.  
  
opinion after the fact.  
the left image shown was 'perfect'  
1\. strong candles break and pullback at both sr and tl channel.  
2\. price under major d1 support turned resistance.  
3\. retracement to fib 50/61. head and shoulder formed with lower right shoulder.  
4\. divergence.  
  
people can draw the channel differently.  
the right image still worked out fine.  
there was a trend line /channel break and a pullback on the same candle.  
can see better in lower time frame and entry could be at fib proj 100.

Hi Seysin32, and all together here!  
  
I trade PA with MAs only on M5-H1 TFs  
Sometimes I can make very good Entries  
but I make very rare good Exits,  
therefore your Thread with this default Levels for TP1 @ 0.38 and TP2 @ 0.00  
is a nice Dream for me  
Seysin, you wrote about _Advantages of FCP_ :

I subscribed this Thread immediately  
and I want to learn your System...  
  
I trade with MT4,  
I have read your Posts for Settings FCP in MT4  
And I can draw the Channels now  
  
But I did not make anything with Fibo before  
therefore I can not find Fibo Grid on MT4  
  
There are 2 Tools here:  
Retracement and Expansion  
but both have Numbers  
that differ from yours...  
Which Tool I have to use??  
Or may be other Settings???  
  
Many Thanks  
vvm

Hello and welcome.  
Use the Draw Fibonacci Retracement tool. Additional levels can be easily added (post [203](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=12871931#post12871931)).

we trade the breakout of channel, not the bounce inside the channel.

For to start. Don't trade low TFs. Train at least H1 with the minimum position size. Take a look at the chart below - you had no reason to go short.

Above Trigger Line 1 (100.0 Fib), you can use levels no higher than 161.8.

In this case, of course, you meant the sell. I very rarely open a position immediately after a channel breakout. The reason is simple - you will have a very low win rate. Basically, we enter after retesting trigger levels 1 or 2 (1.000 and 0.786-0.750 Fib). The appearance at these levels of candlestick patterns, PA patterns, volume changes, etc. will give you a signal to enter with a good R/R ratio. All this was consider in detail at the beginning of the thread. For example [post](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=12855580#post12855580)

Yes. Looks perfect. But I decided to choose more narrow channel because of ECB Press Conference & other important news.

Annoying. I'm here to learn, not to troll people. Any way. Last night I blew up an account on the simulator trying to learn this ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1). Today is another day.

I will. Thanks for the good words.   
  
Is this channel correct? Should I expect the price to go up?

Perhaps, but additional signals are needed. In this case, I would not use such a channel. While waiting for the trend to continue, it is better to look for an opportunity to enter on LT. I advise you not to look for current entry opportunities in the live market, but to train in building the "classic" FCP model (based on historical data), which is described in the first posts of the thread. This is a proven way of learning.

When in time do you draw the channel? do you draw before waiting to break up? Can you highlight the candle of drawing the channel, please? Also, can you catch in the print screens the time, would be very helpful.

USDCHF H1+M30+M15  
Interesting trade on 3 timeframes.  
On H1 channel was broken but there's no visible accurate divergence.  
Switched to M30, detected trend continuation divergence. Waiting for confirmation & PA.  
Switched to M15. also trend continuation divergence catched. Decided to enter.  
Resistance zone confirmed its strength, price rolled down.

If I understood your question correctly, then: First - TL, then breakout (with confirmation), then building a channel and Fibo projection.  
This is shown here: [post](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=12870687#post12870687), [post](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=12884346#post12884346).

Hey, Your strategy looks intriguing and Im interested in eventually implementing it, however I'm still a beginner(practicing on demo) and I don't think Im quite at the level of experience to succesfully implement FCP. What indicators/strategies should I practice/play with a little to build up my experience to be able to understand FCP fully?

go back to old school. higher high, higher low.  
  
use the fractals. read post#1 three times.  
1\. when a fractal is broken (keep on adjusting)  
2\. draw trend line (channel)

Hello.  
For your first post, Inthebox has already said everything, I completely agree with him.  
As for this:

the second chart is correct. You yourself can see, how the price subsequently "respected" the levels of your projection. Add level 88.6 to the projection. If I'm not mistaken, it was retested.

Sell is not confirmed here, IMHO.  
1\. Yes, we see bears divergence.  
2\. But, bulls has strength, and bulls divergence detected. Also bullish engulfing pattern & pinbar that rejecting lower prices tells that setup is not confirmed.  
So we have false channel breakout.  
Don't hurry, keep calm & wait for strong & 100% confirmed setup.  
You can use OsMA indicator with 8,21,8 settings. It shows more data about divergences.  
Please, be careful ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f64f.png?v=15.1)

m5 vs h1.  
don't forget higher time frame analysis.  
  
1\. resistance tested 5 times - matter of time will break up.  
2\. broke down upward sloping trend line, then reversed back above.  
3\. and 2nd time back up trend line as a pin bar with higher low.  
4\. compare the first 2 resistance touches with the last 3. the bounces down getting shorter.  
5\. hidden divergence - means trend continuation.  
  
all the above are footprints telling momentum is up.

are you looking to sell?  
higher time frame analysis.  
i think more chance to buy by waiting for pullback as resistance broken turned support.

1\. choose location and _**wait**_ at htf sr or tl (h1 and above). looking for rejection.  
2\. wait for sr or tl (yellow) break.  
3\. refine with ltf channel and wait for pullback entry.  
4\. fibo projection for targets.

I expected this, but did not think it would happen so quickly.  
The movement continues, but my order was triggered and I am out of the game.  
Good result, my money is in my pocket. Green pips guys, I'm going for a running.

Seysin,  
  
It looks like you have added the trigger level of 0.886 to your FIBO and have executed at that level. I have noticed that is also a key level or retracement on scalps. Can you confirm if this is now part of your FCP?

USDCAD H1+M15  
Playing with divergences.  
1\. Downtrend on USDCAD so searching for sell entries.  
2\. Catched downtrend continuation divergence & bears divergence on M15.  
3\. Channel broken.  
4\. Catched bulls divergence, but then downtrend continuation appeared.

Your approach to learning FCP is thorough. Nobody before you asked me about it. I have not placed the time on the charts to emphasize the versatility of the metod. Besides, everyone has a different time. But you're right, you need to know the date and time for research in old charts.

Sorry, I can't understand anything from your chart...  
Try to make the channel lines lighter and also place the FСP projection lines on the chart.

Retest of resistance and breakout of channel lines, no need for projection. "Project" with new structure nothing else, use further channel lines when price is at median / fair value price

friend, i have seen your trades. you were winning today but stayed too long in the trades.  
if you do not mind, the following are 2 big killers.  
1\. big lot units  
2\. overtrade  
unless you are trading small amount of money to gain 10% a day. but that is another story and strategy.  
  
all we need is to get 1% a day _consistently_. whether it is with 15 pips, 20 pips, 30 pips a day ......... for 1% a day.  
the power of cumulative compounding will turn $10k to $2mil in 2 years.  
there is no hurry, unless we do not have the patience to wait for 2 years.

Golden words. This is the only correct approach to trading if you are a private trader.

No genius mate, just logic and common sense. I know a channel strategy when I see one. Point take though, all the best to you

You are wrong, I'm not winning today ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
My account is small so the gain is big.   
But maybe thats biggest problem. Small account and I don't care about it like I should.  
  
I think I have a problem with overtrading.  
I know the idea of compouding very well and thats my goal to achive.  
I have over 10 years of experience in Forex but most of this time it was only theoretical and in my example when it comes to real trading I get little confused.  
Need to practice, practice, practice.  
Do You have some tips when You have a bad day? How many trades is max?

**How many trades is max?**  
maybe limit to 2 trades per session. 2 for london session. 2 for new york session.  
if we think in term of percentage win/loss per day, then we get rid of the number of trades per day.  
there is no magic formula. each of us has to find our comfort zone.  
say we decide on 1% win per day and with equity of $10k.  
decide the number of pips that suits yourself for your strategy ..... 15 pips, 20 pips, 25 pips .........  
say 15 pips. then use about $7 per pip (10 divide by 15). if you are not comfortable then adjust.  
that will be $105 which is 1% of $10k plus or minus.  
20 pips will be $5 per pip.  
25 pips will be $4 per pip ..... etc .....  
  
**when You have a bad day?**  
for some it will be difficult to get consistent 1% day.  
we can look in term of 5% week or 20% month instead.  
we limit the % loss per day according to our own comfort zone.  
  
provided we have a win rate of 70%, the following is an example.  
limit 3% loss per day.  
win 1% - stop trading with 1 trade per day. target achieved.  
loss 1% - double next trade lot unit to 2% (if win stop trading)  
loss 3% - stop trading with max 2 trades per day.  
  
of course this will not suit every one. each of us has to find our own comfort zone.

another tip is to trade multi time frame in order to limit the number of trades.  
in the example i am using h1 and m15.  
  
i am only allowed to look for trade if:  
1\. the h1 fractal (a) is breached.  
2\. then i draw the trend line (b). anything below i only sell.  
3\. discard trade if highest fractal (c) is breached.  
4\. switch to m15 from vertical line (d) onward.  
5\. in m15 start looking for trade if there is lower low lower high 1234.  
  
divergences helped in the example.

The principle of constructing FСP projection lines is shown in detail in post #1.  
For grafical building, I do not use the MT4 platform, only to open/close positions on one of my accounts.  
All my charts that you see in the thread are screenshots of my charts in the Ensign Windows or Ensign 10 terminal.

a [reminder](https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/post/12923539#post12923539) that:  
  
trading can be as simple (if only you let it be) as 123:  
1\. drawing the trend line in h4 or h1 then  
2\. the channel in m15 or m5  
3\. and the wait for pullback entry.

Personally I use limit bracket orders, I feel it is the safest and most comfortable for me when scalping.

can use limit order for higher time frame as more room for stop loss.  
for scalping m5 or m1, i prefer to enter at the close of a strong candle.

exit trade when candle closes below today's low.  
because by then you will probably see a lower high and under the trend line.

If you follow volumes, always pay attention to the behavior of the volume at the time of the channel breakout.

Been away from trading for a while due to a lot of uncontrolled events in our lives. Also lost all of my indicators, ea's, etc. that I had saved for several years...another story. Decided to see what has happened since I was last on FF, and came across this thread which complements my trading beliefs...TL, S/R, pull-backs, and fibos. Thank you Seysin32 for sharing your knowledge, experience, and specifics to your method of trading. Since I am at page 1 of the thread, it will take me a while to digest and catch-up. As I move forward from page to page, is it appropriate to ask question that may already have been answered past the point which I have progressed? If not, then I will simply jot my questions down and move forward hoping to find answers.  
  
Thanks again Seysin32 for sharing,   
Tx15

Thanks for the kind welcome. I will certainly ask questions when they arise. I will be on page 1 for several days as there is a lot to understand and absorb. My learning style requires me to 1st just read without a high degree of understanding, then re-read at a slower pace with a better understanding, and finally re-read for the 3rd time with hopefully a high degree of understanding to the extent I could ask legitimate questions. Later, Tx15

after the previous day high was broken, it was tested twice

So I assume you are using the reaction at the .618 as your signal, can you confirm?

Usually this is Trigger-Line 1 or 2 (1.000 or 78.6-75.0 Fibo). In this case (m1 scalp) I use volume and channel breakout.

Evening Seysin32, I have been studying 4-6 hours a day primarily on page 1 since last Tuesday. I am now in the process of going back in time and practicing on drawing the TL, channel after TL is broken, and displaying fibos. I have discovered that after locating point 1 and 2, it is often necessary to make TL adjustments primarily at point 1. Also, as shown in the attached chart, it is also necessary to adjust the initial TL break either up or down depending on direction of trend. I have been staying on the 1H charts as you suggested; however, at some point in time when I'm demo trading on current charts, I will drop down to place trades on the 5/15M charts. The attached chart also showed regular bearish divergence which I failed to draw.   
  
Thanks again for sharing. As I mentioned in my first post, I am somewhat familiar with your approach to making deals, but was never able to really put it all together like you have in your trading method.  
  
Later,  
Tx15

I believe the attached chart is an example of when the TL is not accurately drawn. It becomes clear that's the case when after the TL is broken, then nothing on the fibs align properly and everything heads south. Will practice some more tomorrow, as I'm tired tonight and ready for my nightly Jack & coke.

Thanks Inthebox, I just now noticed where you had posted your perspective. So based on the LH and LL, the trend has changed and I should be essentially trying to find deals in the opposite direction than the deal I posted. Is that correctly stated?  
  
Thank you, as your perspective is what I'm seeking and appreciate,

my thought process:  
1\. support (higher time frame better).  
2\. 4 points of H, HH, L, HL. (in lower time frame)  
3\. find a trend line that cuts through a strong candle

Thank you Seysin32 for your input. I am still reading, studying, and trying to gain a comfortable grasp on your trading method. Since _I am only looking at the 1H charts_ by going back in time to practice drawing the TL, that will be the only charts I post. If I draw the channels and the fib projections based on the width of the channels, your readers will think that I am trading these setups, where in reality, I am only practicing hypothetical setups on the 1H charts. When I do decide to post the additional method components (channels and fibs), I will post the 1H charts showing only the break in TL, and then drop down to the 5 or 15M charts to actually draw the channel and fib. I would hence be using the HTF, the 1H, for determining the current trend for taking deals on the lower TF's.   
  
I am trying my best to learn your method as outlined on page 1. I have added the volume indicator to my template, as I know the importance of its use for making deals. I use the MACD primarily for divergence. In addition, after the TL has been broken, I normally would seek retraces back to the 100 or 75/78.6 levels, and accompanied by setup candles as you described before actually entering a position on the 5 or 15M charts.   
  
As I've said before, your trading method includes the components that I believe in, but was unable to organize them consistently as you have presented. Thanks!!!

You have the right approach. Take your time and do not worry that readers will think of your branches publications. You do it for yourself.

The 1st attachment shows the upward TL being broken on the 1H chart, which supports making short deals.  
The 2nd attachment shows the channel and fibs being drawn on a 15M chart and a possible short being taken based on the 1H HTF.

Evening Seysin32. If you get a chance, would you provide some input on how you would trade this chart development? I understand that skipping it without any consideration is also an option.  
  
Thanks, Tx15

Inthebox,  
  
When price breaks out of the wedge, where do you measure the width for drawing the fibs and setting the correct number of pips between 0 and 100?

for day trading, 25 pips for 1% gain is good enough for me.  
as many touches of fib channel lines as possible (3 circled).

Hello.  
Sorry to answer late. I was busy. Hope with your wife will be fine.  
Let's take a look at your example. I prepared the charts yesterday, and as I see today the situation has not changed significantly.  
So, imagine that we only have the H1 chart.

What do you think of this? I did not take this trade because there wasn't a higher high on price action that corresponded with the lower MACD. Price kinds of trails off above the trend line. However everything else looks good.

Evening again Seysin32, as it is 6 pm cst,  
  
Thank you for such a clear and informative response on your post #1348. I have studied the charts you posted several times, and I will certainly add this post to the archive that I'm maintaining. In addition, since I'm not that familiar with the accumulation area you alluded to, I will concentrate on your FCP method of TL, BO, channel, fib projection, levels 100 and 75/78.6, and TP's at 38.2 and 0.00. Those trade deals develop daily.   
  
Thanks for your comment regarding my wife. The doctor discharged her today, and she is now resting peacefully as it is almost impossible to get any quality rest in a hospital setting.   
  
Going back to page 1. Will re-read again, as each time I gain additional insight as how to successfully trade the FCP method.  
  
Thanks again,  
Tx15

Morning Seysin32,  
  
The deals you made on the 1M E/U were beautiful as they developed. What TF chart or charts were you watching before you moved to the 1M chart for making the deals? Or were you watching only the 1M E/U chart?  
  
Thanks for response,

Hello.  
I use the H1 charts (only the current candle), m5, m1 and a tick chart with Heikin-Ashi candles.  
Since all the charts are displayed on my monitors at the same time, I see the whole situation at once.

Thanks Seysin32 for your response.  
  
How many ticks do you use on the HA candles chart? I have observed the monitor setup that you have shown...very impressive. I have only one MT4 monitor setup, and have always felt as though I needed to upgrade my trading hardware.  
  
Thanks for all that you have shared on your FCP method,  
Tx15

Hi Seysin32,  
  
I'm new to this thread. Still learning from you by reading what you have taught us here. Attached is Straits Time Index. Would you be able to comment if I plot the FCP correctly? Thanks in advance.

After reading this thread further, I think I may have plot point 1 wrongly. Here's my revised FCP. Hope you could comments. Thanks.

My workstation consists of three monitors 27 "each (for this I have a powerful video card on my computer). Now this size is redundant for me, 24" is fine. Thus, I can see at the same time all the charts that I use in trading. As for the tick chart, this is a 99 tick chart. The candle fills in about 1.5 to 3 minutes. Combined with Heikin Ashi candlesticks, this gives a clear picture (no noise) of micro-trends for scalping. See example below:

In terms of indices and stocks, these are charts with a lot of gaps. This can cause inaccuracies in the building of the FCP model. In addition, channels are often broken with a gap. What to do if the channel is broken with a gap, I will write about this later.

A practice FCP position on EUR/USD 15M that I took this morning. I confirmed the direction by looking at the 1H HTF. Per Seysin32's method, once the TL was broken, I drew the channel, the fib projection based on the width of the channel, and waited for the right setup with supporting volume. Regular divergence, which I didn't show was also supporting the position I placed. I believe the key to taking this successful position was the correct setup candles retracing back to the 75/78.6 levels.

Evening Seysin32,  
  
I have read page 1 three times along with all of the posts that you have included. In addition, I have now read all of the thread posts up to page 70. I will start tomorrow from page 1, dedicate as much time as it requires, and then proceed to read and study all of the thread posts up through the current page. Any questions that I have during this period of time will be asked on your thread. I will continue to post charts with explanations as I move forward.  
  
Thanks again for sharing your FCP method...I love it,  
Tx15

Mantra of a successful trader.  
1\. A winning trader picks his _time_ and _place_ of combat where the odds are in his favor.  
2\. Be _alert_ to both potential opportunities and dangers.  
3\. Have the _patience_ to wait and the _decisiveness_ to strike.  
  
Everything is difficult at first.  
With time and practice, it will all become clear.  
A battle does not determine the result of the war.

Evening Inthebox,  
  
The mantra you stated in post #1394 is a truism in my personal opinion. As a retired educator in the public school system of America, I believe that your country was referred to at one time as the Garden State...correct me if I'm wrong. Regardless, I appreciate the valuable input that you have provided to this thread. I am still learning Seysin32's FCP method. Thank you for sharing your knowledge and experience as it relates to the FCP method of making deals and placing trades.  
  
Looking forward to a very positive trading week for all that believe and apply the FCP method of trading,  
Tx15

we had just celebrated our 55th birthday on 9aug.  
a month ago, we had elected the same ruling party since inception for the 15th consecutive term in government.  
the same party that turned the country from a swarm land with no natural resources (except human brains) to a city state in such a short period of time.

If the gap breaks the channel, connect the candle close in the channel and the open candle outside the channel.  
Place the Fibo projection at the intersection of this line and the TL. I found two examples from my archive and one recent USOil example.

you used fcp at the top of channel?  
if so, then this can be applied at both extremes of a range.

Results on the EUR/USD 15M chart. I place emphasis on all that Seysin32 and Inthebox have shared with us. Spend time on the TL and adjust as necessary...this is the basis for the FCP method. Draw an inaccurate TL and nothing else lines up appropriately. I concentrate on several factors after the TL has been drawn. PA of points 1 and 2 in order to establish point 3. High volume is a key to placing a deal. Divergence is nice to have, but not absolutely necessary. I also believe that the setup candles play a big role in making a successful trade...this takes patience, and some trades are lost, but I still emphasize the importance. I most often wait for a retrace back to the 75/78.6 level before considering a position. I always look at HTFs to confirm trend direction.  
  
If I have misstated anything, then please correct me. I am still learning and will continue to learn for quite some time.  
  
Thanks again for the FCP method,  
Tx15

my take on eurusd.  
3 opportunities today. 2 sell and 1 buy. buy is counter trend.  
the h4 tells me that it is a sell day because price is under the 2 trend lines.  
1\. sell at range or below day open.  
2\. buy above trend line and previous day low.  
3\. sell below day open and trend line.

the retrace already happened at fib 100 and 75 and was subtle.  
lower time frame should be clearer.

Thanks Inthebox for your input as it is appreciated and noted...another post that I have archived.   
  
I apply HTF analysis to all positions before hitting the button.

On this chart, there was a deal based on Fibonacci projections on the percentage expansion of the daily opening.  
We haven't talked about this method here. I'm not ready to talk about it yet. I need time.

Hi,  
  
Thank you. would you give us the two answers. I would like to learn more about this method as I am currently practicing it and any more details would help a lot.

just put your effort to mastering 4 things.  
1\. support/resistance (supply/demand)  
2\. trend line  
3\. divergence  
4\. fibonacci  
  
mantra 1.  
a winning trader picks his _time_ (new york session) and _place_ (price near fib 78, and below day open line, previous day high, trend line) of combat where the odds are in his favor (divergence).  
  
sr flip at trend line.

Hi Seysin,  
  
Pardon me if you have mentioned this before. May I know the EMA/WMA setting for 1min chart? It seem different from the 48EMA/120WMA in which I am aware of.

When the price instead of TP1 reaches the level of 0.236, then if it falls below, in most cases it will reach the level of 1.146 instead of TP2.

Seysin - When would you target beyond the 1.146 to the 1.382, 1.5, and 1.618?

Hello.  
To assess the potential for moving beyond TP2, you need to look in the context of HTF. Also, see how price reacts to your projection lines - breaks and moves on, or can't break. Price makes higher highs (or lower lows) or not. Note that if the projection is confirmed and the price recognizes the Fib levels, in most cases the price will reach the opposite of the lowest/highest levels of the projection (from 1.382 low to 1.382 high, 1.618-1.618 or 2.000-2.000). As a rule, everything beyond TP2 is a bonus. I close part of the position on TP2, and move the rest part to BE and release.

Seysin32,   
  
When you begin your day of looking for deals, what chart TF do you begin with before any other analysis? I'm still on page 1 for the fourth time, but once I'm finished this time, then progress should improve considerably. Is is ok to ask your time zone? My schedule is flexible, so when I really need to ask a question, I can do so when you are up and about.  
  
Thanks again for sharing the FCP method with us,  
Tx15

You can write to me at any time. If I am at the monitor, I will answer, if I am not, then there is no answer. Let me remind you that I wrote earlier that I do not recommend starting the study of FСP with trading on m1. I start the day by noting the timing of important news to come. Then I look at H1 what has happened in the intervening time. Since I am doing scalping, I am interested in micro-trends. All charts above 5-15 minutes are useless for this. Next, I look at how the price interacted with the daily opening line and the behavior of the volume on m1 (a minute chart can tell a lot). Finally, I define micro-trends using 5m and a tick chart.

Seysin, two questions about this setup (I didn't take it)   
  
1) The volume increases with the candle coming out of the channel, then the next candle goes back in the channel, would this be a red flag for you to not take the deal?   
  
2) Do you see an entry here? There is a wick at the retest candle at the .786, but the trigger candle closes at the 0.382 so I don't see a way to enter.   
  
Again can't thank you enough for your continued patience and excellent instruction.

1\. In itself, the return of the candle to the channel is not a signal.  
2\. Yes, here was a good scalp setup .  
I used a projection on my chart to see the setup better. Candle # 1 breaks through the channel and is accompanied by the most significant volume for today. Candle # 2 - up, the volume falls. Candle 3 - even lower, the volume increases, closes below the line of the daily opening (dashed white). Candle wick # 4 for trigger 2 - confirmation. While writing the answer, the situation has developed, nevertheless TP2 has been achieved exactly - about 13p. I would enter at the close of candle # 3, and close at TP2.

While I was writing to you, I missed a deal on eurusd (nothing wrong) ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f605.png?v=15.1).  
A very similar situation, net 25p.

I wanted to get your opinion on this trade that I took. I took this on the m5 but was concerned that it was breaking out of almost an 8 hour channel. It looked good on the m15 except I couldn't get the EMAs to go in my favor on that time frame, going all the way down to a 8 & 13 EMA.

Hello!  
I built a channel wider (too narrow projection to moving for almost 8 hours).  
The deal was quite reasonable for a scalp, you could take about 20p, which you did.  
But, I probably wouldn't have taken it... Why?   
1\. End of the European session + Friday.  
2\. I lacked cogency at the highs before the channel breakout.

Seysin, thank you very much for taking the time for such a detailed analysis. Would you mind elaborating on point 2? Are you looking for the top of the price to be seen with a lower MACD at that particular spot. I was comparing the MACD with a higher peak much lower in the channel per my illustration. I am always trying to learn. Thanks again!

There are many methods on FF.  
And I'm glad you find this thread helpful. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f642.png?v=15.1)  
FCP is simple and effective, but it is not science, more art.

Seysin32,  
  
I concur with JiveTrader. You do an excellent job explaining, and your graphics are always crystal clear and never confusing. You can't imagine how much that helps us guys as we strive to learn you FCP method.  
  
You are certainly appreciated,

I was also looking at that GBP/NZD H1 instrument last night. I probably would have taken it if I was at my computer. However it didn't work. Any analysis as to why would be appreciated. This is how I saw it:

gbpnzd on hindsight.  
1\. fundamental - dovish fomc affecting the commodity currencies.  
[https://www.futurecurrencyforecast.c...n-loonie-48514](https://www.futurecurrencyforecast.com/pound-to-canadian-dollar-gbp-cad-exchange-rate-holds-steady-as-dovish-fed-outlook-weighs-on-loonie-48514)  
2\. technical - missed out the htf support zone and trend line with divergence. however price is approaching a supply zone.  
  
in the above case, risks in day trading in smaller time frame could be mitigated by partial tp1 and put the balance to BE+.

AUD/CAD H1  
  
So I took this trade last night, based on the above post I drew the channel wrong. Below is the chart that I used to enter, I took 1/3 off at the TP1, then there was a nice reaction at the .236 so I was going to move my SL lower and ride is down to TP3.

So while waiting for this to hit TP3 I see Seysin's post and realize I probably built this channel incorrectly, and if my redraw is correct then it hit TP2 perfectly and I should get out. So I closed my trade in profit.

I hope I drew the 2nd one right, I think I did, seems like closing it was the right choice.   
  
Thanks for everything Seysin, your continued support of this thread is greatly appreciated.

I am no Seysin or InTheBox but I would have not taken this trade for the following reasons:   
  
1) No volume increase out of channel  
2) No MA Cross, MA's are against you.   
3) No wave failure pattern.

first of all i do not trade pairs like eurgbp, and the other one is audnzdcad.  
i am trying to make sense of what happened in eurgbp and would like to share on mtf MA cross (8/21 ema) and fractals.  
  
1\. w1 ema 8 above 21. 21 point slightly up with hh hl. possible hidden divergence forming.  
2\. d1 ranging. ema twisting.  
3\. h4 ema 8 below 21. but 21 flat with no lh ll. 8 pointing up and price above it.  
4\. h1 when price closed above trend line. ema 8 below 21. but 21 flat. 8 pointing up and price above it.  
regular divergence forming. good for exiting short trades.  
5\. m15 when price broke up above fractal high then the channel, volume was increasing.  
regular divergence formed. ema 8 above 21. 21 pointing up and price above 8. macd above zero.  
so it would be good that fcp channel only be drawn when conditions favor in that particular time frame and tp1 2 3 according to it.

NZD/USD m5 Scalp.   
Took this trade after the above trade went to TP1 and moved the rest of my SL to BE. I don't like to be in correlated trades unless I split up the risk or move the SL to BE in one of them.

Friends!  
I stop publishing here and leave FF. Maybe I will rarely appear here to read what I need. I said everything I wanted to say, but my trade continues. Our main goal in trading is to be consistent. And then even 10p per day will be enough for us. This is my trading philosophy. Those who have spent many years in front of the monitor will understand me. We don't have to live to trade. On the contrary, trade should help us in life. If we spend many hours sitting in front of the monitor, we lose another part of our life. This is our family, friends, communication, sun, sky and movement. I wish everyone here all the best. Thank you friends. Take care of yourself and loved ones.  
Yours Sey.

Seysin32,  
  
I fully understand and appreciate the words in your last post. You are an intelligent person, and most definitely have life's priorities in the right order. Thanks for sharing with all of us your FCP method of making deals.   
  
You take care of yourself, your family, and all that you love,

Seysin,  
  
I guess every banquet must come to an end.  
I have enjoyed my time here that I am part of this seeding, planting and watering.  
What we have no control of is the growth of what was planted.  
  
I am glad to have come to know you at this cross road of my life journey.  
For I can see that you are a man of principle, that I can say.  
  
If that is your photo, hey handsome man.

Hey Seysin,  
  
In the off chance you are still monitoring this thread I have a question for you.   
  
I have been working the FCP with success for the past couple of months and have noticed that if I move the time frames around to find the volume candle out of the channel the model seems to work. For example if I am looking at a setup on the M15 but the volume candle out of the channel is not there I move to the M12 and see it clearly, then if the other FCP parameters are there the deal works. I also see many when moving around from the M5 to the M3.   
  
In your opinion is this valid or am I just getting lucky (especially on the M3)? Any input would be greatly appreciated.

Hello, friends. Thank you for your interest.  
There is nothing secret here. It's just that if you don't have scalping experience or are not familiar with FСP, it won't do you any good.  
This will be another useless information. I wrote a little higher [![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f51d.png?v=15.1)](https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/post/13287810#post13287810)

If it will be useless information, why is there a password to it?? Why can we not decide? Why is it such a battle to share the password?? Is this a reversal psychology sales trick? Do you want money for the password????????- This is bizarre /fishy, come to think of it.!!

Yes, you are right, this is very suspicious. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f9d0.png?v=15.1)  
Imagine that I did not post any information in the archive, this will remove unnecessary thoughts from you.  
After all, I don't owe you anything, just like you do me, do you?  
I have posted this information in the archive, just as a small addition to the FСP. But people come who have not published a single post in this thread, not a single chart with FСP. Well, you don't need FСP, not a single scalping chart according to your method. And they demand something from me... Friends, this is not done. Please, understand me correctly and not be offended. If I have time, I will open a new thread dedicated to FPDO scalping. And then you will be able to fully prove yourself as a like-minded person. We'll see.

Dude let the man manage his thread however he chooses, he explained his reasons and instead of putting the effort of learning the basic method first you want shortcuts, and those won't get you far in trading (or life) anyway, think about it.

Hello community and [Seysin32](https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/seysin32) (Thank you for posting this, looks promising)!  
  
Unforuntaly, I am using a Mac and don't easily have access to mt4 and therefore cannot download the settings easily. Do you mind sharing the fibo levels for the channel and entry/stop/takeprofits for tradingview! Much appreciated.  
  
Would like to backtest/forward test this ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

damn it, there are trillion information in this thread, I have read it, digest it dozen times. You ask question that are the basis of the methods that you can easy find scrolling back... if you can do this simple work, you will just loose money, over and over again, until you do your homework... sorry dude but that is reality, this method is explained with precision you could only dream of... if you cannot find it no one can help you...  
  
oh and btw, the OP dont use MT4 for charting this method, it show how much you read :-)

Nice one, congrats for you ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Anyhow, I am aware OP doesn't use MT4, however there are some posts where people are using mt4 - from what I gathered, the fib channel levels are 0, .25, .5, 1... Maybe my post was misunderstood, I was simply wanting to confirm the levels before I try it for myself. I never discredited the explanation of the method :-) In fact, I want to thank Seysin32 for writing a nice clear method with many examples! Afterall, this is a community of sharing and learning..

it took me one hour to refresh my memory by reading post#1 and every links in it.  
but it will take years to build up knowledge and experience.  
  
from post #1.  
"First, the money is brought not by the system itself, but by _experience and knowledge_. Secondly, it is not completely free. You will _pay_ for it with your diligence, discipline and hours of training in front of your monitor. He, who is ready to make an effort, will receive the result.  
The FCP system is based on a graphic display of the psychology of market participants, expressed in the interaction of prices with TL and Fibonacci levels. At the heart of FCP is the idea that the price, breaking out of a diagonal/horizontal channel or triangle, travels a distance equal to the projection of the FIBO levels on the channel width. We will start with the FIBO projection from the diagonal channel, built from the trend line, since this is the basis."  
  
in a nutshell, look for impulsive, corrective waves or trend, pullback in higher time frame.  
look for the same thing in lower time frame ---> break of trend line, channel, support/resistance, pullback, wait for signal candle at specific fibonacci level.  
the channel is not permanently fixed, it has to be adjusted accordingly to the later development of price action. eg. the former has been negated because the lowest fractal had been taken out or price had been oscillating many times at the trend line.  
  
the whole thing can be subjective due to further incorporating of our own different knowledge and experiences like moving average, support/resistance, divergences, etc etc .........

This is the post I orinigally saw, out of curiosity as I tried both positive and negative inputs, does it make a difference? Visually on the charts, it doesn't. Thank you also for you constructive comments back.

show me your chart on the two fib channels.  
when you do, you will remember better.  
also snap the setting box like i did above.

So I'll give a visual example as that is how I learn best. In no way am I saying this is right, but it is an attempt ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

1) I connected the trendline as seen between point 1 and 2.  
2) Now as for point 3, reading through the posts and examples, I'm aware there is a way to approach it, however, I am still waiting for that 'aha' or lightbulb moment - With practice fingers crossed ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)The way I justified point 3 is with the impulse, however, it has me conflicted with #Post 19 posted by OP..Any way to see it differently/ is it already correct ?

pt 3 is ok.  
extend the fib ext for tp plus if you want to.  
remember the down channel is just a pullback from higher time frame.  
  
which sentence in post 19 or image connected that you saw the conflict?

Thanks for the feedback.  
  
As for point 3, the confusion I have is when do I put point 3 to the bottom line or the middle line of the fib channel if that makes sense?  
  
For the fib extension, I am using the channel width, should I reconfigure the fib ext values? I'm not sure which one to use as many posts have different ones.  
  
As for the sleep, haha, yes indeed, I'm a late night owl ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Nice pullback on the 4H.  
  
Narrowed down to the 30m, but in this case screenshot is on 1H for better visual.  
Point 1 and 2 connected as seen with point 3 at an impulse..  
Waiting for price to give me a nice pattern candle either at 0.75/0.786 or at 1.  
  
Is this correct?  
  
Edit: Didn't take the trade at 0.75/0.786 when a nice pinbar formed as news was coming out..So far waiting to see if any reaction off the 1.

my fib ext setting.  
  
pt 3 can be on any of the 4 lines of the fib channel, whether from pt 1 or 2.  
the best is trying to touch as many fractals on the lines as per green up arrows.  
[https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...6#post13296826](https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/post/13296826#post13296826)  
the placement of pt 3 would also depend on your TP expectations.  
the wider the channel, the higher TP you would expect.

So just out of curiosity, if you are able to show and post setups for a month with a net gain, you get access?

May I suggest you not task Seysin with these type of questions and add volume to your charts as previously explained. Even if he was to post that information it would mean nothing, you are not him.   
  
Forexnub - everything is about you, how you feel, how you process information, how you execute. From your first trade to your last. The reckoning - to put things in order, you got to put them in order they aren’t going to get in order for you. Your opponent has no face. Everything is about the process you take just like everyone else.

i am here to guide even if there is only one person interested.  
simply because i know this method works.  
if there's no one, i will be out of here.  
everything's laid out, the set up, stop loss, entry, take profit.  
just trade with trend.  
there is no hurry to trade.  
what is required is patience to wait for pullback to the level/location.  
leave the counter trend to the experienced.

Friends, I made a decision to remove the scalping add-on archive.  
This caused the unnecessary effect of chasing the Grail, I did not expect it. This caused unwanted activity and useless conversations on this thread.  
In addition, I receive letters, people began to demand access and even accuse me of selling information, etc. Maybe I will open a new thread for the Fibonacci projection for daily opening (FPDO) scalping method. However, since my time is limited, I will be giving information in thread gradually.  
Thank you for understanding.

Progress of the FСP scalp model, all goals are achieved exactly (potential remains):

Could this be a potential setup? Is there any effect on the trade if price drops sharply?  
Looking for a retest of .786/.75 or 1.  
  
edit: Reasons for trade is that it's near a supply zone, divergence, and perhaps a re-test of trendline on HTF.

Form just a setup perspective of what you have on your chart, the back end of your fibo's are well beyond the 1.618 so this would be a large red flag that your channel is incorrect. The bottom end of your Fibos are a mess, see below for a FCP setup of Fibo Retracement on TradingView

Hey appreciate it, I spoke about this with inthebox in the previous posts, why is my bottom end of my fibo a mess? I have the same as you, just don't have the -0.5, 1.5 and 1.236 (for top of fib).  
  
Entry still remains at 1 or 0.786/0.75 and profit levels at TP1 (0.382), TP2 (0), and TP3 (-0.382)..which remains consistent with OP's fib. By the way this is not a dig, just trying to understand and learn of course ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
edit: Reflecting on the first part of your post, I see what you mean with the 1.618, appreciate it.

for me, if the pullback is v shaped, i would not be interested in selling.  
if there's slow wavering then i would be interested in selling.

quite common to see range after trend line break.  
in this case, there are two.

Question, when you're looking for a setup, what are the things you are looking for? For example, in an uptrend, do you try to see whether there are two lows for TL, connect them followed by a HH,LH,HL,LL and break of TL?

drawing of trend line.  
when fractal 2 break, draw trend line from 1 to 3.  
you can have outer trend line B, inner trend line A.  
when inner trend line breaks, price tend to go for outer trend line, or a fractal.  
  
to be continued .....

same application when looking at h1.  
only when you are able to draw a trend line, there's a trend only in that particular time frame you are looking at.  
there could be a trend in h1 but not h4.  
  
when a trend line is broken, there is no trend yet when no fractal has been broken.  
price could range or could go back into the broken trend line.  
  
so that's how one can interpret when there's a trend or range in a particular time frame.  
  
however, drawing FCP is different from drawing a trend line.

I'm still a unsure about this though. Would the break of fractal 2 be where I placed the green circles and then price closing below the HL fractal (green square) and then coming to retest it?

if the cue from previous 2 days is to be taken, the break out of the box is around european session.

quick short day trade result during asia session.  
just repeat looking for set ups in european session and/or new york session.  
2 winning sessions per day is more than enough.

this time gbp.  
you see the big blue candle.  
that's an exhausting candle.  
the latter upward momentum died off slowly, compared to initial, it's nowhere near.  
and eventually has to fall.

@Seysin32  
I've been following this thread for some time now, great work you have put up so far. Where the experience comes in is the subjectivity involved in drawing the fibonnaci channels, but with more practice, there'll be more winnable trades.  
  
Kindly help look into AUDJPY, i guess a sell trade is playing out already. _B_ ut for the sake of continued learning, please help analyse with a chart.

Appreciate the help and resources. Every time there is a break of a higher fractal in an uptrend situation, you draw/readjust your trendline if necessary until TL?  
  
Is there any other FCP resources/videos I can look at? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

whenever fractal breaks, trend line is drawn.  
some previous trend line will be made redundant, some will remain as inner trend line.  
when inner trend line breaks, price gravitates to the next nearest trend line, until the last outer trend line.

Ok, so for example in the situations below; The trendlines will be drawn/re-adjusted until a break?

there are 3 trend lines.  
when 1 is broken, expect price to move to 2.  
when 2 is broken, expect price to move to 3.  
  
but trading is not so simple.  
there are many factors involved like strength of momentum, support/resistance, etc.  
  
so it's up to individual to apply FCP around which particular trend line.  
to increase the chance, choose one around SR, fib level, divergence ....... etc ....

i do not trade 2 commodity currencies as pair.  
it could be a 3rd touch bounce. mostly blue candles.  
sell only when h4 close below trend line.

do the simplest thing.  
short term intra day trading is 20 pips for 1% return.  
one in asia session.  
one in europe session.  
maybe another in new york session (my worst record).  
  
no fear. no greed.

Why don’t you like trading two commodity currencies as a pair?

i see aud,nzd,cad under one group (commodity, agriculture, natural resources), eur,gbp under another (most time complimentary).  
i rather trade the first vs the second group, rather than trade among those in the same group.  
the atr can be 3 times as much.

I always seem to be on the wrong side of the trade. As silly as it sounds, how do I know which side to put the channel? I personally, when I see a HH,HL,HH etc. for an uptrend or vice versa for a downtrend, I try to go with the trend and only use the channel on the retracement of the HH (in an uptrend). As logical as this sounds, I always seem to be wrong.  
  
Here is my thought on GBPUSD:  
I see price in a downward channel approaching a trendline, resistance, and divergence. Ignore price action after the trendline (that was the next day when I woke up).. I will address that below.

Next, I narrow down to the 15m to see price action better. There is a break of the channel which I suppose is a false one and continues going up.

Today: I redrew the channel but now it has passed the trendline, but still has resistance + rsi divergence on the 1H. However now I am conflicted because of the break of the trendline but also on the higher timeframes, the trend seems to have changed to an uptrend (HH,HL,HH)..

at times cannot help that the momentum is too strong.  
after the fact analysis using higher time frames d1, h4, h1.  
  
trend can be seen using:  
1\. hh hl  
2\. trend line  
3\. moving average

If I observe right and by seeing your other posts, you usually tend to counter trade the trend?

If you read back in this thread InTheBox said something to the effect that as traders we get to pick the time and place of our trade. I just look for areas of resistance on the larger time frame and then go down to see if there is a FCP model. Then when that is identified look for entry signals e.g. volume, trigger candles, divergences, etc.

If you could be so kind to review this ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
  
EUR/USD:  
Finally a break of the highs after a few weeks and a retest of the zone. HH's,HL'S,HH's: bias is buys.

What I learned: CHECK THE NEWS. News is revolving now around USD and I was trading EUR/USD. Another tip for myself is maybe wait for another HH and HL, rather then taking a trade-off the first retest of the broken support now resistance.

a. news

i see that you are trading m1, m5. i assume that you are short term day trading.  
  
1\. no matter what time frame you are trading in, begin your analysis with d1.  
2\. d1 trend line tells me it's uptrend. i see nearest support but i can't see any resistance.  
3\. go to w1 to find resistance. then refine it in d1. there is still room for price to go up to resistance.  
  
even before looking at your analysis, i have done the above. my bias is to buy.

channel width can be redrawn smaller according to one's profit expectation.  
or remain taking tp1 as profit.  
in the example, entry at 100 offered about 20 pips at tp1.  
there was a 2nd chance entry at 78.6.

Fantastic explanations and the subsequent posts after, appreciate it. On the outlook, it looks like I took the correct approach from looking at your feedback and comments, however, I could improve by still being able to realign the channel and see if there is still an opportunity for entry instead of throwing away the whole trade.   
  
Secondly, as you mentioned:

Nice to see I took the same trade (although I took mine off the 75/78 zone), albiet not on the same time chart. However, my channel was a bit smaller; the bottom being at the bearish impulse.  
Also I noticed you enter quite early? You don't wait for a retest?

In this case, it is rather an exception, I usually wait for a retest. I have several charts giving me information for the scalp.

nice trades above ^.  
  
I saw the same set-up above and wanted to enter (long) aswell for EUR/USD. Bias was uptrend looking at D1 trend - narrowed down to lower time frames to see pull back into resistance area + divergence and therefore it looked like a good setup to go long.

I am looking at GBP/USD (waiting for news at 12pm).  
  
Uptrend on D1 - bias is to buy.  
Pullback is approaching resistance + trendline + rsi divergence.  
  
ps. I am a little skeptical due to the new strain covid news revolving around U.K, therefore I'll see how it plays out.  
Is this a good approach?  
  
edit: Plus strong bullish day for USD so far?

Sorry to ask but could you elaborate or explain which candle? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f605.png?v=15.1)  
  
I agree with the bullishness, (checking my screenshot), it looked like a good buy but rolled the otherway.

bounce at confluence of trend line and support and round number 1.32.  
if in doubt, place a smaller amount.

Yup, I have the same outlook.  
Thanks, was just verifying if my thought process aligns with yours for example or I am completely off.

the first 2 bot did not bounce up the trend line, making a small loss.

from now to year end, if we are still trading, trade with smaller units.  
as more people going on leave, the market is getting thin, just need a few institutions to create havoc.

I expected the bounce because of the overall uptrend, trendline and structure support. It is also a QM pattern. I didnt notice the round number though.  
  
i was in a buy somewhere below the gap (dont ask me why ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f648.png?v=15.1)) but decided to hold and closed at profit... leap of faith!

if d1 closes below 1.31, there's room to fall 1,000 pips.

Wow. Well come back Seysin! I'm really happy. It was crazy year! But seems everything will be fine ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f64f.png?v=15.1)  
Trying something new. PSAR + MA100 + Fibo channel  
EJ in uptrend many days, so I decided to grab some pips on M1.  
Confirmations for buy:  
1\. Fibo channel broken  
2\. Price above MA100  
3\. PSAR indicating uptrend  
Not so clear entering. I still polishing this strategy.

EJ, m1  
**Mistakes**  
\- Not perfect enter. Miss fibo 100 & 78.6  
\- Not sure, but should come out on PSAR reversal indication on first wave (may be not, investigating)  
  
**Strategy**  
\- Not sure that PSAR is helpful ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)

mainly was your placement of point 3.  
  
FCP is used to give us as best an entry as possible with the TP. it's only one part of the story.  
the more important part is why we sold there?  
it looked like the trend was strong and sold on counter trend.  
why didn't we sell at a lower level, we could draw a channel there too?  
we could, depending how FCP was drawn. however the TP would be lesser, probably not hitting TP2.  
  
reasons:  
1\. round number 30400.  
2\. slowing of upward momentum. compare the 2 green arrows. shorter and not as steep.  
3\. double top.

Thanks for the feedback. So that I'm clear, you're stating that point three should have been at the arrow in the image? If so, is this because this is considered a strong push up?

20 point move in my favor then stopped out before tp1 was hit. Please advise if probabilities got me or if it was a bad entry.   
  
Note for some reason on my MT4, channels/trendlines adjust themselves as price moves so please refer to the original post for channel critique.

this is from post #1.  
"On the example of uptrend.  
Find the last Highest Low (or bottom preceding the last maximum peak). Draw a beam from this point to the left. The first bottom that touches line the will be the second point. You got our trend line. Build the channel so that one of the sides coincides with the TL. Usually we get point 3 by placing a max (min) swing on the midline of the channel, but the best place for the _point 3 would be a straight continuous movement as far as possible from point 1 or point 2_. Measure the vertical width of the channel and build a FIBO grid equal to this width. When the price leaves the channel, place the FIBO grid so that the line 1.000 passes through the breakdown point of the TL. Lines 0.382 and 0.000 will correspond to our TP. Look for an entry after closing the signal candle at 1.000. SL is usually a few points above the level of 1.000 or extension 1.272."  
  
choose point 3 that has as straight continuous movement whether it is from point 1 or point 2.  
so point 3 was at top of the pin bar.  
in this example, i do not consider it a strong move up as it could not close above the previous high.  
sometimes it could be a strong move over the previous high which may resulted as an exhausted move to take out retail stops.  
or it could result in trend continuation.

your FCP 3 points were misplaced.  
you need to reread post #1 and all the links in order to establish a proper foundation of drawing the channel.  
different ways of drawing channel can result in different levels of TPs.

counter trend trading per d1 chart, would be wiser to take tp1 as profit.

Hello and welcome!  
  
I am also in the process of learning (nearly 1 month) and thankful to Inthebox and Seysin32 for continuous teaching and mentoring when they can.  
Looking back on your posts, the best way, at least for me is through trial and error and chart time - however of course understanding the fundementals of the strategy which can be found on the first few pages of this thread with further examples throughout. For me, a recent help was on page 83 - specifically Inthebox comments!  
  
Goodluck and a happy new year ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f917.png?v=15.1)

As we come to the end of year, this is my demo account results for FCP. I started on 16th of December 2020 with possibly skewed results in the first week trying to grasp the idea and continuously learning. This is not a full month and was only 9 trading days.  
  
However, the idea remains that I will forward test this continuously after the New Years for a least a couple of months and see if I can improve.  
Today I had a bad trading day for whatever reason losing 5 trades (5%) and winning one (0.84%, took 2/3 off to let position run but 1/3 got stopped out) - Possibly due to 'revenge' trading perhaps but goals will be set: for example max 2% loss per day etc..I would also like to improve win rate + RR. I usually don't like to monitor the trade and usually set a take-profit. However, I guess I will see when I have done 100+ trades.  
  
Was at one point as high as 10%+ and gave it back but still in the positive at 4.7% on the account.  
  
Lets see for next year and see if I can get the consistency![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f91e.png?v=15.1) Any suggestions, comparables, or words of wisdom would be great ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60b.png?v=15.1)

For me, a recent help was on page 83 - specifically Inthebox comments! Goodluck and a happy new year ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f917.png?v=15.1)

Using the midline for point 3 or the outer trend line is what's hanging me up. Sometimes it's one, sometimes it's the other. While not having the best grasp of this part yet, I still came out with positive points after my first two days trading this method. I think I took 7 total trades. Will keep plugging away.  
  
As for the reference to page 83 - there is no page 83. Please advise.  
  
Thanks for your feedback! 

Blessed is the one who takes refuge in Him.

say after getting a certain amount or % during the course of the week, 2 options, the latter may not suit everyone.  
1\. continue to be consistent in incremental return.  
2\. risking the profit made so far to make larger ones by increasing unit size.

FCP is used to give us as best an entry as possible with the TP. it's only one part of the story. the more important part is why we sold there? it looked like the trend was strong and sold on counter trend. why didn't we sell at a lower level, we could draw a channel there too? we could, depending how FCP was drawn. however the TP would be lesser, probably not hitting TP2. reasons: 1. round number 30400. 2. slowing of upward momentum. compare the 2 green arrows. shorter and not as steep. 3. double top....

Looking back on this, nice explanation!  
I don’t feel fully comfortable with taking counter trend trades at this time until I fully familiarise myself with the strategy and trending following.  
  
If I understand well, You are suggesting that the less steep the angle of the channel, the higher chance of price reaching take profits?

the thing is always look for trend pullback.  
this way one is not in a hurry to trade and have enough time to think.  
fear of missing out can often make us regret later.  
  
the question to ask is pullback to what level?  
nobody knows. will depend on individual's experience.  
but we can look for:  
support/resistance, round number, trend line, fibonacci, etc .....  
so choose a level to wait and see how price is reacting around the chosen level.  
  
in the example,  
if one had chosen the round number in confluence with resistance and fib 61.8 as the level to wait, then it had the best reward with the pin bar as signal.  
if we missed that level, there are other levels to wait at.  
  
what's the clues or footprints left behind by price?  
compare the yellow arrows. the first compared with the rests. the length, the angle ....  
compare the length of green line heights from fractal high to fractal high.  
see the lower high lower low forming.  
not fool proof, but frequently we failed to observe all these tell tale signs (me included).

just in case that someone says that i am deviating from this thread.  
i want to state that these are nitty gritty details i am sharing for additional knowledge's sake that rarely anyone will mention.  
one can trade FCP with or without them.

I drew the channel incorrectly. I should have hit TP1 and moved rest to BE.

Hi brother. Sorry for late answer. It was a matter of the magnitude of the downtrend correction, as you can see, this level limited this correction. For short term scalps, always consider these areas, they can act as S/R. My chart looks a little different, but it doesn't change the essence, I think you will understand.

Not bad for the scalp.  
Looking at this setup, I see that the reaction to the news was known in advance.

Hello! I took only on the first, did not add any more. I just noted the second possibility, if I had not previously entered.  
See how this place looked on m15.

Hey Seysin,  
  
I noticed that your Fibos lately display a TP3 and TP4. I know you said previously that if you get a reaction .236 level that the chances increase that prices goes to the .146 level (past TP2). Can you expand on when you think TP3 and 4 would be hit? Thanks.

TP3, TP4 levels are more often reached on lower timeframes. Usually when scalping.

When you say lower timeframes are you saying m1 & m5?

Actually, I don't think Fibonacci is something quite practical. The support and resistance levels are very intensive, which from the current point of view, is very easy to prove past candles perfectly match Fibonacci theories.

As you might see on other thread, I expect 1,2149. Then we might see a reverse, I think.  
Your plan is good, Sei.

Hey Seysin,  
  
Looks like the trigger candle (one with the circle on top) closes it is already at TP1. When that happens do you usually expect it to get to another level? How do you manage your position in this instance?

Hello!  
Yes, as I wrote earlier, on m1 we get broader targets TP3, TP4, etc.  
I put SL behind the trigger-line on which the candlestick appeared, or behind the local Hi/Lo if it is not far away.  
As you can see, the next deal went against me. And I went out with a loss in two parts. I assumed the possibility of such a scenario,  
since m15 gave the opposite signal, but I was based on larger timeframes, it was not good for scalping. From m1 no need to go further than m30-m15.  
In any case, we continue.

In the chart below, for example, why would someone draw Fibonacci retracement from point A (swing low) to point C and not D? What really determines the other point? I know the next point should be a swing high, but how do you know the right point when a trend has a number of swing highs (B and E included)?

though off topic from FCP, i would not use C. simply because there are other more significant points at high of the month.

Thank you Seysin32 for the project.  
And thank you to all the members.  
I'm training desperately now.  
When I draw FC, I try to think about harmony with the waves.  
The video is very helpful.  
Thank you for meeting me.

ask yourself, what kind of trader are you.  
scalper, day trader, swing trader, investor?  
one cannot be a scalper and act like swing trader intending to take profit 100 of pips away.

Thank you Inthebox.  
I learned a lot from the charts today as well.  
I feel that it is very good to know the FPC and currency strength correctly.  
I am also thinking about what kind of trader I want to be.  
I want to be a well-trained FPC and a disciplined trader.  
Thank you for the good words.

day trading for a slow pair like usdjpy 25 - 30 pips already very good.  
if one can succeed two third of the time, it's considered good.  
aim for consistency.

Hello Seysin32.  
I'm studying around here now.  
While translating the image into English.  
I wish I had studied English when I was younger.  
However, I want to be careful because I notice important things.  
I am really grateful to Mr. Seishin.  
And thank you for the post1776.  
  
Thank you Inthebox for post1777. Thinking, chart analysis, study harder. Thank you.

this is just my style.  
observe point 2. it is important as price both break below, telling possibility of going down.  
you can find out more, google "break of structure".  
point 3 has a lower high in one, and the other a false break up.  
to increase the probability of successful trade, it is best that there is a strong resistance and/or round number above.

With scalping, the spread feels very wide. But the trade was good. Thank you very much.

be careful if you keep on shorting.  
look at the size of green candles compared to the red.

yesterday was one of those days that ranges for audusd.  
the range from london to new york sessions till now was only 35 pips.  
however price has not convincingly stay below the break of structure,  
so i still favour to the upside.

My trade today won, but it's not good.  
I couldn't make the currency I was aiming for, so I ended up with a pair with a thin analysis.  
The trade is over today.  
I feel a little tired.  
The rest of the time will be learned from Mr. Seysin32 and everyone's trade records.

Hi I’ve started to follow this method and trying to trade accordingly but I have few questions  
  
what moving average are you using on H1? I can’t find the post anymore (only the one in first post but referring to m1-5)  
  
At which point you open trade? When it cross live? Or if candle close under (upper) the TL? Or at the retrace to the price exited the channel?  
  
thank you very much

Hello.  
The moving average is just an addition to the general FCP pattern.  
I believe that they cannot be the basis for making decisions (although many use them that way).  
On higher charts, MAs show me the general direction, on lower timeframes - the current situation.  
Now, I use 48 LWMA for H1. Look for signal candles at trigger levels, but before that, you should  
already imagine the general situation with the pair you are trading.  
Answers to 99% of the questions are in the thread.  
Just take your time to learn everything, step by step.  
Even if I didn't know how to read, I would be able to  
understand everything by looking at examples of charts and deals.

Hello.  
Seysin32, I think:  
It's an important idea for me, is that okay?

Also, 3 waves for 1 wave, which can be seen at the 5 minute level, have been achieved.  
It may be different from the FX terminology used in Japan.  
If so, I'm sorry.

Occurrence of 1.  
2\. FCP to know the return position  
Trade a price equal to the wave generated in 3.1  
  
If it doesn't work  
Mistake in trend direction  
I can't understand 1.  
  
Seysin32,  
This is my level of understanding now.  
  
Thank you, everyone.

1\. impulse wave breaking structure.  
2\. place FCP on corrective wave.  
  
this is the main thing i look for.  
for me, as long as it works 66% of the time, i am happy with it.

What you did is similar to the Sperandeo method. maybe it is. but mostly it gives successful results.[http://www.chrisperruna.com/wp-conte..._clhb_wkly.png](http://www.chrisperruna.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/092607_clhb_wkly.png)

As I understand it, the Seysin32 method gives us a previous entry to the Sperandeo method, since according to the graph that it showed we would have to wait for the break of point 3. With FCP we would already be entering the beginning of point 1 or 2.  
  
It may be a good option for the FCP entry continuation. But come on, it's no longer about FCP.

Hello everybody.  
I have read the entire thread and I can only thank Seysin32 for sharing the system and knowledge, as well as in teh box for its multiple examples and application of price action with FCP, which makes the system become our favor with the added value.  
I will try to implement what I have learned, and I will ask any doubts that arise, hoping that they still come to the forum on occasions.  
Thanks

It's important to understand the logic. If you understand the logic, you can interpret it from your point of view. Maybe what looks 9 to you may look like 6 to me. So understand the logic of the system you will learn.

Hello.  
Since then, I have practiced a lot.  
I feel that FCP is even more wonderful than before.  
Thanks to Seishin32 and everyone.

After trying to understand all the points in the system, last night I saw a chart where I could open positions.  
Resistance in D1, downward trend in H1 and I opened in m5, with bearish divergence and respecting the price levels of the channel and fibo.  
Any advice or retification is appreciated.

let's be honest.  
to those who is new to this method would have tried but failed many times, then gave up.  
can you tell me why line 2 works better than line 1?

Viewing only that graph in m15 ...  
Less vertical angle of LT, width of the channel more proportionate to the bearish movement, engulfing candle close to round price, there are no touches to the LT between point 1 and 2.  
It will be interesting to know your opinion, as this is repeated many times before making a price turn.

I see that I entered when breaking LT, but the price did not enter LT2, since when breaking it continues to fall without showing upward force or retracement to 100.0.  
  
Wouldn't it have been better to wait and move the LT to the next min / max that occurred, expecting some rollback to the entry points?

Less vertical angle of LT, width of the channel more proportionate to the bearish movement, engulfing candle close to round price, there are no touches to the LT between point 1 and 2. It will be interesting to know your opinion, as this is repeated many times before making a price turn.

on hindsight, all 3 trend lines are workable on certain conditions, one of which is by placing SL below the round number. price testing the trend lines, not going below them.  
if solely looking only at m15, some would like to have tight SL not mind trying again later on. the larger profit will cover the smaller loss.  
  
what i want to emphasize is to get as many confluence reasons as possible and checking the higher time frames.  
in this example, just by looking at W1 and D1 candles and drawing horizontal lines from their highs lows. Aren't they not support resistance in lower time frames?  
one will see from W1 candle that there was a fake out.  
now will see whether the top is a fake out after a period of testing.  
it's the key level location that is more important rather than trading upon seeing every channel breakout.

But I understand that the SL we do not adjust to the FCP, but we would look for an SL based on the key point or round number, as well as looking for a higher ratio to compensate for losses?  
The greatest possible confluence is what gives us an important advantage in our favor.  
Another query, we use regular divergences as one more point in our favor, but hidden divergences also seem to work very well with FCP, we would always go in favor of trend, I will try to test it.

my preference for SL (not a hard stop) is a strong zone of support resistance (confluence with round number and/or trend line and/or fibo).  
one can also consider the fcp fib 127/161 zone.  
regular divergence is for reversal and hidden divergence is for trend continuation, at times they appear one after another which is better.  
i use macd for divergence, and if it also appear in the histogram, it is better.

But if the SL we take it to the 127-161 zone, then it does not use the TP1 or TP2 in a fixed way?.  
I will try to find some confluences as it says in the box: S / R in htf, follow high timeframe trends, divergences and candle retracements at key points. If with that we get an acceptable percentage and the R / B is positive, in the long term it could be enough.  
As Seysin32 says, keep it simple and calm head

i do not know whether you understand SL at 127-161 zone, so i illustrate with a chart.  
previously i mentioned to watch out W1 top wick at 110.191.

Let's see how the EURUSD starts the week.  
It is not the best situation because it is bullish, but it breaks LT, microstructure, divegence, strong candle at the entry point with rejection, respecting the channel quite well.  
The timeframe could be lowered to look for a hypothetical setback if the break is confirmed. But in demo account and to see it in real ...  
It could have been entered before with FCP (orange line), but at the current point is when I have seen it.  
How do the experts see it?

no clear view at the moment because price is at circled juncture.  
maybe europe session can tell more.  
divergences show both up and down.  
if bias is down, beware of lower support zone.  
if bias is up, wait for trend line breakout and retest.

No suggestions. This system is not intended for backtesting in order to find the Grail, it is intended for trading.  
And what makes it profitable is the subjectivity of an experienced trader.

When you have to fight with the market, and also with the broker ...  
Entry in 100 and 0.75 of the fibo, with operation in favor, but at the beginning of the Asian session ... some broker puts a spread of 20 pips (200 tics).

I'm reading and learning from all the posts.  
My native language is not English.  
I sometimes don't know how to interpret  
I use Google Translate.  
  
Which of the two images do you think is more suitable?  
April 26, GOLD M5  
  
The range of Fibo 100-0 is  
the same width as the width of the channel.  
Am I correct?  
  
If you do not go to the TL,  
How do you make the decision to quit?  
  
please treat me well Thank you.

it was a long time ago.  
my memory may not be accurate.  
  
normally it is just a trend line break method.  
the fib channel is added so that there is some kind of measurement using fibonacci to gauge how far price can travel.  
be it fib 0, 150, 200 ........  
the larger the fib the more difficult to TP.  
  
when drawing the fib channel, see that no price should be touching or below the trend line between the 2 points.  
when price closed below the trend line, note the last fractal high before the drop.  
this is circled in red.  
you can then place place the fib channel mid point line A at the fractal.  
if the distance from the fib mid line to the trend line is too wide, you can use the top fib channel line B to place on the fractal.  
this will make the fibonacci extension smaller.  
so you have a choice of putting the fib mid line or the outer line on fractal high.  
you have to make your own decision to see whether the fib extension 0 or 150 etc is reachable or not.  
range of fib 100-0 is the same as fib channel.  
  
i would advise that when price break the trend line, make sure there is also a break of fractal structure.  
you then can take entry around fib 100 or 79 on retracement.  
after price got to fib 50, you may want to protect the trade to BE.

following daily up trend.  
gold broke up trend line and retraced to trend line with support.  
candle wicks bounced with higher lows.  
tp around fib 50 and resistance.

Hello sir, I would like to ask, are you still using this strategy until now? and does this strategy still work and give good profit? I really hope you can respond to me, thank you.

It reminds me of a fractal strategy. Exiting the channel (or breaking the trend line). Fractal 123 is higher than the significant fractal in the channel. We are building Fibo. The first target is 76.4, the second after breaking 100 is 176.4
