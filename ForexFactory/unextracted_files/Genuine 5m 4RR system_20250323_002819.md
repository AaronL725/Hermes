Welcome to everyone.  
I have toyed with the idea of posting this system for sometime,realising that it comes with a lot of expectations not to mention time consuming. But anyway i”ll take the plunge and hopefully some will get benefit out of it.  
This is one of three systems I trade but is my main system and consumes most of my time.  
The system is based on sound trading principles around the popular triangle chart pattern which most traders are familiar with with a twist , because as good as it is ,by it self will not give sufficiently good results.  
It is an easily learned system ideal for newbies if you know the basics of trading.  
This is a proven system over a long period of time so dont try and change it on this thread otherwise you will just spoil it for every one.  
As I said it is based on ascending and descending triangles but with some very important rules attached to make this one of the most powerful trading strategies you will come across.  
But it does require some patience, if you are looking for a plan that will give you 10 trades a day then best you go elsewhere.  
This system will generate any where between 3 and 8 trades per week based on monitoring 4 pairs only. I trade it on the Yen pairs but will work on any low spread pair.  
I say low spread because we will be using a constant 5pt stop loss.  
A triangle pattern is a continuation pattern in a trending market and what we are aiming at is entering the market at precisely the right time just as it breaks out of the triangle ,using this system it works approx 50% of the time with a Risk/reward of 4 or a Take Profit of 20pts.  
The trick to the success of the system and reducing fake outs is to be very specific of the trades you take, but should not take you to long to learn as I will post as many chart examples as I can of both good and bad examples of trade set-ups so you know what to look for.  
The beauty of this system, unlike others is that you are given some notice of impending trades so subscribers to the thread can inform each other of upcoming trades rather than post trades after they have happened.  
  
I will not be providing a trade posting service to people who are to lazy to put the effort in and learn the system ,once you learn it and it wont take long every one can contribute to posting set-ups patterns they see developing on your favourite pairs so every one can benefit  
This is bare bones trading on naked charts ,you wont find any pretty indicators here, ,the way trading should be.  
  
Shortly I will post the nuts and bolts of the system ,i hope you will come along for the ride. .................... Cont. on post 21.  
  
  
  
Edit: ADITTIONAL QUICK SCALP VERSION  
  
I 've decided to add this method to the standard version, for those traders who are time poor or who just want a little more action while waiting for the prime setups to come along.  
As with most scalp trades it does not have a big r/r rating at just 1to 1 , unlike std. version of 1 to 4 but with practice most should find it quite profitable.  
It does have some restrictions to give it best chance entries just like the standard version and you may want to adjust some aspects to suit your style.  
  
PAIRS;  
We are going to restrict the pairs to just Yen pairs U/Y, E/Y, A/Y, G/Y, as they generally move the fastest.  
  
TRADING TIME;  
Euro and early NY sessions only.  
  
RISK;  
2% risk / stop loss and 2% take profit. So 5pip s/l and 5 pip t/p.  
  
Due to the the types of entries we look for { read standard version to learn first} price is ready to bounce as soon as our order is triggered and usually gets to 5 pips quite quickly. You must however still be patient and get nicely formed setups, sloppy set ups will perform badly. If you are selective you should easy be able to find 2-4 setups per session, more than enough to keep most happy. Do not overtrade!!!!!!!!!  
  
ENTRIES:  
Once you have found a suitable entry , set your Buy Stop at the top point plus your spread {max 1.5} plus .2 pip then . Your t/p is 5 pips above this.  
Example Top of point is 138.32 + .9 spread +.2 = entry price of 139.42.  
For sell we only ad .2 to point value.  
Stop loss is set at same time as Buy/Sell order.  
  
TRADE MANAGEMENT;  
Up to you but once your trade gets to near t/p bring s/l to B/E.  
  
Demo trade this first to get a feel for it and adjust to suit yourself if needed.  
Just as a side note , if your price takes of quickly straight past your 5 pips and you dont have a T/P on, bring your s/l up to 5 pips to lock that profit in see how much extra you can bag.  
  
Just keep in mind that if you choose to use this method it may be hard for you to trade the standard system as you will always be tempted to close trades at 5 pips rather than let them run. Or you could just use it on days when the market is range bound and the standard entries are not to be found.  
  
GOOD TRADING. Any questions just ask.

Ok guys lets get stuck into this.  
I call this THE POINT TO POINT SYSTEM, for obvious reasons as you will see.  
I will start by going over the basic rules that make this system, thats the easy bit.  
The hard bit is learning what for many, who are used to trading with indicators, will have to learn how to trade properly and not just blindly act when a lagging indicator tells you to.  
I"ll cover each section individually.  
  
PAIRS;  
we trade mainly on the yen pairs, but can be traded on any pair that has a small spread.  
both my wife and i trade this system together with 4 computers monitoring 2 pairs each, you can do it on one computer it just means changing screens a lot which i find very annoying.  
The spread is very important because we are using such a tight stop anything more than a 1.5pip spread will cause you to get stopped out too often, fortunately my broker offers [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") anywhere between 0 and 1.5pips on all the majors.  
  
MONEY MANAGMENT;  
Very important not only for your survival but peace of mind, never risk more than 2% on any trade, for example if you had a $1000 account with a 5pip s/l you would only ever be risking $20 per trade, and we are working on a 1 to 4 Risk /Reward ratio so a win will generate $80. We do not reduce the trade risk after a loss we keep it at 2% percent of your original balance as loosing runs dont generally last very long, the longest i have had was 6 from memory and even with that it only takes 2 winning trades to get back in the black .  
Some may think that chasing a 1 to 4 R/R is very ambitious and very often just miss out on getting there and may be tempted to go with a 1 to 2 or 1 to 3 R/R, but if you fall into this trap you will never realize this systems full potential. And i will show you a way later where it is possible to even exceed 1 to 4.  
Cont.

I'LL do is this in mutiple posts as my computer has a bad habit of deleting my typing.  
  
One of the reasons why we can aim and often get the 4 R/R is by being very specific of what and when we trade.  
We only trade when the market is trending with good volume. Do not trade flat market it is just an exercise in frustration with lots of losses  
  
TIME FRAMES  
  
This system will work on any time frame, but we have chosen the 5m because this gives a reasonable amount of entries per week and the 5m is reasonably stable when traded in the right conditons. If you chose to trade it on a larger time frame you will need to alter your trade parameters, for example if traded on 15m your stop will become 15pips and T/P of 60pips and you will probably be waiting a long time to find decent entries.  
  
ENTRIES  
  
getting your entry right is critical to this system and may take some practise,once i start posting some charts it will become clearer.  
When we see a trade set up forming we set a BUY STOP at the highest point plus your spread and your 5pip S/L at the same time and wait for the price to trigger your order ,once it starts moving in your direction you Put your 20 pip T/P on . At this stage do not walk away from your trade ,you need to manage it. I have found it best not to move your S/L to breakeven untill it is 75% to your T/P, you need to give it room to move . Many times you maybe tempted to go to breakeven at 30 or 50 % only to find the market retraces back to your entry and stops you out and then continues straight back up to yourT/P. Having said that sometimes when the market is just not looking good at all i will just pull out or move my S/L up but dont get into the habit of doing this as you will become a very nervous trader.  
With some of these entries ,because we try and time them just as they are about to take off ,sometimes they really take off and dont even give you time to put your T/P on ,in this case if the price goes straight past your 20pips, quickly move your S/L up to the 20 pip mark a lock that profit in ,and sometimes you will get lucky and just go for a lovely profit ride.  
  
NEWS  
  
Usually not a good idea to get into a trade near major news, but if you are and you are in profit tighten up your stop to Breakeven and if the news goes in your favor it will skyrocket you to the finish line.

The aim of the rules in this system is to try and put as many things in your favour as possible and give us the best possible chance of a successful trade, but there are other things to take into account as well ,as this is basically a support and resistence method , we need to look at the chart we are trading in many different ways to get a broad picture of what is going on and not just blindly take a trade because because the entry looks good, things i do is maybe to squash chart up a little to get a better perspective of whats going on and also look at the 15m and 1 h chart to see if there is actually room for this trade to move to your T/P if there is major resistance or maybe a round number just half way into your trade you need to manage that or even worse if there is 0nly 5pips before these obstacles you may reconsider even taking the trade as it might bounce straight back to your S/L very quickly.  
  
I have probably covered the basics ,if i have missed anything obvious please let me know and i will clarify it for you.  
Next step is to show you some charts and put this whole thing together so it makes some sense.  
But before i finish my rambling i need to put this DISCLAIMER in.  
I am not getting any financial reward for posting this system ,it works for me ,it may or may not for you , if it doesnt suit your trading style just move on to the next one but i will not be held responsible for any losses you may encounter using this system. if i or any of the subscribers to this forum are nice enough to advise the other suscribers of an upcoming trade setup and you enter and it fails ,just suck it up ,you take responsibility for your own trades and your own trading decisions, if we all work together as a team we will all benefit and get access to a lot more trades than any of us could individually.  
  
Ok lets see how we go with posting charts this may take some time ,so just talk amonsgt yourselves while i work out how to do it.  
Any questions so Far?

Yes, either upload a screenshot or make a "Print screen" of the chart and edit with some explanations in for example paint or something.  
Then attach and put it in the post! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

I think you need to specify what broker you are using as this M5 will be very broker dependant like you say in terms of spread wise but also spread floating, fixed, news gap spread etc. 5 pips is no wiggle room for anything at all. But very pro on the 1:4 Risk:reward ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1) like it! just need a 70% win rate and will be all good~!!!

70% ???  
  
Rtm if you win 2 out of 10 trades or 20% with 1:4 risk/reward you break even.  
  
Winning 3 out of 10 trades or 30% is a 50% return on investment which is very high.

Get better, can't wait for more information. . .  
I have ten different jpy pairs and obviously some spreads are tighter than others, depending on the pair.  
What surprised me is the fact on how much liquidity there is on some of these pairs.

Ok lets just get realistic here for a minute about expectations for this method, i have been very upfront of what you should be able to expect once you have practiced it, any suggestion that you will get 70% success rate out of a 4/4 R/R system is pie in the sky dreaming, you will get it some weeks but on average no.But then again maybe there are some real smart traders out there RTM ? if so share your wisdom.  
AS for [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") ,yes this system is very sensitive to large spreads and if you decide to use it ,best if you find a broker that fits . I use Vantage Fx on their RAW account, very low spreads, gernerally dosn;t move except in very big news, they will charge a small commission in exchange for the small spread but this can be factored in to your costings .  
  
Charts will come soon .I will show you a range of winning and loosing charts so you see the diffence for your self and then you can go and back test the system .

.Ok Sorry for the delay ,power and internet is sometimes intermitent in my area. I have posted this chart first because it shows clearly what we will be looking for ,it is a continuation pattern of an already established trend ,and you can clearly see the POINT to POINTs marked by the 2 green arrows we are looking for, you need a minimum of 2 to qualify and they need to be inline forming resistance ,although the second or last one can be slightly higher ,but not lower.  
You will notice that the bottom points of this pattern are gradually comming up show that the buyers are slowly growing in strength. when the second point is confirmed ,we should now be on alert of a posible trade setup, but dont get to excited yet, what needs to happen now is another small retracement but smaller than the previous and it must create a nice clean void after the second point. The moment it does this you are free to set your buy and S/L order and wait for the market to move. The lines marked are red for S/L ,yellow for entry and green for T/P. This was taken in a very fast moving market with a clean set-up they dont always look this pretty. The red arrow shows the entry candle, and as you can see it punches straight thru your enrty and 20 min later hits your T/P

.Ok next chart, once again you can see we are in a trend, we can see the 2nd point formed and confirmed and a void created after the second point, this one does not give you alot of notice so you need to be on the ball, this one also went to T/P very quickly .Second point is slightly higher than the first but that is ok[http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&d=1401592171](http://www.forexfactory.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=1438538&stc=1&d=1401592171)

.This is interesting one as it looks like a side ways market, but if you squash your chart up a bit you will see that it is just a fairly long consolidation of a down trend. You will also notice that the last retracement is fairly pinny which is usually not a good sign but in this case you can see each of the candle sticks ends down in a hangman style fashion indicating that the sellers are stronger than the buyers ,then the buyers finnally give up and the price crashes thru your entry and hits your T/P in less than 5min, The charts i have shown you so far are all winners to show you what to look for but you will get loosers aswell The best thing for you to do now is go to your charts and back test and get your eyes trained to pick up these patterns and when you think you have got one post it on the thread and i can critique it for you, ANY QUESTIONS SO FAR?. theTh The [http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&d=1401593293](http://www.forexfactory.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=1438540&stc=1&d=1401593293)

OK Dradon is see the set up you are reffering to ,looks nice doesnt it, but i would not take this trade for a couple of reasons, you will notice the last retracement is slightly higher than the one before ,which breaks the rules ,and that big candle you see there is actually news ,probably red flag news and you should not place trades that close to big news ,hope that helps.  
  
The best and quickest way to learn this system is to back test for yourself and post charts so we can discuss them ,i will be here for most of the day as the weather is crap atm so it is going to be an inside day today.

Thanks for the share. It's funny how you say to squash the chart to see it better. I used to use a bar chart and squash the chart to suddenly see all the patterns. For me, it just made it easier.

Please could you explain the word " pinny " (post 46).  
  
I want to upload a chart, but when I do it with " Upload Screenshot " and look to " Preview ", there is only an attachement and not a picture. What I' m doing wrong?

Hi Traffex, what i mean by "pinny" is the shape of the candle sticks in the last retracement, you will notice that there are large wicks in the make up of the candle rather than a solid body, when you have large wicks on the top and bottom of the body it indicates indicision in the market, buyers fighting the sellers ,this is generally not a good trading enviroment. If you want to learn more about candlesticks or trading in general a good place to start is Baby Pips School OF Pips,just google it.  
  
As for posting charts,someone smarter than me maybe able to help you , i will throw that open ,can anybody help Traffex Please.

If anybody managed to get into this trade you should have you T/P on by now, also there is red Ozzie news comming up shortly,it may not have much effect on this pair but it might be a good idea to bring your stop to B/E just before the news,good luck with it , keep a good look out for other set ups too

I particularly liked this entry as it has the characteristics to look for that will give you the best possible chance of success.  
You will notice that there are 4 points of resistence and the final point is the completion of a long consolidation of an uptrend, squash your 5m chart up a bit and you will see it better. This is not to say that other POINT to POINT set-ups dont work but these i have found are the strongest ones.  
  
Feel free to ask Questions or your thoughts on this method or post charts

Hi rifid,  
  
Any comment on the chart? White arrow is trigger candle. Although gold is high spread but I used to trade it.  
R:R remain = 4R/R  
Update: Broker time 07:16 trigger (1247.25), 09:11 T/P hit (1241.45), S/L (1248.75)

Hi Sam,  
Thanks for posting the chart, it is the quickest way to learn this method.  
What i am looking for in good setups are for at least 2 inline points running in the same line,for example if you had another point inline with your last one that would become a valid setup ,your first 2 points ad to confirmation of a support line but not to an entry. This might sound picky and reduce the number of trade entries but we are looking for high quality setups that have the best chance of succeding, Nice trade anyway hope you were in it.

Thanks for the explanation, now I got clearer picture of high quality setup. I need to be picky cox I only look for 1 or 2 trade per week to achieve my weekly target.  
  
The chart I posted jut got T/P hit. Anyway... demo only![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Does the 2nd bounce (aqua circle) invalidating the setup, or the setup still valid after 3rd bounce (second red arrow)? You said the second bounce cannot be lower than 1st, but maybe higher.  
Do you use pending order or market order to open the position in this method?  
  
Thank you,

> Hi rifid. I'm trying to grasp your method here. I have a few question about this method. Here's USDCAD M5 chart. {image} Does the 2nd bounce (aqua circle) invalidating the setup, or the setup still valid after 3rd bounce (second red arrow)? You said the second bounce cannot be lower than 1st, but maybe higher. Do you use pending order or market order to open the position in this method? Thank you, Pipmunks

Hi Pipmunks,  
This is a good setup,all tops line up nicely, just keep in mind that the CAD is very slow moving at the moment ,you will see on the side bar that there is only 1.5pips between the price bars, i generally like to have a least 3 pips ,5 is even better ,it indicates that the market is in good movement and the chances of getting to your T/P quick are better. Also have a look on the 1hr chart and you will see it is pretty messy and possible resistance at 1.08601.  
In regard to orders ,as soon as you see a valid set up place a pending order and S/L. Hope that helps

Another question if you don't mind. How do you determine the SL size & TP placement? Do you always use 1:4 SL:TP size?  
How do you manage the position after it's opened? Do you use any BE or trailing SL?  
  
Thank you,

Found it. I must be missed it while read from 1st page ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f62b.png?v=15.1). So it's constant 5 SL 20 TP & BE @ 75% near TP.

Please help me on this one...  
  
I looked at his trade and I am a bit unsure. Do you enter when price break 102.35 (the high of this morning), or at 102.14 (the high of Thuesday 27/5 - clearly a resistance level on H1) ?  
  
Do you consider the trade against the question if it provides enouth room (20pips +) up to the next major resistance level at 102.353 before you enter on such a trade?

Hi Tradewins,  
I looked up my records and i took this trade, classic setup, nice consolidation of a down trend showing lots of points of support, then one last small retracement and bang.

Ok i see what you have done,thats not quite what we are looking for ,your us/y and gb/y trades were correct but not your cad or e/y. What you need to look for is a line of resistance or support and the retracements getting smaller as the price gets closer the S/R. We need to keep it tight otherwise we end up just taking anytrade and the whole system falls apart.  
Keep up the good work

Nice thread Rifid, I really like your system, thanks for sharing! But a question/request - Kindly suggest a broker where the [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") are 1.5 pips or below, as yen pairs spread in many broker platforms sometime vary by a big margin.

What you need to look for is a line of resistance or support and the retracements getting smaller as the price gets closer the S/R. We need to keep it tight otherwise we end up just taking anytrade and the whole system falls apart. Keep up the good work

You might think i am nit picking , specially since this trade won for you ,but the last low was actually lower than the one before it which breaks the set up rules, very close though and technically it did change trend aswell so thats ok, also the second top point was lower than the first which is a no no,does this answer your question?

Hello and thank you for sharing. I was reading your thread and have been stalking u/j myself tonight. For this particular trade, do you put in a sell stop a pip below the line when you know the last retracement is lower than the previous in between the points? Or do you do a market order during the breakout?  
My husband and I trade together too. I hope you don't mind me asking, but do you and your wife take shifts? Or do you just trade one or two sessions at the same time watching 2 pairs each?

Hi Sam ,some discretion is involved in trades like this. Because we work on a big 4R/R you can sometimes take these sort of trades if you are an experienced trader ,if not only trade with the longer term trend untill more confident.

Hi Kitara  
My wife and i trade the sessions together and dicuss trade options together,then we can blame each other when when a trade dosnt work Ha Ha.  
I set stop orders as soon as a trade set up is comfirmed ,oh and after you have let everyone else know of your discovery of course. If you try and do market orders you will miss many pips as sometimes price takes of very quickly.

Thanks for the response. Yes, it does it make it easier to blame bad trades when you have a partner ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
Would this be a valid setup on e/j? If a 5 min candle didn't break the last low as shown in the trendline?

I would not take this trade, regardless of how good it looked ,rather than explain why ,can anybody watching please explain to Kitara why this would not be a good trade? If you have read all my posts you would know why this is a higher risk trade.

LOL! Thanks for that. I know why, the higher TF resistance. But thanks for letting me be a teaching moment.  
What about A/J? It has room to move up to meet the last high. Do you like the breakout range to be a bit wider though?

Go to the top of the class Kitara, allways look at the big picture before you trade.  
The A/y set up even though it is small would be valid in the right context, be aware of news comming up soon though

thanks for sharing Rifid, actually from the supply demand perspective, each time price comes back to a level, the more order is filled and the bounce getting smaller each time before finally breaks the level  
I like it, it's like the other alternative to trade supply demand for me  
please forgive me if its out of topic, just want to share my comment  
will be following this thread 

In the end its just a stupid numbers game

Good comment Danzka,shows you have grasp the idea of this method ,not hard is it.  
The reason why this system works {most of the time} is it just follows basic trading principles and price action, you just need to find these set ups in the correct position on the chart ,once you have trained you eyes to detect them as they are forming it will become much easier ,rather than see it after the fact, it takes some practice ,but it is worth it.  
Thanks for the comment

Thats right even at 50% success rate with 4R/R your laughing all the way to the bank.  
Take this example  
If you have a $100,000 account  
You risk 2% on trade  
If it wins thats $ 8000 based on 4r/r  
At average 50% win rate say thats av. $4000 per trade.  
Thats av 4% return per trade ,Most banks wont even give you that in a year in interest

Yeah I agree with you, as for Sonic I only use the volume, got it from a friend, for me its to know how busy market is

Hi Pipmunks ,this trade voided itself when it broke the previous low, is that what you are refering too?

I'm referring to the short setup. Does the 2 bar retracement before the break too small to make the setup qualified?

pipmunks, nice setup but I dont see triangle in your chart but square ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) This is what rifid reply to me "What you need to look for is a line of resistance or support and the retracements getting smaller as the price gets closer the S/R.".

You go it Mario. the clearer and cleaner the set up the better they work.  
You do have to be patient with this method and put in the chart time ,but at the end of every week you will be glad you did.  
It does not take many 4 rr trades to make a living

BTW, rifid - I applied your system on the USD/JPY 1H... Long orders were hit @ 102.480 & 102.495... SL @ 102.340, and TP @ 102.800... Just playing around with it...

Rifid,  
  
In your experience trading this method, what is your estimation about the win rate? does it reach 55% winning trade?

Hello rifid and all,  
I took the A/U break down. Seeing if it'll go back to the low of .9235 area. rifid, you put in some long hours!! Do you trade up until NY lunch, or is this a longer day than usual for you? I've been trading now for a little under 10 years. I find the longer I do this, the lazier I become. Meaning the less screen time I want to do ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) So now I do a one entry system on A/U every day except the high news days. Which means less than 10 trades a month now. My husband does a swing system using a 4 hour geppy chart. However, I like your system and we have vacation coming up soon. I'm going to see if this will buy us a few extra cocktails at the beach.

If your patient and are prepared to wait for good set ups you will get 50% easily.  
with trading its a numbers game ,the more good setups you find the more trades/wins you get. But one person can scan only so many pairs at once , thats why if we work together and advise each other of pending setups it takes a lot of load of the individual.Many pending setups dont actually form into trades but its good to notified of them so they can be monitored. Make sense?

I'm in the a/u at the moment aswell, i love the challenge of trading { not to mention the money} but it can get boring sometimes, i am finding this thread very interesting, talking to different people, getting opinions and somtimes a different slant on things ,i've been trading for 8yrs but always open to new ideas.

Might not get my cocktail money on this one. Looks like AU is now trying to form a triangle to breakout to the upside. This pair might be running out of steam because of the time of day. Do you see what I'm seeing? Would you close the trade, stop and reverse, or keep the original trade and play to still target the longer TF S/R?

Well, short term trend is down, so I'll let it just hang out for now. Beautiful day here, so I'm off to go get some sun. Just double checking to make sure there is no FOMC news coming up that will whip me out with [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide"). Don't need to make that mistake too many times before you learn, lol. But looks like it's going to be a quiet US afternoon.  
Have a great day everyone!

If it wasnt for the RN, I would say this simply looks like profit taking, end of the session.

Spyderman, it looks fine, BUT I see a major resistance at 139.864 of the HTF. Secondly, I see the Low-to-High for the day is already 683, where the Daily Average is only 674. This makes me wonder if there is enough steam in this engine for another shift to the high?   
  
I might be wrong, but it is my 2c.

Good Morning everyone,  
I thought i would post this chart this morning of an NZ/US trade last night, which we didnt get because no one was looking at this pair. But it is a classic example of what to look for when searching for set ups with this method.  
You will notice you have 2 points in line{need a min. of 2} forming resistance at the bottom.  
At the top we have lower lows, indicating increased seller pressure.  
As soon as we have a second point form and a void form after it we set our sell stop and stop loss and wait for price to come down and trigger entry.  
If at any time after the second point price moves up above the previous high, this voids the set up and take your pending order off.  
The exact opposite applies for long trades.  
Oh most important point ,once second point and void is confirmed advise others in the group, we will thank you.  
This trade went to T/P in around 3minutes ,great way to get 4 R/R . You only need one of these a week to get rich.

Good Morning/Evening Rifid,  
This one may have been disregarded because of the previous support in the 1hr time frame that you would have saw while doing analysis. Notice how interestingly it's now resistance after that breakout occurred. Anyway, wasn't this the milk curdle news, lol.  
No aussie trading for me tonight since it was GDP news. So I'm hanging out looking at yen pairs to see if I can find a potential setup that might be starting. I got nothing yet. You did mention in an earlier post that you get 3-8 trades a week on the 4 pairs you watch. Is that per pair, or between all 4 of them?

Well, maybe a u/j setting up? Last SR not far enough away to target 20 pips, but might be worth attempting target 1 at the round number or last resistance at 102.48.

Maybe a E/J looking better. Sorry, now I'm taking over your thread with my charts. These are addictive and fun to find. Let me know if these are ones that would meet your criteria.

This is more what we are looking for Kitara,a continuation of a trend, we are not trying to catch retracements , they are a little to high risk for me.  
The 3 to 8 trades per week are for the 4 pairs onlythat we scan, would get a lot more but it is to hard to successfully look at any more than 4 pairs at a time.  
You actually come across dozens of Point to Point setups every week, the trick is to discard the crap and be patient and wait for the quality setups ,it takes time ,but after a while it becomes second nature to spot them, train your eyes and train your brain. after a few weeks you will be amazed at how easy it is.

Entry for this if you liked it would have been 102.633 , i would have ignored the wick on candle 08.15 and just went with the bodies of the candles.its reversing anyway

Hi rifid  
  
I didn't see the void, so gave this UJ short a miss.

Good move! I saw the same but didn't know what to do - lost 4.6pips on slippage. Which isn't too bad I think.

Slow down man ,wait for the good setups, that one on the GP is what your looking for ......a consolidation of a longer trend, look for your Point to point then set orders and wait, Easy

Not quite Pips, the gp/us just before and the U/J earlier today {post 191 and 190} are text book setups. They are not as common but they nearly always work,Patience my good man? try not to be trigger happy,

Sorry Austin didnt see your post there, up to you but i would be a little more patient on this trade, it is not a neat setup and you will encounter resistence all the way down.On the hour it is still in a strong uptrend

Agreed... I am still holding longs on USD/JPY for the moment... Think we'll see more definite movement around 2:00pm... Or rather - when US opens...

Thanx for replying.. So to make a valid setup, the trade has to be with the trend and not a retracement??

The last high was lower by 0.5p at my broker feed. Is that OK? As I remember the rule is the 2nd point may be higher (not lower) for buying setup.

Hello, all.  
This is my first post in this forum and I am interested in this trading method. This is what I draw on EURAUD. Didn't trade it because the resistance is on the way to 20pips.  
Is it the right 1?  
  
Now it's triggered but I didn't take it.

You are allowed a little leeway if it is a REALLY good setup, you dont want to let 8% slip by because of a bit of a pip do you![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

If resistence is 5pips away from your entry,i wouldnt take the trade, if it is 10 or more you can take the trade but manage your stop if it looks like it cant break thru

Mario - I am holding longs from yesterday on a 1H setup... You are right, there is no setup on the 5min graph at the moment...

Apologies if this is wrong, but can I just confirm the image below is roughly what we are looking for?  
  
Almost a contraction of price before it breaks the previous s/r level?

You could almost build a case for an entry here if you ignore the wicks and use the bodies as a point, easy to say in hindsight though

And I'm home... Another 5 hours of trading, but with peace and quiet...  
  
Kind of decent setup on U/J a while ago, but waaaay too late for an entry...   
  
Might be something forming on EUG/GBP, but it's a bit messy...   
  
I got nothing else for now... Just happily holding the longs I have...

1H & 4H trend is solid bullish at the moment... I've been holding longs for a while now on it, so just adding as we're going along...

Red aussie news comming up soon.Just incase anybody is in a trade, although you shouldnt be,as this system has generated no trades in the last few hours.  
One thing i must stress with this system, it is definitly not for the trigger happy types, it takes time and patience to wait for the good quality setups, if you can do that you will be rewarded, if you cant and just jump in on any point to point set up you will be dissapointed with the long term results and just get disallusioned with the system and blame it for your failings. If you get bored waiting for quality setups go and play on a demo account and relieve your frustrations.  
I used to want to open my charts up every morning and just want to trade anything i see , get a quick thrill out of being "in a trade" but in the end it ususally ends in tears.  
Remember the story of the Hare and the Tortoise? slow and steady wins the race.  
Who would you rather be at the end of the week , The trader who has had 30 trades and won 3%or lost.............. or the trader who waited and only taken 4 trades and got 16%.?  
All the examples i have shown on my posted charts are good quality setups ,if the setup you are considering dont look like those ,play trade it if you cant restrain yourself and just keep it to yourself.  
  
Any way thats my words of wisdom for the day  
Any questions ,i will gladly answer them for you, and welcome any new subscibers

I was just reading the thread and thought I would show this current set up on EUR/USD **__1 hour chart__**. Just needs a dovish ECB today and a positive NFP tomorrow and you will have your 4x risk by early next week. I dont trade this way normally but I will have a crack at this one and let you know how it goes. I have placed a sell stop order at 1.3580 with a 40 pip stop and 160 pip tp risking 1%

It will never stop to amaze me how people look at the same chart, and read different signs... I really love the markets, and the way you can never stop learning...   
  
Anyways - so our time zones are actually quite different, then... You put in a lot of hours...

I know what you mean, when you flick from one pair to another continously it is very easy to overlook the big picture and miss that Perfect setup, in an ideal world you would have everyone just concentrate on one pair only ,but advising the others when a quality setup comes along,that way no one misses out and it is a lot more relaxed way of trading.Any thoughts on that?

Hi Rifid  
  
Thanks for this creating the thread and sharing your experience.  
  
_Since you seem to keep a journal and records of your past transactions (very smart practice btw), would you be kind enough to share some specific information of your statistics...or at the least the number of B/E occurrences. Not personal income figures obviously...but rather win/loss versus the break-even and number of transactions where you actively manage the trade and take profits before the 20TP initially established._  
  
  
From what I gather in this thread, this would be the average results on a weekly basis :  
  
I don't know however what are the B/E occurrences. I don't know either the number of occurrences where you manually intervene in the trade with a trailing stop loss or manual closing of the trade. My worry is that a 20 pip T/P on a M5 time frame is very high and cannot be reached that often (without retrace to the SL), especially in a market where we see lower ranges (volatility) and a lot of sideways price action. I am not lazy and will do my DD and back testing, but would appreciate your input on this if possible and if you find the time.  
  
  
Capital : $10,000  
Risk (in %) : 2%  
Risk (in $) : $200   
Take Profit (in %) : 8%  
Take Profit (in $) : $800   
  
Winning ratio : 50%  
Loosing ratio : 50%  
Trade occurrence : 3 to 8 per week  
3 Trades : Loss : ($300) Gain : $1,200 Net : $900 (see Note 1)  
8 Trades : Loss : ($800) Gain : $3,200 Net : $2,400 (see Note 1)  
  
Note 1: Without considering spread and commissions  
  
Break-even under the above hypothesis would be as follows :  
Winning ratio : 20% (see Note 1 above)  
Loosing ratio : 80% (see Note 1 above)  
  
Kind regards

> {quote} Hi Rifid Thanks for this creating the thread and sharing your experience. Since you seem to keep a journal and records of your past transactions (very smart practice btw), would you be kind enough to share some specific information of your statistics...or at the least the number of B/E occurrences. Not personal income figures obviously...but rather win/loss versus the break-even and number of transactions where you actively manage the trade and take profits before the 20TP initially established. From what I gather in this thread, this would...

Hi Spar,  
i have given your question some consideration since you took some time to compose it,  
I am a little reluctant to give my results as others individual results may vary some what as it is not purly a mechanical system ,such as an indicator based system which just tells you when to put a trade on, this is quite discretionary, and the more experienced you get at it the better your results become.  
This system is more suited to the serious trader who has realized that most indicatoer based charts dont work in the long run,and that price action is the only thing that counts, unfortunatly it takes time to learn how to read charts properly and follow the flow of them. For example from starting this thread i have realized even though i put up good examples of quality setups ,peoples interpretation of them seem to be much different to mine, so you are going to get varied results from person to person, its easy for me because i have been doing it for a long time ,i know what shaped patterns have say an 80% chance of success and which ones may only have a 20% success rate.  
What i like about this system is the 4/rr which is great for your mental positon as a trader, as most traders know once you have 3,4,5,or more looses in a row on a 1 to 1 r/r system it is very hard mentally to stick to your system and keep putting trades on, with 4r/r you can make numerous mistakes and still make a profit .  
This is only the first week this system has been published it will take time for traders to learn it properly , but once you have mastered it you'll never need another indicator again and you will start see things in your charts that you have never seen before , it will be like someone has just turned the light on inside your head.  
But just for your curiosity i have gone through my records for last 6mths.  
  
Wins 75  
losses 77  
B/E 28  
The low number of B/e is surprisingly low ,mainly because once price gets to 75% of T/P it usually goes on fairly easily.  
Some trades i do manage if a trade looks like it is not performing the way i like i will take appropriate action on it  
These figures of mine are only based on 4 yen pairs that i watch  
Hope this goes some way to answering your questions.

If you squash a 1h chart up you will get a better perspective on this ,you will notice it is the bottom of a consolidation channel, it should eventually continue down ,but may want to make another run up to the top of the channel before hand .

Hi Rifid  
  
Thanks for taking the time to respond. I concur with your view and understand.  
  
One last question on this issue if I may ...and if not perceived as intrusive? Of the +/- 75 wins, what % have attained 20pips TP ?  
  
The reason I asked is simply to try to determine how much of your straightforward strategy follows the basic rules of 20TP / 5SL _versus_ your _discretionary_ intervention. If say 50% of your wins are between 1 and 19 pips, then a lot of experience is required to handle this strategy and know when to close the position. If most of them close with TP, then we can concentrate on correct entries (set-ups) rather than analyze all the other variables on back and live tests.  
  
I must say however that either way, this is a great thread for traders to appreciate reading the naked charts and price action rather than clustered lagging indicators. Probably one of the best threads in its simplicity and no-false illusions.  
  
Thanks again for the time and effort you put in this thread.

Around 90% of the profitable trades go to 18 to 20 pips , often if price gets to within a few pips of T/P and stalls i will close the trade to save it comming back to B.E

I trade the Asian and Euro sessions, but most of the trades would come from the Euro session as it is generally smoother and faster moving market.  
I find the best results are when the price diff in the side bar is 5 pips or greater

Red flag news in 20m , be careful about entering any trades, if you are in a profitable trade you may want to consider bringing stop to break even

No to both Gareth, 1st one you are trading against the trend ,second one is closer, but the second point is higher than the first ,needs to be level or can be slightly lower.  
Have a look at my posted charts,they show what to look for

Personally, I wouldn't trade any CHF pair, unless you're scalping... Way too much volatility today...

AUDUSD is a bit high risk for me. The resistance is just above.  
I will put buy stop on the highest high if I want to trade this.

Hi Rifid and all,  
I just wanted to say thanks again. I deleted my Eur/Jpy post from last night because it wasn't in the setup that rifid explained. Although.. I did win, it was against the exact rules, so I removed it to remove confusion and to not disrespect Rifid's overall teachings.  
I see a lot of potential in this method, so I still want to play along. I promise to only post charts that I think meet the perfect criteria so I don't get sent to the back of the class again ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
Besides, this has more action then my aussie system but as Rifid rightly called me out on, it still takes patience to wait for just the right ones.  
So happy trading everyone!!

I live in the upper part of the states where we get only a couple months of warm weather. Today was a nice one though! Sunny and warm. I envy your location. Even before you retired. I was in Australia last year in Sydney and it was like living in paradise.   
As for setups, I'm not seeing any tonight. Anything on your radar?

Just out of interest, while i am patiently waiting on a new set up i was scrolling back on the 4h charts ,and i come across quite often the Point to point consolidation set ups and are amazed how reliable they are. So any one who is into longer term trading or even a self managed retirement fund or Super Fund as we call them in Oz may want to incorporate these setups into your trading strategy.

Hi Rifid,  
Thank you for this thread.  
I also trade in a familiar way.  
Your attention to detail and patience if fantastic.  
Your rules for entering a trade have opened my eyes to the charts and price movement that I had not noticed before, but what I have been looking for.   
I was looking for a filtering tool to try eliminate some of the bad trades, but I didn't want to use indicators, as I normally trade the first couple hours of London lagging indicators can be completely out of rhythm with what is about to happen.  
I'm also a big fan of 5 Minute charts and I like your R:R.  
Do you watch the charts all Asian and Euro markets or at certain times?  
Also can you tell what sort monthly return you get as a %.

I see that and it might just be voiding itself as we speak if it goes much higher

Hi Spiritwalker  
  
**Your opinion would be appreciated** with regards to your last chart. I thought we are suppose to trade with the trend after some consolidation, triangle formation and specific rules as per RIFID's examples and indications.   
  
When I look at the hidden left side of your chart, it seems to me that we are in a uptrend on the NZDUSD and NZDJPY. The set-up seems more like a counter trend. (I included snapshot herein)  
  
Thanks for your input.

Hi Spar  
  
Included is a 4H chart... Trend is down - I ignore 5min "trends" as they usually don't represent the actual trend, and it's easy to lose sight of where the price action is heading...  
  
**So here is my opinion :** On the NZD pairs I would much rather take shorts at the moment than longs, since PA has been heading south for quite some time. What I see on 5min is a actually a smallish retrace, and an excellent opportunity to add to existing shorts on longer term trades (if you had any.) The very first rule I learned when I started trading, and trust me, I learned it the hard way : "The trend is your friend."  
**Again - this is just my opinion, and should not be taken as advice or trade indicator.**

Just be aware some of these pairs are trying to line us up for shorts, but i reckon there long term plan is to continue north, any thoughts?

**Thanks for sharing your experience and opinion Spiritwalker**. True that H4 and Daily are downtrend... but I usually only look at 1 or 2 time-frames higher with a scalping strategy.  
  
"The trend is your friend." ..... I am learning the hard way as well ... as I have better friends out there. LOL

On most I am long biased... Have longs on USD/CAD & USD/JPY, and shorts on USD/CHF... Keep in mind that these trades have been taken on 1H & 4H charts, and according to another system, not this one. I have had these positions since mid May and onwards. Personally I would not take any more trades today, as I expect another choppy ride like yesterday - if not worse.

I would ad to that, that i do not generally go out to a 4h chart as it has little bearing on what 5m chart is doing. but by all means look at all aspects of the situation ,but dont try to over analys it or you will just find ways of talking yourself out of taking trades, If the set up looks GOOD in a fast moving market,just take the trade,

Good morning,  
  
you're feeling is correct. We had big ranges yesterday - i guess, until NY opens we will see a very very flat market. Even too tight for a 20 pip target....

Yep saw that, for good quality setups we need the tops to line up and as few pinny candlesticks as possible, remember neat and clean and pure in form gets the best results

Congratulation Coastie .... Nice ... and good discipline on your part not to have pulled the plug before it hit the TP.   
  
Question for RIFID if you find the time : It seems that EURJPY was a nice set-up that follows the rules. Does the fact that there is **no or little void** after the last point (no retrace) be something we should look at ... or is this only one of the elements that would make it just perfect set-up for a trigger ?  
  
Thanks

Small void big void dos'nt matter as long as the whole set up looks 'Right" .It may take some time for you to know what looks right but it will come.

Rifid, looking good...is there anyway you can display your charts for this week on these trades in one place here or in pdf?  
  
I have been studying your thread and I know some of the charts are in the forum, but not all of them...it would be great to see them all in one place and very beneficial...

Right on, mate... I agree totally with you... I think you will agree, but I will keep posting charts here and there, but also not every other trade I take... Thing about trading is this : You have to find a system and a feel for the market that suits you. That, unfortunately, means you can not just copy somebody else's trading methods, and think you will be successful. I have tried that for a very long time, before I learned that lesson...

Isn't the second point higher than the first? Doesn't that invalidate the trade?

Just saying what I'm seeing... Use it, don't use it... And referring back to this morning's conversation - trend on higher time frames is down, so I'll be more inclined to short that go long on this pair... But like I said, it's an opinion, and I'll trade it when I feel it has developed to a point where the risk might be viable...

Thank you Spiritwalker for displaying a chart and calculating your risk...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
To me D chart is in uptrend but at the lower high, however 4H trend turned lower...  
  
I think perhaps Rifid will discuss what time frame is a viable time frame to look at for market direction or allow us to place some sort of MA on 5 min chart so we can all be in agreement Trend is up or down

GUH1 appears in an uptrend, Spiritwalker, can you clarify how you see a downtrend and on which timeframe ?

This is on is cleaner... And for this reason, I would much rather short the GBP/USD than take a long on 5min...

Actually does look quite nice for a buy, yeah... I'll keep an eye on it... Would put the top horizontal line a bit higher, though... Right on the tops... (Ignoring that huge spike on news, of course...

EJ has to clear 139.932 for a much bigger upside move. Watching it closely.

Just one question....  
  
It is late Friday, the Asian + Europe markets are closed and the bankers all packed up for the weekend after one long and spiky week with the G7 meetings, ECB and NFE.  
  
Do you believe the markets still have enough steam in the engine for a 20 pip move?  
  
I hope I am wrong!

Honestly, I don't know... I reckon if there's any movement left in the markets, we'll see it in the last half hour or so of trade in US... I have long ago stopped to try and figure out where the market will be going... EUR/JPY had a nice setup... AUD/JPY had a nice setup... And one or two more... But I didn't take any...

You make a good point, flat markets are very frustrating.  
  
All we can do is place the trade as per rules and wait and see if it has any legs.

All the above charts are screen shots of most of the trades taken from this weeks set ups from post 411  
The green horizontal line indicates, and lines up the points, the yellow vertical line indicates a winning trade and the red lines are the loosing trades.  
You should easy be able to locate these setups on your chart.  
When the 5 m chart is compressed as these are it is easy to see the setups in relation to the prevailing trend.  
You will also notice that the setups with the best chance of success are in the direction of the trend. that is not to say counter trend trades wont win ,but success rates are lower.  
If you zoom into these trades you will notice how the general makeup of them are neat and cleanly formed, untidy setups reduce your chances of winning.  
Each one of these winning trades will put 8% into your account, such is the power of a 4 risk /reward system.  
Even very average traders who could only pick 3 out of every 10 winners will still make a profit trading this system.  
Any thoughts and questions welcome.

Thanks for start ths thread. I am a swing trader looking for more opportunities. This week on the 4RR system I was 1 W 0L 2 BE. I will take that every week!  
  
Question on this last chart, Was this trade actually a loss? You have a yellow vertical line but it did not go up 20 pips. Am I wrong?  
  
Thanks!

Great stuff rifid. Great strategy and explanation. I mostly have traded flat top/ bottom triangles on longer time frames but your strategy & eplanation has added a whole new dimension to my trading approach. Thanks again for sharing your ideas.

Hi rifid  
  
Thanks for sharing your trade records of last week.  
  
As homework, I went over every trade on my charts to see and learn what you did. Need to clarify a few points as some results don't quite seem to tally...  
  
2 June, u/j 15.20 Loss 2% (long trade) -- I see price went to at least 75% of target before turning, so stop loss would have been moved to BE. You reported a 2% loss here.  
  
2 June, G/j 21.05 Loss 2% (long trade) -- same as u/j above, I see BE instead of -2%.  
  
3 June, g/j 7.35 B/E 0 (short trade) -- price didn't reach 75% of target, perhaps only about 50%. How was this trade exited at BE? Was there a special consideration, e.g. news release?  
  
3 June, a/u 16.40 B/E 0 (short trade) -- price barely moved for Aussie after entry; again how was the trade exited at BE? Was there a manual exit which avoided a loss?  
  
4 June, us/chf 3.45 Win 8% (long trade) -- I see price went up about 10 pips before heading south. If trade was exited at the top, it would have been 4% (or +2R). How did you do 8%?  
  
General question: on some trades, it appears that stop loss was hit if we factor in the spread. So, does the 5-pip stop loss include or exclude the spread?  
  
Rifid, your clarifications will certainly go a long way in helping me (and members who have looked at the said trades on their charts) learn the fine points of your 4R/1R method. Thanks again for sharing, cheers ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Well according to RIFID, this trade has been invalidated.  
  
"You will notice that the bottom points of this pattern are gradually coming up show that the buyers are slowly growing in strength. when the second point is confirmed ,we should now be on alert of a possible trade setup, but don't get to excited yet, what needs to happen now is another small retracement but smaller than the previous and it must create a nice clean void after the second point. "  
  
The retracement after the second point to larger that the first retracement.

I see...rifid and spiritwalker, would you still take this trade if it breaks green line? or you would totally dismiss it...because of that condition..

I know you didn't ask me.. but I agree with avgjoe. its not clean enough and its making lower lows.  
I hope this helps.  
also remember bank holiday today in Australia and Europe so there may not be much movement.  
cheers

> Hi rifid Thanks for sharing your trade records of last week. As homework, I went over every trade on my charts to see and learn what you did. Need to clarify a few points as some results don't quite seem to tally... 2 June, u/j 15.20 Loss 2% (long trade) -- I see price went to at least 75% of target before turning, so stop loss would have been moved to BE. You reported a 2% loss here. 2 June, G/j 21.05 Loss 2% (long trade) -- same as u/j above, I see BE instead of -2%. 3 June, g/j 7.35 B/E 0 (short trade) -- price didn't reach 75% of target, perhaps...

> Ignored

i will Just quickly go thru Pipsikoala questions,  
2/6 u/j referring to the posted chart you will see 2 entrys first a looser as it hit s/l just after entry ,and then a re- entry as this was still a good set-up and this won ,although i did not count this win in the results.  
2/6 g/j again hit s/l just after entry.  
Most of the others if they were excited early you will probably notice a discernable change in trend sometime after entry, if this happens,and i dont mean just a retracement , you would be crazy to stand by and watch your profitable trade go into loss .  
The 5 pip s/l does includes your spread so you need to restrict yourself to pairs with max of 1.5 spread or find a different broker.  
Hope this helps

Question on this one, the second retracement is bigger than the first. Does that matter? Thanks,

Your right it is not the neatest set up but the last retracement is lower than the one before. A discretionary trade that looks like it will pay off.  
Just remember once you get profficient with this system you will just get a feeling for good and bad trades, and with a 4/r/r you are allowed a few mistakes

NZDUSD formed a bearish pinbar on daily last friday and seems bearish on longer term time frames. Is at a strong resistance currently, so may turn back down. BE careful there.

for my trading I have added another rule which is I will close the opened trade if price doesn't move in 1 hour  
for me breakout should be fast

Yeah.could not use the suggested SL because of the spread. I quite understand that this system works best with low spread currency pairs.but just trying it out to see if SL can be adjusted to accommodate slightly higher [Spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide"). the only issue would be targeting a much smaller TP.  
Please explain why this setup isn't ok. 'Cos to me, it obeys the rules (apart from the SL)

I think I see what you mean Rifid,  
wait for price to come up to the first spike on the left  
and draw the line there @ 102.500 ?

Thats right ,let the price come to where you want it, patience is the key.  
Remember you only need one of these wins a day to get rich, actually you only need 1 per week, and if you where lucky you would have got two already today

Hi there,  
I have been trading similar to this for a while and doing pretty well.  
Late last week I found this thread and studied rifids rules and it seems he has got it spot on. I really like the R:R. and the attention to detail in his rules for entry.  
So I changed my rules slightly to match his and so far 3 entries in 2 days all winners. 2 of these I did exit early at 18 pips instead of 20 due to previous support levels, which turned out, if I had let it run they both would have reached 20 pips. oh well...  
Also due to other commitments I have missed out on 2 other trades today. 1st was N/U this morning which didn't meet rifids rules (before Asian market) winner. and second E/J which was a loser.  
Considering today there were bank holidays everywhere it was a good day.  
My suggestion would be to practice on demo till you are comfortable, keep looking at the charts that rifid has posted and keep your charts clean of any indicators.  
Cheers

Rifid, going back to the U/J would you begin to look for a sell set-up developing now, since the trend is  
beginning to look bearish on the short time-frame, or would you still wait for the bullish set-up, since  
the trend is bullish on the longer time-frame?

Good morning traders,  
After a good day yesterday it went all quiet in the late US session. the euro pairs flattened out and had a good rest, was quite suprised to see the us/chf trade that i left open before retiring last night had only moved 5 pips in 8hrs, but at least i am still in it with a chance.  
Did anyone see this continuation on the e/g ,had a nice line of points ,one last small retace and down., lets see how that plays out.  
Any way good luck for today.

This entry was a bit late, set your sell stop at about .2 of a point below break out line, otherwise you have to far to get to t/p. Dont chase price

Hi danzka  
  
Just looking at your screen layout.  
  
Assuming the grey areas are market time zones?  
  
Your volume indicator looks like it might be Sonic? Do you find it of any use? I have looked at a few charts of various people with it attached and can't see any correlation to market activity....I guess it depends on how you use it? 'traderathome' does seem to have added some arrow indicators on his charts that look like they may be useful warnings - not sure if they're connected though.  
  
Cheers  
Seth

Grey areas is supply demand  
  
yes the volume indicator is sonic, I use it for VSA, I found volume useful,  
I don't know any other 'traderathome' indicator  
  
hope it helps Seth

Good morning all,  
  
Rifid, as an example on G/U am I to understand that price has to move to either yellow line before looking for a set-up  
and forget everything in between?

No certainly not, if you find a GOOD quality set up , and it has some clean" air" to move in ,take the trade. Squash your 5m chart, and have a look at the 1h just to get a feel for the market as a whole . Remember their is no obligation to take every setup you see, There are a lot around this week so far, so you can afford to cherry pick them.

I see the possibility it might stop at 102.10, so only 2R/1R. Hmmm...

would this U/J qualify as a set-up? Thanks for your time...

Good morning Guys, Have a look at a potential trade setup on GU (15 mins chart though).Waiting for PA to hit the Support line and break through before taking a trade. As taught here, using SL of 15 pips and looking for a RR of 4:1, guess i would be targeting 60 pips profit. pix coming up

Tech nically it does, but i would restrain myself from taking it, becaused of the overall shape to it ,i think it is too steep in its retracements and looking on the 1h ,i would be concerned that it would continue to 20pips with out a deep retrace, but i may be wrong of course

The setup is not 100% completed. Just waiting for the 3rd bounce on the support line. I had to reduce the screen so as to capture the important part: PA on the Support line and the Trend line

Hi Contrax ,this system will not work on those spreads you will need to find a different broker, there are plently of them that offer suitable spreads.

Good morning,  
  
you're spread will be connected with the account-type you have. Small account's (below 10k capital) will have bigger spreads. Only the "pro" accounts will have spreads below 1 pip - or no spread (ecn-account) and a fixed commision for each lot traded.  
  
hope this helps...  
  
best regards

Oh thank you to all, well but i think is that the size of the capital... So if i want to invest 1k usd, i cant use this system cuz the spread cost? Or maybe if the SL is 5pips with 1.5 spread. Can i use SL 8pips and TP:20? o_O (w/e im using demos account)

Type " Brokers" in search button on top of this page - there are many threads discussing any broker related question you may have. Many other readers had the same problems. Good luck!

My spread is most of the time between 1 and 2 pips, i'm using a sl of 7 pips and a tp of 21 pips. This is an inital Risk/Reward of 1:3. It isn't that good like rifid has, but still an atractive reward for scalp-trading. I'm looking to lower my sl -5 pips as soon as possible, so putting the odds by this into my direction. By the way, i'm doing this with all my entries

Up to you ,but if you change the S/L your results will change. Keep shopping around plenty of good brokers with low spreads.

My first trade trying to follow your advice thanks Rifid. I closed it at 18 pips but maybe I should have left it longer.

Hi Rifid,  
  
Thanks for posting the concept and the continued feedback along the way. I tried my first demo test of the concept last night. It didn't work out but a fresh look at it this morning made it clear why it was flawed from the start so at least I learned something from it.  
  
One question I haven't seen in the thread so far though is when you see setups on multiple correlated pairs (i.e. E/J and G/J, etc.) do you typically take the better looking one, take both or split your risk (i.e. take 1% on each rather than your usual 2%)?

Interesting question, and it really depends on your tolerance to risk, i once took 3 trades within 15m as they where all perfect setups and all won with-in 45m , but that dos"nt happen often. So in answer to your question if you see mutiple good setups dont get greedy just take the best looking one and be happy to get your 8%, until you get more experience with the system

Rifid,  
  
Thank you for your method, I don't call it a system because it is screen time what makes it work. I have observed this PA over years but never put it into something. I have been trading H1 for some time but I might steer to M5 and it's great to hear that you were trading it for long time with success. I hope to contribute to this thread as well as others.  
  
Kind regards,  
Airidas  
  
P.S AUDJPY might drop something..watching

Based on what I understood, I've drawn the entry line on the second (and third, nearly) point; the first point was a bit higher, which is perfectly ok for a short trade based on rifid rules. Do correct me if I'm wrong. Thanks.

For short it can be slightly lower, not higher.

Learning here as well....I don't see where your second point hits as well. Your first point hits the line just before 18:25. Where is your second point?

The first point is just before the 16:25 mark, above the line.  
  
Should have labeled the points on the chart ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1)

Here is a different one...Comments welcome.  
  
Looks at the AUDJPY long on the 4 hour. Not a scalpers paradise but looks promising. Has a little bit of resistance above. would love to hear feedback.

Looks good to me. You'd probably do with a stop loss just below the last low, about 30+ pips. How high a target are you looking at?

HiThanks for sharing. When you reviewed charts from last week over the weekend, I noticed on some charts, what looked like moving averages.(blue lines) Are they MA?Do you use them for the decision process? Or do they give hints For this system?  
Thanks.

30 pip stop loss.... 120 pips would be 4R If it can get past 96.50 (60pips from entry)...Blue skies from there.

I'm not sure what the guidance is for stop loss on 4hr charts. That suggestion was based on a "technical level" seen on the chart -- if that recent low were to be broken, the trend might have changed so we get out. Your views?

If you review post #22 RIFID talks timeframes, though for a 4 hour chart it would equate to a 240 pip SL and a 960 pip target.  
  
Obviously, that is not realistic with this strategy. Heck, I am not sure if 4 hour timeframes will work with this strategy.   
  
So, I agree with Technical stops.

Hi All,  
  
Nice interesting clean system and thread you've got going here. I've read through around half of it.... the back end and the front end. It certainly is very workable and really constitutes breakout trading, where the price returns several times to the same level - these are what you define as the points - and each time it does so, less and less resistance is encountered from those defending that level, be it the bulls or the bears. Ultimately so much pressure has been built up by the side 'attacking' that level that the defending side eventually gives in and so a breakout from the level forms. This is where the momentum forms and hopefully carries you to your 20 pip target as per this system. One of the keys to the success of this system is to trade it when there is volatility in the market. This is because when a 'level' breaks, sufficient volume is required to give it the momentum required to send price action downwards or upwards (by triggering the respective buy and sell orders parked nearby) and thus allow us to reach our 20 pip targets. Hence I'd suggest trading it as much as possible during the London and NY sessions and less so outside of these hours.   
  
It is extremely handy to have so many pairs of eyes looking out for setups of a similar nature on an on-going basis. I am very glad I stumbled across this thread and shall happily devote several hours to it on a daily basis to contribute to the common cause.  
  
Good luck trading everyone  
Lance

I would say that here on the 4hr chart you are simply looking at an uptrend, rather than the formation of a breakout structure as per rifid's rules. The size of the breakout structure itself is much smaller than the uptrend so I would not view them in the same context. There does indeed seem to be resistance parked at the top of it, in line with previous resistance from 13th May or so. I would not go long here until we've seen a clear breach of that resistance. And even once we have, I don't think the rules of this system here are to be applied to that chart, due to the much bigger timeframe involved.  
  
IMO.

Good morning everyone, nice to see you chatting away to each other during the night and discussing setups, a good way to learn of each other. I will get around to answering last nights questions asap. Not a real busy day news wise but maybe just enough to keep the market ticking along. Just remember there is usually a trend happening somewhere so scan all the pairs, as our set ups come from the trends, the moving markets, if your 5m chart looks like its going sideways,squash it up a bit and it may reveal a different picture, good trading to everyone today. Oh and dont forget to share what you find, lets work together as a team so everyone can profit.

My first post on this thread...  
First - Many thanks to rifid, for the time and efforts you put before your fellow trader, for free!   
Second - thanks to the contributors, a very friendly, respectful, nice thread of ideas and communication.  
  
I have subscribed and look forward to contributing.   
  
Here is a snapshot of the EURUSD & USDCHF...  
  
could be a second 'point' unfolding now (one a touch higher, the other a touch lower), so looking a smaller pullback & void at this point.   
looking forward to seeing if it unfolds & everyone's feedback  
  
Thanks again to all for this awesome thread

mmmmmmmm .... never traded it on a 4h before , have not got that much patience, but these setups we are looking for happen on all time frames, so if you see one that takes your fancy . Go for it

Rifid, based on your experience,  
  
1\. How many bars do you prefer between 1st touch, 2nd touch and breakout  
  
2\. What is your preference on how deep the first and second( I know second not as deep as first) retracement should be?

Hello Deanoracer, welcome to the thread and thanks for your charts, they comply to the rules , i have to say not my favourite ones ,but when there is nothing else around ,worth a try. My favourites without a doubt are long consolidations after a trend and then a continuation. Hope you have some success on the site.

It certainly is very workable and really constitutes breakout trading, where the price returns several times to the same level - these are what you define as the points - and each time it does so, less and less resistance is encountered from those defending that level, be it the bulls or the bears. Ultimately so much pressure has been built up by the side 'attacking' that level that the defending side eventually...

Nice post Lancedes, you obviously have studied charts for some time ,as you have cottened on to the theory behind the method straight away.  
Welcome to the thread and look forward to your contributions.

Thanks... Just trying to get out in front of price with early pattern recognition.  
  
The pullback created by point 1 was larger than the others leading to that point, sometimes that can signal the beginning of a longer drawn out consolidation - not always - but sometimes. Based on that I put both pairs on my watch list, and continued scanning charts.  
  
Also these two move in a negative correlation with one another quite often, esp on smaller tf's... often one pair leads & one follows - so one pair can lead the other pair into/out of similar formations. I like to trade the follower!!!  
  
Anyways, both pairs are off the watch list now as the patterns did not continue to materialize.   
Thanks again for allowing me to contribute, I will continue... This is a fine thread you have going here.

Good morning Driven,  
Best way to answer this question is to look at post 680 and also all my charts posted at the beginning of the thread, these are my preferred setups , there is no particular number of Candles required, after some experience you will just get a feel for the market, remember this is not an indicator system that mechanically tells you what trade to put on,...there are plenty of them on F.F. With this method you need to put some chart time in and get into the rhythm and flow of the market and then you will find amazing things start to happen.......It takes time.  
  
Edit: should be post 681 above not 680

Sorry for the late reply, one of my computers just crashed.  
Welcome Orid ,yes that is a correct entry,although you may run into support at the 90 mark so be careful of that.  
Your entry on that seems a little low.  
What i do for my entries ,for a long i make a buy stop order at the top of the points +spread + around .2 pip so if price only wants to come up and test the top and not break thru it wont trigger your order prematually . On a short order i do not factor in spread but just ad around .2 pip for same reason.

As long as your set ups are on the same plane ,if you know what i mean ,this has been mentioned before. Points are not allowed to be in a 'v' pattern formation. make sense?

Yeah the EurAud is such a good trending pair, when you can get a good entry in that in can go a lot more than 20 pips.

Your entry on that seems a little low. What i do for my entries ,for a long i make a buy stop order at the top of the points +spread + around .2 pip so if price only wants to come up and test the top and not break thru it wont trigger your order prematually . On a short order i do not factor in spread but just ad around .2 pip for same reason.

Hey Contrax ,might be best to re-read the thread again, it would take to long to explain what your asking in one post.

Rifid, I have a question please.  
  
Would it be a good idea as a rule, to only take trades going in the same direction as the 1H trend?

You will find that most of your winning trades will be in the direction of the 1h but not all. Also most of your good trades are to be found in the euro and early NY sessions with the occasional one in early asia session.

It might skyrocket because it is correlated with GBP and if the news comes as forecasted. I have moved BE some minutes ago.

I would wait for price to come down to 29 and then form there.

The last retracement could have been better but the resistance was respected pip to pip. Got BE, I need to be more selective I guess, well it happens, Next.

There aren't really any consolidations around at the moment after the gbp data shook up most of the pairs. I think we'll be waiting a fair while for the next ones. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f634.png?v=15.1)

I reckon ea is setting up quite nicely. A level has formed at 1.4410. I expect a down move from this consol level as it has already retested this level twice without breaking it. And the EUR is under enormous selling pressure at the moment.  
  
EDIT: As I wrote, so it broke upwards through that level.

From what I have read and saw, this one would have been skipped because the level is not exact, the second point could be a bit lower but not poking out. Everything is probabilities, trades like these might work out but the probability of this happening might be lower. Don't know, Rifid will explain you a lot better, I am just giving my 2c.

you will see these sort of entries everywhere on your chart they mostly dont work in the long run, they are just entries on pullbacks, trust me i've tried.

On a more serious note..  
  
It is obvious that you look at SR levels and that the point system / line is a SR line that is tested and the trade is on a breakout of the triangle's horizontal line. You also mentioned that you look at the HTF's for trend and confirmation. (Please correct me if I am wrong).  
  
Now the question:  
  
Do you draw SR lines on the HTF to determine the possibility of a 20 pip trade on M5 ? If so, what TF? M15 / H1 / H4 ?

Yes somtimes, i've doing that today ,just marking pivot points that i would like price to come to form a set up, but everytime i did that today price just ran away in the opposite direction. ha so i'll stop doing that now ,today anyway. On days like today you are tempted to take less than good setups but they will usually end badly as the market has got no real solid direction not enough to hold a 20pip trade.

Rifid, would you take that UJ trade if let's say it turn out to be by rules ? We would be trading against the overall trend and we also have 102.2 trouble area. Thanks in advance.  
  
EDIT: Also what do you think about EUR/GBP 8065 blast ?

GJ @ 171.13 also did well but the second point closed higher, it's with overall trend, trouble area only at 170.96, enough space to move SL to BE and the the good looking pressure from upside. Are you riding that one Rifid ?

Answer to your first question probably not ,but it is always appreciated when members share setups,thats what makes this system of trading so effective, it is entirely up to you whether you think there is merit in taking the trade. The euro set up was good but you would run into support around ten points later, with that in mind you could take the trade just to the support area, something is better than nothing, 10pts is still 4% ,an excellent result in any system

The euro set up was good but you would run into support around ten points later, with that in mind you could take the trade just to the support area, something is better than nothing, 10pts is still 4% ,an excellent result in any system

Some pairs are more liquid and volatile than others. To get a 20 pip move on EURGBP is **ALOT** more difficult than it is on GBPJPY! Hence you may want to look into adjusting your sl's and tp's accordingly, depending on which pair you are trading. For example, the yen pairs have more pip movement than any of the other pairs. Depending on the particular setup you're looking at, you may want to even increase that 20 pip profit target and hence increase your reward to risk ratio. Or increase both your stop loss and your profit target and still maintain the ratio at 4. Up to you.

While I appreciate your explanation, I would like to say to you that I have done my ground work, been there, done that. I am not an average Joe in trading, while I am trading on H1, I have decided to learn something more to trade during the day. I hope I did not sound rude and we will continue to contribute to this thread.

Yes, but look at this ..same pair - a loss prior ...If it is wrong setup, Rifid please comment

I believe that the pair was in a downtrend at the time...therefore not a promising setup

This GU setup would have been skipped in my opinion, second point pokes out the resistance and last retracement is lower not higher low. From my backtesting, these may work but the average win% will be low. In the begining, as for myself I would stick to the best setups, putting odds as much as possible in my favour, expecially trading based on something new. As for number of trading setups, you get paid for waiting ya know, heh, just 2c.

Rifid, let me comment on my own chart...my trade was a risky trade, because of resistance....see white line  
  
If you agree with me, does it mean your preference to trade "new" highs/lows and not consolidations on the dip?

I hope you don't mind Driven18 if I share what I see. In my humble opinion the trade was by the rules, you just have to accept that losses happen. Let's see, it was with the overall upside strong trend, the resistance was respected to a pip and there is a pressure of buyers building (higher lows forming). There is a resistance @ 1.6797 but we still would have taken the trade and moved our SL to BE once this area was reached. What you think Driven?

2121, I appreciate your comments, but I remember in one of the posts. Rifid said that he would not take this trade as resistance is less then 20 pips away(in this case only 10 pips away)..so let's see what his comments are on this one..

This might be one forming? Looks like it'd be counter trend but the 1hr trend is down. Might be enough room for a 20 pip drop to the next level of support?

I think it's extremely important to remember the time of day in relation to the pair you are trading...  
  
With GBP I can't help but feel it's more active in the London and London/US overlap compared to the last couple of hours of the US session.

Goodmorning everyone, lets hope for a nice trending day and get some good trades in.  
For you traders out there who lack the patience to wait for 20 pip setups and want the quicker thrill of the scalp, I will bring out the scalpers version of this system later today. Any one interested in that?

Morning Driven, you are right i would have waited for the set up to form at the top so the trade starts in 'clean air', as it turned out there was no set up and price did not go to far before retracing.

Morning/Evening Rifid,  
Maybe not the prettiest P2P, but how do you feel about this one? In my backtesting, U/J didn't fare as well for the 20 pip targets, but it usually always met the height of the triangle formation. This one might be good for 10 if it broke. Not to take away from your 1 to 4 though, I think that is really what makes the system successful, so feel free to send me back to the back of the class ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
I'm interested in your scalping method. Tonight is one of the nights I can't trade Aussie, so I'm always looking for something to fill the gaps.  
Thanks!

Goodmorning Kitara , hav'nt seen you for a while ,Holidays?. Your chart is different to mine so would not even consider taking it ,but your looks ok. Seems mine had a spike at the start of the ozzie session.

Rifid, thank you for comment, so just to confirm, the best set up come from stalling/resisting at the highest highs and lowest lows?

Thats right they have proven to be the best and most reliable ones to get your 20 pips, but it is not unknown to go for a day or so without one. So i will post my scalping version later for the impatient traders who want some action while waiting for these 'prime ' setups

Extended the base a bit and now it has about a 15 pip target. I see what you mean about the spike, it's actually even more pronounced off the broker I do my actual trades with. But MB Trading is what I use for charts and how I backtested, so I'm going for this one. Honestly U/J isn't one of my favorite pairs, but backtesting proved it's workable so maybe I'll end up liking it after all. I'm keeping my pairs down to 6 for this method. I have your original 4 ( I think I know your 4..) and added A/U (my fav) and G/U for spice.

You guys are so quiet tonight, what's up with that?  
Anyone take the E/J? From Rifid and my backtesting, slight up slopes in upper breakouts are good to take. First one was a loss, the 2nd one is in play. Hit the symmetrical target, but E/J is usually always good for at least 20. Target the last S/R line from hourly chart which is in pink.

S/R target on the E/J 1hour hit as I typed that last post. Hope Rifid agrees with my entry. It worked out for me. Backtesting really does help, and taught me to squish up my charts more. The dark gray is hours I don't trade, but the light grey is when I come online and look at possible P2P setups, which could have lines to make in the dark grey. Which is almost everytime by the way.. If you're backtesting, this might help you too. I need beauty sleep so trading 24/7 isn't possible, this gives you a realistic view of what is attainable in the hours you're awake.

Well, you would have got the 20 on E/J. So don't listen to me on symmetrical, ever! lol. Okay, maybe on u/j.. that one still has me playing triangle heights. But E/J has been quite the producer this week.   
Rifid, are you typing up your scalping method? If I'm going to hang out and trade overnight, which I think I will... I'll need to be highly caffeinated. I been doing this for about 10 years, so I can do patience but you might get some whacked out comments from me as I adjust my sleep schedule. U/J is moving on up, I'm in that one.

Yes, they are slightly different. So I have some crutches. I use a 100 simple MA to determine long term trend, and fractals to draw my lines with. Here is my current E/J chart with the P2P. The first entry was a loss, the 2nd one went for the 20.  
What is your moving average?

I don't know why you originally chose the yen pairs, but I have to tell you.. I've become a fan of them for this method. Looking at U/Cad, which I'm fond of too... for different reasons, I never expect too much from it. My husband is Canadian and I'm American, so we exchange money all the time. Here is what I'm seeing thought chart wise, are you seeing this too? For US/CADs, this is our sleeping time so I'm not expecting too much. If it breaks, then I will bow down, but I will just sit on the sidelines and try to learn a lesson with this one ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

This is another low volatility pair, so I would treat it like U/J, go for the triangle of 14 pips. Okay, now saying that, I have been around the FF block and know how important MM is. So the 1:4 RR really does make a difference. LOL, please don't send me to the back of the class! I'm going to ask personal questions now, why did you and your wife choose the xxx/yen pairs. Why now after opening this thread are you looking at others? I know first hand that patience is hard, but 3 - 8 trades a week isn't bad when you have a good chance of coming out ahead. I trade 1:2 for my aussie system, and my growth account rate is positive but has to be slower then yours. So patience does pay off. Anywho, I stick to my original comment that these setups can be fun and addictive, but you do need how to do them right

okay, I'm going to set my U/J targets and let it ride or bust out. U/J loves symmetricals, so hopefully it won't disappoint!

Thats a good question, i chose the 4 yen pairs after a lot of trial and error , for a number of reasons , the pairs had to have a low spread ,so no exotics ,they needed to get to t/p in fastest time and have good volume, although all the main pairs do have good setups and get to 20 pips during times of heavy trending,they just dont do it as often as the yen pairs.  
Also with this system ,to get the best out of it you need to get into the rythem of that particular pair and it is very difficult to do when you are flip flopping thru a dozen pairs all the time, so we have just one pair each on 4 computers that way you can keep an eye on the flow of each pair fairly easily. But i must say with everybody helping each other on here it opens up a whole lot more trade oportunities for everyone, than you could possibly do by yourself.

Hi rifid. Just expressing some of my opinions. If price above pivot only look for long, if below only look for shorts. It seems to save me from a lot of fake outs. TP should be adjusted according to the ADR of pairs. EU, GU, AU, UJ with 150 points and EJ, GJ at 200 points.  
  
Just my 2cents. Cheers.

UP to you to try that, the most IMPORTANT thing is to only take the QUALITY entries. Your trades need space to be able to get to T/P without hitting s/r

Sounds great.  
I'm in too..  
And I'm working on a EA about your strategy. It's a little hard cause the trend line and resistent line is subjective. It just alerts us .and finally make decision depend on us.

Great mate, so far I am just training my eyes to recognize high probability setups. On H1 I trade only with S/R and P/A so I hope it will not take that much to get used to it.

Hey Rifid, what's the diff between this 1:4 system and your scalping system? Is it simply that the r:r is 1:1 instead of 1:4? Are the setups that we are looking for the same? And same entry and exit rules? It appears that way to me after reading through it on post #1. Please correct me if I'm missing something.

It was ,we were just talking about that trade,voided now, but had huge s/r band all through the left of the chart, so was a bit dicey to start with.

Pretty much,but the scalping method is good to use in range bound markets like yesterday or nice setups that have S/R in the way of getting to 20 pips. Just an extra op. to make some pips and keep brain active. You can have a play around with the trade parameters to suit, just makesure the setups are nice and clean and you should do alright with it.

If G/U gets back down to 6820 I guess it might try and go on down to retest the 6800 level? Looks like a small head and shoulders has formed too? But I suppose the set up is far from ideal and it's against the short term trend.

Yip, that's an awesome setup. CADJ is in much the same position now on the daily. Just needs to bust up through that 94 barrier

NU broke resistance, skip. Take a look EU @ 43671, might form something there, so far not much sellers pressure.

EJ @ 138 but many trouble areas all the way down, not even space for a scalp.

CJ @ 93.627 might work out as a scalp because of support @ 93.541.  
  
EDIT: The trade looked good but probably not a great idea to trade in the end of NY session, especially to scalp.

Good morning everyone, fairly quiet in the market last few hours, although there was some good trades around in the late euro and early NY session, both scalps and 20 pippers, did anyone get them. Good luck with your trading today guys, remember one good trade a day is all you need so dont force the market they will allways produce something.  
Heres a hint TRy concentrating on one pair only, get to know it ,own it, know all its little habits ,its patterns that seem to repeat over and over, each pair have there own personality and before you know it you will just about be able to predict every little twist and turn it makes and profit from it.

Just be careful if you are tempted to trade the g/j long as you will run straight into strong resistence on the 1h, look for a possible bounce down and maybe a quick scalp if a nice set up presents itself.

Some setups that occured during the euro session.  
The 20pipper on the a/u ,once triggered price shot up 10 pips then came back and retested your entry{ this is why you dont go to B/E to early} then eventually made its way to T/P.

This one could have been taken for a scalp or a 20 pip depending on your preference, notice the previous peak had been rejected big time of that 102.143 level then came down and formed a P to P , very strong signal to watch for .

Because of the big movement in the gbp today do you think it has the strength to shoot through that massive resistance. look at the daily chart its the same setup just on a massive scale...

Ha ha ,little slip there, thats ok make it your own. Funny things about charts ,the more you look at them the more you start to see things you have never seen before and trades just start comming out of the woodwork. Thats the problem with most people they just jump from one chart to another yet still seem to miss all the good trading ops, you just need to slow down get into the rythem of just one or two pairs and get to know them like old friends, then they will reveal many secrets to you.  
That is how you become worlds best trader.

It may just trade in a channel for a while untill it sorts itself out, if thats the case scalping ops. may present themselves, have an open mind.

Anyone get this next scalp on ,2 in a row on same pair, this is what i mean about concentrating on just 1 or 2 pairs and getting into the rhythm and flow of the market and the trades will come. Also the g/j broke out of consolidation for a very quick 20pips.

As I understand, the idea behind the points is that if the second point closes lower than previous in an up trend let's say, it just shows that the buyers are not strong enough to push the price higher. Rifid ?

I have just found over the years, that if each consecutive smaller retracement can reach the top line you have drawn you will have much higher success in the long run, you will easily find in backtesting that the ones that line up perfectly always perform better. If the last one is slightly higher it also shows there is increasing buyer pressure. Reverse for shorts of course.

I took 4 of them some with half position size. Yes it was risky but i felt the yen was weakening, owell gotta risk it to get the biscuit. Scored 158 pips which was a nice way to end the week.

It's great that it worked very well this time but if the opposite would had occurred all the pairs would follow to your SL. But still great trades. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

I concur with your comments 2121, however this is a high risk v reward s system, if all four failed then it only takes1 more win to make up the loss, worth the risk ? Yes. But having said that ,me not being the greedy type would be more than happy with 2

That was a nice breakout north at 10182 about 5 hours ago. looks like it could be set to break south through that level again. Need to assess jpy strength across the board.

Hi, I just wondered what time session over the years the best setups form? I am trying (trying being the ultimate word) to trade full time so I can trade whatever time really (live in UK) I often wake up to find decent setups happen in the asian session?  
  
I got burnt on EurJpy, tried to force the setup which was never there...  
  
Thanks for any help,

Just had another look at that a/u and if you ignore that little poke thru there ,you had 3 beautifully lined up points, so it would be tempting to take.

Already mentioned the 2 pin point before. I took the short setup on the last little poke & stopped out for -5p.  
Do you consider to re-enter if the setup line pierced again?

First chart. Is this a valid setup? or does it have to be with the trend?  
I'm not clear what the exact rules and criteria are.

Win rate on these scalps is entirely up to your experience in finding the good setups and reading the chart rhythm, i've had 6 in the last couple of days for 5wins and a loss.

Thank you for your answer ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1). Then AU should be a 3R win if I re-enter.

So, is that a yes? The points are in the same plane...   
  
this thread is already 48 pages and looking like a pm chat... It would be greatly appreciated if at least on the first page there were clear rules written out with some example charts.

Some news came on the wires about troops mobilising in Iraq. Market environment seems to have turned risk off as a result.

Yea, most have done that at some point and reached exhaustion...   
Actually, I have read a few pages, and its tough trawling through all the irrelevant material; comments about trying to upload a chart, etc... I simply haven't found THE RULES with examples clearly and concisely laid out... I got a piece here and another there. Based on that I posted a chart asking whether it was a valid setup to know whether I had understood something of what I had read, because, even after reading rules however clear, practicing and getting it right is another thing still regardless. It just makes it easier... So, I still don't know whether it is 'yes' or 'no'

Actually, I have read a few pages, and its tough trawling through all the irrelevant material; comments about trying to upload a chart, etc... I simply haven't found THE RULES with examples clearly and concisely laid out... I got a piece here and another there. Based on that I posted a chart asking whether it was a valid setup to know whether I had understood something of what I had read, because, even after reading rules however clear, practicing and getting it right is another...

IMHO there has to be another one point formed and after that a lower high, the first point is not in this plane.  
  
EDIT: Also it's a CT, so lower odds..  
  
EDIT2: Your SL needs to be constant 5 pips.

Take a look at the first page... rules are there. Next few pages are followed by examples

Too choppy & stick to 173 BRN, maybe waiting for USD news in 25 mins.  
Besides, there's no 2nd point formed atm.

Yeh been watching this for awhile but starting to think its going to stay in range. Have a look at the daily chart, lots of resistance.  
  
maybe good for a scalp but doubt its got much distance in it. But then again i might be completely wrong

I never entered it. I wanted to, but got sidetracked at the time. So I would have entered it if I'd been watching. It went up around 15 pips and then came crashing down. A good lesson.... at least move stop to BE after a certain point.  
  
Have yourself a good wend.

Hello Driven,  
  
This system works well. It requires a level of awareness that comes with any strategy that produces good results. I think the only real "problem" with this style of trading is that it's deceptively easy. Without a trained eye, you can see literally hundreds upon hundreds of setups on your chart. The key is training your eye to spot the actual setups. I think you'll find that's how people end up being profitable with any system or trading in general: systems that seem mechanical are actually discretionary. I struggled with this concept for a long time, but once I realized that all you have to do is learn how to anticipate a chart, you can make any decent system work for you.  
  
Here are some tips:  
1\. Pull up all the charts rifid says are great setups and study those. Any time you think you have a setup, cross-check it with those charts. Are you really trading a great setup?  
2\. Learn how to identify trends, spot important S/R levels, and read price action. I honestly don't think it's possible for anyone to make long-term money in the markets if they can't do these things, no matter what/how they claim to trade.  
3\. Start anticipating. Think you have spotted a trade but it really isn't great? Don't trade it, but instead anticipate what you think price will do. Keep doing this over and over again. If you honestly just sit on your hands and watch price, you'll develop a very intuitive feel for the markets. This is what makes real traders profitable. Once you can intuit the markets, it's much easier to make a system work for you. You will also be able to take some of the more questionable setups then, because you know how to evaluate market conditions properly. This is a skill that takes a while to develop, but it's the real holy grail of Forex.  
  
I think most people get caught in the idea that there exist simple systems that can make them money. If this were the case, everyone would be using them. This strategy is fantastic once you learn the real skill of trading, which is developing a feel for the markets. All good trading is discretionary in nature.  
  
Anyway, that's just my take on things. Sorry for the long post. If you find this too controversial, I'll be happy to take it down, rifid ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1). I'm an intraday trader who only trades GJ, and this system seems like the perfect fit. I need something to do while I'm waiting for those 30 min and hourly bars to fill. Have been following this thread for a week or so, but hope to get actively involved with you all on Monday.  
  
Have a great weekend!  
  
Best,

ElecrtoGypsy, good stuff...  
  
Opposite for me...I trade EA that I have designed...it takes trades everyday on 1Hr and 4Hr basis...automatic and successful(fingers cross or knock on wood)...no more brains involve(took only 10 years in and out of the Forex) but still looking and researching...I love it....so I am of the opinion if technique has an edge per certain rules, every trade must be taken as per rules, as one never know which one will make it a winner...losses short, profits run...well you all know what I mean...so I prefer to take every set up automatically..

Hello Electro gypsy,  
An excellent post ,from obviously an experienced trader, and in full agreement. Welcome to the thread.  
  
  
F.F. provides a wealth of information to the thousands of new and old traders that visit every day in the hope of finding the secret to their financial future, and thinking that a quick flick thru the trading system pages will make them rich in super quick time with the minimum of effort, generally what they are presented with is system after system full of indicators, making charts look pretty and very 'professional' so they try one ....dos'nt seem to work, find another, play with that for a few days or weeks.....dosnt work either, and before you know it traders can spend months even years flip flopping from one indicator based system to another and wonder why they just cant get them to work as promised. Many go away totally disalusioned,and think that making money from trading is just not possible, which is just not  
true.  
Trading success is very much based on the attitude of the individual, if you come into it with the attitude that it is a get rich quick toy and just want an indicator based system that will tell them when to put a trade on and without any input from the trader is just kidding themselves,if it exsists let me know, the owner of it will make a fortune selling it and F.F probably wouldnt exist.  
Truth is any indicator based system will not work without a working knowledge of the markets, how patterns form and why ,the flow of certain pairs at certain times etc etc. Becoming a longterm profitable trader does not happen overnight ,sorry, it takes time and a solid commitment to succeed.  
If you really want to to trade indicator based systems you need to learn first by trading naked charts , learn support and resistence , one of the most powerful trading tools to know. Then, if you must, apply some indicators, but what you will find will happen is your attention to chart flow is totally taken away by the distraction of the indicators, combining indicators and naked chart trading is very difficult to do, try it.  
If you learn to trade naked charts well, truth is you will never need or want another lagging indicator polluting your chart ever again and the power that comes from that both financially and emotionally is wonderful.  
You must decide as a trader, do want to be really successful at this or is it just a fun hobby to fill some free time in, if it is the former you need to start with the basics of trading, naked charts.  
The method of trading being presented here may not suit everybody, but the knowlege that can be learnt from studying these pages and reading from the various contributors will help enormously in your trading venture. Good trading to all.

Was live testing this method for the whole of last week.  
  
I did not use the risk of 2%:8% as I am more conservative and is "trying out" the system and overall it gave me +5% last week after many weeks of negative return, be it live or demo.  
  
Think it work best on trend continuation. Means, when the system is right the first time on the same day, it will most probably right for 2nd and 3rd time on the same day, in the same direction.  
  
Thanks a lot. Guessed everything has been laid out clearly and precisely.

Good morning all, lets hope this week brings good fortune to everyone.  
Here was a lovely quick scalp on the u/j to start the week off.  
You wiil notice the candles where in a nice down trend then an out of character retrace up which was rejected very quickly, came down to prev. low ,overshot it a bit ......good sign. then did a mini 2 candle retrace retrace then down for 5 pip scalp, there was plenty of room for a scalp but not for 20 pips as there were s/r down further. Keep a close eye on your chart as these little gems can just appear out of nowhere, but are surprisingly common.

Good morning rifid. Do you have another mechanical rules (besides SR & BRN) that can help you to determine when to scalp & when to aim for 4R ?  
  
Currently on this one.

Because I don't know definitely when to scalp or go for 20, I choose middle approach. Partial TP @ 6 pips (1 pip for commision) & let the rest go for 20. But that's just me. I want to hear your opinion about how we determine potential TP for any particular trade. I've already read the post back, but it's still unclear for me ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f62b.png?v=15.1).

Probably the easiest way for me to answer that is if you get a NICE setup {see my posted charts} and there is room to go to 20pips without hitting s/r go for 20, if not just go for scalp ,5 pips.  
If you look at all my posted chart examples you will notice that they are very clean in there make up ,not 'pinny' candles. You get much better results with these, you need to be patient but you will see many like this during the day.

Hi guys!  
  
I'm new to FF and fx trading. Still trying to figure out what style suits me best. I like to think I'm a scalper at heart, but so far I've found the lower TF's very intimidating. Been browsing the forums a couple months to see if any strategies resonated with me and this is the first thread that has prompted me to actively participate.  
  
Thanks rifid! I've learned about chart patterns, but don't have the experience yet to spot them consistently, and even when I do I'm not completely sure how to trade them... until I found this thread a couple days ago. Now I know exactly how to trade a wedge (pennant?) on the 5M charts. Definitely wanna join you guys in the hunt!

Morning, UJ @ 101.752 might form something but only for a scalp, looks smooth by the way.  
  
EDIT: No retrace, so no go.

Because S/R is subjective in nature, going for 5 pips or 20 pips become subjective too. I'll make small research this week to find what kind of mechanical criteria that could be used to determine to go for a scalp or full 4R. Thank you rifid.

Pips please dont apply an indicator to this method, it is not what its about. If you find that you need an indicator to tell you where S/R levels are perhaps this type of trading is not for you.

So far I haven't seen any quality setups, maybe the NU .8686 scalp but the shape was not great.

Easy man, I won't ruin this thread with additional useless indicator ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/270c-fe0f.png?v=15.1). This method is fine. I only want to make things clear since you introduce scalping type trading on page 1. You've already give us warning too when using scalping type trade.

Agreed. I think the point of the scalping strategy was that it's for anyone who's doesn't have the time to wait for 200 pips to occur or want to trade CT. To the best of my knowledge, the scalping strategy still requires that you have to wait for the same quality setups as the 200 pip setups.

Hi rifid, thank you for your reply. Mind if i ask a question here. "all points must be on the same plane/ trend line" means that it should not make a higher high like this chart?

The ideal setup is lower high at trend line like this?

Will you take the trade on the second chart where the first low point is like 20 hours before? Sorry for the ugly photoshop.

Nice. I'm watching a similar setup on GU. My hunch is that if that if sellers break the 5 min support, the gap will be filled. Should be a quick scalp if it happens.

Oops...meant 20 pips. The 5 digit broker stuff still messes with my head. 1:40 RR would be great though! I'm sure the principle holds for those 200 pip moves though too ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

F.F. provides a wealth of information to the thousands of new and old traders that visit every day in the hope of finding the secret to their financial future, and thinking that a quick flick thru the trading system pages will make them rich in super quick time with the minimum of effort, generally what they are presented with is system after system full of indicators, making charts look pretty and very 'professional'...

good one, I too go the indicator way at first, flipfloping from one to another, the reason maybe because it is easier to watch indicator cris-crossing, change color and then open position  
after about 1 year I realize that all indicator use some kind of formula that is taking some period of price than calculate it, plot to chart, give colors etc, there's no way that it can move market  
since then I learned anything that I can find about PA and It is not easy at all compared to just watching indicators 

In the end its just a stupid numbers game

That GBPUSD one would have been great! It finally broke the 1.70 mark. And very quickly back down again.

Hey Orid,  
  
I see both of those setups. They seem technically to be valid, although they don't seem to be very clean scalps. The EJ setup is trading into consolidation (there isn't any sort of strong trend present), and UJ is around some 4hr resistance. That's just my take though. They are possible trades strictly speaking (I think).   
  
Best,

Hi rifid, some question if you don't mind.  
Is this kind of thing that you mean 'pinny' candles?

Shape is nice but in my data feed, the second point closed higher, it's a CT trade but enough space for 4:1. I passed it.

Looking at the AJ @ 95.58, good for a 4:1, support @ 95.397, or the CJ @ 93.712 but only for a scalp, support is 8 pips lower. Of course nothing formed there so far but overall shape might look good.

I'm watching AJ too. CJ the 2nd point is higher, so not valid.

I believe several in on the GU, but yes, I completely agree. Don't see any other setups present. My guess is today will be more of a consolidation day given the moves we saw on Thursday and Friday across most pairs. Just gotta wait for the easy ones. Best of luck to you.

Not on the same plane, search the thread, use keyword "plane". Of course, don't blindly trust me I may be wrong.

Only taken me 2 hrs to load this, sorry if it looks a bit scrappy. But it shows the main setups we are looking for. i'll go thru them one by one.  
  
No 1. Standard setup in up/down trend ,second point can be slightly higher but not lower.  
  
No3. My favourite and most successful setup, points forming a long consolidation of a longer term trend,can have multiple in- line points.  
  
No2. THIS IS NOT A VALID SETUP, you cannot combine points from both up/down trends ,this is a reversal pattern like head and shoulders,not part of this method.  
  
No4. This is a setup just after a change of trend, as long as the points are on the same plane/trend it is valid.  
  
Pick the clean , pure versions of these and you should be right to go. Easy eh.

Rifid,   
  
Thank you for the chart. It's very helpful. What are your thoughts about the GU trade earlier? Did you take it? If not, what was your reasoning? Just trying to get a good understanding how you approach your own strategy.   
  
Best,

No i didnt take it as i was busy doing other things, but i would have for a scalp only as there was support close by. the second point was slightly higher but not enough to void the trade .

After the 2nd point the retrace was comming down for an entry but didnt make it then price turned and made a higher high before coming back to entry line. You want to look for a smooth retrace, does that make sense?

Yes nice clean setup, infact if you go out to a 1h chart you would have found plenty of room for a 20 pipper.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

well said, the worst thing you can do is trade out of desperation, if there's nothing there find something else to do , easy. Never force a trade guys it will always end badly for you.

That's great to hear man. I just read the entire thread, your method is just what I have been looking for. I really like how it involves Support and resistance/Breakouts, looking forward to seeing how I get on with this ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
I'll try post a few screenshots soon and share with the group, thanks to everyone that contributed so far.

Still having Skype problems here too - I can send IM's to Rifid but can't see the group messages. Think it might be a problem with my Windows 8.1 but i'll keep trying to fix it.

thread is still open gareth i am advised of all messages, when you are familiar with the method you can ask to join the skype group ,it has 50+ members.

Sounds interesting indeed but I still dont get why dont you have an EA ?  
Is it a manual process ? if so why dont you get an EA that alerts you of possible setup and then you decide what to do. you would be able to monitor much more pairs, and would rely on anyone else - you could still have a community sharing the good setup.  
  
Thanks

I am new to this thread but the rules say that 1) the points have to be on same trend and for a setup to be valid.  
2)For a short setup, point 2 must be the same value ( or slightly less than) point 1.  
Similar but reversed comments for next example.

I see what you are saying Mb206, and while it is a attractive to have an EA, it really would only be a rough alerts system at best (for this method..) We want to take the clean setups only and this is requires a level of discretion, this setup is not mechanical, there are a few nuances involved. So all an EA would ever be, is a small heads up alerts system, at best, in my opinion. An EA may potentially promote certain traders to take less than average entries unless they understand the setup properly anyway (you never know.)  
  
Even with an EA, you would still have to review the higher times frames and the information to the left of your chart, that is what is important, so we can see if there is a proper setup there or if we are in an area we seriously do not want to be in.. and bare in mind, once you understand a setup like this, you can glance at a chart and figure out if something is there or not right away anyway, which you could then calculate better than any EA ever could.

The second point is less then a pip lower... does this qualify ??  
  
Also how much higher should the entry be from the S&R line... Like maybe one pip ??

No and no. Last chart looks good. Refer to rifid's posts 1052 and 1054.

UJ looks like setting up, presently making pt2. Let's see if it gives us a small retrace afterwards and bam!

Aussie has made a (lower) pt2. Looks like it'll trigger very soon; but gotta drop about 2 pips lower to get past recent swing low. After that, blue skies ahead ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

I don't see the group as well, only rifid's contact (as [tradersgroup3](skype:tradersgroup3)). Just read that group chats aren't supported any more since Skype 4.0, so not sure if this is the problem we are seeing???

I reckon this would be considered a discretionary trade (under this method), as entry came very late after pt 2 formed. But technically, it's a with-trend trade with low risk imho. Your thoughts, rifid and other traders?

Your EUR/USD looks like a perfect set-up to me. Unfortunately, I missed it. I am in USD/JPY, but I was probably a bit hasty as it is not the best of set-ups.

Hi bobbles  
  
I took the UJ trade as well but got kicked out at S/L ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1) It went just a pip lower and now has gone north. Oh well...

I put the SL at 10202, just under the swing low, so my risk is 7 pips (entry at 10209). I must admit I am not trading it quite like rifid. I have put 2 lots on, one to close at 1:1, the other at 4:1.

Hi Amanfx  
  
I believe there was a setup just before CAD news broke, as depicted. I would have taken the trade given the trend bias, like you've mentioned. Would you?

Thanks PipsiKoala.  
I think your USD/CAD would have been a valid set-up. I would have taken it if I had spotted it, except that I don't trade this pair. My spread-betting provider (IG Index) once widened the spread on a trade on this pair and stopped me out. I could find no justification for this (news, etc.).

Is the entry point 1 pip + spread above/below the established line? Thanks!

hi paracelsus... from what i understand from the first post is the entry is the value of the spread plus .2 of a pip above or below the top or bottom level  
  
quote..  
  
ENTRIES:  
Once you have found a suitable entry , set your Buy Stop at the top point plus your spread {max 1.5} plus .2 pip then . Your t/p is 5 pips above this.  
Example Top of point is 138.32 + .9 spread +.2 = entry price of 139.42.  
For sell we only ad .2 to point value.  
Stop loss is set at same time as Buy/Sell order.

Just to clarify, the spread is only added to your entry if you are going long. If short, only add the 0.2. This is so you are only "paying" for the spread one way per trade.

Quotes on MT4 are printed using the Bid price. So when you are Long, you have to add the spread with 2 points above the high price. You will actually be entering 2 points above the high price. If you did not add the spread when Long, you will in fact entering below the high price. For eg Price is 1.35000 + spread 10 +2 points. You place a buy stop at 1.35012.  
  
When you are short, due to the bid price on chart, there is no need to add the spread. The spread will come in when you are exiting your short. Pay attention to your chart when the set your TP when Shorting. Price will have to actually pass the TP line including your spread. So placing a sell stop with low at 1.35000 will be 1.34998.

It's always good to have more pairs of eyes watching, so we can learn from our mistakes in applying the system. Care to highlight and share what you saw wrong?

how do you define the trend on the 5m chart ? how many previous bars do you look at to establish the trend ?  
  
or do you look at the higher tf to determine the days trend ¬ remember the rend is different on each time frame.  
  
on your first chart in post # 45. there was a long entry that met your criteria before the long entry you took. to the left, the very first two highest highs. the two points of high. immediately after which a long entry would have been triggered and subsequently stopped out.

re. the first chart in post #45, it looks to me as though the second of the two highs you refer to is not quite as high as the first. Post 44 makes this point.

sorry i meant to say that there are 3 high points there, and it is the 2 high points after the frst high point i was referring to. i.e. the 2nd and 3rd high points. these two met the criteria, but a long would have lost.  
  
  
just curious to know why rfld did not take that trade.

Hello Pipsi,  
  
It's hard going into detail about every single chart, but what 2121 says is correct. Pull up all of rifid's charts and compare them to the ones posted. Always always always price needs to be heading _closer_ towards your resistance/support level. In all of Aman's charts, price makes an arbitrary low, retraces higher than the previous high before that arbitrary low was made, and then comes down and makes a second point. That does not show increasing buying/selling pressure, which is what we are looking for.  
  
The only charts that aren't breaking this rule are the ones you have posted, but in those cases price has only made one point (over the span of two bars. You still need to let price test come and make a second test of the level) or the levels are sloppy. As a general rule, draw your resistance line from the _first_ low, not the second (as you did in post #1178). It's fine if price dips slightly beneath your line on the second point of contact, but you want price at least to touch the line the second time. There are times when it's ok to trade sloppier levels, but it's important to trade the system in it's purest form and get that right before moving on to the more difficult setups. Even if you stick with looking only for A+ trades, you'll get enough to make your account grow rapidly every week.  
  
Every system has its strengths and weaknesses. When you trade a 5 minute system, you open yourself up to the possibility of overtrading like crazy. Not every S/R you see is an opportunity. Do not force setups. Rifid states that he was only taking 3-8 trades per week. Since we are still learning this system, we should be taking even less than that.  
  
I'm reattaching this picture of how setups should look. Use this as a guide when making trading decisions. These are the A+ setups when taken with the primary trend.  
  
Best,  
EG

Hi Electro

What I tried to show on my charts are the (minimum) 2 points that constitute support or resistance -- I've labeled them as "1" and "2". I drew a horizontal line across pt 2 to indicate that a trade would be on if that line was breached. Perhaps I should have drawn it across pt 1 and the picture might become clearer, such that we see at least 2 points touching the line, or a latter point popping out slightly (which is ok by rifid rules).

Sorry Pipsi, I missed that chart of yours. Good work! That was a solid setup (in my opinion). The 15 min and 1hr charts provided nice background for the trade. The only real negative to the setup was that the overall hourly trend was up. It looks like it got close to the +20 target, but was shy by a few pips. I know how that feels.  
  
It seems that when price makes a slightly lower low (as it did on pt 2), rifid will place his entry 0.2 pips below that low. Whether or not it makes that much of a difference is debatable, but it does technically assure a break of the lowest low. It sounds like that's what you did.  
  
  
I don't take the scalps with this system anymore, but you may want to consider taking only +5 on setups like that in the future, since it was CT. Again, that's just my opinion. Do what's best for you ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1). I'm sure rifid will offer much better commentary when he returns.  
  
Best,

Until Rifid comes back, I could try to help you out folks with finding the correct entries. Post charts and I will try to give my perspective on them when I have time. I am still not an expert on this method but I have already managed to make some money. And also, don't be lazy and read the whole thread a few times, I have also bookmarked all important posts.

Not a 4:1 trade, and news was ahead, you don't wan't to be trading just before the news with a 5 pip SL and on my data feed the second point closed lower.

Your entry looks close to what we are trying to find but still has some nuances.Yeah, no trades from me today, my last one was yesterday AJ @ 95.54, got a 4:1..

hi jymarc ..i dont know how your trade went mate ..good i hope ...the entry wasnt strictly to the criteria as i see it ..  
the pullback off point 2 rose above the previous tops so making it a notrade for what what rifid looks for ..  
just for education purposes ....all the best.

Hi, you must take the candle high not close/open, then the second point would be lower. If you flip to H1, you would find out a resistance @ 1.36511 and last it is end of NY session and it's friday.

Hi, I personally did not find any trades today, but I usually leave the desk before LC on fridays. Talking about NU trade, if you flip to H1 you would see that PA is iffy and no clear direction, you would also find a support level @ 0.8766 clearly visible even from the M5. The setup was close but it seemed to me a bit too steep.

2121 ..thanks for feedback ..certainly reasons not to take the trade ...but as always the market does what it wants and was targeting the 53 support level ..  
GU ...i was eyeing this one up earlier before it broke higher but decided it was friday evening so left alone ..even so worked out ..this looked valid to me... may disagree ..uptrend with pullback and bounce of round number and pressure building on point one ..have good weekend .

Hi rifid and all contributors and thank you.  
  
On pg 13, post #244 "hg2014" posted a diagram which was consistent with my concept of the set up you are showing us.  
  
Post #250 from "mc19" shows the chart below;  
  
to which your response was (post #252);  
"Yeh there was a very quick entry there, may reform for another yet"  
  
If you have time, would you please show me (us) the "Quick Entry" you mentioned.  
  
I have marked up the chart with my interpretation of what I've read up to pg 14 & the last three pages.  
  
Thanks,  
Darryl

rifid, or someone else that is certain of this answer;  
  
• Mention is made to "pinny" candlesticks. Does this observation apply to pins in both directions or only pins which seem to get rejected at each attempt to break the price level for entry?  
  
I have my own ideas on this however clarification from you would be much more valid than my thoughts.

You will also notice that the last retracement is fairly pinny which is usually not a good sign but in this case you can see each of the candle sticks ends down in a hangman style fashion indicating that the sellers are stronger than the buyers ,then the buyers finnally give up and the price crashes thru your entry and hits your T/P in less than 5min, The charts i have shown...

In case I missed this:  
1\. Is there any guide or restriction on the number of bars between points? Can it be as few as 2 bars?  
2\. How about the width of the "void"? Can the void be a much greater number of bars than between the points?  
I look forward to anyone's reply.

There is no restriction on the number of bars between points as can be seen in the chart examples I have posted, the last retrace before breakout will nearly always be smaller than previous and definetly lower,[for short], last retrace can be as few as 3 bars as long as a void is formed.

When i refer to 'pinny' candles i am refering to largish wicks both top and bottom, indicating indecision in the market and best to stay out.

FWIW:  
  
After reading every post I'd say that this looked to me like a valid set up as per my interpretation of rules.  
  
1\. Not all set ups end in victory.  
2\. An area of congestion at this level, from last Wednesday.  
3\. Friday's AU range was met at today's reversal level.  
and  
4\. Price reversed at precisely today's S2 pivot based on NY close.

Tried to PM you booker but your messaging is turned off.  
  
It seems as though the skype room is broken. Updates are extremely slow, and today it went 6 hours without a post. It could be that there is a virus present in the room, so I bailed. I'm certain it will get sussed out, but at this time, you're missing nothing.

Here is ChfJpy trade I attempted (-5) about 2 hrs after London Open.  
  
• White line just below upper 'X' is the level I chose.   
• Orange line show trend  
• Entry taken as pin bar breached white line.  
• Sidebar #'s are greater than 5  
  
Now, here is what was not perfect:  
• The level I chose had 3rd pt. (upper white X next to R1 Pivot) almost 1p less than previous 2pts.  
• Lower X, next to upper green arrow on right shows Lower Low by less than 0.5p.  
\--> Other than that, price had been making Higher Lows.  
  
Non Thread support for this trade was;  
• Price had bounced off of previous days high after taking hours to break through.  
• Price had only fulfilled approx 1/2 of previous days range.  
  
Jaime informed me this was not a valid set up. Fair enough. Am wondering if his observations were anything like what I just mentioned.

Hi Diamond,  
  
Although alot earlier in the day there is a valid setup on the same chart which would of been a winner.  
  
If you took the breakout just after your second green arrow. This was a perfect setup.  
  
You have a horizontal level that is holding (your red line), a series of lower lows (your green arrows), and then the breakout occurs. It doesn't quite make 20 pips then retraces to entry point and then moves higher to hit TP. It is also with the trend.  
  
With your setup there was only one touch of the horizontal support line (needs minimum of 2) and there was only 1 lower low that formed.  
  
Hope this helps out  
  
Justin

agree with white ..saw the perfect set up when looked at your chart and was confused when you said it was a loser ..then read your post regarding  
the other trade taken above which lost ..easy to see when you take a step back ..not so when your scanning a lot of charts .practice and patience are definately  
needed ...

Sorry mate, but all I can say is that you are well over-complicating things what to look for and it'a a common habit, a bad one. Go over Rifids uploaded charts and take them with a clear H1 trend, and make sure there is no S/R ahead on H1. Also, the more things you will count, the harder it will be to pull the trigger.

The first point doesn't count because it's from down trend. If you zoom out a bit you will see that you are fighting a trend and at some point it will resume down again, looks like it took a plunge. In general, there was nothing.

If you miss a trade, you also miss a loser as well and it's just numbers game. I zoomed out and I coudn't see a trend there, it was flat, when I switched to H1 there were 3 support levels just a few pips away one from another. The line was untidy, you have to put a line by the lowest low, in general it was a random trade and if anyone took it and won it was pure luck.

Regarding post #1268 from Booker, this does not look like a trend trade. Price was going up. Then it dropped only 10 pips. Why would this be a valid trade?

hey diamond i can totally see why youd not take it as valid ..im not saying it was an a1 setup ...as in a steady 5min trend ...i saw it more as trend reversal  
on the 5min chart following the underlying downtrend... on the larger timeframes ... trend reversals setups are still valid i believe albeit this one was in the early stages of one ..maybe too soon for some .. the structure of the triangle wasnt bad and it broke down nicely ..only the NFP announcement stopped it hitting the 20pip area i believe but you could have got out before with pips ... heres a 4hr chart with downward trendline and other confluences to back the short trade ..in the end its my opinion and its good to get constructive critisism ...all the best . sorry RIFID for clogging up your thread ....

Diamond is right here, it was only good for a scalp and it was pinny and messy, you need to have clean and clear PA to put the best odds in your favour.

Maybe I can offer a developing pattern in the eurnok **daily** chart for scrutiny. I'm an elliott wave trader, and from that perspective I would guess the wave up will follow through after a pullback to about 8.30

You are spamming the thread by posting this way. While I understand your charts, others will not, so it would be nice if you post only clean and clear ones. Don't mix the original method with your own experience here.

Having a daily target makes no sense at all, you might encounter psychological issues by pushing trades and missing the good ones. Also, % is what matters, not number of pips. Just 2c

on this one I don't agree. My target is 10 points DAX, which is very modest. By adjusting the trade size it will amount to 1%. When I make this I quit trading and enjoy doing something else. Which could also be watching the market, by the way. Usually it takes me less than 2 hours ... but of course not all days are profitable ... this way I want to make 10% each month, which will make me a millionaire in 6 years (... I keep on dreaming ...) so if this system promises to make me 8% each week I will be a millionaire soon ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Now I'm violating my own trading rules, but it's just because I'm so exited about this system. (I'm overtrading) They even seem to work in the 1 min chart.

My today's trade from EJ which was 4:1, clean and smooth, just shows how high probability setups looks like. Red line is s/r from H1. Also will be watching NU @ 88057.

The problem with UJ is, there was a strong support @ 101.68, just below the setup, but it's your call.

You might wan't to zoom out to look at the big picture, if you zoom in like that, it might look good, but it's false illusion. The first point doesn't count because it is from uptrend, you also have a support lower, it's always better when setups forms at the lowest point, so there's no s/r ahead.

You should have better waited for price to come down to the lowest point (1st arrow). You have to get over getting scared out of trades, this will eat you up, bad MM.

Markets recently all messed up, news driven, hard to find an environment for a positive expectancy. It's frustrating to sit a week without taking a single trade, but it happens.

This setup of EUR/AUD has good characteristics, strong overall trend down, clean and smooth price action, getting tight as it moves lower and clean space, support is only 19 pips lower. It's a pity that it formed during the fed speech, so no go.

For anyone who is finding good 5m setups a bit thin on the ground lately because of low ADR and volitility might find looking for 1m setups an interesting pastime, but be warned if you get into these it might be hard to go back to more profitable 5m setups.  
Here's a nice example here of a setup on A/u which was good for 10pips or 4% return.  
These setups occur in any time frame,its just a mater of finding the right t/f that suits you and your lifestyle, have fun and good luck .

hi pgd ..this doesnt look good...your point 1 is in the middle of a range of candles and moving down from a high point ..you want to be looking for price to be moving up in this case to form point 1 ... in the direction of the 1hr momentum ..heres a NU trade earlier which gained 20 pips ..study rifids charts until memorised ..cheers booker .

Hello everyone, sorry havnt been on the thread much lately as i have been very busy in our private trading room on Palringo which runs thru the Euro and NJ sessions.  
As everyone who is currently trading the markets ATM knows the daily ranges have been at historic lows which means trading systems are finding it a little harder to find decent trending markets in which to trade,August was a shocking month with few trading opportunities, but the good news is September is showing signs of increased volitility and trending in the markets,which is what this and most systems need to be profitable.  
We in the group have noticed, while waiting for 5m setups to appear that we were seeing many more 1m T/F setups that were'nt visible when on the 5m T/F, infact there were as much as 20 -40 setups per week, with around 40% going to 4RR , where as we where only seeing 3 or 4 good 5m setups.  
  
The rules for trading 1m setups are excactly the same as the 5m, YOU MUST ONLY TRADE IN TRENDING MARKETS, trading in sideways markets is throwing your money away,remember you are looking for moves of 20 pips or more to get your 4RR so its pointless trading on ranging pairs.  
  
The main difference in trading 1m as opposed to 5m is the speed of market, sometimes setups occur very quickly so you have to be on the ball as you need to scan multiple pairs, up to 8 or 9 if possible. I trade 9 of the lowest spread pairs which have a spread of less than 1 pip. If you have multiple monitors this makes the job of keeping an eye on the market much easier. When the market is trending you may find that setups are occuring all over the place, only take the really good quality ones.  
  
I think you will find trading 1m, very very profitable, if you do it right, and have discipline, IF THERE IS NO TREND DO NOT TRADE. READ the rules in the the thread multiple times if necessary ,learn what a quality setup looks like and where to find it, everything you need to know is in the thread, trading every little setup thats comes along will just give frustrating results, it may take many weeks to learn properly or it may only take you a week, but dont take shortcuts or the market will chew you up. Trade professionally, learn your money management and patience and you will be well rewarded  
  
I will post some 1m chart setups and you will see they are no different to 5m setups,you will just find many more of them. Trading is a numbers game so the more opportunities you have to enter the market the more trades you will win { as long as they are quality setups}.  
  
If you have been here before and know how the system works, you can start looking for 1m setups and have fun.  
If this is your first time here, go straight to Post No1 and start reading every single post and chart, take it seriously if you want to succeed, dont skip the details.  
I will drop in as much as possible but generally during the Euro and NJ sessions i am busy in the trading room.  
Good Luck  
RIFID

1m trading is not for everyone, if you are used to trading 15m or higher ,it may take you some time to get used to the speed of the chart, so take your time and dont rush into it with out acclimatising to it, dont be a gambler, be professional.

Look for a nice trending market in a higher time frame such as the 5m before looking for 1m setups. Remember NO TREND, NO TRADE.

Perhaps some exciting times await today with the scottish voting.

Here's a trade from earlier today, using the momentum from the sinking Aussie Dollar.

This indicator is from flotsom. And below is his description.  
  
This strength meter measures the overall strength of a currency on a "percentage" basis when compared to the other major currencies, and it measures this on a tick by tick basis rather than using Moving Averages as is the case with the CC indicators mentioned on this thread. For me, this makes this one more responsive and accurate for showing a currencies true strength "now".  
  
When I say it measures as a percent basis, I mean in terms of how much a currency gains or loses compared to its price in a particular pair. For instance if the NZDUSD pair moves 80 pips higher, the USD has lost (very approximately) 1%. Whereas if the GBPUSD also moves 80 pips higher, the USD has only lost (again VERY approximately) 0.5%. So even though they have both moved the same 80 pips, in relative terms of percentage gained/lost, there is a vast difference. So this indicator measures percentage gains/losses rather than pips, as I again feel this is a much more accurate way to measure true strength when comparing currencies against one another.  
  
There is a screen shot below to show how this should look and what each element is.  
  
The indicator settings are as follows:  
  
  
**Currencies:** EUR, USD, GBP, JPY, CHF, CAD, AUD, NZD - These are the currencies the indicator is measuring against one another. So in total the indicator will be looking at approximately 28 pairs as offered on most MT4 brokers.  
**CurrDisplay:** 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1 - these relate to the above 8 currencies. If they are set to "1", the indicator will display information about that currency. If it is set to "0", the indicator will not display that particular currency. So for example, if you weren't interested in seeing any information about the AUD and NZD, you would set this input to: 1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0 - You should note that even if a currency is turned "off" here (set to 0), the indicator will still use that currency in all its calculations for comparing relative strength, but simply won't display the information for that individual.  
**SymbolFixes:** This is for prefix and suffix used on some brokers and is empty by default. If your broker uses something like "mEURUSD" you enter "m". If your broker symbols are "EURUSDm" you enter ",m". If your broker symbols are "mEURUSDx" you enter "m,x".  
**ShowSignal:** This is where you enter the particular currency pairs you are interested in trading and getting suggestions for (you will see an explanation of this in the attached image). If you're not interested in any trade suggestions, you can leave this empty. By default I believe there are about 8 pairs listed here, but you can have as many or few as you desire.  
**TimeFrame:** Default is set to 0 which means the indicator will use the time frame of the chart it is attached to. But you can set this to any time frame you like by entering the minutes here (i.e. 60 for the 1 hour chart).  
**StrengthBase:** Default set to 60. This is used for the line graph and the left hand bar chart and means the point in the past from which to measure the currencies strength. So if set to 60, the meter will calculate the percentage gains or losses for a currency compared to where it was 60 periods ago.  
**RecentCHBase:** Default set to 10. This is exactly the same as the above input but is measuring over a shorter period. So if set to 10, the meter will calculate the percentage gains or losses for a currency compared to where it was 10 periods ago. My intention is to use this to determine if a currency is strong or weak in the same direction in the short term as it is in the long term.  
**ShowLineChart:** Set to true means the line chart will display. Set to false means the line chart will not be displayed.  
**ShowBarChart:** Set to true means the bar charts will display. Set to false means the bar charts will not be displayed.  
**UpdateOnTick:** Set to true as default and means the indicator will update and make fresh calculations on every tick, giving real time representation of strength.  
**AllowAlert:** Default false, but can set to true if you want a pop up alert to notify you when a currency pair trade suggestion is made.  
**AllowSound:** Default false, but can set to true if you want a audible sound alert to notify you when a currency pair trade suggestion is made.  
**MinAlertIntv:** default 30 means the alerts will not sound more than once if the same pair to trade suggestion is made more than once within 30 seconds. This is useful if due to the tick by tick nature of the updated calculations a pair [/b]suggestion may flicker on and off a few times before it stays on or off.  
**LineChartBars:** 200 as default is the number of bars you can scroll back on the line chart indicator. Setting this too high can mean the indicator can look very narrow to compensate for the odd time when currency strength diverge to extreme distances.  
**LegendOffsety:** meter position on the chart.  
**MeterPosition:** as above  
**Colours:** self explanatory for the individual currency display on the line chart. There is also a legend to show this on the actual indicator display.

![](/attachment/image/1537567?d=1414547991)

  
  
On our strategy, I suggest 1 hour for longer time frame and 30mins on shorter time frame.  
It means, if you are on 1M chart, set StrengthBase to 60 and RecentCHBase to 30.  
If you are on 5M chart, then set StrengthBase to 12 and RecentCHBase to 6.  
  
This indicator is not to be used independently. Only use this indicator when there is "setup".  
When "setup" line up, use this indicator meter to see if the pair you are entering is the strongest vs weakest currency. If it's not, you may want to consider entering with the strongest vs weakest.  
  
For example, if a long "setup" appear in EU, you may want to check if Euro is strongest currency and if USD is weakest. A glance on the strength meter will indicate so. If AUD is stronger than EU, then you may want to long AU, instead of EU.

No the method hasn't failed, I use something like it everyday on the 1 minute chart. Maybe because it has no indicators people don't like it, but in my opinion once you understand how price actually works trading is so much easier. It's also much more refreshing without focusing on indicators.  
  
Happy trading everyone...

We have actually moved to private group chat.  
  
If you want to find us, can download "Parlingo" then find a group called "forexgroup".

Lots of good quality setups lately, all earning 8% @ 2% risk, such as the one shown below.  
If your fed up with the ongoing frustration of going from one indicator system to another and never seaming to make any money, maybe its time to change your thinking.  
Trade the way the Pros do, price action on naked charts, with practice and study its the only thing that works longterm, just ask the members of our private trading group.  
Learning Price action opens up a whole new world of opportunities to those who are prepared to put the chart time in and study, study,study, there are no free rides in Forex as anyone who's been doing it for a while will know, but by learning P.A. you will find trading opportunities that will blow your mind , methods that everyone else is totally blind to, because there mind and eyes are focused on an indicator. Set yourself free and rid your chart of those profit robbing indicators that you have wasted months or even years trying to make them work.  
Good luck to you all.

Hi Rifid and others,  
  
thank you for excellent inspiration. I have one question. In post #1 is:  
\-------  
ENTRIES:  
Once you have found a suitable entry , set your Buy Stop at the top point plus your spread {max 1.5} plus .2 pip then . Your t/p is 5 pips above this.  
Example Top of point is 138.32 + .9 spread +.2 = entry price of 139.42.  
For sell we only ad .2 to point value.  
Stop loss is set at same time as Buy/Sell order.  
\-------  
This spread entry shift is only because you use chart showing Bid price. I think.  
If I use for BUY entry Ask price and for SELL entry Bid price, I use only entry shift 0.2 pip. Am I right?  
  
Happy New Year!

Hi Guys,  
will answer a private message I got publicly as it might be of interest to others. When trading on 1m TF , SL is still 5 pips, and TP can be 10 or 20 pips, up to your own preference.  
  
Yes Private trading group still trading daily on Palringo, but please it is only open to traders fully conversant with the method as it takes to much time to train while we are busy trading.

Hello rifid,  
  
First off, Happy New Year and Thank you for sharing your system.  
  
Clean way to look into triangle break out.  
  
I went thru first 50 pages of this thread, this weekend.  
  
For me 5 pip SL feels too tight and I never get the confidence to buy the right volume. So I look to keep the SL at 50% of the distance which the 'small void' had made.  
  
The tool is palringo right? how do i get the pc client for this? Or is it meant only for smart phones?  
  
Here is my first observation of a possible setup. Correct me, if it's wrong.  
  
Thanks  
  
TradeStar

You need to understand that there are no shortcuts in trading education and learning to master a highly successful method. Invest the time. Practise, practise, practise. Ultimately the fruits of success will be there. Don't look for the easy way out.

Hi All,  
  
I have read the PDF file and am about 1/4 through the thread. I am very interested in this method and would appreciate validation on the USD/JPY long entry below.  
  
Kind Regards

Hi Roper,  
  
This is an excellent entry on either 5m or1m TF, reason being if you look at 5m chart you will see that it has been in long term long trend prior to retracement.  
  
Price pattern has given a perfect change of trend by giving a higher high and a higher low and topped it off by a lovely P2P setup at 118620, giving strong indication that price will at least go back up to previous 5m high 118882. Well done. 

patience is bitter, but its fruit is sweet

Thanks Rifid,  
  
Would I be correct is assuming that the first point in GBP/JPY here is not valid due to previous swing point being broken making it a previous downtrend?

You have caught me on a very rare day , I don't come on this thread very often as I am busy in the Private trading room and I feel that every thing that one needs to trade this method successfully is all contained in the thread, it is actually a very simple method mechanically to learn, trouble is most traders are so ingrained trading with indicators, telling them what to do [ highly misguided unfortunately} that they find it hard to readjust to thinking for themselves, some just cant do it. As long as you are relying on someone or something else to make trading decisions for you you will never succeed longterm in trading.  
  
Unlike many threads on FF this method of trading has never changed in its basic makeup since its inception, apart from going from 5m to 1m TF being the most common thesedays and the option of 10 or 20 pip TP. The reason for virtually no change is because it WORKS and dosnt need to change.  
  
Everything you need to succeed in trading longterm is in this thread, if you don't get it 1st time keep reading it and it will soon become more and more clear to you, be professional in your approach and be very determined for success and it will come to you, perhaps not overnight, but in a few months or so miracles will happen.  
  
Anyway back to your question Roper, you are right , this is not a valid setup as the points are not on the same plane, a question that has been asked and answered many times in the thread . Keep studying, good luck to all.  
  
RIFID

Hi,  
  
this is my first post on the forum. Please forgive me in case I say something inappropriate.  
  
This strategy sounds interesting, based on the comments on this thread. Therefore, my question is: why not to code the strategy into an EA? The strategy is easy and mechanical enough.  
  
Could it be feasible or am I missing something?  
  
Thank you!

If you can give me code to detect this pattern, I will even pay you for it.

Hi,  
  
sorry, but I am a newbie here ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
I am a decent programmer and I am studying mql4 right now. As a newbie, I see no reason why mql4 shouldn't be powerful enough to detect such pattern. But maybe I don't know enough about mql4 right now.  
  
Do you mean that it is a difficult pattern to detect programmatically?  
  
In case I will do that, I will be happy to share!  
  
Thanks

Yeah, pattern recognition is not that easy.  
  
I mean of course it can be done, since we can detect patterns in photographs. And I do not see a problem in mql, since you have data access and you have math functions, so that is doable.  
  
I never had the time and motivation to do it, so if you are volunteering, that's great ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

GBP/USD potential setup. I will probably be asleep before this one moves but hopefully one of you guys will profit from it!

Hi  
I came across this thread while researching triangles  
  
As I have just found the thread and only read the PDF once can someone check this setup and verify? the longer trend is down as shown by the trendline and the points match up exactly

I don't think people lost interest, but moved to a skype group. Read the thread I think the link is in there some where.

Rifid,  
  
I have to admit that you're someone who has my respect, you start a thread and gain a following and under no circumstances you hint at or try and get a paid following. I like the price action behind the method you trade.  
  
All the best,

The setup is invalid Avail.   
  
Price drops below the low between the 2 pts, before it breaks. The red bar about 5 before that red horizontal line with the ?

Hi Aman,  
  
Appreciate the reply. Thank you.  
  
Do you still trade using this method as is?  
Are you still with the group in Palingro?

Hi FX654,  
  
I see what you mean, Thanks, I did see that but I entered thinking the flag was still holding.  
Will pay more attention to the next one.

Have been practicing a lot on M5 in forex tester but using M1 live to gain experience and screen time.  
  
This has been happening a lot, I would guess the problem is that the M1 is very fast and I need more experience to catch up.  
  
I should also be using entry orders after the void appears.  
  
Overall the trades are great but per the attached chart about 50% of time I'm late.  
For trades like this where the P2 hasn't exactly hit P1 or higher I use market orders, in this case the difference was less than a pip being 0.3 pips.  
  
If P2 hits the P1 high or slightly above I use the entry order.  
  
Do you guys always use entry orders?  
Would you enter trades like this one?
