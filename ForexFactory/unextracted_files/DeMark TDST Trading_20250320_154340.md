Hello Everyone,  
  
The reason I am starting this thread is because I thought it was about time we had a serious Demark trading thread. I have noticed several threads using the Demark method however to my surprise they have never taken off. The DeMark method offers opportunities on any timeframe or pair and can give risk as low as 12 pips for GBPUSD as was the case today on the 5 minute chart.  
  
Going on past experiences I have found that using DeMark TDST setups works best when you have a longer-term view. For example, let say there was a daily bullish thrust on GBPUSD, the following day you would look to buy on a failure of a TDST support levels formed on a lower timeframe. I will try to also post my longer-term views and when I am looking for certain situations to develop. Please feel free to do the same.  
  
Below is the rules on how I trade the DeMark Method, please just flip all of the below for a buy situation:  
  
  
  

**TDST Bounce Sell Conditions  
  
**

**Step One:**  
The formation of a 9 count downtrend exhaustion sequence and TDST resistance level  
**  
Step Two:**  
A retracement, touch and failure at the TDST resistance level*****  
**  
Step Three:**  
Upon the closure of TDST resistance touch candle the chart will display the recommended number of lots  
**  
Step Four:**  
Press ctrl + S accordingly to open the number of lots specified**  
**  
Step Five:**  
a)Initial target should be placed at the closest TDST support level  
b)If there is the formation of a 9 count downtrend exhaustion sequence the stoploss should be moved to the high of the 9th bar.  
  
*Please note, once the touch candle has been established and orders have been placed they should only be cancelled if we get a close above the high of the touch candles high. Trades can be cancelled by using the TDCOUNT cancel script  
  
**Please note, by pressing ctrl + S (you set the hotkey to whatever) the script will automatically calculate the entry and stoploss and open 0.1 lots per time and you will be shown how many lots you can risk on the right hand side of the chart. So you can just repeat until the desired number of lots have been placed  
  
  
I have attached the indicators, scripts and my template file along with a picture of the perfect set-up and an order cancelation situation. In the next post I will post some more scenarios to help people understand it a bit more.   
  
Please feel free to ask any questions, I am here to help.  
  
  
Cheers  
Foggytrader

Mr DeMark refers to TDST as T (Tom) D (DeMark) S (Setup) T (Trend). After a TD Buy setup has formed the high of the first bar in the sequence is the TDST and considered to be the market resistance level, it is where the momentum began to accelerate. The opposite applies after a TD sell setup has formed the low of the first bar in the sequence is the TDST support level.

For anyone wishing to try the indicator, here's a little more about it. When you load up the template, push ctrl i and click to edit the TD Count file. Click on "show data" true. You will then get the information shown in the picture below. The default is set to 1% of your account.

Foggytrader, I'm still getting around all the posted info, but I placed your template and indicators on the charts and this is what I see:  
  
First chart took a clear tarde according to rules right?  
  
[](http://img35.imageshack.us/i/tdsqtrade.gif/)<http://img35.imageshack.us/img35/8215/tdsqtrade.gif>   
  
  
  
Question on this randomly picked chart. Why did the indicator plot the lines and arrow on that bar? is that a valid set up?

Below I have attached the current situation ( in my opinion ) for GBPUSD and how you can utilise the DeMark method to go with the trend for low risk.  
  
Since removing the upper BAT resistance on the weekly chart back in the first week of August GBPUSD has been Bullish on the weekly timeframe. What I look for after that is for the market to retrace somewhat (perhaps 50%, but a minimum of 25%) and make some bearish thrust bars. When we get a close above the bearish thrusts high that is the trigger and I would look to buy that level and then buy any corrections there after. So how am I going to do that? Well, it is a weekly chart and I am a small trader so the risk is too high. This is where DeMark comes in. When we get these condition and approach these levels I will drop down a few timeframes and get in with a lower risk.  
  
Now, as you will see below, the daily resistance has also been broken recently and we have had a close back above the high of the large bearish thrust meaning this market is bullish. As I have illustrated in the pictures below, there is a possible setup there.  
  
I have also attached a setup from earlier today (4th pic). It didn't work out in terms of the longer-term plan but partial profits were booked at the closest TDST resistance level.

Hi, foggy.  
  
Congrats on a great start showcasing TDST. Your chart illustrations look very professional. Clean, clear, and well rendered.  
  
Will you be discussing DeMark's supply/demand lines?

Sorry, I forgot to explain. There is a history function in the indicator. The blue arrow can be moved to the bottom of any candle and the info i.e. risk entry etc will be shown on hte left hand side of the screen. Just press ctrl i and edit the TD Count file and set the history to false and the blue arrow will go.

Thanks Opie,  
  
So far I just stick to trading the failures of the TDST levels plus another way which I will explain later.  
  
I forgot to also mention that I put a number below each TDST line as I view number 1 sequences as the most significant.

I took this trade in USDCAD earlier today as I am already long USDCAD as the daily chart shows. Not looking great now but we will see. Nice 5 minute entry though.

Took this trade, it wasn't the greatest failure but the price didn't close below the TDST support level or the low of the touch candle so thought it was worth holding. Off to bed now, I will just leave this one, its only 25 pips risk. Perhaps a nice surprise in the morning.

I'm glad you are starting this thread I have become very interested in the Demark indicators since I started to use his trend lines with some very good success. It's my goal for the New Year to work on his Sequential system.  
  
How long did it take you to learn to use his system?   
  
What advice do you have for someone that does not use it now? where to start.

Hello SimpleGuy,  
  
How long did it take me to learn to use his system?   
  
It only really took a couple of months to master this particular area of DeMark. However, it took longer to realise when to take each signal. As I have mentioned in a previous post, I feel it is important to have an overall plan, a view on the longer-term path of a pair then use DeMark to build up positions in a certain direction. For sure, this particular method can be used for intraday, in and out trading but one can’t follow all pairs on a 5 minute chart everyday and expect to live past 50, it is just too much.  
  
Here is an example, back in August I had a view of EURGBP as you can see from the first picture. I was looking for it to break the upper resistance then I would look to go long after the minimum 25% retracement. As you can see from the second picture, this all materialised. Now the third picture shows a DeMark entry on the 5 minute chart which was close to the stoploss level for the longer-term trade as illustrated in the second picture.

The risk on the 5 minute chart in the example above was only 12 pips giving you the chance to have a good number of lots heading for your first target. You will only need a couple of these situations per year and you will make a good return. Unfortunately I was still caddying at this point so missed this particular opportunity.   
  
What advice do I have for someone that does not use it now? Where to start?  
  
Well, I would say firstly trading the way I have developed is a good place to start. If you are serious about DeMark I would advise buying Jason Pearls book “ _DeMark Indicators (Bloomberg Market Essentials: Technical Analysis)”._ You will learn a lot from this book as the DeMark method has numerous ways of trading. Basically, try this out on a demo first until you get used to the setups and the scripts. The risk is set at 1% which I think is perfect for a low risk entry method like DeMark (depending on the TF). Also, if you have any other questions please don’t hesitate to ask.  
  
Cheers

Below is the current daily chart of EURGBP. The lower BAT support was broken yesterday giving a short-term opportunity.

Although not part of my longer-term view I did mention a chance to go long if it was there. My post was actually after this setup occurred, interesting though all the same. Just to illustrate how it works.

If you read my profile you will see I caddie in the summer and trade in the winter. I am officially self employed, pay my taxes based on my caddying and trading so I guess you can say I am a full-time trader, it is part of my income. I am always active during the summer which I guess is why I started to look at larger timeframes for analysis as it doesn't always require you to be at the screen.  
I guess I am in the same boat as many people at FF, until your account reaches a comfortable level you need to have a “real job” (as everyone calls it) to pay the bills.

Hi Foggy  
  
Ive played in St Andrews - lovely course !!  
  
Quick question: what are the 2 long red lines (named:buy15 and sell 2 ) as shown on the attachment with the red arrows?  
  
How many times does a breach of the support/resistance line occurr ?  
  
Culd you please go over the longer term framework (the daily) to set the theme to concentrate on the 5 mins (I dont have the bat indicator either) -  
  
Thanks

Hey Foggy, starting to get the hang of it.   
  
Can you please check my trade and confirm my logic was right?  
  
Pervaz, did you take that trade? It seems we were looking at the same chart.

Good stuff Pervaz, yes it’s a great place to work but unfortunately it won't allow me to take early retirement.  
The lines you are seeing is the potential TDST lines forming. If you have a 9 count formation the line will stay there for 12 bars then it will change to the normal smaller line. If the count fails because the current bar will no longer close lower/higher than 4 bars before it the line will also disappear.  
  
  
The support/resistance levels can be breached many times in one day, just look at GJ over the past few days. This is why I would say you need to heighten the probability to take the right breach/failure. As I have said before I take a long-term view of a market then when everything lines up I will try to take the TDST bounces that concur. Other than my BAT idea I have also been trying out the idea of trading DeMark on a 5 minute chart the post a bullish or bearish thrust day. For example, if we get a bullish thrust on the daily chart we could look for opportunities buy off the TDST support levels the following day. Take it as an intraday profit strategy but you could let part of your trade run for a longer-term trade/profit.   
  
There are many ways in which to use the DeMark indicator which was why I wanted to get other people involved. To try things out and bounce ideas off each other.  
  
Hope this helps,  
  
Cheers

Why would you think they are a trial? I don't think there is an expiry on the indicators, if there is I will need to talk with my coder to take them off.   
  
Please by all means, play around with them and share your ideas.

This is in your code thats why i asked  
  
  
if (TimeCurrent() >= StrToTime("2009.12.31")) {  
Alert("Your trial version has been expired! Please contact trade4rex.cn to renew");  
return (0);

Ok, thanks for that. I will make contact and get it removed. Or is it something you can do yourself? I would appreciate that, I am not a coder so have no idea how these things work.

I have traded this DeMark method just over a year now. I would say most of my best trades last year came from 5 minute DeMark entries. However, I thought it was best to get a longer-term view and use it to build up positions as explained in earlier post.  
  
Hope you can take part, thanks.

Still adding to my USDCAD longs, took this one last night as it was only 13 pips risk. I have moved it to breakeven for my longer-term target at 1.1269 so hopefully it will hold, if not I continue to actively look for opportunities to go long and eventually if my long-term analysis is correct I should have several levels long.

Hi Hensch  
  
I didnt take the trade - i hadnt thought of using previous support/resistance  
  
Quick question is that you have an additional support level (Number 6) that i didnt have on my chart and yet the timings were pretty similar  
  
Any ideas ?

Hi Pervaz,  
  
Your entry is sound however my chart is of a USDCAD entry. Currently I have no long-term view on EURUSD unless it breaks the 1.4464 level or gives me a strong bullish or bearish daily candle then I may take an intraday trade. I can see from your chart there was a failure/reaction at the 5th TDST support level, so it was a valid entry.   
  
I do think the first TDST support level has the greatest meaning but as you can see from my entry on the USDCAD it was the 2nd in the sequence. You have to make the call, but basically if you see a good reaction and that is part of your overall view then you can take it.   
  
Nice trade, keep it up![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
Cheers

As you can see on the Daily chart, GBPCHF broke through the upper BAT resistance two days ago. Coincidently, this was on the same day EURGBP broke through the lower BAT support. As is the case with the EURGBP where I mentioned I would attempt small longs on good signals, I will now be attempting small shorts on GBPCHF with a view of reaching the 38.2% retracement of the move from 1.6116 to 1.7109 at around 1.6722.  
  
  
  
The 5 minute charts below show an attempt to take a short this morning and the subsequent cancelation as per the cancelation rules. I have also shown where I will make another attempt should we get a good enough failure.  
  
Cheers

Orders are now placed at a failure of the 3rd TDST resistance level which is also the 3rd TDST resistance level on the 15 minute chart.  
  
As I write the trade is triggered and the 15 minute bar has closed and looks quite bearish so we will see how it goes.

I posted my chart right after you did and the first thing that caught my attention was that you didn't have that level, so no idea why.  
  
If I understood correctly, using previous support/resistance is explained in the first posts.  
  
However I wanted to have Foggy's OK on it. Just to be sure.

Hello SpecialOne,  
  
The signal you spotted is a good one as I explain in the picture below. However, as I also explain in the next two pictures, personally this is a trade I wouldn't take. Although that doesn't mean it won't work it.

Posted below is my current take on the daily situation for GBPJPY. Since September this market has been bearish following the breach of the lower BAT support level at 144.31. Since then I have been actively looking for opportunities to go short (in a very difficult market recently). The best chance was when the final bullish thrust on the 22 of October had its low removed to a close by the big outside/bearish thrust bar, which indecently I missed ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1). I can't be here all the time. Nevertheless, I have been looking for more chances and managed to add one so far which will target the 125 area.

However, to contradict myself the weekly chart tells another story. Since breaching the upper BAT resistance at 162 back in June it has been bullish. There was one opportunity to go long following a close above a bearish thrust’s high which failed and since then we have not had a close above a bearish thrust which is the signal to start to look for longs. Now, until we either get a close above the last bearish thrusts high of 150.36 at which time we look for long opportunities or we get a breach of the lower BAT at 132 there is no clear direction on the weekly.

Point is you have to have a longer-term game. Even if these to contradict each other it is important to understand there are always two possible scenarios eventually.  
  
  
Hope this helps, nicely spotted setup

Hello Hensch,  
  
Yes, if you read carefully it is the TDST (support/resistance) levels that we look for a reaction/rejection. When we get that **_and if it agree's with your longer-term view_** , we take the trade.  
  
Shown below is a possible outcome in EURGBP, which agrees with my longer-term (more medium-term) strategy.

Hope this helps,  
  
BTW, when I say I will attempt small longs I don't use the full 1% risk I will only open one or two lots. I will save my full risk for the more higher probability larger reward set-ups.

foggy,  
So according this chart we should buy after show got 9 counts down now and the price for number 9 just touch but not close below the number 2 TDST support level. So is trigger for ---> Buy.  
  
But now the chart show it break but not sure will close or not.  
  
Let say:-  
  
(a)if it close below the number 2 TDST support level. So we need to wait   
it retrace to RED 1 or not? If retrace not reach there.So is trigger-->   
SELL?  
  
(b)if it close above the number 2 TDST support level. So it trigger-->BUY?  
  
By the way, is 1H TF is ok for GY ?  
  
please advise thanks. Going to understand already .

Hello SpecialOne,  
  
Yes it was a buy setup, you are correct. Following the rules this trade would have been triggered but if it has not been then it would be cancelled now as we got a close below the low of the candle which touched the TDST support level.  
  
(a) if it closes below the TDST support level or above a TDST resistance level we just leave it and look for the next opportunity.  
  
(b) No that is not the rule. We are looking for the price to react at the TDST levels, nothing else. Once it has been hit the price will either react or go through it either way once it has been touched it is left and not used again to make a trading decision.  
  
Personally I would say the 1 hour timeframe has to large a risk factor. I use this to get with little risk which is why I use the 5 minute chart the majority of the time. It is your own decision, you will get signals on any timeframe any pair so you have to decide.  
  
Hope this helps,  
  
Cheers

Posting this one as it is a good illustration of the perfect set-up. These setups happen every week at some point or another, the trick is obviously picking them. However, I believe that when the market knows where it wants to go, these setups will occur more often during the trend. Hopefully these will now hold for my longer-term target.

Yes just make your own mind up over the TP. It can be the opposite TDST line as is mentioned in my earlier training posts or it can be long-term as I am aiming for.

Just thought I would post in advance my thoughts on GBPJPY at the moment. I will be looking to sell around the 148.21 level should we get a nice failure there. This is also supported by the fact that the 60 day SMA is also around there currently at 148.17. If we get a close below there tonight then the losses may become accelerated.  
  
So for anyone who is interested, place a wee alert on your MT4 platform at GBPJPY bid > 148.20 and go relax and have some dinner ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Slight failure at the mentioned level, it is 46 pips risk and orders are placed to sell at 147.97.

Very nice Foggy. I've always had an interest in DeMark but never really grasped it until you broke it down clearly. Another tool for the tool box.

Sorry special one there is no entry on the 1 hour, as I mentioned earlier there was an entry to buy at the top of the 09:00am (10:00am GMT) bar which was triggered and the stoploss would have been 147.55 and it would be stopped now. Go back and read through the step by step guide and see if you can learn more.  
  
Good work though, keep trying and soon you will get it ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Thanks deepsouth,  
  
Yes, DeMark is a great tool and as I have explained if you choose the right time to get in you can soon build up a number of position.

After a promising start to this one the stop has been hit. You can't win em all I guess. We might still get a close below the 148.17 level and if we do selling will be on the cards again tomorrow.

Is touch and price close above the 1st resistant level. Now going to test the upper 1st resistant level. Possible a sell set up may approached.

As you can see from the picture, it was the correct TDST resistance level to sell from although it should been when it was first breached which was at 01:35 bar (00:35 GMT). This was in fact the perfect set-up, it touched the resistsance level and failed. Add to that it was also right around the level of 148.17 that I said was an important level which incidently was taken to a close last night so we will see if this accelerates the losses today.

Just posting this one out of interest here as I have no real view on GBPUSD where it is right now. As you can see from the picture, I just took a snapshot of past 12 hours or so worth of 5 minute bars. The picture shows two perfect rejections and four no trade situations as they closed over the resistance/support TDST lines on initial touch. Thought it was a good example for people to see when to leave a trade and when to take a trade.  
  
Hope this helps,

Just in case my breakdown training examples confuse people I just thought I should clarify something. You don't need to wait for the 9th candle to touch support/resistance. I mean if you get a 9th candle that touches a resistance/support level and fails then yes I would say it is a very high probability situation but it is not an essential part of the method. It can be any candle that touches and fails at the TDST levels.

Interestingly, as I wrote the last post I spotted this on GBPJPY. As you can see from the picture it is the 8th bar of a bearish exhaustion sequence that hits the TDST support level, which makes it quite a high probability entry although I am not looking to go long at the moment.

However, I don't know if anyone here has been reading the Scooby robot thread where they claim the BOJ intervenes on a daily basis and they recommend looking for buying opportunities from 06:30am - 09:00am GMT and selling opportunities from 22:30pm - 00:30am GMT. I have attached the article about the BOJ if anyone is interested.  
  
Anyway, if we look at GBPJPY last night, there was a sell opportunity at 00:35 GMT and then we got our buying opportunity this morning at 06:45. Could perhaps be something to watch out for to take some short-term profits each day should the opportunity present itself.

Not much going on today, just posting open positions built up this week. GBPCHF might get to target today other than that I would hope to see my USDCAD (long) and GBPJPY (Short) positions open for some time unless things really accelerate.

Could be your internet browser, someone on another forum had that problem but they were using google chrome, just a suggestion. If that ain't the problem then I can't help you.

GBPUSD has now arrived at a buying level on the weekly chart. Although this contradicts the overall pound outlook according to the daily timeframes on the likes of GBPJPY, GBPCHF and EURGBP it can't be ignored.  
  
As you can see from the chart below since the high (1.6466) of the final bearish thrust (20/09/09) was taken to a close I have been waiting for this level to be retested. So I will look for 5 minute DeMark entries to go long from here, most likely at the start of next week now.

It is not possible to open a .ex4 file.  
  
You can only edit an .mq4 file.  
  
A .ex4 file is a _compiled_ version of the .mq4 file (for those who know about programming).

Dear Foggytrader,  
  
First thing is i want to congratulate you for your superb thread.  
I have been applying TDST from 3 years on intraday for Indian Stocks, I know the power of TDST if used properly.  
  
But i am very eager to learn it's application in forex. Hope to learn a lot from you and also share my experiences with you.  
What i suggest if we could apply PA's best like PIN BARS and BUOB or BEOB for great results since we need emotion in motion ( sounds like phillip Nel LOL !)  
  
Cheers  
Winston

**AUDUSD**  

  
  

The Aussie Dollar has been bullish on the daily chart since breaching the upper BAT resistance level of 0.6843 on the 19th of March this year. Since this breach we have seen a rally of some 2500 points and surpassed the 2nd Fibonacci target of 0.8447 by 958 points. On the weekly chart I have been bullish since May this year following the upper breach of the 0.7990 resistance and we came 248 points short of the first Fibonacci target of 0.9653.

  

I had been looking for this pair to get up to the 0.9653 to 0.9790 on the weekly chart to attempt some shorts. However, with Morgan Stanley’s latest research showing the Aussie Dollar to be 40% over valued against the US Dollar and the formation of a bearish outside bar on the weekly chart I believe this pair offers a good opportunity to attempt some shorts. Therefore my strategy for this week is to look for opportunities to go short until we breach the lower BAT support at 0.8965 at which point my strategy will change.

**EURGBP**  
  
  
Earlier last week EURGBP broke through the lower BAT support level of 0.8866 turn it bearish on the daily chart while it remains bullish on the weekly chart until the 0.8208 level is hit. Following the breach I recommended taking some small longs however as we have now passed the 25% retracement level I will now sit on the sidelines until we either get a close below the low of a bullish thrust (currently that is 0.8948) or we take out the upper BAT resistance level at 0.9155.

EURUSD  
  

Since breaching the upper BAT resistance level of 1.3452 back in March of this year EURUSD has been in control of the bulls. The bullish outlook was also supported and confirmed following the removal of the weekly BAT resistance in MAY. Currently until we test either the daily TDST level of 1.4578 or the daily BAT support level of 1.4464 I will remain on sidelines for this pair.

**GBPCHF**  
  
  
Since removing the BAT resistance level of 1.7096 last week the bulls have regained control here on the daily chart. However, unless the bulls can remove the 1.8089 weekly BAT resistance level, the bears will remain in overall control here. Following the removal of the daily level this week I took some short positions targeting the 61.8% retracement level at 1.6730. Should we hit this level I will stay on the sidelines until we get a close above the last bearish thrusts high (Fridays high 1.6893) or we remove the lower BAT support level currently at 1.6156.

**GBPJPY**  
  
  
Since breaching the upper BAT resistance of 162 on the weekly chart the bulls have taken control of GBPJPY. However, so far they have failed to convince me and with the removal of the daily lower BAT support level of 144.31 the bears are fighting back. Currently, I am short at 149.57 looking for the first daily Fibonacci target of 125.33. I will continue to look for opportunities to go short unless we have a weekly close above the 150.36, or we go beyond the trend breakout point at 139.69. I would look to the 147 to 148 area to look for 5 minute DeMark short entries.

**GBPUSD**  
  
  
Currently, GBPUSD is under control of the bulls and below the trend breakout points on both the daily and weekly timeframes. Should this scenario play out the pair remains in a good buying zone and during Fridays session tested the high of the last bearish thrust at 1.6466. According to Morgan Stanley GBPUSD is around fair value against the USD while many of its G10 peers are way beyond fair value. For these reasons I will be looking for opportunities on the 5 minute DeMark chart to build long positions with an initial target of 1.7298. This strategy will remain intact until the 1.6084 level is removed on the daily chart or we produce any more bearish thrusts on the weekly chart.

**USDCAD**  
  
  
Since breaching the upper BAT resistance level of 1.0813 on the 29th of October USDCAD has become bullish on the daily chart. Following this development I waited for the retracement and initiated long-term longs following the close above the last bearish thrusts high. As the bears are in full control on the weekly chart I would rather stay on the sidelines this week until we make a higher high on the daily chart above the 1.0780 or buy into weakness around the last bullish thrusts low currently 1.0614.

GBPCHF  
  
GBPCHF met my target of 1.6730 and closed out my position overnight. I will now remain on the sidelines until we either get a close above a bearish thrusts high or we take out the lower BAT support currently situated at 1.6282. Currently I would fear the latter playing out as it was a fairly bearish weekly close and the weekly bat has started the week moving down for the first time in 8 weeks. Therefore although the daily breach of the upper BAT is bullish the risk of this pair heading down is too high to take longs unless we get a clear signal that the bulls have entered this market.

I had mentioned in my weekly outlook last night that I would be looking to go long GBPUSD. The chart below shows three occasions where we have had a close below the TDST support cancelling out the signal. Although they all turn out heading in the direction I am looking for, more often than not when you get a close below the TDST support level the price will head down and vice versa for a TDST resistance.

The only time we take a sell is when we get a touch/failure of a TDST **_Reistance_** or **_Support_** level. When we get a close below the TDST support level on the initial touch bar the setup is void. We **_MUST_** see some sort of reaction at the TDST levels then we must not get a close beyond that candles opposite extreme.   
  
For example, if we get a reaction at a support level but we then get a close below that candles low the setup is void. If we get a close below the TDST support level the setup is also void. Vice versa for a TDST resistance level.  
  
Hope this helps,

USDCAD  
  
I am posting the below picture to illustrate how the DeMark system can be used very well on any timeframe. The picture shows the recent 4 hour activity on the USDCAD. As we can see we got a nice reaction/failure candle at 2009.11.01. The interesting thing about this level is the fact that the daily BAT resistance level had just been broken so looking for entries short would be the idea. Also, more recently we had a failure at another 4 hour TDST resistance level and although it doesn't play along with my longer-term strategy, so far this is also a good looking failure. Just remember though, the higher the timeframe the higher the risk.

Well there is still room to the 148.02 (60 day SMA) and the number 1 TDST resistance level at 148.18 so we may have to wait for a retest of this area before we get a successful entry.

I use two MA's for GBPJPY. I apply a 60 day SMA (60 period to the close on a daily chart) and a 55 week EMA (55 period exponential to a close on a weekly chart). The 60 day SMA has often been the trigger for large movement in GBPJPY on the daily chart and you will see for yourself how significant the 55 EMA is on the weekly chart as far back as your data will go.  
  
Hope this helps,

Thanks FXSnipe,  
  
Hopefully I can help others learn the power of DeMark. Although today is not the best advertisment with two stops out of two so far, but that is trading.  
  
Any input is more than welcome,

From what I can see you are on a 1 hour chart and your entry is the bar after a nine count is complete. When a nine count occurs the market is said to be exhausted in that direction and it is expected to retrace somewhat. Therefore, the entry you have posted is wrong. We only take a trade that shows some sort of reaction when it touches a TDST support/resistance levels. I was looking for the price to come down to test the 1.6529 level on the 5 minute chart. So although the price continued higher after the completion of the nine count sequence on your chart you will find this to be an unusual occurrence. Just take signals that show the price bouncing off a TDST line then closing without going through said line.

Currently I am looking to build up shorts for a 125.33 target taken from the daily chart. If you look at my daily analysis you will see my targets. If I can build up several positions for each setup on the daily chart the reward will be great. I do sometimes have shorter-term targets and I will post them at the time. However, if anyone else has any other strategies I am happy to listen. I am currently checking whether it would be a good idea to risk 2% per trade using half to get back 2% and the other half to get 5%. Initial results show this to be a good method as the risk is so small that the targets are within reason to consistently bring in a good rate of return.

Thought I would post something I mentioned in my last post to explain a little more. The first picture is of a nice setup in AUDUSD tonight, there was a nice bounce at the TDST support giving a nice trade with only 11 pips risk.

The second picture shows how I split the 2% risk into two units and use the first unit to bank 2% and the second unit to bank 5%. With the risk being so small with the DeMark entries on the 5 minute chart we only require 22 pips to bank 2% and 55 pips to bank the full 5% meaning that if we get a move of just 55 pips, we bank 7% of our account. Obviously the battle is choosing the best entries to take but even a 25% success ratio will only leave you at -1% for the day/week. I for one am sure I can get a better than 25% success ratio per day/week.

Hi Tazzam,  
  
I didn't take the AUDUSD trade in my last post, I just used it as an entry example to explain how I am looking into changing my money management approach to also book some shorter-term profits.  
  
Generally I try to trade with the trend which is why I use daily and weekly charts to help me decide. For the last year or so I have used this method to build up long-term positions and I am currently looking into a way of making it a more short-term strategy. I mentioned on Sunday I would be looking to sell GBPJPY around the 147/48 level, we had two attempts yesterday and the second one worked out with only 20 pips risk, if you can pick which way you want to go, the signals will come if you are patient.  
Cheers

AUDUSD  
  
The daily picture is still the same for me, as is often the case after a large sell-off we get a retracement on the Monday but we have now lost over 100 points from the highs of yesterday and I am happy to look for an opportunity to short this market. I am looking to sell a bounce/failure of the 0.9222 level as illustrated in the 5 minute chart. This strategy will remain in place unless we make another bearish exhaustion sequence or we close above this level on initial touch.

Hi Winston,  
  
As I mentioned earlier I am building up positions for longer-term targets. The stop here is only 20 pips I would guess that should we make a move to that level again it will challenge my stop. I will book partial profits at the 145.77 level and leave the remainder of the position open targeting 125.33.  
  
My trades are all about getting in with low risk for a long term target when I think we are in a preferred area for buying or selling based on my daily/weekly analysis. Can be a bit long winded and gives you many ups and downs but like I have said before, if you can build up several positions with low risk obviously the size of your position is greater than if you just risked 1% or 2% on a daily chart, you will get a good reward in the end. You just have to be patient.  
However, as I have mentioned I believe there is great potential in adopting my risk 2% target 7%. As the risk is so low you don't need many pips to bank your 7%. I am still looking into this however.  
  
  
Cheers

The bulls and bears are fighting this one out with no clear winner yet. The price is right between the lower BAT supprt which was broken and the upper BAT support situated at 0.9155. With the lower support broken I would lean more towards the bearish scenario but until we get a close below a bullish thrusts low (currently 0.8948) or the bulls take out the upper BAT resistance at 0.9155 I will remain on the sidelines.

Nothing has changed here as far as I'm concerned. Until we test the daily TDST support at 130.63 or breach the lower BAT support at 129.42 I will remain on the sidelines. As I said before since the upper BAT resistance level of 129.41 was broken the bulls have really failed to follow through here and I fear if the bears can take out the lower BAT support we could make a move to the lower 120's.

This pair remains in control of the bulls on both the daily and weekly timeframes but at current levels is lacking follow through. I would need to see a move to the 2nd daily fibonacci target of 1.5812 or a breach of the lower BAT support at 1.4464 before I become involved here.

GBPCHF  
  
Since breaching the daily BAT resistance level last week the bulls have regained a share of this market. However, with the bears remaining in full control of the weekly timeframe unless the 1.7855 level is breached their glory may well be short lived. I would need to see a close back above the last bearish thrusts high (1.6893) to convince me that the bulls are serious or a breach of the lower daily BAT support of 1.6439 to reassert the bear position and all but kill off the bulls for an eventual move to the 1.5 region.

GBPJPY  
  
  
In my opinion, since breaching the upper BAT resistance at 162 on the weekly chart the bulls have really failed to assert themselves. Breaching the lower daily BAT support at 144.31 was a big blow to the bulls and was the first signal that the bears were coming out of hibernation for another move lower. Unless the bulls can remove the 150.36 level to a weekly close or breach the upper BAT daily resistance at 154.28 I fear we could see a move to the 125.33 and possibly the 101.83 level into next year. Taking this into consideration I will continue to look for selling opportunities unless the above levels are taken by the bulls.

GBPUSD  
  
In a similar fashion to EURUSD this market is under control of the bulls on both the daily and weekly timeframe. However, unlike the EURUSD we are in the early stages of a bull break of each BAT. So far the bulls haven't really convinced me here and as all my other GBP analysis is leaning towards a bearish scenario I am reluctant to go long here. However, the current patterning shouldn't be ignored. Therefore I will be looking for opportunities to go long unless we close below the 60 day SMA (1.6371) or the 55 week EMA (1.6329) at which point I will reassess my strategy.

USDCAD  
  
Although under control of the bears on the weekly chart the bulls have taken out the upper daily BAT resistance and are so far making some decent progress. Unfortunately two of my long positions have been removed this week although I still have one remaining and I will be looking to add to this position. This strategy will hold unless the bears can remove the last bearish thrusts high at 1.0503 to a close or the lower daily BAT support at 1.0258.

GBPJPY  
  
Just gone short at 146.51 on a failure of the 146.67 TDST resistance level. The actual 9 count wasn't really the best although when GBPJPY starts to move I have seen entries like this work out before, if not we can still look to go short again on a failure of the 146.93 level.

That is the tick value, always important to know when you are working out your risk. I have attached it below, just add to your experts/indicators folder and apply to any chart.

Such stop outs should be expected from time to time but key is to hold on to winning positions to come out a winner at the end. to me this is a very good system as the stop loss levels are very tiny in comparison to the expected payoff.

I am using a quick stop on this one as we have hit the closest TDST support level and made another TDST resistance level now at 146.98 which offers a fresh opportunity to add short positions. Considering these developments It may range around for a bit now.

Well it just depends really, last year saw a massive shakeup in the position of money around the world and brought about moves that had never been seen before and may not be seen again. Like so many others I would presume, there was really an embarrassment of riches trading forex last year. You would take a signal with a long-term target and it was hit before you got up in the morning. I would say I can remember having four short positions in GBPJPY at one point which met my target in a couple of days and in the grand scheme of things my target looked small after the move. However, I don’t think we will be so lucky this year, I think patience will be the name of the game but I do think I can build up several positions on several pairs and get the rewards. Although as I say things may not be so fast this year so I am looking into other ways of taking shorter-term profits and I will keep everyone posted and if anyone else has any other ideas I would welcome some input.

GBPJPY  
  
Here we go again folk’s, there is a plethora of TDST counts for this pair today which tells me there is a bit of a battle going on between the bulls and the bears. Another failure at a TDST resistance level so the setup can't be ignored, let’s hope the market is telling us something and with only 22 pips risk it is a reasonable risk/reward situation where GBPJPY is concerned. Tight stops are still the name of the game here though and I will monitor this one carefully.

Please find below the profit and loss since I started the thread. I have blacked out certain aspects for privacy but you can still check all my entries to see if there is any better way to mange the trades.

**Money Management Experiment**  
  
  
As I have mentioned in previous posts today, I am looking into changing my MM approach to trading the TDST DeMark method. I have been looking into a strategy based on using a certain percentage of your account to determine targets as opposed to having to choose entries based on technical analysis. The rules are as follows:  
  

Entry is using the DeMark 5 Minute  

Risk 2%  
Reward 1st unit 2%  
Reward 2nd unit 5%  
Move to breakeven once 1st unit is closed  
  
I have looked back through all my entries since I began the thread and got some promising results. I have attached the excel sheet for everyone’s perusal. Please go through each entry, and check my calculations to make sure I am not missing something. The success of this obviously depends on choosing the direction to take on each pair but so far I seem to have done an ok job at that, but perhaps using my long-term targets are wrong. You can check through the thread and see where I said only to look for certain directions on each pair and they will all match. I would appreciate anyone’s input here as I think it shows promiss.  
  
Cheers

Well, its a long process and the open p/l will change so its not impressive as of yet, but it should be in due course.

GBPJPY  
  
As I am looking to for selling opportunities on this pair I have identified TDST resistance levels on the 5 minute at 147.85 and the 15 minute at 147.88 level while the 60 day SMA is also located at 147.87. With this area showing up on several timeframes I see a failure here as an ideal opportunity to take a short position.

GBPJPY  
  
We came some 20 pips short of the prefered selling level before the bears pilled in here. The first chart below show GBPJPY daily and it illustrates that the bears are defending the 60 day SMA. However, the weakness is coming through from USDJPY which it should be noted has just gone through daily TDST support at 88.34 and is on the 9th bar of a bearish exhaustion sequence as shown in the second chart below.   
  
So should USDJPY close back above the 88.34 TDST support tonight I will be attempting small longs in that pair. While with GBP looking bullish against the CHF (daily), EUR (daily) USD (daily & weekly) and JPY (weekly) we may not get much follow through from here.

Nice entries Fxtaiko,  
  
Personally I don't take TD buy and sell setups, but it is another way to use the DeMark indicator. I guess based on my analysis I could also take TD setups but I am sure there are many false signals. Once price makes a TD setup the retracement tends to be brief then it heads back in that direction which is why I then trade the bounce from that level as it gives us confirmation.  
  
By all means, check back and post you findings, thanks, good trading![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
Perhaps with the entries you took the exit partial profit level should be the TDST support levels on both charts.  
  
Cheers

USDCAD  
  
Looking at the daily chart of USDCAD tell me that the bulls have not lost their battle yet. I am still happy to look for long positions at present levels to add to my lonely one position left. I would only change my view once the bullish thrust/outside bar of 12/11/09 has its low removed at which point I will stay on the sidelines until the lower TDST support at 1.0263 and the lower daily BAT support of 1.0175 levels are challenged.

I wrote the indicator you are talking about (well, modified it from another indicator to tell the whole truth :-).  
  
I remember we had that problem previously, but right now at least, cannot remember why/how it happens to chew up the CPU.  
  
It's strange because I just downloaded it from this thread and it works fine.  
  
I'll keep you updated if I find the problem.  
  
  
Magnus  
  
  
EDIT: I presume you are talking about the _TDCount_ indicator...

Hello Gutek,  
  
Not really sure how it is slowing down your computer, I have the 4 pairs I am actively trading on the same workspace and my CPU is fine. You could try to change the numberbars to 500 I have it set to 1000 but still, if you have it set really high like 100,000 it might slow you down a little.  
  
Hope you can get it sorted,  
  
Cheers

AUDUSD  
  
We had a good failure candle at the previously mentioned TDST resistance level of 0.9295. However, price quickly closed back above the failure candles high without triggering the orders so they are now cancelled and I will await another opportunity.

USDCAD  
  
I posted earlier that I was looking to buy the USDCAD at the 5 minute TDST support level of 1.0456. However, we have had a touch and closed below this level so the setup is now void.

GBPUSD  
  
Well, I have been looking for opportunities to go long on GBPUSD since last Friday and this was the closest we have come thus far. Price came within 2 pips of my prefered buying level of 1.6640.

foggytrader, this is really a powerful strategy, I have already made over 300 pips on GBPJPY and I will test this forwrd on this pair only going forward. But key to this strategy is alwasy trade in the direction of the long term trend and take small losses if they do happen and hold on to winners. if 144.97 fails I will short it again . I have one lot short at the momnet profit level 142. Thanks once again fro sharing this

GBPJPY  
  
As I mentioned last week, the close below the 60 day SMA has often been the trigger to a big move in this pair and true to form the move has accelerated this week. I am still looking to add to my two short positions however, I would need to see a good failure at a TDST resistance level as we are nearing the daily TDST support level of 141.51 at which point I plan to book partial profits. Additionally we are on the 7th bar of a TD buy setup on the dailies and should this complete and we get a bounce from the TDST support level I will look to add small longs.

Yes, it is a good way to trade and as you say, the key thing is to know what is going on in the bigger picture. Well done, nice to hear someone getting something out of this.

USDCAD  
  
With the bullish outside thrust bars low still holding at 1.0416 I am still happy to look for opportunities to go long targeting 1.1251 area. This strategy will hold unless the low of 1.0416 is taken out. At which point I will wait until we test the TDST support level of 1.0263 where I look to add small longs on a bounce.

EURJPY  
  
As shown in the daily chart below, EURJPY has tested the TDST daily support level at 130.66 this morning. We have so far seen a bit of a reaction from there and built up a TD sell setup on the 5 minute producing a TDST support level at 130.65 which is one pip from the aforementioned TDST daily support level. Taking this into consideration I am comfortable trying small longs should we drop back down and test this level on the 5 minute chart and show a clear bounce.

I don't worry about news, you shouldn’t let it influence your trading decisions. The majority of the time you can make rash decisions just after or before a news release only to find that an hour or two or maybe a day or two later the price moves in your original direction. I just set my alerts and leave the screen checking back every 15 minutes or so to see if there are any new TDST levels that are of interest to me.  
  
Personally, I have some slabs that need laying in the garden so I'm off to get on with that. Sound's like the wrong time year to do that in Scotland I know as it is gale force winds and very cold but if I don't get it finished soon the dog will be in a mud bath all winter...

Personally, I am taking partial profits at the 141.60 level on GBPJPY and hold the rest for a move lower over the next few months. As you will know I am still bullish on the GBPUSD on both weekly and daily so I would likely trail that one on the daily high of bearish thrusts.   
  
Nice trades!

EURJPY  
  
EURJPY closed below the 160.65 TDST support level mentioned a few minutes ago so the setup is now void. I will wait to see if any further TDST support levels show up today and look for a bounce from these levels to initiate small longs.

The majority of the time you can make rash decisions just after or before a news release only to find that an hour or two or maybe a day or two later the price moves in your original direction. I just set my alerts and leave the screen checking back every 15 minutes or so to see if there are any new TDST levels that are of interest to me.

It can be a bit tricky as surprise news can really shake one out of a good position or losing the bulk of it back. But yes I agree with what you are saying foggytrader that one should trade price and not news

Yes, well I think it is important to remember that markets are continuously changing so you have been prepared for both scenarios. My GBPJPY trades are finished, I am at breakeven, the targets are set and I forget about them, it is up to the market now. If I get a reason to go long but still in the short I will take it, then I am covering both outcomes. Just remember, until it is showing up in your balance it is not your money, tough to do but must be accepted.

Thats the right mindset as thinking what to do in the middle of a trade is a sure way to a poor house

Hello Vladv,  
  
The green and red lines on my daily and weekly charts are the BAT indicator. You can find out about it on this thread:  
  
[http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...=95328&page=21](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=95328&page=21)  
  
I use it for my long-term analysis, the thing I like about this indicator is the fact that there is no lag involved. Just like the DeMark method, the BAT is as it is, once a bar closes there is no re-painting later and it is what it is. You need to change the settings for different pairs but I have had the same settings on my pairs for over a year now and each break has been spot on. Basically, if we get a upper break this tells me that the bulls are in control and viceversa for a break of the lower level. After that it is up to you to choose what to do. Here are my rules:  
  
Upper break: Small shorts to 61.8% retracement level, then when we close above a bearish thrusts high I look for longs.  
  
Lower break: Small longs to the 61.8% retracement level, then when we close below the low of a bullish thrust I look for shorts.  
  
When I say I look for a certain direction, obviously thats when I turn to the 5 minute chart and look for DeMark entries in my chosen direction.  
  
Hope this helps,  
  
Cheers

AUDUSD  
  
Although the BAT still has the bulls in control here on both the daily and weekly timeframe I suggested looking for selling opportunities at the start of the week following the bearish outside bar formed last week as illustrated in the chart below. I also highlighted the fact that Morgan Stanleys latest currency research report states that the Aussie Dollar is currently 40% over valued versus the USD. With the latest developments in the markets seeing the commodity currencies taking a hit I will hold my view of looking for opportunities to sell this market.

EURGBP  
  
Although the bulls are still in control on the weekly chart, the bears have taken a significant step to recapturing this market following the breach of the lower daily BAT support level of 0.8866. Following this development we have seen a quick move higher making five bullish thrusts on route to the 50% retracement level. At this point I see the speed of the recovery from the lower BAT level and the failure today at the 50% retracement level as a worrying development for the bulls. I now see a close below today’s bullish thrusts low at 0.9037 as a trigger for the bears to come back in and take us down to the trend breakout point at 0.8833 initially. Therefore I will remain on the sidelines until this scenario plays out. This strategy will hold unless we make another bullish thrust at which point a close below its low will be the new trigger point or we get all the way up to the upper daily BAT resistance level of 0.9289.

Is there any chance to make this indicator (TD combo) do not delete all the vertical, horizontal lines, channels etc. I have on chart after restarting MT4? Sorry, that both my posts here are about fixing indicator, but belive me putting the same lines/channels on 6 charts few times a day is very annoying. Have a nice trading guys!

foggytrader, GBPJPY, blew past the target level before reversing, the greedy part of me says: "bollocks I should have stayed all nuight and would have made more pips". Easy to say that in hindsight. Looking forward to seeing your analysis going forward on this pair. Not good news from Dubai

GBPJPY  
  
Since breaching the lower daily BAT support at 144.31 the bears took control of this pair on the daily chart. With bulls having control on the weekly chart it was a question of who was going to come out on top and I believe that has almost been decided with events this week. This has however come as no surprise with the bulls unable to remove the TDST resistance at 152.78 then failing to hold the 60 day SMA. Overnight the bears ran riot removing the TDST support level of 141.53 with ease while also removing the trend breakout point at 139.69. I see these developments as confirmation that the bears have taken full control of this market and have the weekly lower BAT support of 131.96 in their sights. Should this be broken we open up a move to sub-100 levels into 2010.

Currently we are on the 8th bar of a TD buy setup and although unlikely we could still have a close back above the TDST support at 141.53 tonight which would give the bulls some hope, although faint. Taking these developments into consideration I will remain on the sidelines for now and see how things develop with a view to selling strength at a later date or attempting small longs upon the completion of the 9 count TD buy setup or a close back above the TDST support at 141.53.

AUDUSD  
  
Although the bulls are still in control on the weekly chart the formation of a bearish outside bar last week alerted me to a possible top formation. This looks as though it was the first sign that the bears were finally emerging from their Australian winter hibernation, better late than never. I had been hoping to join the bears on route to firstly the lower daily BAT support level of 0.8890 however the opportunity failed to materialise. Currently the bears are just 71 pips from their first hurdle having left me behind and I won’t be chasing them from here. I will now move to the sidelines here until we remove the lower support of 0.8890 at which point I will attempt small longs with a view to selling from a higher level around the 0.9100 level.

The bulls are in control here on both the daily and weekly timeframe however their dominance is coming under threat as it appears the bears are sharpening their claws. Since the bulls took the upper daily BAT resistance level of 1.6554 they have really failed to make any progress and even produced a breakout failure. We are currently hovering right around the 60 day SMA and the 55 week EMA and should these levels be taken to a close I fear for the bulls. Taking this into consideration I would rather sit on the sidelines and see if the bulls can hold the MA levels or the bears can take them out. Should the latter play out the bears will have their sights on the lower daily BAT support at 1.5984 which if taken would be an important victory for the bears in the overall battle and open the way for a move to the 1.5 level initially where the weekly BAT support is situated.

The rule of my daily and weekly analysis is as follows:  
  
Break of **_upper_** BAT Resistance:  
  
a) Look for a retracement of at least 25% from the high made post-bat breach to the swing low (_draw fibo from high to low_)  
b) watch for **_bearish_** thrust bars  
c) **_close_** back above the **_last_** **_bearish_** thrust bars **_high_** = **_Bullish_** confirmation  
d) look for opportunities to go **_long_**  
  
Break of **_lower_** BAT Support:  
  
a) look for a retracement of at least 25% from the low made post-bat breach to the swing high (_draw fibo from low to high_)  
b) watch for **_Bullish_** thrust bars  
c) **_close_** below the **_last_** **_bullish_** thrust bars **_low_** = **_Bearish_** confirmation  
d) look for opportunities to go **_short_**  
  
I will also look for opportunities to go trade just after the daily breach if it is not in agreement with the weekly as it is more likely to give a strong retracement initially.  
  
Hope this helps,  
  
Cheers  
Foggytrader![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
p.s. Just to let everyone know I am a little busy at the moment but the pairs I have not commented on this morning I am on the sidelines with all but USDCAD where I am looking to go long still, with the 1.0644 5 minute TDST support level the current opportunity should we get there and have a bounce. I will do full analysis of what happens the rest of the day and post them over the weekend in anticipation of next weeks trading. Looking at GBPJPY at the moment, if it closes where it is then I will look for opportunities to go long with a short-term target before I add to my short position later for an eventual move to 131 - 125.

No problem, glad someone is getting involved. I don't see me taking anymore trades this week. But I am sure there will be more opportunities next week.   
  
Out of interest, my only regret this week is shown in the chart below. I had been calling to go long for about the past two weeks on USDCAD but let my guard down and missed this one on the 15 minute. I don't often use the 15 minute chart especially for the likes of GBPJPY but if the risk is low enough I do take signals from time to time on the this timeframe. In this particular example the risk was only 13 pips. Although I am gutted I missed it, the chart only goes to increase my confidence that my methods are correct. I can assure anyone reading my thread that these opportunities present themselves every week, and what I am trying to do on this thread is tell people which ones to look for based on my experience.  
  
  
Cheers

Thanks for the question magnus,  
  
I would view the first example as a perfect setup and the second as a void setup. The second one closes below the TDST support and from my experience the highest it will go from there is the low of the 9th bar in the TD sell setup which produced the TDST support. I would leave the second one and await another opportunity. Perhaps if there was a TDST support level on the 15 minute chart at the same place it could be a bounce on that timeframe but otherwise, yes, I would just leave it.  
  
Hope that answers your question, but yes, you have to be strict.  
  
Cheers

I am surprised that few people follow this system as one can easily compound the account risking very little as far as I have seen this system inthe last coulple of days. I will do my analysis and backtesting on this as it got me excited. I have no problem of trading any system as long as the risk on each trade is small relative to the potential reward, this to me fits the profile. I have never traded nay sytem with such small stop loss levels

At the risk of sounding pedantic, Foggy has mentioned throughout this thread that there is discretion involved in this _method_.  
  
Time-served, market experience and having [relatively] longer-term views seem crucial here.  
  
(note: I reserve the right to be wrong)

Hi FoggyTrader,  
  
I have been following this thread for a week and had traded with some positive results. I liked this system with its low risk trades. I have some doubts and hope you can clarify for me.  
  
1\. Do you only use the cureent day support and resistant lines for entry? Do you use earlier days S/R lines for referance or entry when you enter a trade?   
  
2\. Do you only use the first failure candle as entry candle disregarding any subsequent failure candles that follow, irrespective of the size of the first or following candles?  
  
3\. Do you only enter long when the candle breach and bounce off the support line? What if the prices break above a last red or resistant line, before a new red/green line is formed and turn back to the same red line and bounce from the line, do you use this line as a long entry?  
  
Appreciate your reply.  
  
Thanks and regards,  
lau  
  
ps. the TDCount indicator seem to slow down my pc. Anyway to solve this problem?

In indicator settings change "Numberbars" from 5000 to 1000 and should be fine.

Hi All,  
  
Have been following this thread since the start of this thread. Personally, i'm a fan of TD Combo, TD Sequential and TDST.  
  
I'm grateful to all contributors to this thread to make TDST trading alive. I've been following quietly and benefited from this thread. Thank you all.  
  
However, i have the following personal issues which, i hope anyone of you can help me to overcome:  
  
1\. Can anyone suggest / help to move the wordings on the right side of the chart to the left side of the chart?  
  
2\. Can anyone upload the a version of the TD Combo indicator (if any) that STICKS to the original TD Combo rules? It's so hard to find one because most (if not all) writers of free TD Combo indicator wrote to their personal preference and application. I'm not saying that they are wrong, it's just that i like to stick to the originals....![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Just to share: I would use TD Como on Daily and below timeframe and TD Sequential on Weekly chart.  
  
I found the attached TD Sequential from MQL4 Community and it seems to stick to TD's original rules (i think). It also draws the TDST levels and matches the TDST levels as provided in this thread.

Hello 8800,  
  
Glad to hear you are getting something out of my thread,  
  
To answer your first question, The reason I added the numbers to the counts (the big numbers below/above the TDST lines) is because I see them as a sequence. For example, lets say there are 3 TD buy setups giving us 3 TDST reisistance levels numbered obviously 1, 2 and 3. Lets then say number three and two are breached but number one has not been tested but then we get another TD buy setup giving us a new number 1 TDST resistance level. I then disregard the old number 1 and view the new number 1 as the start of a new trend/sequence. So to answer your question, I use the support/resistance lines if they are on the previous day so long as they are still part of the current sequence/trend. This is not part of DeMarks methods but my own as far as I can tell.  
  
To answer your second question, yes, I only use the first candle not any other, this tells me that there is a clear failure.   
  
To answer your third question, I only enter the bounce off the TDST support or resistance lines. There are a number of different ways to trade DeMark. If you wish to trade the close above TDST I would recommend that when you get a close above a resistance level I would look for a failure of the 9 bars high and if you get a close below the TDST support level I would look for a failure of the 9 bars low to go short. Personally, I don't really trade these kind of setups at present but they are there for sure.   
  
I only really trade bounces off the TDST levels and try not to complicate things, why bother!  
  
Hope this helps,  
  
Cheers  
Kevin

Hello camvcvoo,  
  
To answer your first question, there is no point moving the data to the left hand side of the screen, then you can't really see it for bars on the chart and besides, thats where the history data appears when you use that function. Personally, I don't have the data showing until I have a setup then I change it to true, perhaps if having it on the right hand side of the chart is such a problem you could try doing that.  
  
To answer your second question, I don't really understand what you mean, follow the original rules? The indicator I use follows DeMarks TD setup rules but doesn't give you the 10th, 11th, 12th and 13th bars. If someone can re-code the indicator to this feel free.  
  
I have tried the indicator you have posted before, it gives me a sore head. Keep things simple!  
  
Cheers

AUDUSD  
  
The Aussie bulls took control of this pair on the daily chart by breaching the upper BAT resistance level of 0.6843 on the 19th of March this year. Since this breach we have seen a rally of some 2500 points surpassing the 2nd Fibonacci target of 0.8447 by 958 points in the process. We have now also had 5 TD Sell setups along the way without testing the TDST support levels. Personally, I would argue that the bull trade is extremely overcrowded here and getting involved at current levels is not the play. However, I would need to see a break of the 0.8893 level before becoming involved on the bear side of this trade from a daily perspective.  
  
The Aussie bulls also have control of this pair on the weekly chart since they surpassed the 0.7990 upper BAT resistance level on the week of the 24th of May this year and are currently protected all the way down to the 0.8033 level. Having come some 248 pips short of the first Fibonacci target of 0.9653 and posted a bearish outside bar formation two weeks ago it looks as though the bulls are going to have a fight on their hands. Last week I attempted to join the bears following the bearish outside bar however I see that opportunity as passed now and will wait for an opportunity to get involved from a daily perspective.  
  
I will remain on the sidelines until the daily level of 0.8893 is breached.

EURGBP  
  
  
Although the bulls have control of this market all the way down to the 0.8229 level from a weekly perspective, the bears have made a significant statement by breaching the 0.8866 lower BAT support on the daily chart. In a situation where the daily break goes against the weekly bias I recommend trading the bounce of this break as I did two weeks ago by suggesting long trades up to the 61.8% retracement level. Price has now failed twice at the 50% retracement level and should we get a close below the last bullish thrusts low of 0.9037 we could see a move down to the 0.8477 level initially.   
  
I will remain on the sidelines until the daily bullish thrusts low of 0.9037 is removed to a close or the upper daily BAT resistance of 0.9289 is breached.

EURJPY  
  
  
Having been under control of the bears on the weekly chart since August 2007 the bull’s break of the upper daily BAT resistance in March this year lacked any follow through. The bulls finally lost their last line of defence on Friday by losing the significant lower daily BAT support level of 129.42 and handing full control back to the bears. Although these are significant development in the longer-term picture one still can’t ignore the hammer formation posted on Friday therefore as we have had a breach of the lower BAT support but also a reaction I will attempt to take small longs this week up to the 50% retracement line at 133.02 while waiting for the low of a bullish thrust to be removed to a close at which point I will look to go short for a target of 119.29 initially.  
  
I will attempt small longs up to the 133.02 level while I look for the low of a bullish thrust bar to be taken to a close.

Since breaching the upper BAT resistance level of 1.3452 back in March of this year EURUSD has been in control of the bulls. The bullish outlook was also supported and confirmed following the removal of the weekly BAT resistance in MAY. Currently until we test either the daily TDST level of 1.4578 or the daily BAT support level of 1.4319 I will remain on sidelines for this pair.

GBPCHF  
  
Since removing the BAT resistance level of 1.7096 last week the bulls have regained control here on the daily chart. However, unless the bulls can remove the 1.7940 weekly BAT resistance level, the bears will remain in overall control here. Following the removal of the daily level I took some short positions targeting the 61.8% retracement level at 1.6730. Those positions were closed out for a profit and I moved to the sidelines. Since then we have kept going and made two more bearish thrust candles. While the lower daily BAT support of 1.6181 holds I will look to buy a retest of the last bearish thrusts high at 1.6697 should this level be removed to a close targeting the 1.7723 level initially.  
  
  
I will remain on the sidelines unless we close above 1.6697 or remove 1.6181

GBPJPY  
  
Since breaching the lower daily BAT support at 144.31 the bears took control of this pair on the daily chart. With bulls having control on the weekly chart it was a question of who was going to come out on top and I believe that has almost been decided with events last week. This has however come as no surprise with the bulls unable to remove the TDST resistance at 152.78 then failing to hold the 60 day SMA. On Friday morning the bears ran riot removing the TDST support level of 141.53 with ease while also removing the trend breakout point at 139.69. I see these developments as confirmation that the bears have taken full control of this market and have the weekly lower BAT support of 131.96 in their sights. Should this be broken we open up a move to sub-100 levels into 2010. Monday will see us on the 9th bar of a TD buy setup and after the hammer candle which was also a bounce from the TDST support level on Friday I would be happy to look for opportunities to go long despite my overall bearish stance however I will be using a tight daily stop while holding my other short position and adding to that at higher levels or the recapture of a bullish thrusts low to a close.  
  
I will look for opportunities to add small long positions with tight stops while holding my short position and possibly adding to this at a higher level

GBPUSD  
  
The bulls are in control here on both the daily and weekly timeframe however their dominance is coming under threat as it appears the bears are sharpening their claws. Since the bulls took the upper daily BAT resistance level of 1.6554 they have really failed to make any progress and even produced a breakout failure. We are currently hovering right around the 60 day SMA and the 55 week EMA and should these levels be taken to a close I fear for the bulls. So far the Bulls are holding above the 60 day SMA and the 55 week EMA and while they do I am happy to look for opportunities to go long.

USDCAD  
  
Since breaching the upper BAT resistance level of 1.0813 on the 29th of October USDCAD has become bullish on the daily chart. Following this development I waited for the 25% retracement and initiated long-term longs following the close above the last bearish thrusts high. However, these longs have since been removed as we see some wild price swings in the battle between the bulls and bears. While I am happy to take longs at current levels I am still aware that the bears have full control of this pair on the weekly timeframe and with double TDST resistance levels having been formed on the daily chart at 1.0851 should we get long I would move my stop as we approach that level with a view to possibly selling a failure there.  
  
I will look for opportunities to go long until 1.0416 is removed.

USDJPY  
  
The bears have been in control of this pair since August 2007 on the weekly chart achieving the second Fibonacci target of 91.32 in October 2008. The weekly upper BAT resistance is currently on the move and situated at around the 96 level protecting the bears. The bears also have control of this pair on the daily chart with room to go lower to the 83.48 second Fibonacci level. Currently with the price past the second Fibonacci on the weekly and between the first and second target on the daily this pair offers nothing in terms of risk reward. I would need to see the removal of the upper daily BAT resistance of 90.94 removed before becoming involved here.   
  
I will remain on the sidelines until the upper daily BAT resistance is removed at 90.94

Obviously this can't ruled out but I wouldn't expect to see GBPJPY reaching 154.28 again for a long time. Like I say though, you always need to prepare for both scenarios which is why I am looking to go long in the early part of this week as we had a good bounce from the daily TDST support level and a move higher, perhaps even to the 154.28 level can't be ruled out.

GBPUSD  
  
We had a slight bounce from the 5 minute TDST level of 1.6493, although not a clear failure candle, we did fail to remove it to a close therefore orders were placed to buy 1 pip above the high. However, as shown in the second picture, price closes below the low of the touch candle therefore orders were cancelled.

GBPJPY  
  
As I posted in my analysis, I am looking for opportunities to go long following the bounce from the daily TDST support level of 141.53 and the fact that we are on the 9th bar of a TD Buy Setup. The first picture below illustrates that I have picked out the 140.20 level as a possible area to buy on a failure. The second chart backs this up and shows that there is a TDST support level at 140.28. This strengthens the chance of a bounce around that area which is why I have singled it out. Both charts also illustrate the fact that we have had several void signals so far this week keeping us out of trouble according to my rules.  
  
This strategy will hold unless we make another TD Sell sequence giving us a new TDST support level to buy from.

As posted in my analysis, I have been looking to go long this week. Here is the first opportunity with 17 pips risk. I had zoom in a bit for you to see this one and I had to enter this one manually as price was to close to place orders.

We have just had a new TD Sell Setup producing a new TDST support level at 142.01. I would now recommend keeping a close watch on this level for a failure and chance to go long.

We got a touch of the afore mentioned 142.01 TDST support level with not a severe enough failure for me and especially as the risk is 88 pips. I will leave this one and wait for another opportunity. Should we get down to the 140.20/28 level as mentioned before I will take a bounce from there or if we produce another TDST support level before then.

Thanks rbk,  
  
I have thought about that before but and decided it would just complicate things. As you may have gathered, I am a bit particular about what support/resistance levels I like to trade so having alarms going off for every hit would eventually send me crazy. I don't spend much time at the screen, I set my alerts in metatrader for the levels that concern me and go off to do other things. Honestly, the alert system in metatrader is good enough.  
  
Glad to hear you are getting something from my trading methods.

Had another signal to go long here but we quickly had a close below the touch candle therefore I cancelled the orders. While my long from earlier is still holding on.

As mentioned in my analysis yesterday night, I am looking to take long opportunities in this pair. I am currently watching for a reaction around the 1.6386 (30 min TDST support), 1.6374 & 1.6372 (both 5 minute TDST support) for a chance to go long. As there are three TDST levels so close together this should be an area well protected by the bulls.

hey foggy, this looks pretty interesting. i already have a really nice trading entry method but this looks like it could be awesome for managing trades also. for example, if i'm Long eurusd, the pattern is a nice way of objectively identifying price swings so as to trail stops in a trend. have you ever done this? for example, lets say you follow the pattern and you're in a long trade. you take profit as usual, but have you ever let a partial position run and just trail below the support levels until a short trade is triggered? seems very promising. im going to look into this since i think combined with the right support levels you could make some verry sweet risk to reward ratios. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Hello Nick,  
  
Explain more about what you mean by the pattern?  
  
I tend to try and stick with targets and don't usually employ trailing stops and I do take partial profits in my trades then I let the rest run although still with a long-term objective.  
  
I am interested to hear any suggestions you may have however as you have probably herd me say a number of times before, I don't like to complicate things to much.

Price made its way down to my prefered buying level as posted earlier. It didn't quite get down to the 5 minute level of 1.6374/72 but it did touch and bounce from the 30 minute TDST support level with a risk of 47 pips so I took this one.

Yes, correct. Primarily I stick to the 5 minute timeframe but if there is a cluster of TDST support/resistance levels on multiple timeframes I will take a bounce from those levels assuming the risk suits.  
  
Remember, the reason I started this thread is to show people how to trade TDST support and resistance levels as I do. I am posting my analysis and giving directional recommendations however, it is entirely up to the trader to decide for themselves the risk, timeframe and direction they want to trade. To be a good trader you must understand the markets and be able to look at a chart with a subjective view and decide how you would like to trade. I am simply showing you a good method of how to enter for very little risk, after that you need to use your own experience and skill to make a return.  
  
I would like to think I am helping people learn how to subjectively trade currency pairs with little risk, then I am happy.

Just for training purposes here as I had to pop out today and missed this one. As posted in my analysis yesterday, I was looking for an opportunity to go long on this pair. The chart below shows a nice entry on the 5 minute chart, long at 129.17 with a stoploss at 128.85. Looking quite well now, but I am sure there will be more opportunities.

I use the metatrader alert so I know if a TDST support/resistance levels are hit. Unfortunately, I can't be at my screen 24 hours a day so sometimes I miss a trade or two. My advice to you would be not to let it worry you, there is always another opportunity. It is just not possible to catch every trade on every timeframe, just take what you can get and if you miss a few you miss a few, so long as you keep making a profit at the end of each week, month and year. I don't let those type of things alter how I trade, I just get on with it.  
  
Hope this answers your question.

After reviewing the daily chart I have decided to move this trade to breakeven. We made a higher high than Friday and closed lower, I would prefer to limit my exposure to this trade.

Hi Foggytrader,  
You have done well explaining this concept, I have had Tom DeMark's book for a few years, and have been aware of this set up, but have never applied it, as I didnt like to count the bars. Indicators are great for doing it, and your thread has drawn my attantion to it. So I am getting back to study The New Market Timing Techniquies. Lets see how it will develop.  
Thanks for the thread and your commitment to it make so useful to other traders.   
Wishing you many good trades,  
2be

Now I hope all you traders that can trade the Asian session caught this one last night. As I recommended on Sunday night, I was looking for opportunities to go long on this pair. I missed one yesterday afternoon but there was an even better one last night with only 12 pips risk. As you can see from the picture below, TDST support was at 129.31, we made a low of 129.31 and a bounce. Very nice setup with only 12 pips risk.

Just to update everyone, I have been using a trade management file for all my entries to calculate how they would fair using my 2% risk 7% target idea. I can tell you that yesterday, my USDCAD trade would have made 2% profit then breakeven for the second unit. The EURJPY trade (which yes I missed but can still count) would have made 7% profit. The GBPUSD trade would still be open and down a little so we will call that one -2%. Then the trade in this post would have banked 7% when we hit 130.02 last night as the risk was so small. So thats 14% up for the week so far. I am having the file coded still but hope to start using it in the new year.

Thankyou 2be,  
  
Well I always wondered why none of the DeMark threads have ever taken off here so decided it was about time it was done right. The actually entry is so easy, there is only a line and a candle. It is basically mechanical in rule, the chart is pleasing on the eye and the risk is really small. What more do you want!?  
  
I would recommend you get the DeMark Indicators (Bloomberg Market Essentials: Technical Analysis) by Jason Pearl. It is the most advanced DeMark book out there, it gives you the rules for all of Thomas DeMarks stuff.

Just to update you on my current view on each pair, nothing has changed since Sunday night apart from GBPCHF. Looks like I move my GBPUSD trade to breakeven to quickly but thats life. I made the decision which I was happy with at the time and I don't dwell on these things because I know with DeMark that there is always another opportunity around the corner.

Hi Foggytrader,  
The book has been orderred from Amazom, could not risk not to have it. (it is just over £10.00, so not a fortune). I have read the previous two books by Tom DeMark, it takes a bit of commitment to get out the goddness from them, so a simplified verssion of Tom's work is most welcommed. I have been using some of his indicators for several years, but not the seqentialone, so I am returning to it now.  
BTW yesterday, good call on G/U, the pair I trade most.  
Have a great day,  
2be

That is absolutely the right attitude.  
Markets have been very nervous for the last several months, so if a strategy provides good pips at the current conditions, it will be even better when the currencies trends last a bit longer as it used to be.

Thanks 2be,  
  
Will be good to have someone else on board. I am travelling at the moment so wont be making any trades in the next 3 hours as the connection while travelling is not the best. Didn't look like there was much going on when I last checked 5 minutes ago and my GBPCHF trade is looking ok.

Hi Gutek,  
G/U seems to be trending up, and the count on M5 seems to throw a continuation atm, so I am not shorting it atm. Are you using BAT or something else to assist in trend strenght and direction?  
The sequential indicator on shorter TF migh also show a continuation, but I have to to some studies of this subject.

Well, I guess that I also need to study this subject for a while. I dont use BAT idicator but I watch higher TF for channels, support, resistances and momentum candles to have some bigger picture of current situation.

Unlucky with the stoploss Gutek, but as you say they do happen. As you know I am only looking for long entries on GU so short wasn't really the play although it was a good failure. Atleast you certainly understand the entry method, you just need to master what direction to take or whether to take no direction at all.  
  
As I travelled back home today my GBPCHF made good progress and also reached the 7% of account target at 1.6600. That is now 2 EURJPY 7% wins and one GBPCHF 7% win this week along with a 2% win in USDCAD and a 2% win with GBPUSD. The latter will make the 5% part of the target should it hit 1.6646 any time soon. But regardless of that, so far that would be 25% profit for the week so far. I don't really like to boast about numbers I haven't really actually made but I think I can in this instance as I have posted all my trades along with analysis of which direction I was looking for the day before so I can say if I use this particular money management rule that my profits may increase. As I posted earlier, I am getting the scripts coded so anyone who wants to try them can.

Still happy to take longs here, it is actually a double touch and failure here although it is at the top of the daily range which isn't the best but know one really knows. We have just closed below the first TDST support of 143.84 and we are currently below the low of the touch candle as I speak so I will likely cancel this one in 2 minutes.

Ah yes, chickening out of trades. The only thing that can stop that is experience and confidence. No book can help you there to my knowledge. Personally, I was lucky, I had a really good mentor (if you’re reading this you know who you are YZ) and he basically taught me everything I know although that wasn’t really enough. I always say to people that the main hurdle I had to overcome in trading was being able to lose. You must accept that most of the time you will have loosing positions, the trick however is to keep going regardless and if your money management and techniques are right you will eventually make a profit. When you have a losing trade and your next setup presents itself, don’t remember the losing trade, think positive and believe that this is going to be the winning trade. You must go into trading each signal with a clear and open mind and don’t allow past experiences to cloud your judgement. With trading you make decisions in the moment, sometimes they will pay off and other times they won’t, unfortunately it is not an exact science but if you keep making a profit week in week out then eventually you will overcome the apprehension that keeps you out of trades. I do believe that the way I trade DeMark however is as good as any a method of trading to help you overcome this.

I moved my stop to breakeven on this one, we have moved 130 pips from my entry at todays peak and come up against a TDST resistance level at 1.6619 on the 15 minute chart. Although I don't see this as a great barrier to the bulls, I am in near the low of the day and should this area be challenged again I would think the bulls are losing the battle. I have set my long-term target for this one at the 1st Fibonacci projection level of 1.7720.

My commentary from Sunday night still holds, and I see the bearish weekly thrust opportunity is fading and until I see either a break of the lower daily BAT support at 0.8893 or an attempt at the weekly TDST resistance level of 0.9790 I see no reason to get involved here.

EURGBP  
  
I was planning to wait until we either take out the upper BAT resistance at 0.9287 or we remove the last bullish thrusts low (0.9037) to a close before I got involved here. However, today we have completed the 9th bar of a TD sell setup and we have failed to close above the 50% retracement level for 3 days now giving me a clear signal that the bears are ready to take this pair lower. Therefore, I am now actively seeking opportunities to go short on this pair.

Although I was looking to go long yesterday and today and we had two opportunities both of which were successful I will now stand aside here and wait for further developments. We are bearish on both the daily and weekly so I would prefer to wait for higher levels to sell with a view of a move to 119.23 into next year.

Still absoloutly no reason to get involved here on the bull or the bear side of this market. Until we get down to the daily BAT support level of 1.4319 there is not much going on here.

As I posted today I was looking to go long and got a quick signal this morning and I was filled at 1.6490. We are now some 100 points from my entry level so I have moved it to breakeven and I will now continue to look for more long opportunities. After completing the 9th bar of a TD Buy setup today at the same time as the EURGBP completes a 9th bar of a TD Sell setup I am happy to stick to my long pound, short EURO/CHF.

GBPJPY  
  
I had been hoping to get long at lower levels on Monday and today however this never materialised. I did get a signal to go long at 144.12 with a stop at 143.71 but like I say I would have prefered to go long at lower levels but we will see how it goes. Unlike EURJPY where I am taking a back seat, I am more bullish of the pound accross the board so I am happy to still look for longs on this pair at current levels but will keep tight stops as the overall outlook for this particular pair is bearish.

As you will know I was looking to go long and did get long at 1.6411 on a 30 minute entry but was tricked by the daily close yesterday and was stopped out at breakeven. Not to dwell on this I am still happy to get involved on the bull side of this market until we go through the trend breakout point at 1.6689 then I will stand aside.

Having removed the low of the bullish outside bar I will now take a back seat here and wait for either a test of the TDST support at 1.0263 or a close back above today's bearish thrusts high at 1.0577.

Yes, well TDST support levels can be good areas to trail stops and resistance levels can be good to trail sell positions. As you know I look for longer-term targets although I am planning to add the 2% risk strategy into the new year.

We have just seen GBPUSD close below TDST support on both the 5 minute and the 15 minute chart. I have singled out the 1.6504 on the 5 minute and 1.6498 on hte 15 miute chart as an ideal area to buy into weakness should we get a bounce there.

I am looking to sell this pair now and have singled out the 0.9106 TDST resistance level as an ideal opportunity.

Things are panning out as anticipated however no action on the DeMark front as of yet. EURGBP came within 2 pips of my prefered selling level before coming off somewhat and we now have a new selling level at 0.9103 to keep an eye on. GBPJPY and GBPCHF have also provided new buying levels at 144.45 and 1.6558 respectively and thus far GBPUSD has no interesting levels.

GBPJPY - Hypothetical Forward Testing Update  
  
Just a quick update to illustrate that hypothetically my GBPJPY would have met the 2% initial target level at 144.94 on my entry from last night and the second unit would now be a breakeven. Shown below is my trade management file I hope to have computed into scripts in the next week or so but so far the forward testing looks very promissing.

How could you have banked over 500 pips? As I said yesterday, you have to let things go. There are always more opportunities to make pips, its no big deal, unless you make it one, just be patient.   
  
Just look at my posts, some of the trades I have missed but called, moved to breakeven and been stopped but its gone in my direction. But over the course of the three weeks I am still well in profit so I am happy, you have to learn to take what you get and be ready for your next opportunity. Suddenly the weeks and months will pass and you will look back and think, nice I have a profit and you will then forget all the missed chances.   
  
Its actually like caddying, my golfers always remember their bad shots and tell me they should have shot 5 over par and not 10 over par but they forget about the time they bounced out of a bunker or finished a foot away from a bush. What would have happened if they went in the bunker or the bush, their score could have been higher. The point is, just try to remember the good trades you make, that bit of luck that kept you in a trade which become a profit and forget about missed opportunities as they are gone now, nothing you can do about it.

Thanks for your advice, I could have banked over 500 pips as I use multiple lots in my trades depending on how confident I am on the trade. I will be taking golf lessons from next year as my weakest point is impatience and getting pissed off too quickly on stop outs. There is a nice golf course 5 minutes from my house so hopefully will help me to destress in times like this. I have already closed my charting program I ma not in the right frame of mind

You don't really.  
  
These "issues" sort themselves out as your confidence grows in your method and you see tangible, irrefutable results.  
  
The only thing you can do in the meantime is acknowledge them as best you can and continue with your method.

EURGBP  
  
Highlighting the fact that this pair had become extremely bearish last night following the completion of a TD Sell Setup coupled with a clear failure at the 50% Fibonacci retracement level during the last few session. We have now reached the critical support level of 0.9037 which if taken to a close tonight will have the bulls running for cover. Should this level be taken to a close I will still look for short opportunities until we hit the daily TDST support level of 0.8899 at which point I will watch from the sidelines to see how things develop. This strategy holds unless the bulls can remove todays high.

A question...  
  
You obviously use the close of the day.  
  
Now, do you use the standard 22:00GMT close - or what ever your platform is set at (which I think would regard the close at 23:00GMT if it is MIG)?

I use the close time of my broker which is 23:00 GMT.

GBPJPY  
  
Just as I was about to take a back seat so far as going long GBPJPY and we get quite a nice failure candle. Should this one hold out I will keep a tight stop on it as I feel the long end of this trade has almost played itself out and the risk is more to the downside over the next few days. I have a target of 147 just below the 60 day SMA for my other long should it get there, if not my short from 148 is still holding.

Feel your pain on this one... if you'd have skipped the #3 count and gone for the #2, you'd be high and dry... it's a knife-edge!!

Yes, well although the #2 count was a better candle it did close below the TDST support level therefore was not an entry according to the rules.

I have been waiting to go long on this pair all day, the actual touch candle wasn't a real failure candle but the low of the touch candle was the TDST support and the reaction over the next few bars were good so I took this one, I maybe right I maybe wrong, we will see.

Yeah, just checked my MT4 feed and, true, it did.  
  
My eSignal feed showed it closing above (well, the TDST support was calculated as lower than MT4).

Sometimes different feeds will give different TDST levels and bounces, nothing you can do about that, just take what you see on your chart, it will even itself out over time.

Looks as though the bulls are finally taking a hold on this pairing, should they get through the 1.6875 level we should see them go as high as 1.7296 initially. I have taken my stop to breakeven here.

EURGBP  
  
I posted last night that it was make or break time for EURGBP with the 0.9037 level holding the key. This level was indeed held by the bulls giving them some hope. However, all my previous analysis still holds, we breached the lower BAT support (Bearish), we failed at the 50% retracement several times (Bearish) and we made a bearish thrust yesterday (Bearish). Therefore, until the bulls can remove the bearish thrust of yesterdays high at 0.9149 I will continue to look for opportunities to go short. Currently I see a failure of the 0.9104 level as an ideal opportunity.

GBPJPY  
  
I am going to remove myself from the long side of this market now, we are approaching the 60 day SMA where I plan to close 100% of my long position. The speed of the rejection of the new low at 139.26 is more worrying for the bulls than the bears and I feel there will be plenty of bears waiting to join in around current levels to retest the new low area of 139.26. As I have pointed out in the chart below, the bears still remain in control here on the daily chart despite the quick rejection of the TDST support at 141.53 and I see this as a temporary development in the overall picture. I will only change my view should we close above the 60 day SMA however at that point I will become neutral and look to sell again on a retest of the 150.30 TDST resistance level.

GBPCHF  
  
After taking a long position following the completion of a TD Buy Setup on Monday I am now happy to add to that around current levels should we get a chance. I made one attempt this morning, perhaps at too high a level but the bounce was good so I was happy to enter. Having made a bullish thrust bar yesterday but still failing to take out the last bearish thrusts high to a close I see those two levels as being key. Should yesterdays 1.6555 low be removed to a close this opens us up to the lower BAT support at 1.6179. However, should we remove the 1.6696 level to a close this will support the bulls to retest the 1.7001 TDST resistance level initially.

GBPUSD  
  
This pair was looking constructive in the early part of the week and even last night as I took my long entry. However, this chart is telling me to stay on the sidelines at present. Having failed at the trend breakout point and the last bearish thrusts high yesterday I see no reason to get involved on either side here. I would now need to see a break below the MA levels or a close above the last bearish thrusts high of 1.6727 before I get involved here.

AUDUSD  
  
Although still no reason to get involved on a daily perspective here I still like this pair to correct from current levels and while the bearish outside bars high of 0.9405 holds I am very tempted to take some low risk entries on the short side of this market. I will be keeping an eye on the 5 minute TDST resistance level of 0.9316 as a possible level to short should we fail there. I don't have any particular levels I am looking at to cancel out this strategy but I just like this play so I will hold this strategy until we either close above the above TDST resistance in the 5 minute chart and therefore don't produce a failure or we move to lower levels.

EURJPY  
  
Looks like I may have left the long side of this market a little quick. I have attached the chart below as reference to anyone who unlike me still kept their bullish stance on EURJPY yesterday, as you can see in the chart we had a perfect bounce from TDST support last night and this one was only 10 pips risk. EURJPY has really been the performer of the week so far as demark entries are concerned. This would have been the third 7% gain of the week using my 2% risk 7% reward strategy, amazing. The trick remains though knowing which direction you want to look for and unfortunately here I took a back seat a day to early.  
  
_"There was actually another entry yesterday with 35 pips risk and the 7% target is 133.07"_  
  
Like I say though I am remaining on the sidelines here and will post when things change.

USDCAD  
  
As posted over the weekend, following the breach of the daily outside bullish bars low at 1.0416 I decided to take a back seat. However, while the bears fail to take this level to a close I will now look for a recapture of the 1.0577 level to a close as a trigger to re-enter this market on the long side.

We had a touch and bounce of the TDST support level but the risk is 78 pips and to high for me so I will leave this one for now.

EURGBP  
  
EURGBP spiked up to my prefered selling level and failed on the 15 minute and 30 minute charts and while it closed right on the 0.9104 level on the 5 minute chart it has failed to push any higher. Therefore orders are placed to go short at 0.9084 with a stoploss level of 09114. These orders wil remain in place unless the high of the breach bar at 0.9108 is removed to a close.

GBPCHF  
  
Ordinarily I would await the removal to a close of a thrust bars extreme before I get involved in a long-term BAT trade however, following the TD Buy Setup which completed on Tuesday this week I thought it was the ideal opportunity to enter the long side of this market. This was to be the right choice and I managed to add one position that morning.   
  
It was either going to be a close above the bearish thrusts high at 1.6696 or a close below the bullish thrusts low at 1.6555 which decided the fate of this market and it was the latter which played out to the close tonight. Following these developments I have closed out my long trade for a small profit and will now attempt to take short DeMark positions for an attack on the lower BAT support level of 1.6179. This strategy will hold until the bulls can remove the bearish thrusts high at 1.6696.

I had moved to sidelines on this pair following any lack of direction however yesterday saw a failure at the last bearish thrusts high at 1.6727 and the formation of a bearish outside bar therefore I am happy to look for low risk shorting opportunities. I took a failure of the number one TDST resistance and as I write this it has been stopped for -22 pips, I won't ignore the bearish outside bar though and will still look for shorting opportunities.

GBPJPY  
  
Seeing a bit of a recovery in the GBP pairs which goes against what the daily charts were suggesting following yesterdays close. I banked some profits on my GBPJPY long last night, perhaps a little hastely however it seemed to be the right course of action at the time and afterall profit is profit.  
  
I am still short this pair and I see two important factors which need to play out to get me involved for next week. I would prefer to see a failure of the 60 day SMA level and a continuation of the bear trend as I am already short, at which point I will start looking for opportunities to add to that. However, should the 60 day SMA be taken out to a close we will actually produce an outside bullish thrust bar which would flip the view and bring forward a case to enter the bulls side of this market for an attack on the TDST resistance at 150.29 initially. At this point I would prefer to sit on the sidelines and see how things shape up.

As I mentioned in my report last night, GBPCHF removed an important level to a close last night so I was waiting for an opportunity to go short. We have just had a complete failure of the 1.6647 TDST resistance level from yesterday producing a bearish outside bar in the process. I managed to get in on a bit of retracement so saved myself 8 pips.

I welcome you Maq as one of the traders who have benefitted immensely from foggytrader's method and he has been answering all my questions to help me understand it. If you are looking for a nmethod to enter low risk trades with an opportunity to bigger profits, in my opinion this is it.

Hi Foggytrader, I've been keeping up with your thread since you bega it. I'm a big fan of all of Demark's systems, and I'll be starting to get used to this one very soon, after I read his second book. I'm really interested in the money management you've been talking about, risking 2% to gain 7%. Would you be able to elaborate on the math (number of lots, stop loss and profit target) for that particular MM strategy? Thanks.

Thanks for your interest Paul,  
  
My MM idea is basically this, when I get a bounce/failure of a TDST level and it agree's with my long-term analysis I enter according to the normal rules using the same stoploss rule however I risk 2% instead as 1%.  
  
The 2% is split into two different units each risking 1%. The first unit has a target of 2%, once this is reached I move the second unit to breakeven and it has a target of 5%. Obviously the number of lots depends on the size of your account but I am currently testing scripts to enter the trade at a click of a button, so everything will be done automatically.  
  
It is in the early stages but so far it looks promissing, I am going to forward test it on all my live signals for the rest of this year then go live with this particular MM in January.  
  
Just to let everyone know and in case anyone has been using my analysis, I have been busy today so have stayed out of the markets but I will do some analysis tonight and will be trading as usual for the rest of the week.  
  
Cheers

AUDUSD  
  
Although the bulls are in control on both the daily and weekly timeframe I still see the posting of a bearish outside bar formation 3 weeks ago as a possible sign that the bears are becoming more involved here. In addition, as I have posted several times, the latest currency research report from Morgan Stanely points out that the Aussie Dollar is 40% overvalued against its American counterpart. Therefore while the high of the formation holds at 0.9405 I will continue to look for opportunities to go short.

EURGBP  
  
Since we breached the lower BAT support level I was looking for us to make some bullish thrusts which we did and on Friday we closed below the low of the final thrust bar which is the signal to go short. Therefore I will now be looking for opportunities to go short until either we remove Fridays high to a close or we reach the TDST support level of 0.8901.

EURJPY  
  
Developments over the past few weeks have re-asserted the bear to this market. Following the breach of the lower BAT support and the close below the TDST support we have seen a bear squeeze which is a worrying sign for the bulls. I am now waiting for a close below Fridays bullish thrust at 132.50 as a signal to attempt some shorts. Ths strategy will hold true until we remove the 9th bars low at 135.18 to a close.

EURUSD  
  
Currently I don't really see much on offer here in either direction. I am currently waiting for a close below the last weekly bullish thrusts low at 1.4829 to begin looking for short opportunities to target the daily BAT support level at 1.4492.

GBPCHF  
  
As anyone following this thread will know, I was long at 1.6490 following the 9th bar of a TD Buy Setup but closed out for a small profit following a bearish close on Thursday. Obviously now it looks like a bad move but it seemed the right decision at the time. Nevertheless, along with the EURGBP setup which is the opposite mirror to this one, I really like how this pair is setting up. I am currently looking for more opportunities to go long targeting the 1.7720 bull target level. This strategy will hold until Fridays low at 1.6525 is removed to a close or we go beyond the trend breakout point at 1.7109.

GBPJPY  
  
Interesting developments here over the past few sessions. We had an accelerated move to test the daily TDST support level at 141.53 and posted a bounce candle formation. Following that formation we have witnessed a fast bear squeeze which is a worrying development for the bulls. Although we have closed above the 60 day SMA again I am happy to attempt some small shorts should this level (147.04) be removed to a close. If this does not materialise I will look to sell a failure of the TDST resistance at 150.29.

I have attached a weekly chart to highlight some developments. We did close above the last bearish thrusts high last week. However, I still think the bulls need to recapture the 150.35 level to a weekly close to have a chance. With the daily TDST resistance level being at 150.29 it looks like this would be the ideal level to sell a failure should we get to that level again.

We have been bouncing off the SMA levels for a while now and I see these as the key levels to the market. I am waiting now for the removal of these levels to a close or the recapture of Fridays bearish thrusts high before I get involved.

USDCAD  
  
While the bullish outside bars low of 1.0416 holds to the close I am still happy to look for long positions at current levels. We have TDST support and resistance levels on the daily chart close by so this market is far from decided but full of opportunity.

USDJPY  
  
I thought we would have to wait for longer to get a BAT breach on this pair but we are moving ever closer following the moves towards the back end of last week. Friday also saw a close above the TDST resistance level of 90.39 which is a significant breakthrough for the bulls. I am now waiting for a breach of the upper BAT level at 91.46 before I become involved here at which point I will likely look for shorts as we remain bearish on the weekly chart.

We have just made a nice bounce from the TDSt support level, had to enter this one manually as price was close to the entry following the candle close, but in any case, I got in at the correct 1.0533 with a stop at 1.0508.

Well, here goes again, so far this morning two of my pairs have produced stop outs so lets see how this one fairs. We had a bounce from the TDST support from Friday at 1.6625, following this we didn't close below the low of the breach candle therefore the orders were held and are now triggered.  
  
Off out with the dog, none of my other pairs are anywhere near TDST levels, time for some fresh air...

EURGBP  
  
Just a quick update on EURGBP here. I was stopped out trying to short this pair this morning and since then it has rallied somewhat. We have produced two TDST resistance levels at 0.9085 and 0.9088 and I am now looking to sell a failure of those levels should we test them any time today.

GBPCHF - Forward Testing  
  
Bit of a funny day, two losers and one winner. I had -2% losers with EURGBP and USDCAD although my directional analysis was correct last night. As you can see below, the account history for today is -2% (approx), I have moved the second unit of GBPCHF to breakeven now so we will see if it can reach the 5% target at 1.6831.

Example - GBPUSD 4 Hour  
  
Just a quick post showing a good example of a DeMark setup. This particular example shows a failure of the TDST resistance level on the 4 hour chart. In this example though we also get a bearish outside bar which I would take as very strong signal. Now to enter the trade here would have been 140 pips however, this could possibly have been a good time to look for shorting opportunities on the 5 minte chart.

I was just about to do my analysis for this pair when we got a nice failure of the TDST resistance level. I was about to say that I was looking to sell strength following todays sell-off but this was a nice failure and my strategy is to go short so we will see how it goes.

AUDUSD - Forward Testing Account  
  
Please find below the forward testing entry, because the risk is only 10 pips on this entry we only need 32 pips to reach our 2% target then a further 30 (62 total) to make our 5% target.

AUDUSD  
  
This pair is getting close to the lower daily BAT support now so I would rather sell strength up to the 0.9141 level or stay on the sidelines here. This was to be my strategy last night but we had a good failure around 10pm so I took it. After a good looking start it got stopped out, and as I say being so close to the daily BAT now I would rather stay on the sidelines or sell strength.  
  
I have also attached the latest 4 hour chart, a few interesting formations there for training purposes.

Well, yes good set-up but it was stopped out before it could reach the 2% initial target.

EURGBP  
  
Not really working out as I expected so far this week, however as long as the bearish thrusts high from Friday holds I will continue to look for opportunitiesto go short. We just had a failure of the 0.9088 TDST resistance level so I placed orders to sell the low of the breach bar at 0.9076 with a stop of 0.9094. AS Iwrite this we have just closed above the high of the breach candle therefore the orders are cancelled. I'll attach th echart anyway.

It was a nice trade, we shouldn't just the quality of the decision by the outcome , it was still a nice and pristine trade to take. Failure of the TDST levels on 4hr charts work very well, more so if coupled with failure patterns. I am about to embark on a study looking specisifcally for those and just zoom in to 5 minute for setups as you have mentioned in your earlier post

EURJPY  
  
This really is the outperformer in the pack recently. I don't know whether everyone who trades this pair uses DeMark but the signals seem to work out perfectly. Over the past 24 hours we have had 3 failures/bounces of TDST levels, one was a buy -2% and two were sells both reaching the 7% target. Unfortunately I was a day late becoming involved here and the last signal occured during the Asian session as I was asleep. Hope anyone following this thread (if there is anyone) caught this one on the Asian session.  
  
In any case, I am still happy to look for opportunities to go short here.

EURJPY - Forward Testing Account  
  
The picture below shows the entry for the forward testing account. Again I didn't catch it at the actual entry point so saved a few pips, but these things happen from time to time so it is stil valid. So far the account is -4% for three entries so lets see how this one goes.

GBPCHF  
  
Just gone long GBPCHF at 1.6682 with a stoploss at 1.6657. Not looking the greatest of afternoons for the pound but I can't ignore what the dailies are still saying and it is a good bounce candle.

The file is downloaded, but it's got the name attachment.php - you need to rename it to the proper name - go to the directory where the file's been downloaded, right click & rename. It's either something to do with the way it was attached, or a bug within whatever browser you're using.

Seeing a bit of a retracement again, with a possible new higher low in place on the daily chart I fear the bears are losing this battle. Nevertheless, I will keep attempting to join this market on the short side currently awaiting a failure at the 0.9167 TDST resistance level.

While the bearish thrusts high of 0.9112 holds I will contunue to look for selling opportunities here. Although a great looking setup along with the one in GBPCHF, both are fighting opposites on the BAT with EURGBP in control of the bulls and GBPCHF the bears. Therefore, there is a reall battle going on here with no clear winner yet. I will stick with my strategy though and only take TDST resistance failures with the 0.9066 level in mind.

EURJPY  
  
This pair has been the outperformer since I started this thread in terms of good signals unfortunately my analysis has kept me away from most of the signals such is life but I did get 4% from this pair yesterday on the forward testing account and luckily I was out last night and missed the stop out trade, details will follow when I post the next statement from the forward testing account. In any case, I still see the Yen pairings with further to fall whether we see a bit of a retracement first or not, I will continue to take only short positions here with the 130.00 TDST resistance in mind.

GBPCHF  
  
While the bullish thrusts low of 1.6525 holds I continue to look for long opportunities. As I mentioned in the EURGBP commentary these pairs are fighting opposites on the BAT front and GBPCHF is under control of the bears still on the weekly so it seems we are struggling to make head way. There are currently no TDST support levels on the 5 minute chart to buy a bounce from so I will wait until one appears.

The bear squeeze we witnessed last week was a worrying sign for the bulls and this has played out this week with them losing almost all of last weeks range. While I would prefer to see a bit of a retracement higher to attempt more short positions I will still take all TDST resistance failures on this pair as the risk remains to the downside. I am currently waiting for a failure of the 143.80 TDST resistance level on the 5 minute chart.

We just had a good failure of the TDST resistance level mentioned, however, within a couple of minutes it was stopped out. I could speculate as to the importance of the TDST level mentioned as it was made late in the US session however with the demark method it doesn't matter when they are made really, sometime they work, sometimes they don't just like all trading methods. I will continue to look for selling opportunities later in the day.

GBPUSD  
  
I don't often like trading based on MA's however the 55 week EMA and the 60 day SMA can't be ignored on this chart currently. Having provided support to the market for several weeks it looks as though it is now prividing resistance with a failure of that level yesterday. While we remain below these averages I will continue to look for selling opportunities. I am currently view the 1.6308 TDST resistance level on the 5 minute chart as an ideal level to short should we post a failure there.

USDCAD  
  
Still waiting for the bulls to take a hold of this market and I fear they are running out of time. In a similar fashion to EURGBP and GBPCHF, the daily BAT breach is going against the weekly which is likely why we are struggling to make progress here. I am still happy to look for buying opportunities here until the bullish thrusts low of 1.0416 is removed. I had hoped to buy a failure of the 1.0543 TDST support on the 5 minute chart but that signal was void so I will wait until we either hit the number 1 TDST support level of 1.0524 or we make a new TDST support level to enter long.

Still see no reason to get involved here on a short or long term basis. I would need to see a breach of the upper BAT resistance level at 91.46 or a very good candle formation to attempt a trade in either direction here.

Forward Testing Account  
  
Just a quick post to update the forward testing account. After this mornings stopped EURGBP trade it is around -3%. We are still to have a full 7% winner so it is holding up well so far. I fear the markets may be a bit choppy with the run up to Christmas but I will still keep it going until the markets close for the festive period, if anything it will get me used to using the scripts, but I am sure it will be a good method to to use and I will be going live in January.

Forward Testing Account - -8.6%  
  
Tough day today with 4 stop outs from very good signals. The account is now down 8.6% but I will not be put off, it will only take one win and the week won't be to bad. There will be good days and bad, it is a question of whether you can handle the bad days and get back on the bike.

AUDUSD  
**_  
I think I have possibly fallen into the trap of looking for any reason to trade a pair with my new MM idea and AUDUSD falls into that category._**  
  
Looking at both the daily and weekly charts it is clear that the bulls are still in control here and following the weekly outside bar formation a few weeks ago the bears have failed to take advantage and remove any important levels. While this remains the case I see no reason to join this market on either side. Looking from a daily perspective I would need to see the bears test the 0.8893 lower BAT support and from a weekly perspective I would need to see the bulls test the 0.9790 TDST resistance on the weekly chart before becoming involved.

foggytrader, I think I woudln't get involved on this pair at this stage as I tend to think that we will not see any directiional moves until next year, my bias on this pair is to the short side so will have to wait for a lower BAT level removal, m y bet is if it does go down , this level will be breaached in the following year

EURGBP  
  
Following the close below the last bullish thrusts low I was expecting to this market make a move for the downside but as of yet it has failed to materialise. We have however made a succession of lower highs this week and although we have closed back above the bullish thrusts low for the last two sessions I am still happy to look for selling opportunities at current levels.  
  
Should we remove the close below bars high at 0.9112 to a close I will stand aside until we either test the BAT resistance at 0.9289 or remove another bullish thrusts low to a close.

EURJPY  
  
Since breaching the lower daily BAT support two weeks ago this market became bearish on all three major timeframes. It looks like I tried to get involved to soon here so I am now lookig at the 132.50 (_last bullish thrusts low_) as the ideal area to start looking for selling opportunities.  
  
I will hold this view unless we remove the 134.35 level.

EURUSD  
  
As we are currently on the 6th bar of a TD Buy Setup I would love to see this pair test the TDST support level at 1.4578 and the lower BAT support level of  
1.4492 at the completion of the setup next Wednesday.   
  
Should this scenario play out I would view this as an ideal opportunity to attempt short-term long positions targeting partial profits at the would be TDST resistance level of 1.5091. While I will hold a small proportion of the trade as we remain bullish on the weekly.

EURGBP  
  
This is one of the three pairs I currently see real opportunity for movement. I have been waiting for a while to get short and failed with a pip here or there keeping me out or stopping me. We got a failure at the current TDST resistance level 0.9048 so a short position has been taken. Thing's didn't go to well yesterday with the new MM idea so perhaps it won't work although I still think I got my daily analysis wrong I should have been on the sidelines with all pairs but for EURGBP, GBPCHF and USDCAD with only EURGBP giving me a true stop yesterday. I was guilty of over trading and am not scared to admit it, so lets see how things go. It might be hard for the next couple of weeks with the festive period but I will keep trying to see if I can make this work. Otherwise, nothing changes for my longer-term low risk DeMark method, you can still build up positions no problem using this method but I was trying to find a way to use it to get bigger profits quicker but it might not be possible. Time will tell.

Although I was stopped out earlier today on EURGBP, I'll continue going with the demo account, it will only take a couple of winners and we would be back on track so lets just see. We got a failure of the number one TDST support level, entry was at 1.0494 with a stop of 1.0480. Only 12 pips risk so the targets are close by and we have just closed the 1st unit as I was writing this thread for a profit of 2%. The second unit is at breakeven now so lets see if we can finally get a full 7% winner and the account won't look so bad after a bad week.

Nice finish to a bad week with the first 7% winner of the demo account. I hope this illustrates why I am trying to make this MM approach work. As the risk is so small, 12 pips in this case we only need a 70 pip move to bank 7% on our account. Yesterday was a bad day, I blame my own daily analysis on that for over trading with no real reason and if we'd have caught all the EURJPY trades this week and all the other trades since I started the thread, I am fairly sure (_I have no exact figures, check through the thread at my entries if you like_) that I would be well in profit. It might not be the best time to test this system with things winding down now for Christmas but I will continue my work. Just to point out, again my analysis of GBPCHF and EURGBP is spot on but we just haven't been able to get in with DeMark as of yet, but I am sure there will be many more opportunities into the new year and I will do my best (_if anyone is actually interested, not much so far_ ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61f.png?v=15.1)) to give everyone the best advice on how to trade my method as I can.  
  
In case anyone is interested, I plan to hold my live entry on this pair to the 1.1250 and will look to add to it where possible.

Hi Foggy,  
  
Question on the TD indicator. Once the indicator counts 9 candles does it fix or lock that count in or can it repaint depending on the close of the 10th candle. Alot of these indicators look wonderful in backtesting due to the fact they repaint but in real time they are of little value.

Hi Foggy,  
  
Based on my very limited experience with Demark I can't figure out why you entered this trade. The green 1-9 count support line wouldn't have formed until the close of candle 9 (at least that's when I think the support line is drawn) which is a bit higher that your entry point. It was a very good entry point I'm just not sure how you used the Demark method to enter at that point.

Hello Dave,  
  
Once the 9th candle closes the TD Count is locked in and will never change. You will however sometimes get different TD Counts from different brokers for obvious reasons but there is nothing we can do about that but again it won't happen often. Basically though it is not a re-painting indicator, if you read anything to do with DeMark you would already know this. The rule of a TD Setup is that the current bar must close lower than the close of four bars earlier. Only thing that would change that is if your broker was unreliable.  
  
Hope this helps,  
  
Cheers

Hello Again Dave,  
  
Thanks for your questions, please don't feel like you can't post anytime your not sure. Ok, so the chart below should clear up your query. As you can see we had a TD Sell Setup with the number one bar (TDST Support Level) started at 15:40 on Thursday. Yesterday at 13:25 we got a touch of this level (1.0484) and a close above it again. Orders would be placed to go long at the high of the touch candle plus spread. I was actually out at the time and got back after the signal so you will see the time of my entry is actually 14:48 but luckily the price came back and I was filled. But there was no doubt here it was a good entry with only 14 pips risk.  
  
Not really sure what you were meaning in your post, maybe I wasn't clear enough in my training examples. The examples I gave were perfect setups but we dont actually have to have a 9 counts 9th bar bouncing off the TDST support/resistance level to be a setup I just did them because they would be an ideal situation.

People talk about only taking pin bars etc but as you will see over the last few weeks of my thread it doesn't really matter, so long as price touches the TDST support or resistance and doesn't close below it again for support or above it again for resistance you just place your orders and hold them until either triggered or the price then closes over the touch candles extreme.  
  
Hope this clears up you question,  
  
Cheers

Hi Foggy,  
  
I noticed that every time I put any other lines on my chart and then switch to different time frame all other lines or notations disappear. I'm assuming the TD indicator has some erase function written into it. Any way to get around this?

Hello Dave,  
  
I am not sure if my indicator has an erase function (as I am no expert coder), but I am failry sure without the TD_Count file this happens anyway. You could always try saving your current chart as a template when you have all your lines on it then reload it once you have checked other timeframes. I will ask if there is an erase function however, If there is, I am sure it will be there for a reason.  
  
So did you get the idea on the USDCAD trade now?

Way to go foggytrader, key is to take trades as they appear and not worry about losses based on long term analysis, drawdowns will be there for sure, but what I like about it is that 1-3 trades can easily recover the drawdowns

AUDUSD  
  
Looking at both the daily and weekly charts it is clear that the bulls are still in control here and following the weekly outside bar formation a few weeks ago the bears have failed to take advantage and remove any important levels. While this remains the case I see no reason to join this market on either side. Looking from a daily perspective I would need to see the bears test the 0.8893 lower BAT support and from a weekly perspective I would need to see the bulls test the 0.9790 TDST resistance on the weekly chart before becoming involved.

EURGBP  
  
Been calling for selling opportunities since we removed the bear trigger level of 0.9037 on the 4th of December without success thus far. I will continue looking for chances to go short until we get closer to the TDST support level of 0.8901 at which point I will wait to see how it develops. As you can see from the daily chart, the bears have plenty of barriers in front of them if they are to reach the 0.8475 bear target and as we are still under control of the bears on the weekly chart I will watch the reaction of the TDST support levels to enter long in this market.  
  
To sum up, I am still bearish and still looking for opportunities to go short but I am wary of the bullish factors to this market and will be fully prepared to take longs should the opportunity present its self at lower levels.

EURJPY  
  
I was hoping that the bulls could push this market up to the last bullish thrusts low at 132.49 to initiate short positions. However, they failed and have posted quite a bearish candle on the daily chart on Friday. While tempted to look for shorts on the back of that I am happy to sit on the sidelines here and view GBPJPY at better levels to sell Yen strength.  
  
To sum up, although I am on the sidelines here I will start looking for selling opportunities should we move towards the 131/32 area.

EURUSD  
  
I really love how this pair is setting up and depending on the outcome over the next few sessions I see the possibility of opportunities in either direction. As you can see from the chart below we actually came within 6 pips of the TDST support level on Friday. I had a little photoshop fun with this chart and added an ideal scenario. If we can hit the lower BAT support and close back above the TDST support level while at the same time complete the 9th bar of a TD Buy Setup it will be an ideal opportunity to look for buying opportunities. However, should we close below the TDST support level and remove the BAT support I would still expect to see a retracement higher but should we reach the 9th bars low at 1.4842 this would present the ideal selling opportunity.

GBPCHF  
  
A complete mirror of the EURGBP analysis, I was hoping to go long after removing the bull trigger of 1.6697 to a close. I will continue to look for opportunities to buy until we get closer to the TDST resistance level of 1.7000. In addition, while we remain under the control of the bears on the weekly chart I will be ready to switch a legions and go long should we get a good failure of any of the TDST resistance levels above.  
  
To sum up, I will still be looking for long opportunities in this market until we test the TDST resistance level of 1.7000 at which point I will move to the sidelines and watch how things develop with the view of selling upon failure.

GBPJPY  
  
Unlike EURJPY, GBPJPY actually posted a bullish thrust on Friday however I am still happy to look for opportunities to sell this market after the bulls failed on a retest of the last bullish thrusts low at 145.40. I was short at higher level but was removed during the bear squeeze but still see plenty of downside potential at current levels.  
  
However, should the bulls remove the 60 day SMA I will take a step back and watch how thing develop.

GBPUSD  
  
As expected the MA's are providing the resistance here since they were removed them to a close last Tuesday. In a similar fashion to the EURUSD I would prefer to see if the bears can test the lower BAT support at 1.5988 before becoming involved while it may also be possible that we complete a TD Buy Setup at or around the lower BAT level which would be ideal. Should the bears test this level I will look for long opportunities initially as we remain under the control of the bulls on the weekly chart.

USDCAD  
  
Well, since breaching the upper BAT resistance level some weeks ago I have been looking for opportunities to go long. Following the removal to a close of several bearish thrusts highs followed by a failure the bulls seem to be struggling a little. However, I have managed to get one long position on Friday and I will be looking to add to that this week should the opportunity arise. With a double TDST resistance level appearing at 1.0851 I will take partial profits there and be ready to go short should we fail this level on the daily close while I will hold the rest of my position for the ultimate bull target at 1.1250.

Hi, just a question. Why do you only use the 9-bar setup counts and never the 13-bar countdown phase of the Demark theory? The 13 counts that follow the 9's are even more powerful...

Hi Foggy,  
  
I have alot of experience with MT4 platforms and you can put trendlines and arrows and all sorts of things on the charts and they stay on the charts as you switch from time frame to time frame. There are certain indicators that you place on your charts that erase all other items on the chart when t you change from one TF to another TF. This TD indicator must be one of them. Maybe someone with some programming experience can look into this and let us know what causes the indicator to erase all the other items on the chart.

On the weekly chart, is it a breach of a BAT line that tells you that the bulls are in control? Or something else?

Hi Foogy,  
  
What ATR setting are you using for the BAT indicator?

Hi Paul,  
  
Think I have posted this one at some point before, yes on the weekly chart the bulls will remain in control unless the bears can remove the 1.5004 level.  
  
I don't post the weekly charts every week unless there are significant developments.

Yes I know the 13 counts are powerful and I will count them myself on the daily and weekly charts as my indicator doesn't have them, although they would only be of use to me on the 5 minute chart if I was trading TD Setups which I am not. I do have my coder trying to add the 13 count to the file and will update it once it is finished.

For EURJPY I use a BAT setting of 5 and 7.0. With the BAT you need to play around and find your own settings that suit the market or timeframe. I have used the same settings for over a year and they won't change. Just remember to make sure your platform does't have any Sunday data on the chart as that will skew the BAT levels.

We have just completed a TD Buy setting providing a TDST resistance level at 0.9048. I see this as an ideal level to go short should we retest this area and post a failure candle.

Hi Foggy,  
  
I'm not trying to be a PIA. But when you do all of your notations on your charts and change time frames do all of your notes disappear? If not then I may have something on my charts other than the Demark TD indicator that is erasing my trendlines and notes.

Hi Foggy,  
  
Seems to be my night to ask DAH questions. When you say 5 and 7.0 your talking about the ATR and the factor fields??? Just wanted to make sure because I have BAT indicator from several years ago.

Dont worry Dave you are not a PIA, I am on to it and I will let you know what can be done as soon as I know. You are right with the BAT settings. Just play around with them, check back a few years and see how best the setting should be, after that the market will respect them. For me it basically gives me an idea of who is in control, the bulls or the bears. Then after I look for opportunities with thrust bars and DeMark.

Hello Amit,  
  
Sorry I don't quite understand your questions. What system is my code writen for, do you mean what trading platform? If so it is Metatrader. What does the TDST cost for tradestation? Not sure about that but this indicator is free for anyone who wants to use it and can be found on the first post of this thread.  
  
Hope this helps, if not please try to explain again.  
  
Cheers

USDCAD - Stopped  
  
This was a quick one, I will now wait to see the reaction at the 1.0587 level and should we get a bounce there I will go long again.  
  
I just took profits on my trade from Friday but not intentionally, the multi trader takes a bit of getting used to and I forgot to uncheck my first trade when setting the stoploss on the entry from today so the first entry got the same stoploss and was closed for a profit in pips of 119. Hopefully I won't be kicking myself over this mistake later, but forex being forex I likely will. Anyway, it has gone now so I will patiently wait for another opportunity.

Hi Amit,  
  
Sorry still not sure what you want, what is TS? Am i missing something or just completely dumb. I have no coding experience so you will need to explain in english. Do you want the code for the TD_Count file I have in the first post?

AUDUSD  
  
Looking at both the daily and weekly charts it is clear that the bulls are still in control here and following the weekly outside bar formation a few weeks ago the bears have failed to take advantage and remove any important levels. While this remains the case I see no reason to join this market on either side. Looking from a daily perspective I would need to see the bears test the 0.8893 lower BAT support and from a weekly perspective I would need to see the bulls test the 0.9790 TDST resistance on the weekly chart before becoming involved.

EURGBP - No Change  
  
_Been calling for selling opportunities since we removed the bear trigger level of 0.9037 on the 4th of December without success thus far. I will continue looking for chances to go short until we get closer to the TDST support level of 0.8901 at which point I will wait to see how it develops. As you can see from the daily chart, the bears have plenty of barriers in front of them if they are to reach the 0.8475 bear target and as we are still under control of the bears on the weekly chart I will watch the reaction of the TDST support levels to enter long in this market.  
_ _  
To sum up, I am still bearish and still looking for opportunities to go short but I am wary of the bullish factors to this market and will be fully prepared to take longs should the opportunity present its self at lower levels._  
  
We got a retest and failure of the bear trigger today at 0.9037, however the price came within 4 pips of the main TDST resistance level so there was no DeMark entry today.

EURJPY - No Change  
  
_I was hoping that the bulls could push this market up to the last bullish thrusts low at 132.49 to initiate short positions. However, they failed and have posted quite a bearish candle on the daily chart on Friday. While tempted to look for shorts on the back of that I am happy to sit on the sidelines here and view GBPJPY at better levels to sell Yen strength.  
  
To sum up, although I am on the sidelines here I will start looking for selling opportunities should we move towards the 131/32 area.  
  
_No Change here, still waiting for a move higher to look for selling opportunities

EURUSD - No Change  
  
_I really love how this pair is setting up and depending on the outcome over the next few sessions I see the possibility of opportunities in either direction. As you can see from the chart below we actually came within 6 pips of the TDST support level on Friday. I had a little photoshop fun with this chart and added an ideal scenario. If we can hit the lower BAT support and close back above the TDST support level while at the same time complete the 9th bar of a TD Buy Setup it will be an ideal opportunity to look for buying opportunities. However, should we close below the TDST support level and remove the BAT support I would still expect to see a retracement higher but should we reach the 9th bars low at 1.4842 this would present the ideal selling opportunity.  
  
_No change here although on a lighter note, todays candle is very similar to the ideal scenario candle I posted last night, spooky ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f633.png?v=15.1)... Let's hope the rest of the scenario plays out and we get some good opportunities _.

GBPCHF - No Change  
  
_A complete mirror of the EURGBP analysis, I was hoping to go long after removing the bull trigger of 1.6697 to a close. I will continue to look for opportunities to buy until we get closer to the TDST resistance level of 1.7000. In addition, while we remain under the control of the bears on the weekly chart I will be ready to switch a legions and go long should we get a good failure of any of the TDST resistance levels above.  
  
To sum up, I will still be looking for long opportunities in this market until we test the TDST resistance level of 1.7000 at which point I will move to the sidelines and watch how things develop with the view of selling upon failure._   
  
No change here, in similar fashion to EURGBP we did retest the bull trigger here at 1.6697 (actual low 1.6698) but got no signals on the DeMark front. I will continue to look for opportunities.

GBPJPY - No Change  
  
Unlike EURJPY, GBPJPY actually posted a bullish thrust on Friday however I am still happy to look for opportunities to sell this market after the bulls failed on a retest of the last bullish thrusts low at 145.40. I was short at higher level but was removed during the bear squeeze but still see plenty of downside potential at current levels.  
  
However, should the bulls remove the 60 day SMA I will take a step back and watch how thing develop.  
  
No change here, we didn't have any chance to go short today so I will continue to wait patiently.

GBPUSD - No Change  
  
_As expected the MA's are providing the resistance here since they were removed them to a close last Tuesday. In a similar fashion to the EURUSD I would prefer to see if the bears can test the lower BAT support at 1.5988 before becoming involved while it may also be possible that we complete a TD Buy Setup at or around the lower BAT level which would be ideal. Should the bears test this level I will look for long opportunities initially as we remain under the control of the bulls on the weekly chart._  
  
A good run for the bulls today but I see nothing yet to change my view here while the MA's hold and the last bearish thrusts high at 1.6475 is not removed to a close the bulls have a lot of work to do.

USDCAD - No Change  
  
_Well, since breaching the upper BAT resistance level some weeks ago I have been looking for opportunities to go long. Following the removal to a close of several bearish thrusts highs followed by a failure the bulls seem to be struggling a little. However, I have managed to get one long position on Friday and I will be looking to add to that this week should the opportunity arise. With a double TDST resistance level appearing at 1.0851 I will take partial profits there and be ready to go short should we fail this level on the daily close while I will hold the rest of my position for the ultimate bull target at 1.1250._  
  
Complete balls up today on this pair, took a long trade and as I trade multiple accounts I went to adjust the stoploss on the new entry forgot to uncheck my old entry and its stoploss was placed at the same level as todays trade which was then stopped. So I got out with 119 pip profit but I had planned to hold it for longer. Never mind, a profit is a profit. People forget that we are only human and mistakes can be made, emotions can be used from time to time but so long as you finish each year in profit then who cares.

GBPJPY  
  
Sorry I have been quite busy this morning but we got quite a nice failure signal on this pair some 40 mins ago. I took a short position and was stopped, the risk was 44 pips which is quite high for DeMark but certainly not for GBPJPY. Anyway as I was so busy I had to prioritise and could only enter this one on the multi terminal and not the demo account.

GBPCHF  
  
As I just explained in the last post I have been busy and like the GBPJPY I only had time to enter this one on my live accounts. We got a bounce from the TDST support level so a long entry was taken. As I didn't have time to enter this one on the demo, I attached a screenshot of the MM and the 2% target is at 1.6876.

Hello Dave,  
  
I got my guy to look at the code and when you take away the erase function you can see what happens from the pictures below. I knew there was a reason we needed to have it. Anyway, I am sure you would rather have a separate chart or re draw your own lines and text rather than have to delete all the crap that gets left on the chart from changing TF's from the DeMark indicator.

Yes nice entry, EURUSD is testing the TDST support on the daily chart currently so a bounce today would offer a nice buying opportunity.  
  
While I appreciate your postings Mr Taiko, it would be good if you could elaborate a little more and if you trade the TD Setups, post pre entry and explain to the other users how and why you enter?  
  
Thanks, much appreciated...

EURUSD  
  
EURUSD has pushed through the TDST support level of 1.4577 and has the lower BAT support level of 1.4497 in its sights. We are currently on the 8th bar of a TD Buy Setup so as I posted two nights ago, should we remove the lower BAT support level today or tomorrow, we should see a good bounce higher. In an ideal world I would like to see that happen today with a close back above the TDST support of 1.4577, that would be superb.  
  
Having to use demo data here but failry sure the numbers are the same, there or there abouts anyway...

Hi Foggy..  
  
Thanks for looking into that. Makes sense that you would want each fime frames TD count separated from the other TF's count.

Here is my first trade using the TD indicator and the info from this thread. Like every one else I was watching the EU and it seemed like it was heading toward weakness on daily and 4hr so I was looking for short positions. On 5 min TF price fell under the green support line and then came back up and tested the support line twice. This looked like a clear rejection to me but I was concerned with all of those recent failed attempts to take price lower. So I decided to wait until those lows were broken before entering. Waited until 1.4600 to enter (also break of previous days low) and then exited at 1.4534 at the consolidation area that formed on the chart.

Dave,   
  
I loved reading your last post. I wish I could see more posts like that to help me with my trading. I know if i can figure out what the great traders are thinking when they trade, I know I can mimic it. You had a plan on your trade, not just making a blind buy, sell, or run like hell. This is where I am trying to get to with my manual trading.   
  
Good luck and happy pips!

Thanks Dave,  
  
I got it sorted, well I am actually having to use the demo data feed and enter with the mulit-terminal, still isn't fixed. My broker has changed to a state of the art new computer centre so I guess they are having some teething problems but I am sure it will be for the best in the long run.  
  
Nice entry, today although you will have to be careful using DeMark in that way as there are a lot of false signals (I guess like my way and all trading systems...lol...) Na but seriously I have looked into this way before and it is dificult to trade. However, one thing I can tell you through my research and testing of this particular method is that if you get a close over a TDST level and price comes back watch the 9th bars high if you close above a TDST resistance level and a 9th bars low if you close below a TDST support level. These are the levels that are usually key following a close over the TDST level.  
  
Obviously though you used it to go along with your long-term view which is fine but I guess you wouldn't usually adopt this method.  
  
Cheers

Hi Foggy...  
  
Just trying to get my head around all of this. Here is a picture of the GBPUSD 5 M chart. Price has come up and closed about a TDS resistance level. Now do you wait for a re-test of that level before you go long or are you just looking at the resistance level for a rejection and a short signal and there's no trade if it breaks and goes higher?

Hi Dave,  
  
Hope the picture below helps explain what I was meaning. Your buy level would be the high of the 9th bar in the TD Buy Setup. I think if I remember correctly this particular strategy works better on higher timeframes however obviously the risk will increase but I would say there are too many false signals on lower timeframes.  
  
At the end of the day Dave any of the ways you chose to trade will give false signals like everything but I believe if you can chose the right direction from looking at a higher timeframe as you obviously can then you will pick the right trades and the indicator can then be utilised in a number of different ways.

Hi Foggy,  
  
Yes, I realise that any methodology will give some false signals no matter how good of a trader you are. I have read some of Demarks stuff and I just find it a bit confusing. Even though I find Demark's writing a bit confusing I find your TD indicator quite useful especially for locating areas of support and resistance. The GBPUSD trade I posted was just support and resistance and it was a really nice set up. From your example I see what you mean about the 9th candle and I will take a closer look to see if trading those breaks looks profitable to me.  
  
I do have a question, on the TD indicator there is a fine dotted line that seems to move up and down with price and it frequently changes colour from green to red but I can't figure out exactly what triggers it to move or how you would use it to trade with.

Hi Inbox,  
  
If you notice in my postings I never talk about any indicators other than the TD and BAT. I don't talk about them because they have nothing to do with this thread. So I would rather not post my indicators and templates out of respect for the originator of this thread. Believe me, the indicators on my chart will not help you trade with this methodology on a 5 min chart. Learn price action and support & resistance and you'll be able to trade any TF chart. Follow Foggies analysis and learn form him, he does a really good job of analysing the longer term charts and candle formations.

Hey Dave,  
  
Yes, if you read Jason Pearls book about DeMark, although very good, you will be even more confused. There are loads of different types of DeMark methods and they take a lot to get used to although so far I just trade the TDST support/resistance levels. However, I am looking into another way of trading the TD setups using my thrust method and at first glance it looks really good, but the stoploss might be a bit higher as it works better on higher timeframes like 30 minute and higher, I will post once I do some more testing over the festive period.  
  
To answer your question about the line that changes colour and disapears. Right, the rule of DeMarks TD Setups is that each bar must close lower or higher than four bars earlier until we get nine in a row of the same direction and that is your TD Setup. The reason the line keeps changing colour and disapearing is because it is a possible TDST level. It might be green because the current bar is about to close higher than four bars before it. Then it will disapear because the candle comes below the close of four bars at which point it might change to red because it might now close below the close of four bars before and therefore be a possible TD Buy setup instead. So this can change all the time on the price action of each individual bar. Watch carefully at a current setup and look where the close of four bars ago is, then watch when the price suddenly goes over there the whole count will disapear. Think you will get it now.

Thanks Dave for the respect, although I wouldn't have been offended in any way but you are right it would be good to keep the thread clean as there are a million different ways we could try to alter and add things when it is best people just try it out, see what the likes of yourself and I am doing and maybe adapt it to their own methods.  
  
Thanks also for the praise on my longer-term analysis, I was begining to wonder if anyone was actually getting anything out of it and whether it was worth continuing the postings.

To give the readers of my thread a little taster of what I am currently looking at I have taken a snapshot of the current USDJPY 4 hour chart and jotted down a few notes. Stoploss, risk and exits are not decided yet but I will either look to enter using the same method I do on the 5 minute chart or zoom in and hunt for opportunities on a smaller timeframe assuming it also goes along with my longer-term analysis.

Just a quick post to update my analysis as I have been otherwise engaged tonight so haven't found the time to do my full analysis but will post some charts and stuff tomorrow morning.  
  
I am still actively trading EURGBP (Sell), GBPCHF (Buy), GBPJPY (Sell) and USDCAD (Buy). However, I will be adding EURUSD to that tomorrow (Buy) as we will be on the 9th bar of a TD Buy Setup and hopefully we will breach the BAT tomorrow at 1.4497 as we came within 5 pips of doing so today.

Hi Foggy,  
  
On the 4hr UJ chart. You have a 9 count sell set up. The smallish candles that occur right after the 9th candles close don't trigger the short because the smallish doji type candles don't close below the bullish thrust candle, is that correct? Ok...moving higher we get several bullish thrust candles and then some bearish reversal candles. Which of those 2 cadles that I have marked would you enter short on?

After the sell setup I am looking for a bearish thrust, so as you can see this doesn't occur until 13 bars on your chart and 12 on mine if I remember correctly. Our data is slightly different so the entries wouldn't be the same but basically we get the same result. Regardless of what else is going on the entry rule is simply, after a sell setup go short on the close of the first bearish thrust bar and after a buy setup go long on the close of the first bullish thrust whenever they appear. On your picture though I would take the second candle you have marked because on your chart it is the first bearish thrust.

As you will know I posted my GBPCHF long entry from yesterday at 1.6834 but didn't have time to enter it on the demo account. Anyway I did the calculations manually on my trade management file and it shows that GBPCHF has now hit the would be 5% target for a complete 7% profit. So far this week there have been 2 trades, one loser with GBPJPY and the winner explained above so thats a nett 5% profit so far for the week.

Remaining on the sidelines here although we are very close to the lower BAT support level of 0.8893. Should we breach this level I will start to look for opportunities to go long on a short-term basis with the view of selling once we remove a bullish thrust to the close.

Interesting developments seen today in EURGBP and GBPCHF as both pairs test their respective TDST support and resistance levels on the daily chart. There are two possible outcomes here which should provide plenty of opportunities into the new year.  
  
EURGBP  
  

Attached Image

![](/attachment/image/380258?d=1260971406)

  
  
With EURGBP we are currently testing the 0.8901 TDST support level on the daily chart. Should this level be removed to a close this will confirm the bearish scenario and I will keep looking to add short positions right up to the ninth bars low of the TD Sell Setup. However, should we get a bounce here this tells me that the bulls are fighting back and while we remain bullish on the weekly chart I would view this as significant and I would start to look for opportunities to go long with an initial target of the ninth bars low at 0.9065.

With GBPCHF we are currently testing TDST resistance at 1.7000 on the daily chart. Should this level be removed to a close tonight this will confirm the bullish scenario and I will keep looking to add to my long position all the way down to the ninth bars high at 1.6622. However, should we get a bounce from this level this will alert me to the fact that the bears might be ready for a fight back in which case I will look to take short positions with a target of 1.6622 initially but will hold my long incase this doesn't play out as a free trade.

With both pairs still above their trend breakout points things are still far from decided but I will be prepared for either scenario.

EURUSD  
  
Currently on the ninth bar of a TD Buy Setup I have taken the decision to look for buying opportunities at this point with a view of a move to the 1.4966 level initially. Following the removal of the TDST support level to a close yesterday this market has turned bearish on the daily timeframe as far as DeMark is concerned. I had hoped we would take out the lower bat level of 1.4497 to give further confirmation of this bearish scenario before we completed the 9 count buy setup however this is still a possibility. To sum up, while I am looking for longs I wouldn't really expect to get any signals until the lower BAT has been removed but with the TD buy setup completing today we can't rule out a rally from here which would then leave the lower BAT intact and retain the bullish outlook from a BAT perspective.

Hi Foggy,  
  
I know that these trades my not be text book Demark trades but I am finding the indicator and your explanations very helpful.  
  
Ok we have sell set up (Red 2). Price gets rejected @ 1.6308 and is rejected by the resistance level of the previous buy set up. I've marked the high of the 9th candle of the sell set up (red 2) @ 1.6319. Price gets to 1.6319 and gets rejected from that area. Price comes down and goes below the 1.6308 level and that is my entry. Out at 1.6275 for 33 pips. Any feedback would be appreciated.

No problem Dave,  
  
If you find a way to use the indicator then post and other people might find using it that way suits how they trade. Although remember, the down trend red nine counts are TD Buy Setups and the up trend green nine counts are TD Sell Setups.  
  
Another nice trade though, good stuff!

AUDUSD  
  
Since posting a bearish weekly outside bar several weeks ago the bears have made good progress here and have now taken out the daily BAT support at 0.8893. I will now wait until we get a bullish thrust bar at which point I will look for opportunities to go long in the short-term with the view to sell once we then close below the low of a bullish thrust.

EURGBP  
  
This pair is now developing into a classic bear BAT move and will now target the 0.8475 level initially. The bears have removed the TDST support at 0.8901 to a close which only goes to strengthen their position in this market. At this point I would rather sit on the sidelines and wait for further developments with a view of selling at a higher level. Although this level may well be out of reach I see the 0.9065/69 area as a big barrier for the bulls and would look to sell rallies to that level. In the mean time, should we make any bullish thrusts and fail to get up to the 0.9065/69 level I will look to sell the removal of the would be bullish thrusts to a close.

EURJPY  
  
Since the bear squeeze move and resulting removal of the final bullish thrusts low around the 132 level I was hoping to see a move back up to test these levels with the view of adding shorts. However, the chance of seeing this level anytime soon appears to be fading. We did however make a bullish thrust candle on Monday and I now see the removal of this candles low at 129.61 as confirmation that the bears are ready to make another assault on the 126.88 level initially. Therefore, I will remain on the sidelines with a view of looking for selling opportunities should this low be removed to the close tonight.

The other chart I have attached is the 5 minute chart from yesterday. So far I can't seem to pick out the correct direction on this pair and really good setups keep appearing when I am on the sidelines. This one is particularly good, with only 14 pips risk followed by a 200 pip move.

EURUSD  
  
We have seen some significant moves by the bears over the past few sessions with the removal of the TDST support level to a close followed by the removal of the lower BAT support. Things are not looking good for the Euro bull at the moment and currently I can see the bears testing the 1.3900 level initially into 2010 following a pull back and quite possibly the 1.3120 level later. I had planned to look for buying opportunities following the nine count buy setup which was completed yesterday however, with the removal of the lower BAT support now I would prefer to see a bullish thrust bar before following this particular strategy as the risk remains to the downside until the bulls can force a temporary bottom signalled by a bullish thrust. On the chart below I have added my ideal scenario at this point, I would like to see the bears test the 1.4302 TDST support level and see the bulls fight back and place a short-term bottom. Should this scenario play out I would then look for opportunities to go long with a view of selling once a bullish thrust bars low is removed to a close.  
  
To sum up, I am on the sidelines until we either get a bullish thrust around current levels or we test the TDST support of 1.4302. I see no reason to get involved on the bear side of this market at current levels.

GBPCHF  
  
Although I have been looking to go long for the last couple of weeks and the bulls remain in control so far as my BAT analysis is concerned I can't ignore the current price action around the TDST resistance. As you can see on the chart below, the last time we tested a TDST resistance level was way back in August and this produced a failure and substancial bear move. Taking this into consideration, I will take any chances to go short at current levels until the TDST level is removed to a close. On the bull side of this market I will hold my long position for the 1.7723 target and look to add to that should we remove the TDST level to a close.

I was looking for selling opportunities as we approached the bullish thrusts low at 145.41 with no success. As we have now bounced off the 60 day SMA again and we sit right around the lows of of two bullish thrusts I would prefer to stand aside and await the removal of the 145.23 and 41 levels to a close with a view of looking for selling opportunities. I don't currently see any reason to get involved in the bull side of this market.

Following the removal of the MA levels to a close the bears took temporary control of this pair. However, while the bulls remained in control on the daily and weekly timeframe I prefered to sit on the sidelines and await further developments. At this point I will remian on the sidelines until either the bears can remove the lower BAT support at 1.5988 or the bulls can remove a bearish thrusts high to a close.

Since the bulls removed the daily BAT resistance some weeks ago this pair has been bullish on the daily timeframe. After a bit of a struggle it looks like the bulls are gaining some traction here however as we are moving ever closer to the daily TDST resistance level I would rather wait to see how this pair develops around this level with a view of taking shorts on a failure followed by longs after a pull back.

Currently the bears are in control on both the weekly and daily timeframes, however, the bulls have taken significant steps by removing the TDST resistance and the 9 bars low to a close. At this point I see no reason to get involved on either side and I would like to see the bulls remove the upper BAT resistance level at 91.44 before I become involved.

Once again nice trade by Mr Taiko, however I am sure everyone would like an explaination on how he trades these setups. So far we have only seen good trades from you and I can see two trades in the picture which would have been losers I am assuming, although I don't know what your rules are, please share them with us Mr Taiko. The thread is not for boasting about good trades you make but to help people understand how to trade DeMark, preferably before it happens or at the time of the setup as I have done.  
  
Your contribution would be most appreciated,  
  
Cheers

fxtaiko, please explain why or what criteria you are using to enter the trades as it seems your entry do not have anything to do with the thread originator's rules

Excellent work, how good is that, your wife also likes to trade. I think that is actually a good thing as you can take turns to keep an eye on what is happening when the other is busy, lucky guy ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)  
  
Ok, thanks for the explaination. It is similar to the idea's I have and I am looking into starting a new thread in the new year focusing on trading TD setups along with my own idea's.  
  
Keep up the good work and we can show everyone how good DeMark can be as a trading method.  
  
Cheers

Thanks Dave,  
  
I find doing the daily analysis very enjoyable and helps keep me on my toes with regards to always taking a longer-term look at the markets and finding certain levels that need to be tested or removed before I become involved.  
  
Nothing much to report today, I am waiting on bullish daily thrusts on AUDUSD and EURUSD, a lower BAT breach for GBPUSD, Will look for TD Sell Setups (New Strategy) followed by bearish thrusts on the 30 minute, 1 hour or 4 hour chart on GBPCHF and USDJPY as it approaches the 91.44 BAT resistance level. Other than that there is nothing doing so I will leave the next batch of analysis for the weekend.  
  
Cheers

Hi Foggy Trader,  
thanks for posting - looks good, I will to try to backtest your system,  
I have created several system based on demark indicators - and found that its extremely hard to find fully automatic system that will be profitable all the time  
in particular I used TDST to enter to trade after completition of TDSEtup  
\- i also used TDMoving average on day period to identify long term market move and filter signals  
anyway it was very profitable along 2008 with small loss downsides but had almost zero profit during 2009.  
demark suggest to trade TDST levels using its 3 break out qualifiers(the same as for tdlines) - i tried that and found its not good enough   
probably bounce tactic will be more profitable as in trending markets TDSetup often loose even having close TDST support/resistance

Hi Foggy...  
  
Here is my EU short trade for Monday. First off I have the Daily chart and we've just broken through and closed below the BAT support line. So On Monday I'm expecting that we'll get some sort of pullback and we did. Although we did get a small pullback I still think there may be more room to the upside this week for a stronger pullback on Tuesday or Wednesday. Also on Monday we reached the lowest low of Friday and this low is the lowest point since Sept 2009. I'd be cautious taking any longer term trades south until we clear that low.  
  
OK, with all of that said on Monday we did get a pullback and I was watching the 15m chart. We had a TD Sell set up and the candles kept going higher after the 9 count stopped. So I thought I'd wait for a bearish thrust bar before even thinking of getting in short. We get the first bearish thrust bar and I'm not sure I believe we're going to turn around at this point. I'm thinking we still need to go a bit further north with this retracement. So we get a lower high and then another thrust bar and I jump in short at 1.4343 since we have a lower high/thrust bar combination. Took this one down to 1.4314 when it started to retrace and I thought it might turn around and continue north at this point. So got out with +29 pips and of course looking at the chart in hind site I missed out on a trade that would have netted +100 pips. Despite the price movement in the down direction I still think that we may get a retrace north this week before resuming the downward march. Again, just how I see the market right now. If we break Fridays and Mondays lows we may go down to the 1.4170 mark without a major retrace. Either way I'm ready for which ever way the market decides to go.

Here is my take on the EJ daily chart. We've been in a range for about 8 months. It's a big range but it's still a ranging market. We've broken the BAT support line to the downside twice now creating a double bottom which typically means a move north. What might happen is price will move north until it reaches the downward (red) Trend Line and when it gets close to the TL price my get rejected and the down trend will continue. Confirmation of the down trend would certainly be a break and close below the double bottom formation. Remember this is a daily chart so this won't happen over night, It could take a week or more, especially with Xmas in a few days.

Hi Ozziedave,  
  
cant agree with such entry though it was profitable as there is no really TDST bounce so it just gone through tdst resistance and after some time went down  
  
there was another instance of bullish bounce that fit to foggy trader strategy

Hello Ivan,  
  
Thank you for your post and my apologies for taking so long to answer you. Similar to yourself I found trading the TDST bounces to be more profitable in 08' than 09' but we can attribute that to the large moves that were witnessed. I do still believe it is a good way of trading and have made a small profit since I began the thread however I have also felt that my sound daily analysis is going to waste waiting on a TDST failure/bounce. Therefore I plan to start a new thread in the coming days which will involve trading TD Setups and TDST failures according to my new rules which I have been analysing for some weeks now. The thread will be similar to this one, I will do my daily analysis and inform everyone what I am looking for on each pair and before a setup develops (where possible) I will post a picture and explainations during all stages of the trade. I believe trading TD Setups this way will present us with more opportunity and better reward while I will still take TDST bounces/failure if the direction suits.   
  
I have no intentions to become involved in the markets during the Christmas period so there will be no analysis until the new year at which point it will appear on the new thread.  
  
Cheers

Hi Foggy,  
I performed some testing over year EURUSD tick data  
without noticeable success.  
Tried to trade 5 min intervals bounces and got total loss  
though I need to optimize some aspects of system. Some points i noticed :  
1) take profit objective is taken for :  
a) resistance bounce - tp is low of buy setup that creates that resistance  
b) support bounce - tp is high of sell setup that creates that support  
am not sure about that s really good objectives , for example when you   
trade setup then usual tp objectives are taken from fib levels of setup range, usually it's just 0.5 of setup range  
for bounce I am not sure if it would have full setup range as tp objective  
2) demark usually suggest to have SL on close basis - so if price closes lower/higher support/resistance for buy/sell then stop loss trigger, but this tactic is not good because after TDST break out market usually speed up so loss increased  
3) sometime price fail many times in a row TDST support/resistance - so probably it's worth not to trade such "hesitating" price  
4) I tried to filter signals by demark 180 min moving average as well probably it's worth to use another oscillator to measure bull/bear power   
  
  
later probably i ll put some statistics here as I tested system from the scratch and did not do some important measurements/optimisations  
  
I m keen to test 15/30 min interval as it seems to me quite good described by demark technics as well as S&p index  
  
  
  
happy new year!

Sorry and thanks for bringing this up, here is the mql file, I have removed the expiry. Just open with metaeditor and compile.  
  
My broker has changed to an extra decimal place so the red count numbers have moved too close to the top of the bars so I have changed it a little, if anyone needs to change it back you need to adjust the "**int gi_108 = 12"** part at the begining of the code. So change the number 12 until it suits your broker. If any coder out there knows how to change it so both the green and red numbers can be moved I would appreciate the help. Also, if any coder out there would like to volunteer to help make some changes to the file please come forward I don't have a clue about coding but would like to make a few adjustments to the TD file.  
  
I will also change the file on the first post, sorry for any inconvenience.

Thanks Foggy. It is now working. A couple of questions if I may..  
  
1\. What do the long red/green dashed lines represent on the charts when they appear? They seem to refer to a support or resistance but I am not sure which.  
  
2\. Also what is you definition of a bearish or bullish thrust bar?  
  
Thanks again and you have done a great service by explaining this part of Demark simply.

Hello DJ,  
  
Thanks for the compliment, I try my best to make it as clear as possible. Just to let everyone know, I didn't get the time over the festive period to prepare the new thread but should have it up and running sometime this week and I will provide a full explaination of what I regard the best way to trade DeMark.  
  
To answer your first question, the long red and green lines you see on the chart are potential TDST lines. Should the TD setup be complete the long line will become shorter after 12 bars where it will be established as a TDST support or resistance level. These bars can appear and dissapear depending on the potential close of the current bar.  
  
To answer your second question, my definition of a thrust bar is when we get a close below the low of the last bar (bearish thrust) or a close above the previous bars high (bullish thrust).  
  
Thrust bars are a big part of my new trading method and I will provide full illustrations of all aspects involved in the new thread.  
  
Cheers

Hi Foggytrader.   
  
Do you know why my Demark numbers are a mess? I was hoping the numbers would be close to the candlesticks?  
  
Any help is greatly appreciated. Thank you.

Hello Neil,  
  
Yeh, sorry about that, my broker recently changed to an extra decimal point so I made changes to the file to suit that so if your broker still uses four decimal points it will look like that.  
  
Here is the mql file, open it in metaeditor and near the top change the number 12 to a lower number until it suits.  
  
**"int gi_108 = 12;"**  
  
Cheers

Hi guys,  
  
Would like to ask, does it lags? I was looking at 5-15 minutes to test the indicator and found out it has some lagging issues.  
  
How do you guys confirm the trade when the signal shows up and then disappears?  
  
Thanks!

Hello TK,  
  
I have never experienced a lag with the indicator. The rules of the TD Setup are that the bar must close lower (Buy Setup) or higher (Sell Setup) than the close of four bars earlier. Let's say we are in the middle of a TD Sell setup, we reach bar 6 and the price goes lower than the close of bar 2 the count will disappear, if the price comes back up above the close it will reappear again.  
  
This is the only thing I can think of but for sure it is not a lagging indicator for sure.  
  
Hope this helps,  
  
Cheers

Just to let everyone know if they hadn't worked it out already, I will be doing all my posts on the DeMark TDF thread from now, which will from time to time include TDST trades.

Hello Alnader,  
  
The indicator you are refering to is actually part of the TD_Count code and there is no separate indicator. If you would like to only use the MM part of the TD_Count file just set the data to true and the show TD to false and you will only get the MM part of the file.  
  
Cheers

Was a big fan of Tom DeMark, especially his price projection strategy which was one of the reasons I started loving price action trading. Well, I still remain his thankful fan to this day. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f64f.png?v=15.1)
