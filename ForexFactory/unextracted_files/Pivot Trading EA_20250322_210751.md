Important notes:  
  
1\. We updated the [rAlgo Pivot EA SuperCharged EA](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jDH-h7y2j7o2iDvPDAHc9qxdKJIWJXKl?usp=sharing) to v1.1 on 8 Feb 2022! you can get the latest [version here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jDH-h7y2j7o2iDvPDAHc9qxdKJIWJXKl?usp=sharing) (please read the two **README files** before you start).  
  
2\. Please [join our Telegram group](http://bit.ly/ralgo-entry) so you can get the most out of this EA through our community chat group.  
  
3\. You should stop using v0.84 of the EA, please upgrade to v1.1 as it contains many bug fixes.  
  
\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
Good day to you, earnest traders, thank you for dropping by this thread!  
  

  
As you know there are both advantages and disadvantages of Manual vs. Automated trading systems, so I am not going to elaborate further. Davit's system is a manual one. You can find Davit's thread at <https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=588764> \-- If you don't know anything about Pivot Trading, please read Davit's thread and learn the basics from there.  
  
As mentioned, **rAlgo Pivot EA** was developed in April 2018, the first release was v0.5, the latest version is **v0.8.4** (Mar 2019), from the version number you can see that from the version number, rAlgo Pivot EA is still in **beta** stage, as I am still testing and fine-tuning the algorithms. Even though it's still in beta development, the trading results reported by many of our FF members in this thread shows that **the EA is already generating profits** , this is very encouraging to us all, still you should trade at your own risk and discretion.  
  
To get organized,**I have teamed up with WindChaser** to grow this project together, I will focus on EA development while [WindChaser](https://t.me/WindChaser1) will help manage this thread, look after administrative tasks (feedback/feature requests/bug reporting etc), general support and liaison matters. Thank you WindChaser for your contribution!  
(Tidbit: WindChaser and I are both IT Professionals, he is based in Singapore while I am based in Jakarta)  
  
I invite you to not just read through the thread, but actively contribute your comments/ideas/bugs/results so we can improve the **rAlgo Pivot EA**.  
  
_WARNING! Read this carefully:_  
1\. I am the creator of **rAlgo Pivot EA** , the EA is **FREE** but it's NOT open-source.  
2\. I added EA protection to prevent unethical traders from selling the **rAlgo Pivot EA** , so I collecting account information via MT4 WebRequests. If I found someone selling my EA or doing something that causes damage to me or other people, I will shut down the EA for that account.  
3\. If you are not comfortable with Point #2, you should stop using **rAlgo Pivot EA** immediately.  
  
**_rPT-EA Releases (and instructions on how to setup the rAlgo Pivot EA included in the links below):_**  
20180607: v0.51 released.  
20180711: v0.6 released with improvements.  
20180718: v0.7 released.  
20190121: v0.8.1 released.  
20190305: v0.84 released.  
20211226: v1.0 released.  
20220208: [v1.1](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jDH-h7y2j7o2iDvPDAHc9qxdKJIWJXKl?usp=sharing)! Please [join our Telegram group](http://bit.ly/2W5rHcV) to start.  
  
_**FAQ:**_  
1\. Why did you start this thread?  
To give back, and the good FF community can come together to build an awesome EA.  
  
2\. What are the best pairs to trade, best TimeFrame and the best set files?  
For now you can forward test the rAlgo Pivot EA on major pairs (on demo or CENT accounts), so far the best TF is **H1** , use the default settings for now.  
  
3\. Can I backtest the EA?  
Yes you can!  
  
4\. Backtesting is pointless and useless, and I suspect the results you shared are fake.  
We do not want to debate on whether backtesting is useful or useless, you can decide. And sure, we understand you should not trust everything you read online, so the advice is for you to download the EA and put it on a DEMO account to forward test it. You be the judge.  
  
5\. Why the EA does not seem to work with my US brokerage account which requires FIFO trading?  
The rAlgo Pivot EA is not compliant with US FIFO trading, so we cannot guarantee if it works/not work, you will have to figure it out. We have other pressing priorities and do not have plans to achieve FIFO compliance in the near term.  
  
6\. How can I get more support or contribute to this project?  
a. You can continue to post comments/idea/bugs/results here in this thread  
b. You can join the **[Telegram](http://bit.ly/2W5rHcV)** group to chat with other like-minded traders who are also testing the rAlgo Pivot EA  
c. You can email **[support@ralgo-ea.com](mailto:rAlgo.EA@gmail.com)** to reach both [WindChaser](https://t.me/WindChaser1) and I  
  
Green pips to all,  
akangaziz & WindChaser

NZDCHF at R61. I know it's too risky here. but let see the final result later. I don't know if I need additional entry filter or not if a big bull candle is come-up exactly before the SELL signal appears.

the original idea of creating this EA is to build EA that can be running at any broker and holding the position in less then 1 day.

Nice system. FYI putting files into sinsin executable file may put users off from downloading. Most people are suspicious of executables. It's not difficult to install manually. You'll probably get more downloads... Just my two cents.

If you will keep that TE up and running open will be great.only like this the potential or no potential (some bad orders) on the way can be seen.and if ... IF that EA will blow up the account you can always start new TE named as next new try with new improvements added in the code.  
having all old TE's up visible even all wiped accounts or bad DD (if they will be) can show clear EA performance with every new improvement step.and so you and of course others can see clear how EA gain potential with every new addition from first TE test to the last one updated.  
cheers! 

Take what you can, give nothing back

EURAUD earn 100 pips this morning.   
and continue to open another trades since the signal is still valid. do I need to limit the trades to only 1 signal per pivot line? currently, EA (expert advisor) will open trades in the same pivot if all required condition is met. ok, let see..

i think you can make that option customizable,from 1 to.... how much orders user want.I see good thing to split one bigger lot in more little ones and trigger when conditions meet.  
for example my margin allow me to risk 0.1 lot on every pair.so i will choose 10 orders of 0.01 (add to trade/build up positions)to be triggered when condition meet for that pair. or not and i just set one single 0.1 lot at level condtion,entry tp and bye bye.wait for next.

you know mt4 backtester is really useless right? ohh you dont cos you just requested that. the best thing to test real market conditions (closed to real market condition) is demo testing with market open. backtest = 0  
i hope you dont let EA's run on your account based on mt4 backtester useless results ...

AUDCAD backtest from 2017 until April this year. default setting, initial deposit is 1000 USD, lot 0.01.  
  
I need to upgrade my vps storage to get full 5 or 10 years backtesting data.  
right now I only use 300 GB storage vps with 12 GB ram in <https://contabo.com/?show=vps>, spent 9 EUR for vps + 6 EUR for windows license every month.  
  
my backtesting tools are:   
1\. Tickstory (1 time pay for the license)  
2\. contabo VPS (monthly subscription).

it's very possible, but my vps doesn't have sufficient storage.  
  
if you subscribe vps from <https://contabo.com/?show=vps> (the highest storage), I can use your vps for backtesting.

hmmmm no more intersting, sorry  
  
backtesting with 3 pips of spread over a 10 years period is enough to see if it works or not.

I agree, but he uses fundamentals as well,and that is a difficult one to know. I personally like your EA, and I have a question. say you have one trade triggered, like today long on GA. when do does the EA go the other way - only after the trade is closed?

it was opened at S78 and closed in the area between S78 and S61 with 100 pips earned! still possible to go for S78, but as mama said, market is unpredictable. stay safe. for me, 100 pips are enough.

Hi, good caught! the fundamental part (news filter) is my homework for this EA. it's on my list for next feature after the entry & exit rule is firmed.  
if EA open a trade let say at S78 like in GA today, EA will not open another trade with different position. EA will always support existing trade by adding volume after x pips is reached. the default setting is every 5 pips, EA will add another volume.

Akangazia,  
I worked out from your trading report that your win ratio is 75%, and your profit/loss factor is 1.73 to 1. Very good.

Maybe it's just a coincidence. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
basically, it's 75% win ratio from statistic view, but it's 100% win ratio from EA view ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1). because in each pair, EA will handle all opened position as a single order and added more volume every 5 pips distance (adjustable from setting), once trade reached 100 pips profit, EA will close all position for that pair.

Hi akangaziz,  
I just discover Davit thread a few days ago... and I was already thinking about implementing an EA, because I love the idea behind (supdem + fibo).  
  
Do you plan to share the source code, I would love to contribute to improvements and/or testing. Unless I should start from scratch my own implementation (using an existing framework...) :-(  
  
I kwow there are plenty of calendar avaliable to retreive news, but I already made my own several year ago, I can help on the news filter and probably on many other features...  
  
Regards,

I take this as a bug. somehow EA open trade at the main pivot line, not at support & resistance area. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)

Akangaziz,  
I definitly do not have same pivot and fibo levels across several pairs, what broker are you using?  
Would you mind sharing/posting indicators and template?

If u ask me why only need to take 100 pips? maybe this chart can answer that question.  
100 pips at H4 timeframe is a safe cumulative pips target.

I am sure fundamentals have not changed last 10yrs! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60b.png?v=15.1)Many brexits,Greek crises,Russian invasion of Crimea,Syria,Iraq and sanctions/unsanctions on Iran etc  
  
10yr data is useless.  
  
In my opinion real trading is discretionary.EA can't factor lot of things. Demo results are not the same as real when you got real hard earned cash at stake.Not saying can't be done but my system is more then pivot levels.  
Good luck and furthermore I am always surprised guys looking for shortcuts... Guys like Strat,CNtrader,Mr Pip,Scott some top traders don't use EA's.There is a reason why.  
regards 

In trading, you have to be defensive and aggressive at the same time

i like the way you do it.is VERY early yes but even so you must consider that just posting pips screenshots with the plan to make people here to beg you and full your PM with requests,and to get undercover deals and ...who knows maybe tricks,doesnt look good at all.you will not be the first one then with a very short journey here.  
my friendly advice is to not share the code working or not EA,why? because scammers are watching and you may have surprise to see it for sell under diff name on diff place.  
second , make clear your intention and dont let people who have questions with their questions ... in the air.so they will be forced to go in pm for all kind of deals.that kind of behaviour will lead you ,you know in what zone.  
overall? is simple,be transparent,be honest.YES you may want put a price on your work ,**fully agree**.but till then dont ruin your thread with suspense.  
best regards. 

Take what you can, give nothing back

you can check the detail from my trade explorer or my mql5 link.  
  
one important think about testing on demo account is highly possible to have similar performance with real account with some condition:  
1\. backtest is 100% same with the real result (no matter demo or real account)  
2\. it's not trade in second, hard for the demo account to catch-up with the real account if trading is scalping in second like news trading, arbitrage, etc.  
  
what I'm going to say is:  
1\. u develop ur main system in demo account for forward testing.  
2\. once entry & exit logic is firmed, and backtest is exactly the same with forward testing. then u can start with real account.  
3\. be optimistic, but keep smart. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

You could trade with EA'S but you would need more than one, one for range one for trend, and so on. there is no way it can think like a human brain.  
  
if it could it Goldman's would have it.

He said "I will share asap, the problem is I need to merge the indicator, template & EA itself into 1 single executable files. so you can pick it easier and install in your vps/computer with the easiest way. I plan to release this EA for free in this forum around this month."

I know that you look at the fundamentals, I remember your old posts  
  
but I'm sure that the technicals alone work in the long term, why not keeping an open mind ?  
  
I too have always been skeptical about non-trend following systems.

You were removed because you asked simple questions that was clearly explained in the first page/post. Trading pivots is an advanced trading technique that requires experience.  
  
As far as your ea, it appears you are relying more on TDI crosses then valid SR pivot levels. That has little to do with Davits system.  
  
Anyways, best of luck on your endeavor. 

Trade with confidence, trade without fear.

Hi akangaziz,  
  
First, very good job with the coding trade logic in your expert advisor. CONGRATULATIONS! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f4aa.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
The technical strategy is not new and has been around for 20 years. many Experts Advisors are available online, some free and some are commercial products. There are similar trading strategies based on the use of the various different versions of Pivots and the derived S&R levels.   
Example link below is one that use the Standard Weekly Pivot and trade the reversal at define levels R1 and S1 for example and averaging down.  
This one uses the JMO indicator which is an oscillator. Others use Stochastics, MACD, etc. as secondary filter to pick the reversals.  
  
[https://www.forexstrategiesresources...rading-system/](https://www.forexstrategiesresources.com/pivot-forex-strategies/22-levels-reversal-trading-system/)  
  
With your coding skills, I am sure you can make variations without the use of the TDI.  
  
I am sure many traders would be interested to diversify their trading and trade with an EA in addition to their usual manual trading.  
  
Good luck! 

Honesty is a very expensive gift. You wont find it in cheap people.WBuffett

IMO this kind of system performs well in ranging markets, I would not use it in the long term, just for fun.  
  
problem is you need $1k to start, so you need a cent acc

@akangaziz good work and keep it up. could you please help me with setting up my pivots, mine seems to be off the mark. I could not ask this in Davits thread on fear of being thrown out. my broker time zone is GMT-4.

"Trading pivots is an _advanced_ trading technique that requires experience." - What you said is Horse Shit ! Why don't you and DavIT followers learn from this thread and put your floating losses available to your readers? Complete bunch of swines hiding behind fancy looking 'partial' balance curves and not showing your floating losses. Your idiot pivot guru banned me also by saying a 100% fact [here](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=11051898#post11051898) that no one had the balls to deny.  
  
My suggestion to OP - focus on ROMAD of atleasr 2+ and you will do just fine. Ignore all the idiots including the biggest idiot who is burning in hell seeing what you were able to do in few months.... but be transparent and true with your intentions as Husky77 raised in post 81. Nothing wrong with not sharing EA with others... I know I would never do that myself. Apart from that, kudos was putting a TE and hopefully putting DavIT out of business of chit chatting and his followers liking his idiotic "paid mortgage with my profits" type performance posts.  
  
Good Luck bro. I am sure more idiots will see this post and throw shit on me but no worries, I handled them all via their nasty PMs and I can handle them here and elsewhere. Facts are Facts and no one has yet to deny or challenge what I posted in that thread !

And to all the pivotfactory idiots who are blinded by their Guru's "performance" and dreaming of paying their mortgage from FX Profits... this guy's account is ONLY 7 days old and he has already made 44% in just 7 days... not some shitty 10% monthly target like DavIT. I can do 100% every week on a $1000 account size with 400:1 leverage. Last month, I did 1200% in realized profits but that means shit if you are running a hidden floating loss of 70% without anyone knowing about it.  
  
To all the DavIT followers coming here in search for Holy Grail - DEMAND transparency from your Guru or quit following him ! You will thank me one day when most of your realized profits will be wiped clean by floating losses. You WILL ask yourselves... What the F*CK just happened to my account which was in profit for sooooo long! All your hard work of staring at floating loss thru weekends will go up in flames.

Here's my lesson of the day for pivot traders... if you do desire to add to losers, add it in a responsible manner by reading and **_understanding_** [this](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=11096405#post11096405) post and ask yourself how is VEEFX adding positions at reduced risk every time.... the more positions I add, the risk is ACTUALLY going down via diversification across many pairs and timeframes.... because the position size is also going down... because the used margin is going up ... because the available margin is going down....  
  
THERE is just no way possible to plan this in advance like DavIT does.. by looking at the calendar of events and shit like that. One idiot will fart and move the market 100 pips and then you all can ask "where can I see the fart on my ForexFactory calendar? I am calling you guys idiots for your own good because there will ALWAYS be a idiot trader within us doing stupid shit fooling us, trying to convince us... believe me.... this happens to everyone.... those who have emotionally responded to my posts openly and via PM will never succeed unless they realize and capture and train the idiot in you.  
  
Go back to school and understand how a leverage account works. how margin is depleted by every "planned in advance" addition to your floating losers. I repeat... trading this way manually is a complete disaster waiting to happen. trading this way across multiple pairs is a absolutely certainly for blown accounts. It will happen SOO fast, you all (especially noobs!) will be left holding your arse in your hands staring at the screen thinking "what should I do next?" "Where the f*ck did DavIT disappear when I need his emotional and feel-good support to feed my wife and kids" etc etc.  
I AM ON YOUR SIDE !

David's winning formula - When any pair crossed up or down from those so called crucial pivot lines just hit the buy or sell as though there is no tomorrow. And there you have it, hundred of pips. Post those that won and dump those failure.

I will not say this davit pivot way is such an advanced scheme as rules are very clear and kinda basic.with a bit more experience than basic you can get it on manual.during my watch on charts i see not always all those levels are respected for reversal.i am a PA trader and if my charts show me one currency or one pair get strength right on 61 or 100 then i go easy against any rule anyone can claim on any thread,and thats because i trade my wayand works for me.  
davit pivots is not bad at all as you have enough chances to spot one good entry place,if you get in DD then add to trade...mmm ok.  
to conclude i think even if manual is not such complex i do belive will be a bit harder to automate this,but i will watch here just cos i am very curios.  
you guys must cheer up here ,i see some got booted out from davit thread very easy,not a reason to get angry at all.come back to your senses cos if youre a trader and you get angry very easy for such reason then i dont want to know how you react when you get slap in the face with serious DD from the market.calm calm calm and try to not give a f...k for non serious matters.in the end ... everyone is right in his own way.  
and most important let's let this thread clean as this guy who started have a plan,let's respect him a bit more and watch what he will achieve.

Seriously VEEFX, I first came across you just a couple of weeks ago and looked at where you traded from "Vatican City" ... looking for divine intervention were you? ... now its "Monaco" and since then I have read you say "I'm outta here" or "head back in my cove" or similar at least 17 times ... on Davits thread, on Copernicus thread and more see, [Post 3932](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=11118865#post11118865) as an example and that was in May.  
Mate, that is 17 times you have changed your mind in just a few weeks on just ONE decision ... how can it be possible that a "self -proclaimed extraordinary trader" can change your mind so often and still claim to be be successful and here you are yet again?  
Suggestion, please ... take it or leave it ... make a decision and stick with it ... leave for good ... the probability of 100% satisfaction is guaranteed ... from people here and for yourself. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f602.png?v=15.1)  
PS ... I have seen your published results with your magical systems that you delete after 24 hours because it is a "secret" and well ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f602.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f602.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f602.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f602.png?v=15.1) ... yea mate, IMO time for back to the cave for more study .... or maybe permanently, but you wont be able to do it ... you will be back here ... you need to be here ... it is your drug ... you should seek help as you have serious issues ... just some friendly advice ... good luck! 

When you are successful perhaps give a thought to others ... Kiva dot org

Why he keeps talking is a mystery to me.

Maybe a case of ignorance is bliss ... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f602.png?v=15.1) ... maybe everyone should just ignore him because I think his "mind" just thrives on the attention and that is why he keeps coming back ... maybe he thinks he is Arnold Schwarzenegger (I'll be back) ... he sure is an actor ... note I did not say performer ... but don't think VEEFX changing his mind so often would bring California back from the brink of bankruptcy ... guess we will have to wait for the next gems from the cave ... or NOT ... hopefully.  
Anyway ... Davit's discretionary system works ... there is plenty of independent proof ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

When you are successful perhaps give a thought to others ... Kiva dot org

Hi guys,  
  
I'm back. what a busy day.  
  
Pls stop blaming & fighting each other. u need focus to your trading, put ur energy into ur work, ur masterpiece.   
I have no problem with any single user in FF here.   
  
  
ok back to trading. so today, as u see in my trade explorer, we have a floating pips because of some pair open new cycle in the wrong pivot line. I already mentioned this bug yesterday, but still no time to fix it. I will update the EA this week (not sure which day ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1))  
  
fyi, today we got only 4-5 cycles from several pairs. equal to 400-500 pips profit!

this is floating trades from EURJPY. root cause: wrong logic, it's opened trade in main pivot line.

imho, there's some room for EJ to reach R38 & R61. If failed to break R38/R61, it will fall.

Today DD as of now is 20% of the account..wow...that is an issue with this technique....DD that's never talked or shown on davit's thread.  
  
VeeFX is mostly erratic but correct in the main points that he makes.

To all the idiots@pivotfactory (except OP who I have high respect as I mentioned in my first post here),  
  
\- None of you have responded to the facts that I am raising!  
\- None of you have acknowledged the facts I have raised about this trading style  
-None of you even understand what I said in my post that got me blocked  
-None of you have discussed or agreed or disagreed with me why it is important to ignore balance curves when you have trades open that are either in profit or loss  
\- ALL of you are only focussed on me and my style, my arrogance, my performance blah blah  
\- Those who have interacted with me all came with personal attacks. Not one of you have investigated math or had a sane conversation about the issue I am raising for your own awareness and for the awareness of those who follow this strategy.  
\- OP is actually doing a great service by putting his TE. I bow to him with respect. You all will finally learnt from this thread what you will never learn from someone who has 1000s upon 1000s of posts and no evidence of any long term success. Just filtered balance curve performance charts.  
\- Crypto, the link on my shoutout to PipEasy thread states where I live in America. Bring your focus away from me and to the topic at hand. You will learn a thing or two from me and my recent posts. I am here only because of shitty strategies like these that have facilitated into repeat blown accounts. Look at my recent posts and you will know for how long I have been a blown account to stable to Breakeven to profitable phases. Read about my journey that I have openly shared through out this SwampFactory and stick to the facts I am raising.  
  
OP- as I said, please continue to be transparent. Such a strategy should never be traded manually. I wish you success and hope this EA sheds the light on **equity** curve drops and not just straight upward going balance curves. I am very confident, at the end, you will be net positive if you have robust controls on "return over MaxDD" by getting out of losing trades while you are still ahead and don't wait for too long until they catch up with your balance curve. Good Luck bro. Keep an eye on equity curve and use balance curve only for guidance if you know what I mean.  
  
Since I am now blocked from the second thread on Factory (which uses the same strategy from the first thread that I was blocked from), I have deleted all my posts from this thread to reduce clutter. Keeping this post as a _**VeeFX: Permanant Reminder**_ to all those who are hell bent on embracing failure in the future. Time will tell.  
  
OP- I hope you will keep the TE running as evidence! If TE stops or removed prior to significant drawdown (> 50%), it will only support everything I have said in this thread. You as a thread owner has a responsibility to enlighten all the followers beling misled by DavIT's fake performance screenshots in his thread. I wish you nothing but success with this EA and apologize for the distraction. I mean well for those who can understand my intensions. 

Staying in my lane...

It took me about 2.5 years to become consistently profitable. Here you are 12 years + and still getting run over.

Davits system doesn't regard the R38 level as an ideal trade zone.

These are basically swing failure/mean reversion plays on the outer SR zones. Just be aware that price can smashes thru the 100 and keep going.

Cryptocurrency is a different domain with more predictable returns. Unless you buy and sell Bitcoin. The block-chains are difficult but anyone can exploit it with predictable results.

Hi D,  
  
do not be irritable. Most people on FF are a specific species. They are waiting for the Messiah who will come and give them holy grall. The Messiah gave HG and the chimps are screaming, stupid because they did not get the HG they are waiting for. These people are waiting for HG for idiots. HG for idiots should work like this. Press the green pop out banana. Press the red pop out alcohol.

Since you seem to use pivots, care to weigh in on the pro's and cons of using them?

deltaone seems to be utilizing pivots successfully. Look at previous post.

Umm, I think you were the one dismissing the use of pivots. Even tho they are used, and have been used for decades by successful traders.  
  
I want to hear deltaones views on them as he seems utilize them as well.

now that nyse has closed, i´ll respond:  
  
firstly, i use them for years with good outcome on average. you can take a look at one of my early posts in "carpe diem".  
secondly, i know they are used in indices intraday-trading by insti traders.  
thirdly, there are many crosses of daily pivots, not everyone is a winner. you need to add other criterias in order to be successful. plus prudent use of sl/tp for every single trade. but adding to losers is just increasing risk. this comes close to martingaling which will lead to heavy losses in the long run - this is a statistical well known fact.  
  
i never said something against using pivots, feel free to show me one single post of mine within my thousands of live trade calls - how could i? this would be hypocritical.

BS my friend, you have a clear history of being a FF thread "hit and run" artist.   
  
You demand others to provide proof to you, as you fancy yourself as some kind "expert."  
  
An expert you are clearly not.

Apologies to OP  
Have a suggestion for you VEEFX ... I am happy to debate anything BUT I will not do it here or on any other thread unless it is YOUR thread.  
I note that for all the time you have been of FF you post on other people's threads, your Profile does not show any threads unless you have made a request to have them closed ... possible but doubt it.  
So instead of disrupting every other thread, start your own ... obviously call it whatever you like ... and then present your idea there as per any normal thread starter would and then allow others to visit for constructive comment/debate.  
I am not interested in disrupting this or any other thread any further regarding your comments and unlike yourself when I say I wont, I don't ... further if you refuse to open your own thread for discussion then that just proves 100% that one of your major motives is attention seeking and to disrupt other people's threads ... Sad but True ... Indisputable FACT! 

When you are successful perhaps give a thought to others ... Kiva dot org

Known Bugs:  
1\. sometimes if u use more than 4 or 5 pair and you forgot to set different magic number for each pair, usually you will find R & S line is double. to handle this just simply remove EA from the chart and drag it again manually.

Thanks for sharing... i've loaded it on 6 charts.... Just few question..  
could you share your pivot indi with the same setting coded inside EA?   
Seems backtest is not possibile right?  
Is this timeframe related or it's possibile use different tf ?  
  
Thanks  
Best regards

you don't need pivot indi. I merge it into EA file.  
the only indi u need is TDI as provided in the zip file.

You say that a pivot indi is not needed as it is i9ncluded, due to pivots varying quite a bit >20 pips in recent times are the included pivots the same as  
[https://www.actionforex.com/markets/...-pivot-points/](https://www.actionforex.com/markets/pivot-points/fibonacci-pivot-points/) ?  
and how does the EA react to levels outside the SR100?

you can retry drag EA manually into your chart.  
imho, it should be your connection problem.

I didn't check for other mt4 broker. so far in [tickmill](/brokers/tickmill "View Tickmill Broker Profile") works well. and pivots is quite similar to your link above.  
10-20 pips different is acceptable for me, because pivot is a range, not an exact value.

sounds like a concept for desaster. it proves by fact how risky it is to add to losers: a drawdown of -25% in a single day. no sane professional would let this ea run with real money - but maybe davit ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1) even the op warns not to use it in real. if you want real fun, take the money and go to the casino.

The pivot lines are not being drawn for certain pairs. It seems to favor the GBP pairs when drawing pivots on chart. Could just be a bug. Let me know and keep up the good work. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

yes, the indicator calculates from all bar for the selected pair. it only slow in the beginning, once successfully loaded, the rest should be fine.  
I take a note for that. thanks.

Hi guys, I received some PM ask me to help to trade using this EA in their real account. some of them offer me to manage 10k account. this is crazy & lazy!  
let me share you a few things about this ea:  
  
1\. this ea is still in early testing. what we need to check is about the entry & exit.   
2\. once entry & exit is valid & firmed, then we should check how the EA react with the very strong trend without reversal after break R100 or S100. this is the big challenge.  
3\. once step 1 & 2 is passed, I will open EA for backtesting. right now, I disable the backtest. because I'm sure a lot of lazy users here will shoot me with an unnecessary question based on backtest result.  
  
happy forward testing!

this is good question. in v0.51, I reduce the aggressivity. EA will only take a look from previous closed bar (shift 1 in technical explanation) to validate the trade signal.  
let's test this method for the next 1 week. If the result is not ok we can take it back to normal level, but more aggressive.  
  
til now, in v0.51 I prefer to not over trading.

Hey, just wanted to tell you that you are doing a good job. I have studied Davit's method for awhile....and the biggest perril is exactly what you have   
identified - strong trend without reversal. That is the killer of this technique and many traders accounts have died on that.   
  
Perhaps SL can be next Pivot level, after all partial positions are filled. So, as an example if 38, 61, 78 are filled , 100 is SL

I would definitely NOT use 38 as one of your first levels used. I would use 61, 78, and 100. Then if all of those levels are used THEN use the 138 level as your SL. But what you would have to do also is measure your pip distance from 61 to 138 and use that in your calculation for your Lot Size according to what Risk% you want to use.

I don't think put SL at any level can solve the strong trend issue. even 138, 161, or 200 it will not help. ur account already die before floating trades reaches level 161, unless you add ur ammunition (adding new balance). I've tested this setting at version v0.3 and I found that this method is not effective, It will only add drawdown level to your account.  
  
We need something that can tell us the strong trend will continue before it reaches SL. any idea how to do this?

CHFJPY. even the trend is BULLISH. but the EA still can make a profit in resistance area (with open position SELL).  
If you see the chart, EA wins the rally because everytime the market will create another bullish, the market will fall first before continuing the trend. this kind of market movement is very safe for EA.  
  
as a result: 4 cycles win. equal with 400 pips!

> {quote} I don't think put SL at any level can solve the strong trend issue. even 138, 161, or 200 it will not help. ur account already die before floating trades reaches level 161, unless you add ur ammunition (adding new balance). I've tested this setting at version v0.3 and I found that this method is not effective, It will only add drawdown level to your account. We need something that can tell us the strong trend will continue before it reaches SL. any idea how to do this?

if you can create a setting that will allow you to choose what Risk % you want to use according to your SL. THen you can control how much you lose when you do hit your SL at 138. I have not yet tried your EA so I don't know how you coded your MM in your EA......but if it was an input that can be changed by the user than we can decide before hand how much we want to risk for each trade. Then if you did use a SL which was predetermined by the Pips from 61 to 138....you would lose no more than what you have chose your risk% to be. You of course would also have to determine how many "small trades" to break down your "overall trade" into. This would be similar to how Davit trades with using smaller lot sizes and adds them as he goes. The overall loss would still be only 1% or 2% risk.....what ever you determine it to be before hand.

Read it again, is the same as before and my question remains unanswered ...  
there is no setting above 100 in the EA inputs so if there is a trend above say 161 with no setting in the EA to cover this how does the EA handle this?

Refer Post 189, in my opinion you need to fix this and make the connection for your feedback SECURE for the security and protection of all who use your EA.  
You are using an insecure connection for data which is easily hacked.

i don't know where all this people hate towards davit come from  
  
it´s not like he´s forcing u to use his method, if it didn´t work for you, just move on.  
  
davit is not selling u anything, he´s just sharing his knowledge for FREE.  
  
all these guys saying davit is manipulating his results are clearly jealous of his success,   
  
please instead of criticizing someone who's doing really well, work on yourselves!

Oh, that question. for now, EA doesn't have the option to enable trade in level > 100\. I don't know if it's a good thing to add level > 100 to EA ?

Hi, it's another thing. different with the topic we talk before. for that setting (max risk) is already available in ea setting.  
we can't rely on max floating trades (refer to max risk setting), because it's too late to exit the trades if floating trades already reach this default value (which is 80% risk. but yes, it's adjustable).

Hi, it's to check who and how people use my EA. since I don't recommend for real account testing, so I can monitor it from my server.

Hi akangaziz  
  
Whilst I respect your sharing of your EA and your honesty to this point, I think you're on a slippery slope my friend. Unless I'm mistaken, and I'd love to be proved wrong, you are obviously collecting more data than just the EA version.  
  
Your post here ( [https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...3#post11143093](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=11143093#post11143093) ) says "**I'm watching you!** " and the screenshot (below) shows you are collecting info including account number, account name, real/demo, account balance etc etc.  
  
As I said, I'm hoping I'm wrong so maybe you could explain this mate?  
  
Cheers

the EA that I shared here is without expiration. technically, can be used both for the demo or real account. But as I suggested from the beginning, we still in testing phase.   
  
and to prevent a lot of scammers in forex forum like FF (or any other forum), I added protection to the EA. If I found someone here selling my EA or doing something that make any damage to me or to other people, I can easily shut down EA for that account without notice.

Unless I'm mistaken, and I'd love to be proved wrong, you are obviously collecting more data than just the EA version. Your post here ( [https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...3#post11143093](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=11143093#post11143093) ) says "I'm watching you!" and the screenshot (below) shows you are collecting info including account number, account name, real/demo, account balance etc etc. As I said, I'm hoping I'm wrong so maybe...

definitely Yes, I collecting the account information for monitoring purposes. since this EA is free, and u use it with ur own risk. I deserve to watch EA performance from all account.  
  
this "watching" part also protecting my EA from any bad website or the bad guy who selling other people's EA.

Thanks mate, I don't have a problem with you protecting your work through that and I'm sure nobody else would either.  
  
But I think you need to be honest with people about this as your last statement said you were only collecting EA version number **which was not true**. Some people may not be happy that you have their name, account number, broker, account balance etc

Make sure you use fake name and a secondary email when you sign up for demo account.

just my 2 cents.  
1\. account equity should be still the discretion of a trader, demo or live, up to him if want to disclose it with someone. the least should have a warning about privacy.  
2\. point one can be easily circumvent with a copier to another account. wont hold back someone selling rogue signals based on it. 

there is always, always another trade!!

I've tested this setting at version v0.3 and I found that this method is not effective, It will only add drawdown level to your account. We need something that can tell us the strong trend will continue before it reaches SL. any idea how to do this?

Someone is back testing Davits method, and has worked out the probability of higher levels being hit. Anyway, why don't you test either with hedging or adding bigger positions at higher Pivot levels, because the probability of reversal goes up at tbise., and then close the bigger positions at the next level down (I mean lower Pivot level) in profit, and the positions from the lower levels at break even.

I think we all should ask you to turn off the "I'm watching you mode". After all the help and suggestion you will get from this thread and members it's not possible to be shut down and get EA not working from you. You should also post the MQL4.

Hey  
  
Collecting such data without proper permissions is against the law, just saying.

Very nice EA. Davit strategy is one of the best on this forum and you did a great job. I was wondering if you can share the 0.50 version so I can test it on a cent demo account. Thank you again sir

Does your EA have no SL ?  
If so, how do you manage the risk ?  
I am afraid of this EA will ended with a margin call.

Its not how it works. It is against the law even if you state that you collect data. You just cant collect data without some kind of permissions from the goverment i guess. Its not about me liking it or not, i dont care about your ea at all. I just dont want you to get into big trouble dude. (English is not my native language)

Very fair of [akangaziz](https://www.forexfactory.com/akangaziz) to allow his EA to be used and I congratulate him.  
The way I see this protection of his EA and access to private information is reasonably simple.  
akangaziz wants to protect his property from illegal exploitation - reasonable.  
Users want to be able to test the EA without fear of exploitation of the private/personal information - reasonable.  
The suggestion I have which is used by many, many coders here on FF and elsewhere is to issue a personal license for each copy. The coder gets the name and email address of the user etc and the user is protected.  
The issue I have with .dll access is that, will all respect for akangaziz I do not him personally nor do I know what he intends to do with the information.  
If someone steals his EA and then tries to sell it and akangaziz is aware, he will shutdown the EA - that disrupts all the honest testers and brings anything they are doing to a stop - unfair - the whole group is being punished because of the actions of one - unfair.  
My suggestion - issue a personal licence for each EA - give the coder full control and can stop anyone taking the EA and reselling and also give all honest users access to testing and use in real & demo.  
My suggestion ... 

When you are successful perhaps give a thought to others ... Kiva dot org

If you are going to shutdown your thread because of a "suggestion" there is little anyone can do ...  
seems like an over-reaction to a simple suggestion, however that is your decision and if it is your final decision I wish you all the best for the future and thanks for sharing what you did because without sharing thoughts and ideas this FF community would be nothing.  
Cheers

May I know how can you decide the stoploss and takeprofit point?  
As you mentioned, "every time EA reach 5 pips profit, EA will add 1 more position with the same lot with the initial trade"  
Are the 5 pips profit calculated for all opening position?  
  
Btw, nice EA. Thanks for your sharing.

All those who are testing it, are you getting the pivot lines on all charts? I put it ontothree charts, and only one has the pivot lines showing. A bit of a mystery, ha?

Hi Akangziz,  
  
Thank you for your effort coding the Pivot Trading EA. I would like to help forward testing it.  
I am running the v0.51 EA since this morning, on a HotForex demo $100K account, with default settings but 0.1 lot size on 28 pairs + XAUUSD.   
Will share the results in a week.  
  
Terima Kasih,

Windchaser, can you please tell me how you put it on 28 pairs - ie. did you just make up any umber for the magic number on each pair?

Hi Shimmering, I didn't change the Magic number, I will tell you if the EA could close trades with the same Magic Number in a day or two, as right now I have AUDNZD, NZDCHF trades running, all having the same Magic Number. Earlier on today the EA closed the GBPCHF batch (a total of 7 trades) as it reached the 100 pip-profit.  
  
Hi Aziz, I believe this EA has a lot of potential, I hope you reconsider keeping the thread alive and let's work together to improving the EA. While I have been on FF barely 6 months, I have seen/read enough forum threads to understand that while some people here are trolls/cynical/scammers, many of them are genuine too. Perhaps some do not write nicely since English is not their first language, hence the misunderstanding at times. I appreciate your effort and your willingness to share your EA with us, I think Davit is watching this thread too, so definitely you are making a difference.

I placed the EA on three pairs, and did chnage the magic number. But I am puzzled why the pivot lines appear on ly on G/U.

Hi Aziz- Is it possible to have the ea flexible so that the user can determine the pivot levels that it takes trades on? For example, you could have a pair that is strongly trending one up and retraces due to a data release. Perhaps the setting for the EA will allow a long entry at the weekly pivot point? Maybe there is an option for trading a certain pair in only one direction? A "long only" and "short only" box? Also, maybe there is an option to enter a trade only when the ADR is nearly completed? Something like a "trade only when 75% ADR achieved"? Thanks for the EA here, you could be on to something really amazing.  
  
I am attaching a chart posted by another user in Davit's thread (I asked users permission before copying image to post here). This shows the number of times each pair hit various s/r pivot levels last week. I thought fairly interesting:

I will consider the idea of "ADR" and will take a look.  
the rest question is self-answered if you already try the EA.

Using the pair ADR is a good idea.  
  
I use ADR-100 days and for every entry position it can be a fraction of the pair's ADR.  
Example, instead of 5 pips, use 0.05 ADR and this will also be good to trade high volatile pair like GBPNZD,...  
If the ADr 100 days is 161 pips, then 0.05ADr would be ~8pips per position distance.  
Your TP can also be based on ADR, say 1.0 ADR for 10 open positions and taking the average entry price os all 10 open positions.

Hello Boss,  
  
do you know why I'm getting the pivot lines only in some pairs?

Dear J1mm,  
  
This happens when you load from template without changing the magic number I believe or something of that sort. You can try to load the template and add the EA individually per chart. Remove it first if necessary and then all will be well.

Does this major number have any predictive power, I mean tries to exploit some market weakness. Or its' just random attempts to find best value?

What? The magic number you mean? This is an internal number EA uses to know what orders are his orders and what orders are the ones that you open.

first of all , thank you for sharing your EA and we all appreciated, but i have a question, how do you prevent about selling your EA by collecting our data? for example imagine I present your EA and results to someone , and he buy it. how do you know **I** sold it?  
  
also you said you are deserved to know the performance of EA by seeing results from data that captured , so my question is,is it free for ever ?

it's like telling the location of safety deposit box key to the bank robber. lol.  
I will not talk about this topic again, if u decide to use the EA, it means u accept it as is. if u still asking another similar question, please find another thread.

Hi Akangaziz,  
Whe you said TDI must >= 60 or TDI must <= 40, wich index from TDI-RT-Clone are you refering to (value3, Trade Signal or RSI Signal)?

akangaziz I can fully understand that you want to protect your work, but this collection of a persons data is quite unusual.  
  
If you want to protect your EA from resale, why not release a version with an expiry period instead?  
  
You can set a 30 day expiry period into the EA, and post an update each month, this way people cant resell, and members will keep coming back and you wont need to collect their data. 

Truth is like poetry. And most people f*cking hate poetry.

somehow I see v0.50 can give us good pips. I consider keeping the aggressivity from v0.5. Will include this as an option (can be activated) in EA setting.

v0.5 aggressive but still at acceptable DD. pls note that 6% DD is because of bugs in v0.5 (open trade in main pivot line, already fixed it in v0.51, but I reduce the aggressivity in v0.51. no worry, I will take it back to the new version - v0.52)  
  
  
result so far for 14 days: 70% profit, 8000 pips, 811 trades.

Great to hear. Maybe you can explore MQLLock option to protect your EA. That should help with the privacy issue regarding collection of personal data.

So, you will combine the v.050 with 0.51 and fix all the bugs into v52, am I right ?  
There will be great then..  
And another questions.  
Does your EA have no SL ?  
If so, how do you manage the risk ?  
I am afraid of this EA will ended with a margin call.  
What pairs do you recommend to trade with ?  
  
Regards.

How about adding an input for "profit in percentage to close all trades" instead of profit in pips? I would think that most people have a target percent per day or per week in mind when trading instead of how many pips they can make. Increasing your bankroll according to % is what counts most.

> v0.5 aggressive but still at acceptable DD. pls note that 6% DD is because of bugs in v0.5 (open trade in main pivot line, already fixed it in v0.51, but I reduce the aggressivity in v0.51. no worry, I will take it back to the new version - v0.52) result so far for 14 days: 70% profit, 8000 pips, 811 trades. {image} {image}

once this ea is forward tested enough we will find out what is an acceptable DD% is compared to the strike rate. With 70% in 2 weeks.....6% is NOTHING.

yes, for me. it's still not proven to handle big pips movement or very strong trend. from my backtest, it still needs attention in that part.  
  
but comparing with manual trading (which is involved psychology and patience), this EA already win strong.

If so, how do you manage the risk ? I am afraid of this EA will ended with a margin call. What pairs do you recommend to trade with ? Regards.
> 
> Ignored

each trade has its own SL level.  
I use SL at current pivot level + 100 % level +- 10 pips.  
  
ex:  
trade opened at R38, then SL price will be at R138 + 10 pips.  
or trade opened at S38, then SL price will be at S138 - 10 pips.  
  
I also added max risk that can be handled by EA. ex: if floating trades is reached 80% account balance, it will close all position. ---> this part need a better option.

Greetings,  
I believe the stop loss can be taken as the amount of money per pair  
As per DavIT we can target about $500 per trade/pair so something in that line we can think of stoploss instead of PIPS  
  
My 2 cents  
  
Thanks

Greetings,  
Closing all trades may not be a good idea as there could be some manual trades running as well which are probably for weeks or Months  
If closing all trades are required then they can be specific to trade opened by this EA only

no problem, EA will only manage its own trades. If you have a manual position, then EA will not count that trade as part of EA responsibility. your existing manual trade should be not touched by EA.   
  
but it all depends on magic number, pls note that all trades from MT4 client to MT4 server come with magic number. and please note that manual trade use magic number 0 (zero).  
so, please make sure each pair use a different magic number and never use 0 (zero) as ur magic number.

So if we set the inputs to allow the EA to start trading at level 61 and set my SL to R138 or S138.......what % level should I use?

SL level is managed by EA automatically. you can't manage the SL price, at least for the current version.  
If you enable level 61, then EA will open trade if the price in area pivot R61 or S61, and SL price will set at R161 or S161.

oh ok....sorry I thought that the SL level/% was adjustable. Thanks for your quick response! An adjustable SL might be a thought for future versions. Keep up the good work.

I have the ea running on 18 pairs for a couple of hours now. I have one entry on usdcad and several trades have opened up short UJ. The thing is, I have multiple executions at the same time/price. Screenshot attached. Is there some reason that this would be happening? I have only one chart open for each currency pair. I'm also suprised that it is selling UJ now because I thought that it would not open a short trade when there are green arrows, or a long trade when there are red arrows, but maybe I misunderstood. I am very excited about this ea thanks very much and if anyone has any suggestions on what I am doing wrong it would be greatly appreciated.

I have not changed to parameters that the ea came with other than lot size which I bumped up to .1 for 10k demo account. Here is screenshot:

Hi, I think your problem is because you have several or all pairs with the same **magic number** , you must place 1 different **magic number** for each chart.

Earlier on today the EA closed the GBPCHF batch (a total of 7 trades) as it reached the 100 pip-profit. Hi Aziz, I believe this EA has a lot of potential, I hope you reconsider keeping the thread alive and let's work together to improving the EA. While I have been on FF barely 6 months, I have seen/read enough forum threads...

Hi Shimmering, just to close the loop regarding your Magic Number question, the past two days I saw AUDNZD, EURJPY, GBPCHF, NZDCHF trades closed with the SAME Magic Number 8888 across all the 28+1Gold pairs, so I can surmise that it works even if you run the EA using the same Magic Number on different pairs. Currently GBPJPY, USDJPY, USDCAD trades running with 0.1 lot sizes.  
  
Hi Akangaziz, it seems there is a small bug in the lot size calculation on the first trade the v0.51 EA places, I set the EA's "started lot size" to 0.1 however for the very first trade on any particular pair the EA traded, it would always start with 0.01, then on the 2nd trade onward the lot size would then continue with 0.1 lot size. I believe it's a small bug. Lastly, it seems the performance by v0.50 is better than v0.51?  
  
Thanks,  
WindChaser 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

Hi Akangaziz, it seems there is a small bug in the lot size calculation on the first trade the v0.51 EA places, I set the EA's "started lot size" to 0.1 however for...

thanks for the report.  
EA will always start with initial lot 0.01 (not changeable). I prefer this because if the initial lot failed to reach 5 pips in less than 24 hours then EA will close the initial trade with a loss. I set this because if initial trade is failed, I can assume it's big possibility EA will have floating trades which is increase the risk & dd.  
  
if EA succeeds reach 5 pips, then the next volume will use the lot from EA setting.  
the only enhancement needed related with lot setup in v0.51 is the total calculation for 100 pips. because the initial lot is 0.01 and the next lot for that cycle use value from EA setting (let say 0.1), then the total of 100 pips would be not same with 100 pips * 10 point * 0.1 lot = 100 usd. because the pips from initial trade (0.01) will break the total profit for that cycle if after initial trade, EA reaches 5 pips or more, and then back to floating. it is happens yesterday in EURJPY, closed 100 pips profit but in total loss few usd. I mean, in pips is profit, but in total USD it is loss. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
that bug is fixed in v0.52, still backtesting. will release soon.  
  
thanks

EA will set it automatically. if pivot lines still not showed up, u can remove EA from chart and re-attach again.

will start 1000 USD in [tickmill](/brokers/tickmill "View Tickmill Broker Profile"). other broker should be fine too.  
default EA setting is works with 1000 usd balance. If u set lot to 0.1, you need to use 10k usd balance. unless u only attach EA in 2-3 pair.

with the default setting, balance 1000 usd, I think it's safe to use more than 10 pairs. thanks to Davit that his pivot lines can work well for all pairs. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Hi Akangaziz,  
  
I have tried your EA, put on 2 charts and the issues are: on AU doesn't show any pivot lines, on UC shows pivot line but wrong. It shows the S200 & S161 but the UC between PP & R38.

Just FYI, Davit recommends to stay away from pairs with large ADRs as a strong trend can kill you ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Did you enter the skycode URL? Also, after loading the template, remove the EA and drag it from the EA list onto the chart.

Hmmm, I see!  
  
I thought that even less would be fine, your actual drawdown was around 17% which should be around 170$ of DD and it was caused because an error as well? So maybe 0,01 could be traded with even less deposit and around 10 pairs with low Daily Range, don't you think?

also i think if let set your tp to 50  
  
and/or move the diference between trades to 10, it could trade with way less than 1000  
  
its just a question of Forward testing if the EA keeps with profits anyways  
  
it would have less flowating trades at least

Sounds interesting, probably will be just a matter of "playing without the parameters" problem is that we are only able to do that in forward testing... Maybe adjusting TP to lower value is not a good option if at the end a SL Hit will throw away 1 month of trading (I don't know if this may be the case) ... Quite risky but adjusting the amount of trades taken definetly will reduce the total lot size of an operation.  
  
I'm just trading a couple of days on Demo but its super interesting the way the EA is trading haha

but keep in mind that if you increase the trade distance to 10 pips and keep the tp at 100 the trade will need to travel more than twice as far to close the trade.?  
I didnt the math yet   
  
that can be even worst than keep a low profit tp set on a good trading system.  
  
well, nice ur having fun, the EA dont work for me, i dont know why, im just following the treath to see out it goes ^^

It's a bit weird, what I did is the following...  
  
1- Follow instructions on the EA Download thread (The other one appart of this)....  
2- When you chose the EA Template, remove the EA, save it  
3- Chose again the template without the EA and attach the EA manually, set magic number, I don't know, 123  
4- If you load a new pair, chose the Template without the EA and manually add again the EA, chose a different magic number, maybe 124  
5- Repeat  
  
Regarding what you say about the 100 pips... you are right, I was thinking about this after I answered your post... Will be just a matter of trial and error I would say...

i redo everthing.  
  
aparently i had a / at the end of link permition.  
  
then i change the distance of pivot to open a trade from 10 to 100. to see if it was a 5 digit broker problem.

Hello  
  
A little question. - I posted it in Davit thread, but no answer, so I make it here.  
  
Where can I change parameters for a proper actualisation of FF calendar? (there is [FF Cal News] in Davit template)  
  
It shows me obsolete data.  
  
thanks for your answer.

Hello, Dear AZIZ and friends.  
  
What do you think about placing trailing stop at version 0.52? and that this is activated from the profit that I want.  
  
Will version 0.52 be available to work on real account?  
  
You must be doing BT to each with version 0.52, when you throw it, could you please place the result of each pair with the benefits and the maximum DD?  
  
  
Thank you very much for all your friend Aziz, you are the FF Crack.  
  
Sorry my bad english, its google traslator.

I like the idea of a trailing stop. You could set it to the original 100 pips and let it run for more profits. Could potentially improve the R:R.

Depending of the color of the square, TDI/RSI is wayover sold, wayover bought, oversold, over bought, over sold, below or above fifty (mediam line) ...

Hi Akangaziz,  
So I used a framework I made on MT4, I implement your entries rules (with minor modifications) and indeed, it seems to have quit a lot of potential. What I like is the low DD% and the High SQN...  
  
  
  
See attached a report on one pair :

  1. GBPJPY -
  2. minimum lots,
  3. basket profit 100pips,
  4. from 01/01/2018 until now

Decompress all files in a temp directory and open the htm file. The gif file is the MT4 StrategyTester graph for the same strategy)  
  
The framework I made allow me to test at the same time, the same strategy on several pairs and then I can backtest options as :

  1. session profit (in $ or pips - for each pairs or for all pairs at the same time)
  2. basket profit (in $ or pips - for each pairs or for all pairs at the same time)

If I am not too lazy, I will upload historical data for major pairs and keep you inform about the results. If results are ok, I will probably start a forward test on my VPS.  
  
But my question is : Are you openning trades on new bar or on each tick?

I noticed it open order on each tick, not on a new candle.

Yeap, this is what I though also... This is probably to allow new trade each 5 pips if last order is in profit. Let Akangaziz comfirm.

Hello all, i've been follwing this thread and just yesterday i started running the EA on my vps. The EA looks promising but what i find absurd is the wide stop loss it uses. Can someone throw more light on this pls because the stop loss i see on my platform could be well over 100 pips

The EA is largely grabbing 100 pips profit per pair each day so your net gain will always be higher than net losses after one or two stop losses. Seems to be a well thought out package. We need trailing stops and news filters and all will be well.

For the record I had enabled martingale (multiplier 1.0). It's disabled by default.

But low drawdown for a 10k account you put it on a 1k account and its 50%, right?  
  
How does MT4 calculate the Drawdown? Is the maximum negative floating P&L?

This system would blow up like 1 time a decade if we turned it off during the news. Less profit but almost unprecedented reliability. This is due to the retracement patterns around pivots.

Same problem, here. Tons of FIFO errors - has to be screwing up the trades big time.

In my opinion, i still think the EA will do fine with just 100pips stop loss but presently the stop loss is about 400 pips

@[akangaziz ](https://www.forexfactory.com/akangaziz)， thanks a lot for your great work on this EA, I'm doing some test in two demo accounts, the result is amazing.  
  
one of the demo is STP, another is ECN, the result is quite different. They open orders on different positions, or one have orders, another no orders. do you know what 's the reason?   
  
Thanks again for your sharing this excellent EA.

A couple of suggestions. Would be nice if the EA had a setting which would allow you to use an arrow on a smaller timeframe as a trigger/confirmation for trade entry. For example, if you could use a green/up arrow on both the 15/30 min timeframe as a requirement in order for ea to buy on 240 chart. You'd lose a bit of the reversal, but still if you can catch a change on a 30 min chart that begins a reversal on the 240 then you would hit profit target.  
  
Also, with the martingale strategy, would be nice if instead of buying steadily on the way down it would only increase 1 time per fib support level. So, if for example system took an entry at s38, there would only be 3 more fills, one each at s61/s78/s100. I would just like to see some sort of damage control in the event that a long trend is beginning and the ea is trying to sell a currency that is strengthening accross 5 or 6 different pairs.  
  
I'm also a bit confused how the EA enters trades. I have the exp adv running on 24 pairs, including AC, AJ, AN, AU, EA, and GA, and yet the only pairs that it has opened trades on is AN overnight. It opened 13 long trades starting at 6/14 12am gmt. Adding new postions on the way down. Yet I have the settings the same on all pairs. Why did it only open trades on AN pair? Can anyone explain? And despite being on 4 hour timeframe, it added 7 positions in one 30 minute timeframe. I just don't understand why it put on so many trades while not a single other trade has opened in any other Aussie pair.  
  
I would like to also have an option for a time delay before the ea adds another position. Perhaps 12 hours or 24 hours?  
  
Happy Eid Aziz! Have a great holiday!

Does anybody have problem with MT4 crashing, once the ea is loaded?

My fxchoice account crashes when I load the template. It will not run with the template. No problems, however, with my [forex.com](/brokers/forexcom "View FOREX.com Broker Profile") account. Currently using 3gb memory and 5% CPU.

I guess the template is not necessary to the EA?

Just curious. Does the EA have a built-in filter for not trading on Friday? My 20-pair demo and my 10-pair demo have not traded once today.

This thread is meant for the Pivot Trading EA coded by Akangaziz.  
  
@Buddakarn, thanks very much for sharing the indicators, I don't mean to be rude, in order to keep this thread focused, if anyone is sharing/promoting/discussing another EA/indicator, may I suggest you start another thread? Thank you! 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

> Hi Akangziz, Thank you for your effort coding the Pivot Trading EA. I would like to help forward testing it. I am running the v0.51 EA since this morning, on a HotForex demo $100K account, with default settings but 0.1 lot size on 28 pairs + XAUUSD. Will share the results in a week. Terima Kasih, WindChaser
> 
> Ignored

1st week's 28+Gold pairs test result based on $100K demo account with 0.1 lot size. Total profit: $888.70, Max. DD: $121.78. Profit Factor: 4.14.  
  
v0.51 opened a total of 131 trades on 11 pairs (EURJPY/USDJPY/GBPAUD/GBPJPY/CHFJPY/AUDUSD/USDCAD/AUDCAD/AUDNZD/NZDCHF/GBPCHF). Most profitable pair was EURJPY, least profitable pair was GBPCHF. Please see screenshot below.  
  
Certainly a very encouraging set of result, but let's not be too excited yet as it will be even more interesting to see how the EA fare in high volatility environments this coming week as Trump's tariff/trade war is about to kick into higher gear.  
  
Also, I am interested to know the results if anyone has tried playing with the default settings of "profit in pips to start adding volume", "profit in pips to close all trades", "activate martingale?" and "lot multiplier for martingale" of the EA.  
  
Thanks again, Akangaziz.

> Hello, Dear AZIZ and friends. What do you think about placing trailing stop at version 0.52? and that this is activated from the profit that I want. Will version 0.52 be available to work on real account? You must be doing BT to each with version 0.52, when you throw it, could you please place the result of each pair with the benefits and the maximum DD? Thank you very much for all your friend Aziz, you are the FF Crack. Sorry my bad english, its google traslator.

> Ignored

Hi, in first version I already use trailing stop. but somehow I get the result is not maximum. this is because usually price will move to other direction before going back to expected direction.  
  
yes, I will share v0.52 soon.

i also fixed some bugs in v0.52, i plan to release next week. just keep watching ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

exit criteria:  
if EA have at least 2 opened trade for that pair:  
price hit SL.  
or if floating is bigger than x equity (from setting)  
or if TDI give the oppilosite signal  
  
if only 1 trade:  
will close if after 24hour EA still not reach 5 pips profit

The stop loss position seems too large compare to the take profit condition(100pips).  
I am not sure using trailing stop can solve the issue or not.

it's glad to know demo account almost/will blow up today because of the strong trend. so we can learn something from it.  
what I learn from today result is all of this losing trade against the signal from D1 trend.   
  
I also take a simple note that almost all floating trade (ended up with a win or ended with account blew-up) is against trend from D1.   
I will take this as a serious note for next version.  
  
I hope this is the false signal filter that I'm looking for the last 3 months.

Aziz, maybe using the angle meter arrow as a filter would have prevented the EA from loading up on buying the comm doll pairs? I don't really understand how the arrow filter works? is there a way I could only have a buy sell entry on a pair using the M15 arrow? do I just set the property as true and then keep the charts on 15 min?

Yesterday at the height of volatility my total DD was $13K on the $100K (28pairs+Gold) account. With GBPJPY taking up a large chunk of DD. Today the DD is down to $3K-$4K level as prices retraced.  
  
I wonder if we do not trade the 38 S/R levels and increase the "profit in pips to start adding volume" from 5 to 10 or 15, will that help in mitigating large DD, what do you think Akangaziz?  
  
Thanks,

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

Completely agree with you, mate. The original system does not trade 38R/S, only 61 & above. No idea why the OP opted for the 38R/S levels.

I have the main 6 pairs, on a demo 10k. yestarday AUDUSD had about 75$ DD and same USDCAD. today AUDUSD closed with small loss and USDCAD still running.  
  
the issue, that i see, is the number of open position during mega trend. on that demo i have a limit of 200 open positions.

Hi All  
  
I love this thread and would like to see it succeed but i feel that to give it a real chance it needs to be changed, i think there should be:  
  
1, a set account balance which everyone needs to stick to  
  
easy to implement  
  
2, A fixed risk in $$$$ for sl , now this is not easy as sl is determined by the expectation of the move from pivot to pivot so its dependant on the market from pair to pair, i dont know if this can be done  
  
3, So as we have our set account balance we can then decide what our risk is , on main thread of pivot Davit says to risk only 2 to 3% of account , is this per trade or globally as with many trades running we are risking far mor , im assumimng its per trade so risk of account will be much greater at times  
  
4, Everyone should be running the same set of pairs so when trades are taken with different broker its easy to compare outcome on main thread post #1  
suggested pairs are UC AC NC EA AU GU NU AN EU Yen crosses like CJ NJ AJ , i think this would be good especially for ea as it rules out the big movers like geppy etc  
  
Problems to overcome:  
  
How to tell robot to scale in trades based on human feeling of PA and how many trades to risk?  
  
How to tell Robot fundamentals are good or bad and even more how they combine over a space of time to strengthen or weaken a currency  
  
this is just my little input to try and make this work if anyone can add to this or make my suggestions better then im sure it will help OP with his/her goal  
  
of course delete if you think im wrong  
  
thx wags

Hi Fabio based on Davit thread with 6 pairs max open postions would be 60 to 90 , but also that would be max 10 to 15 per pair as well so if you cannot set open positions to pair trhen its all irrelivant

I'm impressed that you bounced back. I am still running v.51 and account went from 10300 down to 8000 but has only bounced back to 8800 now. Most of my losses in gbpjpy. I agree with you about both increasing profit in pips and maybe striking the 38s/r levels as trade triggers. I still like the idea of only allowing a trade entry if there has been at least a 75% atr move as well.

I totally disagree. People should run the EA as they see fit, with whatever account size they choose too. With whatever pairs they use. Any bugs that arise should be reported back. Any successes as well.

Then you obviously have no experience in testing a strategy on an EA , the EA is based on Davits pivot strat so what you are basically saying is you want to take away one of the most important parts of his strat?

Really? I think it is you who hasn't a clue! What is the point of different people using the same ea, trading the same currency pairs, with the same size account, with the same $risk? Is that how Davit's system works? The EA will run the same on each platform except for small differences in brokers due to [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide"), etc if everyone uses the same set of parameters, right? Regardless of whether it is running on one platform or 100. You are such an expert on Davit, is that how he trades? WTF do you mean I am taking away one of the most important parts of his strategy? What part of his strategy is that? Telling everyone exactly which pairs to trade and when to enter and where to put the stops? I think not, and that would get you banned after your first post on Davits thread.  
  
So, I won't be joining you in testing the pairs that you want to test with the EA properties set just as you want them to be. I suspect you will have few takers. I suggest you setup 10 or 100 demo accounts, install the EA on each one and let it run with exactly the same inputs. My guess is the results will be pretty close on all accounts. Have fun.

Hey Aziz, Is there a copy of v0.50 on this thread anywhere? I did a quick search but only see v0.51. I'd like to run the original if that is possible side by side with the other. But with the pairs that I choose and the properties that I set. Thanks!

Hi Joe, I think Aziz is releasing v0.52 soon, so v0.50 will be superseded by it. v0.52 contains the extra "Aggressiveness" feature of v0.50 which you can opt to turn on/off. See #Post 437 ([https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...1#post11177121](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=11177121#post11177121))

I would like to update the results of my 2nd week test using v0.51 EA (28+Gold pairs forward test result based on $100K demo account with 0.1 lot size trades).  
  
2nd week net profit was $1773.15, together with 1st week's net profit, it's $2661.85.  
  
Last week, v0.51 opened/closed a total of 414 trades on 20 pairs, most profitable pair was XAUUSD, least profitable pair was USDCAD, see screenshot below. At one point on 19 June my DD was hovering around $13K, now at the point of writing the DD is around $3K. I do see the value in setting large SL, as prices tend to rebound/retrace, with smaller SL I believe many of my last week's positions would have been closed with huge losses.  
  
Aziz, when will you release v0.52?  
  
Thanks,  
WindChaser

awesome. there's a bug in v0.51 if lot size is not 0.01, sometimes it closed trades with minus not profit. it explains why the graphic is not smooth.

Okay, I didn't read every post, so maybe this question answered already; but if so, Post #1 needs updating.  
  
I see these thing mentioned in Post #1 -  
  
\- this new thread is about Pivot Trading system, by Davit.  
\- Timeframe: H4 (based on backtesting in major pairs, H4 give me best result)  
\- what timeframe is suitable for Pivot Trading EA? so far H4 is the best  
  
But my understanding of Davit Pivot trading is to use Weekly Pivots, so the price levels stay the same all week, Monday to Friday  
  
So, for example, if the EA is selling the R61, it is the same price on 15 minutes chart as it is on the 4 Hours chart  
  
I don't see how the backtesting can be affected by this Time Frames, if it is following the original concept.  
  
There is a Trade Manager in that thread now, uses the Average True Range for Take Profit, makes sense to me, as every pair has different daily ranges.  
  
Please, let me know. looks like it is doing great today with recovery!

If that is the case, it's not trading Davit Pivot method, more like trading made simple

6% drawdown, that is still somewhat modest considering the profits... I am cautiously optimistic. Very much looking forward to the release of the next version.

Hey guys,  
  
When I put the template on or the ea on a chart it always says "failed to get data from server, please check your setup"   
Maybe the reason because I don't have the pivot indicator the right one ?  
  
  
Thanks for the help ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

So, unless I am mistaken that is about 35% return in less than a full month on an initial account size 5k is that correct? That is nice. Definitely a good move to take out the 38 levels, unless perhaps it is a strongly trending pair, for example, next week I think I would be willing to let ea take short on au at r38 or long uc at s38?   
Anyway, those are great results.

Yes really good and I've hide first day in which I've used too aggressive martingale value for AUDJPY with good gain but also a huge dd.   
Problem now is Ea seems stopped or better I've error in journal and no any orders opened so I don't know if EA is OK or not .. We'll see next week and hope for the update

GBPJPY last week. too early exit the trades. I still have homework to maximize profit from this kind of price movement.

Hello akangaziz,  
At GBP-YEN the H4 was a divergence, for me an entry signal, then until the next resistance.  
Maybe you can incorporate divergence into your Ea.

Hi Akangaziz, instead of the 100-pip take profit settings, can you code an alternative way to let the profit run and only close the trades using TDI/Angleator? 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

I'm not sure if the goal should be maximizing profit here. I think David's system is more about fading the move at s/r levels, and taking the easy money. You'll always leave some profits on the table. I think easiest to is the next major fib level or pick a percentage atr retrace.

Hi cescof!  
Which version you use on the Account Equity Analyzer indicator. I found Account Equity Analyzer v4.1 + Draw Orders + Virtual Balance, but I can not compile it. Can you share the indicator?  
Thanks!

Well I had this on demo and was very impressed with results, went live this week and preliminary results equally impressive until yesterday, when getting same errors as Juraia and no trades, big disappointment, hope it can be looked at soon.

just go in the ea settings and set trade on RS38 to false, is there a specific reason you set multiplier to 1.1?

Load it on a Demo account, preferably 4H timeframe according to Akangaziz [Automatic trading]. Try it on the major pairs and others (use different magic number for each pair).

sorry forgot the very first post you mentioned already.  
  
so far the EA is doing fine, 20 charts now, martiMultilier=1.1, rest of parameters as per default default, later I will attach the log, in a zip, but i have not seen any odd behaviour or as not per rules.

I paid attention to that, every chart has different magic number...it's not because of that.

Akangaziz, I ran the v0.51 EA on 28 pairs (and XAUUSD), using the SAME Magic Number, it worked fine on the demo account. Do you know why? Thanks. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

As those links are to paid signals, I suggest you either remove them or FF will force you to become a commercial member.....

you can't set to 0 for real account signal in mql5.  
  
_The basic subscription price is set per month and cannot be lower than 30 USD._  
_Only signals based on demo accounts can be provided for free._  
  
so I have to find another trading publisher because I can't use FF trade explorer.

Yes, I totally understand that, but that doesn't change the FF rules. As suggested above, try MyFXBook

v0.6 result after 24 hours in real account so far. with long term setting.  
maximum profit setup (use big TP, enable close trade if TDI crossing in the opposite direction): TF H4, TF entry/exit setting use M15 (aggressive setup), TP 500 pips, in 20 pairs.   
  
the idea of long term setting is we will let the EA keep the profitable trades until reaches TP (500 pips) or close trade once the TDI changes. this is risky because sometimes the price move against the trade after some floating profits.

v0.6 result after 24 hours in a real account so far. with short-term setting.  
quick profit setup (use default TP, enable close trade if TDI crossing in the opposite direction): TF H4, TF entry/exit setting use M15 (aggressive setup), TP 100 pips, in 20 pairs.   
  
  
I also have a problem with v0.6, especially with ATR setup. _**do I need to share it now or wait until I fix the ATR feature fixed?**_  
ATR setting in v0.6 will let define the TP, SL and pips distance based on multiplier value from ATR (14). so basically, each pair will have their own unique TP, SL, and pips distance because their ATR will different with other pairs.

I find pivot points to be best as probable targets than ATR values, afterall we are doing swing trading so it would be nice a programmable pivot points TP feature for example if we bought at S61, to be able to close xx% at S38 and xx% at weekly pivot would be sweet.

xx stands for an amount that can be choosen by the user, for example if we are long from S61 close 50% of the open positions at S38 and 50% at weekly pivot, or 33% at S38, 33% at WP and 33% at R38.

here we go. Pivot Trading EA v0.6  
  
download here: <https://goo.gl/M8PyLA>  
  
bugs fixed:  
\- error code 400 & 403 when calling web service  
\- incorrect pips calculation when closing all trades if lot size is more than 0.01  
\- increase accuration for entry/exit. now you can choose which timeframe you want for entry & exit confirmation. more smaller the timeframe confirmation, more aggressive the EA. M15/M30 is aggressive setting, H1 & H4 is moderate.  
  
new feature:  
\- ATR ----> still have bugs, need more time to fix this. you can use this ATR setting to true only if you use a demo account, don't use in real account. still experimental.  
\- more tight SL value. v0.51 the SL is in S200/R200 if martingale is active, now in v0.6 SL is 2 pivot line distance from the current price. ex: if order opened in S38, SL value is more or less at S78.  
\- trade protection setting if trade takes more than 24 hours. you can set this from setting. if EA trade more than 24 hour and still not TP or still not closed by opposite TDI cross, EA will close the trade at minimum 1 pips profit. this is to prevent floating trades more than a day, especially for short-term setting.  
\- maximizing the profit by use long-term setting. long term setting is let the EA open the existing trades until the TDI cross in the opposite direction. Or if certain pips (ex: 500 pips) is reached, EA will close all trades. this setting is more risky but more profitable for a long term. use at your own risk! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
\- setting limit for max opened trades  
  
backlog:  
\- fix ATR calculation  
\- news filter: this part still not integrated yet because I still need to find out what is the good mechanism to close or let the trades running after/before news.  
-  
  
known bugs:  
\- sometime you will find pivot line is not displayed properly in your second chart, usually works in 1st chart. this is known bugs, but doesn't impact pivot calculation .it's only for display purpose.  
\- indicator TDI-RT-Clone-rAlgo still use the previous version. I know sometimes it takes time to load indi for the first time (little bit slow), but after first init it will works well.  
  
term of use:  
1\. use this EA at your own risk.  
2\. author can't guarantee the trading will always profit or will not MC.  
3\. your account information is synced to my server for monitoring purpose (account size, account number, leverage, broker name, account owner, EA version), If disagree with this, please don't use my EA.  
  
note:  
1\. I forward test v0.6 in

  1. [FBS](/brokers/fbs "View FBS Broker Profile") (2 accounts. 1 with short-term setting with 1000 usd initial balance, 1 with long-term setting with 920 usd initial balance)
  2. [Tickmill](/brokers/tickmill "View Tickmill Broker Profile"): short-term setting with 610 usd balance.

2\. you can test at any broker. my recommendation is put EA at TF H4 only. and set the entry/exit confirmation to M15 or M30 for aggresive setting (possible MC if balance is low or trend is strong) or use H1 or H4 for moderate setting.  
3\. better to turn-off EA before big news release to prevent strong trend.  
  
  
v0.6 short-term setting:

I like how you crossed out some parts of your posts. I wonder why he keeps doing that. Turning potential friends to enemies.  
  
It's like someone asking for directions and you tell the person to read the street signs (which is OK) but you go a step further and insult the person for not knowing where the street sign is.  
  
I'm not able to use your EA (because I haven't tried). I'm still placing my trades manually with the spare time I get. Good job making an EA 

when you can accurately predict the future, you leave nothing to chance.

the difference between short-term setting & long-term setting (actually it is about TP). see the setting from my previous post.

both settings will expect to close trades max after 24hours, even with 1 pips accumulative profit. but if still floating, it will always open until profit 1 pips or hit SL or TDI cross in the opposite direction or there's big candle (opposite direction) in H1 TF. this is to prevent EA from more than 1 day floating, because if floating more than 1 day, it means there's problem in entry accuration.

The first post state that backtested in 4 hr timeframe.  
Is that not possible to do anymore?  
  
Akang perhaps the TP should be set at the nearest pivot, when it touched 100 set to 78, 78 to 61, but if the price starts from 61 but it jumps to 78, then all order closed when it touched 61, ive seen many post on davit does that, and maybe a line in a chart as a close all order line instead of percentage of equity as money management.

Another addition that i think could be useful is making the first position's SL and TP to close all order and add a break even and break even slide function, this will make sure when the SL is triggered we lose x pips from only a few lot instead of full lot.

I think you may want to attach the instructions from page 9 on the thread or move those instructions to page 1 and you will avoid getting so many installation questions, page 1 does not have all the details required for setup of EA (I think?). Just trying to make it easier for you so you don't get bombarded with the same questions from 30 different users.

the template seems to be loading fine on most pairs, but for some reason the pivots on usdcad seem to be way off, for example this week it indicates the pair has touched low b/w s138-161, and has been below s78 for the entire week. Does anyone have any ideas how to correct this? I have deleted chart and reinstalled the template onto it, just cannot get it to look correct. Any reply would be appreciated.

what is the easiest way to do this? Turn off auto trading on each chart? or just close down mt4?

I think this EA need a spread Filter to avoid high spread. 

Think before you trade!

Akangaziz, I'm assuming this version will not open trades on Friday; does it close all trades Friday am? Or just not open new trades? I don't see this as a choice on the inputs. Thanks, it looks really incredible!

yes, it will not open initial trades on Friday. but for existing trades will continue unless hit TP or SL or meet other exit rules.

> 
> Ignored

yes too risky. just use 2-3 pairs with default setting. or if you insist want to use 8 pairs, increase value setting for:  
\- profit in pips to start adding volume from 5 to 20   
\- profit in pips to close all trades from 100 to 50 or 70  
\- timeframe for entry/exit confirmation if TDI crossing: from M15 to H1  
\- TDI max for BUY: from 40 to 30 or 20  
\- TDI min for SELL: from 60 to 70 or 80. remember, the total of TDI max for buy + TDI min for SELL must equal with 100  
  
the setting above may be can save your account (default setting is aggressive) from quick mc but pls always stop EA during the news release.

Akang perhaps the TP should be set at the nearest pivot, when it touched 100 set to 78, 78 to 61, but if the price starts from 61 but it jumps to 78, then all order closed when it touched 61, ive seen many post on davit does that, and maybe a line in a chart as a close all order line instead of percentage of equity as money management.

for me, I will disable EA (to prevent EA open initial trade). and take a look for other pairs (if we have floating trades), will close all floating trades if the historical impact for news is BIG, no matter how big the loss. but if a historical impact is not big, i will let it run.  
  
the good thing from v0.6 is the SL is tighter/slimmer than prev version. usually, SL size is 2-3 time from TP size. ex if TP with default setting is you will get 10 usd, if SL you will loss around 20-30 USD. but pls note that in 1 day you will have more TP or profit trades than SL trades. for long-term, this is profitable.  
  
1 SL can be paid by 2 or 3 TP. and in 1 day you will have a lot trading opportunity from many pairs. based on my random calculation in v0.6, usually profit or TP trades vs SL trades is around 5:1.

usually because you forgot to add "http://skycode.co.id" in web request setting. from Tools > Option.  
or it happens during the EA initialization to validate the account & EA version from server. if this happen, just re-attach EA to chart.

change the language for your MT4 to English. I think the indicator can't support the chinese text.

By my side I've started with default set but I had sl reached for cadjpy and audjpy... With 72 € loss sadly real..... I wish for the future... Maybe sl is not a good choice for this kind of system ..  
Thanks for effort

Hi Fernand, as you know no EA is perfect, otherwise it would be the "Holy Grail".   
  
The v0.51 Pivot EA is still work in progress ("Beta" in software terms), that's why its version name is still staring with 0.xx, once the EA is steady and ready, it will be versioned as v1.0. Also, the choice of which pairs to trade, would affect the profitability of this EA, since it's not suitable for some hyper-crossing pairs.  
  
Respectfully, if you are running this EA in a real-money account, you have to assume the risks and take responsibility for your action and come to terms with any losses.  
  
Green pips,  
WindChaser 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)It's a pivot EA, if no condition exists EA will not open trade. Isn't scalping EA.

LOL you are looking for the holy grail EA? Did you see such of EA that opened only prifitable positions? 2nd: using this trading method (pivot by Davit) will you see sometimes losses but in total you will win and the profit will more than the loss.

"TF entry/exit for TDI Crossing" setting if you use M15 then it's aggressive setting. you can change this to a moderate value like H1 or H4.   
SL is tighter in v0.6 to prevent floating in loss for more than 1 or 2 days.   
  
I can't guarantee the result will always good. what can I recommend is if you plan for long-term profit, then u need to have a conservative setting (not aggressive).

“SL is tighter in v0.6 to prevent floating in loss for more than 1 or 2 days”  
  
Aziz, I think Davit’s method allow up to one week for floating loss, as long as the total DD for a particular swing/pair does not exceed a pre-determined amount (eg $500 SL)  
  
Is there a setting which you can code to allow looser SL threshold?  
  
Thanks a lot,

yes, you are right. there is max dd setting, but SL is 2 pivot distance from open price in v0.6.   
  
let see 1 more week to check performance for this SL.  
if not good enough, we can change or improve it.

In my opinion, if trying to imulate Davits strategy you should always start trading at R/S 61 and make your SL at R/S 138. Use the pip distance between the 61 and 138 pivots as your SL and figuring your lot sizes, not just randomly 2 pivot levels, that is not his strategy. Once price goes past R/S 100 it could be in a trend. R/S 100 is still a tradable pivot , hence using R/S138 as your SL.

spot on! once we selected how much we want to risk per swing trade and distance and numbers of limit orders than an EA like this could help a lot.

This is better than trading without stop loss.  
  
Well done 

when you can accurately predict the future, you leave nothing to chance.

When I was studying Davit's pivot trading method I was thinking, an EA of this would be awesome! I have just stumbled upon your thread and it made me really happy to see it's going so well. Great job on making the EA ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f600.png?v=15.1)  
  
I will be following to see if I can be of any help. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1) I trade the pivot method manually at the moment.

I get some feedback from member here about tight SL ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1), so now I'm preparing v0.7 to fix some problems in v0.6:  
  
\- SL   
\- fix bug in entry. somehow EA open the trade not exactly at TDI crossing.  
\- remove ATR feature (useless for longterm trade / trade with > 500 pips TP)  
\- fix bug for max trade hour calculation  
\- enable the backtest, but I will selected only few people to have backtest access.   
  
How to have backtest access:  
\- post the EA progress (chart picture or EA trade result picture): each posting will have 10 point. max 1 pic per pair per day or per cycle. only valid for v0.7 above.  
\- never post unrelated content (ex: post useless indicator that even not related with Pivot Trading. indicator for trading summary is allowed.): each mistake related with this will reduce 50 point.  
\- don't give your bad review or your bad opinion about other FF member in my thread, ex: posting about negative things about Davit, you will loss all the point ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) (better you create your own thread to talk about it).. Remember, Davit is the one who give us this amazing trading strategy. we owe him.  
\- active give input based on your forward test. each input (that make sense for future development) will have 30 point.  
  
member with minimum point 200 will get free backtest access from me. The backtest code will be sent by PM once you get 200 point.  
point calculation will be reviewed every 3 days or follow my availability.  
  
thanks

Do you mean access to **forward** testing? In the sense that people will be able to test it live.

Hello, I would like to ask a question, after this EA is finalized, will it be distributed for free?  
  
\----  
I started testing EA this month, I left it at 3 vps.  
100 $ (very conserved)  
500 $ (moderate)  
1000 $ (aggressive medium)

> "TF entry/exit for TDI Crossing" setting if you use M15 then it's aggressive setting. you can change this to a moderate value like H1 or H4. SL is tighter in v0.6 to prevent floating in loss for more than 1 or 2 days. I can't guarantee the result will always good. what can I recommend is if you plan for long-term profit, then u need to have a conservative setting (not aggressive).

Akangaziz, Is it possible to add long only/short only to the EA? I'm just curious (and I know that this is not staying true to Davits Strategy, but I do think it would be nice feature). The reason that I ask this is I would much rather use the ea to get an entry that correlates with the trend on a longer timeframe. I'd feel much more comfortable for example, setting the EA up so that it might take a sell on the pair at r38, but I would not really feel comfortable buying it on s38... In fact at this point I might not want to buy it even at s100.

v0.7 will take SL 100% from entry price. SL for S38 is S138, S61 is S161, S78 is S200 (I don't have S178 ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)), S100 is S200  
  
and %equity setting already there since v0.5. but with a different concept. it will close all trade in 1 pair if floating more than x% value, where x is defined as max drawdown in EA setting.

for backtest only. with proper backtest method, you will get a big picture how the EA works. of course backtest can't guarantee future result, but we want to cover all technical possibilities. esp with big trend.

For next update , could you solve problem for refresh pivot line draw automatically every week. Now to have the right pivot on the charts we have to reload Ea manually for every pairs.  
Thanks

Hello everyone/anyone. I have wanted to trade this method for several months but I havent been able to due to my personal time constraints. This EA is definitely appreciated. Thank you Akangaziz.   
  
I put the EA on a few charts but I keep getting a webrequest error code: 4000 and 503. Any body else encounter this? I have the URL allowed already and verified that I typed it in correctly.   
  
Any help would be appreciated. Thank.s

guys, I experiment with v0.7 now. In v0.6 if use tf entry/exit M15 somehow it cause a big drawdown because of entry accuracy.  
  
download v0.7: <https://goo.gl/3F3L2a>  
  
changes log:  
1\. remove entry/exit option, it will follow timeframe where EA attached.  
2\. increase possibility to WIN. i got this conclusion from backtest.  
3\. backtest enable. If you think you are a good strategy tester, just keep posting in this thread. I will PM you once you are able to get backtest code.  
  
here the status in my 3 account:  
1\. [FBS](/brokers/fbs "View FBS Broker Profile") short-term setting: 19% profit. still use v0.6  
2\. FBS long-term setting: 30% profit. still use v0.6  
3\. [Tickmill](/brokers/tickmill "View Tickmill Broker Profile") short-term setting: loss 2%. I change to v0.7 default (default setting is long-term setting).

hi akangaziz  
  
i was using the v 0.6 and i think i found the problem for such dd  
  
i liked the lower time frame entry, cause it gives a faster entry.. but i notice why it was not working properly  
  
pls try to do this, and run a backtest if it works fine update it to newer version.  
  
keep the lower TF entry.. 15M/1H  
and create a rule to only place the first order if the TDi (fast?green) is above or below the 70-30 (or other period, but i like this ones) on current time frame.. 4H  
  
this will keep the davits logic without adding any indicators, with a faster entry, and without that many false entrys.. i hope  
  
  
btw version 6 is working for me.. i dont know why 5.1 wasnt

thanks for your feedback.  
how's the result so far? would you like to help to find a good setting for EA v0.6 based on lower timeframe entry? if yes, I will PM you for "how to backtest".

no problem just send me the version 6 available.. maybe i can find some values and TF entrys..  
  
  
i also need to know how arrow filters works.  
  
i dont think the angle could really be a good add on for this ea in particulary but... i suspect that one rule like this could seriorsly improve it:  
  
dont buy if higher or current time frame arrow red  
  
dont sell if higheror current time frame arrow green  
  
this could stop the ea from tryng to catch falling nifes.. the price usualy stays in the pivot some time allowing the daily arrow change to neutral before decide to make a 4H reverse.. but i truly i dont know if is better to make on current TF or on higher TF.. that need to be tested  
  
  
i just started the EA on 6 pairs this week on opening.. have some floating loss. nothing to worrie.  
  
  
long term (500), no marti, 15min entry, all pivot

but keep mind that adding the rule on the previous post could make the lower TF entry useless since the neutral arrow will be after the TDi lower TF cross  
  
let me analise this first before making any changes.. maybe theres a possibliy it works depend on the tf for entry logic and TF entry filter

well there no need to send the "how to backtest" at least for now. did it visual.. old school style..  
  
on the entry TF logic your right. its better to have it on the current TF.. the 15M its madness and the 1H gives almost no extra value, even with the 4H abouve/below tdi values rule.  
  
about the arrows slope it needs to be on the next higher time frame to be useful current 4H.. tdi slope 1D.. (if you want to implement it)  
not buy on red arrows  
not sell on green arrows  
  
on TDI values if the rule above where to be implemented it truly needs to be on 60-40 values to give space to price and tdi make the cross.  
  
i still thing if you dont implement the rule it could be some margin for an tdi optimization, around 65-35. but the tdi slope arrows colour seems a good defence agains strong trends

Why you don't allow all traders to make backtest with your EA?

because not everyone know how to do a backtest with 99.9% data modeling and have good capacity to find good setting for EA.   
they also need to know how the EA works.   
  
based on my experience, reading and follow-up feedback from incapable tester is wasting time.

to be honest I start with EUNOK, happy that I have trade; and I saw that that spread is 63 pips - creazy . Now is little better ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Punten kang Aziz,  
  
i don't mean to put negative comment, but as long as my experience as a trader, its difficult for me to trust the backtest result. manytimes I do the backtest with the result are amazing, but in forward test, the result are the opposites.  
  
so in my opinion kang... the good thing is to trust the FT even you have to consume a lot of time. it's pain but it works. itu aja dulu sih kang. punten saya mulai ikutan FT EA nya ya kang. Makasih.

why does it put profit at weekly pivot even if "profit in pips to close all trades" parameter is set to a different value?

Make sure you have done this:

  2. **Make sure magic number (from EA propeties) is unique for every chart and currency pair opened.**

I hope it helps.

The error codes I posted about previously seem to not affect the EA since it has taken some trades since then.  
  
I am personally not a big fan of backtests. Forward tests is where you get a real feel for the strategy. I have seen backtests give different results than the same test period from a forward test. Many variables come into play in live trading that are not there in backtests. Even when you use 99.9% quality. However, backtests are important to verify the EA and trading logic.  
  
I wont be able to post too many trade setups due to time but I will pop in sometimes to show some of the more interesting setups. Here are two from today. Very precise. Both trades closed within pips of the top/bottom of the moves. Like a close shave with a sharp razor.

Hi Aziz, good day, I was busy with work the past few days and only found out today that you released v0.7 two days ago, THANK YOU and kudos!  
  
I have been testing v0.6 the past week and the profit was $600 (CENTS), my personal feedback is that the "Timeframe for Entry/Exit" settings in v0.6 caused the EA to stop-loss the running trades too soon, however one thing good about v0.6 was the relatively low DD. All said, I am looking forward to test v0.7 starting today (not a great day to start since it's end of the trading week, but heck, let's put the EA through its paces).  
  
Question regarding "use angle meter arrow as entry filter" and "use angle meter degrees as entry filter" settings, do you suggest we turn them ON or OFF?  
  
Green pips everyone, and thank you once again, Aziz!  
  
Cheers,  
WindChaser

Hi Aziz,  
  
I examined the new trades opened by v0.7 on GBPJPY, found an odd behavior, do you know why in a span of few seconds it opened these trades with almost the same prices?  
  
Thanks,

Post #649, I attach one v0.7 copy here.  
  

  
Timeframe H4, so far the best pairs for me are XAUUSD and USDCAD, I suggest you can try it on the majors and see how it goes.  
  
Green pips,

You can try default settings first. Check out Post 616 ([https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...4#post11263164](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=11263164#post11263164)) and complete the requirements there to get the free v0.7 backtest access from Aziz. Cheers.

@mrbilio and @noshali, Aziz has coded all the necessary indicators into the EA, so there is no other indicators you need to add. But even if you would like to add them, that's more for your understanding and evaluation.  
  
@noshali, if you see the smiley face on top right corner of your chart, that's a good sign. Also, you can check the "Experts" tab of the Terminal to see the EA action log/messages.  
  
The pivot lines drawn by this EA can be erratic sometimes, I am not sure if @akangaziz has fixed it in v0.7, I believe even if the visual pivot lines are not drawn correctly on the charts, the EA is still working fine and would trade at the correct R/S pivot points.  
  
Cheers,

By my side I'm in live with 0.70 I'm not at home in these days and I'll post result here next days even if I have closed some positions manually near to ea tp just to avoid possible retrace. So 0.70 seems really good.  
I don't understoood if in this version Atr is usable or not.

I guess we do have to report any issues with the EA.  
Pivot lines are not being drawn on the chart. Also, how many trades should we expect in a day or a week?

For v0.7 EA, if the default value of "profit in pips to calose all trades" is "1000", that might be too high a target for the EA to close, I suggest you put "100" or "200" or "300". Perhaps the backtest will be able to tell us what's the best value for this particular setting. "max opened trades" is another setting which you can increase to add more positions for a particular swing.  
  
As your test progresses, you can choose to add some excitement (read: risk) by setting "lot multiplier for martingale" to "1.1" or "1.2". You can also consider changing the "profit in pips to start adding volume" value, the bigger the value the lesser the risk (to some extend).  
  
Cheers,

Account have 100$  
pairs - >NZDCHF EURAUD AUDCHF NZDUSD NZDJPY AUDJPY - H4  
I observed that pairs with / JPY have been showing better results.  
Martingale OFF - I do not like trying to increase or double the chance of winning or losing in the long run can be harmful  
Purpose of my test is to try to triple the $ 100 account with DD max 10-20%.  
If you can find this setting, you could replicate it to a $ 1000 account with even smaller DDs and higher scores.  
Imagine what that would be like? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f911.png?v=15.1)  
For testing on a $ 100 account, I recommend lowering the pairs and the maximum number of trades from 5 to 4.  
Best Pairs NZDJPY | EURAUD.  
For a $ 100 account try using only those pairs:  
NZDJPY | EURAUD | GPBJPY  
Max open trades - 5 for 4  
  
And Congratulations to the EA [akangaziz](https://www.forexfactory.com/akangaziz), I hope you continue to develop and perfect it.

@[akangaziz ](https://www.forexfactory.com/akangaziz)  
It would be possible to put a trailing stop.  
And Another interesting option is if the EA could closet all position 30 minutes before closing the last session on Friday.  
I believe that with this our chance of success and profit increase a lot.

That's a stunning result! I'm trading the pivots manually without EA and I can say the EA works better than humans here haha.

I have set up my demo (ICMarkets ECN-Pro 1:500) with the v0.7 and will be reporting results next week. Default setting, maybe with less pips TP and less max orders (from 10 to 5, I'll test).  
  
Based on [WGChina's post's](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=11282695#post11282695) results this week I've set up the EA on the following 10 pairs, avoiding the ones with poor performance:  
  
CADCHF, EURCHF, AUDCHF, USDCAD, EURUSD, GBPCAD, AUDJPY, NZDJPY, EURNZD, GBPJPY  
  
**UPDATE: ADDED 6 MORE:** EURGBP, AUDNZD, NZDCHF, GBPNZD, NZDUSD, EURCAD  
  
Of course others can work too but I'll use these for now.  
  
Can't wait to see the results!! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f600.png?v=15.1)

In my case it also happened that when I put the EA on a chart it will not draw the lines, but restarting the MT4 fixes it ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1) of course with AutoTrading on, allow DLL, your web link added, etc.

I will be testing on Monday. People who give a good result, could you give an image with your setting? This will be very helpful for other people who want to test Ea with different settings.

Hey guys,  
  
@akangaziz, thanks for creating and sharing the EA. Very generous of you. Will be testing all pairs on H4 TF and post results next friday. Green pips to all.

How long is this EA free?  
Someone else developed an indicator and people were constantly testing it. When it was completed and all errors were reported by the people and they were eliminated, it was no longer free.  
And that was not fair. Are you going to do this?

Hi mizor99, I am sorry I don’t really understand what you mean by “maybe I don’t manage things as well as I could”, do you mean you had to open and close trades manually even with using this EA? I don’t think the EA needs any manual intervention.  
  
Keep the test going and green pips to you! 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

I am on ICMarkets Demo as wont put an ea (LIVE) without testing using tick data suite, slippages, commissions and variable spread. I have put the EA on 1 H1 EURUSD and 2 H4 charts USDCAD and XAUUSD. The Ea has a smily face and pivots lines are drawn..I just had to reboot MT4. All looks good but no trades on Friday.  
  
Maybe if you provided the settings and wanted me to test, I could test on all 28 pairs using TDS or demo...which time frames etc wold greatly help as well.  
  
Ready to test when you are.  
  
Thanks

**![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/26a0-fe0f.png?v=15.1)Image with settings updated! Changed Profit in pips to close all from 400 to 350.**  
  
These will be my settings for the start of next week, and as mentioned above, with the 10 pairs listed in post #721. If I see unwanted behaviour/performance I will be changing them as the week goes. Account size: 1000€ (DEMO).  
  
These settings are a little more conservative than default. **Please note they are untested for now** so try custom settings at your own risk.  
  
Of course each pair's robot must have a different Magic number, for those who don't know.  
  
I trade this same strategy live with real money and I will be monitoring and comparing the robot with what I do.  
  
Can't wait for Monday! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f92a.png?v=15.1)

I'm worried about it, too...People will start to get good results after test and ea will disappear confidently

I hope this doesn't happen. If it happens I will personally create my own and share it, but I trust Akangaziz is sharing with good intentions ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Dear akangaziz  
You are a good person  
Thank you for sharing and paying  
In the V0.7 version I saw a good EA  
I have set up 12 pairs of currency proposed by Davit.  
UC AC NC EA AU GU NU AN EU CJ NJ AJ  
At present, based on my experience in pivot trading, I enter the general settings (H1) on each currency.  
In addition, on the same day,  
there will be a news event on the currency pair.  
I entered different settings (H4)  
MM is set to 1/2 ADR  
Starting next Monday  
I will use it in my real account.

Hello all,  
  

  
I am going to forward test this EA next week. I am enamored by the fact that the gains are so high while the drawdown is too low. This is a robot I have never seen before! Kudos to [akangaziz](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=11283477#post11283477)!  
  
If I see a robot with great potential, I am not scared to run it live using a small account. Anyway, I am using [FXTM](/brokers/fxtm "View FXTM Broker Profile") cent account. Let's see how it goes.

If you want to own this excellent strategy and not be at the mercy of someone else's whims, learn to use this system manually as Davit does. He even has several jobs on top of trading.  
  
I've used this system just twice a day - 8 am and 8 pm - for just 30 minutes and I'm very profitable.

Best of luck to both of you on your real account's journeys, the EA is very promising indeed as it is a really good strategy ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f604.png?v=15.1)

Yes, it's automatic. Once you set-up the EA and restart the platform (if not showing) the pivots will show automatically in each open chart, calculating last week's levels for this week's pivots.

Your setup is incorrect, you must have input the wrong number in TimeZoneOfData.  
  
Compare the EA's pivots with this page (set Weekly mode) and you will see the EA is very accurate: [https://www.actionforex.com/markets/...-pivot-points/](https://www.actionforex.com/markets/pivot-points/fibonacci-pivot-points/)  
  
If on your Davit Pivots 3.2 auto chart you have to see that the past week starting and ending point hours are 00:00 and 23:00. See attachment ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
**EDIT:** updated pic with correct week days.

Set Broker's Candle to FALSE. It's "TimeZoneOfData(NewYork GMT)" the setting you have to change. Put the number to 1 or 0 or -1, or 3 or 4 or 5 until it's correct, please READ my post and see the screenshot to compare the time of week open and close.

profit from last week. EA run 24 hour.  
drawdown is high because of some news release last week.  
If I can add news filter, this drawdown can be minimized.  
  
for me, the result and drawdown still tolerable for 1000usd account.  
but If I use bigger account (ex: >= 10k usd), this drawdown is not acceptable. yes I know, still a lot of homework before live with big account.

this one still use v0.6 - long term setting. [FBS](/brokers/fbs "View FBS Broker Profile").  
  
btw my v0.7 is not running since last week, because of ESMA leverage rule. I need to move from [tickmill](/brokers/tickmill "View Tickmill Broker Profile") and find another good broker with lev 1:500.  
hope this week I can finish the setup in the new broker. any recommendation? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

i tought that too.. but i really dont wanna have my money on the other side of the world.. although since it will be the only anwser for this problem its preferable to be an regulated broker..  
  
to make it worst- this ea its really an margin drinker, thats why i thoght on a cent account..

Hi vladi28, it's v0.7 beta, I think there are still some visual bugs regarding how the EA draws the pivot lines, let's wait for akangaziz to get back with some updates on this.  
  
Regarding testing the EA, my advice is to test it demo account first, not to rush in with real money and take it step by step.  
  
Green pips,  
WindChaser

I've used many, including [Tickmill](/brokers/tickmill "View Tickmill Broker Profile") and Admiral Markets. I use ICMarkets ECN-Pro now (real and demo) and it's great. Best I had so far.

akangaziz, I just had a problem with .6 hourly chart. It was trying to close trades at 100 profit, but using [OANDA](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile") a U.S. broker it couldn't close trades because of FIFO. Could you modify EA for FIFO close? Thanks. Bob.

**SOLUTION FOR EA (v0.7) NOT OPENING TRADES:**  
  
I found out that we've all been downloading v0.7 just the EA but not the "TDI-RT-Clone-rAlgo.ex4" indicator.  
  
We must go to the post 178 ([https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...4#post11142764](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=11142764#post11142764)) and download the zip file, and copy the indicator to the Mt4 data folder (MQL4/Indicators).  
  
I've just done this and as soon as I put the indicator in the folder, the EA started opening trades.  
  
@Akangaziz please include it in your v0.7 download post and future versions if you can

I thought the same, but maybe other users are working with 0.7 without problem because they already had prior versions. For new users maybe we have to still put it. In my case it proved necessary..

If I can add news filter, this drawdown can be minimized. for me, the result and drawdown still tolerable for 1000usd account. but If I use bigger account (ex: >= 10k usd), this drawdown is not acceptable. yes I know, still a lot of homework before live with big account. {image}

Its a hard one to factor in for news.... Trump can open his mouth at any time and everything can move against you!!  
  
But maybe a filter which sends an alert 30 mins prior to release of High impact news and no new trades to be opened 60 mins prior and 30 mins after releases might work?

Hey Vladi,  
  
Do you have the TDI-RT-Clone rAlgo indicator in the indicators folder? This is a must or else the EA won't open trades as it uses this as a base. Every time you add the EA to a chart, you must change the magic number. If the EA is loaded to multiple charts and the magic number is the same, MT4 is not able to distinguish which trade is which, causing an error in opening trades. Also, did you follow akangaziz' instruction in this post [https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...4#post11142764](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=11142764#post11142764)

thanks, I will ask help from the volunteer team for checking Pivot line across all major forex broker and summarize the feedback to me.   
I also find similar case in some broker, but have no idea what's the wrong part. since I follow and use the same code from original thread.

Is that profit in real money? I wonder if people are using live accounts now. As for me, I use two demo accounts for now.

If someone want to participate on the pivot line quest  
  
just pm me with the s/r pivot lines fo the pairs you are using and say what broker you have.  
  
Pls before doing that check if you already restated your mt4 this week.  
  
If you dont wanna write it, just screenshot.. _blank the account numers and name pls_  
  
  
i will compile the data. Maybe we will come to an answer..  
  
I know it will take a while for you to do this. But aziz is doing a great job for free for all of us. Lets keep some work out of his shoulders.

> SOLUTION FOR EA (v0.7) NOT OPENING TRADES: I found out that we've all been downloading v0.7 just the EA but not the "TDI-RT-Clone-rAlgo.ex4" indicator. We must go to the post 178 ([https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...4#post11142764](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=11142764#post11142764)) and download the zip file, and copy the indicator to the Mt4 data folder (MQL4/Indicators). I've just done this and as soon as I put the indicator in the folder, the EA started opening trades. @Akangaziz please include it in your v0.7 download post and future versions if you can Fixed! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)...

Thanks @Lolaso.  
  
Hi all, I clarified with akangaziz, there are only two files you need to get this EA running:  
1\. **rAlgo_pivot_trading_v0.7.ex4** save this in the **Experts** folder [File -> Open Data Folder -> MQL4 -> **Experts** folder]  
2\. **TDI-RT-Clone-rAlgo.ex4** , save this in the **Indicators** folder [File -> Open Data Folder -> MQL4 -> **Indicators** folder]  
  
(For newbies, remember to Right-click the **Indicators** and**Expert Advisors** header in **Navigator panel** and **Refresh** them, you should then be able to see the 2 newly installed items). After that you can drag the EA to the chart to attach it, however there is **no need** to drag the TDI Indi to the chart (as the EA will auto read the TDI indicator from the Indicators folder), but if you want to drag the TDI Indi to the chart to check the TDI graph, that's OK too.  
  

  
Cheers,  
WindChaser

You can try on H4 or H1 TF on demo accounts, share your results. Remember the EA is still in v0.7 Beta, so don't bet your house on it yet.

Is the only difference between V6 and V7 the exit? V6 exits 2 pivot levels from entry and V7 exits 100% from entry level (example if entry is R61 then exit will be S61)?

Hi chinchano, you added the **<http://skycode.co.id>** , correct? See # Post 795 above. Cheers. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

Hi bojack34,  
  
v0.6: The entry can mix with TF Entry confirmation in EA setting for TDI cross, and will read current TF for TDI top and bottom filter.  
  
v0.7: The entry uses only current TF, Aziz also fixed some bugs related to Entry setting.  
v0.7 SL example: Entry Buy at S61, SL at S161  
v0.7 TP example: Entry Buy at S61, TP at weekly pivot line, but usually trade will close after "profit in pips to close all trades" setting is reached.  
  
FYI, I am working with Aziz on an official user-guide document for this EA, will be sharing with the community when it's fully baked. Stay tuned!  
  
Cheers,

Sorry, I guess i'm a little too thick. I only see one input that has anything to do with Entry and I have it set to H4 (v0.6).."Timeframe for Entry/Exit Confirmation if TDI Crossing"

Yes it is that input. Setting "Timeframe for Entry/Exit Confirmation if TDI Crossing" is what I mean with TF Entry confirmation.  
  
H4 is the recommended TF, it produces more consistent, moderate/conservative results (which is good, right?), H1 might be riskier (maybe more false entries?), but nothing is stopping you from trying that on demo account ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

That is an excellent result Happylin. Would you share the settings and timeframe you are using?  
  
I saw your post #734 but would you show a screenshot of all EA settings?

Dear forum users.  
Hi  
The LINUX system, the MT4 platform, did everything as described. The adviser refuses to trade.

Hi Sasha, maybe the problem is your MT4 platform in Linux. Does other EA works on your Linux system?

Yes, each EA (1 EA per pair chart) must have a different magic number. For example I have 16 pairs, my EA magic numbers go from 1000 to 1016.

Will be interesting in seeing what DD you get whilst having 20 positions if it starts moving against you, will be great when its running with your orders however..  
  
Keep the updates coming, I have standard settings running at the moment on around 14 pairs and only max 5 posits to be opened per pair.

Was wondering how many server messages does this EA create? Are you aware?  
  
I only started trialing this tonight and just received a message from my broker saying my account is hyperactive...  
  
Does it send messages every tick?  
  
I had 5 successful trades already initialized, and closed now i'm not near my terminal and at work and received the email, weird.. Anyway only demo account that one so if they close it.. I'll open another one

Akangaziz,  
Can you please add a "Lots Per Balance" input that will allow us to change our lot sized used according to what balance we have in our account. Something that would look like this.....0.01/200. This can be adjustable in the inputs so if someone wanted to be more agressive they could change it to 0.01/100.......or if they wanted to be less aggressive they could change it to 0.01/500. Thanks! Very good ea btw!  
  
EDIT: Those were just random examples by the way. I would make your Default setting 0.01/1000 since most people are dealing with multiple pairs. If they wanted to get more aggressive because they are only trading a few pairs then they could go down to 0.01/750 or 0.01/500.......If they are going to trade a bunch of pairs they could go less aggressive and change it to 0.01/1500 or something. This will allow the user more control over their "initial" lot sizes.

I have been trading Davit's pivot strat for almost 1 month and a half now and I have to say that manual trading changed the way I trade 180º I came across this thread time ago but I was a bit scared about the drawdown...  
  
I always like to see if a strategy can be automated as my screen time is limited, so why not earn money while you are not in the screen? In this way you can add those earnings to your manual trading ones...  
  
I think one thing that is really laking on this EA is how to avoid the huge drawdowns caused by a sudden trend change or just a heavy trend continuation like in the following example:

But this kind of huge trends can be avoided by just using a higher TF indicator on the current TF, like for example a MTF Stochastic

And see then, how next week, after the momentum is fading and D1 stochastic is changing direction, how well it plays out after breaking R38 reaching out pivot...

As all indicators, of course are lagging and then, of course is going to filter good entries, however, I prefer to miss few trades than just hit the huge SL we have which may cause just loose the whole week of trading or even more if your account is small...  
  
You may think, ohg fuck, this trade is filtered...

It is possible to add a stop loss option to EA after a given number of pips. If we take transactions at 61 S / R most of the time EA will take TP, but if something goes wrong, we lose only 500 pips, with a lot of winnings the loss will not do anything for us. If we win 10x500 and lose 9x500, we are still 500 ahead

Every time you add the EA to a chart, you must change the magic number. If the EA is loaded to multiple charts and the magic number is the same, MT4 is not able to distinguish which trade is which, causing an error in opening trades. Also, did you follow akangaziz' instruction in this post [https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...4#post11142764](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=11142764#post11142764)

Arrived Home after work And this was the reason to my earlier post about system messages.  
  
I guess there has been an issue with the web re-direct?  
  
It opened up orders early on and then went and had a bit of a spaz out on this web request error code.  
  
Any ideas??

Hi MT4Forexinat, thanks for the offer to backtest, I am working with Aziz to organize how we proceed with backtest for selected members, as he does not want everyone to backtest at this stage. Will keep your offer in mind. Thanks again.

I think a good feature would be to have the "Time to start trading" and "Time to stop trading" in the settings so we set it from 23 to 1 or something to avoid big [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide").

Hi prodos, pls check [#Post 794](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=11291141#post11291141) for v0.7 EA download/installation instructions.  
  
Regarding the SET file, I am sure everyone is asking these 3 questions  
1\. Best pairs to trade  
2\. Best timeframe  
3\. Best SET file  
  
As we are still testing various settings and collecting results, I don't have the answers for these 3 questions yet, but hopefully soon (we are working on it).  
  
Keep testing the EA and share your results and settings. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

Hi M4ttc00p, thanks for asking this question. if you see "**WebRequest error code: 4000** " and "**WebRequest response code: 502** " errors in the Expert tab, you can **safely ignore** them, as they do not impact the core EA logic and all trades will be opened and closed as per normal.   
  
I see that you are still using the v0.51 version of the EA, I suggest you can upgrade to v0.7, see [#Post 794](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=11291141#post11291141) for more information. Green pips.

Ha, sure, as I said before, this EA is v0.7 (beta), it still has some bugs even though many FF members are reporting profits day after day -- if you are adventurous enough and not mind the downside of some unforeseen bugs, you are welcome to run it in real accounts (0.01 lot) but just don't bet your house on it yet.

If we take transactions at 61 S / R most of the time EA will take TP, but if something goes wrong, we lose only 500 pips, with a lot of winnings the loss will not do anything for us. If we win 10x500 and lose 9x500, we are still 500 ahead

Hi sartFX, at the moment the EA is blocked (on purpose) for backtest, please forward test it instead. Cheers.

Hi JamieA, I am not sure why, but please take a look at [#Post 794](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=11291141#post11291141), you don't need to put the "TDI-RT-Close-rAlgo" indi on the chart for the EA to work (as long as the indi file is in the Indicators folder).  
  
If the original "TDI-RT-Clone" indi works for you, sure, you can opt to put it on the chart. Cheers.

I was running both EA's just a mistake the 0.50 was only on one chart.  
  
I notice it is also trying to update pivot line each hour, is this necassary becasue it is only working off the Weekly Pivots and they shouldnt change for the week?  
  
What i'm saying is all these extra server messages that are sent off to the broker, gives the broker a heads up that you are using an EA and if anyone is not using a reputable broker they may try to spike some [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") and make you take on too many positions and can effect DD etc...  
  
Also I Use [IC markets](/brokers/ic-markets "View IC Markets Broker Profile") and if you get over 2000 server messages in a certain amount of time they want to suspend your account.   
  
Today I am not recieving the Web errors, trades have opened as normal again..   
  
But i think if the logic in the algo can be adjusted to only re-draw pivot line on a monday it may stop some of the brokers seeing you are running an EA  
  
Thanks for your time :-)

Hi sartFX, what kind of tick data quality do you have? If you can delivery 99.99% data modeling quality, we can figure out adding you on the backtester team. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

I think it would be a nice feature a button which enable users to let the cycle to finish and then pause the ea activity on that pair, mostly to help users during an update.  
  
thank you very much for the amazing work you are doing. I will let the demo go for another 2 months then if all is good I will go live, unless you think 0.7 is good to go live on a real account.

What i'm saying is all these extra server messages that are sent off to the broker, gives the broker a heads up that you are using an EA and if anyone is not using a reputable broker they may try to spike some spreads and make you take on too many positions and can effect DD etc...

Hi M4ttc00p, thanks for your suggestion, regarding redrawing of pivot lines, I am putting your feedback down on the feature request list for v0.8, we are tracking the bugs and feature requests seriously and working to improve the EA in the next iteration. Do keep the ideas and suggestions coming!

Thanks fabio.g, I am putting this suggestion down on the feature request list, however bear in mind that we might not be able to include all suggestions in the next EA release, since some more critical feature requests will get coding attention first.   
  
If you are comfortable with v0.7 performance so far, you can try it on a real account with 0.01 lots.

Hi guys. I hope you're all doing well today and have a great Wednesday!  
  
Could anyone explain to me why the EA opened EURCAD long in between Pivot and S38? Please see screenshots attached.  
  
Thanks!

This is my setting for EURCAD. I have each pair configured differently based on ADR (if ADR is ~50 it's not the same as a pair with ADR of 100).  
  
  
**EDIT - SOLVED** : Now I see the **Pips range for pivot is too big**. Should be 10 in this pair. Thank you Cescof didn't notice this before ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

No worries, please see the edit in my post 879. It was the "Pips range for pivot", since this pair's ADR is around 60-80 pips per day a 25 pip range is too big for the pivots. A smaller pip range based on ADR (how much price moves per day) will avoid opening trades too soon like the EURCAD one.  
  
I think:  
ADR 50-70 pip range for pivot should be 10-15  
ADR 100-120 pip range for pivot should be 20-25  
  
Need some testing.  
  
ADR can be seen with ADR_v2 indicator.

Hi vladi28, thanks for the suggestion, yes a Telegram group is likely on the cards, just need some thinking on this idea to ensure discussion/information is shared in the most efficient way. When we are ready to launch we the chat group we will announce it. Thanks again!

I was running previous versions for two weeks without a trade triggering, having even s/r 38 pivot available to trade, Auto trading is enabled, I have the smily face in the upper right, and have no error messages indicating there is any problem, I just have not been able to get a trade to trigger.

Thanks sartFX, unless you already have it, for backtest we recommend <https://tickstory.com/download-tickstory/> (Standard version), please don't purchase it yet as we are deciding on the backtest participant list, will be in touch with you (please do turn on private messages on your FF profile settings).  
  
Also, your question in #Post 889, regarding getting 99.9% tick data quality, here's an article might be of help: [https://tickstory.com/articles/metat...lling-quality/](https://tickstory.com/articles/metatrader-back-test-with-99-modelling-quality/)

Hi joefrombrook, do you think this issue is related/same as what @bohurst reported in [#Post 767](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=11288975#post11288975)? The Pivot Trading EA is yet to be coded for FIFO trading, perhaps in future releases. Thanks.

I had a set of EJ trades open up and they hit TP....and then the EA opened up another EJ set of trades, this time I had the martingale distance set to 10 pips and max of 5 trades. Price went against me and the EA never opened up any martingale trades at the 10 pip mark. With that being said price went against me around 65 pips and hit the SL set by the EA. Using Davits system, having a SL of 65 pips is toooo tight. When my SL was hit I was at the S100 pivot, which is still a valid entry pivot. I think that no matter what Pivot we "enter" our trade set at, we should always use the 138 pivot as our SL. This will allow us to "cast that big net" that Davit always talks about. We need to use that Pip distance between 38 (or 61 if that is where you enter) and 138 as our SL for our Lot Size calculation. That way we can decide how much we want to risk for each trade. This way we can use the standard formula for determining our desired Lot Size according to our percentage of account we want to use (standard 2% for example) and divide that by our SL (distance between lets say 61 and 138) and this will give us our desired Lot Size to use. We can then break that Lot Size down into 5 smaller trades or 10 smaller trades and this will give us our BIG NET that he speaks of, all while allowing our SL to be big enough to withstand moves against us.  
  
EDIT: With this example we can have a SL of 115 pips (random pip distance) and still enter on ALL important pivots (61, 78 and 100) and still only risk 2% of our account overall. It's all predetermined in our lot size calculation. This will allow is to cast the Big Net and break down our overall Lot Size into smaller trades all while covering ALL the major pivot points.

Am I the only person who got a lot as with EURJPY?  
  
EDIT: I just went back to look at my EJ trade. Price went down to the S100 pivot and stopped me out of my trade (65 pip SL) and then went back up and went all the way up to half way between S 61 and S38.....roughly 85+ pips. If we would have had 138 as our SL and entered the trade with small lots and allowed for price to go against us some (casting the big net) we could have added more smaller trades to the trade set once price went back in our favor and caught some of those 85+ pips and turned that Losing trade into a winning trade. This is exactly why we should make our SL 138 and enter at 61 and not 38. Start off with small lots and if price goes against us then we only lose a smaller amount......try to "add" to trades when going in our desired direction.

Hi cescof, thanks, I am putting this down in our feature request tracking sheet, the request will be up for consideration when Aziz works on the next iteration. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

Hi bojack34, yes last night EJ had a huge downward swing to S100 then it came back up within 5hrs back to S61-S38. However my EJ trades using v0.7 resulted in quite a huge profit using martingale 1.2, but I agree that's too much risk here (or lost opportunity for you) and the DD can be scary. I am putting your "casting big net" suggestion from #Post 897 and #Post 909 as a topic of discussion with Aziz. Green pips. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

However my EJ trades using v0.7 resulted in quite a huge profit using martingale 1.2, but I agree that's too much risk here (or lost opportunity for you) and the DD can be scary. I am putting your "casting big net" suggestion from #Post 897 and #Post 909 as a topic of discussion with Aziz. Green pips.

I should have noted in my posts that I was/am using v0.6. I'm glad to hear that V0.7 kept you in the trade and you were able to come out ahead. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Hi guys,  
  
I'm not really sure if this has been already proposed, if so... Let me do that again XD  
  
In the EA we should differentiate between what is Averaging up and Averaging down to the trade and also the different operations you want to setup for each kind of approach...  
  
If I understand correctly, now you can setup MAX number of trades and Martingale, when trade goes into profit it will start opening trades each +X Pips and when it goes against you it will then open position at the same number of pips until both reach the MAX number of trades, this will cause a situation (If you limit the MAX Trades) that when prices goes big against us, we can end up with a lot of positions opened near R38 but no more positions around R61 or higher levels which would mean a lot of drawdown that could be mitigated (from my point of view, you can proof if I'm wrong).  
  
So we have different approaches here...  
  
So for example, if price is going in our favour, we will be adding positions every 5 pips if all conditions still met under our MAX Number of trades, but if price is going against us, and let say EA defined SL at -100pips, we could have a MAX Number of trades for averaging down, and if for example this is setup at 4 trades, EA Could then open 4 trades at 20 pip distance so the last trade will be opened at -80pips, reducing the drawdown and also the total loss in case our trade is completely wrong.  
  
For me, the ideal situation is that EA will just wait when trade is going against us and only open new position when rules are met again before hitting SL, assuming that our first entry was not good but a higher pivot line will then act a S/R.  
  
Kind Regards,  
Jaime

Hi fellow pivot traders,  
  
I am having a problem with the EA where it does not create any Orders. I have uninstall-reinstall MT4 & the EA, Indicators several times but not to availability.  
  
I have followed the instructions provided, EA symbol show a Smily Face, Web Request URL already filled in, Pivot are shown successfully but the EA still shows no sign of any orders. Would appreciate if any advice to make this EA works on my MT4. Cheers

In regards to #3 on page one. It seems weird that you want all of us to participate as much as possible with back tests and sharing our ideas to make the EA as good as possible and you follow up with you reserve the rights to take the EA commercial, making all of us pay for it. What is the difference between the ALways free ea and the potential future commercial ea?

Hi bojack34, the backtest team consists of 5-6 members who volunteered to help. Backtest will start soon.  
  
Regarding taking the EA commercial (and "making all of us pay for it" as writen by you), please read #Post 1 FAQ again. What we meant is, **the stable version of this rPT-EA will always be free** , once the EA is confirmed to be profitable. After this project, Aziz is free to pursue developing other types or **variants** of the EA, and he will have no further obligation to make whatever he develops free -- **Except for this rPT-EA** , I believe you have no intention to expect Aziz to provide all other EAs he developed (or will be developing), for free, correct? You can tell what he has done so far, he has been very generous to the FF community.  
  
Hope this explains.  
  
\------------------------------------  
3\. Will this EA be forever free?  
My unwavering intention is to develop the EA to be consistently profitable and stable, and **the stable version will _always_ remain free**. However as an Algorithmic-Trading Programmer, I retain the rights to work on other **variants** of the rPTEA, and will decide to go commercial, or not."

Ok I must have misread/misunderstood. I thought that he was talking about the EA that we are all forward testing and back testing. That he reserved the right to make it commercial and then sell it to us. Sorry for the misunderstanding.

I would recommend doesnt use the indicator _TDI-RT-Clone-rAlgo_ on the chart, because it requires a lot of computing power from the PC.  
The PC is therefore very lame. It is sufficient if the Indi is only in the indicator folder.

You put ea on 4h chart, and use options exit /entry 15/30/60/240

Ok txs, I wasn’t aware that what TF the EA was loaded on made a difference. I thought the input was the only thing that mattered

Hi armaros, thanks for asking, for now there is no plan to remove the Skycode Webrequests, you can refer to Post 1 for more information. Feel free to reach out to me if you have more questions.

Hi prodos, v0.6 might be choppy on results, but if you run the EA over a longer period of time and be **patient,** you will see better results. You should use H4 and default settings.  
  
Also you can try v0.7 too, see Post 1. Green pips. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

This will be what I am forward testing for the weeks to come. I will test this until there is a new updated version of the EA released. I'm not sure about the "max risk in percentage of balance". I'm not sure how many pairs I should be trading with this input set this low. I am going for a slightly less aggressive approach.  
  
EDIT: I decide to NOT trade pivot 38 since Davit does not include that pivot on his initial set of rules. It starts out a 61. I know that he personally DOES trade 38 but that comes with more experience and a level of discrepancy, which I believe is hard for an EA to achieve. I don't like that my SL will now be 161 but I do believe that is better than it only being 2 pivot lines away.

Hi bojack34, I think you can adjust the "max risk in percentage of balance" to mimic Davit's method of SL. As your account grow you can adjust that settings too. It's already on the Feature Request tracking sheet that we should add an absolute SL $ setting, and Aziz will decide to add this feature or not.  
  
We are starting backtest of the EA soon, and the question of whether to take trades at pivot 38, will soon be supported by backtest data (yes, backtest is not perfect, but at least it brings us closer to the "answer" zone on those questions we have in our mind).  
  
Green pips! 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

How many pairs r you running and what time frame r you using default set files. What is the TP value is 1000 pips or 100 pips. Pls share you set files  
  
I was running more than 5 hours no trade got opened. I used default setting in all JPY and AUD pairs in M15 time

For backrest I'm ready if you want. And I suggest to test filter with angle as is one of the main safety criteria for Davit s pivot strategy. Seems nobody using it here(me too) but I suppose could be a real boost to avoid dd

FYI: Do date, with ten years Forex experience, I've never seen an EA work successfully yet. Though I wish to see one work, I haven't as of yet.

Thank you DiamondMiner, so far the EA is looks promising as people are reporting positive results, however it's still in v0.7 beta so it's not bug-free or contains all the features people are requesting, but we are working on it.  
  
We just keep pushing the envelope and see where this effort lead us to, you are welcome to test the EA (see Post 1) and share with us your comments. Appreciate your 10-year experience as a Forex trader.  
  
BTW, the Backtest team is formed and backtest will be starting early next week, will share the results once we collate them. Green pips. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

If you had bothered to read at least the last 10 pages of this thread you would have found that those exit/entry options are available only in v0.6 and they were removed in v0.7, which can be seen in the changelog.

Yes, I read that post, but I thought that bohurst was not able to exit trades, but did not have a problem entering trades.... for me i can not even get an entry to trigger, so I dont think FIFO would be a factor?

let's not forget, any fund is probably using someone else's money, not theirs. I prefer using the Davit trading method manually, I do not have any problem staying in the black ink.

it's a private fund meaning you can't invest with them, with an average ROI of 25% a year since 30 years I think they invest their own money by now.

As children we all make a lot of mistakes, then as we become adults we learn and tend not to make as many, then again as we becomes senior citizens a lot of mistakes tend to reoccur.  
I learned a long time ago that I would never be anywhere close to perfect.Unlike you Mr.Perfect.In the short time you were with Davit I see you were quick to pick up on his degrading and   
disrespectful insults and arrogance.If anything you do you need to learn to respect other people Mr. Perfect!

almost all major pairs in [Tickmill](/brokers/tickmill "View Tickmill Broker Profile"). don't do that with big money.

what are you saying is about extend pips distance if a trend is strong and against u. from the default setting pips distance (ex: 10pips) to a bigger value. yes, it can save the account from big drawdown, but still, u can't find a way to exit if strong is continue.

5-digit broker. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

Hi DiamondMiner, thanks for your comments, if you read Post 1 we briefly touched on the fact that there are both advantages and disadvantages of Manual vs EA trading methodologies -- each trader can define/decide which trading style suit them best.  
  
If trading Davit's method manually works best for you, yes, and no one else should dispute that, but if you ever decide to use this EA, you are welcome too. Green pips. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

With Profit Factor 2.04, still a respectable performance!  
  
Once again, let's remember that this ea is NOT the Holy Grail that everyone is looking for, so you should not expect your profit/equity curve will grow exponentially, however increasingly we are confident that over the long run, this EA will generate some consistent profits as we inch closer to v1.0.  
  
Green pips! 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

Please use H4 TF please, and trades are only opened when there is TDI cross at the SR38/61/78/100 levels, so the EA does not trade at regular frequency. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

How/where do you choose options to entry /exit on 15/30/60/240? Do you trade manually? As the EA is attached on 4HR chart, the EA only open orders every 4HRs or by pipesteps and exit trades when targets are reached.

Hi again, I'm just trying to figure out if this ea will work on US based accounts. I have had different versions of the ea running for most of the last 3-4 weeks and not been able to have a single trade trigger. I'm not getting any errors, autotrading is turned on and I have plenty of experience using EA's, but I'm just not sure if for some reason this EA will not work with a US based account (I'm running it on [Oanda](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile") and [Forex.com](/brokers/forexcom "View FOREX.com Broker Profile") so far). It has been suggested that possibly FIFO rules are preventing it from working, but I think that perhaps that would only be a factor once an initial position is opened? But really I'm just curious if anyone with a us based account has been able to run this EA. Thanks in advance for a response!

> Hi again, I'm just trying to figure out if this ea will work on US based accounts. I have had different versions of the ea running for most of the last 3-4 weeks and not been able to have a single trade trigger. I'm not getting any errors, autotrading is turned on and I have plenty of experience using EA's, but I'm just not sure if for some reason this EA will not work with a US based account (I'm running it on Oanda and Forex.com so far).

This is a known v0.7 bug that the pivot lines are either (1) not showing at all or (2) not showing correctly, the way to fix it is to restart the MT4 terminal. However even if the lines are displayed incorrectly on the chart, it does NOT affect the correct operation of the EA (ie. the trades will still be triggered at the right S/R levels and TDI crosses).

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

if you are using v0.7, you can change the timeframe to 1 min(the pairs reach r38,s38...)，it will open a trade soon, if still not open a trade, maybe you didn't set correctly.today v0.7 open NJ, AC, UC

for me, it is real account, as mentioned before. since v0.6 i use real account for fwd test.  
  
just a small amount to test.  
profit or loss, not a big deal.

if you are interested on floating loss, there is always a small amount, between 1-5% not a big deal.

The tests are made with identical settings***** on both 0.5 and 0.7 versions. The results are better with 0.5 for the time being.  
  
***** Differences are: missing exit on tdi cross and close all trades after x hours for the 0.5 version

Running 1.2.10, with the URL in options, in D1 TF only.  
  
Some nights the EA finds trade setups and holds them in the queue until they hit (as one would expect), other days (like today), it finds setups, but cancels them a minute later, not five (300 seconds). Is this expected? Are there input variables that control this? Should ReplaceOrder be false?

Hi oradba, thanks for your post however I am not sure if you have posted at the right thread, in this thread the EA version is at v0.7, there is no "1.2.10". I am not aware there is a "ReplaceOrder" in the EA. Please read [Post 1](https://goo.gl/nN2Bdb) of this thread if you are interested to find out more about the Pivot Trading EA. Green pips. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

![File Type: mq4](https://assets.faireconomy.media/images/attach/mq4.gif) [Scaling script v1.2.mq4](/attachment/file/2922620?d=1533109358) 8 KB | 432 downloads 

  
This is a script, copy to MT4 - MQL4 - Scripts  
  
For BUY  
drag the script under the price = x buy limit orders at x pips  
drag the script over the price = x buy stop orders at x pips  
  
For SELL  
drag the script under the price = x sell limit orders at x pips  
drag the script over the price = x sell stop orders at x pips  
  
So you can pyramid profit or use martingale.  
For automated trading i do not use martingale, i use martingale for manual trading, **50** pips distance rather then 5.

Hello all. Below are the trades taken so far by this robot. I am using version 0.7 with default settings except for target pips. I ran the robot for 8 days so far (from July 23) in 4 pairs (EURUSD, USDCHF, GBPUSD and USDJPY). The performance is great! Thanks Akangaziz. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Thank you so much for developing this tool. The plan is to test for still 1 month and then live with 100$ and 0.01 on 10 pairs.  
  
In my home work has to be paid sooner or later, so i will give back some profits to akangaziz. He also can see my balance and track my gains, so i cannot hide.   
  
Aziz which is the status of the ea? I mean, is there still any bug? Do you plan to implement new features?

10 pairs with 100$ balance will most probably result in a margin call and/or account bust

I have had different versions of the ea running for most of the last 3-4 weeks and not been able to have a single trade trigger. I'm not getting any errors, autotrading is turned on and I have plenty of experience using EA's, but I'm just not sure if for some reason this EA will not work with a US based account (I'm running it on Oanda and Forex.com so far). It has been suggested that possibly FIFO rules are preventing it from working, but I think that perhaps that...

I also had that FIFO problem with [OANDA](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile")\- it won't work! I am in the process of opening anew account with FinPro in Europe.

Hello all. I think this is a wrong entry. V0.7 opened trades on the pivot, though all six trades in total are positive. Is this a bug in the robot?

Hi SergsPogi, thanks for your feedback. If you check the comment section of the first trade of this group of trades, it should say R78 or R100, which means the EA triggered the first trade at that Resistance level. As to why the lines are incorrectly drawn, **this is a known bug** that the pivot lines are either (1) not showing at all or (2) not showing correctly, the way to fix it is to restart the MT4 terminal. **However even if the lines are displayed incorrectly on the chart, it does NOT affect the correct operation of the EA (ie. the trades will still be triggered at the right S/R levels and TDI crosses).**  
  
Do take a read of the [Installation Guide with FAQs](https://goo.gl/RSSjcE) if you have any other questions, lastly, please join our [Telegram chat](https://goo.gl/JxwhEF) (more than 200 members there) to get more info/updates/discuss with other traders who are testing the EA.  
  
Hope this helps. Green pips.

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

yesterday's result. I exit earlier, close all floating profit around 210 pips. in total i get 350 pips yesterday.  
today and tomorrow we'll have some red news.  
  
be careful if you still have floating trades, exit while you profit.

The news filter its a must, i know it is on the list, till then maybe you should put 2-3 manual Stop Intervals from 23.59 to 00.59 (spread high) , from 14.30 to 16.30 (US news) , etc

""we are working on better SL"" ""red news""  
  
When in profit, lets say +100 pips put break even at +90 pips and let it run (with trailing or without trailing). On the red news set break even at whatever profit - 5 pips and let it run. If there is not enough room for those 5 pips, close the trades.  
  
I use this approach all the time from a long time and the reward is great especially on the red news time.  
We will lose (from profit) 5 pips vs limitless gain.

As far as it seen i didnt see any bug report for last 4 pages. so it means this EA is pretty stable version.

Not a good idea, i have open positions on GU with a drawdown bigger then your planned plan ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) Try 1000$, at least.

There are still some bugs (see FAQ section of the [EA installation guide](https://goo.gl/RSSjcE)), and a few features are still missing (eg. news filter), and the SL exit is still non-ideal.   
  
But yes, the EA is still making serious pips, as reported by many many testers, in spite of these shortcomings.

Where can I find the pivot trading indicator that you are using? Just the indicator for manual trading

I got the TDI clone in the indicator folder and the EA in the Experts folder and attached it to the chart. And followed as much as I could. But somehow it didn't open any trades today and yesterday.   
No errors though.  
  
Is it something I'm missing or was there simply no signal?

Hi Rainy88, on Fridays it's good to close the trades if you are in profit, otherwise, you can choose to do nothing.  
  
The EA is designed NOT to trigger any NEW trades on Fridays as it readies for a new set of weekly pivots on the coming Monday, however, the EA can/will trigger trades on Friday if there are existing floating trades from previous few days.  
  
Hope this explains.

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

Hi tzic, this thread is for EA robot trading, for manual trading, please visit Davit's thread <https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=588764>, you will be able to find all relevant resources there. Green pips. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

See [EA Installation Guide](https://goo.gl/RSSjcE) for more information.  
  
In it, FAQ question 3 says:  
3\. I have Smiley Face icon on my chart, but why there are no trades opened?  
Smiley Face means the rPT-EA is running, however the EA is not designed to trade at regular intervals, instead, depending on which Pivot levels the price is hovering at AND if there is TDI cross (below the “**TDI Maximum for BUY** ” number and above the “**TDI Minimum for SELL** ” number) , only then a buy/sell trade will be executed. Also, the EA is designed NOT to trigger any NEW trades on Fridays as it readies for a new set of pivots on the coming Monday, however, the EA can/will trigger trades on Friday if there are existing floating trades from previous few days. **Be patient.**  
  
Hope this helps, and green pips to you.

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

Thank you WindChaser you were superclear, what do you and Akangaziz suggest to do with losing positions on friday? Close them or carry them to the next week?

Hi zzz18, I am sorry to learn that your experience with this EA has not been good. This is interesting as we have received many positive results from many testers this week. May I know how long have you been running the EA, which pairs you traded and the starting account size? [ https://goo.gl/RSSjcE](https://goo.gl/RSSjcE) is the EA Installation Guide with FAQs if you want to revisit.  
  
Below is the Balance graph of my DEMO trading this week (14 pairs), it's a TEST martingale set of 1.2, lot size 0.1. Tests are still ongoing so I am not able to conclude if on longer term this EA based on Davit's strategy, would work or not. We'll see.  
  
I wish you green pips.

Hi  
May I suggest something if not already been done!  
As the consecutive wins are 9 and consecutive losses 3 this indicate a good entry criteria in first place and so a good expectancy.  
If so, why not using positive and negative martingale?  
For example: R:R of 1:2  
First trade: 0.01 lot and you win  
Second trade: use the total profit from above to trade. If it's a win you have nice profit. If it's a loose you didn't loss anything of your initial balance.  
Third trade: in case you have a loss start from first step.  
4 trade: martingale to recover the previous loss. 2*0.01 lot  
Etc....  
Mainly if win you use just ones your total profit on next trade.  
If loose, you martingale initial lot size etc...

I think 1 week only is a tremendously insufficient time to evaluate a trading system EA.

Been there done that, not a good call. Best thing to do is to close all trades manually when in profit, and this is truly the best thing to do in this stage. Martingale thingy (especially with multiplying lots) is a bi..ch. My opinion. 

Don't NO-SL and drive! And remember: Always keep your eyes on the trend!

I agree. IMHO At least 6 months in demo/real, backtest in 8-10 years and then two years with certified and verified Myfxbook real account. 

Discipline and winning attitude

There shouldn’t be a martingale on this ea, only a re-entry at the next pivot if need be. Adding to winning trades would be acceptable.

Hi zzz18,  
  
1\. Testing using real money is not recommended at the moment since the EA is still in v0.7 beta  
2\. If you decide to use real money for testing, please follow our recommendation in the [EA Installation Guide](https://goo.gl/RSSjcE)  
  
Green pips,  
WindChaser  
  
\-------------------------------------  
FAQ 6 it says:  
  
6\. How many pairs can I trade if my starting account balance is only $100?  
We recommend you start with at least **$300** in your account.  
  
**For Account Balance $300, trade maximum 3 pairs****,** use 0.01 lot size with Martingale 1.0, “**profit in pips to start adding volume** ”: 10, “**close all trades after x hour** ”: 24, adjust down the “**profit in pips to close all trades** ” settings to **100** , max opened trade 5.  
  
For Account Balance $1000, trade maximum 10 pairs, use 0.01 lot size with Martingale 1.0, “**profit in pips to start adding volume** ”: 10, “**close all trades after x hour** ”: 72.  
  
You should also disable the Martingale setting if you determine that in bigger timeframe the trend is too strong.

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

Great advice WC!! I really hope you and Az remove the martingale input and just add to the code that the EA ONLY enters orders at the pivot points. If we enter price at 61 and price continues to go against us, we then will only add more trades at the next pivot (which would be 78). The only time we are "adding" to our positions is when price is going in our desired direction.....ie "stacking". This will allow us to ONLY trade at the pivot point and not "martingale" trades in the middle of 2 Pivots. I know you have heard this argument from me before. I apologize for my redundancy ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1) Keep up the good work my friend!!

Hi Buddakarn, for this question please check with the person who said that to you, or visit Davit’s thread to seek clarification there. Thanks. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

many Thanks.

i know I’m not WC but, if it were me I would look at the calendar at the beginning of each week and look for 3 pairs that have an adr20 of less than 100 and are not going to be effected by any big news releases that week. I would Start with the recommended pairs from Davits thread and narrow down those pairs.

Thanks bojack, that does make complete sence, also just thought of a post that Davit made that all ways sticks in my head -  
  
"Here is a tip to new traders  
Best easiest pairs to trade are commodity pairs against each other  
NZD CAD AUD  
All pretty much stay in range.Rarely go to extremes and often worth holding even if you are in reasonable DD  
I made shitload of money trading AC NC this year.  
Once you take USD out of it then main factors are prices of commodities. Oil goes up CAD gets strong, dairy up NZD strong,Iron ore up AUD up in basic terms and rest is technical where they are on the charts "

Hi Arjun, please read Post 1 and the EA installation document. Backtest is not allowed at the moment. Thanks. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

Hi guys,  
As i have setted up the ea, it hasn't took any trade yet but i hope it will because of smiley face ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1). The question is that, you can see on screenshot that the pivot and support resistance lines are only drawn on one pair i.e eur/gbp but as on other 5 pairs the smiley face is there but with no support and resistance lines? Whats this issue is this EA working correctly with my system?? Thanks guys

Arjun please read the [EA Installation Guide](https://goo.gl/RSSjcE), the answers for your questions can be found in the FAQ section. Thanks.

I have tested something new. I do not want to modify the strategy but this information may help the testing team.  
  
I remove the use of pivots completely to reduce lag as much as possible. Something like TMS i think.  
But the trades are taken **only towards the Central Pivot**.  
  
Other rules:  
H4  
TDI 60/40  
**Angleator** from M5 to H1 need to be **minimal neutral** (black) / no arrows showing contrarian colors, if some confirm red for sell, green for buy, better.  
Martingale on, 1 (not a fan just testing)  
distance between trades 5 pips  
max 10 open orders  
close all trades if TDI crossing, false  
TP 100 pips SL 1000 pips (need better exit rules)

time of trading, 1 week, nonstop  
profit factor, 10 times bigger than with use of pivots 

Don't NO-SL and drive! And remember: Always keep your eyes on the trend!

hi! newbie here... what is the meaning of TDI maximum for buy 40 and TDI minimum for SELL 60? is it the level? does it mean, it will trigger the BUY maximum if the TDI is not greater than 40 level and it will trigger SELLL minimum if TDI is no less than 60 level? is that it? because i understand it this way?

Sorry if I ask, but I didn't understand when you say "I remove the use of pivots completely to reduce lag as much as possible. Something like TMS i think.  
But the trades are taken **only towards the Central Pivot**.".  
Are you testing the same EA or something new? In the first case, how can I configure the actual EA with the right settings to obtain the same behaviour?  
Thank you very much.

My USDJPY trades using v0.7 from last week. I did not intervene with the robot even with news. When I checked this morning, all the open trades were gone. When I checked the Account History, all were positive!!! Hmmm... this works like magic. Great stuff, Akangaziz. Thanks buddy.

I had thought that FIFO rules would interfere with closing trades, but should it affect trade entry? It does not make sense to me?

The script, in fact a fully functional program with graphic interface, is able to see mt4 GUI (arrows, lines, colors, etc), is able to see inside log.files and with this combined informations is putting orders, close orders, even trail orders, after a predetermined logic.  
  
AutoIt is a Basic-like scripting language designed for automating pretty much everything you see on the screen. It works perfectly with mt4.

It only interferes with closing trades. This only happens with U.S. brokers because of the Dodd-Franks law. First trade open is the first trade closed.

If anyone else has trouble with the Pivot levels not displaying correctly, after you checked all magic numbers. Just go and remove EA click on every Chart time frame for the pair that is not displaying "Wait to Load Chart " Should appear, MT Just hasn't downloaded all your history correctly.  
  
Once that has happened re-load the EA and problem should be solved

I live in Canada and brokers and FX law's aren't very retailer's friendly. I'am with an Aussie broker, for 6 months now, Global Prime, and I'm very pleased with them.

It seems MT4 must be restarted every week to show the pivot levels correctly. Is that correct, Windchaser? I think this can be easily resolved without the need to restart MT4 by using something like EventSetTimer along with ObjectMove to move the pivot lines to the right places at the beginning of the week.

Hi montego, my personal preference are USDCAD, EURGBP, AUDJPY. Green pips. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

Good for you, Nomenix. For strategies/tools you can't/choose not to share, maybe it's best that **we should not even mention** about them so that others will not keep asking you to share, that's my humble suggestion.  
  
Also, best to start a separate new thread if you wish to discuss more about your AutoIt tool/strategy. Green pips. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

AUDCAD running more than 100pips, but setting for EA is still 100pips to close trades.  
Any help why this is happening?  
  
Am I to close it manually?

Please see [EA Installation Guide](https://goo.gl/RSSjcE) document, FAQ 16. You can decide to intervene manually or just let the EA do its job. Green pips.  
  
16\. What are the typical Stop Loss (SL) or Target Profit (TP) values?  
SL example: Entry Buy at S61, SL at S161 (that’s 100%)  
TP example: Entry Buy at S61, TP at weekly pivot line, but usually trade will close after "**profit in pips to close all trades** " setting is reached.

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

Correct, i wont mention anymore about tools that i cannot share, and strategies/results i cannot talk about without referring to tools that aren't free.

Hi Legge, please check FAQ 15 of the [EA Installation Guide](https://goo.gl/RSSjcE) for "Big Candle" explanation.

Hi ginotv25, please refer to **Step 3d** of the [EA Installation Guide](https://goo.gl/RSSjcE) if it still not working, you can contact me @UltimateCharm on Telegram. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

No, 80 pips in 4 digits.  
If 5 digits broker become 800 pips or 800 points.

Not sure if it is a problem with my setup or if this is with everyone using ea, but I have large difference b/w pivots on usdcad according to ea versus where they are on my davit template (which corresponds to pivots on various websites including [https://www.actionforex.com/markets/...-pivot-points/](https://www.actionforex.com/markets/pivot-points/fibonacci-pivot-points/) .  
  
most of the pairs on the ea have pivots that more or less line up with my template, but the pivot for usdcad on ea is 1.3088, while the pivot on my template is 60 pips lower at 1.3016. This is a huge disparity and should be addressed? Again, maybe I am overlooking something. Davit always said a few pips does not make a difference, but for something this large, the s1 on the ea is still above the weekly pivot.  
  
maybe there is some other reason that I do not have proper pivots shown on ea.

EA wont understand fundamental, it's just based on pivot line, don't expect its gonna survive in a long time period , for me I will avoid from buying GBP due to its critical economic condition, but this EA wont stop opening a new GBP cross pair , in this situation it's better for us to pray ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f64f.png?v=15.1) or close account with a loss . 

1 simple mistake makes you become 1000x better.

Im testing settings on 2 demo accounts. Both accounts have 6 same pairs and max open trades set to 3. One account has martingale enabled and one does not. Both accounts had placed 3 trades with audusd and closed in profits. Now regarding gbpusd, account with martingale has 3 orders and one without has 1 order. Can someone explain or point out the post where it explain how martingale works. As i thought with martingale turned off, the audusd would only have 1 order.

Martingale is about adding more lotsize. Not about number of trades.  
  
So it starts with 0.01 lot size, then 0.02, 0.04, etc. (depending on your settings.)

Thanks but at my end its effecting the number of orders as well. As i wrote, only 1 gbpusd order was taken on the account where it was off. One it was on, it took 3 orders.

Having any GBP crosses right now is a bad Idea...at least until bretix is over.

Friends explain please, EA default settings for 4-digit quotes ??? or for 5-digit?.... I did not understand ..... 80 pips a large body for exit, and at the same time "profit in pips to close all trades" - 1000 pips. How so?  
  
Appositely, look at the drawdown akangaziz....

Windchaser I am having a problem here manual trading. I entered this AU chart, but it doesn't show on the chart as an open trade. What could I have done wrong?

big trend for GBP and news release NZD BNZ Rate Statement kill my account today.  
  
lesson learned:  
  
1\. money management: better to use big pips distance and max trade to 5.  
2\. suggest having no trade at S38/R38, S100/R100.  
3\. in v0.8, need to handle/fix big SL size and possible to have a trailing feature (need to test it).  
  
experience increase quality, every mistake is a lesson..  
lucky me, I still not use big money yet for EA.. I still can fail 10 times with the same amount ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

I've already asked this question once, but got no reply, so here it is again.  
  
Hello Guy's,  
  
Can I ask why the EA is taking trades on pairs not recommended in the original strategy?

You should use Davit’s pairs yes, however since this is beta EA testing so feel free to put the EA in any pairs as test, using Demo money. Thanks. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

No they do work just like the ones Davit quoted, just some are more volatile and have a chance of moving against you quickly.  
  
its up to individual preferences in the end

Me personally am only using 4 pairs and yes they are the original ones from Davit. But I have tested a range of them on my Demo, and they all have the good and bad days

Hi  
What would you recommend the bigger pip distance to be and can this change be made on the EA input page or will you have to build this in to your next update?  
Thank you

It's a good approach to improve performance for next releases. Good job.  
IMHO, I think just few valid indicators are enough, otherwise the strategy could becomes complex and difficult to manage with worse results than expected.  
I don't understand the logic of martingala when set to ON: isn't it better to use an antimartingala approach? I mean, collecting new orders after PA convalidates the bounce in the right direction (toward pivot or opposite zone)?  
Thank you very much in advance.

Martingale will always blow an account sooner or later, it's a no go.  
  
I don't understand the logic of martingala when set to ON <== while scaling in, Martingale means if after the first entry of say 1 lot, price falls back say, 10 pips, you double up to say 2 lots and if it falls back another 10 pips, you double again to 4 lots and so on. Until the account either boom or bbust.

I agree. I would accumulate/increment new orders only if following the swing in the direction I expect. It's hard but not impossible. Otherwise martingala is very dangerous.

They are trying to develop an algo which is very different to manual trading as we've also found out over the last 3 years, ours would blow up your account too but trading our system manually doesn't, go figure. Why don't you just leave people alone and get on with your own trading because I've been around here long enough to know you can't trade for shit.

Any type of trading can blow up a live account if you don't have correct Money Management....  
  
All Akangaziz has shown is not to trade too many pairs and open up too many positions with a small size account which cant sustain DD.  
  
My DD was at 3.5% at its worst I hedged my account and closed out just under BE. On a $5000 account 3.5% is not bad and that was with 2 pairs ( normally risking 2% per pair is my limit )  
  
If you do not know how to manage your own money, you certainly should not rely on an EA...  
  
There are things you can do to minimize DD like I had NZD JPY open up some Buy orders with the EA and because of this I managed my DD with placing a manual Buy order on AUD NZD which helped offset.. It will never be a set and forget solution so keep an eye on everything

I am amazed there are so little talks/solutions about MM. **The strategy is good the Ea is good** , the MM is bad. The logical action is to put little effort and try different settings on MM. Try to change "maxim risk in percentange of balance" from 80 to something less. Forget about manual trading style where we can intervene at any moment to manage/stop bad trades, this is (Sparta) automatic trading, **we need to reduce risk** at minimum. We also need maxim risk in pips or money.  
  
GBP and NZD pairs were a nightmare and created many looses.  
This was the worst week in months, but all trades are closed now and i am still in profit. Also observe DD.

Lets be honest, after month of good trades we start to behave that we found holly grail of Forex. But Forex fight back and thats that. I understending this as a learning curve. Also I blown my real account. Reason for that is bad lack (read: greed), GBPUSD & NZDJPY pairs and my idiotic hedging...

You have good point about the MM. Over the years I have seen a number of persons blow their account with EA. Not because the EA overall perform bad but because of greed: The EA seems to work fine and then they increase the lot size and then blow their account when the marked change. What I think It's strange is that these persons seems to know MM very well. Is it lack of experience that make them make this mistake?

In the most part is the lack of experience (been there) and the rest are driven by greed and overconfidence (work hard to no go there)  
The pit may also contain: stupidity, lack of elementary logic, lack of common sense, gambling.

What I'm amazed guys is that you all jumped real accounts with an EA in development phase that has almost 0 MM...  
  
And instead of testing, providing feedback and solutions to current issues, the only thing I have seen here is people just going live and claiming awesome results after 1 week of testing...  
  
I know this EA has potential, but it also has a lot of work to be done... And definetly was not and is not ready to go live.

I agree with you 100%. I've coded an EA too and run it for the last week and the results are not very good.

ShortEntryCondition = ????  
  
  
  
Entry orders  
  
\-- Long entry  
if LongEntryCondition is true {  
if No position is open then Buy on open at Market/stop or limit?;  
Stop Loss = xxx pips?;  
Profit Target = xxxpips?;  
  
// Move SL to BE (on close)  
Move Stop Loss to Entry price when in profit at least xxx pips?;  
  
// Profit trailing (on close)  
Profit Trailing by (xxx * ATR(18)) pips?;

Thanks for your offer, but it's a multipair EA and it's a straight forward coding job.

johnsun888, please respect the topic of the thread, anything unrelated to development/testing of the rAlgo Pivot Trading EA, should not be posted here. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

Hi Emerald2112, yes the rPT EA can work by opening at S61 and close at S38 via TD crossed. v0.8 is under development and we strive to address the SL problem and better MM, stay tuned. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

Thanks for sharing Rainy88, last week was bad for rPT EA, we also found a new bug in v0.7 regarding the "big candle" Stop Loss logic. The v0.7 EA has no problem making pips, but the SL/MM will need to be strengthened otherwise in it will not stand up to strong trends (like the ones we saw last week in GBP and NZD pairs).  
  
All, as mentioned many times, please feel free to test the v0.7 (or v0.8 in time to come) in DEMO accounts -- if Tesla were to release a **v0.7** self-driving car for testing, we certainly will not want to put our kids in the car before it's certified to be road-worthy. Same for this EA, please use DEMO money so that you will not experience unnecessary monetary losses.  
  
We are working on v0.8 and aim to address the majority of the SL/MM issues reported. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

Hi there,  
Anybody got orders on AU from yesterday?  
It seems that the TDI crossed against the orders but the EA did not close the orders.  
  
Is it a mistake?

Mine too, but what I meant is about a condition in the EA, that says, if TDI crossed against trade, close order. Shouldn't they EA have closed the order? It crossed on the H4 chart.

Kodos to you Akangaziz and WindChaser for your outstanding work. I was hoping that someone like you two would be able to simulate by EA anything close to Davit's great work in Professional Forex Trading. Also, hopefully oneday you all will integrate fundamentals as well. I was actually thinking of learning MT4 coding to try to do the same... but, it would take to long for me to learn coding despite my background in C language..

Thank you for your help my friends. This EA seems to be working well, but I will closely monitor and manually close as needed for large DDs that will trigger a Margin Call !

I am just using the standard settings by the authors or creators here. I may use the H1 for faster entries, then switch over to H4 for maintenance to avoid the Red News spikes during the LO. NYO or AO, in the opposite direction - except with any major tend reversal or RT or at the 78-100% or already 100 pips I will get out...my momma told me not to be greedy also ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1) But any 50-100 Pips is likely to have a reversal depending on the pair, thus manually closing to keep my Pips...or taking more trades on a PB.  
  
Nevertheless, as many experts say, it is easy to make Pips, but it is keeping your Pips what is most important.  
  
Regards,  
John

Hi imichaeli, you can take a screenshot of the chart and send us the Experts log file to { email address deleted by staff } so that we can take a look. Or otherwise, please wait for v0.8 (with major bug fixes soon) and start your test from there. Thanks. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

@akangaziz  
GBPCHF Trade, with this setting the EA should increase the value after 10 pips in plus. He didn't do that. Do you have an explanation?

no, not exactly. The 2nd trade wasn't opened at 10 pips profit for you. But the 3. and 4. trade yes.  
What is your setting?

For V0.51, is it on H1 or H4 to confirm?   
  
Looks like V0.51 is better to succeed in a strong momentum trend.

Hi WindChaser  
Thanks for directing us to this EA Installation Guide. I did installed v.05, v.06 and v.07 and didn't seem to get a picture of what was really happening - sometimes in money - sometimes out of money. I didn't want to bother the developers with numerous and possibly unnecessary questions and decided to give it a little break.  
  
The Installation guide have answered almost all my questions and I'm going to reinstall. I suggest it should be put together as a companion guide and good reference when the final version is released. Meantime, I'm looking forward to v.08. At least now with the Guide, I can understand when things go wrong.  
  
Thanks to you all for your patience and efforts in helping everyone.

This EA works well on range market, but when the market is in trend, it will add lots as the price moves.I think there must be a solution to this situation, or it will not work.

This Pivot EA uses TDI indicator's RSI price and Signal line cross to open orders, I think pivot line is not so useful in trending market.So it seems like we can only use TDI indicator.

I'm finding this system too risky. It has been operating on the EURJPY H4 pair since yesterday, the price has gone from the pivot point and has risen to R100 where several sales orders have been opened, it kept going up and is close to R138 where it opened more sales orders, let's see if by tomorrow it will reverse . Otherwise, this EA is totally discarded.

Hi northedan, yes, the v0.7 is not good for trending markets. v0.8 will be released in the next two weeks and you can test again.  
  
You should decide to discard the EA or not, once it reaches v1.0, that's the stable version, otherwise, discarding an EA during its developmental stage v0.7, v0.8, etc, might be too hasty a decision. Of course, the decision is all yours and no one should argue.  
  
For v0.7, best to turn off trading at S/R 38 levels, and keep the “**pips Range for pivot (could be 0-20pips)** ” value small (0-5), and “**max opened trades** ” setting to 5.

Green pips. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

Hi WindChaser, I think maybe you can consider the pivot point changed direction as the trend direction,and use it as stop loss decision.Sorry for my bad English.Green pips!

To help with the EA, you should post also what pairs and settings you are trading. Simply posting results do not help anything in improvement.

Here are the pairs I'm trading. All default settings,H4. Currently in a DD, but somehow I think it will recover. Will keep posted. Want to test to extremes.

I have some question about exit filter:  
1) how does candle body size work?  
2) TDI crossing: I have tried the EA on H1 TF and got crossing but not close the positions. If I use the EA on H1 then the crossing would be on H1 too, right?  
3) x hours as long as profit: if the basket is in profit and the first trade was opened 72 hours ago the EA is closing the full basket?  
  
Thanks for help guys.  
  
I would be grateful for some setup sharing.

I am in that position right now with EURGBP and EURJPY. I am trading on H4 timeframe. However, when one inspects the daily timeframe, one can see that it is still trading in a range; so patience and fortitude are key here, I think, for the best result.

I apologize for the EURGBP chart above; it does not, on the face of it, support my point; but that is because the MT4 screenshot is too narrow. Here is one with my OS screenshot.

Hi oradba, good to know last week was a good week for you. If the markets are not trending strongly v0.7 works wonders, however be warned in a strong trend (GBP or NZD in the past 1 month) the EA could also bust your account. Don't go live until we could address this issue in later releases of the EA. Green pips. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

Yes, I am currently carrying EURGBP and EURJPY from last week, and it isn't pretty. Waiting for the Mexcian reworking of NAFTA to be announced to reinforce USD as a safe haven currency.

If the system is continuously profitable in any situation, then the author can loan from bank, and make many many money.A profitable system is very hard to construct, but it does exist.

Its only demo and just letting it run to get the feel before I try to optimise settings. Fundamentals are something the originator of the manual system said you should keep an eye on though.

lol, thought that Euro and GBP spike was too good to last. One day left to go. I couldn't resit that manual buy for AUD/CAD and was up on that earlier. Lets see what happens tomorrow. This is only half the order open. Heck. If it goes more to pivot tomorrow ill call it for the week and close all..

Hi Emerald2112, check in the Trade comment, while I don't have the full details, I suspect if you have the first trade of that swing still running, subsequent trades will still be opened, close that 1st "mother" trade and the EA should stop buying GU. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

Hi, results of this week. Only trade in CADJPY. Nex week add more currencies.  
  
Since I recently joined this thread and I have not been able to read all the entries, is there any currency group more suitable for this strategy?  
Thanks.

Perhaps the indicator file is corrupted, you can re-download the EA and Indicator files here <https://goo.gl/b4JSHd>

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

It's pivot trading, works on any currency/commodities/index, as long as they have price movements, it should work.  
  
Read the EA Guide <https://goo.gl/RSSjcE> for best pairs to trade. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

v0.7 is a beta version, we are still working toward v0.8, until it reaches v1.0, we strongly recommend you to test the EA using DEMO money, as pre-v1.0 will have bugs and may MC your account in strong trend.  
  
You are welcome to join our **[Telegram](https://goo.gl/JxwhEF)** chat group <https://goo.gl/JxwhEF> to get the latest updates. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

Hi,  
  
Does this scenario only apply if Martingale is set to true and the account size is too small for the number of pairs traded?  
  
Thanks

Yes, if (1) Martingale set to true and (2) Account size is too small, or (3) Too many pairs traded, or wrong settings of these Variables below, will/may MC your account..  
  
(4)  
"profit in pips to start adding volume" - bigger number safer (15, 20, etc)  
"max opened trades" - smaller number safer  
"started lot size" - smaller number safer  
"Trade on R38" - ON for more trades/profit/loss, OFF is safer.  
"Trade on S38" - ON for more trades/profit/loss, OFF is safer.  
  
"Safer" means less risk/loss, also means less profit. To get a feel you can trade in Demo and adjust the settings as you go along (you can just use default EA settings as you start). Green pips. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

@Windchaser  
  
1\. Will this EA open trade on High/medium impact news.  
2\. Do I need to change the Magic number for every pair or leave as?  
  
Thanks

1\. As of now, it has no news filter or time filter, so it trades 24/5.  
2\. You can find the answer by reading the EA Installation Guide and FAQs <https://goo.gl/RSSjcE>  
  
Read the EA Guide and FAQs document before asking more questions. Thanks.

The EA works on ECN accounts, perhaps not your broker's ECN account, suggest to use another broker.

I am not sure if I get your question correctly. The v0.7 EA can trigger trades at S/R 38/61/78/100 pivot levels, and through the EA variable settings you can opt to turn them (trading at these levels) on/off. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

It is possible to add in the next version of the option that the transaction would close after x pips, as it is with profits that everything is closed after 1000 pips? the option of closing the transaction also works on average, if tdi is crossed, this transaction is not closed. It would be good if it would be possible to set a stop loss in a selected place by the user, for example before placing it in order to enter where we want to stop loss. For example, the price of 1.0001 is set manually, we want to stop loss at the price of 1.0011 We would decide where and how much we want to gain or lose, and the same can be with take profit. I am sorry for my average English

That seems to me, but I do not know how the EA works. I also have deactivated the trade in S / R 38, however EA opens trades. Can it be a bug of the version?

We will not create the manual "at price" settings, that defeats the true automation purpose of the EA.  
  
You can use "profit in pips to close all trades" and "max risk in percentage of balance" settings to adjust the TP/SL operation of the EA. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

I suggest you have a good look at this carefully work through it, pay particular attention to 3-d, and in approximately 3 minutes you should be up and running. [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1...q6L1ZRUyY/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19SmMfhHCVXHCqIYvSa4FwdZi9Uord_g2Ceq6L1ZRUyY/edit)  
  
Also, fwiw, this is not an EA that was created by Davit. It is an EA that takes his premise that trading against weekly pivot points can be profitable. I suggest you familiarize yourself with both the Davit string and this one.

Hi everyone, ive got this EA up and running now and doing some testing.  
  
I have a couple of questions and also some ideas for the next version but ill start with the questions to get a better understanding of this EA.  
  
Does simply clicking on the time frame button and the changing the time frame of the chart the EA is running on automatically change the TDI input period that the EA considers to open or close trades? So if you change timeframes to manually look at some other charts or big/small picture stuff - you have to be careful to go back to the TF you want the EA running on that particular chart before leaving the computer alone to do its thing or it will start trading on whatever TF you left it at?  
  
Also - what is the method of adjusting TP SL levels? I realise the TDI triggers the in/out most of the time, but is there an another method to set the stop loss as the default settings are producing very wide stop losses?  
  
As to an idea - ive read many making the point that this strategy doesnt work well in a trending market, only for ranging market. Well for future updates to this EA it would be relatively easy to add another filter based on say 3 longer term moving averages or even timeframes- which could filter out/prevent trades when above/below all 3 MA as an example. This way if a ranging market became a trending market due to fundamental change the EA would stop opening positions until within the correct market conditions again - just an idea but im sure its already been thought of already...  
yes im new here so be gentle ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

Hi groper, thanks for your feedback and question.  
  
Changing the TF on the chart will cause the EA to operate at that TF, we recommend TF set to H4 and keep it unchanged.  
  
You can use "profit in pips to close all trades" and "max risk in percentage of balance" settings to adjust the TP/SL operation of the EA.  
  
Thanks for your trend filtering suggestion, noted, we are exploring various techniques to improve the SL logic in trending markets.  
  
Thanks,  
WindChaser 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

i also have another idea for you to consider;  
  
Since there are 3 main pivot point zones to open positions- S/R38 S/R61 S/R78 - and since these zones have potentially different probability of going into correction - it would also be easy to add a lot multiplier number to the filter based on the zone the trade was triggered from.  
  
So for example if a trade was triggered at s38 it might open say 0.01 lot position open with lot multiplier = 1.  
But if the trade was triggered from s61 - lot multiplier of might be, for example, 2 thus it opens 0.02 lot position  
and finally if triggered from s78 - you guessed it - lot multiplier input eg. = 3 = 0.03 lot position open  
  
This way higher probability trades are automatically given more weight. What do you think?

There was some brexit news and GJ had an abrupt fall - just wonrdering why the EA didnt catch this trade opportunity as i think it should have caught this one?  
  
Do you think it could have been because the TDI turn occured between the R61 and S38 rather than within the 10pip range i set? Or does the EA catch any TDI turn once it crosses into or above the specified zones?  
See attached scrreenshot;  
  
And the second screen shot on the AU - again no open trades - yet look like a classic turn at the R61...

Your chart is showing AC (H1), but the floating trades are AU, I am a little confused.  
  
Please check the Experts or Journal tabs for any errors. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

Whether the trades are triggered by the EA, are determined by a few EA settings, as to why the EA opened/didn't open trades, kindly read **FAQ 3, 14 and 19** of the **EA Installation Guide and FAQs** <https://goo.gl/RSSjcE>

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

Our recommended TF is **H4** , I saw the screenshots you posted, the charts are all in different TF (H1, M30, etc), the EA might not work well in those TFs, trade at your own risk. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

Hi Windchaser - i have read the Guide and FAQs several times before posting.  
  
Sorry about the screenshots being in differing TF - ive been going up and down TF looking at the TDI to see whats happening with the indicators trying to figure out why that trade didnt close. All of my testing so far has been on H1 and thats where it was when i noticed the trades should have closed based on the TDI crossing shown in the indicator.  
  
i note that the TF recommended H4 but thought id try something different...  
  
The trade/order tab shown in the screen shot for AC was not for reference in this - the open positions on the chart were there but scrolled above it - theres no errors in that - i had other positions open in other charts etc...  
  
As i understand it - the EA is supposed to close positions when the TDI crosses against the trade direction.  
So is the exit parameter of "TDI crossing against the trade" automatically updated when the TF is changed?  
  
In v0,6 the TDI setting can be changed to use a specified TF for the TDI entry/exit. However i do not see this TF setting nor ATR TP / SL settings in v0.7... How does the TDI parameter work when its set to a specific TF (say 15min for scalping short term strategy) but yet the chart might be displayed in H4? What i mean is, with user set TDI in v0.6 - will the trades entry/exit behave in the same manner regardless of chart TF viewed?  
  
I also have to hazard a guess as to why v0.7 is recommened to H4 and those in/out parameters were left out of v0.7 - would it be correct to assume that the back testers have confirmed that the H4 setting and associcated TDI entry exits have produced the best results so far?  
  
This all running non-stop on VPS in case your wondering...

i think i figured out why it did not open the trades i referred to previously - missed the TDI cutoff of 60/40 by a whisker.  
  
However i still dont know why the open positions on AC didnt close... Does the TDI have to cross and then also be above/below 50 in order to close? Or is it when the TDI simply crosses to the opposite direction?

I just got the ea up and runnning. I had basically given up hope on it and just assumed that because I am in USA that the EA would not work with FIFO rules. I have been following Davit's thread closely for a long time. I had missed that the ea required a different version of the TDI- RT in order to run properly. Now it seems to be running fine on a US based [Oanda](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile") account.   
  
I am just wondering now if anyone can tell me, I have not given distinct magic numbers to each pair that the ea is running on. And I do have open trades. Can anyone tell me if I change the number for a pair that already has an open trade(s), will the ea not close the trade? Maybe I should only modify the magic numbers for the charts that do not have trades open currently? Thank you!

There's bug in v0.7 if TDI crossing in the opposite direction sometimes it's not closing the trades ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f603.png?v=15.1) This will be fixed in v0.8.  
  
In v0.6 we have an ATR bug,so we removed it in v0.7, but we will look into restoring the ATR logic in v0.9. In v0.6 we add TF input for TDI entry, so it will use TDI crossing setup from the chosen TF, and will use pivot line crossing based on current TF. Please note that EA makes trade decisions only after the candle is fully closed.  
  
We don't really support v0.6 anymore (but you can still use it). The TDI indi TF should match with the chart TF. H4 is our recommendation because on lower timeframes there would be many false signals and the profits were not consistent. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

Right, reading the EA Installation Guide and FAQs document **carefully** , is beneficial to everyone. <https://goo.gl/RSSjcE>  
  
Best to use different magic numbers for different pairs. Trades are already opened, will have the "old" magic number on them, if you change the magic number on pairs with running trades, those running trades will not be "managed" by the EA since the Magic Number is no longer matching.  
  
Yes, you can modify the magic numbers for the charts that do not have trades opened, currently. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

well im getting excellent results so far with v0.6 with a scaliping style strategy using the 15min TDI entry/exit;  
I could post a whole bunch of other screen shots just like thie one below... it just keeps working - hasnt lost a set for me yet, tho im sure it will come ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
Working on AU, CJ, UC, AC, EA, AJ pairs - im avoiding GBP crosses whilst this brexit stuff is lurking - cost me bomb last week, im staying away from it - and also avoiding anything looking very trendy atm. So the EA is getting strict oversight.  
i manually control when i let it take control however - and so far im not allowing trades at S/R38 only higher levels, and i simply dont like the look of the formation or pending news etc.  
On v0.6 i have Martingale active, TP at 100pips... I dont use martingale on v.07 and the slower time scales.  
V0.7 on the slower TF its entering alot less trades so i dont have as good a picture on the performance yet - but its still winning more than its loosing, so far so good.

hey groper   
  
nice to see your results on M15. Im having good results with H4, and occasional manual intervention.   
  
You said you were using the TDI entry method - are you also using the TDI angle meter arrow or degree? are you doing anything that isn't ootb - and if so can you share settings?  
  
would be greatly appreciated thanks! blam

no entry angle or direction indicators yet - i may experiment with this later but havnt tried to yet.

thanks for the reply groper - yes I'm sure there will be ups and downs to come this is forex after all!  
  
ootb means 'out of the box' i.e. default settings. So basically currently you're using it on m15 charts, S/R38 set to false and TP at 100 pips, martingale on.  
  
is anything else changed in the settings? if possible if you could share v0.6 would be great, I can't find it, only v.051 and v0.7

yes you have it, so not all ootb settings. Also - add volume 3 pips, max risk i set to very low number - depends on your account size.  
  
Another theory on this is to basically trade any change in TDI direction between SR61 - SR100. This means you can set pretty big numbers for the size of the pivot zone range and it will enter basically anywhere in the upper ranges provided the TDI entry conditions are met.  
  
See attached if you want to play but earlier versions no longer supported by aziz and the guys working on this... be sure to read all about it and the bugs it contains, use at own risk...

Good stuff. I like the idea that you are keeping the ea on tight reins. I think AN was one of Davit's favorite pairs, why aren't you running that one? Also, I am a bit weary of EA and AJ on this system, because when we get a change in risk sentiment they can blow through almost everything... I prefer more the idea of using an atr for entry when there is an overlap. I have attached a good atr if you need.

Thanks!  
I am running AN- its only taken 100pips frok that pair so far.  
  
I agree on the sentiment driven pairs- I try to avoid those when things are looking funky although i did pull some trades off the r100 level when really overbought so its a matter of assessing the big picture at times. If you just leave the EA unattended- its always going to take some stupid trades... all EAs only work in certain market conditions- im not aware of any 1 system that works in all markets all the time...

Next two to three weeks, we regret the delays as Aziz and I have been busy on our work front (it’s a hobby project, you see).  
  
v0.8 is almost ready and more details will follow. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

**FAQ 3** of <https://goo.gl/RSSjcE>  
  
**3\. I have Smiley Face icon on my chart, but why there are no trades opened?**  
Smiley Face means the rPT-EA is running, however the EA is not designed to trade at regular intervals, instead, depending on which Pivot levels the price is hovering at AND if there is TDI cross (below the “**TDI Maximum for BUY** ” number and above the “**TDI Minimum for SELL** ” number) , only then a buy/sell trade will be executed. **Also, the EA is designed NOT to trigger any NEW trades on Fridays as it readies for a new set of pivots on the coming Monday, however, the EA can/will trigger trades on Friday if there are existing floating trades from previous few days.** You can check the **Experts tab** or **Journal tab** to find any trade operation errors. **Be patient.**

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

Have you considered a variable that would allow the user to declare a trend/break in trading? E.g., if a trend goes past R100 or S100, I would not want any (counter) trades opened.

The EA does not open trades beyond S/R100 pivot lines, are you saying you would like a variable for the EA to trade SR138/161/178? Not sure if I understand what you wrote correctly. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

This is not in Davit's strategy (trading beyond S/R100), don't think we will create such a variable. In v0.8, we designed **the EA to not trade against the trend** , ie. if the GBPUSD pair is in strong down trend, it will NOT open buy orders even if prices hit S61/78/100 (and TDI crosses). It leads to less trades, but higher quality trades, we believe. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

Please read Post 1, currently we are at v0.7, there is no commercial roadmap but we don't rule that out for future releases beyond v1.0 (it's stated there in Post 1), the primary objective is to create a stable/working EA, all other objectives are secondary. Thanks. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

Hello guys,  
A big thanks to both of you @akangaziz and @WindChaser for this thread and this good EA.  
I tested the EA on my demo account and it works great. Very good promising EA.  
But, yes there is a but, I try to figure out why it is not working on my real account (balance: 986$). I did everthing according to the installation guide but no trades opened while it opened several trades on demo account.  
Any idea ?

Please read the EA installation manual to fix this issue, on Post 1.

I think he is asking for the pivot levels indicator so he can visualise it on the chart whilst EA trades.

Interesting, do you guys have some backtests for single trades taken with increased position size like trading 0.50-1 Lot instead of 0.01? What are the results here, would be interested in case of max drawdown and average monthly returns by trading only one market here over let’s say 1-2 years at least.  
  
do you have such backtest for your latest version?  
  
Have you tried other Markets than forex like Dax or the E-Mini Nastaq.  
  
kind regards

The backtests and Optimizations are still ongoing, we will share when they are completed.  
  
We use $10,000 as starting balance, 0.1 lot size in backtest so the lotsize multiplier will reflect correctly, no money management added in backtest so to produce the profit/drawdown results objectively.  
  
Test are done from 1 Jan 2010 to 31 Dec 2018, to ensure the EA can perform over a long period of time.  
  
We have some backtest guidance, more information can be [found here](https://www.ralgo-ea.com/backtest-the-ea/). 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

Did you add <http://api.ralgo-ea.com> in the WebRequest URL?  
  
Also, need to add your trading account on <http://member.ralgo-ea.com> before the EA can work.  
  
PM me on Telegram @WindChaser1

v0.8 is doing well despite the market unheavals the past two weeks, it’s still an unfinished product and we are happy with its potential.  
  
As Davit has improved his method further (no TDi, price action and news), our methods are different from his method. I think it is a good thing, it creates diversity and choices.  
  
Green pips.

Thanks for sharing, the EA is being improved upon on daily basis, the aim is to achieve solid long-term consistency in performance and profitability.  
  
Some of you might be wondering why there are not many discussion here (or whether the EA is dead) -- The EA is fully alive and active, just that most of the discussions are happening in the Telegram chat group ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  

  
Green pips to all. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

Hi all, thanks for your patience, we are pleased to release v0.8.4, you can get the files [here](http://www.ralgo-ea.com/download).  
  
Please note there is an additional file (socket-library-mt4-mt5.mqh) you need to save in the Include folder of your MT4 terminal, before v0.8.4 can work properly.  
  
The new version might not be able to continue the management of your current floating trades opened by v0.8.1, so for floating trades you will have to manually manage them.  
  
New trades opened by v0.8.4 has a slightly different trade Comment - "**r_pivot_v0.8.4: R61** " is an example.  
  
_v0.8.4 has these features/fixes:_  
1\. Pivot line drawing bug fixed (no need to restart MT4 terminal on Monday morning)  
2\. 4000 and 502 WebRequest Errors fixed (except the 5203 error which you can ignore)   
3\. A new setting on "Allowing Multi Trade Cycles from the same Pivot Levels"  
4\. An improved Cumulative Trailing Stop logic  
5\. More efficient Trade Data sync  
  
Green pips! 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

Yes, it's required for EA protection and Fraud Control, v0.8 is free but it does not mean it can be abused by unscrupulous parties. As EA author we reserve the rights to protect our EA.  
  
Lastly, this is not the only EA one can use, if anyone is not comfortable with registration, there are many other EA choices available in ForexFactory or MQL5.

first week i used trade from all levels even 38. and this is what caused the DD and which left me with this floating trades. all the trades still running are from this last week. second week turned that off having experienced drawdown due to this. Definetly after the experience i found better not to trade from 38 levels. Still in the process of fine tuning. Still. this account was -4700 when i put eat on ( i know i should have put it in a clean chart-- and will this week to try other variables out at the same time and see which outperforms. Many good trades. sme got closed too early so trying to find out the perfecto combo to try and catch more of a move without risking leavig too many floating trades to cause the drawdown. EVEN with this DD the ea managed to keep doing trades and doubled account!!!!!

Hello   
  
Ive started chart setup on several pairs testing several multipair eas, this appears to be a well designed and very cleverly implemented ea  
  
I only hope the strategy is as well implemented as the programmers ability!   
  
Im also trying Easistan ea which is very similar logic so this is exciting to find bc thats a very good expert that has survived latest eurusd and gbpusd crash with 28 pairs on $200 acct lol! They recpmmend 10x the balance btw...  
  
I look forward to testing and im glad you wont kick me out like Davit would as you see my username gives me away ;-]  
  
Im trying very hard and only hope I can reach long term profitability with tools like these so I can keep working part time as well  
  
Thanks OP very much for sharing your work, I believe sharing is a key element in the human race that has been left behind for self gain only... Great to see this

If you are new I recommend you use DEMO accounts and spend as much time learning, only when your demo accounts are making money consistently (average up your profit/losses for a few months), you can then start with a small real money account -- if you are new but choose to hurry into Forex, you will experience monetary losses.  
  
There are way too many clueless traders who just want to try their luck by using real money and most of them ended up losing money. They think of Forex as the "Possibility" to make buckets of $, however many fail to understand Forex is a game of "Probability" and behind it, it's mathematics (technical) and economics (fundamental) driving prices up and down.  
  
Green pips. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

I agree I have used several eas and manual strategi successfully as well as unsuccessfully and have cautiously transitioned to a live acct where i mostly manual trade and use a few very good eas (tried 40, 36 are bad!)  
  
I will really get to know this EA as it looks very promising but it will be on one of my 3 demo accts, one of which wnt from 10k - 70k - 10k in 2 weeks using only a overoptimized scalper ea...  
  
slowly learning manual is key for agressive and ea is key for steady gain, AND it PAYS to listen to the voice of experience however I also know risk and reward go together closely.. I have a somewhat healthy appetite for risk and a decade of self employed sales has conditioned me for loss and taught me to never stop trying ever..  
  
as a classicaly trained engineer (failed??) I have a tendency to devour information at a rate that is exhausting stupid brain doesnt turn off 20 hrs at a time!  
  
Thanks for taking the time to respond.. I look to failing forward ;-)

Any way to see a trade explorer to verify mine is acting normally? Not a single trade open so far on 17 pairs all default settings on 20k demo...  
  
GBPUSD had some great price action today and I would have expected it to trigger from r78 or r61.8 but nothing

If the "Pips range for Pivot" setting is set to 15 for GBPUSD, by the time TDI has crossed the price is more than 15 pips away from R61, hence the EA was behaving correctly (due to the settings) by NOT triggering any trade. Understanding and adjusting the settings will help. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

We have not optimized the EA for aggressive sets, but it's possible, if you have access to Backtesting software, please feel free to do so. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

We have a group of volunteer members who perform backtest and optimzation work on the Pivot EA v0.8.4, they are not ordinary backtesters, we screened them and only those with strong backtest/optimization capabilities are admitted into the group, we will release the optimized sets gradually as we have them.  
  
If you are interested you can take a look at some of the backtest screenshots [here](https://www.ralgo-ea.com/view-backtest-results/). 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

Awesome results, i have a few robots in pips today  
  
I thought with such such a skilled developer rAlgo would be really cool with an android app to change settings via mobile  
  
Any thoughts?

No, we don't have plans to work on mobile-related requests, we need to focus our energy and momentum advancing the Pivot Trading EA. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

Wow, I am looking more closely at all these perfect 62 and 78 rejections for 100 ++ pips and thinking much more closely about this ea  
  
Trading frequency or infrequency rather had me losing interest, but it's not about frequency is it..  
  
I believe you have a fine piece of work here  
  
It will help me with my patience and stupidity in the market ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Some trade Forex with a gambler's mindset, some trade with investor's mindset. Some traders like more precise entries, some traders like EA to trade more trades -- the way to meet different traders' preferences is through the settings.  
  
If you want more trades, put the EA on more pairs, turn off PSAR filter (set it to False), the EA will trigger more trades but please note that more trades does not necessarily equal to more profit.  
  
Green pips. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

I think it's just a multiple step verification to protect his hard work from being copied  
  
I have actually set the pivot distance relative to the fib level gaps, some are about 8-10 others are higher, and set the psar to current instead of weekly, then i adjusted tp to 20 pips much like another professional ea software similar to this, and set it to 1.0 lot 28 pairs on a $20k demo, and have had 100% success rate, increasing the trading frequency and decreasing pip target have increased apparent probability and allowed for a larger lot size and has had very manageable dd so far, less than 10% actually..  
  
I am thinking more about this logic and I think it would be a very good feature to automatically set pivot distance for signal and tp target based on a manual or automatic adjustable atr period or adr some kind of tunable range indicator and it would be very easy to tune each pair with the strategy tester, I feel like it will unlock the fine tuning ability for each pairs personality as we know they're all different in this particular range parameter and we even clearly see this on the different pivot distances on different pairs.. I believe this can recoup some money we leave on the table without getting greedy like momma said lol!  
  
I think this could save the great thought and effort that can be spent fine tuning for individual pairs, but the overall concept of increasing frequency and probability seems attractive to my risk profile.. It looks to be a workable method on fwd testing so far... I will post a detailed report soon...

Telegram instant messaging is the way we can communicate with users of this EA. If you don't have Telegram we suggest you to install it on your phone/PC, otherwise you can just put your first name in the Telegram box, to continue the registration. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

We just released the [USDJPY set file](https://www.ralgo-ea.com/view-backtest-results/) produced by our volunteer backtest group from our member community, just FYI.   
  
It took a lot of effort and time to produce good set files, and to ensure long term viability all the 99.90% backtests are conducted with Dukascopy pricing data from 1 Jan 2010 to 31 Dec 2018.  
  
Each currency pairs have different "personalities" hence different set files are needed.  
  
Set files do not guarantee sure-win profits, but they can serve as guidance to you.

Are there a collection of sets available? I didn't see them on the website easily..  
  
I did some 99.9 testing on gu tonight with impressive results, 200% in 3 months and relatively low dd too considering the return all using only 20 pip target and 15 distance.. Oh and 2 lots on only $1000 start, very impressive, I do this "stress test" to find a breaking point and it was 3 lots/1000 for this set which I was surprised with. That tick data eats ssd space fast or I would dl all pairs, maybe on my desktop soon laptop definitely not..  
  
I just can't seem to get it to work with gold tried several things. Seems like gold just doesn't respect the pivots at all or maybe certain days or hours possibly...  
  
Thanks!

Loaded on my new VPM on 4 pairs on a demo with 8K and using 0.01 lot. Should I try more pairs at once or see how this goes. Im using the same setting for each or any ideas on how I should set for these ones great.

Since it’s Demo you can try $8K Demo on 16 pairs (0.01 lot), to check how bad is the DD. Not the official recommendation but it’s the “test” recommendation. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

The EA does not trade every hour, it trades when the conditions are met.  
  
If you want more trades, you can turn on the S/R38 levels, and turn off PSAR filter. More risky, and more trades.  
  
Green pips. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

You can start with a 100K Demo account, put on 24 pairs to learn about this EA. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

I don't mean you specifically. I mean in general. In order to get access to the setfiles, one would need to run the ea for atleast one week, as far as I understood.

_"The set files are available in a password-protected webpage.... the password is shared in the**rAlgo Real Traders** Telegram chat group (to start, you can join the [**rAlgo Pivot EA Entry Group**](http://bit.ly/2W5rHcV) on Telegram app)"_  
  
The set files are only available to legitimate users of the EA, password to the set files is found in the pinned message of the **rAlgo Real Traders group** , you can only join the rAlgo Real Traders group when you are added, as it's a closed group.  
  
For now, you can join the open _[**rAlgo Pivot EA Entry Group**](http://bit.ly/2W5rHcV) _to start, it's the entry group to ascertain that you are a real user, and not bots, once your EA has traded, I will add you to the _**rAlgo Real Traders group**_.

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

Confluences of Fib and TDI are areas of high-probability trades, price action determines the trade eventuality. There are a million and one ways to trade, just like songs/music -- you can never run out of tunes to make new songs.  
  
VP might be right, but he can be wrong too, to each its own. I can't comment on when Fib+TDI are used in **manual** trading, since our EA is trading **unattended**. One way to stop the argument is to perform 99.9% backtest, if the Pivot EA (uses Fib+TDI) works and shows positive results in backtest, this is all that matters to us (users of this EA), mic drop -- how do you argue with results backed by 99.9% data?  
  
<http://ralgo-ea.com/view-backtest-results/>  
  
Our EA backtest and optimization have to comply with realistic and non-fancy requirements, they are not tested to impress people, they are generated purely to ensure that the EA is viable over long term (in this case, it's 9 years, 1 Jan 2010 to 31 Dec 2018).  
  
Also as the EA is backtestable, you can back test it yourself (we recommend Tick Data Suite). 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

Does the backtesting suffer from repainting?

I am not sure if you asked the right question but I will try to answer.  
  
The EA uses the built-in TDI indicator, it does not repaint but like most indicators, it’s laggy.  
  
The backtest is performed on historical price feeds, but it does not “tell” the EA the forward price during backtest in order to produce an accurate result.  
  
The Optimisation process, is an effort to find a set of optimal settings (for a currency pair) which would produce trading results with high Profit Factor and low Drawdown for a currency pair, in order to survive the price fluctuation during the period under test (in our case, it’s 9 years). 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

Today the EA took trade for the first time and closed the 6 trades in profit.   
Last week it didn't take any trade. At the weekend I made the following changes and it took a trade for the first time.  
With default .set files it didn't take any trade. It took trades when i made 3 changes in the default settings. They are:  
1.Psar filter: False  
2\. s/r38: true  
3\. Time Frame: 1 Day

From our backtest, trading the 38 levels are not profitable, best not to trade 38 levels.  
  
Also, you should turn on PSAR for less risky trades, and less DD.  
  
Green pips. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

The pairs are AJ/GA/GU/EA/EJ/NJ/EU/GJ/AC/NU/AU/UJ and exotic pairs like USDCNH/USDCZK/USDMXN. In total 15 pairs.  
For the exotic pairs, there is still no trade opened by the EA.

I would like to add to the above.   
TDI _ Clone / dynamic traders index /, was created by a trader named Dan Malone. It's not the Holy Grail. But, this is an advanced oscillator and trend indicator, known for trading Made Simple system. This is a whole analyzing complex that allows you to track both flat and trend movements in the market. This indicator can be used equally well on all currency pairs. With a reasonable approach, it can bring a very good profit. For a professional , this indicator can be a good filter of the trading system.

Don't worry. The EA will take trade itself after a week with default settings (for the first time). ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

The pivot point itself is simply the average of the high, low and closing prices from the previous trading day.

Everybody knows that. But still traders were unsuccessful. But Davit focused on it in a very effective way & became successful. Moreover, he made many traders life successful.

Only "successful' traders will continue to post on the Pivot Trade (or on any system thread for that matter)  
Those that fall by the way side (losers) are never accounted for (the majority)

The sentence above shows that you are in the wrong thread, here we trade weekly pivots, not “previous trading day” pivots. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

Check the Expert Log for errors, or turn off PSAR filter and turn on 38 levels to get more trades.

broker used could also affect ea/indi. certain broker does not allow this indi to be used for ea, means u get no input from the indi on the chart so ea wont work.

I don’t think what you just said is correct. Brokers do not know what indicators you use, they can’t snoop into your PC to see the indicators you installed.

Can you please tell me how you set up this report? Is this an EA? If yes how does the EA acknowledge and count only the pivot trading EA's trades and not all trades?

Hi.   
Thank you for your advice . ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f91d.png?v=15.1)  
  
for example : week opened 1) \ distance. S/R 38 from PP 35 pips \ . On what Pivot to assume a reversal of the price ?  
. .week opened 2) \ distance. S/R 38 from PP 100 pips \\. On what Pivot to assume a reversal of the price ?  
  
I have a rule ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f64f.png?v=15.1) : "I manage EA . EA does not control me."

I'm not getting any trades either. I thought it might e been the pivot distance but had it at 15 then 20. Thought it might have been no trade at 38 but sure some hit 68. I'm going to reset today for next week but if someone can post a copy of there settings that's working please do. Cheers

Our EA and Davit's methodology has **somewhat diverged** ,  
  
Eg.  
\- Davit no longer uses TDI, but our EA still does (and it's still profitable)  
\- Davit's entries are based on Price Action, we will consider looking into that.  
\- Davit studies the weekly economic calendar and news releases, our EA does not.  
\- Our EA has incorporated sophisticated MM techniques, and highly configurable to suit different traders' styles.  
\- Since it's an EA, it is tireless and can work on more currency pairs on top of Davit's preferred pairs.  
  
but you can still learn the core trading methodology on Davit's thread.  
  
**Regardless the differences, the main goal for both systems is still the same \-- to milk maximum pips from price reversal swings through the Weekly Fibonacci Pivots.**

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

If you can't access our **[www.ralgo-ea.com](http://www.ralgo-ea.com)** website, I am not sure how I can help you, perhaps you should contact your ISP or government.  
  
If you are looking for the public set files on **<http://ralgo-ea.com/view-backtest-results/>** , you will have to join the **rAlgo Real Traders** Telegram chat group, the password is in the pinned message of that chatgroup. To start, join the [**rAlgo Pivot EA Entry Group**](https://t.me/joinchat/AYzywEdkF7B_E7GEVvhFCg).

Got the new version taking trades. Not many but I only have a few pairs loaded. All positive though so will load more and check the settings as to why only a few opening on the pairs I have it on. Haven't looked at the set files yet as just going by the info on the site.

Sorry if it's answered, but I have to ask. **With $1000/0.01/pair balance recommendation,** does it means that if I have $1000 balance I can use EA on just one pair, or I can use EA on how many pair I want but use 0.01 lot per pair?

For now we recommend trading the EA using Demo account to understand how the EA works.  
  
But yes, if you have $1000 balance, use it on 1 pair only, and trade only 0.01 lotsize, this is our **safest** and **official recommendation**.  
  
Of course the EA **will still work** if you have $1000 balance but decide to trade it on 10 currency pairs, but you are taking a huge risk and your account will most certainly face a stop out (SO) or margin call (MC) in one of the days -- We understand some are "gambler traders" who do not mind taking high risks, if so please trade at your own risk, but when your account run into troubles, please do not blame the EA. (Analogy: You buy a sedan car and the car manufacturer tells you this car can only be driven on normal roads, but you took the car for 4WD cross-country tours, and the car broke down -- you can't blame the manufacturer for not making the car strong enough for 4WD cross-country conditions.)  
  
Lastly, if you have low balance abut want to trade more pairs, consider use a CENT or MICRO account. Once you have spend enough time trading the EA, you will soon figure out the best/safest margin on how many pairs can the EA trade over x amount of balance.  
  
Green pips. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

Does this EA have a stop loss mechanism in which when price goes beyond 100R/S, it starts closing positions in an incremental manner? What happens beyond 100R/S exactly?  
  
Davit said it is not efficient to close all positions once there, but to slowly close positions because market sometimes makes a reversal for a chance to recover the losses and sometimes profit.

Did you read the webpage in full?   
  
There is a paragraph on that webpage which says “The set files are available in a password-protected webpage on this website, the password is shared in the **rAlgo Real Traders** Telegram chat group (to start, you can join the [**rAlgo Pivot EA Entry Group**](http://bit.ly/2W5rHcV) on Telegram app)”

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

Which settings do you use and how many pairs do you trade with this EA?  
Because for me the result of April is $17 of close profit and +/- 100$ of pending loss. 28 pairs, defaut settings, $1000 demo account.

I don't understand your question above, there are two "how to", does it mean the sentence contains two questions?  
  
How to set up a black swan event? As in, how do you manipulate the forex market to create a crash?   
  
Also, I don't know what is a wind control, why do you want to control the wind? 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

I also watch for big round numbers, in this instance, the first line I considered to be support, the small break downwards moved just 2 pips from a big round number ( 124000 ) these also tend to work as an S&R, so I had 2 proper reasons to look for a long over there.

Sure, you can apply what you just said in manual trading, the EA has no settings to trade the big round numbers. Green pips. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

If you have not joined the Telegram chat group, I suggest you to do so, some star members there are sharing their performing sets (but of course everyone is still in exploratory stage to find the best sets).

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

[EXNESS](/brokers/exness "View Exness Broker Profile") is a scam broker.  
  
  
I have been trading since last 10 years and know the forex brokers very well. Recently for trying the Expert Advisor I needed a Cent account to test it and it is provided by only a few brokers and Exness is one among them. So I asked their “online support” about their withdrawal procedure with SKRILL. He replied “instant”. So before 2 weeks, to test their withdrawal system I made a small deposit of US$500. Then I withdrew $100 and it was “instant”, so I was happy. Then again tried to withdraw $100 and it was rejected. After that, I tried several times, and every time it was rejected.   
I contacted their online support and they advised me to trade 4-5 standard lots otherwise they will hold my money and I cannot withdraw. I informed them that I never took a bonus from them, so I am not bound to trade with them. Then I tried to withdraw several times and every time was rejected. But ultimately they were forced to pay me and that’s a long story. So traders to trade deposit with Exness.

Result for 3 months (28.01.2019 - 27.04.2019)  
14 currency pairs (often traded by Davit): EURUSD,AUDCAD,AUDNZD,AUDUSD,EURAUD,EURCAD,EURGBP,GBPAUD,GBPJPY,GBPNZD,GBPUSD,NZDCAD,NZDUSD,USDCAD  
Start with a cents account: 237.38 USD  
All closed transactions on 26.04.2019: 486.19 USD  
Profit: 248.81 USD  
There was no margin call problem because EA does not trade with all pairs each week.  
It can be seen that with the GBPNZD pair there is not one trade. There is a very high spread.  
The losers are clearly visible. A little more attention, I'll have to turn them over.  
I have noted the important changes. For each pair is different.

Печалба: 248.81 USD  
Нямаше проблеми с margin call, защото EA не търгува с всички двойки всяка седмица.  
Вижда се, че с двойката GBPNZD, няма нито една търговия. Има много висок спред.  
Ясно се виждат и губещите двойки. Малко повече внимание, ще трябва да им обърна.  
Важните промени съм ги отбелязал. За всяка двойка е различно.

Thanks for the update.  
1\. Who is the broker?  
2\. The set file is different for each pair, right?

I use only Bulgarian brokers. Here is VARCHEV, but it does not matter.  
Yes, I use templates instead of set file. It is normal that each pair has a different spread and a different pips Range.  
There is no point in posting them because my broker uses different [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") from yours. The range is consistent with the spread. The other settings are the same. A Magic number is different.  
  
Използвам само български брокери. В случая е VARCHEV, но това няма значение.  
Да, аз използвам templates, а не set file. Нормално е, всяка двойка има различен спред и различен pips Range.  
Няма смисъл да ги публикувам, защото моят брокер използва различни спредове от вашите. Диапазона е съобразен спрямо спреда. Останалите настройки са еднакви. А и Magic number е различен.

That's ok that if you have saved the .set files in templates for various pairs. But for 14 pairs did you have 14 settings or used only one setting?

As I said, each pair has a different spred, a different pips Range and a different Magic number. Thus, 14 different templates are obtained.  
  
Както вече казах, всяка двойка има различен spred, различен pips Range и различен Magic number. Така се полуават 14 различни templates.

Hi, I couldn't see the TradeReport indicator that included the DD. Does anyone have that one they can post?  
Thanks  
Carlos

That is not inclusive of P/L% AND DD%. I had that already, thanks.

Honestly, I got it from the band in the Telegram. I used TradeReport and AccountEquityAnalyzer for a long time. But this one is in the picture:

Hi chayon, click on the chart and press and hold down the “Home” button to load all the historical bars, reload EA. Cheers. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

what values do you use on "Pips range for pivot" and on "Max spread to enter trade" for the major pairs?

Read this, and use Average Daily Range to decide the values. <https://www.ralgo-ea.com/0-8-explanation>

Thank you for the reply WindChaser. I was just wondering what settings the other users use.  
  
Another question. How can I use a trader report indicator to monitor only the trades that the EA does and not all the other trades that I make manually? All my rAlgo charts have different magic numbers. Is there a way to set the trade report indicator to take into account only these carts with the specific magic numbers?

Well, after working around 3 Months with this EA i can slowly give a statement what i think about this.   
  
Started on a Demo first and saw the potential of this EA, switched to real very quick, althought the Admins didnt recommend that because its still in progress.  
  
Made a 200€ Live Account maybe 2 Months ago which is already beyond 1.000€, to bad i didnt link it to myfxbook. Even with pretty simple settings this EA is a Beast if you know how to manage it. I´m using very save settings with only 0.01 lots and without multiplier. Working with all Charts except GBP´s and Exotics. Even Gold is getting killed by the EA, 8/8 tp´s hit perfectly. Max. DD was about 125€ when the Account was at 580 Balance.. not to bad I´d say. (News related)  
  
See the attached File, those are the profits from 5 Trading days.  
  
Good look in trying out yourself!

Not enough historical data. Click once on the chart, press and hold down the "Home" button on your keyboard to load all historical data, once finished reload EA.

You can ignore these Web Request error, there is a bug in the EA code which causes the trade data sync to be erroneous at times. The errors do not affect the operation of the EA at all. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

You can certainly backtest the EA, please follow steps and recommendations in <https://www.ralgo-ea.com/backtest-the-ea/> and <https://www.ralgo-ea.com/faq>   
  
Unfortunately due to our busy schedule we can’t provide backtest troubleshooting service to anyone, you can seek help in this forum or our Telegram group (see Post 1). 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

So far I'm running great with the EA, recently added XAUUSD into the portfolio.  
Yet I'm curious about what are the major bugs at the moment you all encountered with the EA?

I had the situation with EA running on my MT4 platform.  
  
Actually, it's already the second time that happened. So, EA opened buy 0.01 position on EURCAD at 61 levels, and the pair started to drop so I expected it to buy more at 78 and at 100, which it always does. However, it didn't happen, since for some reason AutoTrading was turned off. ( maybe my problem) When I realized it and turned it on it opened this monster 3.41 buy lot to cover what it missed. That's insane, I was actually lucky to close it at 0, however, it's just crazy emotional experience to see your PnL goes up and down.  
  
What should I do next time to avoid this situation?  
And what's EA's algorithm to act in those kinds of events?  
  
Small note here: I had some other positions opened as well, but none of them were opened by EA. I think maybe EA wanted to cover all with just one single monster size position. Not sure. Please advice

I don’t think your backtest is accurate, strive to use 99.90% quality and perform the tests again. [www.ralgo-ea.com/backtest-the-ea](http://www.ralgo-ea.com/backtest-the-ea) has some guidance there. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

Known Bugs of v0.8.4 (Join our Telegram group on Post 1 for more info):  
1\. Sometimes the Weekly Pivot Lines are not updated automatically - temporary fix -> restart terminal or reload the EA.  
2\. However, if you restart the terminal with floating trades, the EA might open subsequent trades (of that same floating pairs) in erratic huge lot sizes (eg. 30 lots!)  
3\. Some members reported that even without restarting the erratic lotsize issue still happens to them.  
4\. "Pent-up" trades - if Once-Per-Bar setting is ON, after a huge candle appeared the EA would open new trades in quick successions without following the Pip Distance setting. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

Hey! Got 1 question. Why EA closes trades so early? Testing it for second day, it opened 3 trades on different pairs so far and all 3 trades closed in ~15pip profit instead of building up additional trades or something that could turn out in higher profit.

“Ea terminated” error is a simple fix, pls read the ReadMe file in [https://drive.google.com/drive/u/5/f...Hc9qxdKJIWJXKl](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/5/folders/1jDH-h7y2j7o2iDvPDAHc9qxdKJIWJXKl) to resolve the issue.

Hi mayer, for now it has no expiry date, but we can't promise there will be one (or not) in the future. Feel free to use it. [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jDH-h7y2j7o2iDvPDAHc9qxdKJIWJXKl?usp=sharing ](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jDH-h7y2j7o2iDvPDAHc9qxdKJIWJXKl?usp=sharing)

Please check the Expert tab log to see if there are any errors in the EA operation, otherwise, you just need to wait for the EA to trigger trades when the price candle hits the Pivot zones. 

It's either going UP, or DOWN.

I can list a couple reasons. The strategy is Open source but OP has decided he wants to eventually profit on the success of another person's strategy. He laid the ground work with his EA "protection". In which this guy is collecting your information. Nobody wants the NSA 2.0 and nobody likes someone gaining clout off someone else's success.   
  
The irony is the protection was put in place to prevent "malicious actors" but is in place to eventually turn a profit. None of this is enlightening news because the OP himself has stated it. There is no "expiry date" for now but we can't promise it.  
  
I got nothing against the OP. What is pretty annoying is watching the cycle of things. Someone releases something to benefit people but then does the switcharoo once they see the success and the eventual dollar signs.

I have just contacted "Windchaser" via "Telegram" and awaiting upon his response. However I personally think you are getting that error for 1 of 2 reasons.  
  
1) Are you are member of their website before what happened in my 2nd reason? Even if you are a member, I still think my 2nd reason is the main issue here.  
  
2) The website has been down for a while now, so that can be a reason for failure.  
  
I will update all, when I here back from "Windchaser". 

If you don’t risk anything, you risk even more.

Just an update, they are working on the problem and "Windchaser" stated this on "Telegram". His words listed below.  
  
Hi we have a technical issue with the rAlgo server, working on it.

I agree with the above and even though I have been in contact with "Windchaser", they say they needed to manually start their dedicated server, well that is odd, as that does not take days lol. So we can surmise this is all over now.

I bet this system is not working now, can you confirm as that would help this thread and the members of this great forum.

I believe your test Tick Data quality might be the issue, you can consider using TSD [Tick Data Suite (eareview.net)](https://eareview.net/tick-data-suite)

It's either going UP, or DOWN.
