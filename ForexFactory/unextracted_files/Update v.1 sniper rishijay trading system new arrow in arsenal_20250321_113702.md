**prices starts moving from convergence of moving averages points, so identify points of convergence of moving averages to take position from there, till convergence of moving averages is not there it is sitting on the sideline only !!**  
  
**and moving averages are the ones that works always !!! it is higher top and higher bottom and lower top and lower bottom and then to find out when prices moves is the point of convergence of moving averages.**  
**\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**  
  
  
load 50 ema of all timeframes ( monthly, weekly, daily, H4(h6 is more synchronised with D1), H1, M15, M5, M1) in single chart using mtf function of mtf moving average indicator,  
  
and this way you can see 50 emas in single chart of important timeframes, 50 ema is support and resistance, and prices moves from 50 ema of one timeframe to 50 ema of other timeframe  
==========================================================================================================================================================================================  
this is for instruments whose chart is available for 24 hours round the clock  
  
\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
for instruments chart where it is traded during only exchange open time (roughly 6-7 hours), in this case, in above timeframes H4 needs to be replaced by H1 , (so the sequence in this case of timeframe is monthly, weekly, daily, H1, M15, M5, M1 rest remains same in sync.)  
====================================================================================================================================================================================  
  
alternatively you can also load 13 ema of above same time frames in single chart and that will yield the same result as ( 13 ema x 4 =52 (50 ema)), as above timeframes are also equally divided by factor of 4 as described below

\- macd cloud trading with absolutely new macd indicator . that enables simply cloud based trading with ease.  
  
-more visual trend identification immediately by looking at cloud color and golden line possible.  
  
-trading rules made more simplified-  
  
buy signal.-- 1)-- macd cloud above golden line.  
2)-- bar color--blue that matches with cloud color and indicators color in separate lower indicator panel.  
3)-- buy arrow appears on chart  
  
sell signal-- 1)-- macd cloud below golden line.  
2)-- bar color--red color that matches with cloud color and indicators color in separate lower indicator panel.  
3)-- sell arrow appears on chart

rishijay trading system of moving averages  
======================================  
THANKS TO MLADEN, MRTOOLS AND XARD  
  
and rijay @ rijay's system of moving averages  
forex-station.com/viewtopic.php?f=578267&t=8473287  
====================================================  
  
create Downloads folder in indicator folder of mt4 terminal and put all indicators in this Downloads folder , and restart mt4(mt5) terminal  
otherwise this templets will not work !!  
  
mindset and risk management is the key. risk only 1-2% of your capital on each trade. risk management is how you control your lot size while trading !!  
call and put options open interest levels are the real support and resistance levels, from where prices jumps and reacts.  
  
market moves from convergence of moving averages to divergence of moving averages alternatively  
  
moving averages to use-- 5,13(20, 13-20 ema zone decides swings), 50,200 exponential moving averages.  
prices moves from point when there is convergence of moving averages  
when there is convergence of moving averages, from this convergence points prices moves fast(13 ema converging on 50 ema for next swing to start)  
more the convergence of moving averages of all timeframes more stronger the next move and trend will be.!!  
  
50 ema in any timeframe is equillibrium point from where new swing begins, 50 ema acts as point of mean reversal.  
  
so prices moves from 50 ema of one timeframe to other( see below timeframes synchronised for that) qwma is set as 50 ema of this timeframes,  
  
5 ema, 13(13-20 ema zone), 50 ema , 200 ema does the same representation, reflecting 50 ema of corresponding higher and lower timeframes  
  
above 50 ema(exponential moving average) and below 50 ema(exponential moving average) = above center line of macd and below center line of macd(centerline of macd=50 ema)  
  
13 ema x 4 = 52 ( 50 ema)  
  
so loading 13 ema of(higher timeframes) all timeframes in single chart will show 50 ema(lower timeframes) of all timeframes in single chart also  
  
for example 13 ema H4= 50 ema H1 ( higher timeframe 13 ema = lower time frames 50 ema, (for synchronised timeframes M1,M5,M15,H1,H4)  
  
so you are looking at 13 ema of all timeframes in this templet = you are looking at 50 ema of all timeframes  
and prices bounces from 50 ema of one timeframe to 50 ema of other timeframes  
  
50 ema is from where next move starts  
  
================================================================================================  
when all timeframes moving averages align in one direction then you have a move which is tradable. when all higher timeframes are aligned you can draw trendline and move will be available to trade at the break of the trendline in the direction of trend( in the direction of aligned higher timeframes moving averages)  
you need to pay attention to price action more then on any indicators as indicators will be late to react and market is fast to move, if you want to enter on when there is signal on indicator then you will enter late and already most of the move on the swing is done with.  
  
so basically you can trade with moving averages, trendline and price action.(higher top higher bottom and lower top lower bottom)  
  
and then mark (with real time data of call and put )highest open interest levels of call and put options on chart as lines (this are support and resistance levels) and then use real time data of orders traded on exchange to see when this support and resistance levels are violated by large orders, once there is convergence points of moving averages appears and trendline is violated.  
  
after convergence of moving averages is done, trendline violation is a point of entry in the direction of the higher timeframe trend.  
  
  
daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly close prices are strong support and resistance levels  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
TIME ZONE DIVISION--  
===============  
-best timeframes for analysis-  
-1)for instruments traded for 24 hours(factor of 4)-will be 15 minutes, 1 hour( 15 minutes X 4=60 minutes), 4 hour( 1 hour X 4= 4 hour).... like that, so 30 minutes is odd time frame to analyse , ( this will set time zone division for instruments for instruments traded for 24 hours like forex)  
-2) for instruments that are traded on only during exchange open hours( usually 6 hours approximately on all exchanges, 6hours X 4= 24 hours)  
(here also factor of 4) -here in this case 15 minutes time frame will equate to 1 hour time frame(60 minutes)(15 minutes x4) for instruments traded for 24 hours, and 1 hour time frame will equate to 4 hour time frame(1 hour x 4) for instruments traded for 24 hours duration, ..... so on  
  
  
\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
PRICE ZONE DIVISION-  
================  
Apply factor of 4 on moving average to get better entry points,  
basics of division- for crucial 13 , 50 ,200 ema(factor of 4 as with time zones to get synchronization with time zones)-13 ema x4=52 (50 ema), 50 emaX4= 200 ema  
  
so on above formula,  
1)for instruments traded for 24 hours- 50 ema on 1 hourly chart=13 ema on 4 hourly chart( factor of 4 for both price zones and time zones)  
\- 200 ema to 1 hourly chart= 50 ema on 4 hourly chart( again,factor of 4 for both price zones and timezones)  
....so 0n for other time frames also  
-2) for instruments that are traded on only during exchange open hours( usually 6 hours approximately on all exchanges, 6hours X 4= 24 hours)  
\- 50 ema on 15 minutes chart=13 ema on 1 hourly chart(60 minutes)( factor of 4 for both price zones and time zones)  
-200 ema on 15 minutes chart = 50 ema on 1 hourly chart( again,factor of 4 for both price zones and timezones)  
so on for other time frames also,  
  
so this is how system is based , it revolves around on equal time and price division, magic factor here is -4  
you will find now 5 minutes,15 minutes, 1 hourly and 4 hourly charts in sync with this system indicators, (30 minutes time frame will not be in sysn with the system as it does not fall into equal division of time and price zones)  
\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
convergence of moving averages 13 ema and 50 ema provides best entry points.  
best entry points and to avoid sideways markets -- all time frame averages to converge(all higher time frame trend to align) as much as possible and then to see moving averages to converge on time frames as explained above, to minimise risk and improve reward probability.  
  
  
where are low risk entry points and anticipating next fast price action  
\- at convergence of moving averages 13 and 50 ema( at this points there is maximum convergence of all lower timeframes with maximum compression of prices of all lower time frames, so one can anticipate price expansion ahead)  
\-----------------------  
  
  
MOVING AVERAGES AND TIME ZONE DIVISION  
( equal division of price zones and time zones by factor - 4)( to match for all crucial H4 candle closing timing, as major exchange like US, london and tokyo's session opeing and closing time falls on closing hours of H4 candles where most of moves comes)( last few moments on any candle is very important for decisive move to take place)(opening and closing time of exchanges is where volume is generated, opening price is set up by amatuer traders and closing prices on exchange is set up by professional trades)( closing prices of session is the price which is the closest to the interbank close price)  
______________________________________________  
___________________________________________________  
  
50 ema Daily =13 ema Weelky = 5 ema monthly  
200 ema Daily = 50 ema weekly = 13 ema monthly = 5 ema quarterly  
200 ema weekly = 50 ema monthly = 13 ema quarterly =5 ema yearly  
200 ema monthly= 50 ema quarterly= 13 ema yearly  
\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
for instruments traded 24 hours like forex( for charts available all 24 hours)  
  
13 ema D1 = 50 ema H4(exact is 50 ema H6) = 200 ema H1  
13 ema H4 = 50 ema H1 = 200 ema M15  
13 ema H1 =50 ema M15 = 200 ema M5  
13 ema M15 = 50 ema M5 = 200 ema M1  
\-------------------------------------------------------------------  
for instruments traded during exchange open time( for charts available only during exchange open time)  
13 ema D1 = 50 ema H1 =200 ema M15  
13 ema H1 =50 ema M15 = 200 ema M5  
13 ema M15 = 50 ema M5 = 200 ema M1  
______---------------------------------------  
  
  
so H4 of 24 hours traded instruments = H1 of instrument traded only on exchange hours  
so H1 of 24 hours traded instruments = M15 of instrument traded only on exchange hours  
\--------------------------------------------------------------------------  
so match H4 chart of forex (24 hours chart) to H1 chart of same forex pair with chart available during exchange open time, for better execution when both charts align you have a move available to trade  
\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  
note- M30 is the oddest time frame to trade, avoid trading on this time frame.  
\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
zone between 13 ema and 20 ema is all important for short term swing to end, if prices dips below this zone and does not come back above it fast in next few candles , brace for reversal to come and break of this 13 ema and 20 ema zone will flip atr of prices to other side.( usually with large and fast price action bar that will less likely to reverse as it breaks multiple timeframe averages, in one bar, and catches all traders to wrong side and sets panic in traders to make them square off their positions )  
  
\------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
in all time frames 50 ema is the equilibrium point, from where next price action begins and price strength comes  
50 ema = 50 level on rsi (14) = centerline of macd= centerline of stlm histogram  
\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
as 13 ema and 20 ema zone is all important, as start and end of swing, it is all about convergence and divergence of this zones in multiple timeframes(qwma set as this 13-20 ema zones, loaded all timeframes qwma in single chart = all timeframes swings in single chart)  
  
  
price action is of paramount importance for break of trendline(on closing basis) and for initiation of trade., around 70 % of times prices will pull back towards trendline to give better entry points after prices breaks trendline on closing basis of candle( this candle should be a large one and fast one)( to catch traders on wrong side suddenly and offguard, so that panic sets in the traders (counter trend traders and sideways market traders)and they rush in to square off their positions. at convergence of moving averages before prices starts its next move, it forms double top or double bottom commonly (and this tops are where stop loss should be) and then runs to break trendline.  
  
rough estimate of targets-- length of consolidation ( draw horizontal line of length of consolidation and put the same line on vertically, ) that is your minimum targets.  
  
prices tend to pull back towards the previous days close prices often before resuming its move for the day, as previous days close price is the most important for major banks,( interbank close), so is very important is the close at US market closing prices,  
and exchange close price for stocks and indexes  
  
for any country's currency, two close price are important  
one is where is the close price on that country's interbank platform close. and other is where is close price of that country's currency on US session close(as that is decisive for daily candle close)  
depending on how is closing on us session , the next day prices will open on that country's interbank platform and then will pull back to the previous day's close price on that country's interbank platform, and then again restart the move for the day in the direction of the trend.  
this is also true for any other instrument like stocks and indexes  
only in <10% of the time when there is very strong trend that this pull back to country's interbank close price level will be shallow.  
  
  
price and volume move will come at  
london open  
tokyo close  
us open  
london close  
us open  
  
  
reliable volume is generate when there is interbank or market closing and opening hours overlap on major country sessions, that synchronizes with H4 candle close, and that is when good price action is anticipated.  
like, tokyo close and london open overlap  
london close and us open overlap  
us close.  
  
now H4 trend changes when lower timeframes starts aligning, like slowly 15 minutes, 16 minutes, 17 minutes, 18 minutes..............H1,H2, H3 timeframes slowly starts aligning in one direction (this is what histogram shows)  
when all lower timeframes aligned, there appears big and fast price bar on chart and throws atr of prices(and so moving averages ) of all lower timeframes to other side as all timeframe crucial moving averages are breached in single bar, this large price bar sets panic among traders as they are now caught off guard and rush to close positions, this propels the reversal on chart in form of fast and large price action bar, mostly running fast to breach trendline  
this reversal also gets reflected on macd histogram as cross of histogram above or below zero line(or cross of macd line and macd signal line)  
  
so now the option to find out when trend is going to change and anticipate trend change coming is -one assess all lower timeframes below H4 turning on multiple timeframes chart like H3,H2,H1 ..... or to see on single chart with macd histogram of H4 timeframe, .( now with jurik smooth ribbon showing all timeframe trend in single chart of all timeframes i need not open all chart below H4 to see when they are aligning using qwma on single chart.  
  
so one option is to synchronize all time frames in one single chart to see what is going on in diffenet timeframes and read it on one chart( like with qwma in above templets)  
or the other option is to analyze all timeframes chart one by one to see what is status of trend on different timeframes.  
  
  
so when macd line and macd signal line touches each other, that shows that all lower timeframes have reached alignment and big price bar is coming soon, direction of which is set by higher timeframe trend.  
now if this all timeframe trends have aligned at points of convergence points of moving averages in multiple timeframes, then divergence with large price action bar is coming( good entry points at convergence points)  
  
do not take trades when there is divergence of moving average already done, as this will again mean align to equilibrium point 50 ema in counter trend way retracement, again wait for convergence points on moving averages to appear.  
  
now as both macd and stlm histogram are slow to react to price action as any other indicator and market is fast, so for entry i use price action( as above all timeframens aligns at convergence points , anticipate big price action in direction of trend, but this is just anticipation, and draw a trendline from one macd line cross point to other cross point, means lower timeframes strength points to lower timeframes weakening point,, once prices starts running fast with big price bar running to break trendline, that means all counter trend traders and sideways market traders are now stuck, be ready to open up position at break of trendline, prices usually stops at trendline after candle closes, and gives good entry point there, trendline break confirms reversal  
  
timeframes that can be coupled are H4-H1, H1-M15, M15-M5, M5-M1, which ever timeframe you are trading, M30 does not fit with macd and moving averages atr of prices(13-20 ema zone on each timeframe)  
  
\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
more the timeframes aligned more stronger move is expected.  
more the higher timeframes aligned, more longer trend will emerge.  
\--------------------------------------------------------------------------  
find out convergence points on instruments that is trending and then take trade as explained above.  
loading moving average as posted previously or loading qwma adaptive fls(previously posted templet and indicators here on this thread) shows convergence points in all timeframes in single chart   
  
stlm histogram and macd are for momentum change showing and multiple timeframe alignment only,  
entry to trade is with price action , as price candle displays much information, and only take positions in trending market and only in direction of trend, so that even entry is bit wrong trend will take care of it.  
spikes that comes above or below this convergence points (before start of move), on moving averages will not be tested if i have taken right trade and position will be in profit immediately   
.  
  
if macd lines have fallen too far away from its centerline, price most likely will not cross back 50 ema immediately, it will first come back and mean reverse to 50 ema and consolidates there and then will try to attempt to cross it.  
market moves for convergence to divergence and macd shows the same , market is that regular in its behaviour from alternate convergence and divergence. higher time frames decides in which direction next convergence and divergence will come  
  
  
moving averages  
5, 13(13-20 ema zones), 50 and 200 ema (as it is more synchronized with time frames H4, H1, M15, M5 and M1)  
\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
200 ema to find long term trend, 50 ema to find medium trend, 13-20 ema to find swings, and 5 ema( or macd line ) to catch price action(or just use purely price action reading)  
  
for example of H4-H1 trading  
for catching H4 swings, 13 ema H4 (13-20 zones) will catch it.  
now H4 13 ema = 50 ema on H1 chart, so till prices are above 50 ema of H1 chart you are in upswing on H4 chart , any move towards 50 ema on H1 chart is buying opportunity.  
\----------------------------------------------------------------------------  
reverse for down swing  
  
macd lines-  
  
macd line = 5 ema  
macd signal line =13 ema  
macd center line=50 ema  
\- so H1 upswing starts with up cross of macd line and macd signal line on H4(i.e upcross of 5 ema and 13 ema cross of H4= 13 ema and 50 ema upcross on H1) ,and ends with down cross of macd line and macd signal line cross of H4 (i.e downcross of 5 ema and 13 ema cross of H4= 13 ema and 50 ema down cross on H1)  
in between pullbacks of prices on 50 ema H1(= 13 ema H4= 100 ema M30= 200 ema M15) are buying opportunities  
price strength will emerge when macd line crosses its centerline  
  
it is when higher timeframes moving averages align( for upswing in this sequence yearly, quarterly, monthly, weekly, daily, H4, H1 when all moving averages align in up direction you will have a move in lower timeframes) , that is when lower timeframes moves.  
  
qwma set to show all timeframes swing zones and find out convergence of moving averages points in multiple timeframes  
qwma set to match 13-20 ema zones.  
with above posted indicators added.   
if you want to see all timeframes swings in single chart  
\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
this zones 13-20 ema zones are the ones from which prices react  
and this zones are potential target areas.  
convergence points are entry points in direction of higher timeframe zones.  
  
  
ultimately its the context of moving averages in all timeframes , each moving average represents a timeframe  
macd just represents convergence and divergence of moving averages only  
  
13 * 4=52 ema( 50 ema)  
  
15 minutes * 4 = 60 minutes  
  
so multiplication or division by factor 4 is equal division of moving averages and timeframes  
  
algo or program trading does not change the overall market structure , it is just a faster execution of orders but then at which point in history was mr. market slow !! algo are run in direction of the trend.

Then only problem I think is, Indicators names you attached and indicators used in the Template could be different.  
  
Ok I think i found the problem.   
  
You are using the Downloads\Indicator  
"name=Downloads\FX Sniper's MA"  
  
Indicators should in indicators folder of MQL4 folder. So thats why your templates are not working.

Hello. Looks fantastic. Before I download all the indicators, wanted to see if the Arrow indicators send alerts via e-mail or push. Or is it the pop up alert only?  
  
Thank you in advance.

all but just indicators?? no trading examples on entry exit? Just looking at the indicators are easy but catching it on real price doesnt work specially when the market is ranging.

hello, mario 777  
  
here is trade example,   
  
in the image at red vertical line, golden line is broken so the trend is changing to downside from up.  
  
also indicators in lower panel are aligning with red colored price bar and red color on indicators also,  
  
so the signal to sell is appearing  
  
now waiting for price to bounce towards golden line and pink color cloud increases risk reward . see the price hitting pink cloud and under surface of golden line. marked by circle.  
  
sell at this level as all criteria of system are met and generates sell signal. also in lower most indicator panel sell only appears.  
  
with stoploss levels, support level and target price displayed as in image trade to sell is available.

on more follow up  
  
price trying to bounce back from support level but system still generating sell mode so keep trailing stopless down at lower border of cloud . as histogram of pink color cloud is still posting lower bars on its histogram. so prices are still not turning.

now you can see target price is achived.  
  
and it is wise to book profit here.  
  
other option is to wait till system generates next buy signal with much tighter stoploss.

still no buy signal,  
  
but stlm histogram looks very extended. counter buy move can come at any time or sharp sell off may follow.

now stlm histogram is generating buy signal, blue bar is appearing.  
  
book all profit and go on sideline. wait for another signal generation to come in direction of trend.  
  
so that completes the discussion of example

Hello,  
  
how it is possible to desactivate the alerts coming out every seconds please ?  
  
Would it be possible to allow the renaming of the initial indicator named: Macd averages tape 1.1.ex4  
  
It is much more convenient to be able to rename a group of indicator in order to see them all packed together in the indicator list.  
  
  
Which timeframe do you trade most please ?  
  
How many pips are you searching per trade with your system ?  
  
Thanks.

hello,  
meko  
  
in such conditions when market is sideways mj indicator will help .  
  
the reason why i added mj indicator to sniper rishijay trading system is to filter false trades.  
  
mj indicator will show major trend is up of down , or sideways no major trend identified warning.  
  
so in your example mj indicator will throw warning that no major trend identified. wait till it shows major trend down signal.  
  
in my above example i do waited till it shows major trend down.  
  
in my above example in 1 st image you can see that it was showing no major trend identified though the set up was right to sell. it is only that it showed major trend down signal( image 2) in case of my example that all indicators were aligning with mj indicator. and that was right trade.  
  
so best trade is when all indicators align. no single indicator is left out without aligning.  
  
in any case i find lower timeframes like 1 minute , 5 minutes, or even to rightly speak 15 minutes unconfortable to trade on any trading system as it is difficult to be profitable every time. you can earn profit once or twice on lower time frame but when markets hits you in opposite direction trading in such lower time frames hits you very badly as it gives you very little time to exit positions.  
  
  
in sideways markets no trading system of world will be able to generate profit consistently. mj indicator helps out partly to remain out of sideways market.

in your above example,  
  
after prices hit undersurface of gold line and then trying to fall --- at that time you can see that stlm histogram was generating blue bar immediately, it should have remained red also to validate continuation of sell signal while we wait for mj indicator to throw sell signal.  
  
so that was another warning that this sell signal may not be right in sideways market.  
  
you can also see the importance of stlm histogram as it reacts faster then even macd to warn you in any trend.  
  
stlm histogram is faster then macd for signal generation when trend is about to reverse.

hello mianlien  
  
what i have observed with supertrend indicator with following settings-- nbr period-10 and multiplier-1.7 is that it behaves like EMA=20, but gives exit early.  
  
so i personally overlap supertrend indicator with above settings with sniper rishijay trading system .  
  
as this settings matches optimally with other sniper rishijay trading system indicators.  
  
it gives exit early before actually prices breaks lower border of cloud and then breaks 20 period ema.  
  
so i use it for exit signal with rest of the sniper rishijay trading system.  
  
also i use it for trailing stoploss as it adjusts near prices more quickly then actual 20 period ema. so gives idea to set much tighter stoploss then even lower border of cloud and 20 period ema.  
  
so thats two advantages of supertrend indicator with which i use it. you can load it on chart with sniper rishijay trading system and observe it yourself and set its settings as per your trading style.  
  
i have not included more indicators with the system so that chart screen does not look clumsy.  
  
so posting many other indicators separately so any one can try it out separately and use it according to their trading style.

Brijesh,  
  
Can you post Template picture when you have added new indicators, so that we can see what you are doing. It might be much easier to understand your point.

hello,  
cdsaa ,  
  
to elaborate it further ,  
  
how with price movement sniper rishijay system calculations projects,  
  
for example, if trend is up and now it started reversing,  
  
1) -then first lower border of macd cloud is broken( 1 st stoploss) (with super trend helping in early exit) , followed by break of center line of bollinger band(which nearly equates to 20 ema) , so it is short term trend reversing.  
  
2) then golden line breaks(absolute stoploss)-- intermediate term trend reversal  
  
3)200 ema breaks-- bear market territory.  
\-----------------------------------------------------------  
reverse is true for opposite change to trend.  
\---------------------------------------------------------  
mj indicator and bollinger band helps to decide whether market is trending or ranging.

\--color difference near prices shows convergence and divergence of 13 ema and 26 ema  
  
\-- cloud border equates to 50 ema  
  
1) step-1 = load ytg dvemanski indicator on chart with settings---- --ma1=13,ma2=50,method=1, price=0, signal=9, smethod=0, signal2=70, smethod2=0, color1=dark slate blue, color2= firebrick , color3= none, color4=none.  
  
step-2 = overlap another copy of ytg dvemanski indicator on chart with settings-----ma1=26,ma2=50,method=1, price=0, signal=9, smethod=0, signal2=70, smethod2=0, color1=dodger blue, color2= linen , color3= none, color4=none.  
  
2) fxsnipers moving settings with it--  
-moving average1( to match with 50 ema and cloud)---ma type=1, ma period=50, ma shift-0, price type=0 ,  
  
-moving average 2(to match 13 ema and cloud)-- ma type=1, maperiod=13, ma shift=0, price type=0 ,

Hi,  
You dont need all these indicators, sorry but it's a ridiculous "christmas tree"  
Everyone with a bit of experience knows that it is no use to multiply, complicate the chart  
Here one of my simplest systems  
Do not repaint!

Before i have a look at D1 and H4 on 10 majors  
And take and manage a basket ... the management is always the most important  
  
But agree with you, play with what you want. If christmas tree is good for you ... ok play with a christmas tree  
  
no problem  
see you

Another more Christmas tree system like thousands here. Dozen of colors and indis, and not seeing what price is doing, price is always the king. 

Indicators always obey Price, not the other way.

hello,  
maxtrader and le celte  
  
if you feel you have better system then others and you think you have point to prove it,  
  
it is best to put your indicators and templets in thread and let other traders use it and then let them comment on it to have unbiased opinion.  
  
if you can not put your system on thread then i do not know how other traders are going to take your comments ? with pinch of salt !!

This is exactly the problem, you trust too much lagging and leading "indicators". Do you want me to suggest an indicator? Ok I will suggest none of them, see a chart, and in case of any doubt ask a little kid and tell him, is it going down or up? And i can bet that the kid will be right almost 80% of time.  
If I would recommend and indicator i would suggest your mind, do you really need an indicator to see lower lows,lower highs, higher lows and higher highs?  
Anyway, sorry keep adding more indis to your system, it is valid, but listen to more than 15 years trading. Do you think that big players like City or Deutsche Bank see what Big Macd is pointing? Just a friendly question, i really want you to save years of experimenting all those colorful systems, but anyway just my thoughts, I wish you many pips.  
Regards

Indicators always obey Price, not the other way.

Salut le clown,  
In France one would say of you: "you do not lack air". Vous ne manquez pas d'air !  
You only post a series of dozens and tens of very colorful indicators and where do you explain when to enter and leave?  
Or explain money management?  
Where did you post a template that works and matches your strategy?  
What strategy?  
You are a poor clown without any skill  
But please continue to post here hundreds of indicators following each other if that is your pleasure  
But please do not tell me it's a system!  
  
Yes I posted here on the SHF and Bunker Forums complete systems and not as you a silly suite of colorful indicators  
  
good luck ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44e.png?v=15.1)

It is pretty obvious that English is not my mother language, but I can speak fluently 3 languages, it is an international forum in case you have not noticed it, there are people from many, many countries, so don't expect that everyone will speak English as if it were their mother language, also what you think about my English is one of the 80000 things in life that I don't give a shi...... I hope that now you can understand my limited English. 

Indicators always obey Price, not the other way.

Maxtrader I don't care what you give a shi... in your life. FYI I speak 5 main and 2 regional languages and English is not my mother tongue too. I only care about individuals attitude towards other people and obviously, yours sucks... get well soon.

Well I never insulted anyone until you showed your stupid comment about languages, you too get well and stop med.

Hi Astroartpdx!   
  
Please, kindly attach a template that includes the Dynamic Zone EFT macd averages smoothed indicator.  
  
I do have issue of seeing all copied and past indicators in my indicator list.  
  
Thank you. 

It's not what you DO, it's HOW you do it.

hello, luizschiavi,  
  
to explain shortly how indicators of sniper rishijay system works--  
\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
this system is based on macd indicator system with creation of cloud and golden line on chart.  
  
cloud shows convergence and divergence of 12 ema and 26 ema.  
  
golden line equates to center line of regular macd.  
  
cloud has been set with such a settings that in trending market it filters whipsaws of macd and will keep you in trend for more time.  
  
best way to understand sniper rishijay trading system is to observe it functioning with macd.  
  
macd is also in built with the sniper rishijay trading system if you download the rar file.  
  
price bar color coding is done in such a way so as to give easy entry and exit by seeing color of price candle.  
\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
  
  
stoploss-  
========  
lower border of cloud is 1 st stoploss, and golden line is absolute stoploss for any trade.  
  
\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
trend is up when price and cloud is above golden line.  
trend is down when price and cloud is below golden line  
\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
  
other indicators -  
\---------------------  
  
price reversal indicator-  
====================  
stlm histogram- helps in entry and exit and shows reversal of price trends along with macd and cloud with golden line.

hello,  
astroartpdx,  
  
dll file is posted at post-177, put it in library folder. this dll file is needed for functioning of dynamic zone indicators posted already and for that indicators that will be posted on this thread in future.  
recently posted indicator above though does not need dll file but better to download dll file and put it in library folder so that in future you may not need to do it again when i post other dynamic zone indicators in future on this thread.

Thank you Brijeshsinh, you can edit tlp-file on every textfile editor *.txt. It's easier for all, if templates are posted especially on post 1 (please edit), that does not refer to subdirectories (you used indicators/Downloads) in indicators for those who don't want to read many posts. It's also easier to exchange tlps on other threads if not everybody makes other subdirectories.  
On last pages you posted many indicators. What is the actual professional working template or at least the settings? Are the rules the same? None of the indicators repaint?

Sorry, but I just see many pics and indicators. Please post the template *.tlp file of your latest versions, also the professional version, so that we can talk about the same. The last version on your old thread looks different also. Will be no problem, if the indicators have to be put in indicators\Downloads folder.  
  
Great work so far, are the many indicators you don't use not as good as the ones used now? **No indicator of the indicators in the pics repaints except tmaslope.**  
mj is sometimes changing every bar, I Think tma slope is the better option to filter sideways, but that repaints. Maybe the great Averages Keltner Channels 2.ex4 of mladen with many ma-options is a visual help (no mq4 file available).  
I post this 2017 version of mrtools stlm from forex-station, you used in the past.  
Also my Heijden, if you like to few the bars clearer, alarms everytime, when timeframe is changed, but that can somebody fix.

Another better supertrend from the great coder mladen, but as sl keltner bands are better, because they still show after every spike good sl values on **both** sides.  
  
Green and red lines are the normal supertrend on Brijeshsinhs pictures, green orange seems to be step averages. Here the newest versions with 30 different possible ma.

hello,  
friend4you,  
  
there is no indicator available as holygrail that tells anyone in advance that prices are going to fall in range(sideways market).   
  
it is only that range is formed then we come to know that now prices are not trending.  
  
so if you have any indicator that helps parlty or wholely in identifying ranging market then also you are welcomed to post it here.

Sure, will post some templates soon to filter sideways, I'm still checking your indicators, but I know many of them since years and some are quite popular.  
  
So, you don't use the last template of your old thread or any template with much more indicators any more?  
It would be great, if you could post or mail me some actual templates, I can post them (also without the need to put indicators to indicators\Downloads folder) if you want. These averages indicators have lots of options.  
My bands should also be good to have more trading chances with the trend than the few color changes your system suggests.  
Are there rules for take half profits or exit or change of sl? Risc management is very important.  
Thanks.

hello, fxdragon,  
  
trading rules are the same.  
  
i am testing that indicator that you are referring to with sniper rishijay trading system.  
in primary testing it appears to be promising as trailing stop loss mechanism in trending market as it is filtering whipsaws well.  
  
of course further testing by individual trader is advised before using it.

hello, friend4you,  
  
from your obsevations that you have posted regarding sniper rishijay trading system it appears that you are fine technical analyst and it appears that you have understood functioning of sniper rishijay trading system well.  
  
so adding some fine points that now you can observe of sniper rishijay trading system.  
  
1) uptrend cloud (blue color) has been deliberately made faster then downtrend cloud(magenta color)  
  
-reason behind it is that when prices falls after reversal from uptrend it falls faster as compared to price rise occuring after reversal of downtrend(price upmove is slower)  
  
so making uptrend cloud faster gives me faster exit when there is sharp fall of prices  
  
making downtrend cloud slower gives me entry from reversal of downtrend when everyone is in buying mode and cloud is indicating the same.  
  
as i want faster exit when prices falls and a bit slower entry when prices starts of go up.  
  
2) best trades are to trade dark blue color bars in uptrend when other indicators are in sync  
  
-and trade red color bars in downtrend when other indicators are in sync  
  
3) rest of color price bars are indicator of part profit booking or complete exit of all positions they are not to be used for taking entry of new trade.  
  
4) adding 200 ema with sniper rishijay trading system gives better visibility of ongoing trend in context to long term trend.

hello,  
  
friend4you,  
  
some templets that you have asked for with older version of sniper rishijay trading system and its useful combinations with other indicators are posted below  
  
you can check them also.  
  
this templets will work only with indicators\Downloads folder subdirectory link. this you are already knowing by now.  
  
as they are aimed to catch trending market they are useful still.  
  
big simmering question with any trading system always is when market is ranging !!

Thanks, you seem to like ma and macd :-)  
The problem with them is and I trade with them many years, that you have to adjust them, if you trade a much ranging pair instead of a volatile one. That keltner (older versions were called atr-bands) uses ATR (Average True Range, the volatility) for calculation and is compensating that. It can work on every pair.  
Please experiment with the settings and also with a second keltner representing a higher timeframe by a much higher settings, where the pair normally stops with the momentum. There I exit or when price is spiking above that band. When this wider and slower second band is horizontal, I stop trading a trend system, because we go sideways. You can make range trading there with other systems. I show you one narrow setting in the picture. As long this middle line (lwma here) keeps going up, you can trade more longs near the lower band with sl at the line. I advise to go on a shorter timeframe to wait for a reversal of prices up before the lower band, then price respects the uptrend. Otherwise, there is a stonger downtrend and you should not catch that falling knife.

The templates are helpful, maybe you can rar or zip your indicators/Downloads-folder without hawkeyes indicators, otherwise we have to find all *.ex4-files in the internet.  
Btw, more than five indicators confuse more than help or you can trade only very few times, if they all should agree and also then, we can be in a range.  
  
Your "best" template for example needs  
SuperTrend  
AllAverages_v2.5_Distance  
SuperTrend nrp new mtf 2  
Period_Converter_Opt-1  
a_candle  
mj  
ArrowsAndCurves  
AllAverages_v2.5_Distance  
obo_trendbars-2  
!XPS v8 TRENDBARS

hello, friend4 you,  
  
  
making download folder of mine to rar and uploading here will be very big file  
  
so instead posting here breakdown folder that will contain related indicators with templets,  
check it out.  
  
yes you are right when average true range is low-ranging market , it is not profitable  
  
it is only when market is trending that profit is made.  
i will check out keltner channel.

This is EURUSD 30 min and how I made the settings of atr-bands or the newer keltner version years ago. I did not change it like many ea programmer make their work fit today's volatility to show better backtest results. These bands work on every timeframe. Watch the thicker brown bands on Longs:  
Exit half after outbreaks or at upper band, because prices are overbought, change sl for a bigger target from the thinner bands to the bigger lines.  
See how the bands work as flexibel support and resistance lines based on actual volatility.  
Best is, it filters ranges to avoid trading.  
Make your tests by scrolling many pairs back, which values would you use for the bands?

hello,  
friend4 you,  
  
i do use bollinger bands to identify ranging markets with sniper rishijay system but have not experimented with keltner channels much especially with multitimeframe settings so far.  
  
so will try to check out with keltner channel with sniper rishijay system.  
  
if you have any suggestions regarding settings of keltner channel with sniper rishijay system do suggest, as i think you will be right person to suggest better settings of keltner channel with sniper rishijay system because you are using it since long so have better idea of keltner channel.   
  
i will be happy to test that settings of yours of keltner channel in live markets with sniper rishijay trading system.  
  
thanks for your suggestions.

You can see the settings in this post.  
[https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...3#post10295783](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=10295783#post10295783)  
Using indicators in multi-timeframe-mode (mtf) does not help much, because last lines will change until higher tf closes its candle, but it's an option. I suggest to choose for the thicker line just higher settings. Because we should discuss both settings, it would be good, if many here make their homework and post their settings, that fit these rules I posted yesterday. For example to change sl after tp1 to a wider level to get most of the move. It should give additional information to the thiner line of the longer trend. There are no best settings. Later I may post also my second settings, but I don't want that we are just copying me. I post the little faster keltner indicator "atr bands", but the standard settings are not as good.  
  
Why are for you the xps trendbars better better than other colored bars like ob? How do you interpretate the combination in your templates? The snipers MA is just a colored MA.  
I think the macd averages has more settings. EMA is fast, but an indicator should also be slow and adaptive, that means such indicators behave more or less fast depending on the last bigger waves of the charts. This feature is included in mladens second band indicator with also filters, that ignores smaller changes. But higher values than 1,5 change the middle line in steps at some places. Try averages - mtf - alerts 8.3 - atr bands.ex4, it is similar to that keltner, I posted. But the name is not correct, keltner did not use atr, just standard deviation. There are many books about the german bollinger like trading breakouts (the posted keltner can alarm after a candle outside the channel, where also a good trend can start). His bands spreaden on strong trends in both directions, that's not usable for smaller sl at the lines. That's why I prefer the newer versions. On mobile devices, you can use bollinger sma 13 and deviation 1,5, which is similar and better than the standard 20 1,5.  
  
I think, this thread should get more attention, because we all can benefit from opinions or indicators of others.

Hello,  
friend4you,  
  
reason for using xps trendbars for color coding is that, i wanted to visualise pullback candles to book part profit in an ongoing trending market.  
  
i tried many indicators like obotrend bars, moving average color bars, hama system bars, pallada bars etc, but found xps trendbars the fastest.  
  
see the image attached below where i have marked candle with color change with rectangle , this are part profit booking candle if you do not want to be greedy. i found this candle appearing fastest with xps trend bars.  
  
infact in previous older version of sniper rishijay system i had overlapped obotrend bars for similar color candle for profit booking , that i found bit slower then xps trendbars, so i reverted to xps trendbars.  
  
for part profit booking i see immediate lower timeframe , if in lower time frame sniper rishijay system is generating sell signal and if current time frame is showing color change on price bar as is shown in attached image( in rectangles drawn) then i book part profit .   
  
that was the reason for creating colored price bars with xps indicator for immediate visualisation.  
  
  
also supertrend indicator with settings - nbr-10. multiplier-1.7 gives me faster exit with this xps color change on candle and this supertrend settings matches with xps color bar change also,  
  
i used bollinger bands as overtime i found it gives indications of ranging market comparatively earlier then other channel indicators. but now needs to test keltner channels as per your settings.  
  
i used sniprer ma as i wanted to create border of cloud and that also changes color for partial profit booking with coloring of price bars.  
so color change on sniper ma with change of color of price pars gives me idea about partial profit booking.  
  
so above and over this system indicators, super trend, bollinger bands and 200 ema these three extra indicators i use help me in exit and to find range and trend.

Hello Brijeshsinh!  
You should activate the bands (atr period 10, then upper /lower bands both 1.1) , otherwise it's the normal averages indicator. You should not just choose indicators that present up and down of price best, you should use some, that tell you, when the next bars will still be up and a bigger move is more likely to come, even if I missed first entry on touch-line for example. Oscilators crossing 0 can do that like old cci (commodity channel index). Many pictures on boards just show good trends, but 70 % of the time, price is not trending strong, but your indicators still make buy signals.  
Obo just colors the bars in similar way then other bar indicators.

hello, friend4you,  
  
yes you are absolutely right, whenever there is going to be strong move coming , first trend reversal bar is likely to be big enough to cross many short term averages and will be followed by many follow-up good bars.  
  
for this kind of reversal i use one indicator hawkeye widebar. this demonstrates clearly your mentioned kind of entry and follow up. this bar most often demonstrates significant price and volume action.  
  
this gives me the same kind of entry as you said. i enter on subsequent retracement of price once move is confirmed by hawkeye widebar indicator.  
  
yes you are right 70% time market is ranging and it is only 30% of times that prices are trending on any given time scale. it is this 30% time that is profitable.  
  
as you mentioned crooss of 0 line in cci gives positive signals , i use macd centerline crossover instead, for strong signal to catch the right move. cci 0 line cross or macd center line cross more or less is no different broadly.  
  
due to some so called copyright issues by hawkeye traders in previous old thread it has been removed and so i have avoided posting it here in this thread also.   
  
so can not post it here.  
  
but you can find it on internet and try it out.  
  
as you know mladen the great coder well. i think you must be knowing his website forex station. it is there also.

hello, friend4you,  
  
i have tested all averages on macd tape.  
  
aherens averages filters whipsaws well but legs a bit. lwma fares well but many times gives whipsaws also. so there are advantages and disadvantages.  
  
if you find some averages on macd tape interesting do suggest with its settings,  
  
i will test it out as per your settings.  
  
for matter of fact if you find any other settings useful on any other indicator on sniper rishijay trading system you can upload indicators or if you want you can post your revised templet of sniper rishijay system on this thread.   
  
the aim here is to improvise sniper rishijay trading system by adding, removing or updating settings of indicators of system.  
  
any one here on forexfactory is welcomed for that.  
  
thank you.

hello, friend4you,  
  
also will test with higher setting of atr band overlay,  
  
looks quite interesting compression and expansion of bands is showing trending activity well.  
  
the idea is good, the thing is to find out optimal settings for both atr bands.

Atr-bands, Averages Keltner Channels 2.ex4 and avergaes - atr bands are quite similar. EMA 14 on averages - atr bands (standard setting as you use) makes many false signals in my view. Using more than one on a chart just makes sense if you use also different settings for the middle line. On your pic, the bands are just always the same, just with a bigger distance from the line in the middle.  
Don't forget the oscillators.  
Nice, that I could help.

brijesh, when you give someting like this, it is always good to give the template. if it is still in testing, better make the name "testing_xxx v xx

hello, cdsaa,  
  
wait for the settings from friend4you,  
  
as his settings for EMA 14 on averages - atr bands will be better , as he is using it since long,  
  
once he gives his settings, i will make templet available for sure.  
  
i have not been using atr bands for long, so my settings may not be accurate for trading.

No. Your EMA 14 on averages - atr bands (standard setting as you use) makes many false signals in my view. My Settings are here:  
[https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...3#post10295783](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=10295783#post10295783)  
You can use the other bands indicators similar, linear weighted ma 12 on weighted close ATR 11 KATR 1.1  
On ATR Bands (fastest, but fewer options) that would be 12 3 4 10 1.1 0.  
  
AT the slower band, I like to hear, what you think looks best to take profit there for example as described earlier here.

You should not try to copy me, there are many options and I just found out about the newer atr band indicators I posted.  
GBPUSD 30 min from today with atr bands.mq4. Breakouts out of thick band makes most profit, but you should enter by stop buy not too early.

EURUSD 5 min, support and resistance lines in yellow are a kind of art, no best way there either, but they are more important than trendlines.

hello, friend 4you,  
  
tried with your averages mtf atr bands indicator, but was not able to form templet as is seen in your image.  
  
so thaught of preparing random sample templet on which you can do modifications.  
  
here attaching sample templet.  
  
now you can modify this templet as per your settings and upload it. or if you wish you can post your own templet.  
  
i think your settings of atr has generated enough of aura of curiosity for me and for other members of forexfactory, that is why i have uploaded templet for your easy modification.  
  
hope this will make it easy for you to change settings.  
  
looking forward to see your edited new templet.  
  
  
thanks.  
  
NOTE- THIS TEMPLET WILL WORK WITH INDICATORS-Downloads subdirectory link.

Ok, copy the posted indicators and ! ATR Bands 2 best.ex4 above to Downloads folder  
MQL4/indicators/Downloads/  
and NEW template to templates-folder.  
I just changed the red dotted averages bands and firebrick bands of ! ATR Bands 2 best.ex4.  
You can use the other bands indicators similar, linear weighted ma 12 on weighted close ATR 11 KATR 1.1  
On ATR Bands (fastest, but fewer options) that is 12 3 4 10 1.1 0.  
You can drag and drop "! ATR Bands 2 best.ex4" from mt4 navigator to any chart, I implemented the colors and values I used as tight bands. I did not change the averages white bands. Now you can experiment on the white bands, that the bands are never tighter than any following bar lows within the trend as sl.  
My picture would look similar to yours.  
Show us your settings of a much slower and wider band that fits also pullbacks so that we can ride longer trends.

hello, friend4you,  
  
in your image i see two types of bands,  
  
one with thin line (tighter and faster bands)  
  
other with thick line.(that you use for price breakout above bands)(slower and wider bands)  
  
new templet that i got shows only dotted red line band and white dotted line bands, thick line bands are not visible. am i missing something out of templet ?  
  
correct me if i am missing something.  
  
thanks for uploading corrected templet.

here is image after overlapping indicator[! ATR Bands 2 best.ex4](https://www.forexfactory.com/attachment.php/2484710?attachmentid=2484710&d=1505731407) on your templet. _it_ overlaps exactly on dotted red line bands.  
  
if i consider dotted red line as your wider bands then also i need settings on [! ATR Bands 2 best.ex4](https://www.forexfactory.com/attachment.php/2484710?attachmentid=2484710&d=1505731407) for making it tighter bands as is seen in your image.

As written, these bands are similar and differ only on the standard smoothing settings that I did not change. You can try the settings in the earlier posted settings picture.  
  
You all shall find out settings for the wider bands, more eyes see more.  
  
Wide bars do not occur as often to use it as an entry trigger.  
Any suggestions to filter sideways, dear readers?  
  
I like your ema 64 in some of your templates as I used 63 very often (3 times of popular 21). 34 is also a fibbonacci number and may fit like the yellow line of MACD3.  
How do you use these Heijden MACD3 exactly?  
Why don't you use MACDtape any more?

hello, friend4you,  
  
Heijden MACD3 golden line keeps me in trend as you can see in image. your observation of golden line is also right it is not exact 50 ema but it is between it and near fibbonacci number , so it is faster to react then conventional 50 ema.  
  
  
magenta diamond bars(hawkeye widebar) are high volume and price bars that helps in breakout also. also hawkeye heatmap indicator i also use . as per the claims of hawkeye traders that it shows price volume action, their claim is right and it is very accurate most of times for entry.  
  
as per previous discussion i can not upload it here but you can find it out on internet and on forex station and test it out.  
  
i think it will help you to trade in cases where you enter on breakout above your thick lined atr bands.  
\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
in uptrend aim is to trend price above blue cloud and blue color on macd tape with blue color price bars only  
  
in downtrend aim is to trend price below pink cloud, red color on macd tape and red color bars  
\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

hello, friend4you,  
  
golden line gives the first retracement to fibbonacci number , that retracement you can buy.  
  
so with this system i need not use fibbonacci overlap indicator to show me various fibbonacci levels that i previously was using. golden line auto adjusts for that purpose.  
  
now i need fibbonacci only to check complete trend reversal beyond 61.8 %

So, is this the way, your main chart looks like now (all our templates are on indictors in indicators/Downloads folder)?  
Thanks for your openness. I don't like, that others do not post much, just because you posted indicators you like. People have to exchange their experience, not just fetch many indicators and change systems every week. Losses are part of the game.  
The last indicators are also good. But many traders use just indicators that show similar things like the trend instead of using oscillators to filter times of ranging markets. Yours are good, but MACD3 just shows, that there WAS a stronger trend. Price can stay there. Therefore, I like these bands, I posted. The human eye can see with them ranges better than any indicator. Ask an EA-creator: It is difficultest thing to filter non-trending markets by calculations.  
We are on a good way.

hello, friend4you,  
  
you are right sideways markets are best filtered by human eyes.  
i do not use EA, as i find manual trading better to detect ranging markets. so you will not find EA in this thread.  
  
you still can post EA or indicators of your choice here.  
  
sniper rishijay trading system remains the same as posted with the same rules.  
  
my main chart looks like as it was with sniper rishijay system that is posted here. no change except for few things that i have already mentioned regarding hawkeye indicators as i find it useful.  
  
i am posting extra indicators here because i find it useful someway or other, so thaught of sharing it with others .  
  
you are always welcomed to give your ideas and views.  
  
as everyone knows, most difficult part of trading is to identify sideways market. any suggestions to filter sideways market is welcomed from any member.

hello, friend4you,  
  
regarding your question of templet that you have uploaded,  
  
the answer is yes, you have got the right indicator from internet, you will not find this indicator easily on internet, as the owner of it are very keen to get it removed from any thread as has happened in my older thread and older version of my system where i included it in my system.  
  
this indicator is nonrepainting and very useful too, if you are planning to use it check out raitis cy filter indicator(with default settings)(indicator is posted here on this thread) also with it. this gives better vision and many times faster entry also. i do cross check with this indicator also.

The template I posted should work, if you have the indicators and template posted now unpacked in indicators/Downloads-folder.  
The last template of Brijeshsinh is added here, it's not mine with 2 different bands. I still wait, what you all think of my ideas presented in the pictures of my last posts. I don't think that raitis helps much.

Good day guys. I really like the system and i think it could have a good future.  
  
But what I have to say is you have to get clear what a strategy you wanna trade you cant cut out all Ranges and trade the trend. To many filter will filter out most of great trades.  
  
Focus on its strengthes not weakness es.   
  
I will trade this system I like the colors. But I will better focus on money and trade management than get every trade correct ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f636.png?v=15.1)

Everyday better.

Change a line and compile mq4 again in Metaeditor. It occurs just, when you can see data in data field, but not on chart.  
  
With just ex4-files, you should ask the developer to do it.  
Some older mq4-files are not compatible to Mt 4. There will be no newer Mt 4 than 1090.

You shouldn't post just charts with strong ups and down like everywhere on boards. White dotted lines (my bands with super smoother as example, red green is middle line) say take profit while your indicators say strong trend look 21.25 12.00 on german DAX Ger30 5 min. Post your tlp with proposals for settings, traders.  
For what do you use hama, most lines are invisible?  
  
Step Ma is very fast, could a slower setting or my slower band keep us longer in trend instead of Heijden? Too much color is what many did not like, arlucad.  
Just my opinion, I don't want to make big changes to your system as this is yours. Eyes against sideways are good, but many will miss many good trades without alarms in time.

Hello,  
  
I like so much of DAX (GER30).....  
  
Do you have a specific strategy for DAX?  
Or What are you using in DAX?  
  
Could you share indicators and template?

hello, luizschiavi,  
  
nice to see you participating ,  
  
keep expressing, keep asking questions,  
  
you are far better then other readers who are still reluctant to participate and are on sidelines.  
  
your views and experience matters the most for us.  
  
keep sharing your ideas and experiences with us.  
  
even the smartest technical analysts go wrong many times,  
so there is nothing like sharing your views and getting it wrong sometimes.  
  
thanks.

you will only learn when you start asking questions.  
  
friend4you has asked questions on finer points on sniper rishijay tradings system, so i have to give answers and there starts learning process.  
  
otherwise what will happen is that i will keep posting indiators and everyone on sidelines will keep downloading it. thats it. no learning.  
  
friend4you was able to ask questions because he must be keen observer and must be fine technical analysts, and must have observed sniper rishijay trading system closely.

there are many fine points that are still of sniper rishijay trading system that helps filter sideways markets , helps trade breakout from this ranges that yet no one has asked about.  
  
i have always ran away in past to include any tma based indicator in my system because of well known recalculating nature of tma.  
  
the reason of inclusion of tma indicator in sniper rishijay trading system is not to identify ranges only but the reasons are different.

when range forms there remains trendline of that range, usually when this range breaks that trendline is taken away. but that move is much faster and difficult to catch,  
  
to catch that move you need some forward looking indicator that signals that before other indicators of sniper rishijay system aligns for that moves, there comes the role of tma slope indicator.  
..  
if you combine tma slope with Dynamic zones EFT macd averages smoothed indicator of mladen(totally nonrepainting) you can exit before actual range starts forming, you can filter sideways market and can enter early when breakout from that range happens.  
  
Dynamic zones EFT macd averages smoothed indicator of mladen has already posted in this thread but no one have taken notice of it.  
  
i am posting indicators settings also with the indicator so that you can test it out and find help from it.  
  
now after reading this post what will happen at the most that someone from sidelines will jump in and will ask where is the indicator, please post the indicator and templet here without bothering to test it.

there is other useful role of tma slope indicator also,  
  
hint here is golden line equate to-- all subwindow indicator's centerline.  
  
now observe with this perspective.

You are totally right with what you say, also about the users like bees just collecting indicators to find the holy grail. But the main problem is before the PC like emotions, no good risc management etc.  
This TMA is repainting, but it can be useful. You should not change the color to none of this indicator, because I understood it as over this level trends occur.  
Yes, many of my indicators come from former forex-tsd board, now it's  
[https://www.forex-station.com/viewto...3458&hilit=tma](https://www.forex-station.com/viewtopic.php?f=578480&t=8423458&hilit=tma)  
Mladens indicators like the TMA do not repaint. You can ask him to change TMAslope to non-repainting.  
I see you try out the atr-bands :-) and also wider ones. Great, because tmaslope or other indicators more often says new trend, when bands say, be caucious, prices are at a resistance.  
You shall watch it in backtester (Mt4 Ctrl R)

hello, friend 4 you,  
  
i do not use it for bar to bar analysis, i use it after its centerline crossover and also not alone , i use it with nonrepainting mladen indicator as is seen in image so it does not hurt much of recalculations.  
  
i use it only at critical junctures only for finding where price retracements ends. like near golden line for assessing pullback of prices in current trending market and at lower border of clouds to find retracements only.

I think the averages bands, not the keltner bands, with settings on heikin ashi weighted price bars with adaptive set on, fits best many markets, but I still wait for the scrolling back(testing) findings of our readers as their best settings for faster and slower bands. But on longer trends or on 1 min, I think the normal atr-bands with mode 3 (linear weighted sma) and price 4 (weighted) fits best as it's slower.  
  
Filtering sideways is not easy, but when price is near longer bands, most times, the chances for a breakout above are smaller.  
Because trends can be faster, it is a good choice to have different bands to tighten sl on good moves. Trading is about distance of sl (at bands in trends) and tp (on strong outbreaks that flatten), it's about crv, not if you got 100 or 50 pips.  
watch my older pics from  
[https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...9#post10297749](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=10297749#post10297749)  
  
Please try the attached indicator as your oscillator. Spikes out of the shown bands or extreme prices show that the price may change direction, BEFORE it occurs. Oscillators are ranging between extremes therefore it is normal, that they show false shorts on longer trends. You should not short, if lower atr-bands or averages bands are not broken. This is a non repainting indicator (like nearly all from coder mladen, one chief of forex-station.com), which is not often published. I just changed these values, which can be changed in indicator options also:  
mladens standard settings (also written in the mq4-file):  
//extern ENUM_TIMEFRAMES TimeFrame = PERIOD_CURRENT;  
//extern int RsxPeriod = 3;  
//extern enPrices RsxPrice = pr_haclose;  
//extern int SignalPeriod = 2;  
//extern ENUM_MA_METHOD SignalMethod = MODE_SMA;  
//extern int TmaHalfLength = 6;

You should read more than first and last page here. I posted all few days ago, but maybe Brijeshsinh can update post 1 and write to save indicators in indicators/Downloads folder.

hello, friend4you,  
  
your tighter atr band settings with center line with step one more average 2.3 mtf without upper and lower bands, are generating crossover signals that are workable in ranging markets and helping ride trend filtering all whipsaws.  
  
tried many indicators before that are smoother to filter whipsaws and still faster to give faster exit and entry .  
  
your settings of bands on atr has done the right thing for that.  
  
never thaught of atr before that it will be useful like that.  
  
being atr, centerline of atr bands will always be near median price of any price candle so it will automatically filter whipsaws on price bars, still being fast reactive when price turns during reversal because of its advantage of being near median price of each candles.  
advantage of atr centerline has always been of being smoother and faster reactive to prices, no moving average can match that.; as atr bands always is result of atr range of price moves. moving average does not take this in calculations, the price ranges.  
that is why atr bands are more adaptive to price action and faster reactive.  
  
now you see how reliable signals your setting of tighter band centerline is generating with step one more average 2.3 mt , how useful it is with step one more average 2.3 mtf indicator.  
  
use step one more average 2.3 mtf indicator as you are using with oma 25(mladens default settings with indicators)  
load step one more average 2.3 mtf histogram indicator and ha..keye heatmap indicator for comparision with sniper rishijay trading system  
  
now overlap atr bands with your settings for tighter bands. keep only centerline. remove upper bands and lower bands color and observe.  
  
great filtering of all price whipsaws, keeping in trend till trend lasts, gives excellent entry exit(cross of center line with step one more average 2.3 mtf indicator on chart)  
  
because being atr band cente line, now ranges can be filtered .  
(ranges are result of collection of all average ranges of all bars forming its range) .  
  
atr bands also helps in showing price pressures that is where the future direction of prices will be. so atr center line is useful to show price pressures as you very well know.  
  
see image. will upload more when you test as above.

thin yellow line in image is center line of your setting of tighter atr bands without upper band and lower bands. rest indicators you know very well.

To what band indicator, I posted, are you refering?  
What you write, is not true. Wihout bands, you just see an MA, on atr-bands.ex4 as I posted, its linear weighted lwma 11. The others can adopt better to changing markets as you can choose nearly 30 different ma.  
The important atr calculation just works with visible bands.  
How do you set good sl, that keep you also on 1 min charts long time in trends? The step oma (green-yellow in your pictures) is not always best choice.

yes you are right, sl and tp matters , as golden line has to be assessed, cloud averages too needs smoothing,  
  
not always the best choice though. need eye assesment of prices,  
  
everyone is waiting for your indicators to be posted.  
  
well that time will also come when friend4you also will put his indicators here on this thread and will give further explanation of his indicators and his technique of trading.  
  
for time being lets wait

I'm not sure, which template is your actual now. Please add it at post 1 with date, because no one knows to make indicators/Downloads directory in the first pages.

Don't use newer averages indicators, because they just have bands with constant pip bands, no volatility is calculated as in ATR (Average True Range). ATR value should also not be too high as white bands in your pic:

i will advise those who are new on this thread and want to test this system , to first download rar file that is on the first page.  
  
this file contains basic templet also.  
  
so once you understand basic templet then go for adding other indicators on it.  
  
because if you do not understand technicals of the system it will appear to you only as colorful system.  
  
once you understand the system this colors are the best trend identifier.

hello, friend4you,  
  
now we need to find indicator with that centerline that is useful, as per our talk, to change color also, for uptrend one color and for downtrend other color just like fxsnipers ma.  
  
that will further enhance early exit and early entry before crossover signal is generated.

Tip for your homework on finding good settings as we all want to benefit from everybodys opinion here (read my older posts on bands and rsx):  
Here's a pic of rsx-indicator, a trendy rsi-indicator with bands, that may be part of the system.  
Try different ma also on averages atr bands (brown bands) as it tells most of the time right direction, even with such difficult situations, that many threads never show:

These sideway indicators delete many trades. Bands help in the best possible way. Maybe we should work on finding indicators that marks situations when it is more likely that a good move will begin. Only beginners look only on indicators which represent up and downs.  
  
I said 0 cross on cci 10 may be an option. Otherwise your system as in picture above only shows on macd tape 0 cross some good signals, but late. The angels of both outer bands is an option I would choose.

yes it is difficult to find when significant move will start.  
because many times indicators align but price move is not strong to make good profit.  
  
can not find any indicator yet but stlm histogram inclusion in sniper rishijay system was one reason to find this.  
  
if you observe there remains different angles on price slope on stlm histogram in different kind of price moves. i use that angle and i have found it better then any angle showing indicator.  
  
when there is sharp move of prices histogram bars moves faster to post bigger bars and creates more verticle angle and when there is slow price moves it creates very low angle. this second type of low angle are opportunities as this low angle can get taken away by single big price bar(changing angle on stlm next bar)  
  
so if in trend there is counter trend retracement, and if i want to take entry again in the direction of trend, then i check the angle on stlm histogram, if it is low angle that means this angle can be taken away easily with one sharp bar in the direction of trend.  
  
if angle is very steep on counter trend retracement then it shows that prices have strength as to create steep angle and reversal can also occur so i wait a bit more for confirmation.

wider band angle is slow.  
  
use tighter band to find angle. set ma-period=5 to create much tighter bands, that are much tighter then your settings , that will give idea of angle of prices.  
  
use it with instructions in links txt. above

i have found angle of centerline of your settings of tighter band with angle of stlm histogram useful together.  
  
you can also add angle of cloud(BLUE CLOUD- faster cloud) with it. you can create similar faster cloud for down price trend also if you want to add angle of cloud as guide with above two indicators

use tma centerline to assess angle of prices.  
  
do not pay attention to bright blue and red colors on tma.  
  
it is center line cross on tma- this are the points when major price actions starts.  
  
tma center line cross displays angle of prices well.  
  
markets are always fast, indicators will give signals late. there is no match of tma in finding angles on prices and its centerline crosses for price action assesment.  
  
if you have any other tma( non recalculating) then do post here, i will test it out. as tma is far useful and faster to generate signal then other indicators.

use tma for assesment only , i.e to assess that your presumed direction of trend is going to be right or wrong.  
it gives idea where the cycle ends and next cycle begins.  
do not use it for trading indicator.

hello, friend4you,  
  
i think it is worth putting an idea forward to any coder to get histogram created of centerline of your settings of tighter band, histogram just like color changing and slope histogram of stlm indicator.  
  
as centerline of your settings of tighter band is free of whipsaw, histogram will also be free of whipsaw.  
as prices above centerline is uptrend and prices below it is downtrend broadly.  
  
this histogram will also help identify when good price move will start.

Please reread my posts attached. Use any ma histogram for your purpose. Tighter band is for small sl on trends, wider to find the best place to enter on retracements based on volatility as it always changes. If wider bands break, you often have a new trend.  
For daytraders as me, it is very important to trade, when strength comes, because small sl set at the bands, shall survive. On the long run, I have to filter sideways and cannot long when market is not trending the NEXT bars.  
If you don't like cci, you can use rsi for this. I found famous, expensive systems: They just don't trade, when price on rsi 10 is between 45 and 55.  
STLM shows small bars just in reference to all bars on chart. After strong moves, pullbacks appear small, but if you scroll on, the same bar shows bigger bars. To prevent this, you have to set maximum and minimum in options of that indi (like -100 and 100) and then all your advantages disappear. Therefore, that indi does not help much.  
Most of your indicators are ma-based, that means, that your settings present the volatile pair. Try your system on eurchf 5 min on some sideway days and you see many false signals. My bands (not the ma in the middle) will adapt quickly like horizontal support lines, which are also very important and cci and rsi will still show strength in relative to the waves in the nearer past.  
I talked to a frequent user of 1rsx indicator and my observation were correct:  
[https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...3#post10313243](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=10313243#post10313243)  
Please try the attached indicator as your oscillator. Spikes out of the shown bands or extreme prices show that the price may change direction, BEFORE it occurs. Oscillators are ranging between extremes therefore it is normal, that they show false shorts on longer trends. You should not short, if lower atr-bands or averages bands are not broken. This is a non repainting indicator (like nearly all from coder mladen, one chief of forex-station.com), which is not often published.  
Thanks, your information and experience with your indicators are very helpful.

The others can adopt better to changing markets as you can choose nearly 30 different ma. The important atr calculation just works with visible bands. How do you set good sl, that keep you also on 1 min charts long time in trends? The step oma (green-yellow in your pictures) is not always best choice.

hello, friend4you,  
  
i have removed fx snipers ma forming lower border of cloud permanently , thanks to your settings of atr bands, that centerline is doing all the good job of filtering without whipsaw. that centerline has proved to be very useful.  
  
in above images you will not find that lower border ema.  
  
after much testing i have found much reliable and accurate results with that centerline of yours.  
  
thank you for your idea.

You mean the thin, yellow line is atr-bands and you made the best part invisible? It should be the same as fx sniper as both are normal ma without any adaptiveness. Did you try averages atr-bands with hull settings?  
Maybe you post a template you use every day.

for the readers ,  
  
do not get confused, this is just the random sample.  
and random indicators.  
  
everyone who are using and testing sniper rishijay trading system already knows the templet of it.  
  
if any one have found something with this system they can share their view, indicators or their own systems so that sniper rishijay trading system can be improved.  
  
the new cloud like indicator that all of you are seeing is the indicator just posted above images.  
  
note-- if you find this cloud indicator not working. then load that indicator on chart. keep that chart open . close mt4 terminal. then restart mt4 again. that indicator will appear on chart..  
  
i think there is bug in that indicator !!

hello, friend4you,  
  
now that two line are forming a kind of ribbon. that proving to be absolute make of break level for short term trend reversal.  
  
that ribbon can also be made color filled. for uptrend one color and for downtrend another color. that idea is also worth proposing to coder, just for better visualisation.  
  
  
i am also trying different settings with your bands, so that such a ribbon can be made for replacement of golden line. as this will be far more adaptive to price moves( as it calculates median prices of ranges) then golden line ( based on ma so not so adaptive as atr)  
  
if i find such settings then golden line can also be replaced.  
  
if you have any suggestions for settings for that, do suggest. as you are using bands for long time, you are far more accustomed with its settings then me.

These averages atr-bands have adaptiveness in options as I asked mladen for this 2016 and hull is reacting much better on big candles or gaps as your sma. SMA or EMA do not change, if you use it with bands (atr-bands indicator) or without (your fx sniper ma).

Does your system always show perfect pullback entry points with minimal sl and in the oscillator 1rsx good exit points, when thick green brown lines are over white band. I posted the indicators already. Thanks to wulong and mladen from forex-station for 1rsx idea.

rsx indicator is more useful for exit signal when you have taken position in the direction of trend , it shows when the prices are overstretched.  
  
bands are useful for deciding sl levels. and when prices moves out of bands then it helps in assessing that again prices may pull back in the bands. before prices again pull backs inside bands , rsx helps in early exit.

uploaded this indicator so that you can compare what tma slope actually does.  
  
  
load angle of t3 with t3=20, rest settings as it is., with tma slope.  
  
as you may not be comfortable using tma slope , this is the filter for tma you can add.  
  
for both of indicators it is centerline that is important, from where major price action will begin.  
  
colors on indicators will appear late.

I use the settings of 1rsxb02 I implement in the mq4 file as said.  
Thanks for the indicators, but maybe you should also post your best template as people get confused and want to talk about ONE system.  
Angel of T3 is good, but it filters many pullbacks, where entry would be best. Maybe with slower settings.  
The indis here are newer and better than on other threads. Sideway filtering is an advanced topic, which mainly isn't a topic there.  
  
I think, if prices are over the middle line tells me, the up strength is good and I tp at top of the bands, if middle bands don't go up. Many good strategies work this way, that you just trade if price is over 2 emas for example.  
Maybe an advanced rsi is also a good idea, but it should be used as help, not as a rule, so that you don't enter at top or only few times.

yes friend4you, if tma slope( or angle of t3) is above midline it suggests that up strength is good, but only if sniper rishijay system is generating buy signal.  
  
say if sniper rishijay system is on sell signal and tma is trying to cross above midline it is either sideways market of trend reversal is immitent.

that is how tma slope(angle of t3) are useful to identify sideways market and to detect when trend is going to reverse, when is used in contaxt with sniper rishijay system and not alone.

Thanks for the support of the readers. If you use cross with 0 line, set treshold to 0. But that does not filter sideways. Indi just makes sense with higher treshold (grey bars) as in picture.  
Oma with adaptive off may be better as it is slower. But maybe you find better settings. Ger30 (German Dax) on Sept 13th shows typical sideway day. Did you find better settings?

hello, friend4you,  
  
at t3 settings=20 it matches perfectly with all indicators , including line crossing of centerline and step oma.(see rectangles-yello)  
  
at default setting so mladen=34 it gives a bit late exit.(see red arrows) this default settings matches with golden line break of prices  
  
see image attached

the more the t3 value on that indicator , more longer cycles it shows and much smoother the histogram will be but at the cost of late entry and exit, so longer cycles not much useful.  
  
the lesser the t3 valus, more shorter cycles it shows with more whipsaws, not helpful either too.

I see only disadvantages, when all indicators are ma-based and show similar things. In the middle of the picture you see, that systems changes color on small pullbacks which will lead to losses.  
It's better to use longer periods like mladen on many indicators to enter in main trend instead of against it.

till your tighter atr bands centerline and step oma of mladen indicator line do not show crossover signals that retracements as you mentioned are again good re entry points in the direction of the trend.  
  
your centerline and step oma line are doing all heavy lifting to filter this whipsaws that is the real advantage of centerline of your atr bands as it filters everything.

default settings of mladen on angle of t3 are more useful when prices are at golden line , and you want to assess that whether prices will break golden line or not

Hi Brijeshsinh, previous sniper rishijay system includes hawk eye heat map and super trend indicator. As per the update you mentioned, are those 2 indicators are no longer in use?

Thanks for your reply, tested your new version and i would say it's better than the previous one as it filtered false trend and signals.  
  
For example, in the previous system even when sell signals is triggered i.e mj trend is red, supertrend is red, bar candle is red, stoch is in sell position still it could be a bad trade. I've back tested your system with one bad trade that i've made previously with the old system and it does filter it out.  
  
I've added AUTO TL to it to further strengthen my justification and having 30 pips for both SL and TP i.e 1:1. I'm using it on M30 chart with almost all major pairs, hit a TP on NZD/USD this morning thanks to your new system.   
  
GREAT JOB BRIJESHSINH

I would say that the system you had in the first post is solid enough and i would suggest we discuss on the trade system itself i.e taking the trade while its trending or better SL and TP points perhaps. No point of adding more indicator towards it as it will confuse the original setups

hello, Qime,  
yes, regarding how to decide sl and tp it differs among different traders.  
  
friend4you uses his atr bands useful.  
he puts band borders as stoploss and opposite wider band as his tp, as he has found that when prices are at wider bands chances of prices breaking that band is low so that way sl of his survies.  
  
friend4you may through more light on that as he is best person using atr bands for long  
  
i find support and resistance levels drawn with my system indicator useful with atr bands  
  
your experience and views are also welcomed

Thank you. Look at my older pictures. It is not always as easy, but if wider band breaks, a bigger move is possible. If trend goes sideway, you can put your last part on a wider sl at the bigger bands. They are also like resistance lines. For most pairs, it works very good. Only if an instrument is sideway ALL the time, every MA needs changes.  
Filtering is not easy, always watch higher timeframes. Why don't you like oscillators? As many of your indicators are measuring MA, they all tell the same even on ranges. Lindercourt is a popular system using rsi 10, others used 17 as sideway filter, but that fails on bigger ranges.  
Why don't you post pictures of the system you use now and tell us also the negative side to eliminate problems?

Hi, only use the one in the very first post and template from the 2nd page called 2.tpl and the rest of the indicators personally i'd say unnecessary

hello, friend4you,  
  
target bands posted on post-577 looks very useful with your tighter atr bands for identifying tp and sl levels. that is quite accurate too.  
  
you may want to check that out with your tighter bands.

Centered Bands as your "target bands" repaint. rsima as a faster TDI /Malones Traders Dynamic Index) is a good addition (RSX on bands).  
Long in direction of slow middle line, especially when red blue lines are broken. Yours has unusual settings and lines with no color. Try the attached.  
I see no indi that shows the strength of the pair or any overbought area. But I like the trendbased RSI, the RSX as in TDI smoothed.

Hi brijeshsinh, I love this thread and the strategy. but my only problem after studying the indicators is that; I'm lost as to exactly indicator to use. please kindly do me a favor and some traders, attach all the indicators you used in the posts 60-74 for your trade examples and let's try that and later we can moderate it if necessary.  
thanks

Brijesh,  
i think you need to consolidate all indicators and template and provide once again   
  
so that it is clear   
  
sometimes with so many indicators being posted frequently there is confusion.  
  
when we talk all must be on same page

Hi, I still wait for your detailed answer. Do you think, oscillators and indicators that don't show the same nearly ALWAYS are better like in most other trading systems?  
Why don't you like oscillators?

> Thank you. Look at my older pictures. It is not always as easy, but if wider band breaks, a bigger move is possible. If trend goes sideway, you can put your last part on a wider sl at the bigger bands. They are also like resistance lines. For most pairs, it works very good. Only if an instrument is sideway ALL the time, every MA needs changes. Filtering is not easy, always watch higher timeframes. Why don't you like oscillators? As many of your indicators are measuring MA, they all tell the same even on ranges. Lindercourt is a popular system using...

oscillators are useful in nontrending markest,  
sniper rishijay system is aimed at catching trends and so you can set your tp levels as per your choice.  
every trader have their own tp and sl mechanisms set for their style.oscillators gives early exit in trending market.  
so check this out.find your answer -tp === l. in rar file  
hope this tp level will help you out solve problem.  
see the image attached.  
some indicators are for assesment. some for filtering sideways market.  
some for deciding tp and sl levels- target bands.  
some for early exit. eft macd.  
they all need not align always to take entry and exit.  
some to keep in trend- step oma with centerline atr  
like that indicators have different purpose

Thanks. Make folder Downloads in indicators, so that tlp in rar works. Oscilators are also useful for trending markets, but I meant indicators for filtering best entry and sl points. Where do you change sl?  
Your indicators show the past and I'm missing the atr band indicators I posted and that you liked so much. Bollinger Bands break out in both directions and are for sl useless then.  
Target bands and Tmaslope are repainting and stlm should be fixed on max. and min. values on options like 40 and -40, so that its bar height isn't changing according to chart volatility, which is temporarely on screen.  
TmaSlope and as tp Target Bands are centered tma and repainting, no ea can use it.

I made the heijden MAC3D alert on each timeframe change or start invisible, nothing else. Indicators of older rar files are necessary for template.  
Which ETF indicator is in the subwindow?  
Trend direction can be using against sideways, but good settings are difficult to find.

i have not activated upper and lower borders of atr bands , so that image does not look clumsy. you can activate it and check that in following ways.  
  
i use your atr band , bb bands and target bands together differently.  
  
for example in uptrend prices starts correcting and hits golden line, at that point previously big question was that whether prices will break it or will start moving again up in the direction of uptrend again.  
  
in this condition this three bands combine helps.  
  
when prices hits golden line at that point i see what this bands are doing. if prices are also hitting lower border of target bands, and your atr bands lower border too is hitting the lower border of target bands the first condition is met.  
  
for second condition to be met, role of bb bands comes. if at this point bb bands are narrow, tighter ranges of prices then it is likely that prices will again start moving up in the direction of uptrend. and golden line will not be broken. so that low of price automatically become sl and that usually holds well.  
  
but at this point bb bands are wider, wider price range , then it is more likely that golden line will be broken.  
  
so that has helped to decide what will be price action at golden line.  
  
so that is how this is useful.  
  
what i have observed that price action respects the borders of target bands most of the time.  
  
you may also want to check this out.

when prices are at target bands and sniper rishijay trading system generates signals, then at that point risk reward is more favourable.  
  
when prices are in the middle of target bands and sniper rishijay trading system generates signals , then risk reward is less favourable.

hello, arlucad,  
  
nice to hear from you again,  
  
your suggestions for sniper rishijay trading system are now more important for me, as you being experienced technical analyst and experienced trader, who have tested sniper rishijay trading system thoroughly have more precise idea of how sniper rishijay system works.  
  
you can test now new advanced templet that i have posted in previous posts, that has more advanced indicators.  
  
you will now be able to assess market conditions more easily with this templet.  
  
hoping to hear from you regularly.  
  
thank you.

still working through all the indicators and try to understand how they work ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
  
But imo the system can work great with multitimeframe sorry when there is an indicator for that I havent seen it until now.  
  
But when using h4 h1 foe trend and m15 for entry we can catch some nice trades and the range problem would be smaller.  
  
I like the concept of a daily or weekly target. Like 20 pips a day. It help not to over trade. 

Everyday better.

yes, arlucad you are absolutely right,  
  
trading on higher timeframe gives better results with sniper rishijay trading system and ranging markets can be easily avoided with this system on higher time frames trading

it is always better to trade on higher timeframe  
  
besides it helping in not to overtrade as you mentioned.  
  
also you get some space even though you get marginal error of judgement. on higher timeframe trading gives you opportunities to still make profit.

Thanks i will test it!  
  
  
A question would be if you can combine some indicators  
I would put two in one Window to get a bigger price chart ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f600.png?v=15.1)_or only indis and another window with chart only_

By adding forex freedom bars to it i found that it eliminates sideways market during the best setup which is when the candle first break the golden line, the only question now is how to make entry when is ongoing like yesterday when most major pair are in a strong trend

hello, Qime,  
  
adding forex freedom bars to assess price action at golden line is nice idea.  
  
another point to see at golden line is, when golden line is broken , usually it is broken with force, i.e. prices moves past it rapidly.  
  
if prices are moving slowly near golden line , then it is less likely that golden line will be broken.  
  
in strong trending market it is sometimes difficult to make entry, as you do not want to chase prices higher always., it is better to wait for consolidation to enter. but very strong trend sometimes do not give that pause.  
  
i think yesterday's strength in dollar is here to stay. as after long time dollar index is on buy signal on sniper rishijay system.  
  
strong dollar is putting pressure on gold and bonds. that is the reason S&P 500 US index is hitting new highs.

Hi Brijesh,  
I request you to upload templet and indicator one more time which was used in post 624. I will work on it this weekend and add 2-3 new indicator and repost it here.  
Thank you in advance. If it needed dll file then please add it too.

Hi Brijeshnish,  
  
I've made about 11 test on the system and made 3 bad trades out of it. Still a very good ratio, just wondering whether i could make it better. Please find attached one of the bad trades i made and bear in mind that the mtf freedom bars only been added after the trade. MTF Freedom Bars would be great additional to the system but sometimes the confirmation is bit late, need an advise from you what could possibly go wrong should the trade been taken without the Freedom Bars

hello, Qime,  
  
nice to see you testing system ,  
  
to filter bad trades at golden line, i have recently updated and refined templet of sniper rishijay system.  
  
see the attached image for further explanation.  
  
image shows the exact trade that you have but with newer refined templet to filter trades at golden line.  
  
point to note on my image is the addition of two bands-- wider orange bands are target bands. and tighter white bands are atr bands of friend4you.  
  
how to use it at golden line-- see at white circle- where prices break down golden line- your trade to sell. at that point prices hits target bands also and white bands lower border also hits lower border of target bands. so that indicates that there is no more space available for prices to fall.  
  
now see at yellow triangle-- price breaks golden line, but prices do not hit target bands and lower border of white bands(atr bands) also do not hit lower border of target bands. so there is room available for prices to fall and hit target bands, so that sell is ok.  
  
it is at orange rectangle that prices hits target bands and lower border of white atr bands also hits lower border of target bands . that is when sell target is reached.  
  
  
so that is refinement of newer templet. of sniper rishijay system.  
  
as you are now accustomed to older templet, this newer templet will help you take more easy decisions at golden line.  
  
try newer refined templet.  
  
all indicators needed for this new templet to work are already posted on this thread and  
  
this new refined templet is also posted in previous posts on this thread,  
  
  
  
keep posting images, your experiences so that more refinement can be done.  
  
  
  
i take this moment to thank few people like friend4you for providing atr bands and mladen for coding indicators that are included in sniper rishijay trading system.  
  
looking forward for regular communication from you,  
  
thank you.

adding forex freedom bar is good idea to filter trades at golden line.  
  
as you rightly said it is bit late for taking entry and exit. but i think as filter of golden line it should be ok as filter.

hello, astroartpdx,  
  
i will not be able to post the templet directly as it contains one very useful and accurate indicator that is so called commercial one.  
  
the owner of that indicator will interfere if i post that templet directly.  
  
the owner of that indicator has interfered also in my previous thread of old sniper rishijay trading system when i included that indicator in it, saying that it is under copyright act, and has got it removed from previous thread.  
  
you can easily make out which indicator i am talking about as you know old sniper rishijay system and new system also, as you were there also on previous thread.  
  
so i have posted that templet on this thread in different way. i assure you that i have posted it on this thread. check out all, links, hints, folders, indicators on this thread and you will surely find that templet.

hello, Qime,  
  
target bands borders are potential sl and tp levels,  
many traders use their own mechanisms for sl and tp levels.  
this bands provides with dynamic sl and tp levels.  
settings of atr bands is as provided by friend4you,  
you can check this out.  
use it with atr bands as shown in image.  
that will be better combination.  
settings of target bands is as per default. you can see previous posts and will get indicator settings, with indi. as it is on this thread.  
new refined templet is also on this thread, check message, links, in case, you miss it and want to check it out again.  
readers may want to read all the pages from beginning till now to find out indicators and recent refined templet that is more useful then the original one for filtering trades at golden line.  
see the image posted before--https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=692194&page=31  
  
this is the image of new templet, that everyone may check it out. with new indicators added on it.

hello, astroartpdx,  
you have many indicators right for new templet,  
  
i think this image shows that you have found out my refined new templet from this thread.  
  
read post 644 for band settings.  
these are the band settings.  
  
if you want direct settings in indicator, then you can request friend4you, to send you loaded settings in indicator with indicator to be sent to you directly. so that your image looks like that of mine.  
  
both Qime and you must have got message to follow, and how to get the right link to have missing indicators as you both have tested older version of sniper rishijay system and are now testing this newer version with refined templet also !  
  
astroartpdx, you can help Qime, as now you have got new refined new templet. you can help him finding this refined templet if he asks for help from you.  
  
i think he has got atr bands and target bands with him, so you can get that from Qime or from friend4you.  
  
if any reader on this thread want to help them then they can post atr bands of friend4you .  
  
i need premission of friend4you to post his atr bands as he has provided it.  
  
may be better thing will be that he himself replies to this query of astroartpdx and Qime.  
  
still let me say friend4you has posted this bands on this thread,  
  
so astroartpdx and Qime, if you both search from page 1 to till this page , you will find both art bands and target bands by yourself only.

here is new simple system could be profitable. please put heijden_mac3d in the download folder and other indicators in indicators folder.  
simple rules of the system.  
buy when teal blue dot appears on chart buy with sl of either golden line or red candle. let candle close for safer side  
sell when magenta dot appears on chart sell with sl of either golden line or blue candle.  
with this system, sl could hit but compared to profit on another side its not big sl  
be careful near red band and see if that is crossing if not then book part profit and keel golden line as sl.  
if red band cross then you can hold position till price candle close above or below red band.  
near white band price might get close to top out or bottom out so take full profit is advisable.  
  
Brijesh, friend4you please add any new points if you find in the system.

hello, astroartpdx  
  
nice to see you uploading your own new simple trading system.  
now readers have another system to test out.  
  
i think atr bands that you have posted are different then that of friend4you's atr bands.  
  
so now there is new atr bands on this thread of astroartpdx.  
  
so mystery of atr bands is now deepening.  
  
it is evident now that only friend4you can solve this mystery as he is frequent user of atr bands.  
i think astorartpdx , you can put personal sms request on this templet and atr bands , so that he can edit this templet to his style of trading and his indicators.  
  
readers on sidlines do you think it is the right time to jump in to give your opinion on this issue?  
  
or readers still are waiting for better entry to appear ! may be with better tp and sl !!!

Yes Brijesh this atr band is little different but as you see it give trend definition along with heijden system which is important in sniper rihijay system. I tried to keep it simple but you can add up blue and magenta wave with it too.

load from newer refined sniper rishijay templet then orange bands will appear as it contains compiled file of target bands.  
  
if you want to attach target bands manually as is seen in image then you need to follow steps of bug fix of 1090 version of metatrader then target bands will function completely .you are missing atr bands also, follow instructions as per message to find settings of it also.

while most of the readers are still grapling with , to understand basic templet of sniper rishijay system and how it functions.  
  
Qime you have done decent work to add indicators and understand the sniper rishijay trading system.  
  
re post image if needed after you got the indicators and settings. i will help add more indicators that are missing to complete newer templet.

yes it looks like target bands,  
it is useful with atr bands for deciding potential sl and tp levels.

You can add 10 more indicators that signal as same place, but do you think all other system sellers are stupid by using oscillators for non-trending periods and as warning that a tp is advised in an overbougt/oversold area? I already told that without proper reaction.  
The colorful heijden can be replaced by the respected ema 50 and basically many other of the 1000 indicators here by the "step ma one more average" set at 50 (rest on default) as you used it in the past.

your atr bands with target bands combination have helped identify overbought and oversold levels on dynamic bases.  
tma slope(angle of t3) i use as oscillator also in nontrending market. but as i do not trade sideways markets, so i do not need oscillators. when i find sideways markets i sit on sidelines and wait. as money is lost more in sideways markets .  
your atr bands with target bands have helped in identifying tp and sl levels more easily.  
  
your atr bands have now become core ingredient in my new refined templet of sniper rishijay trading system.  
see the image below how it is helpful( white circles) , when prices reverses, identification is easy.  
  
your atr bands settings are now haunting many readers on this thread, as they are not able to set settings as is needed.  
but i think if new refined templet is to be used by traders , then they need that settings and atr bands.  
otherwise it is not going to make difference either.  
many smart technical analysts and experienced traders like Qime have shown good interest in your atr bands and have done nice work to find out new templet and indicators .

Ok, that picture looks different than older ones with no bands. I see you take seriously, what I write in other boards, too. I thought of the difficulty of slow up-markets or changes from sideways to trend, which is often recognized as trend very late. 70 % of the time we have no trend. Yes, target bands are good to see that too and as they are set slow with higher values, repainting does not matter much.

yes, you are right repainting issue hurts much on faster indicators, bands are anyway slow, so repainting do not hurt much.  
  
yes we need to find indicator that recognises start of trend early, as only 30% time it is trending.  
and most of indicators gives signals late after start of trend.  
this is one of the reason i have stopped trading on lower time frames as , when you find strength of price moves coming and you enter, the faster prices actions on lower time frame gives very little time before it starts reversing , for exit.  
higher time frame trading gives time to enter and exit, and allows putting wider stoplosses, as tighter stoplosses hits frequently before price action resumes as per your assesment.  
price moves are always faster and that is not in our control. but by trading on higher timeframes i want time in my control for entry and exit.  
  
but for someone like you as intraday trader it is of utmost importance to react quickly , otherwise trend gets over when you enter and prices starts reversing.

i also feel need to add indicator to filter bad trades at golden line. that helps assessing whether prices will break golden line or not.  
  
your atr bands with target bands gives decent idea about how much room is left before prices hits target bands and starts reversing.  
  
but we need indicator to cement that assessment.  
  
any suggestions?

addition of target bands with your atr bands helps to enter early before actually trend gets established.

as i have not yet found that kind of indicator which gives very faster nonrepainting entry before trends starts.  
  
i use other criteria to stamp start of trend early and for early entry.  
margin money in futures segment that is allowed by any exchange or broker plays important role.  
  
if first move is of 2% on any timeframe and on any instruments then it roughly takes out 40%-50% of margin money on any contract. and that is enough to set panic among trades to start unwinding their positions.  
that creates the right move on prices. and gives early indication of start of trend.  
  
trend ends when all margin money allowed by exchange or broker is taken out and prices go beyond that limit, prices stays there so that every trader is squeezed out. and then prices starts to reverse when no more trader is left out.  
  
how is your experience of it?

Hi Brijesh,  
  
Run some test with TMA Slope and i think i found a very important rules of the system after all conditions has been met which the TMA Slope should be in solid red or solid green for both sell and buy entry. Look at the white circle where we discuss about the space between target bands and candle price break...on the first fail scenario we could see that the TMA Slope is not in condition for entry i.e not solid red whereas on the second condition where it's good for entry the TMA Slope turns to solid red on candle price breaks. I found on your previous pic that your TMA Slope is not as same setting as mine. Here are the settings of my TMA Slope

10.2 tma slope v.1.4.B 4.30 is smoother version of tma slope.  
this version is more useful for filtering bad trades. and as it is smoothened, recalculation is also slowed down. so it is better for filtering at golden line.  
  
i have only included the faster one in sniper rishijay system so as to avoid confusion.  
  
now since you have found out this smoother one also, it you combine this smoother version with faster one then you can filter whipsaws well still able to get faster entry and exit.  
  
tma is faster then other indicators the thing is that you need to get used to it with rest of indicators of system. it takes time to get used to it.  
those who do not prefer it have option to use angle of t3 indicator with t3 settings=20 to match exactley with faster tma slope indicator.

Hi Brijesh,  
  
Have a look at this t3 indicator to filtered out trades near the golden line. let me know what you think of it. In the chart there are many price points near golden line but very few t3 color changes.

hello, astroartpdx,  
  
your settings for t3 looks good. at golden line.  
  
as with your setings it doesn not change color frequently , so it can be reliable at golden line.

hello, Qime,  
  
do not use any tma slope in isolation because of recalculating nature of tma.  
  
i personally use is with stlm histogram slope.(non repainting)   
when stlm histogram is sloping in one direction and tma slope is confirming it then i get chance for early entry .  
  
you can put stlm histogram ,with both slow and fast tma slopes in consequetive subsindows and see how it is useful.

Many T3 repaint. This one has the added option of non-repainting tma and is similar to your 10.2 tma, but enable levels on both. You can define smaller zones, over them a trend is strong. I think breakouts over atr-bands or supports are the better option:

hello, friend4you,  
i used 1rsxbo2 indicator of you for exit in live markets, it gives exit much faster then other indicators. and more importantly that exit remains the right exit which is confirmed by sniper rishijay system indicators a bit later.  
  
any other such useful indicators that you use, then do post it.,

That is really helping, that no repaint indicator is a good friend of older times, with ONLY 2 extra filters it made a popular system for over a decade, but some versions repainted, not ours, but it is very fast alone. One second better free filter than the ma candle in that picture is attached (I have no mq4 of it). The other grey reminds me of something, you too?

1rsxbo is good, but the tma bands on it repaint, but you can drop a bollinger band on it, then you have a version of TDI, Traders Dynamic Index.

Does anyone notice that golden line is nothing but simple moving average? if you don't want all the settings and just golden line then just put the number what you put for mac3d ave4 to simple moving average.

! X2 ADX HISTO indicator can be used to support moves shown by tma slope indicator, as confirmation indicator in newer refined sniper rishijay system templet.

hello, friend4you,  
  
here is the image of refined new templet , that i have already posted on this thread,  
  
you know it , and you have that templet.  
yet testing new indicators with that,, so i thought why not post the same indicators that i am testing , on this thread so that readers can also test that indicators with new refined templet and someone can come up with new ideas.  
  
i test indicators with sniper rishijay system with my vision and experience.  
  
some one else sees the indicators with different vision and can bring up new ideas.  
  
for example , who does not know about atr bands,, i think everyone knows it.  
but how many traders uses it !  
  
i do not think many.  
  
so was not i, but when you gave idea of tighter bands settings, that changed whole atr bands,  
  
so that idea of settings was your vision and experience that i did not have.  
  
so that changed . and i added it now in new refined templet as core indicator.  
and you know it well how effective it is with step oma indicator, see in image also yellow line with red green color changing line crossing. generating nice signals. isn"t it?  
  
so ideas matters.  
  
indicators are the same all over the threads, but how to use it depends on some ones idea. in this todays ocen of indicators only few indicators are real pearls rest are just junks.  
  
lets see if some reader comes up with new ideas or not.

hello, Blueman,  
  
recently added one more indicator to sniper rishijay trading system.  
  
it gives good idea along with mj indicator to decide when market is sideways or trending.  
  
also it gives signals when market is oversold and overbought. gives yellow signals , so helpful for booking profit.  
  
see the white rectangle in left corner in images  
  
indicator is already posted in previous posts, you may want to try it along with newer refined sniper rishijay templet that is already posted earlier on this thread.  
  
see images attached

oversold yellow signal,  
  
it matches with oversold signals by target bands also, so caution and no more selling at current levels is the case.  
  
waiting for the bounce is more appropriate

oversold here too'  
  
gives early signals of oversold or overbaught before actually prices starts to reverse , and as usual other indicators are always late to give signals.

hello, clarmax,  
  
i think you are asking for orange colored channel bands,  
  
they are target bands that helps identify potential sl and tp levels on dynamic basis. see images.  
  
this indicator is also posted in previous posts , you can download that.  
  
or you can use newer refined sniper rishijay templet that includes target bands.  
  
this newer refined sniper rishijay trading system templet is hidden inside one of the rar files posted subsequently on this thread . you can go through previous posts rar files and can get it.

Hi Brijesh,  
  
I request you to create templet for post 968-970 also please post all the indicators with it and create the folder. That setup looks amazingly clear. Did you use 1-hour setup for it? I understand there is one copyrighted indicator into it which I already have so other then that I really like to set up the chart like those post.

hello, astroartpdx,  
  
which indicator are you missing in the image?  
  
one copyright indicator is what you have and all indicators are already posted on this thread  
  
you can upload your image so that is seen what is missing.

Hi Brijesh, I am missing few indicators. I know they are posted here but there are too many indicators to find out so I request you to post the updated templet and indicator which can help everyone. Thank you again for your hard work.

direct posting of indicator will not be easy as it involves copyright issues with indicator,  
  
but i will post the templet for you down the line in this thread when opportunity to hide this templet arises in off rush hours when there is minimum readers load on this thread to avoid it gaining attention by that copyright individual who can interfere with this thread.  
  
meanwhile you can keep your indicators in indicators=downloads subdirectory so that indicators works with that templet.

hello, astroartpdx,  
  
check out new refined templet as you have asked for .  
  
compare your image with this attached image.  
  
if your image do not match with this then you need to collect indicators that i have mentioned in last post.  
  
do not forget to post your image when you are done with this new templet so other readers can also benefit from it.

![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)) All indicators in the world of Forex should be here founded. Wouldn't it be easier to post all of them in one RAR. Sorry by asking this, I could not understand the purpose for this. I went about 15-20 pages back and in most cases I see one template chart. So all those indis are not in use with your main chart? I again sorry me, but I am lost in the thread to understand what I have to use to trade alike your main template.

hello, freedom48,  
  
here is the image of refined newer templet attached below,  
  
rar file on first page contains basic and professional templets that you can use.  
  
if you want to use refined newer templet that has been posted afterwards then your image will match exactly with this image of mine attached  
  
this refined templet is hidden in one of the rar file posted later on on this thread. and there is reason for it being hidden.  
  
i have posted this templet also on this thread on request of astroartpdx.  
  
all indicators needed for this templet are also on this thread  
with this templet your image will match with mine.  
check out rar files and you will find it.

clarmax,  
  
two additional indicators to better visualise the things. and more clearity of the direction of trend.  
  
\- better heatmap(lowest window)- see yellow lines to show where moving averages and trend changing with heatmap color change.  
  
\- see the boxes at right lower corner of images. == shows early before trend sets in. green box- bullish, red box - bearish, grey box- sideways, will show also percentage, direction as -breakout, trending , ranging (to filter sideways markets)

Would love to test your system , BUT they way that the indicators keep adding up every now and then , that will confuse any interested member.  
  
IT would have been a great way if you just took the time to update your first post with the latest tpl + indicators in one zip file .  
  
Thanks and best of luck

abusaad412,  
  
who do not trade loose more money seeing bars only without indicators. who do not use hama bars for what to see lines without colors.  
dear trader this thread is not about holy grail. and templets and indicators are zipped in already for readers. effort matters to find it out.

Many come here, read the first and last page and complain they cannot continue to collect systems as they like without doing much. There are many good indicators here and here is no tv-show, where you just consume. I already contributed and you should read from there, where also templates are for the bees here :-)

Hi Brijeshsinh  
  
Nice work and thanks for your time spent on helping others. Could you give the indicators contained in the above chart in one place together with the tpl?  
  
Wishing you a happy and successful 2018.

hello, akwaig  
  
templet is on that page only where you see the image mentioned. try to find it out as it is hidden.  
  
open templet in text editor-notepad and you will be able to see which indicators are used in that templet. all indicators needed are posted already on this thread.  
  
happy new year to you also.

it is posted in previous posts, you can go through previous posts where you will find all indicators and templets also,  
  
templets are hidden in rar files, so if you want templets then check out rar files posted in this thread, you will definately find all templets pertaining to images you see in this thread.

Uploading indicators without modifying templates is not good. Anytime you posted new indicators always include it templates.   
  
Also, quote the dll link.   
  
  
Thank you. 

It's not what you DO, it's HOW you do it.

Hi, I like many of the indicators you use. Maybe you post again the two templates you use every day, the fast and the most colorful.  
Users can open the file in editor, if they don't have all indicators in folder indicators/downloads. It's also better to read some pages for the many, who just want to collect systems for their holy grail. In fact, in other threads here, I mostly see just old indicators and always veriances of the same rsi-macd topic.  
Buzzers and the last posted are my favourites. Maybe you like to tell your trading rules for entry and exit, so that others can understand your trading more easily.

I think a fibo indicator is not enough for complete rules where to enter and exit.  
Why do you prefer kst? On long up-trends, it always shows short on sideways.  
You also use many indicators on standard settings. I don't think that all coders took the time to find the best settings on all timeframes. Mostly they use conservative settings that also work on M5.

hello, friend4you,  
fibo indicator just helps to through out target levels visually, its stop loss matches with stops of your atr band borders as you use it . so when system shows trend reversal this fibo indicators sl and sl of your atr bands borders usually survives.(that is most important in trading with your bands that small sl should survive and your position should be immediately in profit , if entry is right)  
  
it is still better to use it with attached indicator. donforex heatmap.- though this indicator looks like ordinary sr level indicator, if you match its data with real put and call option data and open interest data, it matches well with that real data(you need to match data with sotck and index futures data on real exchange data,, as forex pairs on mt4 may not be of use ), so helpful in showing where real put and call concentration(or vloume and open interest you can say) lies, which are the real support and resistance levels. you can see how prices behaves when zones on this indicator breaks and prices moves faster to the next zone, this gives me idea of how trend strength is going to be, to take a entry, to minimise false breakout entry.  
you know my system fully now, kst is for visibility on chart, set the setting on it to match with my system. for trend following there is always step oma 2.3 to see., and mtf mode also for trend following

this indicator is also good to assess trend strength, as this indicator uses real indicators like rsi, momentum, macd etc to arrive at trend strength it shows real trend strength .(unlike most of trend strength or heatmap indicators that uses daily ranges to show trend strength, so they are no good)  
  
it is possible to combine users time frames too, so for example if i want to trade on m5, if i combine m5+m15 on this indicator it immediately shows in percentage , the trend in this two combined timeframes on my m5 chart. so i need not to analyse all timeframes and all indicators always, it becomes easy analysing.  
i have my settings on this indicators to perfectly match with my system. the key is to keep only those indicators on this indicators that are needed, if you keep all indicators to true ,signals will be slow, and if you keep too less indicators to true it will give whipsaws. also if you need to combine timeframes then coef settings to be like 1,2,3,4,5,6..... on this column too. this indicator is also useful on my htf and ltf templets for immediate analysis of trend.

I prefer the nitro indicator with standard settings, which is newer and sold. I like to compare it, which settings on which ferruFX indicator do you use? Posting a of your most used colorful template is the fastest way to see what is better.  
  
Which open interest data do you use? Some of the futures are only published weekly and most volume of the daily 4 billion is traded outside the fx futures.

i did compare this indicator with nitro indicator, nitro is little slower then this indicator at times of turnaround from crucial ma reversal points, also this indicator allows for combining two timetrames or multiple timeframes together, ( when you combine timeframes it will assess all below indicators in all combined time frames and then will give signal)  
  
setting- fast ma- true, medium ma-true  
-cci -true, macd-true, adx-true, rsi-tru - rest indicators-false  
  
open interest of data on stocks futures and index futures . there is no real open interest data available for forex pairs for timeframes used and volume too is of broker volume only.

I am always curious about new systems and strategies. Therefore I visited this topic and I read the first 5 pages and than I skipped to the last page. Each time I see a huge amount of separate indicators which is not inviting to look further. It is really very confusing. I want to see a zip or arj file with all indicators and a template.   
  
In this zip file all indicators with the right parameters are automatically in including with the template and it would be easy if a printsceen is included of your monitor..  
  
Please, will you send again the _**best zip of arj file with all indicators, template and a print screen**_ of your monitor you are using now and which is the best in your opinion. And tell me your timeframe which is the best in your opinion.  
  
Thanks! 

Keep it simple without too many crappy indicators!

indicators gives insight to what is going to happen to prices with basic analysis intact. though you will find many people trying to trade without indicators,  
are you surprised then, had there be no importance why gerald apple, dean melone, mladen and many more are spending in there precious time to make indicators?!!!

There is no perfect holy grail indicator . you can try Indicators posted with my system. Many updates of system is there. All new updated templates are hidden in the far files posted subsequently. You can choose them according to your trading style.  
Posted other indicators here so that someone can benefit out of that.

Interesting indicators, many seem to behave like watching tv: make everything with pictures to become millionaire in 4 weeks. Watch the rar and zip files.  
  
Main system did not change much, many pics are posted. Also my critics stay the same, read all my posts, for example:  
[https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...8#post10355658](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=10355658#post10355658)  
  
What do you use to see which pair to trade, you posted ccfp, is that the best pair watcher?

nice to hear from you again after a while,  
  
visual screening is the best screening still i do manually on every chart, but to have a quick scanning,  
  
i use fxreactor to screen trending pairs, it is just ccfp but quickly screens all pairs and shows top trending pairs immediately.  
\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
then begins the manual search chart by chart and in all timeframes for better entry with my system.  
  
i have based my system to divide time and price zones equally( this are the two important dimensions for reading chart).  
\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
e.g. if you divide price by factor x then you should divide time zones too with the same factor x, so as to have synchronization with time and price zones equally to get the right entry point  
  
\-------------------------------------  
factor x- here in system is 4( multiplication and division by 4 on time zones and price zones)  
\------------------------------------  
for example-- lets first divide time zones equally to find which time frames to be used for chart analysis,  
  
TIME ZONE DIVISION--  
===============  
-best timeframes for analysis-  
  
-1)for instruments traded for 24 hours(factor of 4)-will be 15 minutes, 1 hour( 15 minutes X 4=60 minutes), 4 hour( 1 hour X 4= 4 hour).... like that, so 30 minutes is odd time frame to analyse , ( this will set time zone division for instruments for instruments traded for 24 hours like forex)  
  
-2) for instruments that are traded on only during exchange open hours( usually 6 hours approximately on all exchanges, 6hours X 4= 24 hours)  
  
(here also factor of 4) -here in this case 15 minutes time frame will equate to 1 hour time frame(60 minutes)(15 minutes x4) for instruments traded for 24 hours, and 1 hour time frame will equate to 4 hour time frame(1 hour x 4) for instruments traded for 24 hours duration, ..... so on  
  
\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
PRICE ZONE DIVISION-  
================  
  
Apply factor of 4 on moving average to get better entry points,  
  
basics of division- for crucial 13 , 50 ,200 ema(factor of 4 as with time zones to get synchronization with time zones)-13 ema x4=52 (50 ema), 50 emaX4= 200 ema  
  
  
so on above formula,  
  
1)for instruments traded for 24 hours- 50 ema on 1 hourly chart=13 ema on 4 hourly chart( factor of 4 for both price zones and time zones)  
\- 200 ema to 1 hourly chart= 50 ema on 4 hourly chart( again,factor of 4 for both price zones and timezones)  
  
....so 0n for other time frames also  
  
-2) for instruments that are traded on only during exchange open hours( usually 6 hours approximately on all exchanges, 6hours X 4= 24 hours)  
  
\- 50 ema on 15 minutes chart=13 ema on 1 hourly chart(60 minutes)( factor of 4 for both price zones and time zones)  
-200 ema on 15 minutes chart = 50 ema on 1 hourly chart( again,factor of 4 for both price zones and timezones)  
  
so on for other time frames also,  
  
  
so this is how system is based , it revolves around on equal time and price division,  
  
you will find now 5 minutes,15 minutes, 1 hourly and 4 hourly charts in sync with this system indicators, (30 minutes time frame will not be in sysn with the system as it does not fall into equal division of time and price zones)  
  
i evaluate manually like this to get better entry points, once fxreactor scans out top trending pairs, and shows it on screen,  
  
manual evaluation is time consuming but that is how i evalute a lot with all indicators and system before putting in my money on any trade, i find it better to evaluate a lot before getting in, rather then to get freezed afterwards when trade goes against my anticipation .  
\------------------  
if you have any other indicator that you u use for scanning forex pairs then do post it up.  
or any other useful indicator that you use do post it . will test it out.

i use USDINDEX as basic to do evaluation first of its chart to begin with.

Delp, really interesting system, are there newer versions or maybe you can post the system you trade now mainly? Do you use Fractals as sl? Has stochastic to come from extremes or do you enter long when over 50? i hope you know, that you cannot use Kijun-Stochastic crosses (as they change after scrolling) without setting the same min- maximum on Kijun which is not possible here. But the high value 500 makes it, that we can't see this effect.  
  
Only very good systems like yours work also on M1 and ignore much sideways. I removed the non-latin letters on one indicator, nothing more, so that also western mt4 users see that Kijun Envelope.  
  
How do you use Trendmanager on this system?

Interesting and always a pleasure to see your progress as I do since over a year, my friend. Thanks.  
step one more average 2.3 mtf:  
Maybe you play with higher sensitivity (Indi more horizontal then) to filter some sideways as I do as I siad earlier, with atr-bands, also, but unused in your package.  
  
It's better to have fewer, but better trades.

Which timeframe do you mainly trade?  
Template 2 and 3: How do you use qwma, don't you trade long, when some are near over the candles? Are all qwma like on monthly really a help?  
Where do you put sl tp1 and 2?

hello, friend4you,  
nice to hear from you,  
  
qwma has many distinct advantages,  
  
put qwma with your atr bands settings together and see, qwma line matches exactly with center line of your atr bands, that means that qwma is atr adjusted as we need it to be with price atr.(or your atr band or step oma) so it is very well coded.  
  
because of this its signals are in line with step oma,(try them loading together),  
  
so prices below qwma line suggests prices in lower atr zone(down move) and prices above qwma line suggests prices in upper atr zone(up move) as with step oma signals(or your atr bands) and as you use your atr style of trading, so everything is in sync with it.  
______________________________________________________________________________________---  
consider qwma line as step oma of that time frame(simply said 13 ema of that time frame, but with atr adjusted ),  
____---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
so qwma line of 1 minute time frame = 13 ema atr adjusted of that time frame(1 minute)(=step oma 2.3 mtfof 1 minute)  
  
qwma line of 5 minute time frame = 13 ema of 5 minute time frame(atr adjusted)= 50 ema of 1 minute time frame  
  
qwma line of 15 minute time frame= 13 ema(atr adjusted) of 15 minute time frame= 50 ema of 5 minute time frame= 200 ema of 1 minute time frame  
  
so on for all time frames.  
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  
  
you omit 30 minute time frame as it is out of sync, and above mentioned relation remains with all time frames,  
  
so when i need to see on single chart screen what is happening on all time frames i load qwma of all time frames i trade. and it shows everything ,  
  
e.g. -when 1 minute time frame qwma line breaks(13 ema), next target or support is 5 minute qwma line(50 ema of 1 minute frame = 13 ema(atr adjusted) of 5 minute frame) so on for all timeframes.  
  
the same applies to sl mechanism, this will match with sl of your atr bands , as you use as qwma is matching with your atr bands.  
so it is easy to see targets and sl on single screen  
  
other thing is each time frame qwma = macd for that time frame(or stlm histogram of that time frame)(price swings), so i can see what is happening to macd(stlm histogram) on all time frames(all time frame swings) in single chart.  
  
best trades are when qwma lines of two time frame are kissing each other,( e.g.- qwma lines of 1 minute and 5 minute are touching each other that means that atr ranges of both time frames are at their narrowest, and signals given by other indicator will have good price action( as again atr ranges of 1 minute and 5 minute time frames will expand)  
  
for sell signal qwma line of lower time frame should be below higher time frame-(e.g.- 15 minutes qwma should be below 1 hour qwma to take sell trade-- what it means is that atr ranges of prices of 15 minutes is below the atr ranges of 1 hour time frame ) like wise i analyse from higher tf to lowe tf to see which signal is right(i.e which tf atr range is lower and which tf atr range is higher)  
  
when prices breaks atr range of one time frame it enters atr range of next higher time frame that is easy to see with qwma-  
  
(e.g first prices moves out of 1 minute atr range to enter 5 minute atr range then take pause at qwma line of 5 minute(center line of your atr band for 5 minute)(median points of price atr ranges of 5 minutes), then will move in atr range of 15 minutes to hit qwma line of 15 minute tf(center line of your atr band for 15 minutes)(median points of price atr ranges of 15 minutes) and will pause there,,,,,.... so on for all tf. so this lines(higher time frames are targets and sl)  
  
macd(stlm histogram) more or less behaves in line with atr ranges so shows moves in sync with qwma of time frame  
  
one version of qwma was released in 2016 that i was using and now new one is released, attaching both here  
  
thanks friend.

Hi Brijesh. Could you please give the .rar or .zip set up chart you often used?  
I saw it many indicators, and i cant decide which one is the most effective. 

Profit growth tells you the trader ability.

you can first try it on demo or strategy tester with your system you use for trading to see what suits you the best,  
  
the one which brings you close to winning probability is good enough as there is no holygrail available.

Thanks, but isn't it disturbing, not to take a long trade just because some much higher timeframe qwma is above actual price? How do you determine sl tp?  
Which alert or strength indicator do you use to find the most volatile pair?  
  
I added a new stema with atr-bands, but I prefer the standard one. Some mq4 versions are in my older posts here.

As I tried to tell you last year, atr bannds is normal ma! The atr volatility calculation is only for the bands distance. When you deactivate the outer bands, you have a normal ma  
as usual:  
0=sma, 1=ema, 2=smma, 3=lwma  
0=close, 1=open, 2=high, 3=low, 4=median, 5=typical, 6=weighted

when two time frame qwma comes at touching distance to each other it means that all lower time frames averages are converging( all lower time frames atr are converging) this are best opportunities for trade, as again all lower time frame averages will diverge, in mt4 there is restriction of time frame to be used to limited time frames available, so qwma helps to see what is happening to all lower time frames, see attached image. (try using qwma templet on odd time frames like 23 minutes, 45 minutes, 33 minutes ...... so on, to see what i mean, using period converter indicator)  
  
oma ribbon does the same thing to show convergence and divergence of lower time frame averages as is macd. stlm histogram shows the same , in which direction averages are converging and diverging.  
  
you can reduce qwma time frames to be loaded on chart, keeping next 2 higher timeframes, to keep chart clean , as all lower timeframes will align to higher timeframe trend always.  
  
I use this convergence of qwma of multitime frames,( multitime frame convergence of averages to find when price strength will come, (This is followed by divergence of multitimframe averages again)  
  
  
when two time frame qwma are touching each other, that price high or low are good sl, as in trending market that will not be tested as in image

All is a good description and trades will have a high success rate, if you wait as you describe, until the market falls again and respects that area, but do you only trade when price is near two qwma of next higher timeframes? Does it work in lower timeframes? How do you trade in ranges like these days, when only news make big moves?

i assess first on higher time frames to see what is the trend. then come down to my trading time frames,  
  
it works on all timeframes, but i wait for right opportunity to arise, as mentioned in image , for all time frame averages to converge(all time frame trend to align) as much as possible and then to see moving averages to converge on my traded time frames, to minimise risk and improve reward probability.  
  
i do not trade ranges, i only trade on trending moves(only in direction of trend), as even though i am bit wrong in my entry , trend will take care of it.  
  
as prices moves faster when averages converges on multitime frame, what i know is my position should get in profit quickly(though i give it a bit of time) and sl should not be tested, if that does not happen then i consider my self wrong in assesment of trend or i am trading sideways market  
  
when i see ranges on any time frame i switch to higher timeframes to see for reason, as it is always that prices has hit some important sr (moving average, fibbo levels, trend lines)levels on higher time frame that is why it is ranging in lower time frames

when averages converges in multitimeframes use this indicators to find out when strength of prices starts(this indicators shows in mtf on chart screen when strength starts), with rest system indicators alignig  
  
rsi settings-7, rest as it is , dmi setting-7, rest as it is.

Any chance to see the code? to see how it is being used? what's inside ?

That's 1090 mt4 bug, click several times in editor on compile or use ex4-files directly.  
@Brijeshsinh:  
Which dshboards do you use and which alert do you have on every chart, so that you don't have to look to often on every chart. I suggest to add volume calculation:  
money flow index 14 bands at 20 50 80. Some combine it with rsi 8 over 50. Both over 50 is often profitable long, over 80 is overbought. These guys use that to make ads (on chart and pop up) on their system and ban everybody, who tells like me to live without their stolen idea and with free indicators. EMA 8 and 20 is also a good choice.  
Don't rename mrtools indicators like the Mfi smoothed floating levels (not in pic). Brown atr-bands are described in my older posts.

Thanks. Don't you use another very simple template just for alerts. Otherwise your mt4 freezes on news. You should also always make indicators/Downloads folders in the rar, so that all can see the beauty.  
  
I like the jurik ma, Quadratic Weighted Moving Average as you use (qwma) seems to be not the best ma to me.  
Readers: What is your favourite ma that does not alert too often and not too late?

Your settings:  
Adaptive jurik filter(mtf + alerts + fl's)---  
jurik and filter period to use-20  
jurik adaptation period to use-999999999  
color change- on slope change  
level type-quantile  
price to use- close  
jurik phase -0  
jurik atr phase adaptation-0  
filter to use-0  
filter should be applied- apply filter to all  
jurik atr adaptation smooth double- false  
jurik smooth double=false  
  
You seem to like adaptivness, but that's not a holy grail as you get more false signals. More adaptive is this one, mladens t3 with atr bands, of course. Jurik is internally very adaptive.  
Why no activated floating levels (fl)?

using in mtf mode templet makes it heavy on mt4 if multiple charts are open, need to keep number of charts to low to prevent freezing. i do not face this problem frequently as i keep only 5 to 7 charts open at a time.  
  
t3 falls between slow and fast ma-as is seen well optimised in step oma 2.3 mtf, jma being fastest, setting on it remains tricky, to prevent false signals and keep it smooth running till trend lasts and still get fast exit and entry. this version being smoothened and atr adaptive makes it setable to it, with tricky settings though.  
using quantile and floating levels either makes a small difference only, quantile i seem to have matching bit more to macd, averages convergence divergence, but you can set it as needed.  
  
seeing moving averages convergence and divergences with qwma templet and then seeing jma fl templet (jma being fast, moves faster with price action then qwma and step oma 2.3 mtf)this version( both on mtf mode) to take faster entry and exit can be useful , when qwma mtf and jma fls mtf templets seen simultaneously . better still if used on higher time frames.  
  
or combine it in your trading timeframe for better visibility

you are fine technical analyst so you understand the all good work of mladen and mrtools for making this adaptive versions and publishing them, all thanks to both of them, readers will find their way out of rar files.

Better use the corrected version, good work. Alligator or rainbow indicators are similiar to mas of posted Light Forex System. But don't fill the colored outer ma the same purpuse as the 12 in between, same for 5 kst?  
I prefer integrated settings of atr-bands as discussed 2017 here for example:

Problem is, that ma crosses yellow-blue occur up to 11 bars later (sma 28 shift -11 yellow ma, blue shift +3), the I also know the trend.  
Better instead of 2 step oma with same settings use one with higher sensivity and ma.

try using mt scanner indicator, it scans using super trend, set supertrend settings to 10 , and 1.7 and it will work in line with step oma 2.3 mtf indicator.  
so it makes it easy to scan every instruments

Hi Brijeshsinh  
  
I am interested in the SDA v3.2. I read the code of it but I could not understand what you want to do(I am not a programer).  
Would you explain the contents and intention of this indicator??  
  
Now I am testing it and confirm that it is very useful(I don't know the content.... so that is why I would like to know the content).  
  
Thanks

Hi Brijeshsinh. I see many posts with too many indicators posted on this thread, but I'm not sure which ones to use? Can you make one zip file with all necessary indicators, dll files and templates that are needed for this system?

___________________________________________  
MOVING AVERAGES AND TIME ZONE DIVISION( equal division of price zones and time zones by factor - 4)( to match for all crucial H4 candle closing timing, as major exchange like US, london and tokyo's session opeing and closing time falls on closing hours of H4 candles where most of moves comes)( last few moments on any candle is very important for decisive move to take place)(opening and closing time of exchanges is where volume is generated, opening price is set up by amatuer traders and closing prices on exchange is set up by professional trades)( closing prices of session is the price which is the closest to the interbank close price)  
______________________________________________  
___________________________________________________  
  
50 ema Daily =13 ema Weelky = 5 ema monthly  
200 ema Daily = 50 ema weekly = 13 ema monthly = 5 ema quarterly  
200 ema weekly = 50 ema monthly = 13 ema quarterly =5 ema yearly  
200 ema monthly= 50 ema quarterly= 13 ema yearly  
\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
for instruments traded 24 hours like forex( for charts available all 24 hours)  
  
13 ema D1 = 50 ema H4 = 200 ema H1  
13 ema H4 = 50 ema H1 = 200 ema M15  
13 ema H1 =50 ema M15 = 200 ema M5  
13 ema M15 = 50 ema M5 = 200 ema M1  
\-------------------------------------------------------------------  
for instruments traded during exchange open time( for charts available only during exchange open time)  
13 ema D1 = 50 ema H1 =200 ema M15  
13 ema H1 =50 ema M15 = 200 ema M5  
13 ema M15 = 50 ema M5 = 200 ema M1  
______---------------------------------------  
  
  
so H4 of 24 hours traded instruments = H1 of instrument traded only on exchange hours  
so H1 of 24 hours traded instruments = M15 of instrument traded only on exchange hours  
\--------------------------------------------------------------------------  
so match H4 chart of forex (24 hours chart) to H1 chart of same forex pair with chart available during exchange open time, for better execution when both charts align you have a move available to trade  
\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  
note- M30 is the oddest time frame to trade, avoid trading on this time frame.  
  
zone between 13 ema and 20 ema is all important for short term swing to end, if prices dips below this zone and does not come back above it fast in next few candles , brace for reversal to come and break of this 13 ema and 20 ema zone will flip atr of prices to other side.( usually with large and fast price action bar that will less likely to reverse as it breaks multiple timeframe averages, in one bar and catches all traders to wrong side and sets panic in traders to make them square off their positions in panic)  
  
in all time frames 50 ema is the equilibrium point, from where next price action begins and price strength comes  
50 ema = 50 level on rsi (14) = centerline of macd= centerline of stlm histogram  
  
  
\-----------------------------------------------------  
daily close(interbank close), weekly close, monthly close, quarterly close, yearly close prices are very strong sr levels

as 13 ema and 20 ema zone is all important, as described above in context to division of averages and time frames  
this is how market behaves in all time frames with 13 ema and 20 ema zones in all time frames, with moving averages and price action  
all is convergence and divergence of this zones in multiple timeframes.  
now with mt5 with more timeframes available it is more easy to see it .  
thanks to mladen and mrtools that some good indicators with color coding helps to see the things easily on chart.  
mrtools also published one good indicator qwma adaptive fl, which shows the same thing , as described previously in this thread, the same zone and moving averages division works with it too with specified settings on it.  
many thanks to him also.  
  
The best average true range period to trade with is 10  
Avg Range indicator settings-  
atr period-10  
time frames- d1-1440  
w1 -10080  
\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
d1 atr range reaching 100% shows limited scope for further move for the day( that gives idea of how much space is left for the move on daily basis)  
w1 atr range reaching 100% shows limited scope for furthe move for the week ( that gives idea of how much space is left for the move on weekly basis)  
  
  
\---------------------------------------------------------  
  
how to trade - and anticipating when price stength will emege -  
  
in any time frame 13 ema and 20 ema zone is make or break zone for short term swing to end  
prices falling below this zones will flip the atr to the other side for that time frame  
this templet shows all timeframes zones( of 13 ema and 20 ema ) for this in single chart using moving average rainbow  
best entry points-- when there is convergence of this zones with each other, more timeframes converges at a point the stronger the move, and more the higher timeframes converges the longer the trending move to emerge  
step oma 2.3 mtf indicator -arrow appearing after convergenc of two timeframes indicates that prices are falling out of atr zones , and are ready for the move.  
  
SimpleEMAv2 13 ema mtf indicator shows the convergence of this zones too.  
  
at convergence points- ema guppy trend display shows all time frames turning and helps in entry when all timeframes align( all lower timeframes blue color for up move, or all red color for down move)  
atr 10 in seperate window with stlm shows the last 10 period move in pips, for the given time frame and you can set your targets accordingly .  
\------------------------------------------------------------------  
how to filter sideways markets--  
  
take position only when there is convergence of this zones preferably higher time frame zone convergence for entry on lower time frame.  
  
do not trade when there divergence of this zones as sideways market will follow after divergence of this zones away from each other, and price will mean reverse again .(counter trend)  
trade only in direction of the trend.  
\-------------------------  
macd and stlm histogrm shows when there is deceleration of the momentum coming  
  
  
indicators to go in mql4/indicator/Downloads folder  
  
ema guppy trend display - ma =5,13,14

prices will tend to pull back towards the previous days close prices often before resuming its move for the day, as previous days close price is the most important for major banks,( interbank close), so is very important is the close at US market closing prices,  
and exchange close price for stocks and indexes  
  
  
\------------------------  
more optimal setting of jurik_smooth_ribbon_nmc( to match with macd on chart)  
smooth 1 period=12  
smooth price= close  
smooth 1 phase= o  
smooth 2 period=50  
smooth price= close  
smooth 2 phase= o  
\--------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
  
  
for any country's currency, two close price are important  
one is where is the close price on that country's interbank platform close. and other is where is close price of that country's currency on US session close(as that is decisive for daily candle close)  
depending on how is closing on us session , the next day prices will open on that country's interbank platform and then will pull back to the previous day's close price on that country's interbank platform, and then again restart the move for the day in the direction of the trend.  
this is also true for any other instrument like stocks and indexes  
only in <10% of the time when there is very strong trend that this pull back to country's interbank close price level will be shallow.  
  
  
price and volume move will come at  
london open  
tokyo close  
us open  
london close  
us open  
\----------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
extreme spike indicator-  
  
no repaint- true  
minormin extreme height atrs = 1  
major to minor height ratio =2.5  
minormin extreme width =2  
majorminextreme width =2

anticipating the price reversal bar at convergence points, with ema extrapolated indicator  
if prices breaks this grey line , with fast and large price action bar which is running towards the trendline to break it , the move is on, as traders are caught on wrong side, and will run to close their positions in panic.  
this is extrapolation so all lines will readjust.  
so do not focus on lines.  
\-----------------------------------------------------  
only one criteria to find reversal bar.  
focus only on last price bar. and its last status with line at that bar(current grey line and not red future line)  
the bar that closes below or above this current grey line is reversal bar.( important to note is close of bar, price may dip below this line but till bar does not close below or above the line on closing basis it is not reversal bar)  
till this closing of price bar on the other side of the line does not happen it is continuation of trend.(once again to remind- close of candle is to be taken in to account)  
\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
this is not for signalling but for anticipation, but this is good extrapolation of ema.  
  
\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
ema extrapolated indicator  
settings-  
ema period=1  
bands deviation=2  
last bar in the past data=0  
number of past bars=200  
number of bars to predict=50  
total number of harmonics in model=8  
tolerance of frequency calculations=0.0001  
calculate on every tick =true  
  
analyse in context with other indicators and systems.

Hey, do you trade by any rule set, especially regarding the quantum bands (qwma)? Is it like a zone not to trade in or how shall it be utilized?

Hi!  
  
I am currently trying to use the indicator and template with the latest MT5. Unfortunately, I and a friend who also tried it always get an error message: "GDI Cache - object creation error [0]". Can someone help me? I do not know why this error comes. I use the MT5 from GBE Brokers. Thanks!
