Thank you.  
  

THE DRAGON HAS BEEN BORN FROM THESE FORUMS.  
THE DRAGON LIVES.  

  
  
The dragon is not a mindless mechanical automaton. The dragon is alive. Like any creature faithful to its master, the dragon is ready to serve. Like a seeing eye dog, or a thoroughbred horse at the Kentucky Derby, a trained falcon. The dragon takes pride and aims to please.   
  
If treated appropriately, with respect and appreciation, the dragon will perform very nicely. The dragon amasses victory after victory when in the hands of a suitable master. One who is disciplined. Determined. Patient. And confident of ultimate success.   
  

**ARE YOU READY FOR THE DRAGON?  
THE DRAGON IS READY FOR YOU!!!  
**

  
We can start with a description of the anatomy:  
  
The body of the dragon is composed of heiken ashi candles, heiken ashi smoothed, and 3ema calculated from the heiken ashi smoothed.  
  
The landscape surrounding the dragon has a 200 ema and daily woodie pivots.  
  
The monitoring of the internal conditions of the dragon is done by dss stoch and macd with crossing.  
  
The idea is to anticipate the dragon's moves and be able to ride the dragon. There is much to be gained by anticipating the direction the dragon is going and staying for a ride. The dragon can take one for a great ride to riches and wealth. But if the attempting rider boards incorrectly there can be devastation.   
  
The dragon is giving clues and hints and is very happy when the rider is successful. The dragon wants the rider to be successful. In that way a great friendship and partnership develops. Learning to listen to the dragon.....  
  
This is what the dragon looks like.  
  
_We are working on developing an ea for the dragon.  
Will keep the ea download in progress up to date on this page.  
It is in very crude and beginning stages.  
Please do not try to use the dragon ea for live trading it is only in developmental stages.  
_

Heiken ashi is very significant. The ha candle clearly define the direction.   
  
_The idea is to board the dragon when he is about to change direction._  
  
He changes direction a lot but not all of these changes of direction are good for getting on board.  
  
When heiken ashi changes color that is an alert that a good boarding time may be coming.  
  
It is important to note what the general direction the dragon is going in. He meanders a lot.   
  
The best time is when he pauses, retraces a bit, and springs forward again in the original direction.  
  
The landscape is important. The dragon may be paused near a woodie pivot or s or r area for refreshments. He tends to be very sensitive to these. And he is drawn irresistibly to the 200 ema. The affinity there is very strong.  
  
As the dragon moves along the landscape his internal condition can be monitored. What he is contemplating.  
  
dss stoch monitors when he has enough.  
and macd with crossing confirms when he has indeed changed his mind...either temporarily or in a big way...  
  
It takes some practice to get to know the activities of the dragon. But they are knowable. He is very beautiful. Powerful. And able to bestow immense riches. He is not attached to anything. He is indifferent. And only he knows perfectly the market place.   
  
A good friend to have.

My relationship with the dragon is unique to me. I go for rides on the 1 min time frame.  
I consult higher time frame dragons, since the dragon is a fractal being.  
Let me show you some photo shots of our activities. You know the old photo album....   
  
with comments on trades.  
This was a practice session using a simulator.  
  
#1 macd and dss favored a move down, but I did not wait for ashi candles to go green, as a result I entered too early, had to ride out a small correction, but this is the benefit of always trading with the trend, because the primary trend was down, the trade was good.  
  
#2. same thing,  
evidently what I am thinking is that I am missing a big move, and indeed there may be a big move in the making, but where the entry is makes a huge difference... always wait for the ashi candles.... they are a a first class indicator based on price action.....  
  
#3. took a chance on a counter trend move, in real trading I most likely would not do that, bad habit, that's good way to get my head handed to me on a platter... lucky only.... silly me, I have so many bad habits that just won't seem to die, Pain of realizing a loss in bad trades may be the only way to really kill them... stubbornness that's all...   
  
#4.little early, dss was not fully overbought, but ha candles confirmed and the bounce down from s2...  
  
#5.[http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/s...im/chicken.gif](http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/smilies/yim/chicken.gif) got the entry right, but didn't ride the move. All three confirmations were very strong, plus good bounces down from 200 ema and s2, just [http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/s...im/chicken.gif](http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/smilies/yim/chicken.gif)  
  
#6. counter trend, but time of day and way oversold conditions said ripe for a retrace. Still it would be better if I didn't jump for those...   
  
After a big move sometimes the correction is not very great. It lapses into a sideways consolidation even though macd and dss look like roller coaster tracks. The dragon does not actually go anywhere. Buying and selling is going on but the dragon is not moving. An end of day fade can bring a few pips but then again the risk is there for me because of my schedule that I will get caught in the trade and have to rollover. Then I have to take rest also and I really don't want to carry a trade overnight. When I log off I want to be entirely out of the mkt until the next day...[http://cdn.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&d=1264237106](http://cdn.forexfactory.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=399396&stc=1&thumb=1&d=1264237106)

Here is what I would look for:  
This is a minor reversal..  
  
(of course this analysis is being performed post mortem but it can give the idea)  
  
1\. ashi candles changing color from olive to green after a significant run..  
_Maybe the dragon is related to the chameleon family , he changes color.._.  
2\. fresh macd cross a good distance from 0 line. Strongly suggests the dragon has changed his mind.  
3.dss stoch suggests he has had enough and is ready for a change...  
4.he has crossed above ashi smoothed which has also changed colors. and 3 ema calculated to ashi smooth is below ashi smoothed and facing upwards...  
5.he is most likely headed for 200 ema, a favorite which also happens to coincide with r1 2 favorites in one place, hard for him to resist.

if you want to play with the dragon a bit there is a simulator.  
to buy: click on buy and move the word buy up, to close the position move the word buy back down  
to sell do the same by clicking on sell.  
here is the indi for the simulator

The dragon is alive. You must first make friends with him. Observe his movements. Get to know his habits.   
To try to get aboard him is not mechanical. He will throw you off... The signals are there. But if you have not made some friendship with him, followed him for a while, made friends so to speak you will not be able to recognize when he is telling you get on board.   
He is not a machine. He is a living being.   
If you do not make friends with a horse and simply try to hop up on him he may buck. Or if you try to board a horse from the wrong side he may buck.   
Just watch the dragon move through his landscape and watch the monitors for his internal state for a while then we can discuss signals in more detail.

yes what matters the technicals, of course..  
However, the mastery of the technicals is not technical!!!!  
Mastery (of the technicals for those who are indeed to become actually successful, which is a very few out of the many, many people who try) is sublime. Cannot be forced by brute force.   
It is like fine tuning a delicate musical instrument...  
The difference between playing chopsticks with 2 fingers on a piano and a concerto.  
Just to give someone a golf club is not going to help them become a masters pro.   
What I have is not so easily transmitted...  
I am willing to transmit. But the receiver must be qualified to receive...  
Chopsticks or a concerto?

practice session with notes on trades  
If you can follow my notes on these trades it will help you to understand the dragon's movements.  
Better yet practice trading on the demo or simulator.  
  
A simple exercise:  
Use a simplified template for this exercise. Delete the 2 lower windows, the dss and the macd. Delete the woodie pivots and the 200 ema.  
Look for ashi change of color. Go long when ashi turns green after a significant move down. And go short when ashi turns olive after a significant move up. With a 1 minute dragon look for 3 to 5 pips.   
  
This is what is called buying into weakness and selling into strength.  
  
This in itself is not sufficient for success. But play with it as an exercise. It will help you to become more familiar with how the dragon moves.  
  
The folowing practice session is with the 15 min dragon. Live I trade the 1 minute but the dragon moves too fast on the 1 min setting so I use the 15min. for practice.  
  
#1. I zoomed out (not shown) to identify the predominant trend. It was down.  
The dragon was at the top of a downward channel. He had tested the 200ema 2 times and turned back down each time. Macd suggested he was turning down and dss stoch suggested he'd had enough. He did test the 200 ema a 3rd time but the ride down was good. ha candles were changing color to olive from green and ha smoothed was changing color also. It was a very dramatic move. Waiting until dss says the dragon's move is ending is a good exit sign. But I invariably jump off sooner. As I become more and more familiar with how he moves I will feel more confident about staying on for a longer period of time. For now. Thank you and take the pips...  
#2 not the best entry point. ha candles had just turned green and were now olive again. dss was making a series of lower retracings showing just how strong the downward move was. hopped in then hopped out right away.   
#3 hopped back in as the dragon dropped below s1 heading most likely for s2. again thank you and take the pips..  
#4. waiting for ha candles to change color was not going to happen in this dramatic move dss suggested that was all there was going to be for a retrace and the dragon may be heading for s2.   
  
Was considering entering short again that s2 was a viable destination but  
macd did not confirm any further downside as there was a very big difference in the angle of macd heading up and the dragon's sort of sideways dilly dallying...   
Time of day is very significant. The best moves are when there is a lot of trading action. This was getting toward NY close...

just to illustrate how significant the daily wood pivots are the dragon has been stripped down to bare bones...  
there are 10 points of interest on this 30 min view where the dragon has reacted noticeably to the pivot levels.  
#1 bounced off s3  
#2 tested and tested and finally broke through the main pivot  
#3 reached r1 and reversed  
#4 fell in a dramatic straight shot from r1 to s3  
#5 bounced up to test s2  
#6 fell to s1 and fell thru s2 on the way to s3   
(interesting to note that sometimes an s or r from the previous day still has power the dragon didn't reach s3 until the next day and formed a double bottom there)  
#7 & #8 tested the main pivot  
#9 dropped back to test the main pivot for the next day  
#10 hovered around r1  
  
In the landscape these pivots are very significant, regardless of what else might be going on. They are part of the dragon's world as much as off and on ramps are part of our experience of driving the freeway.

another significant part of the dragon's landscape is the 200 ema  
There are 7 points of interest on this 30 min view.  
(The dragon is not so stripped down as in the woodie pivot study. He's looking more dignified this way).  
#1 distance from 200 ema is very great the dragon will turn back to the 200 ema  
#2 the dragon tests the 200ema 3 times  
#3 bounces high only to test for a 4th time and then a 5th time to finally break through  
#4 distance from 200 ema is very great and the dragon turns back up to test  
#5 test the 200ema and drops back down in a very dramatic move.  
#6 distance from 200 ema is very great and the dragon again turns back up to test the 200 ema  
#7 tests the 200 ema.  
  
The 200ema is like the dragon's shadow. He can never really get away from it.

putting the landscape components together on the same 30 min view and leaving the points of interest for the 200 ema  
it is interesting to note how the 200 ema and the woodie pivots with s/r coincide at very significant turning points for the dragon.

From and earlier post:  
A simple exercise:  
Use a simplified template for this exercise. Delete the 2 lower windows, the dss and the macd. Delete the woodie pivots and the 200 ema.  
Look for ashi change of color. Go long when ashi turns green after a significant move down. And go short when ashi turns olive after a significant move up. With a 1 minute dragon look for 3 to 5 pips.   
  
This is what is called buying into weakness and selling into strength.  
  
This in itself is not sufficient for success. But play with it as an exercise. It will help you to become more familiar with how the dragon moves.  
  
Adding woodie pivots and the 200 ema to the template the simple exercise from the earlier post can now be done with the added benefit of awareness of the landscape.   
  
If the dragon is approaching a pivot special attention is given to how he behaves there. Is he testing and will he break through?  
How far is he from the 200 ema?   
All the while watching for the ha candles to change color.   
The pivots can be good destinations. The dragon likes to go there.   
He can never get too far from the 200 ema without returning to it at some point.

Exercise #1  
Following the suggested exercise described previously here are some results.  
Please remember that this is not a complete trading system. It is a simplified template. The landscape is not there and also the internal indicators are not there. This just follows the meanderings of the dragon.  
His bodily movement.  
A good practice is to zoom out and try to identify the overriding trend. In the zoom out we can see what looks like a reversal from big uptrend to some downside...  
So we will look for entries based on downtrend... that is where the momentum will be and also if the entry is not right the worst that can happen is being stuck for a ride while the dragon retraces a little... But he is sure to continue down after he is done.  
first is the zoom photo shot (I had to reload the photoshot so the zoom shot is now at the end of the post)  
then the actual trade shots with the settings visible on the simulator.  
setting is 15 min, live trading I would do on the 1m. but the simulator moves too fast to make any realistic practice possible using the 1min on the simulator.  
then the results... not bad...for a practice session..  
remember also we are only looking to see how to become a little familiar with how the dragon moves and to see if we can identify reasonable entries. We are not concerned with exits here. That will come later..  
Have a go at it. Use this exercise over and over and over. So that when we add the other components you will have the basic form down pat. Etch his movements in your brain so that when you lie down to take rest you will see the dragon. Pleasant dreams..  
Practice, practice, practice and more practice..  
#6 and #7 were very short trades trying to capture the little bit of upside in a brief retrace. Not a good idea to do usually when the main trend is down. But it can be done occasionally.   
When just starting out better not to. Part of the lesson is to learn self control and only act on predefined rules. This was border line, since the minor trend had turned upside. __However it can be a very good way to get your head handed to you on a platter.__ Try it a few times and you will see the dangers.

I can continue on to show the whole system.  
But I want to know.  
Is anyone following this?  
Are there any questions?

thanks...  
Presenting the system is helpful to me as well as to anyone who may be trying to learn something or enhance their trading skills.   
Feedback and questions are very helpful and welcome.  
The only dumb question is the one that didn't get asked.

To try to follow all of it at once is not a good idea. Too much at once.  
So first the dragon's body movements  
then his landscape   
and then eventually what is going inside his mind...  
so next is adding his landscape...  
It'll take a little while to get it ready  
but I will post an example of the 2nd exercise adding the landscape to the template.  
let me know how how you are doing if you try this...  
thank you  
these are only practice exercises....   
**__simulator and demo only please!!__**

adding the landscape..  
the pivots and the 200ema..  
This is a very instructive session.  
Please note we are only looking for safe entries, exits will come later.  
Sometimes the best action is not to trade!!!!  
The dragon is best when there is a clear trend. There are different kinds of trading systems. So many... Some are good in range trading. The dragon is best when the trend is very clear.   
For this session after the zoom out it was not all that clear what the trend was. Suggesting a consolidation day may be in store.   
Trying to trade consolidation day with a trend system is exactly like walking into a whirling helicopter blade...  
This session is very good to show a number things.  
#1 This shows the 200ema (thick lime green line) as flat. Dead giveaway there is no trend. The pivot (thick yellow line is just above the 200ema.  
The dragon will tend to hang out there for quite some time. He will bounce between the 2 and sometimes move above a little bit and sometime below a little bit. This situation occurs very frequently. He is resting.  
Getting ready to move away. Until we know which direction he is going to go just don't trade!!!  
_The worst that can happen is you won't make any money, but that is a heck of lot better than losing money..  
#2. _After a candle (turning olive) pullback, ever so slightly, the dragon headed up. that would be a valid entry. considering he is leaving his resting area and has just pulled back briefly. As you can see it was a pretty significant move up and when we add the indicators we will be able to evaluate exits, but this is simply an exercise to find entries, so we jumped out right away...  
#3 He tore right through r1 without even catching his breath and stopped just short of r2. Without the benefit of getting a glimpse of his inner thinking (the indis) we did not enter short.   
#4 But just see how significant the pivots and the 200 ema are. he just can't stay away.

No. no repainting. Once the bar closes that's it..  
the indis are a macd at default settings with a vertical line programed in for the crossing   
and the dss is actually a stochastic just represented by dots rather than seeing the lines cross, the change of color of the dots is the same as the lines crossing. A little easier to read the dots...  
They are very standard indicators..  
This photo shot shows the correlation

The benefit of using the indicators is that it allows us to view the thinking of the dragon..  
After he took a bit of a run up he tired. Felt he'd had enpough for a little while.  
The macd shows this with the cross. especially since the cross appears high above the 0 line...  
macd is funny, sometimes the dragon can just keep going and going, crossing and then recrossing. so without the change of color of the ashi candles and a cooperative dss it is really too risky to trade for a scalp.  
The dss also confirms with the downward red dots...  
this may not be much of a downward move but it is good for a few pips  
it is countertrend, but sometimes they are alright, just not for much of a move usually...

as we can see, the dragon only briefly paused...  
I would hesitate to enter long until I could see if he was simply putting in a top.  
I could know this by seeing if there was a divergence in the macd developing.  
the dragon going higher but the macd (his inner thoughts) going lower. So he was going higher but he was definitely losing interest in continuing higher for much longer.  
I will be able see this by the behavior of the dss.  
If the dss reaches a high point and the dragon does not really moved much that wouldbe another clue as to what he is thinking...

a divergence has developed in macd.  
and dss has reached a high point while the dragon has not gone higher proportionately.  
divergence cannot always be trusted.  
remember these indis are registering the dragon's thinking...  
and he can and does change his mind......  
his actions speak louder..  
so ashi candles must confirm.  
his affinity for the 200ema is also undeniable.

there are many other tools that can be used to evaluate.  
for these sessions we are keeping this as simple as possible.  
By reading higher time frames a lot can be understood.   
fibs, trend lines, but for these sessions we are trying to keep it simple.

this is scalping technique.  
there is most likely a lot more downside to the dragon.  
I have closed early...

Hi Jiva,

hi. does it matter that when macd has crossed, DSS stoch has already changed colours for a long time? or the best entries are when macd crossing coincides with dss colour n candle colour changes?

Hi Jiva  
  
What does it mean when there is separation between the 2 HA Indicatiors?  
  
I really like your system and I'm having some sucess with it but I need to understand I little some of the small issues. I had 5 of 6 winners for +80 pips during NY Session BUT 1 of 5 winners in Asian session.  
  
Thanks for your input - please don't give up on this thread. It's simple enough for me to understand and I think I can be successful with it if you stay with it!!!

It is not so cut and dry, "when this then that", especially with macd and dss. After all they are simply measuring what the dragon is thinking... And just like us, he can and does change his mind frequently and sometimes quite quickly.  
There are a number of other things to consider. We will get to it.  
This weekend I can prepare some posts to explore the use of the macd and dss.   
Till then,  
good luck...

please practice the first two exercises.   
Practice as much as possible.   
Like a musician who practices getting used to the basics, the scales, the fingerings, until they become second nature.   
Then the music... later...  
The dragon is not a mechanical system.

Where to start?  
okay...  
The dragon..   
So far we have practiced following his movements. Tried entering on ashi candle change of color, then we added his landscape the pivot points, s/r, and the fantastic 200 ema... His favorite places to visit.  
Now we can explore what he is thinking..  
Especially the dss.. It is a default stochastic just expressed as dots in place of line crossings.   
Let's start with the dss.  
In the following chart we can see that the dss takes big swings but the dragon doesn't move.   
He is sleeping. The dss is showing his dreaming. Just like when we dream. It seems real but all we are doing is lying in our bed asleep.  
Macd confirms the snooze. macd is flat along 0....  
dss is really the true internal guage of the dragon's mental state. macd is also very very useful but it is based on moving averages. Dss is measuring his appetite or desire for buying or selling. His desire... And he will be motivated to move to satisfy his desires. That is certain... But sometimes he may just desire and desire and desire and not make a move. Like in his dreaming state. Eventually he will move and in a big way...

In learning the ways of the dragon there are many little tricks.   
I use at least 2 time frames. Actually I have 3 monitors and keep the 1m, 5m, and 15m for EURUSD on the screen at all times. I toggle to the other time frames as well. All of them on mt4. Monthly as well. Even though I am a scalper.   
On the following photoshot is the 1m and the 15 min. What I am looking for on the dss is agreement. Are the dragon's long range longings the same as his shorter term longings.   
On the 15 min time frame the dss shows he has a strong desire to sell. Within that 15 mins there were 2 occurrences on the 1m time frame where he also had a strong desire to sell.  
Shown by the yellow arrows.  
(The entry in between the 2 obvious selling points was valid also based on change of color of the ashi candles and change of color of dss...  
we are not looking at macd here... just dss...(But if we were we would see the macd crosses on the 1m as well)

Exercise #3  
On live demo put up 2 charts of EURUSD. (Simulator and charts offline are not practical to do this exercise)   
A 1m and 5m. On the 5m identify when dss is clearly making a move below 80 or above 20.   
When the dragon has a strong desire to sell or buy. Then on the 1m find when dss is in agreement there.   
This is just an exercise to become more familiar with coordinating the time frames. Practice entering when they agree. The entry is further supported if ashi candles change color also. Olive for a dive below 80 and green for a shot upward above 20. Look for 3 to 5 pips.   
This is just one dynamic between a few of the components of the dragon's world. There are many. But too much at once will not help.  
__Practice practice and more practice...__  
Try different time frames. See what he is desiring on the 30 min and how that affects the 15... What is he desiring on the 1hr? the monthly?   
By identifying his desires like this we can see how to always trade with the trend, so even if our entry is somehow not quite right we can feel confident that although we may have to ride out a retracement that it is indeed only that a retracement and not that he has changed his mind in any significant way, just a temporary diversion from his real longer term desire. And the dragon gets diverted a lot..   
the following screen shot is a continuation from the previous post. The third yellow arrow shows another entry on the 1m that coincides with the 15m dss.  
See if you can get the idea...

I don't want to go too fast. And introduce too much all at once. But I only have a little time on the weekends to put into the thread.  
So here comes some more..  
On the following screenshot a strong desire to buy was identified on the 15m and the same buy desire was seen on the 1m.   
On the 15 the dss did not fully reach below the 20 and come back up. Often this can be a sign of very strong buying move. On the 15m the dragon is approaching the 200ema. A favorite of his. and on the 1m he has broken above the pivot. All this helps to confirm an entry long with target 200 ema on the 15m.

more examples  
the first screen shot shows 5m and 30m in strong buying mood pushing above pivot resistance.  
the 2nd screenshot shows the same situation on the 1m and 15m and what the trade looks like there...

There's more, lot's more... So far these are only bits and pieces of the total system. Let's get the basics down, then we can put it all together.   
So we can know how the dragon moves..  
Let me know how it goes.

Hi  
  
I attached a pic of what I mean. In some cases the 2 HA indicators are touching and in some cases there is a space between them and they appear to be longer as well. Does that mean anything or is that just the way the indicators are?  
  
Also, does it matter that the DSS is going down well before the change in trend/price?  
  
Thanks - I appreciate your examples. I need to learn more about the Dragon. Right now sometimes I get it sometimes I don't.

Thank you for posting. Your chart looks fine.   
It's going to take a while for all the pieces to come together. We have to get to know the dragon. We can not know him in his entirety all at once. Over the course of associating we come to know him. So the more you can watch his movements the better.   
Like a cat watching a fish bowl. With rapt attention.   
.[http://www.fotosearch.com/bthumb/FSD.../x22295597.jpg](http://www.fotosearch.com/bthumb/FSD/FSD431/x22295597.jpg)  
  
To try to address your specific questions...  
**_In some cases the 2 HA indicators are touching and in some cases there is a space between them and they appear to be longer as well. Does that mean anything or is that just the way the indicators are?_**  
Yes I see the spaces. I'm sure it indicates something. I have not tried to analyze this for my own decision making.   
Since this has caught your attention it may be that over a period of time some helpful bit of insight may come to you from the dragon himself.   
He may be revealing to you personally something about himself that you will be the fortunate one to understand in your unique relationship with him.  
This is what is so fantastic about this system, it is based on a fundamentally different approach. The dragon is a living entity and can communicate with us.   
  
_**Also, does it matter that the DSS is going down well before the change in trend/price?  
**_In general when the dss drops down below 80 it means he is done buying for a while. Or he has lost interest in buying. It doesn't always mean he is interested in selling. Just he has lost interest in buying. That is a good observation that the dss has dropped early. Does it mean that it can predict the dragon will go down soon? Possibly. You would need to look for other instances where this was the case. The more you try to work the system the more it will be revealed to you if that is a good sign to rely on or not.   
I have not tried to use that myself I use additional time frames for reference. You have the 5m posted. I would look at the 15 min to see if this was just a brief pause in his buying and if he was still interested in buying on the 15 min. Like in the previous posts where I used two charts. If dss on the 15 min was going up then I would look to enter when the dss on 5m started to go up again. That is simplified but basically the idea I use.  
_The more you look at the charts and try to follow the more it will start to come to you._ The pieces will come together. It will take time and determination. As you do your own research you will get your own insights.  
The more I work with the dragon the more I think he is unlimited.

Let's take a look at the macd.  
If the dss tells us the dragon's state of mind,  
the macd tells us whether or not and to what degree he is acting on his thoughts.  
From a previous post photoshot the chart shows the dragon sleeping, in his mind there is all kinds of selling and buying going on the dss shows us that, but macd says he is not acting on any of it in any significant way. [http://cdn.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&d=1264840711](http://cdn.forexfactory.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=404924&stc=1&thumb=1&d=1264840711)  
By getting a good grasp of the significance of the indicators we can use them effectively.   
That is why I am taking the time and effort to go into the logic and reasons behind what the dss and macd are measuring.   
Then a cross of macd can be understood in the context of the dragon's overall state.   
Without getting a good grasp of the underlying significance it is exactly like trying to learn to read by rote. There is no comprehension...  
Unfortunately this is the standard of education for institutions in the US and most likely for most of the rest of the world. It's quick and easy. But the results are not very great...

I want to show some screen shots of the dynamics between macd and dss but I will need to do that on a live demo since it will require 2 time frames up on the screen simultaneously and the simulator does not allow for that, and it is not practical to try to do that when the market is closed.  
I can show some simulator trades in the meantime but they will not be as effective...

we need to be able to learn from our errors.   
__Failures are the pillars of success_ , the saying goes.._  
If we are not too proud to own our mistakes or blind spots we can really learn.  
The following screenshot from a simulator session shows a number of things.  
I will qualify this by saying in live trading I would not just have the one time frame for reference. Precisely for the reason this practice session illustrates. There is far too much guess work for me with only one time frame showing.   
#1,#2,#3: dss is dropping rapidly but the dragon is not selling much and macd is climbing nicely.. So I take it that he is distracted by thinking about selling but he is not actually selling, he still wants to buy. No short entry.  
also no long entry, since there is Not enough confirmation for me, (again with a higher time frame on the screen it would help)  
#4 cross of macd, dss in agreement, olive candles.. good for a short scalp.  
#5 cross of macd, dss in agreement, green candles, because the dragon is drawn very strongly to the 200ema, that is a good target.. I try to close going into the move rather than wait for the crest and jump out as he falls.  
The few seconds that the broker takes to finish the order can get me a few more pips if I close going into the move, _whereas that same delay for the broker if the move is over and is now reversing loses pips_...  
#6 again the same conditions cross of macd, dss in agreement, olive candles. I entered alittle too early here, and had to wait out a retracement.  
Again with the benefit of a higher time frame on the screen I could have avoided that.  
#7 the best trade of the day...(lesson time - another pillar) A mistake.. I saw the dss going up the dragon is thinking about buying, but he was not buying... I did not wait for dss to confirm he had given up considering buying and was ready to sell. The macd did give a selling cross I entered short.. Ahhh, the mind, fickle...He decided he would buy after all and I took a loss giving back a good portion of the day's gains. Again, consulting a higher time frame would have helped avoid this.. I guess I just can't emphasize enough the significance of using a higher time frame before making decisions.  
Something to note on this screen-shot is "the zone". The area between the pivot line (thick yellow horizontal) and the 200 ema (thick lime moving average line). The dragon will tend to take a snooze there. Maybe it's like a shady grove for him.... zzzzzz.

Anyone out there following this?

Good job here Jiva,  
  
Informative and fun. I'm enjoying your posts.  
  
I've noticed the higher probability trades are the ones when the macd crosses on the first or second DSS dot after colour change (first or second red or green dot). Seems to be a stronger move when this happens.  
  
What you think?

I agree a 2nd dot for dss is more conclusive. If you notice there is an alert for dss and it sounds and the pop up is there when the 2nd dot forms for a color change.   
Glad to hear the dragon's getting your attention.  
He certainly has mine..

Yeah having the alert definitely makes it easier.

Hi Jiva  
  
Good job - I agree that the second dot of dss is like a confirmation of direction. Also, I think - only by observation - that the separation I spoke of yesterday shows how fast the dragon wants to get where he's going! If you notice how steep the angle when we have those separations.  
  
I look forward to learning more about the dragon and confirming on higher timeframes. We let the dragon sleep until market open!!!

How fast...... Like eager..   
Interesting.   
Let's keep an eye on that and see if there is a way to read the "eagerness indicator".  
I appreciate your eagerness...  
Yes higher times frames is next.....

Just wondering if these trade examples on a M15 was a mistake? Wrong TF?  
  
I understand the need to look at a higher TF, but it appears you are making trade examples off the wrong chart. Thought trades were taken off a M1  
  
thx,

re:15min time frame  
yes, these screenshots are 15 min time frame. They are practice sessions using a simulator program for mt4. In live trading I take trades on the 1m with reference to higher time frames, but the simulator program I have runs way too fast set on 1m to be practical, so I use the 15 min on the simulator. Also it is not possible to have a 1m and say a 5m up on the screen at the same time using the simulator, so it is really limited in a lot of ways.   
If you know of another simulator program I'd be interested in trying it out.  
Thanks...  
Download for this simulator is posted on post #7.

Try this simulator it does everything including opening, closing orders...  
Hope it works for you....put all the files in Experts/scripts---drag it onto chart and under "common" make sure all squares have a check mark except "confirm dll function calls--it should have no checkmark

I don't usually think of posting during trading hours since I want to focus just on trading.  
I did manage to capture a few screen shots that can be useful to illustrate the kinds of things I look for.  
I did not place any trades since I was not confident of any strong setups. However the screenshots are helpful anyway.   
Patience is absolutely necessary in order to be successful.   
The tendency is to trade just for the sake of trading. Not a good practice... __Rather that is a good way to lose money...__  
#1. Look for momentum. The trading session should be active and lively. Not lethargic and not crazy with whipsaws everywhere. Just active and trending.  
#2. The general direction the dragon is moving should be easily identifiable aside from all the little ups and downs.  
#3. Give special attention around data release times. I wait until the data has come out and consider trading after the dragon has decided how he will react.  
If I cannot figure out what is going on I do not trade. Market conditions change very quickly. In a little while the whole scene will change and I will still have capital to trade with. Even if I do not trade for the whole day. So what! I will wait until I know what is going on. Sometimes it may be that the dragon himself does not know what is going on. So how am I supposed to know if he doesn't know?  
I will post the screen shots in a little while.

Hi jiva34   
  
Waiting for your lesson on checking higher time frames. I know it's more important to make money trading - but if you have some time I'm eager to learn.

I use DSS with settings of 10/60 for 1 m charts and 10/30 for 5 m charts.   
Let me know if you like these settings.

okay here we go with some cross reference stuff to multiple time frames.  
I'm used to doing this but at first it can be a little confusing.   
That is why getting the basics down first is really important.  
1\. ashi change of colors for entries  
2\. the landscape and how the dragon is affected by it.  
3\. what he is thinking dss, and how he is acting on that thinking macd.  
(there are _lots_ of other little tricks here and there that can help to minimize risk but step by step is best)  
Using multiple time frames is like the old motion pictures, frame by frame of stills to see the overall movement of a character, or like cartooning... a series of drawings that when flipped through in succession gives the sense of changes through time.

Today was one of those days that I would not trade EURUSD. I kind of got the idea it was going to be like that early on. I focus on the one pair only, EURUSD.  
_The reason I would not like to trade on a day like today is I could not ascertain for certain what direction the dragon was going to take overall._  
I make it a point to enter only in the direction the dragon is most interested in for the long run.   
For the last few weeks he has very obviously been heading down. I would only take short positions. (Maybe a long if it was blatantly obvious all over the place that there was a little upside, even so those kinds of trades are much more risky and can be very expensive just not worth it to me, the stress level is way to high also.)  
  
_As a note: I only trade when I am in a the proper frame of mind. Calm, clear headed, well rested.  
If I have a successful trade I do not immediately jump back into the market.   
I consider that maybe I am even done for the day and walk away.   
After a little while I may come back to the screens and see what is going on. If my frame of mind is clear then I may consider looking for another setup...If I am tired I do not trade.   
The tendency is to want to get right back in after closing a trade.   
If it is a loss then the desire is even stronger. This is a spiral down. **Give me my money back.** It is a trap. Nothing good can come from this type of trading.  
If the trade is winner then the same desire to get back in right is there. **More More More**. Nothing good can come from this type of trading either.  
  
_ The following screen shots shows 4 time frames on the screen at once:  
30m,15m,5m,1m.  
I want to find the dragon's main direction: The 30m will show the stronger trend.  
30m : strong uptrend in dss but in overbought area, possible selling soon.  
slight divergence for uspside macd,   
but strong resistance for dragon at pivot (thick yellow horizontal)  
So 30m not giving a clear message.....  
  
_note: about macd and divergence, divergence is when macd is going one directions and the dragon is moving in the other. macd tells us he is losing interest in continuing on and will change direction. A macd divergence is no longer relevant when the macd crosses the 0 line, and in some case reaches the 0 line and rejects crossing it.)__  
  
15m: almost the same picture exactly at the 30m.  
  
5m: downside indicated. But without being able to identify the dragon's overall intentions I would not take a short position. A move down for the dragon could be very shallow and very risky.  
  
1m. the dragon is hanging out in the shady grove (area between the 200 ema and the pivot)  
  
So not much of help there. No trades...  
_

Well if I can not see anything on these time frames let me try to find his direction on higher time frames.  
hourly, 4h, day, week..  
Where is he going?  
On the weekly he is sitting on very strong support, the 200 ema. He hasn't actually touched the 200ema and still about 100 pips away. A lot of times he will retrace a bit before making a final plunge to the 200 ema. He seems to be getting ready to do that.   
Yup one of those days....   
Even though I trade on the 1 min, I want to know as much of the whole picture as I can. I have a very high success rate that way. But today I can't figure things out. There will be other days where it is clear. No guessing.

Throughout the New York session I kept trying to see if there was any definitive move.  
This screen shot is a zoom out of the 1hr. I was looking for trend lines.  
I came up with a possible scenario,   
given the dragon likes to pull back a bit before his final plunge to a 200ema, and the dss and the macd were saying he may be getting ready to that pullback,   
it seemed reasonable that he could pull up to r1 which coincided with a trend line, (that would give dss time to go into overbought and begin to turn down (as the dragon's appetite for buying became exhausted) and macd would be likely to test the 0 line and reject it at the same time.   
Leaving the way for the plunge to the 200ema from the weekly chart (shown here at the magenta horizontal)  
But I was not about to place any trades on this scenario. It was just something I would keep an eye on, looking for a possible short entry on the 1m at his rejection of r1 and the trend line in order to ride his plunge down.   
Waiting waiting waiting. Went to the store...

Looking more closely at the 4h there could be a macd divergence developing for upside. Something else to keep an eye on.  
(Although I am not placing trades in this study, I think it can be helpful to newer traders just to follow my thinking and see what I am looking for. It is all part of trading.   
Not that a trader has to be in the market all the time.   
A good part of the time trading means doing the research for a trade. The trade itself could be 3 mins. for me. _Those 3 mins can be very lucrative._ The research can take hours. It is all part of trading.

After a little while a macd cross appeared on the 4hr  
and dss turned up.  
I am still trying to ascertain the predominant direction he is going to go.  
I still have the scenario of his simply pulling back a bit before taking the leap down. I do not want to take any long trades since he can turn a dime, and there are no short entry setups.  
No trade..

not wanting to enter long, I am looking for short  
but he is still climbing.   
Is he getting ready to top out here?

There are lots of books out there for traders.  
One book that gave me a read "paradigm shift" was   
**The Profit Magic of Stock Transaction Timing**  
  
by JM Hurst.  
  
It was a very early work and a break through at the time. Like 1920's I believe. Or somewhere around there. JM hurst was not a trader. He was a physicist and he approached the movements of the market like a physicist would. Purely scientific. Matter and energy.   
(Of course now we know there is more to the market than that, he is a creature with a form, a field of activity and desires.....a dragon...)  
JM Hurst's presentation of the movements of what he describes as a physicist "linear movements in curvilinear space" gave me one of those "WOW" moments... His descriptions of this phenomenon opened up the way I view the market ultimately allowing me to meet the creature that lives there.   
Highly recommend the book.   
It may seem a little outdated for some, and maybe esoteric, but I came away with something of value that's hard to describe after reading it. A different sense of spacial relationships and how they interact in the market.

so now it is the 2nd day and still trying to ascertain what the overall direction the dragon is going to take.  
the 4hr   
shows   
macd: divergence with upside bias (not much interest in selling right now but  
that doesn't mean there is a lot of interest in buying, just not much   
interest in selling)  
confusion is that for a macd divergence to play out it usually has to   
either cross the 0 line or approach the zero line and then reject it.  
the dragon seems to be a fairly good ways a way from doing either...  
(to make things even more interesting sometimes macd divergence lies)  
dss entering overbought (dss can stay overbought for a very long time)  
interesting to note dss has rapidly moved into overbought but the   
dragon himself has barely moved at all, not serious about buying?  
Maybe it's limbo again for a while...

For those who are following this thread:   
Is this helping you to see how consulting the higher time frames helps to avoid unnecessary risk?  
Helps to identify when the dragon is moving in a specific direction and what that direction is and when he is just meandering?  
Exercise #4  
Put 4 charts on the screen. 30m,15m,5m,1m.  
Follow the movements of the dragon by identifying the main trend on the 30m.  
use dss and macd. keep special awareness of proximity to pivots and the 200 ema.  
observe the changes in the 15 m, and the 5m as the dragon moves on the 1m.   
Observe how the dss and macd resolve and unwind on the different time frames and how the dragon moves in relationship to these.  
On a demo place trades in the direction of the main trend. See how the condition of the 5m and the 15 min affect the success or failure.   
Tip: When the dss moves dramatically in a certain direction but the dragon doesn't move much at all, it is a clue that he is only thinking about moving in that direction and this could very likely only be a bit of retracing. Consulting dss on the next higher time frame can help confirm this.   
For instance: If dss 1m is going up but the dragon is lethargic  
And dss on 5 min is going down and not yet in oversold  
the dragon is most likely only a little distracted on the 1 min   
and not serious about going very high, he is sure to continue   
down very shortly...   
This dynamic is there between any of the time frames.  
Test this out on demo. Keep an eye for it as you go. It can be very helpful...

Really not the kind of action I feel good about trading.  
But I am a sucker for macd divergence. It's a kind of weakness I have.  
For no other reason than the divergence and support from dss and ashi color change on the 1min.  
jumped in and out.

Tough day to catch any nice trades. Might be like this the whole week leading up to NFP. Not gonna be fun.  
  
I'm enjoying your method though.

Too risky. Too choppy. Some traders may have a method for trading this kind of market. I stay away.   
NFP could be a nonevent.   
From what I am hearing, the present move up is the dragon gobbling up short orders and will likely take him to 1.40 where he will then take out the stops for those orders that are just above 1.40.  
After that it's back down to weekly 200ema and a rest period.   
Who knows after that.   
The 4hr view supports this.  
macd has to resolve before any downside momentum. which means macd has to either cross 0 line to complete the divergence or reach the 0 line and reject it.   
looks like a bear flag......  
timing looks right, turning point for macd and dss near NFP and ISM..  
When the dragon turns for real, the fun will be trading in and out short on the 1 min all the way down. Pretty much risk free even if an entry isn't quite right. Only risk would be having to ride out a very little retracing.  
Well worth waiting for.

1hr also supports the scenario.  
It's just the kind of behavior the dragon has shown before.  
Of course he can and does change his mind, sometimes quickly and dramatically.  
But for now. This is likely.

So far your analysis has proven right.  
Price bounced perfectly off the 200ema on 1hr tf.  
I made a quick 12 pips off that bounce ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

This dragon is a most beautiful creature. Is he not?  
How he loves the 200 ema!!  
How he is drawn to the pivots and s/r.  
He has true character....   
Since he is a "fractal" being, zooming in and zooming we see he is consistent. A dragon all the time....  
Macro or micro. It is he...  
The same wonderful creature...  
He will lead us to great riches.  
Long live the dragon....<http://www.meetdragons.com/d/787-2/odr5.jpg>

Trick:  
toggle through the different time frames on the same chart, marking the 200ema on each by drawing a horizontal line through it.   
These 200 ema levels are significant for the dragon and by seeing them all on 1 chart we can follow his movements.

Use this MTF indicator, instead of toggling between timeframes ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Spectacular day!!  
Simply breathtaking!!!  
The dragon has landed at the weekly 200 ema, which is also the 50 fib for the correction from his highs...  
Now it appears the macd divergence on the 4hr is resolving and his move back up is to commence.  
In his weekly form no doubt he is a little tired and will rest for some time at his favorite place, the 200ema.

still tend to favor the scenario that the dragon will stay right around the 200ema weekly, tendency is for him to drop just below the ma and then come back up through it and sit there for a while, maybe all next week.  
The Spain, Greece, Portugal thing will have played out by then and the worst fears will have driven the dragon to overshoot to the downside.   
Similar to what he did when he reached the 200 ema on the day tf.  
Just one way to see things.

Another indicator I like to use, not always (too many indis clutters things), but some of the time is the trix.  
This is a triple moving average indicator so it very closely resembles the macd.  
Trix tracks the movements of the dragon.  
The arrows are there to show areas to pay special attention.  
They are not automatic "buy" and "sell" signals.  
I find especially useful when trix on a time frame higher than the 1m crosses either the green lower line or the red upper line and begins to come back down.   
These are areas where the dragon has over done it one or the other and will not be able to continue. He will have to turn the other way at least for a little while.   
Used in connection with everything else, this information can help to confirm a safe entry.

Looking at this system i can see you will make pips.  
  
I do have concerns however.  
  
As you earlier insisted, this system is 'Alive' and so is not mechanical like you said.  
  
As this system is not mechanical, when you are trading this with real pounds and pence, you will have issues.  
  
I say this because the lack of a mechanical entry and exit signals means that you are using **your** judgment and **your** emotion.  
I promise you this is very dangerous.  
  
You **Do Not** know what's going to happen in this market, otherwise you would be a multi-billionaire by now.  
  
As this is the case, you cannot use your judgement and "gut instinct" to trade, because there is only a 50% chance of this being right (not good odds to me).  
  
Again, I'm not saying you won't make money with this, I am simply poijnting out a fundamental flaw, which is that you are relying to much on instinct and judgement with this, and I assure you the FX market is "un-judgeable", it will do what ever it wants, regardless of your dragon wanting to soar with the eagles, if the market is going to crash and you listen to your dragon and it wants to fly, your going to get burnt.  
  
By all means trade this my friend, however i really do see this as quite a big flaw.  
  
However, I must say, the concept is pretty cool ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)

Precisely.   
Because the dragon is alive the element of unpredictable is there.  
But to simply approach indicators blindly as if he has to obey the rules with no possibility of exception is the very point.  
I do not see this understanding as a flaw. I do not see that we disa gree in essence.  
The dragon concept rather puts the mechanics and the technicals in perspective. As indicators. They indicate such and such is possible only. Not absolute certainty.   
Then I have the opportunity to make a decision. I do not have to trade a set up if I am not happy with it even if all the so called technicals are in line.   
I think that to overlook the living aspect of both the dragon and myself is a flaw....  
I rather see that to trade in a so called emotionless state is not only impossible but is also unnatural and therefore out of touch with reality.  
Rather a balance must be there. Emotions under control. Not that there are no emotions all. That I believe is an impossibility for a living being.   
The dragon moves influenced by emotions, expectations, desires, fear, etc.  
To ignore this dimension I feel is to miss a vital aspect of the playing field. To have one's own emotions in control is the key to success. Not to deny that there are any emotions at all.  
Best wishes,  
Thank you for your comments.   
Am using another indi that I am finding very helpful.  
rsi 3 smoothed.  
It is the exp 3 moving average of rsi 3.  
A cross of 50 is the alert...  
it is an earlier alert than macd or dss.. but in combination can help to make a decision...   
Happy Chinese New Year to all the dragon people....[http://www.scottyblog.com/wp-content...agon-dance.jpg](http://www.scottyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/dragon-dance.jpg)

humans trade the market. our brains are non linear, so mechanical n linear systems with stiff entry exits are never gona be consistently profitable. that is what i like about the dragon. jiva nailed it on the head. it is a fractal being. i understand the mentality behind those who use mech systems. every1 loves certainty(the shirking of your responsibility to the system), enter here exit there rinse repeat its so straightforward and if they lose they get to blame the system. only when u take ur responsibility in your trading then u will be profitable.   
  
only after throwing all those lagging indicators out of the window. then u will start to develop your own indicator. its called "gut feel" and the more u feel it the more accurate it gets.

Interesting discussion.  
Personally I see it as a matter of balance.  
A system is only as good as the trader trading it.  
Like a great auto. Fast, smooth ride, great tires, etc. but the driver has to use a certain amount of discretion. The road conditions, he may feel some fear if it is icy.. maybe he decides not to drive that day.  
That fear is helpful. He can make a better decision if he feels it.   
Trading is like that for me.   
I have full faith in my system, my good friend the dragon. He has succeeded too many times. So many times. The money is rolling in to be quite honest. Beyond what I really thought could be possible, only dreamed of.   
But I may feel some fear even if the signals are there. Something else may be going on. Some uncertaintly in the marketplace. Greece for instance causing whipsaws. So I respect that fear even if the signals are there and I may chose not to place the trade. Or I may exit early even though the indies are all systems go.  
Each trader is unique in how much risk he can tolerate. How much capital he can trade with, what time frame he is most confident of trading. What system he uses.   
But I think the principle of balance between mechanics and listening to the voice inside is valid for any trader to become actually successful.  
And grow his trading business.   
After all trading is a business.

Took the indi off Trendman's thread while making the rounds on FF a little while back.

Hi Jiva,  
  
I attached a different version of a similar indicator. I don't know how it works but it seems to know when the trend is changing by planting a large dot and then the following smaller dots/lines follow the price. Pretty neat - I think a little more accurately then the Volty Channel.  
  
I think Matrix modified it to his liking.

Hi,  
Happy to hear you might be getting something.  
I can try to explain and share whatever.   
What specifically?

Here's the kind of set up I like to find.  
I saw this set up but I did not take this trade because China is closed all week and US is a holiday all day.I just don't like to trade on strange days like these. Sometime trading is thin or sporadic. There is no data release.   
I don't usually trade on Fridays. And after 12 noon New York...  
Frankfurt open is good, London is good. US is good, Sometimes Hong Kong or Tokyo opens if my schedule allows.  
  
What I look for is as many time frames to agree as possible.  
I watch the 1min. Macd was crossing and on the 5min macd was crossing at the same time from high above the zero line. All the indies were in agreement.  
I really like to see whent he 15 min also agrees. And if the 30 is tending in the same way then most likely it is top (vice versa for bottoms) and good be good for a nice intermediate reversal.  
  
I keep an eye on the higher time frames also.   
But the 1m, 5m and 15 in agreement is enough to enter for at least a scalp, 10 or more pips.  
  
pivots and 200 ema need to be watched.  
On the 5m the dragon was leaving the 200 ema while on the 1m he was heading back to it.  
  
zooming out (not shown) shows that trading is range bound, so the move would not be a big swooping one, just a little dip.   
  
the 15 (not shown) was not in agreement but rather showed a strong tendency upward.  
  
I might have taken a short entry here for the scalp, but really I like to see the 15m in agreement also....

Jiva I DO see your point of view, and I think that a trading system must be suited to the trader, and the trader must be comfortable with what is giving him entry and exit signals. So it's all down to personal preference.  
  
I think I read a reply on here that said mechanical principles will not make consistent profit?  
  
600 pips in 5 days  
  
329 this week and it's not finished yet, I am confident in saying that mechanical systems ARE profitable =]  
  
Again, I believe it's down to preference.  
  
Last note, Jiva I have just realized, our systems are similar in the "dragon" sense, I do not use as many indicators as you, but they are in fact similar =p  
  
I will post a screen shot+my methodology as to why they are similar, soon =]

RE:Mechanical systems  
  
Yes I have to agree the more mechanical a ssytem can be the better. Automation...  
Yes discipline is what makes it successful.  
But profitable isn't enough.  
We get bored very easily.  
So it should also be a little fun.  
Not just making money. But enjoyable at the same time.  
Hence to make friends with the dragon...

always looking how to refine the system.  
am using a color OSMA with custom settings.  
helps to define the trend and locate significant trend changes.  
setting stop above or below swings on the time frame being trades.  
here it is the 15 m has the main stops and targets  
but the 1 min is looked to for swing entries and exits.

Right so here's my system in brief.  
  
I utilize a pair of 50 period simple moving averages of the high & low.  
These then create my channel.  
  
This channel is where I see the similarities in our systems.  
  
I then wait for a candle to **open** _and_**close** below/above the lower/upper channel band.  
  
If a candle opens and closes below the lower band, that is my signal for a short (sell).  
  
If at any point in time the candle closes back within the channel, I exit my position.  
  
  
I use various Fibonacci points where I move my stop loss to/from.  
The only times I exit my position without question is either at the 423 Fib, or the close within the channel.  
  
I'll give you an example of a trade I took:

Apologies for the poor image quality,  
  
I'm not sure why it did that, possibly because the actual images were too large and the upload re sized them.

simple is beautiful...  
  
You are comfortable with holding for a long period of time.  
I like lots of short trades. In and out a million times as it moves.  
Yeah, I know my broker loves me..  
But I can take advantage of the swings that more than makes up for the fees.  
  
I appreciate your sharing your strategy. I will be familiarizing myself with it a bit.  
  
Like I say simple is beautiful. Especially if it working....

I found a fatal flaw in my strategy. I was not careful about the exit strategy.  
I was following the dragon to find entries and trading large positions and exiting quickly. Big gains in a few minutes. That was great as long I was right every time. Kind of like "all or nothing". It works a lot of the time but when it doesn't- out of business.   
I knew it was a fatal weak spot but was not forced to do something about it until.... Casey lowered the boom..  
I have come out of the disaster a lot better for it.  
Not only have I dealt with the stop issue, but now also my entries are much better.  
Surrendering to using stops is one of those hurdles that must be dealt with in order to actually be successful in trading.   
Another one of those psychological issues.  
It's celebration time. I have met the enemy and it is me. I have conquered my lower self, the one with the bad habit and stubborn denial, by the strength of the higher self, the one with knowledge and intelligence.  
Failure is the pillar of success, someone famous once said.  
The template has been tweaked.  
By putting both the dss and the macd in the same window some very interesting patterns can be seen in the relationship between them.  
And adding the OSMA (40,50,100) the longer term trending can be seen easily at a glance.  
Great for scalping.   
will discuss stops next.

Is that a ziz zag ind?   
Looks simple enought. I don't like a lot of indicators on the screen either. Gets me confused

The xpma and the 8 ema have been removed.  
The ashi candles define the trend without their use. That is the added benefit of the ashi candles.  
I keep the 1m which is where I trade, the 5m and the 15m all open at the same time. 3 computers. 2 dinosaurs that basically only keep mtv4 running and my main system. I like to watch all the time frames to get a feel for the general direction things are going in.  
I look for macd divergences. and especially watch dss for oversold and overbought.   
I don't mean to be impersonal in describing the dragon. This just something like anatomy class..

Jiva, I have tried adding the Macd lines on the DSS but I don't know if you noticed already, the Macd lines shift vertically when you scroll the chart. After the fact, they look perfect but are actually misleading unless in a separate panel.  
I am using a Stochs 30,9,9 (just the main line) on top of my DSS 10/60 on the 1m chart. Less clutter. I find faster Stochs like 14,3,3 confusing and misleading as well. They are better with higher timeframe charts. This one catches the bigger moves and is great with divergence, both by itself and with DSS.  
On my chart I have 200 EMA(pink), 200 LWMA(purple) with bands 1, 2 and 3, 10LWMA,shift 3(yellow)  
I also discovered a great strength tool called the currecy strength meter that no one should trade without.   
Here is the link : <http://www.currencystrengthmeter.com/>  
Thanks to Henry Liu for making this unbeliavable tool available free.  
I would like to master the use of DSS because I think it is one of the best indicators ever.

I agree about dss. It's a gem. So easy to look at. It's really just a conventional stochastic but instead of lines crossing it is the dots changing colors. Really nice.  
will play around a bit with dss settings you suggest.  
About the macd shifting up and down when plotted along with dss. I think there may be a way to even use that. I see it but it doesn't confuse me somehow (probably because I'm already confused ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f615.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/2753.png?v=15.1) so I don't notice the difference...) I've just started using them in the same window and am working on trying to identify how their interaction in the window may help for signals. the vertical shifting could be part of it. It will take some time and lots of practicing to know for sure.   
Thanks also for the the strength meter I will definitely look into that.   
Will have time this weekend to explore and experiment.  
Your template looks good. Like it catches some nice entries.  
Hope you are enjoying this great trading adventure as much I am. Part sport, part science, part investment and a lot of self development...  
Who says there is no such thing as dragons!!!

Yes, fx trading is my career, hobby, passion, etc. It is really an adventure. And I absolutely agree on the confusion part. After trying out >1000 MT4 indicators (I am relatively new to MT4), I have decided to adopt the KISS style. That is why I like the DSS so much. It is plain and simple, no intertwining lines that keep quivering in real time.  
For me, the other real gem is the currency meter. Definitely incorporate it in your trading. Its best help is that it keeps you out of bad countertrend trades.  
I am looking forward to your input on the DSS.

Re: strengthmeter.. (the link you uploaded doesn't work, googling it works though)  
nice tool for surveying the pairs. I strictly trade the EURUSD so not practical for me.  
dss 10/60 a little too slow for me. I want to try to capture small moves.  
Faster is better for that even on 1m charts.

Thank you much for such a clean simple trading strategy.  
Have been practicing using a 5 ema channel offset 2.  
With the in and out system you described.  
Very nice.  
No offense to any dragon of course.  
But the simplicity of catching "his moves" in this way is very attractive.  
I can see how it is possible to catch many pips by finding good entry, being able to stay in the trade and a suitable exit.  
Very nice indeed.  
Thanks again for passing this along.   
Will definitely be trying this on live demo and in simulation.  
Simplicity is best...

I'm not completely stupid, I am well aware of the superiority of price action in determining direction.  
Just to say a negative is not complete, a positive alternative needs to be there.   
Do you have a strategy to go along with the chart? Something you can share to help viewers along.   
We are interested...

I tried your dragon method since i am also a dragon. I am quite amazed with the result. I might consider using it for stock.   
  
I caught a Dragon trade for EUR USD using the M15 chart. when it bounced to 1.35, then i ride it for 100 pips.   
  
Nice work.

some simulation practice with the channels..  
I have put a shi channel on the chart also and I like my macd with crossing alert.  
So the template is little crowded. but everything says something, there are no useless decorations...  
for exiting I am noticing that exiting if a close below the low channel occurs will keep me in a trade rather than exiting if there is simply a close within the channel, little more risk there so I will keep an eye out for that... The 2 examples on the screenshot show how I would have been out of the trade and missed some nice upside if I had exited simply on a close within the channel.  
Your original settings, 50 ma simple hi/lo channel is very nice.  
Of course, because of my nature, I had to try a bunch of settings, shiftings, ma types, so on and so on... but the 50 sma seems very good..  
I like to use the woody pivots, s/r for targets. not so much the Fibonacci, although I will slap a Fib on the chart every now and then...   
thanks for sharing this....  
This is like seeing the dragon in xray vision.

Am seeing some real potential "channeling" the dragon ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60e.png?v=15.1)  
Pretty potent stuff...  
using the 50 sma low as the trailing stop,   
and the break above 50 sma hi, marked by an open and a close above the 50 sma hi as the entrance for a long...  
keeping an eye out for woody pivots and s/r which tend to be good targets and launching pads.  
kudos to Xivali, the junior member who is trading rings around old timers...  
and so graciously has given his secrets for free.

Have a little time today, so what am I doing? Practicing and researching trading, what else?  
Very impressive results with the channel...  
This technique could be just what I have been looking for...  
Will need to have more confidence in the system so I don't exit too early.  
this will come with practice no doubt. Another way is to open multiple lots and do a series of partial exits on the way to the target.  
Another really good aspect of the channels is that if for one reason or another the trade turns bad, even when first entering the stop will only be at the 50sma which will be relatively nearby... = small loss.   
And because the stop trails the 50sma the amt of possible loss will only decrease as the trade progresses.  
Another plus, guaranteed to always be on the right side of the trade......

I just happened to be still looking at the charts after New York close when the feds did the surprise discount rate hike.  
I usually just shut everything down after New York, Sydney is always slow.   
But there it was. The big move and I just happened to have a short in place that I was getting ready to close out for a small loss, since I didn't want to hold it over to London. I had a limit order in place and it got taken out in a flash. Then the servers jammed (what what else is new?) and I couldn't back to the broker. Ugh..  
Finally the site came back up and the dragon said go for it...  
All said and done I caught the 100 pip move.  
That was just luck being there then. I never keep the system up at that time of day.

Hi Jiva,  
  
thanks for your outstanding work! This looks a lot like a strategy I am following anyways - I love HA, too.  
I'll dig through the pages this week.  
  
best regards,  
tradeigel.

more simulator trades.  
  
Again a testing of the stop that follows the 50 sma in this case 50 sma hi, confirms the continuation of the downtrend and also offers an opportunity to put fresh short positions in place.  
And again by following the 50 sma as the stop all the gains possible from the move are captured. I exited early because of s3 and the macd cross.  
s3 on the downside and r3 on the upside are usually about as far as the dragon will go in a day. Maybe he'll push past a bit, but then he tends to come back in if he goes beyond. That is a pretty big move for him. To go from the pivot point to s3 is really extreme.   
  
these practices are catching the USDCAD during some big moves. I will need to find more sedate sessions to see about false signals.

This is what I wanted to find out. False signals.  
Lots of false breakouts. How to tell the difference????  
Can catch a big trend but the consolidations are murder and false breakouts are murder.  
maybe a retest of the 50sma is a better entrance after a consolidation.  
for long, the ashi opens and closes above the 50 hi, but wait for the dragon to comeback to the 50 hi, if he doesn't close below the 50 hi on a retest it's safe to enter long on the next candle that opens and closes above the 50 hi?

looking at USDJPY maybe a set up for mkt open  
will keep an eye on this to see what happens.  
It's a little weird because the signal appeared just as the mkt was closing on Friday afternoon.

yes. This 50 sma channel is just the thing.  
first live trades . Little skittish. kept hopping in and out.  
But the technique is very good.  
Especially at Frankfurt and London opens.  
Since this is traded on the 15 min I can trade at work.  
Scalping at work was like asking for a nervous breakdown.  
But this only requires checking back every 15 mins or so.  
Set the stop and put a limit at a faraway target like s2 or s3 just in case there is rush caused by surprise news.   
And away we go.  
The pace is different from what I have been trading. 3 min trades..  
so I will have to get used to holding a position maybe all day. This technique will find those longer hold trades.

getting used to the strategy and developing confidence in it.  
Still jittery, when I see some gains I have fear that I will lose the gains (like that has never happened before, right?)   
but the technique is very powerful and how many times now I have seen that by following it the gains are there...  
So again today I jumped in and out when if I had simply stayed with the rules of the technique the gains were there.   
So I got a little maybe 20% of what was available...  
The next trade shows why I have the tendency to jump out when some gains are there.   
So it is the same old story all traders face, factoring in losses, taking them quickly and letting winners run.

took the loss here  
it happens  
data release to that point pointed to USD weakness, then other data reversed everything, so the signals were there for short.   
But the strategy is good because by placing the stop at the 50 hi, I am out of the trade early on.  
So if I follow the rules the losses will be small and the gains will be much greater.  
I just have to keep at it to gain the confidence in the system.   
Total for the day was 40 pips after a few more good trades and the USDCAD loss. It can be much more.

after the downbeat USD consumer confidence things moved pretty fast.  
Then there is the usual log jam with the broker trying to just get the site actually functioning.  
After all was said and done this worked out okay.  
It really was a fun day...

Looks like you understand the system well =]  
  
It IS fairly crucial to follow the rules to the letter every single time, and I have found that when you do this, and start taking some serious pips it become ALOT easier to do so =]

One thing I will add,  
  
when trading my channel system, If you are the trader who wants to capture the majority of the pips within a move then a more refined exit will be necessary - or so I have found.  
  
Rather than taking pips when price closes within channel, we will utilise another method.  
  
Of course, if price breaks 50 channel, and then within a few pips closes, by all means take whatever loss you were given.  
  
But then if it breaks straight away afterwards, take the trade!  
  
However, when riding a trade, I have found Fibonacci targets to be a more effective method for capturing a greater number of pips.  
  
So, what do I do?  
  
Riding a trade, at the 123 Fib or higher, I set my stop two Fibonacci levels down.  
  
So every Fibonacci level that I 'achieve' in the trade (broken above), I move my stop loss in order to maintain a two Fibonacci level distance between price.  
  
This works.  
  
There is nothing wrong with using the channel for all your exits, however I have found that this is far more effective, and nets you a greater deal more pips.  
  
Good Luck =]

Yes, the dragon is a creature of habit.  
This technique captures his moves very nicely.  
Would you post a screenshot illustrating how you set up stops using the fibs?  
We would all like to see.   
much thanks

Right, First thing you need is a handy tool called 'set Fib price'. (Attached)  
  
I take no credit for this, it is just something I have picked up.  
  
This, when installed, will show the price of a Fibonacci level you have pulled.  
  
So, firstly you need to pull your Fibonacci levels for your trade.  
  
Secondly you need to then open up your trade ticket, and modify it. Then type in your stop loss price, hit enter and bam, stop has been changed.  
  
Then when price in a move breaks (opens and closes above) a Fibonacci level, I then move my stop.  
  
Everytime price breaches a Fib level, my stop moves up a level.  
  
This should mean that your stop is always the second Fibonaccci level away from price location.  
  
I am also in debate as to whether or not I should edit the strategy to move my stop just one level away - but only when price is **about** to break a level.

Hey no worries Jiva,  
  
Anything you need give me a shout =]  
  
Taking out some time to study and blog on here, but afterward when I return to chart backtesting and trading, I will be downloading your dragon and back testing it to the extreme =]

gave the longer term trading strategy some effort  
I learn something from everyone.  
but somehow I just like my old friend the dragon as I am used to trading him.  
shorter term trades.  
lots of them during the day.

I have finished reading the system and have been trading it on a practice account. I think I like this method.  
  
Price seemed to be moving away from resistance and the 200 ema.  
The DSS was showing down all the way to the daily chart.  
All other signal lined up.  
  
The arrows show where I entered and exited.

Hi Jiva,  
Hope you're well.  
I haven't posted in ages, but still follow your thread and use the dragon.  
  
I've had quite a bit of interest in Renko blocks recently and yesterday thought i'd put your template on a 5 pip renko block chart.  
Visual backtesting is very interesting, entries with the 5 pip renko's look like they may have a higher probability for success.  
  
Might be worth having a look at?  
  
Wes

Hi Wes,  
There are some very good concepts discussed in this thread. Whatever effort you have put into trying to understand them and use them is not lost. Somehow the dragon has evolved a bit. I have started another thread:  
[http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...32#post3504232](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=3504232#post3504232)  
I don't want to unnecessarily confuse anyone and DRAGON II is a bit different from the original "dragon". The template looks different. Same dragon, just different appearance..

Dear dragon,  
Please take me back.  
I have strayed. But now I see how much I am attached to you above all others.  
There is none other like you. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and you are the most beautiful template I have ever seen. I can't take my eyes off of you. (Literally)  
You have give me so much, I am ever grateful.   
You have been with me during thick and thin. And seen my struggles and triumphs. You are a true friend.   
In silly foolishness I wondered off in search of better friends. They have all let me down.   
Please accept me once again. Speak to me and show me the wonderful things you show me. I am listening. I can hear you. All the other noises do not distract me anymore. For that is all that those other sounds are. Noise. Your sounds tell me what I need to know. In you sound and sight are the same. Seeing you is hearing you.   
Just see you have captured me.   
I can't leave you.

Lots going on here.  
bumping up against a trend line,  
downward move  
could be headed for support s1 at 1.3463 (shown on 15m screenshot going into Europe open...  
checking the time frames, 1h supports a down move.   
This could be significant since so many time frames are lining up for downside...

took the trade for 12 pips, but now I am stuck in online chat with the broker.  
Somehow they lost the trade..  
As if trying to get it right in the trade isn't hard enough then there is dealing with the broker on top of it all.  
These chat people all have a nasty attitude to boot.  
They do that I think to make up for their lack of knowledge...

My dragon at work...  
you know he's going to s1...  
my trades won't show up on mt4 since I am trading on a quote page with signal service. But dragon has given me +32 pips so far realized.   
I'll look for short again on strength...

maybe a little early, but the dragon is getting close to s1. Maybe a little retracing before he makes the final lunge. Don't want to miss s1...

Would expect a little pullback here.  
He may want to continue on to s2.  
He's dipped below the previous low on 2/25... He tested once before and a break below failed, this time he dipped below.  
Looks like a breather after that dramatic dip, and off to s2...  
that's +49 realized...

scenario no.2  
with a macd cross there will be significant divergence..  
so more upside, and possibly a double bottom on the 30m

interesting  
all sorts of influences converging here  
A favorite hang out is the pivot and the 200 ema.  
but there is also a longer term trend line here as well...  
that's a lot of resistance to have to break through to go higher.  
The day chart says oversold, but that can be like that (oversold) for ages.   
If I am not sure where he is going, there is no need to trade just for sake of trading. He may not know where he is going... If he doesn't know how am I supposed to know?

I would hesitate to trade short on the 1 m and the 5m given the 1hr chart.

watching the 1h resolve  
this may be a good point of entry short.  
a divergence in macd is resolved when macd either crosses 0 or rejects o.  
so it could be the turning point. The long term trend line has been reached.  
US equity markets are opening soon, EURUSD and DOW are closely correlated  
almost tick for tick..  
futures are up.   
if that upper trend line is breached there's some serious upside coming.

still waiting on that macd cross on the 15m  
just because dss is crossing down doesn;t mean the dragon has to move very much.  
dss is kind of like that he is thinking about moving down, but he might just leave at that, thinking about... macd crossing would track his actual moving ...

carried away by the macd cross on the 15 forgot to wait for the alignment on the 1m  
shouldn't be too much retracement before 1m turns around..

a similar cross on the 30m would be just the thing... to say the dragon is serious about going down

Hey Jiva, have you tested (compared results) on a 15/1 setup against the 5/1? ie using 15m crosses as the standard and then 1m as the entry on those crosses?

that could be it for the down move for a while  
macd on the 1h shows a clear neg divergence but has not crossed 0 or rejected 0, still approaching 0 which hints of upside...  
until the 1hr macd has been resolved there is likely not going to be much more downside. EURUSD is not actually trending anyway, the pair is consolidating and these moves are more or less just volatility.  
Anyway, I don't want to over trade. It's a bad practice.   
8 trades +75 pips  
That's it for me today.  

I don't know what I would do without my good friend, Mr. Dragon...

Hi, how's it going?  
  
_I got a little sidetracked for a while. Actually the train fell of the tracks altogether..  
_

[http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:Q...rriages416.jpg](http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:Qhs2aMiZbpjTcM:http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/44309000/jpg/_44309815_carriages416.jpg)  

I think you get the picture..  

  
But yes I use them all. I trade on the 1m but I flip through them all. The best trades are when the 1m lines up and the 5m is starting to line up and so is the 15m.  
It's rare to get em all to go at once, but that's a great confirmation.  
Usually the 1m starts the move, then the 5m kicks in and then the 1m starts to retrace, but the 15 is starting to follow the others. So when 1m finishes retracing and lines up and the 15 min lines up, that's a pretty good entry... at that point the 5 min is kind of in between.. So yeah, the 1m and the 15m are a great combo.  
  
Using that same line of reasoning by checking the 30m it is possible to see how strong the move is. If the 30 m lines up, well it's a pretty significant move, then look to see is 1h following the others? and so on... when I find a time frame that is obviously going the other way I can understand the strength and duration of the move. Well pretty much anyway....   
  
It's kind of like seeing animated cartooning. flipping through the pictures gives the appearance of movement. Neat stuff...

on this last series of trades I was waiting to see if the 30m macd would cross. If not I could understand it was 15m trade only (I use the 1m to enter and exit) but the 15m would define the total duration of the move. So the 30 min did not cross. So I was done trying to trade that move.

For me, I have been using a 1 hr 5m setup for quite some time  
and this, well my very similar version I really like on 15m  
and 1, then I have my 1hr charts open for the other setup  
so if the 15 and 1hr agree when the 15 signals, I know  
I can usually do a bit larger trades on those entries  
especially using the 1m as the actual entry ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Yes indeed, was glad to see you come back to your  
friendly Dragon. Its so easy to get sidetracked, or  
let one difficult day make you think you need to  
reinvent the wheel as well-lol. A good setup just  
requires us to stick with it and perfect our  
understanding of it.  
  
All the best, will be around of course! Hope you don't  
mind the company...lol

You are wise.   
If the dragon doesn't even know where he is going yet, how can we?   
He likes to hang out there, the 200ema and the pivot (thick yellow line). It is must be like a shady spot under a tree near a babbling brook or something.  
Also it is getting toward lunch time NY. Trading can be thin then as the institutional traders (the ones that trade big lots, millions) go out to eat their lunches. Personally I don't like to trade after 11:30am or 12 noon (est) unless there is some special data release scheduled, like FOMC...   
Trading is exciting and we like the excitement. But if the dragon isn't moving in a decisive way what is there to trade? He sleeping under a tree dreaming of going here and there and the dss is going all over the place and he isn't moving at all.   
We can't wake him up just because we want to trade. We have to wait until he gets up on his own and we just have to be ready.

I really like this strategy, although I would like to feel more confident I have seen many times where all the conditions meet up and the trade goes against you. I would like to see if we could work a bit more into filtering bad trades and "when to trade/not to trade" when to "Enter the trade when not to"  
  
Thanks again Jiva

Here is another simulator very popular and easy to use.   
  
Ps: Jiva, I'm still confused do we look for confirmation between charts on 15M and 1M or 5M and 1M... Also what are your considerations about filtering trades? what if the filtering conditions match in a higher time frame but in a lower they don't, Do we still take the trade? I need to hear some insights about it

Dragon up against long term trend line  
macd on all the time frames up to 1h have all turned over  
1hr getting ready to.  
dss heading down from over bought..  
  
h4 is questionable and suggest upside could still prevails...   
but the dss can go up and the dragon may not move or even sometimes he actually goes down. It is more or less measuring "what he is thinking" not necessarily what he is doing. He's a little schizophrenic that way..  
So why do I like dss?  
I like dss because for one thing dss can help to identify the trend.   
For instance is dss is going down like anything but the dragon is only moving slightly down, then it is most like a retracement not a reversal. And if dss is going up like anything and the dragon is going up like anything, that's the trend..  
The dss on this 4hr looks to me like consolidation. And a move back down is likely... moves up are equaling moves down both for the range of the dragon's movements and for dss...  
Anyway I entered short.  
I'm taking a target of the 200ema on the 5m.  
Almost open for European mkts.  
since Asia took thing up, possible Frankfurt open will take things down a bit..  
The neg divegence on the 15m says the move may be good for at least the 200ema on the 5m.

if the 1hr macd will cross could be some decent downside move  
that's it for data for aother 2 1/2 hours.  
German retail was more or less in line. No big surprises..

Yes. This is the question. We all would like to know that answer perfectly.  
  
Trading is a skill. It takes practice. Like any skill, the basics are learned first.  
  
Say with golf. How to stand. How to hold the club. How to measure the wind. The condition of the grass. The distance. The proper club, etc. etc etc. And ssshh don't talk on the tee.  
  
So how to know when to enter and when to exit.  
What I am using with a certain amount of success is following the dragon as he moves through the different time frames. If I see a set up on the 1 min I want to know is this just a hiccup or is he taking deep deep breath and about to embark.  
So I look at the where he is on the 5m. Is he about to go the other way from the 1m, then I might want to see his behavior on the 15m. And in this way try to put together a better idea of where he trying to go.  
  
This take practice. To flip through the time frames. Eventually it makes sense. Sometimes I am more interested in the 1m and the 5m and sometimes I give the 1m and 15m more attention. Things get really interesting when I start looking at 30m, 1hr, 4hr, etc.   
  
He does not move in a straight line. To look at just one time frame is linear, his moves are what is called curvilinear. So different cross sections of time can capture this curvileanar move wheareas just one time frame is 2 dimensional, multi time frames helps to get multi-dimensions.   
  
A book by JM Hurst one of the fathers of tech analysis written in the early 1900's (when calculations were all done by abacus and on fingers and toes) is very enlightening about this. Mr. Hurst was not a trader per se. He was a physicist and he used physics to analyze markets.   
He discusses this multi time frame aspect in great detail. It really open my eyes to charting in a whole new way.  
  
Recommended reading....books by JM Hurst..  
  
Some of the recent trades have been documented with screenshots showing somewhat the use of the time frames.  
  
Eventually the fog clear and a continuum becomes evident. Practice and more practice. Sleeping on it. Dreaming about it. voila.. Oh I see...

wedged, between trendline and 200ema 5m  
  
4hr and day show up side.  
if the dragon breaks above the trend line, serious upside....to retest weekly 200ema at 1.38 or so.   
My guess.  
So if breaks up trendline look for scalps buying dips...

1.38 looks reasonable for a retrace

So many things to consider...  
  
In looking at r1 as a target I neglected to consider how sometimes the r or s from the previous day is as far as the dragon will go. It doesn't happen all the time but it happens enough times to make it something that needs to be considered when setting a target.  
  
He has gone to r1 from yesterday _and it just so happens that's exactly where I entered._![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f62b.png?v=15.1)

Just the kind of market I'd really rather not try to trade. Lots of activity but going nowhere. Oh well I'm in it.   
Could be like this all day...

It's a love hate relationship.  
Tricky fellow.  
I should have know he was just waiting for me to close the position and then he would make a dash for r1.  
Jumped back in, caught 14 pips..  
Can't get angry at him though. He's just too cool....

That's it for today.  
total +20 pips.  
I'm happy to know I read the charts right.  
Even is I only got a partial benefit of the trade.  
Reading the charts right is the important thing. The confidence will get stronger.  
  
My guess is 1.38 near the weekly 200 ema as a retracement which closely coincides with the 4hr 200ema.  
Maybe today...  
Then back down to new lows...

something to watch for  
  
when dss has a big move from overbought to oversold, or vice versa  
but the dragon only moves a little it is a retracement not a reversal and the main trend is still in tact...

Little tricky here  
Mr. Tricky Dragon..  
  
dss did not complete the move up to overbought before dropping back down.   
the dragon's move down was not as dramatic as the drop in dss.  
and he is sitting on the pivot  
  
This is the 1h chart. I want to trade with a main trend so I try to see where 1hr is going so to feel confident about in and out scalping on the 1m..  
  
Heading into Frankfurt open, no data until GBP in 3hrs.  
important releases for several hours after that.  
  
Asian equities are down, futures are down significantly.

shorting for several hours now..  
waiting for the 4hr macd to cross.  
if it does, lots of downside for next few days...  
+73 in the pocket so far, shorting rallies.

It took forever and lots of nailbiting  
but the dragon did it, he hit s1  
all totaled inand out about 6 times.  
+100 pips.  
  
It's been 8hrs of laser focus...That's it for me for today.

I'm just watching.  
Not so enthused to jump into anything.  
Seems like the dragon is just drifting here and there.  
  
He's crawling along the top of a long term trend line, if he dips below it could mean s1 tgt.  
maybe London open..  
But after all it's Fiday, I don;tlike to trade on Friday generally.  
and data release is very light.. US has some data later..  
  
Although I mostly do scalp trades I like to be able to identify a trend so I can trade with it...

That's why I like to check across the other time frames.  
When the mkt is like this the dragon's jumpy.  
  
He can turn around and bite in the butt in a flash...  
  
I don't see any clear trade opps... I can wait. Maybe nothing all day. So what. When the opps come they are worth waiting for..  
If I feel the need to trade, I can use a demo or run the simulator just to keep active and awake...  
I really have to work at avoiding overtrading. It's a trap I've fallen into more than I care to admit.  
Take care..

The screenshot is the 30m. I would look for trades short on the 1m _**if**_ the dragon drops below the trend line.  
with tgt s1. I would look to scalp trade on the way to s1 by taking shorts on the 1m on swing highs where dss and macd line up exiting on macd crosses turning back up below 0.   
but who knows today?  
Futures are up respectably, there's no data until US opens and usually EURUSD follows equities.  
And don't forget it's FRIDAY..

Shady grove time.  
He's camped out in his favorite resting spot between the 200ema and the pivot.  
When he leaves there it could be significant.  
My guess is US data release.. Or maybe half hour or so before...  
I wouldn't be surprised to see him head for s1 then. 4hr chart has some downside pressure for dss and the otherr time frames could easily swing down by then..  
Anyway just watching for an identifiable trend...

The shi channels take a little getting used to but they can be very helpful.  
They do shift as he moves but they do that becasue they are following the trend and the short term trend changes, so they change. But the channels help to identify possible turning points.   
When the dragon is as an outer trend line he very often turns back, if he breaks out the trend lines will change in a little while to identify the new direction. The dashed median line is important. He will test that median and it also can be turning point.  
If the shi lines intersect with 200ema, ot a pivot, sup or res or trend line etc it can be especially significant.  
Just sensitive areas to give a little extra attention to. Not necessarily definite signals, just something to be a little attentive to.   
(Don't ask me what _shi_ _channels means, haven't the foggiest.)

Thanks. I often overtrade because I can't know if the trade is risky or not...  
I have to exercise more....

I know there are techniques that allow traders to trade lots of scalps in all kinds of markets. **  
  
I would love to get my hands on some of those techniques. **  
  
But trading the dragon means knowing the trend and scalping with it. And to be honest so far today I don't see anything definitive.   
  
Maybe around US open there will be some direction I can feel confident about.

I'd love see the dragon break below this trend line he has been creeping along for ever. **If** he does it would be s1 tgt.  
He's tested the pivot a couple times and failed...  
The 4hr still shows some downward pressure.  
Although macd 4hr is about to approach 0 and that could also mean a 0 line rejection rather than a cross.

1/2 hour to US data, employment figures....

In and out, 3 positions  
total +43  
  
something to watch out for is the the sup and resis from previous day, especially if the dragon did not quite reach the sup or res the day before.  
He will try to go to it the next day..  
  
In the screenshot, s1 from yesterday coincided with the shi trend channel.  
sure enough he stopped there and made a hasty retreat.

That might be it for me for today. I don't like to trade Fridays..  
Will keep an eye out for possibilities for a little while after US equities start trading..  
Don't expect much...And definitely no trades after lunch time New York...  
Have a good weekend.

Supposedly there is a Western dragon type, who is evil and must be slain.  
If there is such a thing, it must just be some evil cousin or something,  
the only dragon I know is the magnanimous one...

Trading the EURUSD for the last several months has been great. When the market went up EURUSD went up, when the market went down EURUSD went down. Pretty much tick for tick. But that correlation is breaking.   
Market goes up EURUSD goes down. Or goes up or goes nowhere.   
I was using equities movements to help gauge EURUSD but probably not anymore or at least not in the same way.  
  
Data is light this week. What will drive the market? News? ECB,FED comments?  
We shall see.   
  
In trying to identify a longer term trend so that scalping can be done in line with a trend here's what I am seeing. I will watch this for a while to see if I have it right and if so look to enter accordingly on the 1m.  
  
I would be looking for a trade just before or around Frankfurt open...

Very nice. That's the right idea... Yeah a little early. Looks like you saw the dragon heading down on 5 min and didn't wait for 1 min to line up. But it was still a good trade, just a little nail-biting during the retracing.. Looks like you had confidence in the set up so the retracing didn't cause a panic..  
  
Interesting how you are using OSMA...

Here's one reason why I see more upside at least to the weekly 200ema and probably beyond to the trend line, around 1.38  
  
the dss has gone all the way to oversold, but the dragon has hardly moved at all. That says shallow retracement and continuation of uptrend.  
  
I'm not opening a position based on that.   
  
But I am watching..

just not getting a clear picture of the action.  
will wait till later.   
Am at work trying to trade in between customers ad phone calls.  
Little distracting. Also only have a small laptop with me.  
Later at the trading desk I will have 3 screens and no interruptions...  
So unless something jumps out at me totally obvious I'm not going to open any positions for now.

Had a couple of decent trades. Nothing to write home about..  
But then late morning I wanted to catch the dragon short as he headed for the pivot. The trades are not in mt4 which I use for finding setups but are placed in an account that has a page with all the pairs on it, unbelievable, I sold the wrong pair..................................................![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f633.png?v=15.1)  
I wanted to sell EURUSD instead I hit the wrong button and sold GBPUSD at the very bottom of its run...  
By the time I figured out what had happened it was already -25 pips..  
Rode it out for a while and took the loss, -25 pips. If I had kept it over Asian session it would have been +25 but I didn't want to leave a position open if I couldn't monitor it.   
That's not the first time I've hit the wrong button on that trading page.   
As if trading isn't difficult enough just trying to decipher the charts then there is all the technical stuff, like brokers site jamming, hitting the wrong button, power outages, time out disconnects.... Yikes...  
It's the Wild West...

Could have stayed in longer,  
but in the middle of changing shifts at "work"  
_**Oh, for the day it's "bye bye.."**_  
I don't want to put that kind of pressure on my trading right now. Still learning so much...  

Eventually...

Here's what I look for.  
The 5m shows the macd cross and the alignment with dss that occurred a little while back.  
There is a trend line and 200ema that have acted a strong resistance on the 15m.  
But also in the 15m the same aligning is taking place with macd and dss..  
So even if the 5m retraces a little there is no need toe exit since this is showing a move down on the 15 now... As the 15m plays out, by the same logic attention would turn to the 30m to see if the down move will carry over there, if so then follow the move there and check later on with the 1hr etc..  
  
_note: I placed a sell order at the bottom (my specialty![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)) earlier today..   
I just kept it in place anyway and didn't take a stopout. I have a few longer term (weeks) positions anyway and just added it to the others since I see EURUSD ultimately as a short for the next few months._

This is playing out perfectly.  
The 15m now shows a downward trend, the 1m is retracing, and the 5m is in no man's land, could retrace or could continue down...  
the shi channels are helpful here.  
On the 15m the dragon has retreated from resistance at the upper shi channel/200 ema/trendline he will head for the median between the channels   
when he reaches the median he will consider again should he go back up and head for the upper channel again or cross the median and head for the lower channel...  
_This is a very likely scenario._ _Reminder nothing is set in stone!!!_

It appears to have a been a very brief retracement on the 1m and the downtrend may be resuming.  
  
Something of interest to note on the 1m.  
The dss went all the way into oversold but the macd did not cross up over 0.  
Another hint that this a brief retracing.

Tendency is to complicate. Today I trade the 5m. No consulting different time frames.  
practice session on simulator...(using 15m, 5min moves too fast on sim.)

Storytime:  
About complicating things:  
(Old Bengali-mother story...)  
  
The wife was complaining. Our house is too small. We need more room. The husband says I do not have so much money to make a bigger house. The wife complaining, complaining, complaining. The household was not peaceful because of the complaining.  
  
He went to his guru, "Oh, maharaja, please help me. I have no peace. House not big enough, house too small.. All the time complaining. What can I do?"  
Guru asks, "Do you have a cow?"  
"Yes, we have a cow."  
"Then put the cow in the house."  
"In the house?"  
"Yes, in the house."  
At home the wife is in disbelief, "In the house?"  
"Yes, guru maharaja's answer was, put the cow in the house."  
So, they put the cow in the house.  
What a mess. Big cow, in the house.  

[http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:W...nSwissHead.jpg](http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:Wh1kY9rq7AwJmM:http://www.larryschultzartist.com/Cow%2520Original/BrownSwissHead.jpg)  

  
The man returned to the guru, "Maharaja, it is not solving the problem.Problem is worse."  
Guru asks, "Does the cow have a calf?"  
"Yes, the cow has a calf."  
"Then put the calf in the house too."  
The wife is astounded. "The calf in the house too? Are you sure you are hearing guru maharaja properly? Maybe you are misunderstanding."  
"No, he definitely said to put the calf in the house too."  
It didn't take long for the man to return to the guru.   
"Did that solve the problem?"  
"No, no it is much worse. It is an impossible situation!"  

[http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:V...w-and-calf.jpg](http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:VjahrqRbwdmTGM:http://warkscol.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/mother-cow-and-calf.jpg)  

"Good. Now take the cow and the calf out of the house."  
So when he went home and they took the cow and the calf out of the house, the wife sighed, "Oh this is wonderful, so much room now."

got back in because of s1.   
The dragon will almost always go to the next s or r level. So s1 tgt  
(No doubt there will be some retracing, but the short is still on.)

although there is a macd cross and dss is in the proper direction, I would not take this trade long.  
dss is already overbought and macd has only now crossed  
I have not made a mental note of this type of configuration although I have seen it before. So I will monitor it to see if my suspicion is correct, that there is not much of an upside move to this... so for the future I may be able make a decision with some confidence.

Though DailyWoodPivot works well, I also like Fibonacci Pivot with TzPivotsD because it can be set timezone, so the value does not depend on broker's timezone.

Turns out a long position was good on the setup. I hesitated because dss was so far into overbought before macd crossed. But macd was far below 0 so I will make a mental note of it and see if that is a configuration that can be traded on in the future.  
Overthinking is trap, but I want to take as much of the gamble out of it as I can without crippling myself with too much cerebral functioning.  
If it is a configuration that can be counted on then that will take the cerebral strain out of the next time.  
Will be looking for a possible fresh short set up...

Usually the dragon will pullback to revisit the 200ema/pivot but maybenot this time...

Maybe this the wrong name for the thread. Maybe should be "Chicken" trades.  
Now I am getting the chicken mood.

about the fibs and time zones.  
I experimented a bit with the indi you are using. I went back to woodie. Seems to be aligned very nicely with the time zone my broker uses. So I just leave it at that.  
But the pivots and s/r are invaluable. I wouldn't dream of trading without them on the template.   
Notusing them seems would be like driving on a highway with no road markings or exit signs...

For trading EURUSD in case we hadn't noticed the day chart shows a consolidation pattern. When we come out of it the dragon's gonna fly, so to speak.... Until then it's "Where's the dramine?"

Could be a double top developing on 5m.  
if that macd divergence forms..  
Could give a good entry short on the dragon setup.

A test of the daily high, might be good for a reverse short. Wait and see....

problem is  
Even though there has been a neg macd divergence with dragon setup,  
the macd divergence has been a little compromised.  
  
when a divergence occurs but the macd touches 0 or crosses to the other side of the zero line and back again, it tends to neutralize the affect of a divergence.  
  
there is a dragon set up for short. but the trend is up.  
What to do?

Stay out? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
If you'd thrown an RSI indi up, there was good divergence there too.

Hi Jiva 34,  
Just thought i would throw out to anyone interested, if they like there  
charts as clean as i do, you con remove heiken ashi smoothed from your   
charts and replace it with a 20 sma. The HAS always changes color when  
it crosses it (i use bolinger bands with the center line highlighted)  
Also wanted to say that the dragon is fantastic. Just found this thread yesterday and was able to pick up an easy 45 pips.  
Great job and keep up the good work.

Thanks for kind words.  
There seem to be different themes for the different systems. C-4 blows up the train, 2bar-hi/low goes hunting like a cheetah, etc...   
we like to go for a ride on the dragon....

So many lessons. To stop trading would be for me to stop living.  
Lesson today. (Perhaps the lessons learned are the real value gained.)  

**RESPECT**  

Whenever I forget to show respect and appreciation for the dragon I run into problems...   
It is a relationship. I must learn to be happy with whatever the dragon allows me. The tendency is to try to take more and override the dragon.. No No...   
Doesn't work like that.   
Dragon will give. I cannot force or disrespect. He will show me if I am in the right state of mind. If not. I get kick..... Smacked. Run over. .. Pulverized.  
And otherwise beat up...  
I can't see a thing on the template. None of it makes any sense.   

Respect  
Respect  
Respect  

Such an important lesson. Who would have thought respect would be so important in trading. It is...  
When I don't show it that's when I realize how important respect is.  
Without respect I am blind. Respect acts like a window into another dimension.   
_Without respect I am denied access. It is very subtle. But undeniable._  
re·spect (r<http://img.tfd.com/hm/GIF/ibreve.gif>-sp<http://img.tfd.com/hm/GIF/ebreve.gif>kt<http://img.tfd.com/hm/GIF/prime.gif>)_tr.v._ **re·spect·ed** , **re·spect·ing** , **re·spects** **1.** To feel or show deferential regard for; esteem.  
**2.** To avoid violation of or interference with: respect the speed limit.  
**3.** To relate or refer to; concern.  
  
_n._**1.** A feeling of appreciative, often deferential regard; esteem. See Synonyms at [regard](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/regard).  
**2.** The state of being regarded with honor or esteem.  
**3.** Willingness to show consideration or appreciation.  
**4.** **respects** Polite expressions of consideration or deference: pay one's respects.  
**5.** A particular aspect, feature, or detail: In many respects this is an important decision.  
**6.** _Usage Problem_ Relation; reference. See Usage Note at [regard](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/regard).

Thanks will definitely investigate. We want to know his "haunts". ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
And he is definitely a creature of habit. He loves those pivots and s/r. He's hanging around just below r3 for that last few hours. Probably waiting for retail figures in a 1/2 hour. He doesn't usually go much higher than r3 on any given day unless there is big surprise.

That's twice now I was able to capture decent gains by setting stops and limits and walking away.  
Like a watched pot never boils...  
I'm sitting there watching every tick and inevitably exit way too early.  
But planning the trade and setting the stops and limits and walking away.  
(Actually taking a nap the first time and eating breakfast in the other room the second time.)  
Total between the 2 about 60 pips. I know if I had been watching with laser focus, it never would have been 60 pips... Fear. I might lose the little gains that started to show up...  
Will see about making this part of my trading strategy. Set it and go..  
Come back later...   
At least for some of the set ups....

Thanks for your system, when I download robby and macd indicators, metatrader do not recognize them not any, they are downloaded as attachment.php, what can it be wrong?  
Regards 

Indicators always obey Price, not the other way.

Jiva 34,  
I've been trying to figure out how to use a visual simulator for my forex system. How can I do it? Thanks

There are a few programs out there for mt4. The simplest one is "Training" by Denis Orlov. It's the one I use the most.  
  
Here's the link...  
  
<http://codebase.mql4.com/5969>  
  
Highly recommended to practice with a simulator.

Just a whole bunch of little ones.  
I read and study some of the other threads and systems. Try 'em out a bit.  
But I just keep coming back to the dragon.  
Have added 2 ma's and removed the 3 I was using.  
red is a 10 ema, and blue is 50 ema.  
The red 10ema cross of ashi smoothed is significant for trend change.  
Watching the interplay between the 2 ma's can be instructive. Help to stay in a trend.   
The further they are apart the more likely the end of the trend is approaching.  
the closer they are together the more likely a big move is coming.  
I will be watching how they act over the next little while in relation to the dragon's meanderings.   
And there is always the cross that confirms a trend is beginning.   
More on the ma's later.

There's so much more to successful trading, not the least of which is money management. Stop losses, position sizing, etc.  
  
Just being right about a trade is actually not enough. Because there will always be some bad trades, no matter how good a trader is.   
  
**Managing loss is the key to success._It is the cost of doing a trading business._**  
  
Trading the 1m I do not like to take more than a 10pip loss. If my entries are good then a 10pip stop loss should be more than sufficient.  
  
More than a 10pip loss is very difficult to make back trading the 1m. It would take several trades just to break even. To average between 5 and 10 pips gain is very acceptable on the 1m. So to take more than a 10 pip loss is a real setback.   
  
But to take the loss and move on is necessary. If the trade was not what I had estimated it to be, I want to get out.   
  
Part of deciding to enter a trade should always be to consider the stop loss. Is it worth it? Can I place a 10 pip sl safely?   
  
I only want to pay a possible 10pips to enter.   
  
I can't afford more than that... That's the budget...

1st trade of the day.  
A new calm has come over me for trading.  
By following the 10pip stop loss rule.  
Could things be that simple?  
that all the stress and anxiety can be so easily eliminated by strictly following the 10 pip rule?  
I think so.  
If the system is good, then the signals will be good the majority of the time.   
If the signal turned out to be false then get out...

This is the 30 min.  
My guess is that the dragon will go to yesterday's s1 which he didn't quite reach yesterday. He does that a lot. If he almost reached a support or resistance level the day before he will try to go to it the next day. Whether he then crashes on through to go further or not I can't get an idea of yet.  
Anyway a 10 pip cost to enter the trade for a possible 35 is good.

stopped out.  
I need to be careful of:  
not waiting ofr the 1m to give the actual signal.  
I need to remember and not get ahead of myself, that I only have 10 pips in the budget for a stop loss. If I take a signal on higher time frame 10 pips most likely will not be enough and I will get stopped out.  
So the actual signal has to be on the 1m even if I see all sorts of signals on the 30m or 15m. They can only help to support a signal on the 1m.   
But with 10 pips in mo pocket to buy a trade the signal has to be on the 1m.  
The screen shot shows how I got carried away with what I saw on the 30min. But did not wait for an entry on the 1m.  
The cost of educations...  
  
  
has some retracing to do.  
If I see the signal on the 1min will go back in short.

Let's try that again.  
entered short on signal 1m  
cross of macd.  
did not wait for 10ema to cross ashi smoothed  
(These are demo trades)

stopped out again  
(these are demo trades, I most likely would not take them in my live account)  
experimenting..  
both this trade and the past one were actually good trades.  
the limits I set were too great.  
I set limits and went into the other room.  
To monitor the trades and exit when macd turned back up they were worth about 3 or 4 pips each.

I don't know if anyone else has this or not, but I think I have some sort of weird phobia.  
I do very well trading short, but long positions I either just don't see them or misread them, and even have a kind of fear of them. It's very strange indeed.  
  
How to shake it I'm not sure have been dealing with it for a while.  
I prefer to trade EURUSD but if the trend is up it doesn;t work.  
  
What I may have to do is switch to USDCHF for short trades.  
Until I can see how to get rid of this phobia.  
Fear of heights?  
It's totally silly because trading pairs means one is always short against the other. So up is down and down is up all the time. It must be some visual problem...  
Anyway switched to USDCHF for some shorts and voila...

Maybe I've got something backwards..  
What I have been doing is looking at the 1m first to find a setup then checking the 5 and the 15..  
But what I may need to do is find a setup on the 15 and look for an entry on the 1m....(supported by the 5)  
So that's where this trade is.  
(I probably shouldn't trade at all on Fed day until after Fed speak)  
This is live account

that makes sense.  
Find the set up on the 15 and use the 1m for entry and exit

I was about to see a shrink, but since there are some other traders with the same symptoms, i feel relieved. Maybe it has to do with the fact that i a short rally, you see the previous high on your left on the chart and maybe your brain interprets the fact that you go short, that you are going back to earth where safety and stability is. To be honest, I have no clu.

Thanks buddy,  
thanks for speaking up about this.  
It's real. Another psychological hurdle. Maybe seeing the move down as natural, the force of gravity at work?  
Anyway if the trend is up for EURUSD I have to switch to USDCHF. I just can't see the setups the same way in an uptrend. Bizarre...

okay here's the thing!!!!  
That makes all the difference in the world. (Whether its right side up or not..)  
Use sell stop and buy stop!!!  
the screenshot shows the buy stop order that was not filled but the sell stop order that was and went on to make +30 pips.  
There was a bit of a small range bound consolidation for 3 or 4 hours.   
My head was pounding, headache to end all headaches!!  
I just set the 2 pending orders:  
Buy stop 2 pips above the top of the swing high  
and sell stop 2 pips below the swing low  
placed stops and limits at the same time and passed out.  
Woke up and voila. The sell stop had been filled and was at the tgt, just above s3...  
The dragon won't go much more than s3 or r3 on any one given day, usually....

Taiyakixz,  
Greetings..  
Noticed the ea has taken some trades against the macd and 10 ma.  
I think itmay be the fractals are overriding.  
Perhaps the fractals should be set for 1 mi lower fractal (pa going up)  
and 5 upper fractal (pa going down) rather using 5 min and 15 min...  
Other alternative is to s omehow give preference to the macd and ma over the fractals.  
I prefer changing the setting to 1m and 5m fractals...  
What say you.  
The results were promising.  
I did not have gmt set quite right. Entry bar/candle should be sometime after 8:30 am est. on the hour seems a good only choice, if a trend has developed it would be established by then (1/2 hour after news release) and run for some time as opposed to whipsaws and spikes.so 9:00 am est. How you got the trade to trigger at 8:30 (on the half hour)?Will run test for gmt +3 but that might put it a little late for entry. Would that make entry 9:30 est?

I will change the code to use 1m and 5m fractals and upload it later.  
If you set GMTOffset to 1 hour earlier, EA looks sma and macd at 7:30est.  
It makes sense....?

I tried to make the changes in the code but am not sure I did it correctly running the test may not have produced anything reliable.  
  
I just thought maybe it was the fractals causing the trades that were against the ma and macd, but maybe it is something else.  
_Do you you have any idea why a long would execute when ma and macd are down and vice versa?_  
If we get this fixed losing trades should be cut way back..  
I will try gmt 1 for testing...even as it is and will be eager for the changed codes.  
  
also:  
with the code the way it is (5m fractal and 15 min fractal) can we test using 1hr chart like Jeoff's ea? or other time frames or is there something in the code that makes it impractical to test time frames other than 15 min??

7:30 am est is entry candle 1 hr before data releases maybe too early. Better entry candle 1/2 hr or 1 hr after data release? 9:30, even 10:00? Sometimes trend reverses if data goes against expectations.

can you program in a profit target option? I think the trade is simply closing on the trailing stop. Even so if that is the case the results were surprising good. With no target only closing on trailing stop!!!  
You are very good programmer I see. Maybe I can learn something...  
Thank you.

EA looks the direction of ma and macd at 8:30est, then takes order between 9am to 10am.  
So if ma and macd are up at 8:30, EA will take long in spite of current ma and macd down.  
This is the reason why EA takes the opposite order with your posted chart.  
  
EA is only for 15m. I will change it, but it will take some time. Please wait.

This is the reason why EA takes the opposite order with your posted chart.  
  
_8:30 is too early. data comes out at 8:30. takes little while for trend to establish after news. Can we change that? maybe ea looks at 9:00?   
  
is there a way to adjust for that as an option or is it written into the code?  
  
I can wait. I hope this is not too much demand for you. Please do not feel pressured. I know it takes careful thought and much time to write these codes. Whatever you are able to do is nothing short of a miracle.  
  
Jeoff's ea catches Tokyo open. But does not work so well for 8:30 data releases. If we can come up with ea to catch 8:30 like his catches Tokyo that will be something!!  
  
I am putting every spare moment into study writing the codes. Still looks very much like Greek to me but little bit little bit.

jiva34,  
  
EA updated.  
  
\- EA looks 5m and 1m fractals.  
\- add parameter TakeProfit  
\- add parameter LookBackBars  
\- still only for 15m chart  
  
With LookBackBars, you can set which bar EA checks the direction.  
EA checks ma and macd direction at LookBackBars earlier than starting trade hour.  
trade hour starts at 9am, and the default LookBackBars is 1.  
So EA checks ma and macd at 8:45 that is 1 bar earlier than 9am.  
If you want to use ma and macd at 9am, set to LookBackBars to 0.  
If you want to use ma and macd at 8:30, set to LookBackBars to 2.  
In case of LookBackBars 0, the direction of ma and macd can change between 9am to 9:15, take care.  
  
  
To other members,  
this EA is for test and under discussing with jiva34. Do not use it with real trade.

these are generally big moves at US data release.  
set for bigger profit target and bigger stop loss decent results for EURJPY for 1 yr. want to test other pairs as well.  
tsl 80

1 yr  
set for regular stop 80  
tsl 80  
profit tgt 120  
  
looks like this ea can catch the trend but needs to have wiggle room so as not to get stopped out too early either stopped in loss or stopped in profit  
  
looks like changing the fractals was the right thing...

macd and 10sma may be even a better combination than 197sma and 10 sma.  
may not even be necessary to add robby dss stoch... or heiken ashi..  
then again maybe adding robby dss stoch will eliminate the losing trades altogether.  
  
after adding the robby dss to the tested chart the indi did not filter out any losing trades but in fact prevented some winning trades, even after trying several different settings. I think it would confuse things.  
  
Data is released usually at 8:30 am and that can cause a significant move but sometimes there is important data released again at 10:am. So the market can reverse at 10 or just stand still at 8:30 waiting for 10. So there will be some losing trades. How to minimize losses and maximize gains. Big profit target seems to work nicely. Some of these moves can be 200 to 300 pips in a day.  
Opening 2 positions and closing one after reasonable gains will help. Like Jeoff's eav9.   
  
want to test this pair EURJPY with dragon algorithm for Jeoff's Tokyo open.   
  
would like to test GBPUSD with dragon algorithm at Tokyo open  
can the ea be tested on pairs other than EURJPY?  
  
Great work, Taiyakixz, genius at work.. have a great weekend...

will be testing live demo.  
it may be that every day has to be considered differently   
check the calendar  
set up dragon for 8:30 data when that is the predominant data release  
set up dragon latter for 10 data release when that is predominant.  
it may be the stops and targets will need to be changed for a 10 data release day.  
will be testing for this live demo.

looks like Thursday and Friday are the days for data this week.  
So no setting up until then..  
Maybe will play around a bit to see if Dragon ea can catch moves around London open...  
the ea is set up for EURJPY at this point and only for 15 min chart.

Hi  
  
I've had the EA running since last evening and it still hasn't had any trades. Is anyone else getting any trades? Are there any settings that need to be set in a special way?

Hi,The ea is not really ready for trading. We are trying to develop it. There's no telling why you didn't get any orders filled. GMT settings, check the journal for error messages, etc.  
I am just learning programming, very very novice. Taiyakixz is the expert doing the programming. I was getting order send error 4107, and unmatched data errors. After a little research, as I say I m just learning I was able to fix the problem which comes from the famous problems with 4 and 5 digit brokers and data history. I am posting the fixed version on the first page as v3.  
Thanks for experimenting. Feedback welcome..

For general reference:  
  
order send error 4107  
and  
error unmatched data entry  
  
were fixed by replacing "ask" and "bid" in the code with  
  
NormalizeDouble(Ask,Digits)  
and  
NormalizeDouble(Bid,Digits)  
respectively  
  
Tester results were completely different as many many more trades were taken  
I will be rerunning the tester for various settings and also testing the demo live.

I have run v2a and it has all the errors:  
  
  
2010.06.08 09:27:48 2010.01.13 16:18 The Dragon EA testv2a EURJPY,M15: OrderSend error 4107

I changed the code for bid and ask,   
  
see [http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&postcount=403](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3782972&postcount=403)  
  
and the error messages are gone. I labeled the ea v3. It is on the first post.  
  
One thing is using macd and the 10sma is that they are very closely related.  
Signal line for macd is 9. So there will be more trades than using 10 and 197 but a lot of the trades may not be good.  
  
I am testing all sorts of combination of stops and moving averages. Will keep plugging away.

waiting to test on live demo for data release US mkts.  
But there has been absolutely no data releases Mon and Tues for US mkts.  
Tomorrow Ben speaks 10am est. that moves markets, usually favorably.  
Will set up dragon ea on demo to catch possible move for 10:15est.  
That's the plan, anyway.  
  
Backtest on the tester for a year is not all that helpful since it just runs for everyday. But some days there is no data release. Either 8:30 or 10:00 est.  
will set up Geoff's ea's also to compare..

I was all set up but something was wrong????  
No trades. I am taking care of my very old father, he had to go to the doctor in right around the time for monitoring the market activity. Oh well. These things happen. He is always going to the doctor for this or that. Part of getting old. He is 91. I try to keep him focused on the present moment as he will lapse into what he did in the past very easily. He tells the same stories over and over and over. yikes...  
Please keep me up to date on how this goes. I think it makes sense to only set up the dragon when there is an event, either important data or somethinglike fed speak. Which is no doubt part of what is driving the mkt today. They love to hear Ben speak.

no trade???? I will investigate but at the moment I have no idea....  
yesterday test failed because of connection trouble....but it would get some profit if no trouble.  
You are busy but you don't have to monitor during trading. Tell me if you find anything about the results.

This is an interesting setting for dss stoch. It seems to very closely mimic the macd.

gets more interesting as we go  
superimposing the 2 stoch settings signals appears  
needs some researching  
but looks like if the slow stoch, the thick one which corresponds to macd default is above oversold and is and the fast stoch is green above oversold it's safe to enter long and vice versa short.  
Looks like the dragon has found some friends to play with...

Hi Freddy.  
Have seen you around ff.  
Thanks for stopping by.  
Have been busy with Geoff's ea and kind of neglected my old friend the dragon.  
[Taiyakixz](http://www.forexfactory.com/member.php?u=124426) has been working on coding an ea for the dragon but dss stoch was a missing piece of the puzzle. With these new settings that problem may have been solved. Willbe spending more time here, but the Dragon is headed for an ea. Not having to stare at the screen for hours on end is a great blessing. (No offense meant, dragon, you are still beautiful.)  
Nothing to update just yet. Need to get with [Taiyakixz](http://www.forexfactory.com/member.php?u=124426) about this new finding.   
Happy trails...

Hi Steve,  
There is a basic algorithm for the dragon developing. Which will allow for a totally mechanical trading strategy and hence an ea. In the meantime check out <http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=231650>  
for a very successful ea..., active trading, and informative discussions...

Jiva, yes, I know where you hang around.  
  
I am also more then tired of getting glued to these monitors for so many hrs.  
In one way or another it tends to become addictive.  
Then you start seeing a trade where there is actually none, I guess out of boredom...........and then the adrenaline level goes up, and you feel part of it all again.  
  
That other EA I am testing as well, interesting, but a bit too quiet to my real liking. Still, pips are pips, and had so far 4 winners and 1 loser, which was Sunday opening of our brokers.  
  
Will set The Dragon up later this morning.  
Am using DSS already, but not as a main indi. If you don't watch it, one starts adding indis over indi and they basically do ALL the same.

YEAH, just noticed that.  
  
Having the week off from active trading, so in no real hurry to check charts when I get to the screens.  
  
You may also want to have a look at this thread:

I agree Geoff's indi is very good. Albeit only once a day if conditions allow.  
I am looking to set up several eas. Geoff's is definitely one of them. The dragon made into an ea will be a prize winner. I am thinking to set it for trading only during active times, mkt opens, data releases etc..   
Yes it is true, if I start to add more and more indis I know I am losing my focus. Pretty soon the chart is so cluttered I can't even see the candles. It's a disease!!  
this stoch cross is very interesting. the slow stochastic is actually a mimic of the macd default. When they cross in either overbought or oversold the signals are good, even on the 5 min which tends to be a little schizophrenic.  
Once an entry strategy is found to be reliable, then the necessity for managing the trade is there. Targets, stops, trailing stops, lot size etc. Then the ea can be coded.

the significance of mkt times cannot be over estimated.  
this move was at US forex open and data release, around 8:30am est.  
for short term traders it makes no sense to trade at other times.

The managing part of Geoffs EA would already be a terrific start, I would say.  
Then you can have it enter a trade with whatever amount of lots you set it and let it do its thing.  
  
Just my 2 cents.

1st tgt reached +20  
(not the best time to enter a trade  
mkt is slow and lunch time NY  
but if this is an ea it will go by signals and the buy signal was there.   
(unless the ea has the settings for when to buy based on time of day)  
was not at the screen when the tgt hit, so did not move stop for 2nd position. the ea would have done that and been stopped out on the 2nd position for +4.  
however the 2nd position is still open so will trail it when it goes 20 pips again...

buy signal EURUSD 1hr  
2 positions  
1st tgt +20  
2nd tgt +40  
stop loss 120  
to trail 11 pips after 1 tgt.  
on second thought may have entered 1 bar too early. The cross should be fixed, that is the cross should be there after the bar closes.  
In this practice the bar has not closed yet. It has another 46 minutes to run, anything can happen in 46 mins...  
So the ea would not have entered long here. It will stick strictly to the rules.... The benefit of using a robot...

AUDUSD is setting up, but the bar will have to close to confirm the cross. And there is 56 min left for the close of the bar.

Since there is so much construction going on and the system is changing so quickly this discussion is being moved to the platform tech thread.
